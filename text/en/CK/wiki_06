<text>The Oldsmobile Omega is a compact car manufactured and marketed from 1973 to 1984 by Oldsmobile, as the brand&#x27;s most affordable, entry level vehicle — across three distinct generations.

The first two generations of the Omega used rear-wheel-drive configuration, as a badge engineered variant of the Chevrolet Nova. The third generation was marketed from 1980 to 1984 in a front-wheel-drive, as a variation of the Chevrolet Citation.

The &quot;omega&quot; nameplate derived from the last letter of the Greek alphabet. 

== First generation (1973–1974) ==


The Omega was one of three X-body Chevrolet Nova clones. It and the Buick Apollo were introduced in 1973; the Pontiac Ventura had been introduced in 1971. Naturally it shared the Nova&#x27;s body and many of its mechanicals, but it had its own unique nose and tail, and, being an Oldsmobile, it had a little fancier trim than the Nova. It even borrowed the Nova&#x27;s dashboard, but Olds added woodgrain trim to it for a more upscale look.

The front grille sported Oldsmobile&#x27;s trademark split &quot;waterfall&quot; grille design, round headlights set into square recesses, and parking lights directly below in the bumper. Body styles mirrored that of the Nova, including a 2-door coupe, 3-door hatchback, or a 4-door sedan.

Engine choices were the standard Chevy-built 4.1-litre (250 cid) I6 with a 3-speed manual transmission standard, with a 4-speed manual or a 2- or 3-speed automatic optional. The lone V8 was Oldsmobile&#x27;s 5.7 L (350 cid) &quot;Rocket&quot; V8, which had a 4-speed manual as standard with the 3-speed automatic optional. V8 models with the fifth VIN digit being the letter &quot;K&quot; received a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor. All other V8 engines received the standard 2-barrel version. There were also 53 &quot;Doctor Oldsmobile Omega&quot; built in 1973. All were V8&#x27;s built in Van Nuys, California and were sold at Century Oldsmobile in Van Nuys, California. This decal option was canceled in 1974.

There were few changes in 1974. There was a base model and the upper-level Brougham and the S option was added. The parking lights were relocated inboard below the grille instead of the headlights and there was a new rear bumper design which met the federal government&#x27;s new 5-mph impact standards. The 2-speed Powerglide transmission was dropped.
== Second generation (1975–1979) ==
This car was the top of the X-body line along with Buick&#x27;s Apollo and Skylark, having more luxury trimming, more noise insulation, rear anti-roll bars, and other features not found on the Chevrolet Nova. There were four basic Oldsmobile X bodied cars, the F-85 (the base car), the Omega, Omega SX, and the Omega Brougham. During the 1975-76 model years, the top engine choice was a 350 cu. in. (5.7 Liter) V8 from GM&#x27;s Buick division. During that time, the base engine was the 250 cu. in. (4.1 Liter) inline-6 from Chevrolet, until 1977 when it was dropped in favor of the lighter Buick 231 V6. It saw few changes through its life being limited mostly to the front end (with three different grille designs) and to the rear lights, changing the number of lenses through the years. The Oldsmobile 260 (4.3-liter) V8 was available as an option from 1975 to 1979.


== Third generation (1980–1984) ==


The X-bodies were all-new front-wheel drive cars for 1980. Engine choices included Pontiac&#x27;s Iron Duke inline-four engine and the new corporate 2.8 L LE2 V6 designed specifically for this platform. Transmissions were the 4 speed manual or the TH125 3-speed automatic.

Unlike the Chevrolet Citation, which the car was based on, the Omega range consisted of a 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan, with upright styling and a split grille.

Aside from the standard and Brougham models offered of the duration of production, sportier models were also offered. These included the SX coupe (replaced by the ES in 1982), ES sedan. The SportOmega pioneered urethane plastic fenders in 1981 and featured red-and-orange striping, white-over-gray paint, and a sloping front grille shared with the SX and ES. Notably, the sportier models were available with both the L4 and V6 engines.

Beginning in 1982, the Chevrolet high-output (130 horsepower) 2.8L V6 became available on ES models. In 1983, the ES was only available in the sedan body style.

The X-body Omega, like its rebadged variants (the Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix and Buick Skylark), proved fairly trouble-prone early on, necessitating a number of government-mandated recalls for braking problems, fluid leaks and suspension issues. While Omega was the only one of the four X-cars to sell better in 1981 than in 1980 (147,918 versus 134,323), starting in 1982, production fell dramatically. Only 77,469 Omegas were built in &#x27;82, with 53,926 in 1983 and 52,986 in swan-song 1984.

For 1985, the Omega was replaced by the N-body Calais.

<text>The Pontiac Phoenix was a compact car that was sold from 1977 to 1984 by Pontiac. There were two generations of the Phoenix, both based on popular Chevrolet models, and both using the GM X platform designation. It was named for the mythological Phoenix, which would die in a self-inflicted fire and be reborn from the ashes. The Phoenix was replaced by the Grand Am in 1985.


==First generation (1977–1979)==
The rear-wheel drive Phoenix was introduced for 1977 as an upscale version of the Pontiac Ventura, and replaced the Ventura entirely for 1978. The Phoenix differed from the Ventura in only minor details such as the grille and its square headlights and yellow rear turn signals. The Phoenix was available as a 2-door coupe or a 4-door sedan, with a 3-door hatchback available beginning in 1978. There were two trim levels available, the base and LJ, with a performance-oriented SJ package as an option.

Available engines included Pontiac&#x27;s then-new &quot;Iron Duke&quot; I4, a Buick V6, a Chevrolet &quot;LG3&quot; V8, and a Chevrolet V8. Transmission choices included a 3-speed manual (available with either column or floor shift), 4-speed manual, or a 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic.

==Second generation (1980–1984)==

For 1980, the Phoenix was downsized and moved to the front-wheel drive X platform, and was available as a 2-door coupe or a 5-door hatchback. It was the first front-wheel drive production model from Pontiac. The base and LJ models were still available for this generation, as was the SJ trim package; the SJ package was made as a full trim level for 1982. There was a minor exterior refresh and a new PJ model for 1983, followed by a name change for the LJ and SJ to LE and SE, respectively, for the 1984 model year.

Available engines were a 2.5 L &quot;Iron Duke&quot; 4-cylinder, carried over from the previous Phoenix, and a new 2.8 L &quot;LE2&quot; V6, both of which were mated to a standard 4-speed manual transmission or optional 3-speed automatic. The high-output 2.8 L &quot;LH7&quot; V6 was standard on the Phoenix SJ/SE for 1982 and was available as an option for all other Phoenix models.

As with its sister cars (the Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega), the Phoenix&#x27;s image suffered because of poor workmanship, two recalls for 1981, and a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon emergency braking (1980 models only).

The Phoenix was replaced for 1985 by a revived Grand Am on the front-wheel drive GM N-body platform, while the Phoenix&#x27;s basic architecture lived on under the A-body Pontiac 6000, which was introduced in 1982.

<doc id="1118464" wikidata="Q448487" url="?curid=1118464" title="Albariño">
<text>Albariño () or Alvarinho () is a variety of white wine grape grown in Galicia (northwest Spain) and in Northwest Portugal (Monção and Melgaço, Alto Minho) where it is also used to make varietal white wines. Albariño is the name for the grape in Galician. In Portugal it is known as Alvarinho, and sometimes as Cainho Branco.

It was once thought that Albariño/Alvarinho was brought to Iberia by monks from the monastery of Cluny in the twelfth century, but recent studies point to Albariño/Alvarinho being native to Galicia/Portugal. Both the Galician &quot;Albariño&quot; and the Portuguese &quot;Alvarinho&quot;, derive from &quot;albo&quot;&lt;&quot;albus&quot;, meaning &quot;white, whitish&quot;. It has also been theorized that the grape is a close relative of the French grape Petit Manseng.

It should not be confused with Alvarinho Lilás (Madeira), Albarín Blanco (Asturias in Northern Spain), Albillo Real, Azal, Caiño Blanco (O Rosal in Galicia and Portugal), Galego Dourado, Savagnin Blanc (Galicia, France, Australia), or Verdeca (Puglia in Italy).

==Major regions==
Spain produces Albariño to a significant degree in the Rías Baixas DO, as well as in Barbanza e Iria. In Portugal Alvarinho is common in the Vinho Verde region, but it is only authorized to be grown in Monção and Melgaço. In other locations such as Ribeiro, Lima, or Braga it is often mixed with other grapes such as Loureiro, Godelho, Cainho or Borraçal, Arinto or Treixadura to produce blended wines. Such blends were common throughout Galicia too until about 1985; when the Rías Baixas DO was established in 1986, Albariño began to emerge as a variety, both locally and internationally. Its emergence as a variety led the wines to be &quot;crafted for the palates of Europe, America and beyond and for wine drinkers who wanted clean flavors and rich, ripe fruit&quot; and led to wines completely different from those produced across the river in Portugal.

Albariño is now produced in several California regions including the Santa Ynez Valley, Clarksburg, Napa, Edna Valley and Los Carneros AVAs. Albariño is also produced in Oregon, first by Abacela Winery in the Umpqua Valley AVA, and in Washington state.

Albariño is also grown in Uruguay and is produced as a varietal by Bodegas Garzon.

Albariño has also attracted the attention of Australian winemakers, several of whom produce varietal wines. However, it was discovered that grape growers and wine makers in Australia had been supplying and selling wrongly labelled Albariño for over a decade. A French expert visiting Australia raised questions in 2008, and DNA testing confirmed that the grapes thought to be Albariño were in fact French Savagnin and almost all wine in Australia labelled as Albariño is Savagnin.

==Wine characteristics==
The grape is noted for its distinctive botanical aroma with a citrus undertone, very similar to that of Viognier, Gewurztraminer, and Petit Manseng, suggesting apricot and peach. The wine produced is unusually light, and generally high in acidity with alcohol levels of 11.5–12.5%. Its thick skins and large number of pips can cause residual bitterness.

==Viticulture==

For hundreds of years, Alvarinho/Albariño vines could be found growing around the trunks of poplar trees and in bushes along the outside margins of fields—a practice which some growers still use in Portugal&#x27;s Vinho Verde region. In the middle of the century, however, growers made big investments and became professional grape growers. In Vinho Verde, the vines are typically trained on high pergolas, which encourages over-cropping, often leading to grapes that are unable to exceed more than 8.5% potential alcohol. When grown in a vineyard, the vines need to be wire trained with large canopies to accommodate the 30 to 40 buds per shoot that is typical. The grape responds well to the heat and humidity though the high yields and bunching of clusters usually keep the grapes within the margins of ripeness.

==Synonyms==
Alvarinho/Albariño is also known under the synonyms Albelleiro, Alvarin Blanco, Azal Blanco, Galego, Galeguinho, and Padernã.

<text>Shakey&#x27;s Pizza is a pizza restaurant chain based in the United States and the Philippines. Founded in 1954, it was the first franchise pizza chain in the United States. In 1968, the chain had 342 locations. The chain had about 500 stores globally, and 58 in the United States, as of July 2019. Currently, the stores can be found in the states of California and Washington, as well as in the Philippines, Singapore and Japan.

==History==

Shakey&#x27;s Pizza was founded in Sacramento, California, on April 30, 1954, by Sherwood &quot;Shakey&quot; Johnson and Ed Plummer. Johnson&#x27;s nickname resulted from nerve damage following a bout of malaria suffered during World War II. The parlor opened on a weekend, but since the pizza ovens were not yet completed only beer was served. Shakey took the profits from beer sales and bought ingredients for pizza the following Monday.

Shakey personally played Dixieland jazz piano to entertain patrons, also hiring the original members of the Silver Dollar Jazz Band, paying the musicians $10 each plus all the beer and pizza they wanted. (Shakey soon realized it was cheaper to pay the musicians scale). This brought the music of Lu Watters to the Sacramento area and caused a local sensation. Jazz historian K.O. Eckland has given this band the credit for the jazz revival in Sacramento that extended to the formation of the Sacramento Traditional Jazz Society. Shakey&#x27;s also became known outside Sacramento, not for its pizza, but for the jazz program it sponsored on a regional radio network. Shakey Johnson is honored in the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for his longtime use of banjo music at his pizza parlors. Other live music, including piano, was also a staple in the old Shakey&#x27;s parlors. Up until the early 1970s printed menus included lyrics to classic barbershop songs so that the customers could sing along with the band while their meals were being prepared.

The original parlor (a remodeled grocery store) at 57th and J Streets in Sacramento remained in business until the mid-1990s.

The second Shakey&#x27;s Pizza Parlor opened in Portland, Oregon, in 1956. Shakey&#x27;s opened their third parlor in Albany, Oregon, in 1959, which was the first building Shakey&#x27;s actually owned and the first building to be built in the distinct building style for which Shakey&#x27;s is known. It now operates as a used bookstore. According to Johnson, Shakey&#x27;s Pizza engaged in little market research and made most of its decisions on where to locate stores by going where Kinney Shoes opened stores. By the time Johnson sold his interest in 1967, there were 272 Shakey&#x27;s Pizza Parlors in the United States. The first international store opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in 1968. By 1975, the company had expanded to the Pacific Rim, including Japan (in 1973) and the Philippines (in 1975).

By the early 1970s, Shakey&#x27;s had become popular with families and youth sports groups in Southern California. The long rows of picnic tables end-on-end facilitated large groups. Youth sports teams would go to Shakey&#x27;s after their weekend games, where the kids could eat pizza and have fun, and the parents could drink beer and socialize. In fact, the advertising motto for Shakey&#x27;s was &quot;We serve fun at Shakey&#x27;s... also pizza&quot;. One of the features of Shakey&#x27;s was its large windows between the dining hall and the kitchen. One could order pizza and then watch as the dough was prepared, sauce and toppings added, and then pizza slid into the oven. Kids enjoyed watching the process and running to tell their parents when the pizza came out of the oven.

===Philippines===

The brand became a well-established franchise in the Philippines, where it began in 1975 under the ownership of the country&#x27;s largest food conglomerate, San Miguel Corporation, primarily promoting their San Miguel draft beer. Beginning with a restaurant located in Makati Avenue, Makati, the restaurant expanded rapidly in Metro Manila, with most of its outlets offering live music. San Miguel had difficulty maintaining the consistency of the branches, and ultimately sold the franchise in 1987 to International Family Food Services, Inc. (IFFSI), a group led by the family of sports executive Leo Prieto. By 1997, it had evolved into mostly a fast-food franchise. In 2003, the company began &quot;reengineering&quot; the brand as a family-oriented casual dining brand. In 2004, Shakey&#x27;s partnered with Sports Vision for the launch of the Shakey&#x27;s V-League, one of the pioneering volleyball leagues in the country.

As of early 2015, there were 153 Shakey&#x27;s outlets in the Philippines, more than double the number remaining in the United States.

In March 2016, the Century Pacific Group and the Singapore-based GIC Private Limited acquired the majority shares of IFFSI from the Prieto family, which will retain a minority interest in the company. In October 2016, IFFSI changed its name to Shakey&#x27;s Pizza Asia Ventures Inc. (SPAVI) and became listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange on December 15, 2016 with the ticker symbol . It was disclosed that IFFSI acquired ownership of the Shakey&#x27;s trademark in the Philippines since 1999 and also owns the trademark rights for the Middle East, Asia (except Japan and Malaysia), China, India, Australia and New Zealand. Circa 2017, it signed a joint venture deal to bring the brand to Kuwait.

SPAVI has garnered several recognitions over time. The company ranked in Financial Times&#x27; feature on Asia-Pacific&#x27;s 500 high-growth companies in 2020 and 2021. It was also hailed as the &quot;Philippines&#x27; Best Small Cap Company&quot; by Finance Asia in 2018.

The Shakey&#x27;s Super League was formally launched on August 16, 2022, at the Shakey&#x27;s Pizza ASEANA outlet in Parañaque. This marks the return of Shakey&#x27;s Pizza in Philippine volleyball since they served as the title sponsor for the Shakey&#x27;s V-League (now Premier Volleyball League) from 2004 to 2017.

On September 30, 2024, SPAVI announced the incorporation of an American subsidiary that would own and operate and franchise stores in the United States.

===Ownership changes and decline===
Shakey Johnson sold his half of the company for $3 million to Colorado Milling and Elevator in 1967, which acquired Plummer&#x27;s half for $9 million the next year when Colorado Milling merged with Great Western Sugar Company to become Great Western United Corporation.

In 1974, Shakey&#x27;s was sold from Great Western to Hunt International Resources, famous for their attempt to corner the silver market. At the time Hunt International bought Shakey&#x27;s in 1974, the restaurant chain had approximately 500 stores throughout the United States, including stores as far east as Latham, New York and Westbrook, Maine.

Two franchisees bought the chain in 1984 and they sold out to Inno-Pacific Holdings of Singapore in 1989. By that time, the number of franchises had declined to 221. Most of the remaining U. S. stores closed during the time Inno-Pacific owned the chain. Some of the remaining franchisees took Inno-Pacific to court in 2003. Before the case could come to trial, Shakey&#x27;s was sold to Jacmar Companies of Alhambra, California in 2004. Jacmar had been the franchisee of 19 Shakey&#x27;s restaurants.

, there were 51 Shakey&#x27;s Pizza restaurants in the United States - 48 of the locations are in California (all, except Oroville, are in Southern California), and two in Washington. The last location east of the Mississippi River, in Auburn, Alabama, closed in April 2019. The location in Renton, Washington closed on January 20, 2025, leaving Pasco as the only remaining Washington location. 

There are six locations in the Greater Mexico City metro area.

All locations closed their dining rooms in mid-March 2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with take-out service still available. Dining rooms re-opened in May 2021.

<doc id="1118477" wikidata="Q335088" url="?curid=1118477" title="Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia">
<text>The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (), also known as Cilician Armenia (, or ), Lesser Armenia, Little Armenia or New Armenia, and formerly known as the Armenian Principality of Cilicia (), was an Armenian state formed during the High Middle Ages by Armenian refugees fleeing the Seljuk invasion of Armenia. Located outside the Armenian Highlands and distinct from the Kingdom of Armenia of antiquity, it was centered in the Cilicia region northwest of the Gulf of Alexandretta.

The kingdom had its origins in the principality founded by the Rubenid dynasty, an alleged offshoot of the larger Bagratuni dynasty, which at various times had held the throne of Armenia. Their capital was originally at Tarsus, and later moved to Sis. Cilicia was a strong ally of the European Crusaders, and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. It also served as a focal point for Armenian cultural production, since Armenia proper was under foreign occupation at the time. Cilicia&#x27;s significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region. 

In 1198, with the crowning of Leo I, King of Armenia of the Rubenid dynasty, Cilician Armenia became a kingdom. In 1226, the crown was passed to the rival Hethumid dynasty through Leo&#x27;s daughter Isabella&#x27;s second husband, Hethum I. As the Mongols conquered vast regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, Hethum and succeeding Hethumid rulers sought to create an Armeno-Mongol alliance against common Muslim foes, most notably the Mamluks. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Crusader states and the Mongol Ilkhanate disintegrated, leaving the Armenian Kingdom without any regional allies. After relentless attacks by the Mamluks in Egypt in the fourteenth century, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, then under the rule of the Lusignan dynasty and mired in an internal religious conflict, finally fell in 1375.

Commercial and military interactions with Europeans brought new Western influences to the Cilician Armenian society. Many aspects of Western European life were adopted by the nobility including chivalry, fashions in clothing, and the use of French titles, names, and language. Moreover, the organization of the Cilician society shifted from its traditional system to become closer to Western feudalism. The European Crusaders themselves borrowed know-how, such as elements of Armenian castle-building and church architecture. Cilician Armenia thrived economically, with the port of Ayas serving as a center for East–West trade.

==History==

===Early Armenian migrations to Cilicia===

====Cilicia under Tigranes the Great====
Armenian presence in Cilicia dates back to the first century BC, when under Tigranes the Great, the Kingdom of Armenia expanded and conquered a vast region in the Levant. In 83 BC, the Greek aristocracy of Seleucid Syria, weakened by a bloody civil war, offered their allegiance to the ambitious Armenian king. Tigranes then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively ending the Seleucid Empire. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais (modern Acre). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to the new metropolis of Tigranakert (). At its height, Tigranes&#x27; Armenian Empire extended from the Pontic Alps to Mesopotamia, and from the Caspian to the Mediterranean. Tigranes invaded as far southeast as the Parthian capital of Ecbatana, located in modern-day western Iran. In 27 BC, the Roman Empire conquered Cilicia and transformed it into one of its eastern provinces.

====Mass Armenian migration under the Byzantine Empire====
After the 395 AD partition of the Roman Empire into halves, Cilicia became incorporated into the Eastern Roman Empire, also called the Byzantine Empire. In the sixth century AD, Armenian families relocated to Byzantine territories. Many served in the Byzantine army as soldiers or as generals, and rose to prominent imperial positions.

Cilicia fell to Arab invasions in the seventh century and was entirely incorporated into the Rashidun Caliphate. However, the Caliphate failed to gain a permanent foothold in Anatolia, as Cilicia was reconquered in the year 965 by Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas. The Caliphate&#x27;s occupation of Cilicia and of other areas in Asia Minor led many Armenians to seek refuge and protection further west in the Byzantine Empire, which created demographic imbalances in the region. In order to better protect their eastern territories after their reconquest, the Byzantines resorted largely to a policy of mass transfer and relocation of native populations within the Empire&#x27;s borders. Nicephorus thus expelled the Muslims living in Cilicia, and encouraged Christians from Syria and Armenia to settle in the region. Emperor Basil II (976–1025) tried to expand into Armenian Vaspurakan in the east and Arab-held Syria towards the south. As a result of the Byzantine military campaigns, the Armenians spread into Cappadocia, and eastward from Cilicia into the mountainous areas of northern Syria and Mesopotamia.

The formal annexation of Greater Armenia to the Byzantine Empire in 1045 and its conquest by the Seljuk Turks 19 years later caused two new waves of Armenian migration to Cilicia. The Armenians could not re-establish an independent state in their native highland after the fall of Bagratid Armenia, as it remained under foreign occupation. Following its conquest in 1045, and in the midst of Byzantine efforts to further repopulate the Empire&#x27;s east, Armenian immigration into Cilicia intensified and turned into a major socio-political movement. Armenians came to serve the Byzantines as military officers or governors, and were given control of important cities on the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s eastern frontier. The Seljuks also played a significant role in the Armenian population movement into Cilicia. In 1064, the Seljuk Turks led by Alp Arslan made their advance towards Anatolia by capturing Ani in Byzantine-held Armenia. Seven years later, they earned a decisive victory against Byzantium by defeating Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes&#x27; army at Manzikert, north of Lake Van. Alp Arslan&#x27;s successor, Malik-Shah I, further expanded the Seljuk Empire and levied repressive taxes on the Armenian inhabitants. After Catholicos Gregory II the Martyrophile&#x27;s assistant and representative, Parsegh of Cilicia&#x27;s solicitation, the Armenians obtained a partial reprieve, but Malik&#x27;s succeeding governors continued levying taxes. This led the Armenians to seek refuge in Byzantium and in Cilicia. Some Armenian leaders set themselves up as sovereign lords, while others remained, at least in name, loyal to the Empire. The most successful of these early Armenian warlords was Philaretos Brachamios, a former Byzantine general who was alongside Romanus Diogenes at Manzikert. Between 1078 and 1085, Philaretus built a principality stretching from Malatia in the north to Antioch in the south, and from Cilicia in the west to Edessa in the east. He invited many Armenian nobles to settle in his territory, and gave them land and castles. But Philaretus&#x27;s state began to crumble even before his death in 1090, and ultimately disintegrated into local lordships.

===The Rubenid dynasty===

====Emergence of Cilician Armenia====

One of the princes who came after Philaretos&#x27; invitation was Ruben, who had close ties with the last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. Ruben was alongside the Armenian ruler Gagik when he went to Constantinople upon the Byzantine emperor&#x27;s request. Instead of negotiating peace, however, the king was forced to cede his Armenian lands and live in exile. Gagik was later assassinated by Greeks. In 1080, soon after this assassination, Ruben organized a band of Armenian troops and revolted against the Byzantine Empire. He was joined by many other Armenian lords and nobles. Thus, in 1080, the foundations of the independent Armenian princedom of Cilicia, and the future kingdom, were laid under Ruben&#x27;s leadership. His descendants were called Rubenids (or &quot;Rubenians&quot;). After Ruben&#x27;s death in 1095, the Rubenid principality, centered around their fortresses, was led by Ruben&#x27;s son, Constantine I of Armenia; however, there were several other Armenian principalities both inside and beyond Cilicia, such as that of the Het&#x27;umids. This important Armenian dynasty was founded by the former Byzantine general Oshin, and was centered southwest of the Cilician Gates. The Het&#x27;umids contended with the Rubenids for power and influence over Cilicia. Various Armenian lords and former generals of Philaretos were also present in Marash, Malatia (Melitene), and Edessa, the latter two being located outside Cilicia.

====First Crusade====
During the reign of Constantine I, the First Crusade took place. An army of Western European Christians marched through Anatolia and Cilicia on their way to Jerusalem. The Armenians in Cilicia gained powerful allies among the Frankish Crusaders, whose leader, Godfrey of Bouillon, was considered a savior for the Armenians. Constantine saw the Crusaders&#x27; arrival as a one-time opportunity to consolidate his rule of Cilicia by eliminating the remaining Byzantine strongholds in the region. With the Crusaders&#x27; help, they secured Cilicia from the Byzantines and Turks, both by direct military actions in Cilicia and by establishing Crusader states in Antioch, Edessa, and Tripoli. The Armenians also helped the Crusaders; as described by Pope Gregory XIII in his &quot;&quot;:

To show their appreciation to their Armenian allies, the Crusaders honored Constantine with the titles of Comes and Baron. The friendly relationship between the Armenians and Crusaders was cemented by frequent intermarriages. For instance, Joscelin I of Edessa married the daughter of Constantine, and Baldwin, brother of Godfrey, married Constantine&#x27;s niece, daughter of his brother T&#x27;oros. The Armenians and Crusaders were part allies, part rivals for the two centuries to come. Often at the invitation of Armenian barons and kings the Crusaders maintained for varying periods castles in and along the borders of the Kingdom, including Bagras, Trapessac, T‛il Hamtun, Harunia, Selefkia, Amouda, and Sarvandikar.

====Armenian-Byzantine and Armenian-Seljuk contentions====
The son of Constantine was Thoros I, who succeeded him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and expanded the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, he took the castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge the death of the last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the closest thing to a ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.

Prince Levon I, T&#x27;oros&#x27; brother and successor, started his reign in 1129. He integrated the Cilician coastal cities to the Armenian principality, thus consolidating Armenian commercial leadership in the region. During this period, there was continued hostility between Cilician Armenia and the Seljuk Turks, as well as occasional bickering between Armenians and the Principality of Antioch over forts located near southern Amanus. In this context, in 1137, the Byzantines under Emperor John II, who still considered Cilicia to be a Byzantine province, conquered most of the towns and cities located on the Cilician plains. They captured and imprisoned Levon in Constantinople with several other family members, including his sons Ruben and T&#x27;oros. Levon died in prison three years later. Ruben was blinded and killed while in prison, but Levon&#x27;s second son and successor, Thoros II, escaped in 1141 and returned to Cilicia to lead the struggle with the Byzantines. Initially, he was successful in repelling Byzantine invasions; but, in 1158, he paid homage to Emperor Manuel I through a short-lived treaty. Around 1151, during T&#x27;oros&#x27; rule, the head of the Armenian Church transferred his see to Hromkla. Ruben II, Mleh, and Ruben III, succeeded T&#x27;oros in 1169, 1170, and 1175, respectively.

====Principality becomes a kingdom====

The Principality of Cilicia was a &quot;de facto&quot; kingdom before the ascension of Levon II. Levon II is considered the first king of Cilicia due to the Byzantine refusal of previous &quot;de facto&quot; kings as genuine &quot;de jure&quot; kings, rather than dukes.

Prince Levon II, one of Levon I&#x27;s grandsons and brother of Ruben III, acceded the throne in 1187. He fought the Seljuks of Iconium, Aleppo, and Damascus, and added new lands to Cilicia, doubling its Mediterranean coast. At the time, Saladin of Egypt defeated the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which led to the Third Crusade. Prince Levon II profited from the situation by improving relations with the Europeans. Cilician Armenia&#x27;s prominence in the region is attested by letters sent in 1189 by Pope Clement III to Levon and to Catholicos Gregory IV, in which he asks Armenian military and financial assistance to the crusaders. Thanks to the support given to Levon by the Holy Roman Emperors (Frederick Barbarossa, and his son, Henry VI), he elevated the princedom&#x27;s status to a kingdom. On January 6, 1198, the day Armenians celebrate Christmas, Prince Levon II was crowned with great solemnity in the cathedral of Tarsus, in the presence of the Syrian Jacobite patriarch, the Greek metropolitan of Tarsus, and numerous church dignitaries and military leaders. While he was crowned by the &quot;catholicos&quot;, Gregory VI Abirad, Levon received a banner with the insignia of a lion from Archbishop Conrad of Mainz in the name of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. By securing his crown, he became the first King of Armenian Cilicia as King Levon I. He became known as Levon the Magnificent, due to his numerous contributions to Cilician Armenian statehood in the political, military, and economic spheres. Levon&#x27;s growing power made him a particularly important ally for the neighbouring crusader state of Antioch, which resulted in intermarriage with noble families there, but his dynastic policies revealed ambition towards the overlordship of Antioch which the Latins ultimately could not countenance. They resulted in the Antiochene Wars of Succession between Levon&#x27;s grand-nephew Raymond Roupen and Bohemond IV of Antioch-Tripoli. The Rubenids consolidated their power by controlling strategic roads with fortifications that extended from the Taurus Mountains into the plain and along the borders, including the baronial and royal castles at Sis, Anavarza, Vahka, Vaner/Kovara, Sarvandikar, Kuklak, T‛il Hamtun, Hadjin, and Gaban (modern Geben).

In 1219, after a failed attempt by Raymond-Roupen to claim the throne, Levon&#x27;s daughter Zabel was proclaimed the new ruler of Cilician Armenia and placed under the regency of Adam of Baghras. Baghras was assassinated and the regency passed to Constantine of Baberon from the Het&#x27;umid dynasty, a very influential Armenian family. In order to fend off the Seljuk threat, Constantine sought an alliance with Bohemond IV of Antioch, and the marriage of Bohemond&#x27;s son Philip to Queen Zabel sealed this; however, Philip was too &quot;Latin&quot; for the Armenians&#x27; taste, as he refused to abide by the precepts of the Armenian Church. In 1224, Philip was imprisoned in Sis for stealing the crown jewels of Armenia, and after several months of confinement, he was poisoned and killed. Zabel decided to embrace a monastic life in the city of Seleucia, but she was later forced to marry Constantine&#x27;s son Het&#x27;um in 1226. Het&#x27;um became co-ruler as King Het&#x27;um I.

===The Het&#x27;umid dynasty===

By the 11th century the Het‘umids had settled into western Cilicia, primarily in the highlands of the Taurus Mountains. Their two great dynastic castles were Lampron and Papeŕōn/Baberon, which commanded strategic roads to the Cilician Gates and to Tarsus.

The apparent unification in marriage of the two main dynasties of Cilicia, Rubenid and Het&#x27;umid, ended a century of dynastic and territorial rivalry, while bringing the Het&#x27;umids to the forefront of political dominance in Cilician Armenia. Although the accession of Het&#x27;um I in 1226 marked the beginning of Cilician Armenia&#x27;s united dynastic kingdom, the Armenians were confronted by many challenges from abroad. In order to enact revenge for his son&#x27;s death, Bohemond sought an alliance with Seljuk sultan Kayqubad I, who captured regions west of Seleucia. Het&#x27;um also struck coins with his figure on one side, and with the name of the sultan on the other.

====Armeno-Mongol alliance and Mamluk threat====

During the rule of Zabel and Het&#x27;um, the Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successor Ögedei Khan rapidly expanded from Central Asia and reached the Middle East, conquering Mesopotamia and Syria in their advance towards Egypt. On June 26, 1243, they secured a decisive victory at Köse Dağ against the Seljuk Turks. The Mongol conquest was disastrous for Greater Armenia, but not Cilicia, as Het&#x27;um preemptively chose to cooperate with the Mongols. He sent his brother Smbat to the Mongol court of Karakorum in 1247 to negotiate an alliance. He returned in 1250 with an agreement guaranteeing the integrity of Cilicia, as well as the promise of Mongol aid to recapture forts seized by the Seljuks. Despite his sometimes-burdensome military commitments to the Mongols, Het’um had the financial resources and political autonomy to build new and impressive fortifications, such as the castle at Tamrut. In 1253, Het&#x27;um himself visited the new Mongol ruler Möngke Khan at Karakorum. He was received with great honors and promised freedom from taxation of the Armenian churches and monasteries located in Mongol territory. Both during his trip to the Mongol court and in his 1256 return to Cilicia, he passed through Greater Armenia. On his return voyage, he remained much longer, receiving visits from local princes, bishops, and abbots. Het&#x27;um and his forces fought under the Mongol banner of Hulagu in the conquest of Muslim Syria and the capture of Aleppo and Damascus from 1259 to 1260. The involvement of Het&#x27;um at these two conquests is debated however, with the source for such information - Templar of Tyre - claiming his involvement in a deliberate attempt to integrate Mongols into a Holy-War conquest narrative. This was to persuade Latin Christendom of the need for a war against the Mamluks. According to Arab historians, during Hulagu&#x27;s conquest of Aleppo, Het&#x27;um and his forces were responsible for a massacre and arsons in the main mosque and in the neighboring quarters and souks.

Meanwhile, the Egyptian Mamluks had been replacing their former Ayyubid masters in Egypt. The Mamluks began as a cavalry corps established from Turkic and other slaves sold to the Egyptian sultan by Genghis Khan. They took control of Egypt and Palestine in 1250 and 1253, respectively, and filled the vacuum caused by the Mongol destruction of the pre-existing Ayyubid and Abbasid governments. Cilician Armenia also expanded and recovered lands crossed by important trade routes on the Cappadocian, Mesopotamian, and Syrian borders, including Marash and Behesni, which further made the Armenian Kingdom a potential Mamluk target. Armenia also engaged in an economic battle with the Mamluks for control of the spice trade. The Mamluk leader Baibars took the field in 1266 with the intention of wiping out the Crusader states from the Middle East. In the same year, he summoned Het&#x27;um I to change his allegiance from the Mongols to the Mamluks, and remit to the Mamluks the territories and fortresses the Armenian king had acquired through his submission to the Mongols. After these threats, Het&#x27;um went to the Mongol court of the Il-Khan in Persia to obtain military support, but in his absence, the Mamluks invaded Cilician Armenia. Het&#x27;um&#x27;s sons T&#x27;oros and Levon were left to defend the country. During the Disaster of Mari, the Mamluks under Sultan Al-Mansur Ali and the commander Qalawun overran the heavily outnumbered Armenians, killing T&#x27;oros and capturing Levon. Afterwards the capital of Sis was sacked and burnt, thousands of Armenians were massacred and 40,000 taken captive. Het&#x27;um ransomed Levon for a high price, giving the Mamluks control of many fortresses and a large sum of money. The 1269 Cilicia earthquake further devastated the country.

In 1269, Het&#x27;um I abdicated in favour of his son Levon II, who paid large annual tributes to the Mamluks. Even with the tributes, the Mamluks continued to attack Cilicia every few years. In 1275, an army led by the emirs of the sultan invaded the country without pretext and faced Armenians who had no means of resistance. The city of Tarsus was taken, the royal palace and the church of Saint Sophia was burned, the state treasury was looted, 15,000 civilians were killed, and 10,000 were taken captive to Egypt. Almost the entire population of Ayas, Armenian, and Frankish perished.

====Truce with Mamluks (1281–1295)====

In 1281, following the defeat of the Mongols and the Armenians under Möngke Temur by the Mamluks at the Second Battle of Homs, a truce was forced on Armenia. Further, in 1285, following a powerful offensive push by Qalawun, the Armenians had to sign a ten-year truce under harsh terms. The Armenians were obligated to cede many fortresses to the Mamluks and were prohibited to rebuild their defensive fortifications. Cilician Armenia was forced to trade with Egypt, thereby circumventing a trade embargo imposed by the pope. Moreover, the Mamluks were to receive an annual tribute of one million dirhams from the Armenians. The Mamluks, despite the above, continued to raid Cilician Armenia on numerous occasions. In 1292, it was invaded by Al-Ashraf Khalil, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, who had conquered the remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Acre the year before. Hromkla was also sacked, forcing the Catholicossate to move to Sis. Het&#x27;um was forced to abandon Behesni, Marash, and Tel Hamdoun to the Turks. In 1293, he abdicated in favor of his brother T&#x27;oros III, and entered the monastery of Mamistra.

====Campaigns with Mongols (1299–1303)====

In the summer of 1299, Het&#x27;um I&#x27;s grandson, King Het&#x27;um II, again facing threats of attack by the Mamluks, asked the Mongol khan of Persia, Ghâzân, for his support. In response, Ghâzân marched towards Syria and invited the Franks of Cyprus (the King of Cyprus, the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Teutonic Knights), to join his attack on the Mamluks. The Mongols took the city of Aleppo, where they were joined by King Het&#x27;um. His forces included Templars and Hospitallers from the kingdom of Armenia, who participated in the rest of the offensive. The combined force defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, on December 23, 1299. The bulk of the Mongol army was then obligated to retreat. In their absence, the Mamluks regrouped, and regained the area in May 1300.

In 1303, the Mongols tried to conquer Syria once again in larger numbers (approximately 80,000) along with the Armenians, but they were defeated at Homs on March 30, 1303, and during the decisive Battle of Shaqhab, south of Damascus, on April 21, 1303. It is considered to be the last major Mongol invasion of Syria. When Ghazan died on May 10, 1304, all hope of reconquest of the Holy Land died in conjunction.

Het&#x27;um II abdicated in favour of his sixteen-year-old nephew Levon III and became a Franciscan friar; however, he emerged from his monastic cell to help Levon defend Cilicia from a Mamluk army, which was thus defeated near Baghras. In 1307, both the current and former kings met with Bularghu, the Mongol representative in Cilicia, at his camp just outside Anazarba. Bularghu, a recent convert to Islam, murdered the entire Armenian party. Oshin, brother of Het&#x27;um, immediately marched against Bularghu to retaliate and vanquished him, forcing him to leave Cilicia. Bulargu was executed by Oljeitu for his crime at the request of the Armenians. Oshin was crowned new king of Cilician Armenia upon his return to Tarsus.

The Het&#x27;umids continued ruling an unstable Cilicia until the assassination of Levon IV in 1341, at the hands of an angry mob. Levon IV formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Cyprus, then ruled by the Frankish Lusignan dynasty, but could not resist attacks from the Mamluks.

===Demise of Cilician Armenia===

====Decline and fall with the Lusignan dynasty====
There had always been close relations between the Armenians and the Lusignans, who, by the 12th century, were already established in the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Had it not been for their presence in Cyprus, the kingdom of Cilician Armenia may have, out of necessity, established itself on the island. In 1342, Levon&#x27;s cousin Guy de Lusignan, was anointed king as Constantine II, King of Armenia. Guy de Lusignan and his younger brother John were considered pro-Latin and deeply committed to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church in the Levant. As kings, the Lusignans attempted to impose Catholicism and the European ways. The Armenian nobles largely accepted this, but the peasantry opposed the changes, which eventually led to civil strife.

From 1343 to 1344, a time when the Armenian population and its feudal rulers refused to adapt to the new Lusignan leadership and its policy of Latinizing the Armenian Church, Cilicia was again invaded by the Mamluks, who were intent on territorial expansion. Frequent appeals for help and support were made by the Armenians to their co-religionists in Europe, and the kingdom was also involved in planning new crusades. Amidst failed Armenian pleas for help from Europe, the fall of Sis to the Mamluks, followed by the fortress of Gaban in 1375, where King Levon V, his daughter Marie, and her husband Shahan had taken refuge, put an end to the kingdom. The final king, Levon V, was granted safe passage and arrived in Castille seeking assistance from the King John I of Castile to recover his kingdom. While in Castille, he was granted the title of Lord of Madrid and other cities. He left Castille for France at the death of John I and died in exile in Paris in 1393, after having called in vain for another crusade. In 1396, Levon&#x27;s title and privileges were transferred to James I, his cousin and king of Cyprus. The title of King of Armenia was thus united with the titles of King of Cyprus and King of Jerusalem. The title has also been claimed indirectly by the House of Savoy by claiming the title King of Jerusalem and a number of other thrones.

====Dispersion of the Armenian population of Cilicia====
Although the Mamluks had taken over Cilicia, they were unable to hold it. Turkic tribes settled there, leading to the conquest of Cilicia led by Timur. As a result, 30,000 wealthy Armenians left Cilicia and settled in Cyprus, still ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489. Many merchant families also fled westward and founded or joined with existing diaspora communities in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. Only the humbler Armenians remained in Cilicia. They nevertheless maintained their foothold in the region throughout Turkic rule.

In the 16th century, Cilicia fell under Ottoman dominion and officially became known as the Adana Vilayet in the 17th century. Cilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians, because it managed to preserve Armenian character well throughout the years. In 1909, Cilician Armenians were massacred in Adana. Descendants of the remaining Cilician Armenians have been dispersed in the Armenian diaspora, and the Holy See of Cilicia is based in Antelias, Lebanon. The lion, emblem of the Cilician Armenian state, remains a symbol of Armenian statehood to this day, featured on the Coat of arms of Armenia.

==Cilician Armenian society==

===Culture===

Demographically, Cilician Armenia was heterogeneous with a population of Armenians who constituted the ruling class, and also Greeks, Jews, Muslims, and various Europeans. The multi-ethnic population, as well as commercial and political links with Europeans, particularly France, brought important new influences on Armenian culture. The Cilician nobility adopted many aspects of Western European life, including chivalry, fashion, and the use of French Christian names. The structure of Cilician society became more synonymous with Western feudalism than to the traditional &quot;nakharar&quot; system of Armenia. In fact, during the Cilician period, Western titles such as &quot;baron&quot; and &quot;constable&quot; replaced their Armenian equivalents &quot;nakharar&quot; and &quot;sparapet&quot;. European tradition was adopted for the knighting of Armenian nobles, while jousts and tournaments similar to those in Europe had become popular in Cilician Armenia. The extent of Western influence over Cilician Armenia is also reflected by the incorporation of two new letters (Ֆ ֆ = &quot;f&quot; and Օ օ = &quot;o&quot;) and various Latin-based words into the Armenian language.

In other areas, there was more hostility to the new Western trends. Above all, most ordinary Armenians frowned on conversion to Roman Catholicism or Greek Orthodoxy. Cultural influence was not merely one-way, however; Cilician Armenians had an important impact on Crusaders returning to the West, most notably with their architectural traditions. Europeans incorporated elements of Armenian castle-building, learned from Armenian masons in the Crusader states, as well as some elements of church architecture. Most Armenian castles made atypical usage of rocky heights, and featured curved walls and round towers, similar to those of the Hospitaller castles Krak des Chevaliers and Marqab. The Cilician period also produced some important examples of Armenian art, notably the illuminated manuscripts of Toros Roslin, who was at work in Hromkla in the thirteenth century.

===Economy===

Cilician Armenia had become a prosperous state due to its strategic position on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. It was located at the juncture of many trade routes linking Central Asia and the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The kingdom was thus important in the spice trade, as well as livestock, hides, wool, and cotton. In addition, important products such as timber, grain, wine, raisins, and raw silk were also exported from the country and finished cloth and metal products from the West were made available.

During the reign of King Levon, the economy of Cilician Armenia progressed greatly and became heavily integrated with Western Europe. He secured agreements with Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, as well as the French and the Catalans, and granted them certain privileges such as tax exemptions in return for their business. The three primary harbours of the Armenian Kingdom, which were vital to its economy and defense, were the fortified coastal sites at Ayas and Korikos, and the river emporium of Mopsuestia. The latter, situated on two strategic caravan routes, was the last fully navigable port to the Mediterranean on the Pyramus River and the location of warehouses licensed by the Armenians to the Genoese. Important European merchant communities and colonies came into existence, with their own churches, courts of law, and trading houses. As French became the secondary language of Cilician nobility, the secondary language for Cilician commerce had become Italian due to the three Italian city-states&#x27; extensive involvement in the Cilician economy. Marco Polo, for example, set out on his journey to China from Ayas in 1271.

In the thirteenth century, under the rule of Toros, Cilician Armenia already struck its own coins. Gold and silver coins, called &quot;dram&quot; and &quot;tagvorin&quot;, were struck at the royal mints of Sis and Tarsus. Foreign coins such as the Italian &quot;ducat&quot;, &quot;florin&quot;, and &quot;zecchino&quot;, the Greek &quot;besant&quot;, the Arab &quot;dirham&quot;, and the French &quot;livre&quot; were also accepted by merchants.

===Religion===
The Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church followed its people in taking refuge outside the Armenian highlands, which had turned into a battleground of Byzantine and Seljuk contenders. Its seat was first transferred to Sebasteia in 1058 in Cappadocia, where had existed a significant Armenian population. Later, it moved to various locations in Cilicia; Tavbloor in 1062; Dzamendav in 1066; Dzovk in 1116; and Hromkla in 1149. During King Levon I&#x27;s rule, the Catholicos was located in distant Hromkla. He was assisted by fourteen bishops in administering the Armenian Church in the kingdom, a number which grew in later years. The archbishops&#x27; seats were located in Tarsus, Sis, Anazarba, Lambron, and Mamistra. There existed up to sixty monastic houses in Cilicia, although the exact locations of the majority of them remain unclear.

In 1198, the Catholicos of Sis, Grigor VI Apirat, proclaimed a union between the Armenian Church and the Roman Catholic Church; however, this had no notable effect, as the local clergy and populace was strongly opposed to such a union. The Western Church sent numerous missions to Cilician Armenia to help with rapprochement, but had limited results. The Franciscans were put in charge of this activity. John of Monte Corvino himself arrived in Cilician Armenia in 1288.

Het&#x27;um II became a Franciscan friar after his abdication. The Armenian historian Nerses Balients was a Franciscan and an advocate of union with the Latin Church. The papal claim of primacy did not contribute positively to the efforts for unity between the Churches. Mkhitar Skewratsi, the Armenian delegate at the council in Acre in 1261, summed the Armenian frustration in these words:

After the sacking of Hromkla by the Mamluks in 1293, the Catholicosate was transferred to Sis, the capital of the Cilician Kingdom. Again, in 1441, long after the fall of the kingdom, the Armenian Catholicos of Sis, Grigor IX Musabekiants, proclaimed the union of the Armenian and Latin churches at the Council of Florence; this was countered by an Armenian schism under Kirakos I Virapetsi, who moved the See of the Catholicos to Echmiadzin, and marginalized Sis.

<text>The Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress (&#x27;All Orissa Tribal Congress&#x27;) was a tribal political movemenent in the Indian state of Orissa. It was launched on the initiative of leaders of the Indian National Congress in Orissa, who wanted to counter-mobilize against the territorial claims of the Jharkhand Party on the Orissa tribal belt. The organization was founded by Lal Ranjit Singh Bariha in late 1950. Bariha, Tribal Welfare Minister in the pre-1952 Orissa state government, was accompanied by other ministers in building the organization in the Orissa tribal belt. The Abibasi Mahasabha led by Sonaram Soren merged into the Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress. In 1951 the Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress was able to counter the Jharkhand movement in Orissa, leading to the marginalization of the latter in Orissa politics. In September 1951 Sonaram Soren was named Acting President of Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress.

The organization contested the 1952 elections in alliance with the Indian National Congress. The Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress won five seats in the 1952 Orissa Legislative Assembly election. Sonaram Soren was one of the elected legislators and was named became Minister of Tribal and Rural Welfare, Labour and Commerce in the state government. The Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress supported the Congress government during its 1952-1957 tenure. Its legislators later joined the Orissa Congress Legislative Party. T. Sanganna, the Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress Vice President and who had been elected from the Rayagada-Phulbani seat in the 1952 Indian general election, formed a one-member parliamentary faction of Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress in the Lok Sabha. Moreover, Sibnarayan Singh Mahapatra, who was elected as a Member of Parliament from Sundargarh, served as the treasurer of the Nikhil Utkal Adivasi Congress and President of one of its district units from April 1951. Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Sunder Mohun Hemrom was a member of the organization from 1950 onwards.

The organization again contested the 1957 elections.

<text>Terence Chi-Shen Tao (; born 17 July 1975) is an Australian-American mathematician, Fields medalist, and professor of mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he holds the James and Carol Collins Chair in the College of Letters and Sciences. His research includes topics in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic combinatorics, arithmetic combinatorics, geometric combinatorics, probability theory, compressed sensing and analytic number theory.

Tao was born to Chinese immigrant parents and raised in Adelaide. Tao won the Fields Medal in 2006 and won the Royal Medal and Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014, and is a 2006 MacArthur Fellow. Tao has been the author or co-author of over three hundred research papers, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest living mathematicians.

==Life and career==
===Family===
Tao&#x27;s parents are first generation immigrants from Hong Kong to Australia. Tao&#x27;s father, Billy Tao, was a Chinese paediatrician who was born in Shanghai and earned his medical degree (MBBS) from the University of Hong Kong in 1969. Tao&#x27;s mother, Grace Leong, was born in Hong Kong; she received a first-class honours degree in mathematics and physics at the University of Hong Kong. She was a secondary school teacher of mathematics and physics in Hong Kong. Billy and Grace met as students at the University of Hong Kong. They then emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia in 1972.

Tao also has two brothers, Trevor and Nigel, who are currently living in Australia. Both formerly represented Australia at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Furthermore, Trevor Tao has been representing Australia internationally in chess and holds the title of Chess International Master. 

Tao speaks Cantonese but cannot write Chinese. Tao is married to Laura Tao, an electrical engineer at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They live in Los Angeles, California, and have two children.

===Childhood===
A child prodigy, Terence Tao skipped 5 grades. Tao exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age, attending university-level mathematics courses at the age of 9. He is one of only three children in the history of the Johns Hopkins Study of Exceptional Talent program to have achieved a score of 700 or greater on the SAT math section while just eight years old; Tao scored a 760. Julian Stanley, Director of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, stated that Tao had the greatest mathematical reasoning ability he had found in years of intensive searching.

Tao was the youngest participant to date in the International Mathematical Olympiad, first competing at the age of ten; in 1986, 1987, and 1988, he won a bronze, silver, and gold medal, respectively. Tao remains the youngest winner of each of the three medals in the Olympiad&#x27;s history, having won the gold medal at the age of 13 in 1988.

===Career===
At age 14, Tao attended the Research Science Institute, a summer program for secondary students. In 1991, he received his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees at the age of 16 from Flinders University under the direction of Garth Gaudry. In 1992, he won a postgraduate Fulbright Scholarship to undertake research in mathematics at Princeton University in the United States. From 1992 to 1996, Tao was a graduate student at Princeton University under the direction of Elias Stein, receiving his PhD at the age of 21. In 1996, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1999, when he was 24, he was promoted to full professor at UCLA and remains the youngest person ever appointed to that rank by the institution.

He is known for his collaborative mindset; by 2006, Tao had worked with over 30 others in his discoveries, reaching 68 co-authors by October 2015.

Tao has had a particularly extensive collaboration with British mathematician Ben J. Green; together they proved the Green–Tao theorem, which is well known among both amateur and professional mathematicians. This theorem states that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it this way:

Many other results of Tao have received mainstream attention in the scientific press, including:
* his establishment of finite time blowup for a modification of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness Millennium Problem
* his 2015 resolution of the Erdős discrepancy problem, which used entropy estimates within analytic number theory
* his 2019 progress on the Collatz conjecture, in which he proved the probabilistic claim that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values.
Tao has also resolved or made progress on a number of conjectures. In 2012, Green and Tao announced proofs of the conjectured &quot;orchard-planting problem,&quot; which asks for the maximum number of lines through exactly 3 points in a set of n points in the plane, not all on a line. In 2018, with Brad Rodgers, Tao showed that the de Bruijn–Newman constant, the nonpositivity of which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, is nonnegative. In 2020, Tao proved Sendov&#x27;s conjecture, concerning the locations of the roots and critical points of a complex polynomial, in the special case of polynomials with sufficiently high degree.

===Recognition===
Tao has won numerous mathematician honours and awards over the years. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Australian Academy of Science (Corresponding Member), the National Academy of Sciences (Foreign member), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Mathematical Society. In 2006 he received the Fields Medal; he was the first Australian, the first UCLA faculty member, and one of the youngest mathematicians to receive the award. He was also awarded the MacArthur Fellowship. He has been featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, CNN, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Popular Science&quot;, and many other media outlets. In 2014, Tao received a CTY Distinguished Alumni Honor from Johns Hopkins Center for Gifted and Talented Youth in front of 979 attendees in 8th and 9th grade that are in the same program from which Tao graduated. In 2021, President Joe Biden announced Tao had been selected as one of 30 members of his President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a body bringing together America&#x27;s most distinguished leaders in science and technology. In 2021, Tao was awarded the Riemann Prize Week as recipient of the inaugural Riemann Prize 2019 by the Riemann International School of Mathematics at the University of Insubria. Tao was a finalist to become Australian of the Year in 2007.

As of 2022, Tao had published over three hundred articles, along with sixteen books. He has an Erdős number of 2. He is a highly cited researcher.

An article by &quot;New Scientist&quot; writes of his ability:

British mathematician and Fields medalist Timothy Gowers remarked on Tao&#x27;s breadth of knowledge:

==Research contributions==
===Dispersive partial differential equations===
From 2001 to 2010, Tao was part of a collaboration with James Colliander, Markus Keel, Gigliola Staffilani, and Hideo Takaoka. They found a number of novel results, many to do with the well-posedness of weak solutions, for Schrödinger equations, KdV equations, and KdV-type equations.Michael Christ, Colliander, and Tao developed methods of Carlos Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega to establish ill-posedness of certain Schrödinger and KdV equations for Sobolev data of sufficiently low exponents. In many cases these results were sharp enough to perfectly complement well-posedness results for sufficiently large exponents as due to Bourgain, Colliander−Keel−Staffilani−Takaoka−Tao, and others. Further such notable results for Schrödinger equations were found by Tao in collaboration with Ioan Bejenaru.

A particularly notable result of the Colliander−Keel−Staffilani−Takaoka−Tao collaboration established the long-time existence and scattering theory of a power-law Schrödinger equation in three dimensions. Their methods, which made use of the scale-invariance of the simple power law, were extended by Tao in collaboration with Monica Vișan and Xiaoyi Zhang to deal with nonlinearities in which the scale-invariance is broken. Rowan Killip, Tao, and Vișan later made notable progress on the two-dimensional problem in radial symmetry.

An article by Tao in 2001 considered the wave maps equation with two-dimensional domain and spherical range. He built upon earlier innovations of Daniel Tataru, who considered wave maps valued in Minkowski space. Tao proved the global well-posedness of solutions with sufficiently small initial data. The fundamental difficulty is that Tao considers smallness relative to the critical Sobolev norm, which typically requires sophisticated techniques. Tao later adapted some of his work on wave maps to the setting of the Benjamin–Ono equation; Alexandru Ionescu and Kenig later obtained improved results with Tao&#x27;s methods.

In 2016, Tao constructed a variant of the Navier–Stokes equations which possess solutions exhibiting irregular behavior in finite time. Due to structural similarities between Tao&#x27;s system and the Navier–Stokes equations themselves, it follows that any positive resolution of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem must take into account the specific nonlinear structure of the equations. In particular, certain previously proposed resolutions of the problem could not be legitimate. Tao speculated that the Navier–Stokes equations might be able to simulate a Turing complete system, and that as a consequence it might be possible to (negatively) resolve the existence and smoothness problem using a modification of his results. However, such results remain (as of 2024) conjectural.

===Harmonic analysis===
Bent Fuglede introduced the Fuglede conjecture in the 1970s, positing a tile-based characterisation of those Euclidean domains for which a Fourier ensemble provides a basis of Tao resolved the conjecture in the negative for dimensions larger than 5, based upon the construction of an elementary counterexample to an analogous problem in the setting of finite groups.

With Camil Muscalu and Christoph Thiele, Tao considered certain multilinear singular integral operators with the multiplier allowed to degenerate on a hyperplane, identifying conditions which ensure operator continuity relative to spaces. This unified and extended earlier notable results of Ronald Coifman, Carlos Kenig, Michael Lacey, Yves Meyer, Elias Stein, and Thiele, among others. Similar problems were analysed by Tao in 2001 in the context of Bourgain spaces, rather than the usual spaces. Such estimates are used in establishing well-posedness results for dispersive partial differential equations, following famous earlier work of Jean Bourgain, Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega, among others.

A number of Tao&#x27;s results deal with &quot;restriction&quot; phenomena in Fourier analysis, which have been widely studied since the time of the articles of Charles Fefferman, Robert Strichartz, and Peter Tomas in the 1970s. Here one studies the operation which restricts input functions on Euclidean space to a submanifold and outputs the product of the Fourier transforms of the corresponding measures. It is of major interest to identify exponents such that this operation is continuous relative to spaces. Such multilinear problems originated in the 1990s, including in notable work of Jean Bourgain, Sergiu Klainerman, and Matei Machedon. In collaboration with Ana Vargas and Luis Vega, Tao made some foundational contributions to the study of the bilinear restriction problem, establishing new exponents and drawing connections to the linear restriction problem. They also found analogous results for the bilinear Kakeya problem which is based upon the X-ray transform instead of the Fourier transform. In 2003, Tao adapted ideas developed by Thomas Wolff for bilinear restriction to conical sets into the setting of restriction to quadratic hypersurfaces. The multilinear setting for these problems was further developed by Tao in collaboration with Jonathan Bennett and Anthony Carbery; their work was extensively used by Bourgain and Larry Guth in deriving estimates for general oscillatory integral operators.

===Compressed sensing and statistics===
In collaboration with Emmanuel Candes and Justin Romberg, Tao has made notable contributions to the field of compressed sensing. In mathematical terms, most of their results identify settings in which a convex optimisation problem correctly computes the solution of an optimisation problem which seems to lack a computationally tractable structure. These problems are of the nature of finding the solution of an underdetermined linear system with the minimal possible number of nonzero entries, referred to as &quot;sparsity&quot;. Around the same time, David Donoho considered similar problems from the alternative perspective of high-dimensional geometry.

Motivated by striking numerical experiments, Candes, Romberg, and Tao first studied the case where the matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform. Candes and Tao abstracted the problem and introduced the notion of a &quot;restricted linear isometry,&quot; which is a matrix that is quantitatively close to an isometry when restricted to certain subspaces. They showed that it is sufficient for either exact or optimally approximate recovery of sufficiently sparse solutions. Their proofs, which involved the theory of convex duality, were markedly simplified in collaboration with Romberg, to use only linear algebra and elementary ideas of harmonic analysis. These ideas and results were later improved by Candes. Candes and Tao also considered relaxations of the sparsity condition, such as power-law decay of coefficients. They complemented these results by drawing on a large corpus of past results in random matrix theory to show that, according to the Gaussian ensemble, a large number of matrices satisfy the restricted isometry property.

In 2007, Candes and Tao introduced a novel statistical estimator for linear regression, which they called the &quot;Dantzig selector.&quot; They proved a number of results on its success as an estimator and model selector, roughly in parallel to their earlier work on compressed sensing. A number of other authors have since studied the Dantzig selector, comparing it to similar objects such as the statistical lasso introduced in the 1990s. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome H. Friedman conclude that it is &quot;somewhat unsatisfactory&quot; in a number of cases. Nonetheless, it remains of significant interest in the statistical literature.

In 2009, Candes and Benjamin Recht considered an analogous problem for recovering a matrix from knowledge of only a few of its entries and the information that the matrix is of low rank. They formulated the problem in terms of convex optimisation, studying minimisation of the nuclear norm. Candes and Tao, in 2010, developed further results and techniques for the same problem. Improved results were later found by Recht. Similar problems and results have also been considered by a number of other authors.

===Random matrices===
In the 1950s, Eugene Wigner initiated the study of random matrices and their eigenvalues. Wigner studied the case of hermitian and symmetric matrices, proving a &quot;semicircle law&quot; for their eigenvalues. In 2010, Tao and Van Vu made a major contribution to the study of non-symmetric random matrices. They showed that if is large and the entries of a matrix are selected randomly according to any fixed probability distribution of expectation 0 and standard deviation 1, then the eigenvalues of will tend to be uniformly scattered across the disk of radius around the origin; this can be made precise using the language of measure theory. This gave a proof of the long-conjectured circular law, which had previously been proved in weaker formulations by many other authors. In Tao and Vu&#x27;s formulation, the circular law becomes an immediate consequence of a &quot;universality principle&quot; stating that the distribution of the eigenvalues can depend only on the average and standard deviation of the given component-by-component probability distribution, thereby providing a reduction of the general circular law to a calculation for specially-chosen probability distributions.

In 2011, Tao and Vu established a &quot;four moment theorem&quot;, which applies to random hermitian matrices whose components are independently distributed, each with average 0 and standard deviation 1, and which are exponentially unlikely to be large (as for a Gaussian distribution). If one considers two such random matrices which agree on the average value of any quadratic polynomial in the diagonal entries and on the average value of any quartic polynomial in the off-diagonal entries, then Tao and Vu show that the expected value of a large number of functions of the eigenvalues will also coincide, up to an error which is uniformly controllable by the size of the matrix and which becomes arbitrarily small as the size of the matrix increases. Similar results were obtained around the same time by László Erdös, Horng-Tzer Yau, and Jun Yin.

===Analytic number theory and arithmetic combinatorics===

In 2004, Tao, together with Jean Bourgain and Nets Katz, studied the additive and multiplicative structure of subsets of finite fields of prime order. It is well known that there are no nontrivial subrings of such a field. Bourgain, Katz, and Tao provided a quantitative formulation of this fact, showing that for any subset of such a field, the number of sums and products of elements of the subset must be quantitatively large, as compared to the size of the field and the size of the subset itself. Improvements of their result were later given by Bourgain, Alexey Glibichuk, and Sergei Konyagin.

Tao and Ben Green proved the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers; this result is generally referred to as the Green–Tao theorem, and is among Tao&#x27;s most well-known results. The source of Green and Tao&#x27;s arithmetic progressions is Endre Szemerédi&#x27;s 1975 theorem on existence of arithmetic progressions in certain sets of integers. Green and Tao showed that one can use a &quot;transference principle&quot; to extend the validity of Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem to further sets of integers. The Green–Tao theorem then arises as a special case, although it is not trivial to show that the prime numbers satisfy the conditions of Green and Tao&#x27;s extension of the Szemerédi theorem.

In 2010, Green and Tao gave a multilinear extension of Dirichlet&#x27;s celebrated theorem on arithmetic progressions. Given a matrix and a matrix whose components are all integers, Green and Tao give conditions on when there exist infinitely many matrices such that all components of are prime numbers. The proof of Green and Tao was incomplete, as it was conditioned upon unproven conjectures. Those conjectures were proved in later work of Green, Tao, and Tamar Ziegler.

<doc id="1118521" wikidata="Q4963565" url="?curid=1118521" title="Brian Dewan">
<text>Brian Dewan (born 14 June 1963) is an American multi-media artist, who produces music, audio-visual performances, decorative painting, furniture, poetry, filmstrips, illustrations, and musical instruments. He has released three albums of songs and performed extensively in clubs and concert halls as a solo artist and as a member of various ensembles. He lives in Catskill, New York. Brian is the brother of artist Ted Dewan and the cousin of musical instrument builder/musician Leon Dewan.

== Music ==
Dewan has a cross-genre approach to music, although he is predominantly known for his folk-tinged vocal stylings and instrumental electronic music, which on a performance level are generally mutually exclusive. His vocal repertoire references folk music, hymns, popular songs from bygone eras (especially topical songs from the 19th and early 20th centuries), and rock music. He also composes original songs reflecting these influences. These genres permeate his first two full-length albums, &quot;Brian Dewan Tells the Story&quot; (1993, Bar None Records) and &quot;The Operating Theatre&quot; (1998, Instinct Records). His songs often contemplate the nature of submission to authority, often in a storytelling manner. His lyrics are by turns humorous, philosophical, and contemplative. His historical song repertoire often betrays a post-modern irony in the re-telling.

In live performance, Dewan accompanies his singing with a home-built electric zither, outfitted with eight humbucker pickups and 88 strings, sometimes piped through a leslie cabinet or guitar effects pedals. He also plays a variety of other instruments, including autoharp, koto, organ, and accordion. His electronic music, either solo or in collaboration with his cousin, Leon Dewan, tends to be more sprawling and free-form, often evoking the dissonance of early analog electronic music.

Dewan has worked with They Might Be Giants, Sesame Street, Flaming Fire, Jed Davis, The Music Tapes, Loser&#x27;s Lounge, The Shondes and The Musical Stones of Skiddaw. He is a member of the Raymond Scott Orchestrette, a group dedicated to reinterpreting Scott&#x27;s compositions, and appeared on their 2002 album &quot;Pushbutton Parfait&quot;. He also composes and performs with the Patient Island Singers, a project loosely centered around the topic of Roosevelt Island. He was an original member of the Blue Man Group &quot;Tubes&quot; house band, for whom he composed musical scores. He later sued the group for authorship claims, and eventually prevailed in court.

Dewan&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Words Of Wisdom&quot; (Eschatone Records) was the first in a series of folk archival recordings called the Humanitarium Series. Each record in the series will collect a set of song artifacts by theme: temperance, school songs, hymns, folksongs ancient and modern, institutional music, advertisement and persuasion, ditties, jingles, and popular music.

He has also performed a song for the original soundtrack CD for the &quot;Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?&quot; television series, though this track was commissioned for the CD and never used in any other context.

== Visual and multi-media art ==
Brian Dewan&#x27;s series of &quot;I Can See&quot; filmstrips use the technology of the educational filmstrips from the mid-twentieth century as a point of departure for imaginative personal invention.

Each panel features one of Dewan&#x27;s fanciful drawings, usually skillfully rendered in magic marker or watercolor. The images are accompanied by elaborate soundtracks in which Dewan is heard, adopting a deadpan narrator&#x27;s voice, and playing various musical instruments to create a different miniature soundtrack for each panel of the filmstrip. When it is time for the projectionist to advance the strip to the next panel, Dewan&#x27;s voice is typically heard singing &quot;boop&quot; in close imitation of the noise traditionally used for this purpose. The themes of the strips often seem as though they could have been taken from actual educational strips - &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot;, Civic Pride, a short history of the Organ, Biblical stories have all served as conceits for the filmstrips. The strips tend to take many free-associative liberties and are by turns satirical and surreal, often whimsical and sometimes touching on serious themes. &quot;Before the White Man Came&quot; seems as though it might be about colonialism or racism, but the &quot;White Man&quot; of the filmstrip starts to seem more likely to be a folkloric evil spirit, with a charged and ambiguous relationship to racial stereotypes.

In 2003, Dewan created an installation at the Pierogi 2000 Gallery in Brooklyn which transformed the appearance of the gallery into that of an American classroom from an indeterminate bygone era, perhaps from the 1940s. He presented his filmstrips regularly during the course of the month-long exhibition, to audience members seated in old schooldesks.

Dewan has created a series of what he terms &quot;shrines&quot;, constructed of wood and other materials, such as light bulbs, clocks, photographs and bottles. Perhaps the best known shrine is the one appearing on the cover of They Might Be Giants&#x27; album &quot;Lincoln&quot;. The shrines range from about one to six feet tall and often evoke New England church architecture with their lean geometrical spires. While the word &quot;shrine&quot; might connote a site created for devotion to a spiritual entity, Dewan&#x27;s shrines seem to exist not as a conduit for worship, but as playful aesthetic objects.

Dewan created a number of shrines for New Year&#x27;s Eve parties and performances, and those shrines often have some sort of illumination which could be turned on at midnight. At least one had a drink-dispenser built into it. The cabinetry he built for his recent series of electronic instruments, created in collaboration with his cousin, Leon Dewan, often continue some of the visual ideas behind the shrines. His New Year&#x27;s Eve shrine ritual involves completing the shrine only moments before midnight.

Brian Dewan currently works with his cousin Leon Dewan under the name Dewanatron. Together they have designed and built a series of synthesizers in custom cabinetry, often reminiscent of either New England churches or 1940&#x27;s school house architecture. The instruments create sounds evocative of the early electronic music. The instruments were exhibited and concertized at the Pierogi 2000 gallery in Brooklyn in December 2005, Pierogi Liepig in Germany in April 2006 and at &quot;Another Year in LA&quot; gallery as well as the Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles in August and September 2007.

Dewan has created album art for others, such as the cover of David Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Uh-Oh&quot;, They Might Be Giants&#x27; &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Beat Circus&#x27; &quot;Dreamland&quot;, and the interior artwork of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; by Neutral Milk Hotel.

<text>Squid was a British World War II ship-mounted anti-submarine weapon. It consisted of a three-barrelled mortar which launched depth charges. It replaced the Hedgehog system, and was in turn replaced by the Limbo system.

== Development ==
Ordered directly from the drawing board in 1942, under the auspices of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development, this weapon was rushed into service in May 1943 on board HMS &quot;Ambuscade&quot;. The first production unit was installed on HMS &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot;; it went on to be installed on 70 frigates and corvettes during the Second World War. The first successful use was by HMS &quot;Loch Killin&quot; on 31 July 1944, when she sank . The system was credited with sinking 17 submarines in 50 attacks over the course of the war - a success ratio of 2.9 to 1. In contrast, out of 5,174 British depth charge attacks in WWII there were 85.5 kills, a ratio of 60.5 to 1. The Hedgehog made 268 attacks for 47 kills, a ratio of 5.7 to 1. By 1959, 195 Squid installations had been produced.

This weapon was a three-barrel mortar with the mortars mounted in series but off-bore from each other in order to scatter the projectiles. The barrels were mounted in a frame that could be rotated through 90 degrees for loading. The projectiles weighed with a minol charge. On some vessels, the Squid installations were at the stern – the bombs were fired over the length of the ship and dropped into the sea slightly ahead of it. Sink rate was 43.5 ft/s (13.3 m/s) and a clockwork time fuze was used to determine the detonation depth. All three projectiles had to be set to the same depth; this could be continuously updated right up to the moment of launch to take into account the movements of the target. The maximum depth was .

The weapons were automatically fired from the sonar range recorder at the proper moment. The pattern formed a triangle about on a side at a distance of ahead of the ship. Most Squid installations utilised two sets of mortars. All six bombs were fired in salvo so they formed opposing triangular spreads. The salvos were set to explode above and below the target, the resulting pressure wave crushing the hull of the submarine. Post-war trials found Squid was nine times more effective than conventional depth charges.

== Use ==
Despite its proven effectiveness, some officers, notably Captain Kenneth Adams, RCN, opposed fitting Squid to escorts because it meant sacrificing guns, which would make ships unsuitable for fleet actions.

In April 1977, the Type 61 frigate &quot;Salisbury&quot; became the last ship to fire Squid in Royal Navy service. Examples of the mortars are on display at the Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower in Gosport, Hampshire and another at Devonport Naval Base. The system is fitted to , which is part of the historic ships collection in the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent. It can also be seen on , which is on display in Hamilton, Ontario and at the naval museum in Malacca, Malaysia.

In Swedish service the system soldiered on until 1982 when the &quot;Östergötland&quot;-class destroyers were decommissioned.

<doc id="1118558" wikidata="Q1417652" url="?curid=1118558" title="Melon de Bourgogne">
<text>Melon de Bourgogne () or Melon () is a variety of white grape grown primarily in the Loire Valley region of France. It is also grown in North America. It is best known through its use in the white wine Muscadet.

In the U.S., Federal law prevents &quot;Muscadet&quot; from being used for American-produced wine; only the full name of the grape, or the shortened &quot;Melon&quot; can be used.

==History==
As its name suggests, the grape originated in Burgundy and was grown there until its destruction was ordered in the early 18th century. In the vineyards around Nantes and the western Loire, however, the harsh winter of 1709 destroyed so many vines that a new variety was needed, and the Melon grape was introduced. Since then it has been used solely in the production of the light dry white wine Muscadet, which is made entirely from the Melon grape. The grape is so associated with its appellation that the grape itself is often known as Muscadet. 

DNA analysis has revealed Melon de Bourgogne to be a cross between Pinot blanc and Gouais blanc. 

==North America==

As of 2007, the grape is grown in Oregon. where it is known simply as Melon. The grape has been introduced into Washington by Perennial Vintners on Bainbridge Island, six miles across Puget Sound from Seattle. This grape was brought to America in 1939, and was propagated incorrectly as Pinot Blanc in the early 1980s. For more on this error, see also &quot;Melon de Bourgogne - History&quot; at MelonDeBourgogne.com.

== Synonyms ==
Melon de Bourgogne is also known under the synonyms Auxerrois Gros, Biaune, Blanc de Nantes, Bourgogne blanche, Bourgogne verde, Bourgogne verte, Bourguignon blanc, Clozier, Feher Nagyburgundi, Feuille Ronde, Gamay blanc, Gamay Blanc à Feuilles Rondes, Gamay Blanc Feuilles Rondes, Game Kruglolistnyi, Gros Auxerrois, Gros blanc, Grosse Saint Marie, Lyonnais, Lyonnaise blanche, Malin blanc, Mele, Melon, Meurlon, Mourlon, Muscadet, Perry, Petit Bourgogne, Petit Muscadet, Petite Biaune, Petoin, Petouin, Picarneau, Plant de Lons-Le-Saulnie, Roussette Basse, Später Weisser Burgunder.

<text>A NIC handle (Network Information Centre handle) is a unique alphanumeric character sequence that represents an entry in the databases maintained by Network Information Centres. When a new domain name is registered with a domain name registrar, a NIC handle is assigned by the registrar to the particular set of information associated with that domain name (such as who registered it and a contact e-mail address). Once a domain name has been registered, its NIC handle can be used to search for that record in the database.
The NIC handle was developed in 1982 by Ken Harrenstien and Vic White working at the early Network Information Center at SRI International.

== Modern use ==

The NIC Handle system is no longer commonly used by domain name registries. It was previously possible to query WHOIS by NIC handle, and see all the domains registered by that NIC handle, but this service was discontinued (presumably due to spam).

NIC Handles are still used extensively in the RIPE Database to identify people and business roles.

<text>The J-Cart is a special ROM cartridge developed by Codemasters for the Sega Genesis console. It held not only the game data but also came with two additional gamepad ports. This effectively allowed four players to play simultaneously without any extra adapters. The first J-Cart game, &quot;Tennis All-Stars&quot;, was released in early 1994.

&quot;Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament&quot; also allowed up to eight players to play simultaneously using up to four gamepads, each player using only the D-pad or face buttons.

The J-Cart came relatively late in the life cycle of the console. In addition, Codemasters never licensed the technology to other publishers. Thus the number of games released as J-Carts was limited.

<text>Wawasan 2020 or Vision 2020 is a Malaysian ideal introduced by the fourth and seventh Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad during the tabling of the Sixth Malaysia Plan in 1991. The vision calls for the nation to achieve a self-sufficient industrialised nation by the year 2020, encompasses all aspects of life, from economic prosperity, social well-being, educational worldclass, political stability, as well as psychological balance. To achieve Vision 2020, Mahathir lamented that the nation required an annual growth of 7% (in real terms) over the thirty-year period 1990–2020, so that the economy would be eightfold stronger than its 1990 GDP of RM115 billion. This would translate to a GDP of RM920 billion (in 1990 Ringgit terms) in 2020. Under Vision 2020 from 1991 to 2020, there are 3 sub 10 year development policy namely National development Policy 1991-2000 with OPP2, National Vision Policy 2001-2010 with OPP3 and New Economic Model 2011-2020 with National Transformation Programme NTP.

&quot;Wawasan 2020&quot; is also the title of an article by William Greider about globalisation in Malaysia.

==Strategic challenges==
Mahathir outlined nine strategic challenges that Malaysia must overcome to achieve Vision 2020.

* Challenge 1: Establishing a united Malaysian nation made up of one Bangsa Malaysia (Malaysian Race).
* Challenge 2: Creating a psychologically liberated, secure and developed Malaysian society.
* Challenge 3: Fostering and developing a mature democratic society.
* Challenge 4: Establishing a fully moral and ethical society.
* Challenge 5: Establishing a matured liberal and tolerant society.
* Challenge 6: Establishing a scientific and progressive society.
* Challenge 7: Establishing a fully caring society.
* Challenge 8: Ensuring an economically just society, in which there is a fair and equitable distribution of the wealth of the nation.
* Challenge 9: Establishing a prosperous society with an economy that is fully competitive, dynamic, robust and resilient.

== Song ==
Wawasan 2020 is also a patriotic song on the same idea sung in Malay. The song was composed by Farish Daniel.

== Revisions to the vision ==
In view of economic slowdown amid the financial crisis of 2007–2010, Prime Minister of the then ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) government, Najib Razak in August 2009, stated that in order for Malaysia to achieve a developed nation status by 2020, the country has to grow at an annual rate of 8% over the next 10 years. He cited that a lower hypothetical growth of 6% per annum would delay Malaysia&#x27;s vision to become a developed country by 10 years to 2030. Malaysia’s GDP growth rate averaged 7.2% per annum in the 1990s, and slowed to 5.4% per annum in the following decade. Najib also stated the need to redefine and recalibrate the vision in terms of how to achieve it, as well as its timeline. Besides, Malaysia has to undertake bold economic reforms, and Najib had tasked the National Economic Advisory Council (NEAC) to carry out a review of the vision. The NEAC is expected to publish its report by end 2009, with a second report on implementation 6 months after that.

Just before the downfall of BN federal government in the 2018 general election (GE14), Najib had launched the National Transformation 2050 or &quot;Transformasi Nasional 2050&quot; (TN50) initiative, where by 2050 Malaysia will be &quot;a nation of calibre, with a new mindset&quot;. The TN50 was allegedly initiated by Najib to undermine Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s &quot;Wawasan 2020&quot; legacy. The TN50 had somehow fallen through and was officially dismantled with some aspirations maintained by the Pakatan Harapan (PH)&#x27;s &quot;Malaysia Baharu&quot; government after the GE14.

==Outcome==
In 2020, Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia after Pakatan Harapan coalition came to power in 2018, officially announced the failure of the vision to achieve the status of developed nation. Although Wawasan 2020 did not fully achieve its objectives, Mahathir argued that other aspects of the vision had been achieved such that Malaysia has become more prosperous and with better infrastructure. Mahathir blamed his handpicked successors Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Najib Razak for failing to properly implement his plan.

In terms of GDP growth, Malaysia last achieved yearly GDP growth of more than 7% in 2000. Since then, the Malaysian GDP only averages between 4% and 5% until 2018.

In terms of how well Malaysians are meeting the nine challenges listed by Mahathir in 1990, &quot;The Full Frontal&quot; website stated that challenges no 4 and no 7 are almost fully met while other challenges still have lots of room for improvement.

<doc id="1118602" wikidata="Q1069954" url="?curid=1118602" title="Prosecco">
<text>Prosecco (, ) is an Italian DOC or DOCG white wine produced in a large area spanning nine provinces in the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, and named after the village of Prosecco, in the province of Trieste, Italy. It is made from the Prosecco grape (renamed &quot;Glera&quot; in Italy in 2009), but denomination rules allow up to 15% of the wine to be other permitted varieties. Prosecco is almost always made in sparkling or semi-sparkling style (&#x27; and&#x27;, respectively), but a still wine (&quot;&quot;) is also permitted. Within the larger designation are two small DOCG areas, &quot;Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco&quot; in the hills between the &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, and &quot;Asolo Prosecco&quot; around the nearby &quot;comune&quot; of Asolo. Prosecco &quot;Superiore&quot; is always &quot;spumante&quot; and comes only from these DOCG areas.

In 2019, Le Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in large part due to the region&#x27;s role in the production of Prosecco. Since 2020, the DOC rules allow a rosé variety of Prosecco designated &quot;spumante rosé&quot;, which must contain Glera blended with 10–15% Pinot nero.

==History==


In Trieste at the beginning of the 16th century, the local wine &quot;Ribolla&quot; was promoted as the recreation of the Pucinian celebrated by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; and praised for its medicinal qualities by Livia, the wife of Emperor Augustus. The need to distinguish the &quot;Ribolla&quot; of Trieste from other wines of the same name, produced in Gorizia and at lower cost in Istria, led, at the end of the century, to a change in name. Following the supposed place of production in antiquity, the wine was referred to as &quot;castellum nobile vinum Pucinum&quot;, after the castle near the village of Prosecco.

The first known mention of the name &quot;Prosecco&quot; is attributed to the Englishman Fynes Moryson, who used the spelling &quot;Prosecho&quot;. Moryson, visiting the north of Italy in 1593, notes: &quot;Histria is devided into Forum Julii, and Histria properly so called ... Here growes the wine Pucinum, now called Prosecho, much celebrated by Pliny.&quot; He places Prosecco among the famous wines of Italy: &quot;These are the most famous Wines of Italy. La lagrima di Christo and like wines neere Cinque Terre in Liguria: La vernazza, and the white Muskadine, especially that of Montefiaschoni in Tuscany: Cecubum and Falernum in the Kingdom of Naples, and Prosecho in Histria.&quot;
The method of vinification, the true distinguishing feature of the original Prosecco, spread first in Gorizia, then—through Venice—in Dalmatia, Vicenza, and Treviso.

In 1754, the spelling &quot;Prosecco&quot; appears for the first time in the book &quot;Il Roccolo Ditirambo&quot;, written by Aureliano Acanti in Novoledo, in the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Villaverla, located in the province of Vicenza. The wine was then known by the local Slovene-speaking population as Prosegker or Prosekar and was grown on the Adriatic coast near the villages of Contovello, Prosecco, Santa Croce and the former Roman villa town Barcola.

The verses are: (in Italian), &quot;And now I would like to wet my mouth with that Prosecco with its apple bouquet. From Monteberico this perfect favorite prosecco Our Priest give us. ... Mr Priest Jacopo Ghellini brother of Mr Pietro and Mr Marco. Those cavaliers from their estate on the Mount Berico (Monte Berico) collect the Prosecco, that has the most rare qualities, that a wine could have from any other place.&quot; Monte Berico is the hill of the city of Vicenza.

The wine was defined by the grape used to make it, Prosecco. The village of Prosecco was about 150 km from the growing areas, and had never grown the glera grape. British importers started to be interested in importing the wine in quantity; in response the Italian minister of agriculture expanded the &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) to cover far-away Prosecco. This was followed by claiming UNESCO World Heritage status for &quot;Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene&quot; a few years later. Prosecco was introduced into the mainstream US market in 2000 by Mionetto, now the largest US importer of Prosecco, who reported an &quot;incredible growth trend&quot; in 2008. According to a 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; report, Prosecco rose sharply in popularity in markets outside Italy, with global sales growing by double-digit percentages since 1998, aided also by its comparatively low price. The UK became in the mid-2010s the biggest export market for Prosecco, consuming one quarter of all Italian production. Production expanded massively, to €500m sales in 2019.

Until the 2008 vintage Prosecco was protected as a DOC within Italy, as &quot;Prosecco di Conegliano-Valdobbiadene&quot;, &quot;Prosecco di Conegliano&quot;, &quot;Prosecco di Valdobbiadene&quot;, and &quot;Prosecco di Colli Asolani&quot;. From 2009, these two area were promoted to DOCG status. To further protect the name, an association of traditional Prosecco growers advocated a protected designation of origin (PDO) status for northern Italian Prosecco under European law. Hence, since 1 January 2010, Prosecco is, according to an order of the Italian Minister of Agriculture of 17 July 2009, no longer the name of a grape variety (now to be called Glera), but exclusively a geographical indication. This was confirmed by EG-Regulation Nr. 1166/2009 of 30 November 2009. The Colli Asolani Prosecco Superiore DOCG later changed its name to Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG in 2014.

==Production==

Unlike Champagne and Franciacorta DOCG, Prosecco is usually produced using the alternative Charmat–Martinotti method, in which the secondary fermentation takes place in large stainless steel tanks rather than in each individual bottle, making the wine less expensive to produce, and the minimum production time is 30 days. Higher quality Prosecco using this method will ferment the wine over a longer period, up to around 9 months (Charmat Lungo). Nevertheless, the production rules for both the DOCG&#x27;s also allow the use of the traditional method of secondary fermentation in the bottle, known in Italy as Metodo Classico. DOC and DOCG rules allow up to 15% of Prosecco wine to be a blend of Verdiso, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Perera, Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, or Pinot nero (vinified white).

Approximately 150 million bottles of Prosecco were produced in 2008. Huge subsequent growth meant this figure approached 600 million bottles in 2018.

Since the 2000s, Glera grapes are cultivated and wine produced in other countries, including Brazil, Romania, Argentina, and Australia.

In the region of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene DOCG, there are more than 150 producers, and together they form the Consortium for the Protection of Prosecco from Conegliano and Valdobbiadene (Consorzio per la Tutela del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene). DOCG also has its own consorzio, with 94 producers.

===Prosecco DOC===

Most Prosecco, whether DOC or DOCG, is made as Spumante sparkling wine or Frizzante (semi-sparkling). Prosecco DOC Spumante is the most famous and popular variety, with longer-lasting bubbles. Prosecco DOC Frizzante has bubbles that linger for a shorter time. A small proportion is made as Tranquillo (still wine), with no bubbles. &quot;Tranquillo&quot; amounts to only about 5% of production, and this wine is rarely exported.
Depending on their sweetness, in accordance with the EU Sweetness of wine Regulations for Terms used to indicate sweetness of sparkling wine, Proseccos are labelled &quot;Brut&quot; (up to 12 grams per litre of residual sugar), &quot;Extra Dry&quot; (12–17 g/L) or &quot;Dry&quot; (17–32 g/L). Extra-Dry has been the dominant style made, but the amount of Brut is now increasing.

Glera grapes made in a Prosecco style outside the DOC/DOCG have a non-protected designation, such as &quot;IGT Veneto&quot;, are generally cheaper and of more variable quality and cannot be called Prosecco. While all Prosecco is currently vinified white, a rosé version has been proposed, but only for the DOC, as it was rejected by the DOCG. It is probably that such a rosé, which would include a small proportion of Pinot nero vinified red, will be adopted only at the DOC level from the 2019 harvest and therefore be available to buy from as early as January 2020.

===Prosecco Superiore DOCG===

There are two Prosecco Superiore DOCGs, divided by the River Piave, in the province of Treviso, Veneto. Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG is made on the hills between the &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) of Conegliano, Valdobbiadene, and Vittorio Veneto. Producers from Valdobbiadene have recently tended to skip mention of Conegliano on their front label, calling their wine &quot;Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore&quot;. The second DOCG is the smaller Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG, produced on the hills near the &quot;comune&quot; of Asolo. Currently, in addition to the usual range of Prosecco styles, Asolo DOCG can also make an &quot;Extra-Brut&quot; (0-6 g/L), and Conegliano Valdobbiadene is expected to introduce this style soon. While the bulk of Prosecco DOC is grown on low-lying plains in an extended area covering 23,300 hectares, the DOCG Prosecco Superiore is grown exclusively on hillside vineyards in two far smaller growing areas, 6,860 hectares for Conegliano Valdobbiadene and 1,783 hectares for Asolo. The steepness of the hills means that everything, from pruning to picking, is principally done by hand. The manual aspect, especially for the harvest, further increases quality.

===Superiore di Cartizze subzone===
The hill of Cartizze is a high vineyard of of vines, owned by 140 growers. The Prosecco from its grapes, of which comparatively little is produced, is widely considered to be of the highest quality, or even the &quot;Grand Cru&quot; of Prosecco.

Theoretically, a hectare of Cartizze grape land was estimated to be worth in excess of 1 million US dollars in 2008 and its value was estimated to have increased to 1.5–2 million euros in 2015, the most for a vineyard in Italy. The sparkling wine produced from Cartizze has recently been named by producers as &quot;Superiore di Cartizze&quot;, without mentioning Prosecco on the front label to further emphasize its territory.

According to a local legend, Cartizze grapes traditionally were harvested last, as the vines were situated on steep slopes and hard to reach, which led to vintners discovering that this extended ripening period improved the flavour. Nonetheless, in a blind tasting at the 2006 Vinitaly trade fair, Cartizze &quot;spumanti&quot; were ranked consistently behind &quot;normal&quot; Prosecco.

===Rive subzones===
While Cartizze is a subzone at the top of the Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG quality pyramid, their Consorzio has also introduced official &quot;Rive&quot; delimitations, i.e. 15 communes that can make 43 different Rive subzone wines. These are named after the individual hills where the grapes originate, though this adds complexity and adoption so far is patchy. The intention is to highlight the different microclimates and distinct terroirs found in the DOCG. Asolo Superiore DOCG has not introduced subzones.

===Col Fondo===
Some winemakers are reviving the traditional Prosecco Col Fondo, refermented in the bottle but not disgorged, as the wines are left on their lees. This yeasty residue leaves fine sediment in the bottom of the bottle (Italian: &quot;fondo&quot;) that imparts more complexity, texture and flavour. They can be served either clear or cloudy. These wines are labelled Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG, or Asolo Superiore DOCG. Col Fondo generally has a lower Frizzante-style of pressure.

==Consumption==

In Italy, Prosecco is a ubiquitously used wine. Outside Italy, it is most often drunk as an apéritif. As with other sparkling wines, Prosecco is served chilled.

Except for Col Fondo and any Método Classico Prosecco, most Prosecco does not ferment in the bottle. Usually, it should be drunk young, preferably within three to five years of its vintage. However, high-quality Prosecco may be aged for up to seven years.

The view that Prosecco cannot be aged has been challenged by other experts. A tasting in 2013 of wines produced between 1983 and 2013 demonstrated the longevity of the wines from one of their top producers.

Prosecco has a minimum of 10.5–11.5% alcohol by volume, depending on the DOC/DOCG rules. The flavour of Prosecco has been described as aromatic and crisp, bringing to mind yellow apple, pear, white peach, and apricot. Most Prosecco variants have intense primary aromas and are meant to taste fresh, light and comparatively simple.

Most commonly Prosecco is served unmixed, but it also appears in several mixed drinks. It is the main ingredient in the original Bellini and Spritz cocktails, and it can also be used in others, such as the Mimosa. With vodka and lemon gelato, Prosecco is also an ingredient of the Italian mixed drink &quot;sgroppino&quot;.

<doc id="1118604" wikidata="Q168810" url="?curid=1118604" title="Energy (Operation Ivy album)">
<text>Energy is the only studio album by the American ska punk band Operation Ivy. It was released on vinyl and cassette in May 1989 through Lookout! Records with the catalog number LK 010. Although the album itself has never been released on CD, all of the tracks were featured on the career-spanning compilation &quot;Operation Ivy&quot; issued by Lookout in 1991. Despite achieving no mainstream success, &quot;Energy&quot; is considered one of the most important albums of ska punk and is frequently cited as an influence by many later bands of the genre.

The album stayed in print on Lookout until 2006, when the band took back its recordings from the label due to unpaid royalties. Guitarist Tim &quot;Lint&quot; Armstrong&#x27;s label Hellcat Records re-released the original album as a 12-inch LP picture disc in 2004, and in 2007 put out a remastered version of the self-titled compilation. A second vinyl edition was released by Hellcat on April 18, 2012 and debuted at number 13 on the Vinyl Albums chart.

==Background and recording==
Shortly after returning from a short US tour in June 1988, the band played a show at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California with Crimpshrine, Isocracy and The Lookouts. Following the show, the band stopped at a local burrito shop with Lookout Records owners Larry Livermore and David Hayes to discuss future plans. Livermore and Hayes suggested recording a follow-up EP to their debut &quot;Hectic&quot;, but the band members revealed that they intended to do a full studio album. Figuring the band was not ready to record an album, and fearing that Lookout did not have enough money to put it out, Livermore and Hayes attempted to talk the band out of their decision, but to no avail. As guitarist Lint would later say, &quot;You can tell Operation Ivy, but you can&#x27;t tell &#x27;em much.&quot;

The original intent was to record the album live at 924 Gilman Street during closed hours with minimal overdubs, with Gilman soundman Radley Hirsch as engineer. &quot;I think they were hoping to capture the electricity and excitement of their live shows, a nice trick if you could manage it&quot;, Livermore later said. &quot;But without an audience, Gilman was just a barn-like structure with mediocre acoustics. It lacked soundproofing, isolation booths, a control room and all those features.&quot; During recording, however, the band ran into a number of disagreements with Hirsch, such as not wanting Lint to use distortion on his guitar and having bassist Matt McCall use an Ampeg SVT amp that &quot;sounded like Blue Cheer or something.&quot; The sessions dragged on for &quot;what seemed like forever&quot; due to the engineer&#x27;s decision to record overdubs and weeks were spent working on single songs. Livermore was also dissatisfied with the recordings, saying &quot;Some were as good or better than anything Lookout had done, but others just felt... weird.&quot; By December 1988, the members were unsure if they wanted to continue working on the album and arranged a band meeting to decide what to do. After agreeing to start over from scratch, Livermore was assigned with the task of firing Hirsch from the project and the band went to Sound and Vision Studios in San Francisco with Kevin Army in January 1989 to re-record the album. Recording went quickly during these sessions, with the band completing basic tracks for the entire album in one day. &quot;It was a live recording, because we went in there and we just went down the list. We weren&#x27;t really taking breaks at all,&quot; according to McCall. &quot;We didn’t want to slow down, we just wanted to get it done because we were on a roll.&quot;

==Release==
Once recording was finally finished, the band began working on artwork and packaging. Michaels drew the front cover and originally intended to put together the lyric sheet, but could not finish it before it was due and had Hayes take over. The album was finished in March and due for release two months later in May. As a celebration, Livermore and the band booked a record release party concert at Gilman on May 28 that also included Green Day, Surrogate Brains, Crimpshrine and The Lookouts on the bill, all of which also had records coming out. However, a few weeks before the concert, Lint and McCall went to see Livermore &quot;looking utterly shell-shocked&quot; and revealed that Michaels had decided to leave the group and that they intended to break up. &quot;I remember me and Jesse, we were on Telegraph, I was buying him some beer&quot;, Lint later said. &quot;Me and him talked about how the band wasn&#x27;t really what it was when it started. It was like a mutual thing. That&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s not usually told, it wasn&#x27;t like he quit, it was like, ‘Yeah, we&#x27;re not really into it anymore.&#x27;&quot; As a result, the planned record release party became the band&#x27;s last public performance. They later played one more private show the following day in Robert Eggplant&#x27;s backyard in Pinole, California.

==Reception and legacy==

In a retrospective review, Adam Bregman of AllMusic considered &quot;Energy&quot; among the best albums of the ska punk genre. He praised the album for &quot;succeed[ing] in combining all sorts of elements&quot; and called it an &quot;unsurpassed, highly intelligent, extremely fun record.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Energy&quot; was ranked as the highest rated punk album of 1989 and 6th highest rated ever on Sputnikmusic. 

Many artists have covered the songs on &quot;Energy&quot; (and &quot;Hectic&quot;), including the tribute album &quot;Take Warning: The Songs of Operation Ivy&quot;. The Leftöver Crack song &quot;Gay Rude Boys Unite&quot; is a parody of &quot;Unity&quot; and the introduction music is deliberately similar to that of &quot;Yellin&#x27; in My Ear&quot;. Split Lip&#x27;s 1996 compilation album &quot;Archived Music for Stubborn People: Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before&quot; included a cover of &quot;Unity.&quot;
Goldfinger covered the song &quot;Smiling&quot; on their live album &quot;Foot in Mouth&quot;. Hollywood Undead covered the song &quot;Bad Town&quot; on their album Desperate Measures. &quot;Knowledge&quot; has been covered by Green Day on their &quot;Slappy&quot; EP (later featured on the &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; collection) and Millencolin on their &quot;Skauch&quot; EP.

The American punk rock band Energy named themselves after this album.

<text>NetDevil Ltd. was an American developer of massively multiplayer online games, based in Louisville, Colorado and owned by Gazillion Entertainment.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
NetDevil was founded in 1997 by Scott Brown, Peter Grundy and Steven Williams in Louisville, a suburb north of Denver, Colorado. Before forming NetDevil, Brown, Grundy, and Williams worked at Digital Creators, an information technology firm located in Boulder, Colorado. The three dreamed of being creators of their own digital worlds, and began developing &quot;&quot;, a space-based flight simulator MMO, during their spare evenings and weekends. After a year of part-time work, they quit their jobs and started NetDevil, headquartered in the basement of Scott Brown&#x27;s home. Their first proper office was , sub-leased from friends with another technology company. In an interview with GameDaily, Scott Brown shared that at one point they had fourteen people packed into one big room.

According to the company&#x27;s website, the name NetDevil was chosen because of the &quot;owners&#x27; obsession with cool scary things that live in the deep dark waters of the world&quot;. All of the company&#x27;s principals are certified SCUBA divers, including one certified dive master.

=== New location ===
In June 2007, NetDevil announced that they had completed moving into their new location in Louisville, Colorado, a nearly office facility which includes a professional sound studio, user testing facility and LEGO model shop. To celebrate their 10th anniversary, they hosted a party at their new location.

=== Acquisition by Gazillion Entertainment ===
In July 2008, NetDevil was purchased by game publisher Gazillion Entertainment, though this was not made public until March 2009.

=== Departures of founders ===
In the last months of 2010, all remaining founders of NetDevil, notably Scott Brown, Peter Grundy, and Ryan Seabury, who headed the LEGO Universe team, chose to leave the company. Brown and Seabury started End Games Entertainment, whose first product is a Facebook game titled Vorp!

=== Layoffs ===
In February 2011, two rounds of layoffs took place at the NetDevil studio. The first round eliminated the Jumpgate Evolution development team. The second downsized the LEGO Universe team and appears to be part of a deal in which Gazillion passed control of development of LEGO Universe to the LEGO Group. This was an effect of the slow failure of LEGO Universe.

==Products==

===Released===
&quot;&quot; (2001) – A massively multiplayer online flight simulator set in space. Though it was initially published by 3DO, NetDevil regained control of the game in 2002, due to 3DO&#x27;s bankruptcy. Jumpgate was shut down on April 30, 2012. Although the player community has expressed interest in acquiring the source code for &quot;Jumpgate&quot;, Gazillion has, at this time, not made it available.

&quot;Auto Assault&quot; (2006) – A massively multiplayer online game that combined vehicular combat with role-playing elements, allowing the player to explore a post-apocalyptic future in customizable cars, motorcycles, semis, and tanks. It was published by NCsoft, and shut down in 2007.

&quot;&quot; (2007) – An apocalyptic, first-person shooter (FPS), built around the AGEIA PhysX processor with Unreal Engine 3. It featured a piece-by-piece destruction system and fluid and cloth-based effects.

&quot;Lego Universe&quot; (2010) – A children&#x27;s MMO product in which LEGO minifigures join the Nexus Force, to defeat the Maelstrom. LEGO Universe development largely supported NetDevil from 2007 until the studio was closed by Gazillion and control of the product released to LEGO, and shut down in 2012.

===In development===
&quot;Jumpgate Evolution&quot; – In June 2007, NetDevil announced plans for &quot;Jumpgate Evolution&quot;, a remake of NetDevil&#x27;s first project, the classic MMO &quot;Jumpgate&quot;. The space-based title was planned to receive a massive graphical revamp, along with many new features. In December 2007, NetDevil announced the launch of a website for Jumpgate Evolution containing backstory written by Keith Baker, in-game footage, screenshots and video, community forums, and a fan site kit available for download. This project was cancelled with the layoff of the development team in February 2011.

<doc id="1118619" wikidata="Q2093002" url="?curid=1118619" title="Volga Türki">
<text>The Volga Turki language was a literary language used by some ethnic groups of the Volga-Ural region (Tatars and Bashkirs) from the Middle Ages until the 19th century.

Volga Turki is a member of the Kipchak (or Northwestern) group of Turkic languages, although it is partly derived from the ancient Bulgar language (the first poem, considered to be written by Qul Ghali in Volga Turki dates back to Volga Bulgaria&#x27;s epoch). It included many Persian and Arabic loans.

In its written form the language was spelled uniformly among different ethnic groups, speaking different Turkic languages of the Kipchak group, but pronunciation differed from one people to another, approximating to the spoken language, making this written form universal for different languages. The main reason for this universal usage was that the principal differences between the languages of the Kipchak group are in the pronunciation of the vowels, which was not adequately represented by the Arabic script.

The language formerly used the Arabic script and later its variant İske imlâ. The Volga Turki language is a language of Idel-Ural poetry and literature. With the Ottoman Turkish, Azeri, Kipchak, Khaqani Turkic and Chagatai, they were the only Turkic literary languages used in the Middle Ages. It was actively used in publishing until 1905, when the first Tatar and Bashkir newspaper started being published in modern Tatar and Bashkir language, which until then had been used only in a spoken form.

<doc id="1118620" wikidata="Q1521881" url="?curid=1118620" title="Pertenhall">
<text>Pertenhall is a small village and civil parish located in Bedfordshire, close to the borders of Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. Its parish council is a Quality Parish Council. It has recently published its Parish Plan which is available on the website

The name derives from Peters Hill (allegedly) based on the Hill by St Peters Church. The parish of Pertenhall &amp; Swineshead is part of the Stodden Hundred (which comprises Bolnhurst, Clapham, Dean and Shelton, Keysoe, Knotting, Little Staughton, Melchbourne, Milton Ernest, Oakley, Pertenhall, Riseley, Shelton, Tilbrook and Yelden).

The village is drawn out along the B660 beginning with Chapel Yard, derived from the Moravian Chapel located there and is characterised by a series of &#x27;Ends&#x27;, namely Wood End (a cul-de-sac, terminating at a footpath known locally as &#x27;the Track&#x27;, Chadwell End (a thoroughfare), derived from the Chad Well that exists nearby and leading to Green End at the south.

==World War II==
During the war the village had a propaganda school for the Special Operations Executive (SOE).

== Moravian Chapel ==
Little remains of the chapel itself but there are still gravestones in the graveyard.

== St Peter&#x27;s Church ==
The village&#x27;s oldest building is the church, which dates from Norman times. There are also a number of interesting buildings such as the Manor House, Hoo Farm and Green End Farm House, all of which date back several hundred years.

== Village Hall ==

The Village Hall was formerly the Village School which was in use from 1870 to 1946. The school was built on a site bequeathed by the Reverend John King Martyn M.A. and a plaque in the hall commemorates this. John King Martyn was the grandson of the botanist John Martyn.

== Education ==

<doc id="1118623" wikidata="Q5193633" url="?curid=1118623" title="Culture of Sarajevo">
<text>The [[Culture]] of [[Sarajevo]] is represented in various ways.

Numerous cultural festivals occur every year, such as the Bašćaršija Nights, Sarajevo Winter Festival, and the Sarajevo Jazz Festival.

==Theatre==
Numerous theatres are present in Sarajevo as well, such as the National Theatre of Sarajevo. The first ever Bosnian opera was held in Sarajevo in 2003. Theatres are also an important part of Sarajevo culture. The first great Sarajevo theatre was the national theatre of Bosnia and Herzegovina, built in 1919 and surviving to this day. Prior to that, plays were often held in parks or at the large houses of wealthy families. Sarajevo also houses the Sarajevo Youth Theatre.

==Libraries==
Sarajevo also holds many of the most famous historical texts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were largely held in the Sarajevo City (and University) Library that was built in 1896. Unfortunately Serbian ultranationalists purposely fired upon the building with incendiary shells. They succeeded in setting the building on fire, and along with it thousands of irreplaceable texts. Today an international effort is underway to replace what was lost.

In Ottoman times, the Gazi Husrev-beg library was one of the largest and greatest in the Balkans. Destroyed since, it is currently being rebuilt in a stunning modern form that will house many of the oldest texts found in the city.

===Writers===
Historically, Sarajevo was home to several famous Bosnian writers, poets and thinkers. Nobel Prize-winner Ivo Andrić attended high school in Sarajevo for two years. Multiple award-winning writer Zlatko Topčić is from the city.

Sarajevo is also home to the Sarajevo Haggadah, one of the oldest surviving such texts, originating from the 14th century and brought by Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. As of late, modern art has flourished in the city as well.

Contemporary poet Semezdin Mehmedinović wrote Sarajevo Blues from inside the city during the siege of Sarajevo in 1992.

==Cultural institutions==
Sarajevo is home to a number of cultural institutions dedicated to upkeeping the city&#x27;s culture. The notable Bosniak institute is housed in an impressive building in central Sarajevo, and features various interesting exhibits dealing with the city&#x27;s and country&#x27;s culture and history. Also notable are the International Center for Kids and Youth in New Sarajevo and the Center for Sarajevo Culture.

The most famous in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is located in central Sarajevo. It was established in 1888, from an idea dating back to the first half of the 19th century. The Sarajevo Haggadah is held there. While in Sarajevo one can also visit the Ars Aevi Museum of Contemporary Art, the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Museum of the City of Sarajevo, the War Childhood Museum and the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Museum of Literature. There existed an impressive Olympic museum dedicated to the 84 games, but it was destroyed in warfare. Part of the exhibition has been relocated to a small exhibition hall on the site of the Zetra Stadium.

==Music==
An interesting aspect of the city&#x27;s culture is its rich musical history. Many regard it as the most musically influential city in the Balkans, especially during the 20th century. &quot;Kad ja pođoh na Benbašu&quot; is a great example of traditional Bosnian music, and it is one of the city&#x27;s unofficial anthems. The city is home to the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra.

During the second half of the 20th century, Sarajevo was a center of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Some of the bands from the Sarajevo school of pop rock, such as Bijelo Dugme and Indeksi, are arguably the greatest Yugoslav rock bands of all time. After them come a wide array of other bands and performers considered &quot;greats&quot; and &quot;legends&quot;, such as Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Zabranjeno Pušenje, and others. Solo artists such as Kemal Monteno and Dino Merlin also gained much prominence. Monteno&#x27;s song, &quot;Sarajevo Ljubavi Moja&quot; (Sarajevo Love of Mine), is another unofficial anthem of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is also the hometown of one of the most significant ex-Yugoslavian alternative industrial-noise bands, SCH.

==Cinema==
The Sarajevo Film Festival has been held since 1995 and has become the premier film festival in the Balkans. Largely due to its size and the success and popularity of cinema in Bosnia, the event has gained considerable importance and often attracts foreign celebrities. The Sarajevo Winter Festival is also well-known, as are the Bašćaršija Nights, a month-long showcase of local culture, music, and dance.

The city is also present internationally in various forms of pop culture. The film &quot;Welcome to Sarajevo&quot; was released in 1997. The Irish rock band U2 had a hit song with &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;, and progressive metal group Savatage&#x27;s 1995 Concept Album &quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot; deals with the story of Sarajevo&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet. Sarajevo is also the name of a jam band from East Windsor, New Jersey.

<text>This article provides a summary of results for the [[general election]]s to the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]]″s unicameral legislative body, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The number of seats has varied over time, from a low of thirty during the 1930s and early 1940s, to the current high of fifty-two. This article only covers elections since Nova Scotia became part of the newly formed Canadian Confederation in 1867. Prior to that, Nova Scotia was a British colony. The Nova Scotia House of Assembly dates back to 1758, and Nova Scotia became the first British colony to be granted responsible government from London in 1848.

The chart on the upper right provides a graphical summary of the results, with the most recent elections towards the right. It shows how the Liberal party (red) dominated the province&#x27;s early political history, winning nineteen of the first twenty-two elections from 1867 to 1953; and that since 1953, the Conservatives (blue) have been the most successful party, winning eleven of the fifteen elections since then. The New Democratic Party (orange), after winning Official Opposition status in four consecutive elections, finally achieved government for the first time in the 2009 election.

==Summary of results==
The table below shows the total number of seats won by the major political parties at each election. It also shows the percentage of the vote obtained by the major political parties at each election, if greater than 0.1%. The winning party&#x27;s totals are shown in bold. To date, no party has formed a government that did not have the largest share of the vote. Full details on any election are linked via the number of the election at the start of the row.

===Notes===
: Includes results for Progressive Conservatives.
: Includes results for Co-operative Commonwealth Federation prior to 1963; and also results for the Labour party prior to 1937.

<text>Herbert Akroyd-Stuart (28 January 1864 – 19 February 1927) was an English inventor who is noted for his invention of the hot bulb engine, or heavy oil engine.

==Life==
Akroyd-Stuart was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, but lived in Australia for a period in his early years. He was educated at Newbury Grammar School (now St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School) and Finsbury Technical College in London. He was the son of Charles Stuart, founder of the Bletchley Iron and Tinplate Works, joining his father in the business in 1887.

==Oil engines==
In 1885, Akroyd Stuart accidentally spilt paraffin oil (kerosene) into a pot of molten tin. The paraffin oil vaporised and caught fire when in contact with a paraffin lamp. This gave him an idea to pursue the possibility of using paraffin oil (very similar to modern-day diesel) for an engine, which unlike petrol proved difficult to vaporise in a carburettor because its volatility is insufficient.

His first prototype engines were built in 1886. In 1890, in collaboration with Charles Richard Binney, he filed Patent 7146 for Richard Hornsby and Sons of Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The patent was entitled: &quot;Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air&quot;. One such engine was sold to Newport Sanitary Authority, but the compression ratio was too low to get it started from cold, and it needed a heat poultice to get it going.

=== Hornsby–Akroyd engine===

Akroyd-Stuart&#x27;s engines were built from 26 June 1891 by Richard Hornsby and Sons as the &quot;Hornsby Akroyd Patent Oil Engine&quot; under licence and were first sold commercially on 8 July 1892. It was the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurised fuel injection system.

The Hornsby–Akroyd engine used a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion. Combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber, the &quot;vaporizer&quot; (also called the &quot;hot bulb&quot;) mounted on the cylinder head, into which fuel was sprayed. It was connected to the cylinder by a narrow passage and was heated either by the cylinder&#x27;s coolant or by exhaust gases while running; an external flame such as a blowtorch was used for starting. Self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vaporizer. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attached to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence was set up as the ignited gases flashed through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion was completed. As the engine&#x27;s load increased, so did the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water was dripped into the air intake.

Hot bulb engines were produced until the late 1920s, often being called &quot;semi-diesels&quot;, even though they were not as efficient as compression ignition engines. They had the advantage of comparative simplicity, since they did not require the air compressor used by early Diesel engines; fuel was injected mechanically (solid injection) near the start of the compression stroke, at a much lower pressure than that of Diesel engines.

===Oil-engined locomotive===
Richard Hornsby and Sons built the world&#x27;s first oil-engined railway locomotive LACHESIS for the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England, in 1896. They also built the first compression-ignition powered automobile.

===Oil engines outside the UK===
;Sweden
Similar engines were built by Bolinder in Sweden and some of these still survive in canal boats.

;United States
Hot bulb engines were built in the USA by the De La Vergne Company of New York City, later the New York Refrigerating Company – inventing the modern refrigerator in 1930, who purchased a licence in 1893.

===Akroyd engine and Diesel engine===

Both the Diesel engine and the Akroyd engine run the same kind of fuel, petroleum oil, which has led to a dispute about whether or not the Diesel engine is based upon the Akroyd engine. The fact that the Diesel engine&#x27;s operating principle differs from the operating principle Rudolf Diesel describes in his essay &quot;Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor&quot; further contributed to this. The Akroyd engine was the first functional internal combustion engine that could use petroleum oil as fuel. It was operational in 1891, six years before the Diesel engine first ran. However, after the Diesel engine had proven successful, &quot;Diesel engine&quot; became the synonym for an engine that ran on any sort of petroleum oil. &quot;Oil engines&quot; that used the Akroyd operating principle were called &quot;semi-Diesel&quot;, and the name &quot;Akroyd&quot;, which had been associated with oil engines, fell out of use. Therefore, Herbert Akroyd Stuart sought to replace the term Diesel engine with Akroyd engine in the early 20th century.

Herbert Akroyd Stuart had two patents, No. 7146 &quot;Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air&quot;, and No. 15994. In the former, the Akroyd engine&#x27;s operating principle is described as follows: &quot;... at the desired part of this compression stroke, the supply of liquid hydrocarbon is forced, in a spray form, on to the heated vaporiser, which almost instantly changes it into a gas...&quot;. Early Akroyd engines indeed operated on this principle. Rudolf Diesel had a patent on the combustion process described in his essay (DRP 67207). The Diesel engine neither operates on the process described in the Akroyd patent, nor on the process described in the DRP 67207 patent. It operates instead on a different operating principle, also invented by Rudolf Diesel (patented in 1893, DRP 82168), which is why Diesel is in fact the Diesel engine&#x27;s inventor. However, Diesel never admitted that his engine operated on a &quot;secret&quot; operating principle, and claimed that the Diesel engine operates on the (impossible) operating process described in the DRP 67207 patent.

The key difference between the Akroyd and Diesel engines is the ignition: In an Akroyd engine, an ignition devicethe &quot;hot bulb&quot;, or &quot;vaporiser&quot;ignites the fuel, because the compression is too low for compression ignition (&lt;300 kPa). A Diesel engine on the other hand has no discrete ignition devices. The fuel instead ignites due to high heat caused solely by piston compression inside the cylinder (&gt;3000 kPa). Since higher compression leads to better efficiency, the lower-pressure Akroyd engine consumes ~ 80% more fuel than a Diesel engine doing the same work.

==Death==

In 1900, he moved to Australia and set up a company Sanders &amp; Stuart with his brother Charles. He died on 19 February 1927 in Perth, Australia of throat cancer. His body was transported back to England and was buried in All Souls Cemetery in Boothtown, Halifax, Yorkshire. All Souls Church was built at the sole expense of his maternal uncle, Edward Akroyd.

The University of Nottingham has hosted the Akroyd-Stuart Memorial Lecture on occasional years in his memory since 1928. One was presented by Sir Frank Whittle in 1946. Akroyd Stuart had worked with Professor William Robinson in the late 19th century, who was professor of engineering from 1890 to 1924 at University College Nottingham.

Akroyd-Stuart also left money to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Royal Aeronautical Society and Institute of Marine Engineering, which provided for their respective bi-annual Akroyd-Stuart Prizes.

<doc id="1118632" wikidata="Q922478" url="?curid=1118632" title="Matija Antun Relković">
<text>Matija Antun Relković (also Reljković; 6 January 1732 – 22 January 1798) was Habsburg military officer and a Croatian writer.

== Early life and military career ==
Born in the village of Davor in Kingdom of Slavonia (today a part of Croatia) as a son of a Military Frontier officer, Relković too enlisted in the Austrian army at the age of 16. He fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War until he was captured by Prussians in Wrocław (Breslau), and spent a few years of rather &quot;relaxed&quot; imprisonment at Frankfurt (Oder). Relković&#x27;s prison years became his &quot;Lehrjahre&quot;, his educational period: a voracious but unsystematic reader, he studied many works by leading Enlightenment writers (Voltaire, Bayle, Diderot), as well as Polish poet Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s didactic epic &quot;Satir&quot;- which became the model for his most famous work. After the release, Relković spent a few more years on war campaigns (this time Bavaria), but eventually sated and bored with military life, he asked and got pension from Austrian emperor Joseph II in the rank of captain, as well as the title of hereditary noble. Having spent the rest of his life as a writer and social reformer, Relković died in Vinkovci, Croatia.

== Bibliography ==
Considering the deplorable state of Slavonia after the liberation from the Ottomans, Relković is, bearing in mind general backwardness of the area, extremely versatile and prolific writer. This Slavonian polymath has left indelible marks on Croatian philology, literature and general culture. Of course, almost all of his works are now only of historical interest (he possessed no authentic literary talent, nor even ambition), but, they have become so integrated in Austrohungary general culture that further generations of writers and philologists frequently adopted many Relković&#x27;s idioms and phrases without even being conscious of it. His popular dithyrambic verses on Slavonia are, in a way, the region&#x27;s motto.

Relković wrote numerous works, among which the following should be mentioned: 
* &quot;Nova slavonska i nimačka gramatika&quot;/New Slavonian and German grammar, published posthumously in 1860s
* &quot;Nek je svašta iliti sabranje pametnih ričih&quot;/Collection of wise adages, 1795, a hybrid polygraphy of aphorisms, mainly in the spirit of Rationalism and didacticism
* &quot;Satir iliti divji čovik&quot;/Satir or savage man, 1762, extended edition 1779, his most famous work, one of the Croatian Enlightenment bestsellers

His &quot;Satir&quot; is a patchwork of didactic poetry, prose, quasi-dramatic dialogues, soaked in common sense wisdom of Enlightenment and consisting mainly of pragmatic counsels on agriculture, small manufacture and, the most amusing part for the contemporary reader — sexual and behavioral codes of inhabitants of Slavonia which survived the Turkish expulsion and which were, as a sign of &quot;Oriental&quot; sensualism and dissoluteness, particularly abhorrent to the Rationalist moralist Relković. However — one must not be too severe in criticism of Relković&#x27;s reforming zeal, since the general state of affairs in Slavonia was at so low a level that his outrage was in many ways justified.

== Legacy ==
Relković&#x27;s enduring legacy is, even more than in the content of his didactic epic, contained in his linguistic idiom and grammatical and philological works (which, by the way, his son continued). Having spread neo-štokavian idiom in the second half of the 18th century, he is, along with Adam Tadije Blagojević and Andrija Kačić Miošić, a Dalmatian friar, considered to be one of the most decisive influences that helped shape Croatian standard language. Although modern Croatian linguists sometimes squabble about the range and actual value of his opus (some are of the opinion that Croatian owes more to the period of Baroque Slavism in early 17th century (with central authors like Bartol Kašić, Jakov Mikalja and Ivan Gundulić), or to the Ragusan writers of the late 15th century/early 16th century- crucial writers being Džore Držić and Šiško Menčetić) — no one denies Relković&#x27;s popular appeal that was, at least, the final touch that helped neo-štokavian dialect prevail as the basis of Croatian. Matija Antun Reljković Gymnasium, university preparatory high school in Vinkovci, is named after him since 1966.

<text>The Loser&#x27;s Lounge is an ongoing tribute project in New York City which performs music by songwriters and bands like Queen, Neil Diamond, Paul Williams, Elvis Costello, Serge Gainsbourg, The Beach Boys, Lee Hazlewood, Paul McCartney, XTC, and David Bowie. Each show explores greater- and lesser-known works by a single artist, or pits two musical forces against one another (for example, Blondie vs. The Pretenders, or The Smiths vs. The Cure).

The Loser&#x27;s Lounge is a popular forum that brings together New York City musicians of all stripes and genres—from successful mainstream singers to underground or experimental artists. Artists who have performed at Loser&#x27;s Lounge shows include Paul Williams, J Mascis, Sean Altman, John Flansburgh, April March, Ronnie Spector, Debbie Harry, Alice Cohen, Richard Barone, J. G. Thirlwell, Brian Dewan, Carol Jacobanis, and Cyndi Lauper.

==History==

The original revue was created in 1993 and performed by Joe McGinty (former keyboardist for the Psychedelic Furs and session musician for bands like The Ramones) with the performer Nick Danger and the singer/songwriter Andrea Egert. Its first performances were at the Pink Pony, on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side of New York City. Later performances at Fez under Time Cafe were backed by guitarist David Terhune&#x27;s The Kustard Kings, members of which — including Terhune, guitarist Julian Maile, drummer Clem Waldmen, percussionist Eddie Zweiback, and bassist Jeremy Chatzky — continue to perform as regulars for the Loser&#x27;s Lounge with McGinty and regular back-up singers Connie Petruk, Tricia Scotti, Sean Altman, and Katia Floreska.

For many years Fez under Time Cafe was home to regular Loser&#x27;s Lounge performances. The Fez closed as a venue in April, 2005, and since the revue has continued to perform bi-monthly at Joe&#x27;s Pub. The Loser&#x27;s Lounge has additionally appeared at several large rooms in New York City, including the Allen Room at AOL Time Warner Center and the Bowery Ballroom, as well as out-of-state venues like MASS MoCA. The group has played at notable New York musical events including Midsummer Night Swing at Lincoln Center and Celebrate Brooklyn.

<doc id="1118642" wikidata="Q1937755" url="?curid=1118642" title="Verdicchio">
<text>Verdicchio (, , ) is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Marche region of central Italy. The name &quot;Verdicchio&quot; derives from &quot;verde&quot; (or &quot;green&quot;) and refers to the slight green/yellow hue that wines made from the grape can have.

Verdicchio is the principal grape behind two &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) wines produced in the provinces of Macerata and Ancona, Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. In addition to producing still wines, Verdicchio grapes are also used to make sparkling wine and straw wine.

==History==
Verdicchio has had a long history in the Marche region of central Italy with documents noting its presence there since at least the 14th century. Despite its sensitivity to climate conditions and propensity to produce variable yields of variable quality wine, Verdicchio was a very popular planting in central Italy with an estimated 65,000 hectares planted in the mid-1980s. These figures made Verdicchio the 15th most planted variety of any grape in the world, ahead of well-known varieties like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Sangiovese.

While ampelographers believe that Verdicchio is probably indigenous to the Marche, there appears to be a genetic relation to Trebbiano and Greco grape varieties. In particular, the clones of Trebbiano grown in Lombardy and Soave show very close similarities to Verdicchio while genetic evidence has shown that Greco was probably an ancestor vine to nearly all of Italy&#x27;s native white grape varieties.

==Wine regions==

While Verdicchio is widely grown throughout the Marche, Umbria and Lazio regions, it is most often encountered in the DOC wines of Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. Castelli di Jesi, located around the commune of Iesi in the Ancona province, is the larger of the two areas and tends to produce a higher volume of wine. In Matelica, located in the nearby province of Macerata, the yields for Verdicchio are more restricted under DOC regulation with the best vineyard locations situated along hillsides of the Esino Valley.

===DOC regions===
The following is a list of DOCs that include Verdicchio as a permitted grape variety, along with other grapes that may be included in the blend in varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label. The wines for which Verdicchio must account for a majority of the blend are in bold.

*Cerveteri DOC (Lazio) – primarily Trebbiano, Romagnolo, Moscato Giallo and Malvasia with up to 15% of Verdicchio permitted along with Friulano, Bellone and/or Bombino.
*Circeo DOC (Lazio) – primarily Trebbiano with up to 15% of Verdicchio permitted along with other local white varieties.
*Colli Maceratesi DOC (Marche) – primarily Maceratino with up to 30% of Verdicchio permitted along with Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Incrocio Bruni, Pecorino (grape), Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto. In addition to the still wine, Verdicchio is permitted in the blend of the &quot;spumante&quot; and &quot;passito&quot; wines as well.
*Colli Martani DOC (Umbria) – primarily Trebbiano and/or Grechetto with up to 15% of Verdicchio permitted in these varietally labeled wines along with Garganega and Malvasia.
*Colli Perugini DOC (Umbria) – primarily Trebbiano with between 15 and 35% of Verdicchio and/or Grechetto and Garganega.
*Colli Pesaresi DOC (Marche) – can be made primarily of Verdicchio but can also be blended with Biancame, Pinot gris, Pinot noir (w/o any maceration prior to fermentation), Riesling Italico, Sauvignon blanc, Pinot blanc, Chardonnay and Trebbiano.
*Colli del Trasimeno DOC (Umbria) – primarily Trebbiano with up to 40% of Verdicchio permitted along with Verdello, Malvasia and Grechetto.
*Controguerra DOC – primarily Trebbiano and Passerina with up to 25% of Verdicchio permitted along with other local white varieties. In the sparkling &quot;spumante&quot;, Verdicchio, Pecorino and Chardonnay are blended with Trebbiano.
*Esino DOC (Marche) – 50–100% Verdicchio with other local white varieties permitted up to 50%.
*Falerio dei Colli Ascolani DOC (Marche) – primarily Trebbiano with up to 15% of Verdicchio permitted along with Passerina, Malvasia, Pinot blanc and Pecorino.
*Lacrima di Morro d&#x27;Alba DOC (Marche) – primarily Lacrima (grape), a red wine, with up to 15% of Verdicchio permitted.
*Marino DOC (Lazio) – primarily Malvasia and Trebbiano with up to 10% of Verdicchio permitted along with other local white varieties.
*Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi DOC (Marche) – a minimum of 85% Verdicchio with Trebbiano and Malvasia permitted to fill in the remaining portions of wine. In addition to a still version both a sparkling &quot;spumante&quot; and sweet &quot;passito&quot; style are produced in the DOC from Verdicchio.
*Verdicchio di Matelica DOC (Marche) – a minimum of 85% Verdicchio with Trebbiano and Malvasia permitted to fill in the remaining portions of wine. In addition to a still version a &quot;spumante&quot; and a &quot;passito&quot; style are produced in the DOC from Verdicchio.

==Wine styles==

Verdicchio can produce wines that are virtually colorless with noticeably high acidity that can come across on the palate with citrus notes. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, well made examples from favorable vintages can have flavors of lemons and slight bitter almond notes. Robinson also notes that the naturally high acidity of the grape makes it a good base &quot;cuvée&quot; variety for producing sparkling wine.

According to Oz Clarke, the quality of Verdicchio wines has improved since the later half of the 20th century as producers limit yields even beyond DOC regulation to produce fuller flavored grapes that can better balance its high acidity. Clarke goes on to note that the subtlety of Verdicchio flavors allows it to pair very well with a variety of foods.

==Clonal variation and plantings==

The Verdicchio grapevine is very susceptible to clonal mutations with several sub-varieties of the grape known to exist in central Italy under various synonyms (see section below). Like with many varieties of Italian wine grapes, this makes an exact cataloging of the number of plantings difficult. In her book, &quot;Jancis Robinson&#x27;s Guide to Wine Grapes&quot;, Robinson reports in 1996 that there were nearly of Verdicchio found mostly in the provinces along the Adriatic coast. That number is dramatically reduced from the number of plantings of Verdicchio in the mid-1980s when there was an estimated 65,000 hectares (all in Italy). However, some wine experts, including Jancis Robinson, speculate that it is likely that some of those plantings were actually Trebbiano.

<text>Little Computer People, also called House-on-a-Disk, is a social simulation game released in 1985 by Activision for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Apple II. An Amiga version was released in 1987. Two Japanese versions were also released in 1987, a Family Computer Disk System version, published in Japan by Disk Original Group (DOG) a subsidiary of Square, and a PC-8801 version.

==Gameplay==
The game has no win conditions, and one setting: a sideways view of the inside of a three-story house. After a short time, an animated character will move in and occupy the house. He goes about a daily routine, doing everyday things like cooking, watching television or reading the newspaper. Players are able to interact with this person in various ways, including entering simple commands for the character to perform, playing a game of poker with him and offering presents. On occasion, the character initiates contact on his own, inviting the player to a game or writing a letter explaining his feelings and needs. Each copy of the game generates its own unique character, so no two copies play exactly the same. The character&#x27;s name is randomly selected from a list of 256 names.

The documentation accompanying the game fully keeps up the pretense of the &quot;little people&quot; being real, and living inside one&#x27;s computer (the software merely &quot;bringing them out&quot;), with the player as their caretaker.

Two versions of the game exist for the Commodore 64: the disk version, which plays as described above, and the cassette version, which omits several features. On tape versions, the Little Computer Person is generated from scratch every time the game is started up (not only on the first boot, as with other versions), and thus does not go through the &quot;moving in&quot; sequence seen on other versions. Also, on cassette versions the Computer Person has no memory, and does not communicate meaningfully with the user, and the card games, such as poker, cannot be played.

==Development==
The initial idea for &quot;Little Computer People&quot; was developed by Rich Gold, who wanted to create a Pet Person computer program similar to that of the Pet Rock toys of the 1970s. Gold was able to develop some funding for it and hired James Wickstead Design Associates to realize it as a game concept which was in development for about a year. This team refined the concept of a Pet Person who lived in a house. Gold initially struggled to find a publisher for the product. At this point, the game was like screensaver, that the players would be able to boot and just see what the character was doing. Gold met with Activision president Jim Levy was an interesting enough product to show to game developer David Crane, who had popular hits with games like &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (1982) and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) for his opinion. At this point in time, Activision was one of the largest video game publishers in the industry. Crane said he offered to take on the project, but not as a finished game for publishing but as a starting point for an interactive product. Crane saw the project as going beyond the Pet rock concept in what Crane described as &quot;one of the hardest programming challenges of my career.&quot; Crane wanted to add interactivity and argued with Gold with this concept, who said it was contrary to the initial Pet Rock concept. Crane later recalled in 2005 that &quot;Part of me wanted to make him the smartest thing in computing maybe even to pass the Turing test — but with the constraints of time in the software business that was impractical.&quot; Including the development of James Wickstead Design Associates, the game took about two years to develop in a period when most games were developed in four to five months. 

Crane made the game so that each copy of it would be unique. Each copy of the game had built in parameters that gave the character a unique personality and mood parameters. He stated that this turned out to be one of the important aspects of the game as based on his personality and mood, the character could opt to ignore your commands.
While the game has the character live off a real-time six hour game schedule for a day, Crane thought it may have been better to have the character live off of a real-time schedule such as booting the game up at night would have the character sleeping. 

Playing cards with the character was almost not included due to a lack of time according to Crane, who said that nearly all the time was focused on giving the character interactivity with its basic brain. Steve Cartwright was between games when the development of &quot;Little Computer People&quot; was closing, with Crane giving Cartwright the parameters to include the card game feature. Marketing staff at Activision formulated promotion through a newspaper story about the discovery of people living in computers everywhere.

==Release==
The game was first released for the Commodore 64 and later for the Amiga computers in 1987. as well as the Apple II, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum.

The game was re-released on the Activision C64 15 Pack for PC. This version allowed the player to generate a new person if the character died off somehow. Initial ideas for expansion included friends visiting and new housing.

===Ports===
 is a port of &quot;Little Computer People&quot; to the Family Computer Disk System. The port was released by Square in 1987. Unlike previous versions of &quot;Little Computer People&quot;, the playable character is a girl wearing a pink dress and bow in her hair. The rooms of the house are also in a different configuration, featuring an outdoor balcony on the top floor. When the game is first played, a name for the character is chosen at random from a preprogrammed list. &quot;Apple Town Story&quot; lacks many of the features found in other versions of &quot;Little Computer People&quot;. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was written by Nobuo Uematsu, who would later become recognized for his work in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

In December 1987, a second Japanese version of the game was released for the PC-8801 computer, titled &quot;Little Computer People&quot; (リトルコンピュータピープル). Like Apple Town Story, this game also features a female character, only older and more glamorous in appearance. Aside from the character, this version of the game is far more like the original in all other respects.

==Reception==

Roy Wagner reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;The game is more cute than fun or challenging. The range of activities are limited and not very exciting, but can be interesting. The &#x27;game&#x27; is ideally suited for children. It does a good job of teaching about caring for another.&quot;

&quot;Little Computer People&quot; earned a &quot;Zzap!64&quot; Gold Medal Award in 1985. &quot;Games&quot; magazine listed it as one of its top 10 best entertainment software produced in 1985. Jerry Pournelle of &quot;BYTE&quot; named it his game of the month for December 1986, stating &quot;That&#x27;s not strictly a game, but it sure has consumed all the game time we have around here&quot; and that the Amiga version&#x27;s graphics were preferable to the Atari ST&#x27;s.

&quot;Compute!&quot; favorably reviewed the Atari ST version in 1987, stating that it had &quot;enormous and subtle educational appeal&quot; to children and others. The magazine concluded that &quot;Little Computer People&quot; &quot;is a delightful program&quot;. The game was voted best original game of the year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.

==Legacy==
&quot;Little Computer People&quot; was described by Kim Wild of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; as &quot;selling well enough&quot;, but that the large amount of money in development and acquiring the property mean that any sequels were not a financial reality. During the development of the Amiga version of the game, Crane was planning add-ons being made available.

&quot;Little Computer People&quot; is often compared to an early predecessor to &quot;The Sims&quot; game series. When asked about its influence, Crane responded that &quot;Almost everything we touched in those days could be constructed as the precursor to something on the market today. So rather than go there, I simple acknowledge that I took the first baby steps toward the simulation genre when I added human-like interactivity to &quot;Little Computer People&quot;.&quot;
Will Wright, designer of &quot;The Sims&quot;, has mentioned playing &quot;Little Computer People&quot; and receiving valuable feedback on &quot;The Sims&quot; from its designer, Rich Gold.

In 1998, German electro musician Anthony Rother released a single titled &quot;Little Computer People&quot;, which is inspired by the computer game, as part of the group The Little Computer People Project.

<text>Brokat Technologies AG (formerly known as Brokat AG, Brokat Infosystems AG, and Brokat Informationssysteme GmbH), was established in 1994. During the period spanning from 1998 to 2001, it emerged as a prominent entity in the German stock market, particularly within the context of the New Economy and the New Market. However, its fortunes reversed with the collapse of the stock market dot-com bubble.

Specialising in the development of e-business solutions, Brokat was recognised as a key international player in Internet banking solutions by the year 2000. Central to its offerings was the Twister platform, a modular e-services framework. This platform facilitated the seamless integration of existing IT infrastructures and applications within businesses, securely linking them to diverse electronic channels such as the Internet and mobile communications.

== History ==
Brokat was initially established as Brokat Informationssysteme GmbH on October 21, 1994. It commenced its operations with a registered share capital of 158,300 Deutsche Marks (DM). The enterprise was conceived through the collaborative efforts of five individuals: Stefan Roever (1965–2019), whose educational background encompassed law and business administration; Boris Anderer (born 1958), holding a doctorate in physics; Achim Schlumpberger (born 1965), a qualified computer scientist; Michael Schumacher (born 1961), also a certified computer scientist; and Michael Janßen (born 1966), whose expertise lay in business economics. Initially headquartered in Böblingen, Germany, near Stuttgart, the company later relocated its central offices to Stuttgart-Vaihingen on January 15, 1998.

From 1996 to 2000 Brokat Technologies (formerly listed at the NASDAQ and the German Neuer Markt) was one of the German fast-growing companies of the New Economy age. In November 2001, it declared insolvency during the bust of dot-com bubble.

Brokat&#x27;s product families multi-channel infrastructure software, rules management and personalization technology, mobile payment software, and e-finance applications were used by over 3,500 enterprises worldwide including Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro, Allianz, Atlantic Data Services Inc., Bank of America, Blue Martini Software, Charter One, DaimlerChrysler, DBS Bank, Fidelity Investments, IBM Corporation, LBBW, MasterCard International, SE-Banken, Sun Microsystems, Swiss Post, T-Motion (a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom), and Toyota. Strategic partners, among others, included Compaq, Intel, IBM, Siemens, and Sun Microsystems. With dual headquarters in San Jose, California and Stuttgart, Germany, Brokat employed over 1,400 people in 17 countries.

When Brokat went public in 1998, Stefan Roever became CEO together with Boris Anderer as Co-CEO. Michael Janßen became CFO and Achim Schlumpberger became CTO. In 1999, Anderer and Schlumpberger quit their Executive positions; Anderer became Chairman of Brokat working on the US expansion and Schlumpberger became Chief Architect of Brokat core technology. Both left the company end of 2000.

In 1998, Brokat went public at the German &quot;Neuer Markt&quot;. In 1999, Brokat entered the U.S. market by acquiring the Atlanta-based Transaction Software Technologies, Inc. (TST). Furthermore, Intel invested 10M EUR in Brokat.

End of 1999, Brokat achieved a market capitalization of more than $5 Billion. In 2000, Brokat expanded in the U.S. market by acquiring Gemstone Systems, Inc., Blaze Software, Inc. and Automated Financial Systems. Furthermore, Siemens invested 73M EUR in Brokat. In spring 2000, Brokat also issued a high-yield bond of €125 million led by the West LB bank.

In November 2001, Brokat declared bankruptcy after it was unable to negotiate a restructuring agreement with the creditors of the high yield bond. During the liquidation, the e-payment engineering core was acquired by eOne Global (a First Data company) and maintained as a legal entity called Encorus Technology. The name Encorus was developed by WildOutWest and derives its meaning from Latin etymology &quot;All together&quot; with the goal to establish a standard for wireless/ mobile payments. Encorus focused on software and professional services for the &quot;mobile payment&quot; business (payment by the means of mobile phones). In 2005 the Encorus business was acquired by Qpass.

The Professional Services department and the rest of Brokat was bought by Brokat&#x27;s longtime opponent in the German market, Data Design AG in 2001. In 2003, Data Design was finally acquired by the Hungarian Interactive Net Design (IND).

==Technology==
Brokat developed mostly banking-related software and provided professional services mainly to financial institutions. Brokat was known for its encryption server and applet technology named XPresso, which made strong encryption (128bit symmetric) available without US (especially NSA) interference. Brokat sold its software to many large financial institutions mainly in Europe, especially Germany.

In addition to providing systems to established institutions, Brokat also created solutions for startup companies. A prominent example for the latter is Cortal Consors.
The company tried to get in the middleware software business by developing the application server Twister. Twister was the base technology for nearly all customized solutions implemented by Brokat.

===Twister===
Twister was the main product of Brokat AG. It was a proprietary middleware software that was created in the late 1990s and was always sold as the central software product in all projects. The software was mainly sold to financial institutions which often also relied on the &quot;XPresso&quot; encryption software of Brokat.

The base of Twister was a CORBA Object Request Broker written in C++ that handled requests from so-called &quot;Gateway&quot;s and routed them to so-called &quot;RDO&quot;s. RDOs are comparable to the more modern EJB JavaBeans (server software objects). Backend systems such as legacy mainframe applications or database servers were accessed through so-called &quot;Accessors&quot;.
RDOs could be written in TCL, Java or C++ and interact with each other regardless of the language. Despite this cross-language functionality, most projects were implemented in a single language, most often TCL or java.

Twister 4 also supported the EJB java object model.

Twister was capable of handling very high loads and was thus used by electronic stock traders like &quot;Cortal Consors&quot; for real-time trading. During the morning hours when the stock exchange opened, the Twister System at Consors was known to handle several thousand connections/requests simultaneously.

===Innovations===
Brokat was a pioneer in encryption technology by providing a java-Applet-based encryption toolkit, named Xpresso. The protocol of this toolkit was named SRT (Secure Request Technology). Technically, it was a 128bit-key implementation of the SSL protocol.

In the final years, Brokat refocused on Mobile Commerce, which is defined as electronic commerce done on mobile devices such as Smartphones. This led to a technology called Mobile Digital Signature, an XML-based message format for encoding and signing business contracts.

For the implementation of business logic, the company devised a very simple object model, called RDO (repository defined object). RDOs had a very simple interface structure, consisting of a flat key-value structure. RDOs could be written in many programming languages and would interoperate easily.

Brokat was awarded several patents on encryption technology (e.g. random number generators) and for the RDO cross-language programming model.

<doc id="1118651" wikidata="Q1298380" url="?curid=1118651" title="Sports science">
<text>Sports science is a discipline that studies how the healthy human body works during exercise, and how sports and physical activity promote health and performance from cellular to whole body perspectives. The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of physiology (exercise physiology), psychology (sport psychology), anatomy, biomechanics (sports biomechanics), biochemistry, and kinesiology. 

Sport scientists and performance consultants are growing in demand and employment numbers, with the ever-increasing focus within the sporting world on achieving the best results possible. Through the scientific study of sports, researchers have developed a greater understanding of how the human body reacts to exercise, training, different environments, and many other stimuli.

== Origins of exercise physiology ==
Sports science can trace its origins back to Ancient Greece. The noted ancient Greek physician Galen (131–201) wrote 87 detailed essays about improving health (proper nutrition), aerobic fitness, and strengthening muscles.

New ideas upon the working and functioning of the human body emerged during the Renaissance as anatomists and physicians challenged the previously known theories. These spread with the implementation of the printed word, the result of Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press in the 15th century. Allied with this was a large increase in academia in general, universities were forming all around the world. Importantly, these new scholars went beyond the simplistic notions of the early Greek physicians, and shed light upon the complexities of the circulatory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, by the middle of the 19th century, early medical schools (such as the Harvard Medical School, formed 1782) began appearing in the United States, whose graduates went on to assume positions of importance in academia and allied medical research.

Medical journal publications increased significantly in number during this period. In 1898, three articles on physical activity appeared in the first volume of the &quot; American Journal of Physiology&quot;. Other articles and reviews subsequently appeared in prestigious journals. The German applied physiology publication, &quot;Internationale Zeitschrift fur Physiologie einschliesslich Arbeitphysiologie &quot; (1929–1940; now known as the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology), became a significant journal in the field of research.

A number of key figures have made significant contributions to the study of sports science: 
* Austin Flint, Jr., (1836–1915) One of the first American pioneer physicians, studied physiological responses to exercise in his influential medical textbooks.
* Edward Hitchcock, Jr., (1828–1911) Amherst College Professor of Hygiene and Physical Education, devoted his academic career to the scientific study of physical exercise, training, and the body. Coauthored 1860 text on exercise physiology.
* George Wells Fitz, M.D. (1860–1934) Created the first departmental major in Anatomy, Physiology, and Physical Training at Harvard University in 1891.
* August Krogh (1874–1949) Won the 1920 Nobel Prize in physiology for discovering the mechanism that controlled capillary blood flow in resting or active muscle.
* Per-Olof Åstrand (1922–2015) Professor at the Department of Physiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Wrote a seminal paper which evaluated the physical working capacity of men and women aged 4–33 years.

== Study of sports science ==
A notable amount of research in the field of sports science is completed at universities or dedicated research centers. Higher-education degrees in Sports Science or Human Physiology are also becoming increasingly popular, with many universities now offering both undergraduate, postgraduate and distance learning degrees in the discipline. Opportunities for graduates in these fields include employment as a Physical Education teacher, Dietician or Nutritionist, Performance Analyst, Sports coach, Sports therapist, Fitness center manager, Sports administrator, Strength and Conditioning specialist, or retail manager of a sports store. Graduates may also be well-positioned to undertake further training to become an accredited Physiotherapist, Exercise Physiologist, Research Scientist and Sports Medical Doctor.

Sports science may also be useful for providing information on the aging body. Older adults are aware of the benefits of exercise, but many are not performing the exercise needed to maintain these benefits. Sports science provides a means of allowing older people to regain more physical competence without focusing on doing so for the purposes of anti-aging. Sports science can also provide a means of helping older people avoid falls and have the ability to perform daily tasks more independently.

In Australia, the majority of sports science research from 1983 to 2003 was done in laboratories and nearly half of the research was done with sub-elite or elite athletes. Over two-thirds of the research was done regarding four sports: rowing, cycling, athletics, and swimming. In America, sports play a big part of the American identity, however, sports science has slowly been replaced with exercise science. Sports science can allow athletes to train and compete more effectively at home and abroad.

José Mourinho, a football manager who won UEFA Champions League twice, reflected his studies of sport science as &quot;sometimes it is difficult to understand if it is sport or if it is science&quot;.

== Academic journals in sports science ==
* &quot;Journal of Applied Biomechanics&quot;
* &quot;International Journal of Computer Science in Sport&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Swimming Research&quot;
* &quot;Sports&quot;
* &quot;Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport&quot;

==Reproducibility==
A 2018 study criticized the field of exercise and sports science for insufficient replication studies, limited reporting of both null and trivial results, and insufficient research transparency. Statisticians have criticized sports science for common use of magnitude-based inference, a controversial statistical method which has allowed sports scientists to extract apparently significant results from noisy data where ordinary hypothesis testing would have found none.

<doc id="1118652" wikidata="Q6313467" url="?curid=1118652" title="Junior State of America">
<text>The Junior State of America (formerly the Junior Statesmen of America), abbreviated JSA, was an American non-partisan youth organization. The purpose of JSA was to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA was sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a 501c(3) non-profit corporation), which also operated the JSA Summer Schools. On August 2nd, 2024, it was announced that the organization would be closing and ceasing operations on August 31, 2024. In response, a new organization named Civic Leaders of America was formed by former JSA students on August 10, 2024. 

== Overview ==

As a student run organization, students managed every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level. The members elected local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events.

As an organization, JSA was organized by regions congruous with the geographic regions of the United States. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organized local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organized regional one-day conferences. On the state level, Student governors and lieutenant governors organize overnight conventions and other activities. On the national level, governors were in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization.

The JSA program included debates, &quot;thought talks,&quot; problem solving, and a variety of simulations designed to provide members with an informed viewpoint and the ability to analyze important issues. Simulations include, for example, writing mocked legislation, debating and voting on it, Model Congress (with a Senate and House of Representatives), crisis simulations, and other activities. JSA provided an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who shared similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually included various evening activities like dining downtown or impromptu debate.

In addition to the school year program, JSA held multiple one to three week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students. These were held at multiple locations across the nation including Stanford and Georgetown, and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states. (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at Yale, Northwestern University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California, Davis, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Princeton). Sessions include college-level courses on political science, economics, history and public speaking. Students from all over the world, (most notably England, France, Turkey, Micronesia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hong Kong) attend Summer School. The revenue from these programs helped fund the school-year JSA program.

== History ==
JSA was founded in 1934 by Professor E. A. Rogers at the Montezuma Mountain School in Los Gatos, California, as an experiment in self-government. Students at the Montezuma Mountain School set up their own three-branch government, complete with a student court, police force, executive officer, and legislative branch. The students would draft, pass, and enforce their own rules.

The JSA has had liaisons with other similar organizations outside of the United States. For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the British Columbia Youth Parliament (BCYP). The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school&#x27;s chapter attended the annual Congress convention. There are two active chapters in St. Kitts and St. Thomas, USVI. Puerto Rico has traditionally one or two chapters. All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions.

Since its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.

JSA closed down on August 31st 2024. The reasons cited for closure included reduced student participation and increasing costs
=== Notable alumni ===
Notable former members include Leon Panetta (Former Secretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, White House Chief of Staff, United States Congressman, and Member of the California State Senate), Mike McCurry (Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton), Edwin Meese (Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan), Jennifer Palmieri (White House Communication Director under President Barack Obama) businessman and inventor Charles R. Schwab, and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. There are also 3 current JSA alumni serving in Congress: Mark Takano, Derek Kilmer, and Zoe Lofgren.

== Structure ==

The JSA consisted of 10 states which correspond roughly to the geographic territories in the United States: the Arizona State, Mid-Atlantic State, Midwest State, Northeast State, Northern California State, Ohio River Valley State, Pacific Northwest State, Southeast State, Southern California State, and the Texas State. Each state was broken into one or more regions. If a state contracts below a certain operational level, the Council of Governors may vote to make the state a territory. The Council may also break states into multiple territories if they become too large to be effectively managed.

The sponsoring JSAF was a non-profit organization with an adult board of directors, trustees and paid staff. The JSA receives administrative and programming support from the JSF.

===Mid-Atlantic State===

The Mid-Atlantic State was composed of chapters from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and North Carolina. The Mid-Atlantic State was divided into the New Jersey Region (NJ) and the South Atlantic District (PA, MD, DE, VA, NC). The New Jersey Region was the most populated JSA region in the nation. Winter Congress was held in Arlington, Virginia, while the Spring and Fall State Conventions rotate between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Woodbridge, New Jersey.

The Mid-Atlantic state had the largest number of voters in its 2024 election with over 12,000 participants. The MAS also set recent records for most delegates in a Fall State, Winter Congress, and Spring State Conventions.

== JSA events ==
=== Fall and Spring State conventions ===
 Fall State and Spring State are statewide overnight conventions at regional hotels and convention centers. Both consist of debates, thought talks, and special activities, including political fairs and a casual dance. Fall State was one night, students typically arrive at the hotel on a Saturday and return home the following day. Spring State, by comparison, usually takes place over three days, students arriving at the hotel on a Friday and returning on Sunday. At this longer spring convention JSA members in attendance elect regional leaders for the upcoming year. Both Fall and Spring State conventions are highlighted by prestigious keynote speakers, with past speakers including Pat Robertson, Ralph Nader, Colin Powell, Jahana Hayes, Tom Malinowski, Fareed Zakaria and Joe Trippi.

=== Winter Congress convention ===
Winter Congress was structured similar to the United States Congress: students are divided into Senate and House of Representative committees. Student delegates pass bills in committees and then in floor sessions of the Senate and House. If a bill passes both houses, it becomes JSA law.

=== Regional conferences ===
There are also smaller, regional conferences and chapter-conferences (&quot;chapter-cons&quot;) which occur on a local level. Regionals are run by the Mayors and Vice-Mayors of Regions along with the Regional Cabinet members that they appoint. Chapter-cons are usually hosted by chapters at individual schools and are not officially JSA-sponsored events.

== Elected positions and cabinet ==
As a student-run organization, each JSA state holds elections yearly at the Spring State conventions to elect student elected officials who serve one-year terms. Each state elects a Governor and Lieutenant Governor, as well as various other offices that differ from state to state. These officials each appoint a small cabinet that helps them run the organization by completing tasks such as organizing convention logistics, writing debates, producing publicity materials, founding new chapters, and running websites. There was also a National Cabinet appointed by the Council of Governors. JSA officials and cabinet members are typically extremely dedicated to JSA, and often spend many hours per week doing their jobs.

== Summer programs ==
After the school year was over, JSA and JSF offer numerous summer programs. The biggest programs, which are held at major universities, are Summer Schools, which are conducted by the Junior Statesmen Foundation and offer students an opportunity to study local, state, or national government at an advanced level. These programs are meant to prepare young leaders for active participation in public affairs.

These programs, at which students take a full semester of two courses over three or four weeks, for which they can receive high school credit, take place at Stanford, Georgetown, Princeton, and Beijing. Along with debate and regular classes (including Advanced Placement and Law Classes), students participate in a vigorous Speaker&#x27;s Program in which notable speakers talk about current issues to the students. Past speakers have included Mike McCurry, Andy Card, Ben Bernanke, Lee H. Hamilton, Norman Mineta, Joe Trippi, Dennis Kucinich, Chuck Hagel, Katie Couric, Brian Williams, Geraldine Ferraro, John Kerry, Harry Reid, Barack Obama, Ted Rall, George H. W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Ed Meese, Bernie Sanders, Brian Williams, Karl Rove, Sebastian Gorka, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Summer institutes are also held in different regions, such as the summer symposium of Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA, Princeton University and University of Texas. These events are four- to five-days long and venture into politics, world studies, history, national security and discussions of current events. Princeton&#x27;s event was nicknamed &quot;Princetitute.&quot; These events used to be known as symposia.

Every summer, the newly elected governors each choose a select few from their states or territories to attend the Montezuma National Leadership Summit (affectionately known as &quot;Zuma&quot;). The summit was held in early-to-mid August at Presentation Center in Los Gatos, California, the former site of the Montezuma Mountain School where JSA was founded in 1934. Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance was considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State. Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.

<doc id="1118654" wikidata="Q1547127" url="?curid=1118654" title="The Yes Men">
<text>The Yes Men are a culture jamming activist duo and network of supporters created by Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos. Through various actions, the Yes Men primarily aim to raise awareness about problematic social and political issues. To date, the duo have produced three films: &quot;The Yes Men&quot; (2003), &quot;The Yes Men Fix the World&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Yes Men Are Revolting&quot; (2014). In these films, they impersonate entities that they dislike, a practice that they call &quot;identity correction.&quot; The Yes Men operate under the mission statement that lies can expose truth. They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have led to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations. They espouse the belief that corporations and governmental organizations often act in dehumanizing ways toward the public. Elaborate props are sometimes part of the ruse (e.g. Survivaball), as shown in their 2003 DVD release &quot;The Yes Men&quot;. The Yes Men have collaborated with other groups of similar interest, including Improv Everywhere, Andrew Boyd and Steve Lambert.

== Background ==
According to Servin, the Yes Men concept initially sprang from their creation of a fake website spoofing the World Trade Organization. To the surprise of Servin and Vamos, many believed the site to be authentic, and the two were consequently contacted to speak at a conference in Austria. Since this time, the Yes Men have continued performing large-scale hoaxes, in what they describe as a collaborative effort with journalists to help the media tell stories which they believe are important.

The Yes Men often deploy a satirical approach: they pose as a powerful entity (typically a corporate or government representative or executive) and make ridiculous and shocking comments that caricature the ideological position of the organization or person. Furthermore, they acknowledge the idea that many corporate or government entities manipulate their ideology using spin; in response, the Yes Men use this power of spin to their own advantage, and use media outlets to disseminate their personal interpretation of the situation. A sense of humor and shock value is usually employed to make these issues more palatable to the general public and to call greater media attention to stories of interest. Some of these outrageous ideas include the prospect of selling one&#x27;s vote or a proposition that the poor should consume recycled human waste. On most occasions, little to no shock or outrage is publicly evoked in response to their prank.

On occasion, the Yes Men&#x27;s phony spokesperson will make announcements that represent fictitious scenarios for the anti-globalization movement or opponents of corporate crime. This has often resulted in false news reports, such as those covering the demise of the World Trade Organization, or Dow Chemical paying compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster.

The Yes Men have posed as spokespeople for the WTO, McDonald&#x27;s, Dow Chemical, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The two leading members of the Yes Men are known by a number of aliases, most recently, and in film, Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno (Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, respectively). Servin is an author of experimental fiction, and was known for being the man who inserted images of men kissing in the computer game &quot;SimCopter&quot;. Vamos is an associate professor of media arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. They are assisted by numerous people across the globe. There are other full-time members, such as Whitney Black and Rocco Ferrer, who take a more behind-the-scenes approach.

Their experiences were documented in the film &quot;The Yes Men&quot;, distributed by United Artists, the film documentary &quot;info wars&quot;, and the book &quot;The Yes Men: The True Story of the End of the World Trade Organization&quot; (). Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno also directed a 2009 film entitled &quot;The Yes Men Fix the World&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2009 they launched their online video channel on Babelgum.

Their third film, &quot;The Yes Men Are Revolting&quot;, premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.

The Yes Men encourage activist and student groups to make their voices heard through crashing conferences, creating fake websites, and getting arrested.

== Projects ==
=== George W. Bush ===
One of the Yes Men&#x27;s first pranks was the satirical website codice_1, established for the 2000 US presidential election to draw attention to alleged hypocrisies on Bush&#x27;s actual website. When asked about the site in a press conference on May 21, 1999, Bush responded that the website had gone too far in criticizing him.

In 2004, the Yes Men went on tour posing as the group &quot;Yes, Bush Can!&quot; and encouraged supporters to sign a &quot;Patriot Pledge&quot; agreeing to keep nuclear waste in their back yards and send their children off to war. They appeared at the 2004 Republican National Convention and drove across the country at first in an RV with a George W. Bush body wrap, and then in a painted van.

==== Ice Age Petition ====
The Yes Men posed as working as part of the Bush-Cheney campaign. They carried around a petition asking for signatures to support global warming because America&#x27;s competing countries will suffer while America only bears minor side effects.

=== Dow Chemical ===
On December 3, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, Andy Bichlbaum appeared on BBC World as &quot;Jude Finisterra&quot;, a Dow Chemical spokesman. Dow is the owner of Union Carbide, the company responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India on December 3, 1984. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately from the hazardous chemicals and thousands more were killed by the plume from the UCC plant during the next few days. The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas, leading to numerous early and late health defects. The Bhopal Disaster became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe. Immediately after the disaster, UCC began attempts to dissociate itself from responsibility for the gas leak. The Indian Supreme Court eventually mediated a settlement in which UCC accepted moral responsibility and agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200. Warren M. Anderson, who led the Union Carbide during the Bhopal disaster of 1984, died in 2014 at the age of 92 after fleeing to the United States; his wife, Lillian, stated Anderson suffered &quot;25 years of unfair treatment.&quot;

On their fake Dow Chemical website, the Yes Men said that Dow Chemical Company had no intention whatsoever of repairing the damage. The real company received considerable backlash, and both the real Dow and the phony Dow denied the statements, but Dow took no real action.

The Yes Men decided to pressure Dow further, so as &quot;Finisterra,&quot; Bichlbaum went on the news to claim that Dow planned to liquidate Union Carbide and use the resulting $12 billion to pay for medical care, clean up the site, and fund research into the hazards of other Dow products. After two hours of wide coverage, Dow issued a press release denying the statement, stating that they had no employee by that name and he was an impostor, ensuring even greater coverage of the phony news of a cleanup. In Frankfurt, Dow&#x27;s share price fell 4.24 percent in 23 minutes, wiping $2 billion off its market value. The shares rebounded in Frankfurt after the BBC issued an on-air correction and apology. In New York, Dow Chemical&#x27;s stock were little changed because of the early trading.

After the original interview was revealed as a hoax, Bichlbaum appeared in a follow-up interview on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 news. During the interview he was asked if he had considered the emotions and reaction of the people of Bhopal when producing the hoax. According to the interviewer, &quot;there were many people in tears&quot; upon having learned of the hoax. Bichlbaum said that, in comparison, what distress he had caused the people was minimal to that for which Dow was responsible. The Yes Men claim on their website that they have been told by contacts in Bhopal that once they had got over their disappointment that it wasn&#x27;t real, they were pleased about the stunt and thought it had helped to raise awareness of their plight.

At the International Payments Conference on April 28, 2005, &#x27;Dow representative&#x27; &quot;Erastus Hamm&quot; unveiled Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable Risk mascot – a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda – to an audience of about 70 banking professionals.

In February 2012, it was widely reported in the 2012 Stratfor email leak that Dow Chemical Company hired private intelligence firm Stratfor to monitor the Yes Men.

=== WTO ===
One of the Yes Men&#x27;s most famous pranks is placing a &quot;corrected&quot; WTO website at https://www.gatt.org (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The fake site began to receive real emails from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite groups on behalf of the WTO, to which they responded as if they were the actual WTO. At the WTO, the Yes Men gave speeches encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from citizens. They then unveiled a gold spandex body suit that they said would allow productivity to increase, as managers would not have to oversee workers in person but could keep track of them via images on an attached screen as well as implanted sensors.

=== New Orleans and HUD ===

The Yes Men appeared on August 28, 2006, at a &quot;Housing Summit&quot; in New Orleans, taking the stage along with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Before an audience composed mostly of real estate developers, one of the Yes Men gave a speech in which he claimed to be Rene Oswin, a fictitious &quot;assistant under-secretary&quot; at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In his speech he claimed that HUD would reopen public housing facilities that had been closed since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. He announced this false claim because HUD had recently decided to only rebuild a third of the subsidized housing stock after Hurricane Katrina, and made plans to demolish four of New Orleans’ ten public housing developments, leaving thousands of New Orleans residents without homes. This decision was contested locally, nationally, and internationally. So, the Yes Men proclaimed that HUD had changed its mind about tearing down the undamaged housing units, and would not tear down the housing projects, as they had planned to do in order to replace them with mixed-income developments.

HUD called this prank, which was intended to bring attention to the lack of affordable housing, a &quot;cruel hoax&quot;. A former resident of the community was quoted by Bichlbaum as saying, &quot;do whatever&#x27;s most effective, do it, don&#x27;t worry about how it affects us,&quot; however. HUD spokeswoman Donna White said no one named &quot;Rene Oswin&quot; works for the department. White commented, &quot;I&#x27;m like, who the heck is that?&quot;

The fictitious Oswin also announced that the big oil companies would contribute some of their record profits to rebuild the wetlands destroyed by the construction of oil tanker canals to prevent the city from being inundated by future hurricanes.

=== ExxonMobil ===

On June 14, 2007, the Yes Men acted during Canada&#x27;s largest oil conference in Calgary, Alberta, posing as ExxonMobil and National Petroleum Council (NPC) representatives. In front of more than 300 oilmen, the NPC was expected to deliver the long-awaited conclusions of a study commissioned by U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond, who is also the chair of the study. When the Yes Men arrived at the conference they said that Lee Raymond (the promised speaker) was unable to make it due to a pressing situation with the president. The Yes Men then went on to give a presentation in place of Lee Raymond.

In the actual speech, the &quot;NPC rep&quot; announced that current U.S. and Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive processing of Alberta&#x27;s oil sands, and the development of liquid coal) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he reassured the audience that in the worst-case scenario, the oil industry could &quot;keep fuel flowing&quot; by transforming the billions of people who would die into oil.

The project, called Vivoleum, would work in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production. The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit &quot;commemorative candles&quot;. At this point, event security recognized the Yes Men and forced them off stage, and the &#x27;punchline&#x27; – that the candles were made of Vivoleum obtained from the flesh of an &quot;Exxon janitor&quot; who died as a result of cleaning up a toxic spill – was not delivered to the audience, but only to reporters.

=== &quot;New York Times&quot; ===
The Yes Men (along with the Anti-Advertising Agency) also claimed partial responsibility for a prank on November 12, 2008, where approximately 80,000 copies of a fake edition of the July 4, 2009 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; were handed out on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. The fake edition shows their ideas for a better future with headlines such as &quot;Iraq War Ends&quot; and &quot;Nation Sets Its Sights on Building Sane Economy&quot;. The front page contained a spoofed motto, &quot;All the News We Hope to Print&quot; from the famous phrase &quot;All the news that&#x27;s fit to print&quot;. Articles in the paper announce dozens of new initiatives, including an establishment of national health care, a maximum wage for C.E.O.s and an article wherein George W. Bush accuses himself of treason for his actions during his years as president. There is also a Reuters photo of the fake cover page and a fake website, http://www.nytimes-se.com/.

Alex S. Jones, a former &quot;Times&quot; reporter and media scholar, said of the paper, &quot;I would say if you’ve got one, hold on to it...it will probably be a collector&#x27;s item. I&#x27;m just glad someone thinks &quot;The New York Times&quot; print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax. A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier. But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations? That takes a lot of effort.&quot;

=== &quot;New York Post&quot; and SurvivaBall ===
On September 21, 2009, one day before a UN summit lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, over 2,000 volunteers distributed throughout New York City a 32-page &quot;special edition&quot; &quot;New York Post&quot;, blaring headlines (cover story &quot;We&#x27;re Screwed&quot;) that the city could face deadly heat waves, extreme flooding, and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades. The paper had been created by the Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake-up call to action on climate change. Other articles describe the Pentagon&#x27;s alarmed response to global warming, the U.S. government&#x27;s minuscule response, China&#x27;s advanced alternative energy program, and how the COP15 in Copenhagen could be a &quot;Flopenhagen&quot;. There is also a fake website. A &quot;climate change horoscope&quot; satire on the Sally Brompton horoscope in the Post was commissioned from an environmental activist horoscope writer but was not published.

On September 22, 2009, the Yes Men demonstrated, on the alleged behalf of Halliburton and dozens of other climate threatening corporations, an inflatable ball-shaped costume known as the SurvivaBall, claiming it was a self-contained living system for surviving disasters caused by global warming. Over two dozen people wore the SurvivaBall costumes as it was demonstrated in the East River. Police shut down the demonstration for lack of a permit. Co-founder of the Yes Men, Andy Bichlbaum, was arrested on an outstanding parking ticket charge and a handful of other Yes Men were served with summons and tickets for disorderly behavior and creating hazardous conditions.

The SurvivaBall was also used in a protest at the steps of the capitol. The protesting balls demanded action be taken on global warming to achieve the 350.org goal. Their strategy was to block the entrance until the government comes to a binding agreement on climate change.

=== US Chamber of Commerce ===
On October 19, 2009, the Yes Men spoofed the United States Chamber of Commerce, declaring a U-turn on their climate change policy. The Yes Men were not able to complete the conference without being exposed as a hoax, although their message that the United States Chamber of Commerce needs to reevaluate their direction in terms of clean energy was their primary concern and was received. Major TV and news organisations carried this story briefly before the hoax was uncovered. The US Chamber of Commerce two weeks later did change their official policy though, according to Al Gore it was &quot;not because of&quot; the Yes Men&#x27;s stunt. The Chamber launched a trademark and copyright infringement lawsuit against The Yes Men, who were defended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The suit was dropped in June 2013.

This action appears in their film, &quot;The Yes Men Are Revolting&quot;.

=== Canadian environment minister ===
During the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the Yes Men put out a statement in which they purported to be the Canadian environment minister, Jim Prentice. The statement pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The statement was followed by a response from the Ugandan delegation, praising the statement, that was also faked. Another fake statement was then put out blasting the falsehoods of the original fake statement. A fake story in a European edition of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; was also posted online. Jim Prentice described the hoax as &quot;undesirable&quot;.

=== Niger Delta hoax ===
On March 28, 2010, a video was released on YouTube with the title &quot;Shell: We are sorry&quot;. A man called Bradford Houppe, from the Ethical Affairs Committee at Royal Dutch Shell gave a four-minute-long apology to the people of the Niger Delta for ruining their land, water, and communities. This video was created in response to the numerous environmental problems and human rights violations that have occurred in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria since Shell began oil exploration in the region decades ago. Shell has yet to make any official statement about this video.

=== GE tax refund hoax reported by the AP ===
On April 13, 2011, a hoax website with a URL similar to that of the GE press domain (genewscenter.com) designed to look like the GE news center website. The hoax site posted the claim &quot;GE Responds to Public Outcry – Will Donate Entire $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to Help Offset Cuts and Save American Jobs.&quot; and it seems that the AP reported the story as fact, as reported by &quot;Good&quot;.

=== Shell Oil and ArcticReady.com ===
In June 2012, the Yes Men collaborated with Greenpeace and members of the Occupy Seattle movement to create ArcticReady.com, a parody website criticizing Shell Oil&#x27;s drilling activities in the Arctic Circle. The website launch was commemorated by a fake launch party held in the Seattle Space Needle. Shell Oil disavowed any affiliation with the website or the launch party on June 14, 2012.

=== The Action Switchboard ===
The Action Switchboard is a platform the Yes Men launched to link up people who want to be involved in activism events with people organising them. As it says &quot;The Action Switchboard is a platform that helps activists find each other, come up with direct action ideas, and get the resources they need to pull them off.&quot;

=== Edward Snowden Politicon interview ===
In October 2015, at the annual Politicon non-partisan political convention, the Yes Men promoted an interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden, known to be living in exile in Russia. As they introduced the interview, they announced that Snowden had been pardoned and would join the group in person. As Snowden appeared before them, people cheered, applauded and many rushed the stage for photos. A short time later, another Edward Snowden appeared on the giant screen; however, this time, it was the real Edward Snowden from Russia.

=== Politicon: new DNC platform ===
In July 2017, The Yes Men pranked the Democratic Party at Politicon. Following up the &quot;Better Deal&quot; agenda released by the party a week earlier, prankster Andy Bichlbaum posed as Frank Spencer, Deputy Vice Chair for Civic Engagement of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). As part of the new #DNCTakeBack campaign, Spencer pushed a more ambitious and progressive Democratic agenda, including: Medicare for all, tuition-free college, public campaign financing, stronger unions, an end to corporate lobbying and the end of for-profit prisons.

=== VW/Dieselgate apology ===
In November 2018, Motherboard/Vice released a video about The Yes Men and their fake VW &quot;Emissions Anonymous&quot; project. In the prank, they apologize to the public for the Dieselgate emissions scandal, in which several models and years of VW car family diesel autos were engineered and built with a rigged emissions system that ran clean only while under test conditions, but otherwise released high levels of air pollutants. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; even covered the pranksters&#x27; April 2018 entry in Houston&#x27;s annual Art Car Parade as if an official VW PR campaign: &quot;The marketing department has even turned the crisis into a publicity shtick&quot;.

===Fake &quot;Washington Post&quot; edition===
On January 16, 2019, parody editions of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; were distributed in Washington, D.C. Dated May 1, 2019, the edition&#x27;s headline read &quot;UNPRESIDENTED&quot; and the lead article described Donald Trump&#x27;s resignation from the presidency after a period of unrest. The Yes Men took credit for the edition.

=== COP26 ===
In November 2021, for the United Nations COP26 climate action summit in Glasgow, the pranksters shared news of a private jet interior design company&#x27;s membership in the UN&#x27;s ‘Race to Zero’ program, convincing some that they&#x27;d trolled the gathering by getting their fake company admitted. The prank was highlighting the absurdity that such a company actually exists and is a member of a net-zero program.

==Personal life==

Deshmukh was born on 26 May 1945 in Babhalgaon village in Latur district in the present-day Maharashtra. He was the eldest son of Dagdojirao Deshmukh and Sushiladevi. He had two younger sisters &#x27;Nalini&#x27;, &#x27;Vijaya&#x27; and one younger brother &#x27;Diliprao&#x27;.

His grandfather Venkatrao Deshmukh was a revenue officer in Hyderabad State and held Deshmukhi rights to collect revenues and establishing law and order in jurisdiction.

Deshmukh&#x27;s father Dagdojirao got hereditary rights after his grandfather, but were of less significance than the grandfather due to merge of Hyderabad state into Dominion of India. But he was a village head in of his native village which was then in Osmanabad district. He died on turn of 2000.

His mother Sushila Devi died earlier than his father, many of Vilasrao&#x27;s institutes are named after her. His younger brother Diliprao Deshmukh was member of Maharashtra legislative council and also minister in Government of Maharashtra during 2000–2018.

After completing his school education in native Latur city, he went to ILS Law College, Pune and thereafter to Pune University to study law. After passing out from the university, he began to practice law. He married Vaishali in 1973 and has three sons – Amit Deshmukh, a MLA in Maharashtra, Dheeraj Deshmukh a MLA and Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh. His three daughters in law include- Aditi Pratap, a television actress, Genelia D&#x27;Souza, a Bollywood actress and Deepshikha Deshmukh, a movie director.

Deshmukh was known as &#x27;Thorle Saheb&#x27; (meaning older companion) in native district and &#x27;Anna&#x27; (big brother) among his followers. He was devotee of Khandoba of Malegaon and Rokadeshwar Hanuman of Dhanegaon. He used to listen songs of Mohammed Rafi. He always resided in his ancestral home in village rather than in city.

==Political career==
Deshmukh entered active politics and became a member of the Babhalgaon (Latur) Village Panchayat from 1974 to 1980 and its Sarpanch (village chief) from 1974 to 1976. He was a member of Osmanabad Zilla Parishad and Deputy Chairman of Latur Taluka Panchayat Samiti (Latur District Panchayat Committee) from 1974 to 1980. As the President of Osmanabad District Youth Congress from 1975 to 1978, he worked for the implementation of the Sanjay Gandhi inspired Five Point Programme of the Youth Congress. He organised the youth in Osmanabad district and became the President of District wing of the Congress (I) party.

He was a Member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from 1980 to 1995 winning the 1980, 1985, and 1990 elections.

He was re-elected to the State Legislature from Latur Constituency in the elections held in September 1999 with a strong comeback winning by a margin of nearly 91,000 in two successive elections, the highest in Maharashtra. He was sworn in as Chief Minister of Maharashtra on 18 October 1999 and served until he stepped down from the post on 17 January 2003, as a result of factionalism in the state unit of the party and succeeded by Sushilkumar Shinde.

He was appointed Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises on 19 January 2011 after a cabinet reshuffle. Later on he was appointed Minister of Rural Development. He was appointed Minister of Science and Technology and Minister of Earth Sciences on 12 July 2011.

==Scams and controversies==

===26/11 attacks controversy and resignation===
In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Public opinion forced Deshmukh, and his deputy, the state home minister, R. R. Patil, to resign for being perceived as inept administrators and insensitive to the problems facing people in the state. He took the moral responsibility and offered to resign, which was then accepted by the party.

===Adarsh allegations===
An affidavit filed in the Bombay High Court on 27 April 2012 alleged that Deshmukh might be owning two flats through proxies in the Adarsh housing society in Mumbai. The case is pending for further investigation. Union Minister of Power Sushil Kumar Shinde, on 25 June 2012, told a judicial panel the decision to allot government land and grant of additional Floor Space Index to the housing society was taken during Deshmukh&#x27;s tenure as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.

==Involvement with education trusts==
Deshmukh founded the Manjra Charitable Trust which runs a number of colleges in Latur &amp; Mumbai. Some of them are Manajara Ayurvedic Medical College &amp; Hospital Latur, Abhinav College Latur, VDF polytechnique, VDF pharmacy college, VDF engineering college, Goldcrest high ICSE school, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology at Versova, Andheri in Mumbai and Sushiladevi Deshmukh Vidyalaya at Latur &amp; Airoli, Navi Mumbai. He also founded Marathwada Mitramandal under which there are two engineering colleges and one commerce college in Pune, and another one in Marathwada Mitra Mandal&#x27;s Institute of Technology Lohegaon, Pune.

==Illness and death==
Deshmukh was diagnosed with cirrhosis in summer 2011. Hints of his ailments, though kept private, included the writing of his will and a general lack of previous warmth and tiredness at the weddings of his two sons, Riteish and Dhiraj. He was admitted to Mumbai&#x27;s Breach Candy Hospital in the first week of August 2012, where he was diagnosed with liver and kidney failure. He was flown to Chennai for a liver transplant by air ambulance on 6 August. Attempts to commence the liver transplant failed as a clinically dead man, whose liver and kidney were to be transplanted into Deshmukh, died the night before the operation. He died the following day on 14 August at 14:00 due to an apparent multiple organ failure. He died in the presence of his family.

Reactions included then-INC president Sonia Gandhi who said that his death &quot;was a great loss to the party.&quot; President Pranab Mukherjee paid tribute and expressed grief, as did Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who called Deshmukh &quot;a trusted colleague and an able administrator who worked at panchayat, state and central levels with admirable dedication.&quot; Maharashtra BJP opposition leader Prakash Javadekar reacted in saying: &quot;It is a very sad news. He was warm-hearted and cheerful and always ready for helping (others). He had a vision for Maharashtra and was equally concerned about farmers and youngsters.&quot; Minister of State for Science and Technology Ashwani Kumar called Deshmukh a &quot;great human being&quot; who had an ability to connect with people and that he was &quot;very unwell. We were hoping for his recovery. I am saddened, shocked.&quot; Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan said his death was &quot;very unfortunate to lose such a promising leader at a young age.&quot; Janata Dal United (JDU) leader Sharad Yadav said his death resulted in a &quot;lot of pain,&quot; while Nationalist Congress Party leader Praful Patel said: &quot;He had a long journey in public life. He was a big leader, a wise leader. He knew all parts of Maharashtra very well. It is great loss for the country and big loss for Maharashtra.&quot;

Other condolences came from Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athawale. His death also elicited reaction from Bollywood, partly as a result of his son&#x27;s career in filmdom. These included Madhuri Dixit, Karan Johar, Bipasha Basu, Dia Mirza and Raveena Tandon, as well as Shah Rukh Khan who called Deshmukh a &quot;wonderful&quot; gentleman and said &quot;I&#x27;m feeling very sorry. I have known him (Vilasrao) for years. Riteish is a close friend of mine. I spoke to him. I am very sad, it is very unexpected.&quot;

His cremation took place on 15 August, India&#x27;s Independence Day at Babhalgaon, his village, in Latur district.

<doc id="1118672" wikidata="Q3487169" url="?curid=1118672" title="A Private Little War">
<text>&quot;A Private Little War&quot; is the nineteenth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gene Roddenberry, based on a story by Don Ingalls (under the pseudonym Jud Crucis), and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast on February 2, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; discovers Klingon interference in the development of a formerly peaceful planet and joins them in what becomes an arms race.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; orbits the planet Neural, a primitive world that Captain Kirk has visited before. On the planet, Kirk and First Officer Spock notice a group of villagers apparently preparing an ambush. Kirk is surprised to see them with firearms, and their quarry seems to be a group of Hill People, one of whom, Tyree, Kirk recognizes. Forbidden to use phasers, Kirk throws a rock toward the villagers, causing one of their guns to go off. A chase ensues and Spock is shot.

Once back aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Spock is taken to sickbay. Sensors detect a Klingon vessel in orbit around the planet, and Kirk suspects the Klingons of having supplied the firearms to the villagers.

Kirk returns with McCoy, both in native dress, to investigate. The two are attacked by an indigenous creature called a &quot;Mugato&quot;, which bites Kirk with its venomous fangs before McCoy can kill it with his phaser. McCoy is unable to call for help, as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has left orbit to avoid detection by the Klingons.

A friendly group of Hill People arrive and take Kirk and McCoy to their camp, where Kirk discovers that his friend Tyree is now their leader. Tyree is married to Nona, a &quot;Kahn-ut-tu&quot; woman who can cure the &quot;mugato&quot; bite. Nona has been urging Tyree to acquire firearms for their tribe.

On hearing of Kirk&#x27;s arrival, Nona enters the cave and spies McCoy using his phaser to heat rocks. Nona is intrigued and quizzes Tyree about the mysterious guests. She then proceeds to treat Kirk, pressing a &quot;mahko&quot; root into his injury with her hand which was cut with a knife just before the ritual began. At the conclusion of the ritual she claims that Kirk is now hers, and Tyree explains that, according to legend, he will be unable to refuse her anything as a result of the treatment. The injuries to Kirk and her hand are shown to be completely healed.

When Kirk recovers, he asks Tyree about the villagers&#x27; weapons. Tyree says he saw them for the first time a year ago and believed the villagers were making them. Kirk and McCoy decide to reconnoiter the village that night. Once there, they locate a forge in which they find a chrome steel drill and virtually carbon-free iron, evidence of outsiders&#x27; involvement. Soon a Klingon appears with the village leader, who discuss the manufacture of improved weapons. Kirk and McCoy surprise and overpower them, taking a flintlock weapon and escaping with Tyree&#x27;s help.

The next day, Kirk shows the Hill People how to use the weapon, but Tyree refuses to handle it. McCoy protests, but Kirk counters that both warring parties must be put on an equal footing if both are to survive.

Nona tries to seduce Kirk with the help of local herbs. A mugato attacks Nona and Kirk disintegrates it with his phaser. Nona then knocks Kirk unconscious, flees with the phaser, and coming upon a group of villagers, offers them the weapon. Not believing her story, they assault her. When Kirk, McCoy, and Tyree appear, the villagers believe she has led them into a trap, and kill her. The two groups fight and the villagers run away.

Tyree now demands more &quot;fire stick&quot; weapons to avenge his wife&#x27;s death. Kirk reluctantly orders Scott to manufacture and beam down a hundred flintlocks for the tribesmen. Scott questions the unusual order, and Kirk answers, &quot;A hundred ... Serpents for the Garden of Eden.&quot;

==Production and reception==
This episode has been analyzed as an allegory for the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War, in both the 1997 book, &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;, and a 2016 &quot;The New Yorker&quot; article.

Don Ingalls&#x27; first draft of the script had specific references to the Vietnam War, such as Mongolian-type clothes and a character described as a &quot;Ho Chi Minh&quot; type. Other early ideas included Kirk&#x27;s friendship with Tyree developing completely during Kirk&#x27;s second visit to the planet and a personal conflict between Kirk and Krell the Klingon. Eugene Myers and Torie Atkinson of Tor.com argue that the episode is sexist in its presentation of Nona, and that the episode, in trying too hard to be an allegory for the war in Vietnam, fails to find a peaceful, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, solution to the problem.

The episode credit title shows &quot;Gumato&quot; as this was the creature&#x27;s original name.

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Mugato the 43rd best aliens of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2017, Inverse recommended &quot;A Private Little War&quot; as &quot;essential watching&quot; for &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 14th best original series episode.

In September 2021 the Mugato is featured in &#x27;Mugato, Gumato&#x27;, the fourth episode of the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;.

==Notes==

The Mugato was originally named The Gumato and is shown as such in episode credit

<text>Ovie Clark Fisher (November 22, 1903 – December 9, 1994) was an attorney and non-academic historian who served for 32 years as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 21st congressional district.

==Early life==
Fisher was born in Junction in Kimble County, Texas to Jobe Bazilee and Rhoda Catherine Clark Fisher. He married Marian E. De Walsh on September 11, 1927. A daughter named Rhoda was the couple&#x27;s only child.

Fisher attended University of Texas at Austin, University of Colorado at Boulder, and Baylor University at Waco, from which he received his LL.B. He was admitted to the bar in 1929.

==Career==
Fisher practiced law in San Angelo in West Texas for two years. In 1931, he was elected county attorney for Tom Green County.

Fisher represented the 53rd District of Texas in the Texas House of Representatives from 1935 to 1937. From 1937 to 1943, Fisher was District Attorney for the 51st Judicial District of Texas.
In 1942, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat and served in the 78th Congress to the 93rd Congress. In 1972, the Republican Doug Harlan held Fisher to 57 percent of the general election vote. Paul Burka of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said Harlan&#x27;s success was &quot;one of the first indications that the dominance of the rural conservative Democrats in Texas politics could not be sustained.&quot;

Fisher was one of five U.S. representatives from Texas to sign the &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot; in protest of the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Fisher voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

After heart surgery in 1973, Fisher announced that he would not be stand for re-election in 1974. His party nominated Robert Krueger as his successor, who defeated Harlan, who made his second and last race for Congress.

Fisher died on December 9, 1994.

==Legacy==
Baylor University is the repository for the O.C. Fisher Papers.

In 1975, San Angelo Lake, a reservoir managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers was renamed O.C. Fisher Reservoir in his honor. San Angelo State Park is on the shores of the reservoir.

==Fraternal memberships==

Fisher had membership in the following organizations:

*Freemasons
*Order of the Eastern Star
*Knights of Pythias
*Rotary International
*Acacia fraternity

<text>Hollyoaks is a British soap opera which originally began airing on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was created by Phil Redmond, who had previously conceived the soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;. From 2005 to 2023, episodes have aired on sister channel E4 a day prior to their broadcast on Channel 4. In 2023, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was removed from Channel 4&#x27;s early evening schedule, but remains on E4 and Channel 4&#x27;s on demand service with episodes now uploaded to YouTube. At its inception, the soap was targeted towards an adolescent and young adult audience but it has since broadened its appeal to all age groups. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; has covered various taboo subjects rarely seen on British television, for which it has received numerous awards. It has won the award for Best British Soap twice, in 2014 and 2019; its first win broke the 15-year tie between rival soap operas &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Beginning with a cast of 15 characters, it now has 37 regular cast members. The longest-serving actor is Nick Pickard, who has portrayed Tony Hutchinson since the first episode.

==Characters==

In its first episode, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; began with a cast of fifteen, seven of whom were teenagers that received the main focus of the soap. These teenagers were Kurt Benson (Jeremy Edwards), Jambo Bolton (Will Mellor), Natasha Andersen (Shebah Ronay), Louise Taylor (Brett O&#x27;Brien), Maddie Parker (Yasmin Bannerman), Dawn Cunningham (Lisa Williamson), and Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard); all of these but Pickard departed the series prior to 2000. Pickard stated that he was only signed for 26 episodes and exclaimed his joy at having appeared on the show since its inception. In more recent years, the cast has increased to typically 50 cast members, with the increase of castings being accredited to being a fast-paced soap.

== Production ==
===Production team===
Bryan Kirkwood joined the show as executive producer in 2006, but left three years later to become producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. After he left his role in 2009, a number of producers worked on the show, resulting in a number of creative reinventions and changes in direction during this time. Lucy Allan was named as Kirkwood&#x27;s successor. In 2010, Allan announced she was to step down from the series after only a year, being replaced by Paul Marquess. Speaking of her decision, Allan stated: &quot;I am very proud to have been part of the &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; team. I&#x27;ve had a fantastic time working on this show but am now equally excited about what the future will hold.&quot; On his upcoming role of series producer, Marquess said: &quot;Taking up this position at Lime Pictures feels like I&#x27;m going home, as I began my career working with both Carolyn [Reynolds] and Tony [Wood] at Granada and my first major project was &quot;Brookside&quot; at Mersey Television. I&#x27;m a huge soap fan so to be handed the reins of Channel 4&#x27;s flagship teen drama is not only a huge challenge but also a massive honour.&quot; Lime Pictures creative director Tony Wood added: &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank Lucy Allan for making such a contribution to &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; over the years and wish her well for the future. It&#x27;s very exciting to be working with Paul Marquess again. He&#x27;s one of the best showrunners in the business. This is a brilliant appointment for &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.&quot;

Only one day after being announced as the new producer, Marquess began work on the soap opera. A Channel 4 spokesperson stated: &quot;It&#x27;s all been a very quick turnaround at the top. It was announced in January 2011 that Marquess would leave his role as series producer and would be succeeded by &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; production team member Gareth Philips. Discussing the news, Philips said: &quot;I have really enjoyed working in the script team at &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; and it will be a huge honour to take the reins of Channel 4&#x27;s flagship youth drama. I am very excited about taking the show even further this year with more compelling and brave stories.&quot; Emma Smithwick later replaced Philips in autumn 2011. In late-September 2012, it was announced that Kirkwood would be returning to &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, replacing Smithwick. On 3 September 2020, Kirkwood announced his exit as showrunner. In a statement, he said: &quot;For many years I have had the privilege of running a soap opera with a fiercely loyal audience. I passionately believe that soaps can help viewers start serious conversations about their lives and in recent years we have covered important topics within mental health, sexual consent, Far-Right radicalisation, male rape, sexual abuse and many issues other shows might look away from.&quot; Channel 4&#x27;s director of programmes, Ian Katz, thanked Kirkwood for his work, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m immensely grateful for his steering of the show safely back to screen next week and leaving it in top creative form and I wish him all the best for his next chapter.&quot; Allan was again named as Kirkwood&#x27;s successor. Kirkwood&#x27;s final episode as executive producer aired on 30 July 2021, with Allan&#x27;s episodes airing from 2 August 2021. Two years into her tenure, Allan was sacked alongside series producer Philip Dodds and script and storyline executive Josie Day. Hannah Cheers and Angelo Abela were named as successors to Allan, serving as acting executive producers until a permanent replacement is named. Allan&#x27;s final episode as executive producer aired on 8 November 2023, with Cheers and Abela&#x27;s episodes airing from 9 November 2023.

=== Filming locations ===

Although set in Chester, the majority of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is filmed at Lime Pictures&#x27; studios in Childwall, Liverpool. In the early years, location scenes were filmed around the city and at The Groves next to the River Dee in Chester, but it became too expensive for the filming operations to be moved from Liverpool to Chester for every filming block, resulting in most filming being made at the Childwall studios. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is produced by Lime Pictures (formerly known as Mersey Television prior to its takeover by All3Media).

===Opening titles and tune===
The original opening theme tune was written and performed by Steve Wright, who has also produced music and themes for &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. He cited American performer Bo Diddley as an inspiration whilst making the theme song. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; amend their opening titles frequently. In 2007, &quot;Hollyoaks″&quot; opening titles were revamped and a new theme tune was introduced. The show&#x27;s graphic designer Simon Cox created the visuals and their composer Steve Wright remixed the theme tune. The show&#x27;s executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood changed the titles to &quot;reflect&quot; how the show had changed and &quot;appeal&quot; more to their viewers with a &quot;young, glamorous and sexy&quot; theme. They debuted on 26 February 2007.

It was announced on 19 June 2010 that new titles with a new theme tune, which was reportedly &quot;slowed right down&quot;, would be used in new series producer Paul Marquess&#x27;s first episode, which aired on 5 July 2010. However, on 2 July, the titles were delayed for one week. The titles were then delayed for a second time due to &quot;technical difficulties&quot;. On 10 September 2010, Channel 4 confirmed the new &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; titles and theme music would air from 13 September. However, the titles were different from pictures of filming of the original credits, suggesting a reshoot was the reason for the delay. Marquess commented: &quot;We&#x27;re very excited about the new titles that the viewers will see on Channel 4 on Monday. They&#x27;re glossy, contemporary and very &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.&quot; He then apologised for the delay, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re sorry to the fans who have been waiting to see them, but they&#x27;ve taken a while to perfect. I&#x27;m very happy with them and I hope that the fans like the new-look show.&quot; On 28 December 2012, New titles where added, with purple screen replaced by grey screen.

It was announced in August 2016 that a new title sequence would begin airing from 5 September 2016, which would launch the show&#x27;s &quot;action-packed autumn storyline&quot;. The new title sequence features shots of characters on the show&#x27;s set. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said of the titles, &quot;I am thrilled with the new titles. I think they are vibrant, fun and glossy and from the first opening guitar riff feel completely Hollyoaks.&quot; Shots from the new title sequence included Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) riding a carousel with his children, Leah Barnes (Ela-May Dermican) and Lucas Hay (William Hall), Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) lying on a bed of petals, and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) appearing in the village dressed in a &quot;striking red dress&quot;. On 13 May 2019, a new title sequence, as well as altered theme music, was launched; for the new sequence, a &quot;family theme, putting each of the soap&#x27;s iconic families front and centre&quot; are seen on the series&#x27; set. In January 2021, the titles were updated again to represent new characters that had joined the series; the change was described as a &quot;brand new era&quot; for &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. In January 2022, new titles premiered to represent the introduction of several new characters and the departure of numerous others. Speaking on the new titles, executive producer Lucy Allan explained that she wanted them to &quot;highlight the optimism of a place like Hollyoaks – in spite of all the murders!&quot;

=== Music ===
&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is the one of only two British soaps to make regular use of incidental music (the other being the Welsh language soap &quot;Rownd a Rownd&quot; on S4C). A number of real acts have also performed during transmitted episodes of the series. The Alphites were the first band to perform on the programme, when they played in the SU Bar. In 2003, &quot;Pop Idol&quot; runner up Darius Campbell appeared in an episode performing at a graduation ball. In 2008, the band Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly also featured in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, performing as part of a Battle of the Bands contest. During November 2008, The Saturdays were featured in two episodes of spin-off &quot;Hollyoaks Later&quot;. In 2009, McFly featured in the show and played a song in the SU Bar. They also had speaking roles and convinced characters Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) and Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) to date. Later that year, Girls Can&#x27;t Catch performed &quot;Keep Your Head Up&quot; during the college graduation party. In July 2013, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; also featured &#x27;Off The Wall Oompah&#x27; Band Hosen Brass, playing a selection of their own cover versions for Darren&#x27;s Bavarian Night(s) at the Dog In The Pond. Hosen Brass featured on two consecutive episodes over the Friday and the Monday evening.

=== Sponsorship ===
&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was initially sponsored by Nescafé, which held a one-year £9.5 million deal from June 2002 until July 2003. The show did not have a sponsor until June 2005, when Wrigley&#x27;s signed a twelve-month contract for their brand of Extra chewing gum. The contract ended in December 2009. Nikon Coolpix signed a deal for sponsorship in 2010 which ended in September 2010, before resuming in January 2011, as part of a 12-month deal. Nikon group marketing manager, Jeremy Gilbert described &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; viewers as &quot;the perfect demographic&quot; In September 2010, it was announced mobile phone retailer Phones4u would take over sponsorship from 1 October 2010 as part of a 3-month deal. Caspar Nelson, the head of brand communications at Phones4u, said their research had shown that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was the most-watched TV show for their target audience.

Nikon Coolpix signed a new 12-month sponsorship deal in December 2010, beginning in January 2011. On 11 April 2012, a six-month product placement deal with L&#x27;Oréal was revealed. On 31 May 2012, a four-month product placement deal with Nokia was announced. Unilever took over sponsorship of the show from 2 January 2013, with sponsorship switching between its Impulse body spray brand and its Alberto VO5 brand. In January 2015, Domino&#x27;s Pizza were announced as the new sponsors of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. Five years later, it was announced that Batiste Dry Shampoo had begun sponsoring the programme. In mid November 2020, clothing brand Jack Wills became the sponsor of the soap.

==Broadcast==
===United Kingdom===
The series initially aired on Mondays in 1995, with the exception of the second episode which aired on Friday 27 October 1995 and was repeated on Sunday evenings. In July 1996, Mersey TV opted to recommission the show and increase its output to twice a week, beginning that October with a Thursday episode. A third episode was introduced in September 1999, airing on Wednesdays and a fourth in 2001. In November 2003, following the cancellation of &quot;Brookside&quot;, the show increased its output with a fifth episode, which has remained until March 2020.

Since the channel&#x27;s free-to-air launch in May 2005, Channel 4&#x27;s digital sister station E4 airs a daily &quot;First Look&quot; feature at 19:00 each weekday, in which viewers are able to watch the episode to be shown on Channel 4 the following day. The &#x27;first-look&#x27; is occasionally omitted, primarily if the following day&#x27;s C4 episode is a special or event edition, and on these occasions may be replaced with a related programme or special.

Repeats of each day&#x27;s edition of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; air on E4 the following weekday; as of 2021, it is shown at 06:00. All of the week&#x27;s episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; are also compiled into an omnibus on Channel 4, and as of 2020, a signed and audio described version is transmitted at 02:25, and a regular version at 06:00. Episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, including the weekly omnibus, are also available for catch-up viewing online through the Channel 4 streaming platform. From 2009 to 2012, the series also broadcast on YouTube, after Google reached a three-year deal with Channel 4. In 2019, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; became the first soap opera to release a boxset of episodes onto a streaming service. The soap released their Christmas and New Year&#x27;s episodes on Channel 4&#x27;s in-house streaming service Channel 4 and they have continued this practice each December since.

On 22 March 2020, Channel 4 suspended production and filming of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From 30 March, new episodes being broadcast was reduced from five to three, airing on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. However, on 6 April, this was reduced again from three to two, airing Monday and Tuesday, with the final pre-COVID episode screening on Monday 20 July. The slots belonging to new episodes on E4 were filled by &quot;Hollyoaks Favourites&quot;. After the resumption of production, producers stated they expect to return to five weekly episodes in 2021.

In June 2020, episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; were made available on social media platform Snapchat. In shortened segments featuring the highlights of an episode, they premiere on the app immediately after broadcast. In February 2022, it was announced by Channel 4 that new episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; would premiere on All 4 (now Channel 4) prior to their broadcast on television. They confirmed that the changes would take place from March 2022 and that each episode would become available in the early morning of each weekday. In September 2023, broadcast became again more digitally focused when it was announced that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was to be removed from Channel 4&#x27;s schedule, but would remain on E4 and streaming services. They also began premiering episodes on YouTube.

On 29 February 2024, it was announced by Channel 4 that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; will have its weekly episode count reduced from five to three episodes a week starting from September 2024. It was confirmed that this reduced output of scheduled episodes will have an effect on cast and crew cuts with approximately 135 job cuts and losses, because of this production and filming of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; had been suspended and halted for the remainder of the day. Stephanie Waring, who played Cindy Cunningham, the show&#x27;s longest-serving female character, since 1996, was the first cast member to reveal she had lost her job as a result of the budget cuts, stating that the producers had given her the option of announcing she had quit of her own volition.

On 27 August 2024, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; released its autumn 2024 preview trailer whilst also confirming its new schedule within its reduced episode format to three episodes a week airing on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday starting from its stunt week from 9 September 2024 followed by a one-year time jump the following week from 16 September 2024. Prior to these changes &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; will air a final full week of episodes Monday to Friday with a six episode special week for the week of 2 September 2024.

===International broadcast===
In New Zealand, the show aired on TV1, TV2 and C4. In Australia, from October 2010 to January 2012, the digital multichannel 7Two had broadcast double episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; from September 2009. Previously, in the United States, beginning in March 2014, the streaming service Hulu began adding episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;; episodes were uploaded to the service two weeks after their initial airing in the UK. However, in November 2023, Hulu announced that they have stopped adding new episodes after stating that they had lost the rights to the series and all episodes had disappeared from the platform. In France, the soap airs dubbed in French on TF1 Séries Films under the title &quot;Hollyoaks, l&#x27;amour mode d&#x27;emploi&quot;.

== Storylines ==

Over the course of the series&#x27; history, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; has dealt with a number of storylines based upon serious issues. Given the large and established proportion of young viewers, some feel that the soap opera is an ideal platform to show a variety of issues affecting young people. Earlier episodes were focused on partying and relationships, but the focus quickly went onto issue-led storylines including mental health, rape and self-harm. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; has become notable for being the first soap to address various social issues. Series producer Iain MacLeod explained that despite having a tea-time timeslot, they continue to push important social issues as he felt it would be &quot;patronising&quot; to do otherwise. Despite feeling a responsibility to cover these issues, MacLeod also liked that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; mixes in serious scenes with comedic and lighthearted scenes. It has been noted that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; storylines have a fast pace, which some viewers enjoy.

A 2007 episode which showed a number of the characters falling ill at a party due to carbon monoxide poisoning helped make a viewer realise that the symptoms of illness she had been feeling were caused by a potentially fatal carbon monoxide leak in her home. By being made aware of the effects from the episode, she was able to receive medical treatment that saved her life. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was the first British soap opera to have a &quot;non-linear&quot; week. Commencing 14 September 2009, the special week saw storylines being played out in non-chronological order, something which has never been dealt with within the soap&#x27;s history. Producer Lucy Allan stated in an interview with Digital Spy, &quot;It was an idea pitched by Richard Burke, one of our writers, at my first long-term story conference back in February. What&#x27;s great about it is that it&#x27;s a really great storyline, but with the way he pitched – in making it non-linear – it was even better. It&#x27;s just like if something happened to one of your mates and you try and put the pieces of the puzzle together as to what happened, you don&#x27;t find all the people who tell you what happened in chronological order. You get bits here and there and piece it together. It&#x27;s exactly the sort of thing Hollyoaks should be doing, challenging its audience.&quot; In late 2009, it was announced that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; would make another soap first by screening a flashforward episode. On 21 December 2009, the series&#x27; time-line moved forward six months into May 2010. The episode featured the second wedding of Calvin Valentine and Carmel McQueen. Series producer Lucy Allan stated: &quot;We&#x27;re really excited by this future episode – &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is the only soap that can tamper with time and give our audience the opportunity to look at events that haven&#x27;t yet taken place. A lot can happen in six months, so viewers should expect to be asking a lot of questions of some of their favourite characters&#x27; actions and behaviour.&quot; Ricky Whittle, who plays Calvin, added: &quot;Calvin&#x27;s completely besotted with Carmel. She&#x27;s the one he&#x27;s always wanted – she&#x27;s always been his true love since they first started seeing each other and everyone&#x27;s always wanted them to get back together.&quot;

Later in September, it was announced that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, teaming up with Channel 4 Education&#x27;s &quot;Battlefront&quot;, would explore an underage sex storyline involving 12-year-old characters Finn O&#x27;Connor (Connor Wilkinson) and Amber Sharpe (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which would lead to Amber&#x27;s pregnancy. Explaining the storyline, Paul Marquess said: &quot;&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; has long been credited for tackling difficult issues that affect young people in a sensitive and intelligent way. I am very proud that we are once again bringing to the forefront a subject for our young audience that many parents, politicians and schools struggle to address. The storyline very clearly communicates to the audience that Amber and Finn were not emotionally or physically ready to engage in any sexual activity. And make no mistake, there will be no fairytale ending for Amber; she is faced with the most difficult situation she could ever imagine.&quot;

In November 2012, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; aired &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot;, in which four regular characters were killed: Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), and three sixth form students, Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman), Neil Cooper (Tosin Cole) and Jono (Dylan Llewellyn). In October 2013, as part of the celebration of the soap opera turning 18, the show aired &quot;Hollyoaks — The Blast&quot; from 15 October until the end of the week. The storyline saw a cast massacre with five main characters being killed off through the week, and two were also killed off in the annual &quot;Hollyoaks Later&quot;. In November 2014, the show aired &quot;Hollyoaks  – End of The Line&quot; from 17 to 21 November. The storyline saw newcomers Porshe McQueen (Twinnie Lee Moore) and Lockie Campbell (Nick Rhys) celebrate their wedding reception on a party train, and Sienna Blake (Anna Passey)&#x27;s car becomes stuck on the tracks after a car chase with her father Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield), causing the train to smash into it and derail. Long-running character Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) was killed when the wreckage exploded after saving her cousin Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) from &quot;villainous&quot; Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine), who also died in the explosion, who wanted revenge on her for killing Calvin in 2010. Long-running character Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) also &quot;died&quot; in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel, in a plot that saw her brutally murdered in the McQueen house by Grace Black. As of December 2014, only two original McQueen family members remain on screen, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barbara Lane) and John Paul McQueen (James Sutton). Mercedes returned in February 2015. In June of that year, Phoebe died after Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) injected her with potassium chloride. Cleo moves into the house in late January 2015.

As part of the 20th anniversary in October 2015, a number of long-running storylines reached a climax point. In particular, it features the exposure of the affair between Ste Hay and Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool) to his father Tony and the other characters during a Hollyoaks Pride event. The underage sixth form student had begun questioning his sexuality following a kiss with John Paul McQueen, later developing strong feelings for Ste. The plot involving Diane O&#x27;Connor, Tony and Tegan Lomax regarding their children who had been switched at birth is also concluded. The week also features the departure of the Osborne family from the Dog in the Pond pub and they had moved to the Boarding House which was previously owned by (Dennis Savage). Another storyline featured was the reveal of the Gloved Hand Killer (the identity of whom had been a mystery to viewers since January). The killer has murdered five characters up to that point (Rick Spencer, Mariam Andrews, Will Savage, Phoebe McQueen and Dylan Jenkins), has had two failed attempts (Esther Bloom and Diane O&#x27;Connor) and killed another two during the week (Ashley Davidson, Dr. S&#x27;avage) before Lindsey Butterfield is revealed as the serial killer when she seemingly murders another regular character (Freddie Roscoe). However, he is later revealed to be alive. A month later, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; aired (for the first time) a stillbirth storyline in which Mercedes loses her baby with Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). 2015 was also the year they introduced the character of Sally St. Claire, the new head-teacher who would later be revealed as John-Paul McQueen&#x27;s (James Sutton) parent, as she is a trans woman. The character is notable as the first regular trans character in the UK soap opera to be portrayed by a trans woman.

In 2017, the show featured a self-harming storyline with the character Lily Drinkwell (Lauren McQueen) and her friends Peri Lomax (Ruby O&#x27;Donnell) and Yasmine Maalik (Haiesha Mistry), which won Best Storyline and Best Single Episode at The British Soap Awards. In 2019, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; became the first British television programme to tackle the issue of far-right extremism and radicalisation with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) central to the storyline. At the same time, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; created the first storyline of Munchausen syndrome with Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) central to the storyline. On 21 December 2019, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; aired a one-year flash forward episode to 31 December 2020, which showed sneak peaks of the upcoming county lines drug trafficking storyline fallout. The storyline was a heavy focus on the soap for over a year. The highlights of the storyline saw Juliet Nightingale (Niamh Blackshaw) and Sid Sumner (Billy Price) become groomed into selling drugs by Jordan Price (Connor Calland) and Victor Brothers (Benjamin O&#x27;Mahony), Juliet coming out as a lesbian and developing a relationship with Sid&#x27;s adoptive sister Peri, Ollie Morgan (Gabriel Clark) becoming addicted to ketamine, Ella Richardson (Erin Palmer) killing Jordan, and Sid faking his death to have Victor jailed.

In April 2021, an episode of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; that was focused on the unconscious biases that Black women suffer from was transmitted. The episode focuses on a day in the life of both Grace Black (Tamara Wall) and Martine Deveraux (Kéllé Bryan), detailing the microaggressions that Martine faces as a Black woman in the United Kingdom. The episode was followed by an hour-long special in September 2021. The episode aired on Channel 4&#x27;s Black to Front day and exclusively starred Black characters. The episode was also produced, written and directed by Black creatives.

== Reception ==
In 2001, students at University of Chester objected to a storyline which they say misrepresented students in the city. Students Union president Gordon Reay said, &quot;Students at other universities think we are a bunch of radicals and militants because that&#x27;s how the students are portrayed in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. They assume that the college in the programme is Chester College, because &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; is set in the city.&quot; In 2007, the soap was further criticised along with other soap operas for the amount of alcohol consumption featured on-screen. The Food Commission monitored that 18 per cent of scenes feature consumption and warned that it was conditioning teenagers into thinking it is normal to consume so much alcohol. A similar incident occurred in 1997 when the Independent Television Commission criticised the series for using an existing brand of alcohol, Caffrey&#x27;s Irish Ale in the soap claiming that it breached broadcasting rules and promoted the product.

In October 2009, Channel 4 was criticised for broadcasting character Barry Newton&#x27;s (Nico Mirallegro) attempted suicide, which showed similarities to an incident which happened the same week in Glasgow, in which two teenagers committed suicide by jumping into the River Clyde. In its defence, a Channel 4 spokesperson stated that any similarities in the storyline were &quot;entirely coincidents&quot;. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; producers felt that it was best to continue with the transmission of the episodes. They explained that due to being a continuing series, the viewers would be familiar with Barry and that it would be helpful to address a &quot;sensitive issue&quot; followed by a programme support announcement directing viewers to a 24-hour helpline.

In late November 2009, it was announced that character Loretta Jones (Melissa Walton) would be revealed to have killed a child when she was twelve years old. A &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; spokesperson said, &quot;The drama is about how Loretta reacts to Chrissy&#x27;s arrival back in her life and how she copes with all the memories coming back.&quot; The storyline was criticised due to its similarities to real events, such as the murder of James Bulger. The mother of Bulger, Denise Fergus, stated her outrage of the storyline while speaking to &quot;Click Liverpool&quot;. She expressed her disgust as she had not been consulted, and felt that the producers were making a &quot;horrific murder&quot; into a topic for entertainment to gain viewers. She demanded a meeting with producers since she felt that the storyline was a &quot;horrible insult to the memory of [her] beautiful son.&quot; A spokesperson for Channel 4 stated that the storyline was not based on a real-life event and that producers did not intend to &quot;seek to recreate real events&quot;. Despite the storyline not being based on Fergus&#x27; situation, producers pulled the storyline from transmission since they felt that they had a duty to &quot;deal with sensitive issues in an appropriate way&quot;.

&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; has been praised by viewers, critics and award ceremonies for the way they handle issue-led storylines. In 2018, Duncan Lindsay of the &quot;Metro&quot; wrote a piece on &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; being &quot;top of its game for tackling important issues&quot;. He felt that the soap had &quot;well and truly shed any reputation for being a bonkers, teen soap&quot; and that it had become known for &quot;careful, considered and dignified tackling of sensitive and important social issues&quot;. Lindsay wrote that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; does not get enough recognition for its output, especially for filming using a single-camera setup to produce five episodes a week. He felt that despite their early evening timeslot, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; &quot;bravely goes where many later night programmes dare not&quot;. Series producer Iain MacLeod stated that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; often receive positive feedback from charities. He explained that their issue-led storylines result in &quot;huge numbers of people coming forward&quot; to the charities. Following their #DontFilterFeelings campaign focusing on mental health, cast and crew members were invited to the Houses of Parliament to discuss challenging stigma on the subject with members of parliament.

&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; performs well on its streaming service Channel 4. it was revealed in February 2022 that the soap was Channel 4&#x27;s most-streamed scripted series of 2021, and the second most-streamed series in general.

== Spin-offs ==

&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; occasionally broadcasts late-night spin-off editions of the main show, usually due to them containing adult themes and controversial plots. Two video specials have also been released. In 2001, a new 16 part spin-off series was produced entitled &quot;&quot;, this was followed by two subsequent series, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the latter appearing as its own show rather to a spin-off. In 2008, a late-night spin-off was produced by Lucy Allan named &quot;Hollyoaks Later&quot;. This first series, although being broadcast late at night, was more of a spin-off than a special. A second series was commissioned the following year and aired in September. A third series was announced in April 2010 before airing later that year. A fourth series of &quot;Hollyoaks Later&quot; aired in September 2011 and saw the return of Hollie-Jay Bowes as Michaela McQueen. A fifth series aired in September 2012, and a sixth in October 2013. &quot;Hollyoaks Later&quot; returned for a one-off special in 2020, which featured the demise of serial killer Breda McQueen (Moya Brady), as well as the introduction of Verity Hutchinson (Eva O&#x27;Hara). In October 2009, &quot;The Hollyoaks Music Show&quot; began with celebrity artists performing on the set of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. Some of the acts that performed in the series include Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Jason Derulo, The Saturdays, Olly Murs and more. The series was sponsored by Matalan and ended in December 2011.

In 2021, &quot;&quot; a series of real-life documentaries, which was produced by Lime Digital and commissioned by Channel 4. The series had five episodes, each one based on a high-profile &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; storyline that had an impact on Hollyoaks fan lives. &quot;Hollyoaks: IRL&quot; series has been nominated for a BAFTA TV Award Short-form programme award 2022. John Junior, who shared his suicide story on BBC Radio 5, inspired the series, which features him and his story.

=== Calendars ===
From 2001 to 2012, the cast of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; produced two annual calendars. One is entitled &quot;Hollyoaks Babes&quot;, which features the female cast, and the other is &quot;Hollyoaks Hunks&quot;, which features the male cast. For the calendar shoot, actors and actresses usually set off to exotic holiday destinations; however, in September 2009, it was revealed that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 caused the production team to have to make cuts and therefore could no longer go abroad for the shoot.

<doc id="1118686" wikidata="Q6035663" url="?curid=1118686" title="Inner model">
<text>In set theory, a branch of mathematical logic, an inner model for a theory &quot;T&quot; is a substructure of a model &quot;M&quot; of a set theory that is both a model for &quot;T&quot; and contains all the ordinals of &quot;M&quot;.

==Definition==

Let &quot;L&quot; = ⟨∈⟩ be the language of set theory. Let &quot;S&quot; be a particular set theory, for example the ZFC axioms and let &quot;T&quot; (possibly the same as &quot;S&quot;) also be a theory in &quot;L.&quot; 

If &quot;M&quot; is a model for &quot;S,&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is an such that

# &quot;N&quot; is a substructure of &quot;M,&quot; i.e. the interpretation ∈&quot;N&quot; of ∈ in &quot;N&quot; is ∈&quot;M&quot; ∩ &quot;N&quot;2
# &quot;N&quot; is a model of &quot;T&quot;
# the domain of &quot;N&quot; is a transitive class of &quot;M&quot;
# &quot;N&quot; contains all ordinals in &quot;M&quot;
then we say that &quot;N&quot; is an inner model of &quot;T&quot; (in &quot;M&quot;). Usually &quot;T&quot; will equal (or subsume) &quot;S&quot;, so that &quot;N&quot; is a model for &quot;S&quot; &#x27;inside&#x27; the model &quot;M&quot; of &quot;S&quot;.

If only conditions 1 and 2 hold, &quot;N&quot; is called a standard model of &quot;T&quot; (in &quot;M&quot;), a &quot;standard submodel&quot; of &quot;T&quot; (if &quot;S&quot; = &quot;T&quot; and) &quot;N&quot; is a &quot;set&quot; in &quot;M&quot;. A model &quot;N&quot; of &quot;T&quot; in &quot;M&quot; is called &quot;transitive&quot; when it is standard and condition 3 holds. If the axiom of foundation is not assumed (that is, is not in &quot;S&quot;) all three of these concepts are given the additional condition that &quot;N&quot; be well-founded. Hence inner models are transitive, transitive models are standard, and standard models are well-founded.

The assumption that there exists a standard submodel of ZFC (in a given universe) is stronger than the assumption that there exists a model. In fact, if there is a standard submodel, then there is a smallest standard submodel 
called the &quot;minimal model&quot; contained in all standard submodels. The minimal submodel contains no standard submodel (as it is minimal) but (assuming the consistency of ZFC) it contains
some model of ZFC by the Gödel completeness theorem. This model is necessarily not well-founded otherwise its Mostowski collapse would be a standard submodel. (It is not well-founded as a relation in the universe, though it
satisfies the axiom of foundation so is &quot;internally&quot; well-founded. Being well-founded is not an absolute property.)
In particular in the minimal submodel there is a model of ZFC but there is no standard submodel of ZFC.

==Use==
Usually when one talks about inner models of a theory, the theory one is discussing is ZFC or some extension of ZFC (like ZFC + &quot;a measurable cardinal exists&quot;). When no theory is mentioned, it is usually assumed that the model under discussion is an inner model of ZFC. However, it is not uncommon to talk about inner models of subtheories of ZFC (like ZF or KP) as well.

==Related ideas==
Kurt Gödel proved that any model of ZF has a least inner model of ZF, the constructible universe, which is also an inner model of ZFC + GCH. 

There is a branch of set theory called inner model theory that studies ways of constructing least inner models of theories extending ZF. Inner model theory has led to the discovery of the exact consistency strength of many important set theoretical properties.

<doc id="1118689" wikidata="Q162312" url="?curid=1118689" title="Reichsführer-SS">
<text> (, ) was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the (SS). &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest-serving and most noteworthy office holder was Heinrich Himmler.

==Definition==
 was both a title and a rank. The title of was first created in 1926 by the second commander of the SS, Joseph Berchtold. Julius Schreck, founder of the SS and Berchtold&#x27;s predecessor, never referred to himself as . Yet, the title was retroactively applied to him in later years. In 1929, Heinrich Himmler became and referred to himself by his title instead of his regular SS rank of . This set the precedent for the commander of the SS to be called .

Prior to the Night of the Long Knives, the SS was an elite corps of the (SA or storm troopers), and the was subordinate to the SA&#x27;s operating head, the . On 20 July 1934, as part of the purge of the SA, the SS was made an independent branch of the Nazi Party, responsible only to Hitler. From that point on, the title of became an actual rank, and in fact the highest rank of the SS. In this position, Himmler was on paper the equivalent of a in the German Army. As Himmler&#x27;s position and authority grew in Nazi Germany, so did his rank in a &quot;de facto&quot; sense. Further, there was never more than one at any one time, with Himmler holding the position as his personal title from 1929 (becoming his actual rank in 1934) until April 1945.

==Duties==
Under its original inception, the title and rank of was the designation for the head of the (General-SS). In this capacity, the SS Reich Leader was the direct commander of the SS Senior District Leaders (&quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Führer&quot;); by 1936, the was head of the three main SS branches: the , (SS-VT; political action troops), and the (SS-TV; concentration camp service).

During the Second World War, the in effect held several additional roles and wielded enormous personal power. He was responsible for all internal security within Nazi Germany. He was overseer of the concentration camps, extermination camps (through the Concentration Camps Inspectorate and SS-TV), and the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mobile death squads (through the Reich Security Main Office; RSHA). Over time, his influence on both civil and foreign policy became marked, as the &quot;Reichsführer&quot; reported directly to Hitler and his actions were not tempered by checks and balances. This meant the office holder could implement broad policy, such as the Nazi plan for the Genocide or extermination of the Jews, or order criminal acts such as the &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot; murders, without impediment.

It is difficult to separate the office from the duties assigned to the individual. As of 20 April 1934, Himmler in his position of already controlled the SD and the Gestapo. On 17 June 1936 Himmler was named chief of all German police, thereby placing all uniformed police (Orpo) and criminal police (Kripo) in Germany under his control. In the latter role, he was nominally subordinate to the Interior Minister, Wilhelm Frick. It is not clear how much of this power would technically reside in the office of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; were those duties to be split up. These questions became moot by the time Himmler became the Interior Minister in 1943.

It is difficult to define precisely the full detailed duties and responsibilities of the beyond that of leader and senior member of the SS, since, in the words of historian Martin Windrow, &quot;by the outbreak of the (Second World) war it would have been impossible to define exactly the role within the state&quot; of the entire SS itself.

==Relationship with the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;==
The rank of was defined in the SS hierarchy as the highest possible rank of the . The exact position of the rank within the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; evolved over many years, ranging from clearly defined to vaguely associated. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was originally the small armed SS unit known as the (SS-VT), and in the 1930s was under the command of Himmler who, in his position as , issued directives and orders to SS-VT commanders. Hold-outs existed for some aspects of the armed SS however, as well as within the special bodyguard unit known as the . Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Sepp Dietrich was the real commander and handled its day-to-day administration.

The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; eventually grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions and served alongside the German Army, but was never formally part of it. During World War II, the authority of the over the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was mainly administrative in that certain General-SS offices controlled supply and logistics aspects of it. Himmler also held authority to create new &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; divisions as well as order the formation of various smaller SS combat units. The daily association with the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, however, encompassed primarily inspecting &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops and presenting high-ranking medals to its members.

The further never exercised direct operational authority over &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units until the very end of the war and then only through his capacity as an Army Group commander and not as the head of the SS. Top &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; commanders, such as Sepp Dietrich, Wilhelm Bittrich, and Matthias Kleinheisterkamp, further held a certain derision for Himmler, describing him as &quot;sly and unmilitary&quot;.

Attached to the office was the 18,438-strong SS formations managed by the (&quot;Command Staff &quot;) reporting directly to Himmler. To head the Command Staff, Himmler appointed career army officer Kurt Knoblauch, who acted as chief of staff for the units. Prior to the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, these formations included two motorized SS-Infantry Brigades, two SS-Cavalry Regiments combined into the SS Cavalry Brigade, a bodyguard battalion, flak units and a number of companies of support troops. Units were temporarily placed under army command for operations, but the could call them back at any time. Despite the name, it was not employed as a unified HQ unit. Instead, its individual units were sent to occupied areas, subordinated to local Higher SS and Police Leaders (HSSPFs) and used for so-called &quot;pacification actions&quot; alongside the . Often these actions were atrocities and mass murders, targeting Jews, political prisoners and &quot;suspected partisans&quot;.

==Office holders==
In all, five people held the title of during the twenty years of its existence. Three persons held the position as a title while two held the actual SS rank.



Hanke was appointed SS leader in April 1945, but not informed until early May. He was captured by Czech partisans on 6 May and interned. He was killed on 8 June, while attempting to escape a POW camp. Historians have often speculated that Reinhard Heydrich would have eventually held the rank had Himmler in some way been killed or removed from his position earlier in World War II, and indeed Heydrich was often seen as Himmler&#x27;s heir apparent by senior SS leaders. However, at a diplomatic function in Italy in 1941, Heydrich was reported as stating that he had no desire to succeed Himmler.

<text>The migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) is the most widespread locust species, and the only species in the genus Locusta. It occurs throughout Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Because of the vast geographic area it occupies, which comprises many different ecological zones, numerous subspecies have been described. However, not all experts agree on the validity of some of these subspecies. While it reaches plague proportions in drier areas, it is solitary in northern Australia savannas.

Many other species of grasshopper with gregarious and possibly migratory behaviour are referred to as &#x27;locusts&#x27; in the vernacular, including the widely distributed desert locust.

At 6.5 Gbp, the migratory locust possesses one of the largest known insect genomes.

==Polyphenism==
The migratory locust is polyphenic. It transitions between two main phenotypes in response to population density; the solitary phase and the gregarious phase. As the density of the population increases the locust transforms progressively from the solitary phase towards the gregarious phase with intermediate phases:

Pigmentation and size of the migratory locust vary according to its phase (gregarious or solitary form) and its age. Gregarious nymphs have a yellow to orange covering with black spots; solitary nymphs are green or brown. The gregarious adult is brownish with yellow, the latter colour becoming more intense and extensive on maturation. The solitary adult is brown with varying extent of green colour depending on the colour of the vegetation. Gregarious adults vary in size between 40 and 60 mm according to the sex; they are smaller than the solitary adults.

The phase transition may be mediated by DNA methylation in the brain. Expression of the DNA methyltrasferase gene &quot;Dnmt3&quot; is high in the brain of the gregarious form, decreases in gregarious locusts when they are isolated, and increases in solitary locusts when they are crowded. Knock-down reduces phase-related locomotor activity. Transcriptionally, &quot;Dnmt3&quot; is linked with phase-core transcriptional factor, hormone receptor HR3.

==Neurochemistry==
Increased extracellular K was found to cause membrane depolarization in muscle activating nerves by Hoyle 1953. This then in turn reduces the nerve potential, with the final result of reducing the force output of said muscle. He also found &quot;chronic&quot; cold temperatures to increase K in the haemolymph. These changes affect &quot;L. migratoria&quot;″s nerve states because as with insects and animals in general nerve cells have a high K permeability, which allows K&#x27;s transmembrane distribution to determine most cellular diffusion potential. This is shaping and will continue to shape the distribution of &quot;L. migratoria&quot;″s range under climate change.

==Relationship with humans==

===Economic impact===

Locusts are highly mobile, and usually fly with the wind at a speed of about . Swarms can travel 5 to 130 km or more in a day. Locust swarms can vary from less than one square kilometre to several hundred square kilometres with 40 to 80 million individuals per square kilometre. An adult locust can consume its own weight (several grams) in fresh food per day. For every million locusts, one ton of food is eaten.

In Africa, the last serious widespread plague of &quot;L. m. migratorioides&quot; occurred from 1928 to 1942. Since then, environmental transformations have made the development of swarms from the African migratory locust unlikely. Nevertheless, potential outbreaks are constantly monitored as plagues can be devastating.
The Malagasy migratory locust (&quot;L. m. capito&quot;) still regularly swarms (roughly twice every ten years). The desert locust, which is very similar to the African migratory locust, remains a major threat too.

Locust survey and control are primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture in locust-affected countries and are operations undertaken by national locust units. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations provides information on the general locust situation to all interested countries and gives warnings and forecasts to those countries in danger of invasion.

===As food ===
The migratory locust is an edible insect. In Europe, the migratory locust is officially approved for the use in food in Switzerland (since May 2017). On 2 July 2021, the European Food Safety Agency published a scientific opinion stating that the consumption of migratory locust in frozen, dried or ground state is safe for humans. On 12 November 2021, the EU member states gave their green light for the EU Commission to authorize the placing on the market of migratory locust as a food. This is one of the final steps in the novel food authorization procedure. As a next step, the Commission will now adopt a legal act.

==Subspecies of &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;==
&quot;L. migratoria&quot; is found over a vast geographic area, and its range covers many different ecological zones. Because of this, numerous subspecies have been described; however, not all experts agree on the validity of some of these subspecies.

* &quot;L. m. burmana&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. capito&quot; (Malagasy migratory locust: Madagascar)
* &quot;L. m. cinerascens&quot; (Italy, Spain)
* &quot;L. m. migratoria&quot; (europe)
* &quot;Locusta migratoria manilensis&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. migratorioides&quot; (African migratory locust: Africa and Atlantic islands)
* &quot;L. m. tibetensis&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. danica&quot; = &quot;L. m. migratoria&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. gallica&quot; = &quot;L. m. migratoria&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. solitaria&quot; = &quot;L. m. migratoria&quot; 

== Other species called &#x27;locusts&#x27; ==
Other species of Orthoptera that display gregarious and migratory behaviour are called &quot;locusts&quot;. This includes:

* American locust, &quot;Schistocerca americana&quot;
* Australian plague locust, &quot;Chortoicetes terminifera&quot;
* Bombay locust, &quot;Nomadacris succincta&quot;
* Brown locust, &quot;Locustana pardalina&quot;
* Desert locust, &quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;
* Egyptian locust, &quot;Anacridium aegyptium&quot;
* Italian locust, &quot;Calliptamus italicus&quot;
* Moroccan locust, &quot;Dociostaurus maroccanus&quot;
* Red locust, &quot;Nomadacris septemfasciata&quot;
* Rocky Mountain locust, &quot;Melanoplus spretus&quot; – extinct
* Sahelian tree locusts, &quot;Anacridium melanorhodon&quot;
* Spur-throated locust, &quot;Austracris guttulosa&quot; (note: &quot;spur-throated grasshoppers/locusts&quot; may also refer to spp. in other genera)
* Sudan plague locust, &quot;Aiolopus simulatrix&quot;

The Senegalese grasshopper (&quot;Oedaleus senegalensis&quot;) also often displays locust-like behaviour in the Sahel region.

<doc id="1118698" wikidata="Q499915" url="?curid=1118698" title="Edgard Colle">
<text>Edgard Colle (18 May 1897 – 19 April 1932) was a Belgian chess master. He scored excellent results in major international tournaments, including first at Amsterdam 1926, ahead of Savielly Tartakower and future world champion Max Euwe; first at Meran 1926, in a strong field ahead of Esteban Canal; and won twice outright at Scarborough in 1927, and again in 1930, ahead of Maróczy and Rubinstein.

Colle&#x27;s playing career was cut short by ill health. He survived three difficult operations for a gastric ulcer and died after a fourth at the age of 34 in Ghent.

Hans Kmoch wrote that Colle &quot;was not sentimental. He bore his sufferings as something quite private and of minor importance. He asked for no special consideration, he was always in good humor and a boon companion in company; but at the board he was a relentless fighter guided by a really ideal sense of duty and sportsmanship&quot;.

==Legacy==
Colle is remembered today primarily for his introduction of the chess opening now known as the Colle System: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3. White normally follows up with Bd3, 0-0, and Nbd2, playing for a central with e4. The opening is in effect a reversed Semi-Slav Defense. In response to ...c5 by Black, White typically plays c3. The Colle System was most often played in the late 1920s and 1930s. Colle himself played it from 1925 until his death in 1932. He won many games with the opening, including a number of . Colle–O&#x27;Hanlon, Nice 1930, featuring one of the best-known examples of a Greek gift sacrifice, is especially famous.

The opening gained popularity, especially in the United States, through the efforts of Belgian-American International Master George Koltanowski, who remained faithful to it throughout his long career, and wrote several books on it. Koltanowski said he played the opening as a tribute to his friend Colle. The opening is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Colle–Koltanowski&quot;.

The Colle System fell out of favor in high-level play as good defenses were found for Black. Chess theory today regards it as safe but somewhat passive. However, because of its solid pawn structure, logical piece placement, and coherent strategic aims, the opening is often taught to novice players as a safe and dependable way to reach a middlegame. Thus, the Colle System is frequently seen in amateur and scholastic tournaments, but is not common in professional play; however, it has been used in recent times by grandmasters Pia Cramling, Susan Polgar, Artur Yusupov, who prefers to play with b3 and a fianchetto, a setup known as the &quot;Colle–Zukertort&quot;, and, most notably, Magnus Carlsen.

<doc id="1118700" wikidata="Q5513835" url="?curid=1118700" title="General Motors B platform">
<text>The B platform (also known as the B body) is a full-size, rear-wheel drive, body-on-frame car platform, that was produced by General Motors (GM) from 1926 to 1996. Originally made for Oldsmobile and Buick, all of General Motors&#x27;s five main passenger car makes would use it at some point. It was closely related to the original rear-wheel drive C and D platforms, and was used for convertibles, hardtops, coupes, sedans, and station wagons. With approximately 12,960,000 units built, divided across four marques, the 1965–1970 B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T, and the Fiat 124 (and its licence-built copies, mainly classic Ladas).

Originally, the B platform was used for Buick and Oldsmobile products, with the A platform for Chevrolet and Oakland, and the C and D platforms devoted to Cadillac. During the General Motors companion make program, Vikings and Marquettes were also manufactured on this platform, as were La Salles from 1936 to 1940. The B platform became GM&#x27;s base model platform in 1958, when all existing Chevrolet products were upgraded to the B platform. 

The B platform was used for the Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo and Streamliner; the Oldsmobile L-Series, Series 70, and Series 88; the Buick Special and Century; the LaSalle Series 50; and the Cadillac Series 60, Series 61, and Series 63. 

For the 1959 model year, the previous A- and B-bodies were built on the new B platform that lasted until 1996. During this period, the B was the most modest of GM&#x27;s three full-sized platforms, slotting below the upscale C and the luxury D. The A platform designation would be resurrected by GM in 1964 for a new series of intermediate-sized cars including the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac Tempest, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Skylark.

==History==
The GM B platform was introduced in 1926 with the Buick Master Six, and the Oldsmobile Model 30, and had at least 12 major re-engineering and restyling efforts, for the 1937, 1939, 1941, 1949, 1954, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1977, and 1991 model years; along with interim styling changes for 1942, 1969, and 1980 that included new sheetmetal and revised rooflines. The platform was downsized in length by approximately 10 inches in 1977 and reduced in weight by an average of 800 pounds.

In 1991, the platform received its last major redesign, regaining several inches in length and featuring numerous frame improvements and reinforcements, while the shorter wheelbase remained unchanged. The last B-cars rolled off the line in 1996, leaving only Ford producing domestic large rear-wheel-drive sedans until the line was phased out in late 2011, with Chrysler reentering the market with their LX platform in 2005.

Known for being durable and reliable, most B-platform cars used suspensions utilizing coil springs in the front and leaf springs in the rear until 1958, when they switched to coils in the rear; one exception is the 1959–60 Oldsmobile 88, which used coil springs in front and multi-leaf springs in the rear. All B-platform cars since 1965 used perimeter frames with side rails, along with the 1961–64 B-platform Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles. The 1958–60 Buicks and 1959–60 Oldsmobiles used a ladder-type frame, while an X-frame without side rails was used on 1959–60 Pontiacs, 1959–64 Chevrolets, and 1961–64 Buicks.

The B platform was the last platform design to have the gasoline tank filler port behind the license plate after 1958. Exceptions included all station wagons, as well as all 1961–64 cars (which had the tank filler in the rear fender on the driver&#x27;s side) and 1965 Buicks (which had their fuel filler door above the license plate). Also, the B-platform vehicles from Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick from 1941 to 1948 had the fuel filler door in the rear fender on the driver&#x27;s side.

By 1986, the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Delta 88 moved to the GM H platform. And in 1991, Chairman Robert Stempel said: He also stated that the rear-wheel-drive 1992 Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice had been produced &quot;over my dead body.&quot; No direct successor for this platform was made after 1996, when the Roadmaster and Caprice ceased production. However, the Caprice would be revived and built on the Opel-developed V platform for the Middle East but built by Holden, while years later, the Caprice for police use along with the Impala SS successor, the Chevrolet SS, would return to the United States, built on the GM Zeta platform developed by Holden in Australia.

<text>Musicians United for Safe Energy, or MUSE, is an activist group founded in 1979 by Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, Harvey Wasserman and John Hall. The group advocates against the use of nuclear energy, forming shortly after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in March 1979. MUSE organized a series of five No Nukes concerts held at Madison Square Garden in New York in September 1979. On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the Battery Park City landfill in New York.

Other musicians performing at the concerts included Crosby, Stills and Nash, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, the Doobie Brothers, Jesse Colin Young, Gil Scott-Heron, Tom Petty, Dan Fogelberg, Poco and others. The album &quot;No Nukes&quot;, and a film, also titled &quot;No Nukes&quot;, were both released in 1980 to document the performances. A full No Nukes concert featuring Browne and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash was also filmed near the beach in Ventura, California, at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, but none of that footage made it into the final cut.

In the 2006 midterm elections, Hall was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district, on a platform that included intensive investment in alternative energy. He defeated the incumbent, Sue Kelly.

In 2007, Raitt, Nash, and Browne, as part of the No Nukes group, recorded a music video of the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;.

Thirty two years after the No Nukes concert in New York, on August 7, 2011, a MUSE benefit concert was held at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA. to raise money for MUSE and for Japanese tsunami/nuclear disaster relief. Artists included Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Graham Nash, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Kitaro, Jason Mraz, Sweet Honey in the Rock, the Doobie Brothers, Tom Morello, and Jonathan Wilson. The show was powered off-grid.

<doc id="1118714" wikidata="Q1002745" url="?curid=1118714" title="Buick Estate">
<text>Buick Estate is a nameplate that was used by the Buick division of General Motors, denoting its luxury full-size station wagon from 1940 to 1964 and from 1970 to 1996. The Estate nameplate was derived from the term country estate in wealthy suburban areas and estate car, the British term for a station wagon.

For much of its model life the Buick Estate was produced using GM B platform as the station wagon counterpart of Buick sedans; it was offered on the GM C platform from 1949–1953, then again from 1971–1976. With the exception of the prewar Buick Limited limousine, the Estate was the largest vehicle of the Buick line, combining the luxury features of Buick sedans with cargo-carrying capabilities. In line with other brands having a wagon-associated moniker, Estate became adopted by other Buick wagons (regardless of size), with the exceptions of the 1964–1972 Buick Sport Wagon and the 1982–1989 Buick Skyhawk station wagon.

Starting with model year 1947 until 1964, the Estate was offered as a station wagon on two model lines. When it returned in 1970, it was the senior station wagon to the Sport Wagon, then the name was again used on two different models in 1973 when the Sport Wagon was replaced with the intermediate-sized Buick Century Estate.

As the Cadillac Division did not offer a factory-produced station wagon in North America until 2010 (the Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon), the Buick Estate served as the flagship station wagon entry from General Motors, slotted slightly above its Oldsmobile divisional counterpart, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser beginning in 1971. Competing against the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and the Mercury Colony Park, the Estate was originally produced as a wooden-body station wagon (&quot;woodie&quot;); from 1970 to 1996, nearly all examples were fitted with simulated woodgrain exterior trim (though technically optional). The 1996 Buick Roadmaster Estate (alongside its Chevrolet Caprice counterpart) was the full-size station wagon to remain in production and the last to offer exterior woodgrain trim. In 1976 American Motors Corporation introduced the Jeep Grand Wagoneer with similar passenger accommodation, luxury standard equipment and a simulated woodgrain appearance built on a dedicated chassis.

Following the 1996 model year, Buick discontinued the Roadmaster Estate and mid-size Century Estate station wagons, ending the use of the nameplate. Buick would not market another station wagon in the United States until 2018, rebranding the Opel Insignia as the Buick Regal TourX.

==1940s==

The first Buick Estate station wagon was a large-bodied wheelbase GM C platform Buick Super introduced mid-year only for 1940 with a wooden body, the same year the wooden-body station wagon Packard One-Ten was first introduced. The 1940 Super Estate was very exclusive and was installed with the second largest engine offered at the time, with a retail price of US$1,242 ($ in dollars ) while the limousine Buick Limited manufactured 1,739 for a listed retail price of US$2,199 ($ in dollars ) with similar length and interior comfort. The appearance of the wood panels using both mahogany panels with oak trim was different from other wagons that used one source of wood. Production totals record that 495 found buyers at the same time the 4-door Touring Sedan sold 95,875 and 4,764 convertible coupes were made. Earlier in 1934 a two-door shooting brake was offered on the Buick Series 50 by special request. In 1942 all GM vehicles had an appearance upgrade where the trailing edge of the front fender was extended across the front doors that was called &quot;Airfoil&quot; accented by parallel chrome strips on the front and rear fenders on Buick vehicles. In later years the character line of the &quot;Airfoil&quot; feature was accented with a stainless-steel strip that evolved into the Buick Sweepspear for several decades.

The introduction of a station wagon was a novel body style as GM first introduced it in 1939 for the Chevrolet Master, 1940 for the Oldsmobile Series 60 and 1937 for the Pontiac Streamliner and all used wooden body panels for the passenger compartment. 1935 was the year the Chevrolet Suburban carryall/panel truck was built with an all-steel body on a truck-based chassis and offered a choice of side-hinged rear panel doors, or a rear tailgate/lift window could be selected for cargo area access while only offering two side mounted doors, resembling a cargo van that could seat up to eight passengers. 1937 was also the year Packard first offered a station wagon on the junior series Packard Six Model 115-C. Buick and Packard had a professional rivalry and the introduction of the Packard Station Wagon was an opportunity Buick leadership saw to offer one for Buick. In 1946 the Willys Jeep Station Wagon was introduced with a similar passenger accommodation and load carrying capability.
For 1941 and 1942, Buick switched to the GM B platform Special continuing to offer the wheelbase while the Oldsmobile Series 60 continued to use the shortest A-body. 1940 is also the year the station wagon returned to Packard on the luxurious Packard One-Twenty which also had a wheelbase. The retail price for the Special Estate was US$1,463 ($ in dollars ) and a similar production total of 838 were produced, while the Touring Sedan made 91,138. In 1941 the Chrysler Windsor Town &amp; Country station wagon was introduced shortly thereafter.

Later after automobile production resumed at the end of World War II, the Estate returned to Buick&#x27;s C platform Super and Roadmaster for the 1946–49 model years and a long tradition of contracting the station wagon body style was provided by Ionia Manufacturing, also known as Mitchell-Bentley Corporation that today is called, Mitchell Corporation, which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964 instead of GM&#x27;s Fisher Body. 

The 1946 Super Estate was listed at US$2,594 ($ in dollars ) and production total of 786 were produced while still offering the wheelbase. Packard didn&#x27;t offer a competitive appearance station wagon until 1948 with the Packard Station Sedan.

For model year 1947, the Estate Station Wagon body style was offered on both the Super and Roadmaster models, with the Super being the more modestly equipped and the Roadmaster being the luxury version, while both offered the wooden body panels.

==1950s==

The 1950 through 1953 Estate continued using the Super and Roadmaster &quot;C&quot; platform, then in 1954 to 1958 it was offered on the shorter B platform Century and Special, with all steel bodies, shared with the Oldsmobile 88.

Due to the high maintenance required of the genuine wood veneer panels requiring a coat of varnish to keep the durability and appearance, the use of wood gradually decreased until 1950 when it was not much more than window surround for the exterior while more modestly used inside where the wood was protected from the elements. The Estate for 1950 was offered on the Super and Roadmaster, while the Roadmaster was offered with two trim packages called Model 79 Estate Wagon and the Model 79R Deluxe Estate Wagon, the latter offering leather upholstery, a carpeted cargo area and the first time power windows and power adjustable front seat were available. 

It was installed with the largest engine available in the top-level Roadmaster, which was the Fireball Straight-eight engine that necessitated the long wheelbase. Production numbers for both continued to be modest, with the Super Estate manufacturing 2,480 in comparison to 114,745 Super Riviera Sedan, with a listed retail price of US$2,480 ($ in dollars ) while the Roadmaster Estate and Roadmaster Deluxe Estate had a combined production of 420 and a listed retail price of US$3,433 ($ in dollars ) making the Deluxe Estate the most expensive Buick for that year.

Production numbers of the Estate had remained small since it was introduced, and Buick changed the platform used a few times in an attempt to stimulate sales, and in 1955 the Estate had its most popular year with a combined total of 7,195, with the breakdown of 2,952 Special Estate with the last year of the Fireball Straight-eight engine at a listed retail price of US$2,974 ($ in dollars ) and 4,243 for the Century Special and US$3,175 ($ in dollars ), installing the all-new &quot;Fireball&quot; V8. &quot;Cordaveen&quot; upholstery began to be installed in various configurations beginning in the mid-1950s with cloth inserts on higher trim packages.

Later during the 50s, the fashionable hardtop body style was introduced on the Century Caballero Estate Wagons that were offered only in 1957 and 1958 and was shared with the Oldsmobile 88 Fiesta hardtop station wagon. The hardtop feature was also offered on the Special Riviera Estate Wagon and sold 6,817 with a listed retail price of US$3,167 ($ in dollars ), while the Century Caballero Estate Wagon sold 10,186 with a listed retail price of US$3,706 ($ in dollars ), leading in sales against the Chrysler New Yorker Town &amp; Country and Mercury Colony Park.

==1960s==

In 1959 the LeSabre Estate was introduced on the B platform. Beginning in 1959 the intermediate Invicta Estate was offered with a listed retail price of US$3,841 ($ in dollars ) while the junior LeSabre station wagon was listed at US$3,320 ($ in dollars ).

The Estate station wagons received a &quot;Cordaveen&quot; vinyl interior as standard, with the Saran Balfour cloth/Cordaveen combination interior available as an option in several colors. Engines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available. The three Ventiports returned to the side of the front fender denoting the junior-level status in Buick&#x27;s hierarchy of products offered.

The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models. Replacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter. Inside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.

For 1963, the Invicta series had a 6-passenger station wagon as its sole model. Only 3,495 Invicta Estate station wagons were built for 1963, after which the name disappeared, when it was replaced by the Buick Wildcat hardtop coupe or sedan. The Estate Wagon was replaced by the new, smaller A platform Buick Sport Wagon, making the B-body Chevrolet Impala Estate and Pontiac Safari the only full-sized GM station wagons until 1970.


==1970==
The Buick Estate Wagon was reintroduced as the top-level luxury station wagon for GM in 1970 to compete against the Mercury Colony Park and Chrysler New Yorker Town &amp; Country. Buick&#x27;s first full-sized station wagon since 1964, it was available as a separate series on the B-body LeSabre chassis, sharing their wheelbase, basic body and interior and took the senior position above the Buick Sport Wagon mid-sized station wagon. From 1967 until the Estate returned in 1970, GM&#x27;s most upscale full-sized station wagon offering simulated woodgrained paneling was the Pontiac Executive Safari station wagon and Chevrolet Caprice Custom Estate. By special request from coachbuilders like ASC and Traditional Coachworks of Chatsworth, California the Cadillac Fleetwood was modified as a station wagon after the donor vehicle was completed.

The Estate returned to an earlier tradition during the 1940s and 1950s of positioning it as a luxury vehicle similar to the top-level Electra 225, with full power amenities, air conditioning and the available AM/FM radio, and included an optional roof installed luggage rack with a vinyl roof covering available. To accommodate various load duties, the second row bench seat had a 60/40 split for additional passengers and cargo while using the Buick 455 V8 for effortless driving. The listed retail price was US$5,047 ($ in dollars ) and 28,306 were manufactured

The LeSabre Custom&#x27;s bright rocker, wheelhouse and rear lower fender moldings were used. Reviving a late 1940s &quot;woodie&quot; appearance Woodgrain using DI-NOC a vinyl wood-grained wrap was an option for the body sides, incorporating the traditional &quot;Sweepspear&quot; feature. Interiors were &quot;Cordaveen&quot; in the more upscale Custom trim package. Despite being on the B-body it shared the C-body division flagship Electra&#x27;s luxurious accommodations and standard equipment and four VentiPorts on the front fenders. The following year the Estate would move up to Electra&#x27;s larger body and more voluminous interior.

Adopting the interior layout of the intermediate Sport Wagon, the Estate used a rear facing third-row seat. With a total of eight-passenger accommodation (similar to the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban of the time), the first-generation Estate wagon was among the largest vehicles ever built by Buick.


== 1971–1976==
The 1971 to 1976 Estates were the first Buick station wagons to be built on GM longest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate shared its C-body wheelbase with the Electra 225, while all 1971–76 GM wagons were B-body-based per model numbers. The 1971–76 GM full-size bodies, at front shoulder room and rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid 1990s. The Estate also shared the Electra 225&#x27;s interior and exterior styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). Door trim and seats were not as plush in 1971–74 wagons and no door pull strap was included as it was on the Electra.

Although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre&#x27;s (as was door trim and seats), the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. The taillights were different from both the LeSabre and the Electra in all of these years. The Estate Wagons, as with other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars to better cope with load carrying duties.

The Estate Wagons also featured a new &#x27;clamshell&#x27; tailgate design, marketed as the &quot;Glide-away Tailgate,&quot; where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the lower tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower tailgate was supplanted by the power tailgate. The tailgate system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged tailgate, the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the open cargo area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces. the rear seat could be folded flat for additional cargo and incorporated a 60/40 split so that extended cargo and passengers could be accommodated and providing entry to the third row seat. Cargo capacity with the second row seats folded was 184 cubic feet. If passengers were seated in the optional forward facing third row seat, the rear window could be retracted into the roof while the vehicle was in motion with the tailgate in place.

In its first year, 24,034 Estate Wagons were sold with a listed retail price of US$5,414 ($ in dollars ).

At shipping weight, or about curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Estate Wagons are easily the heaviest Buicks ever built, even heavier than the Buick Limited limousines of 1936–42. The 1975 and 1976 models were the longest station wagons ever built.

The Estate used the Buick 455 V8 from 1971 through 1976 found in the Buick GSX. The Stage One high performance version, with high lift camshaft, enlarged ports, enlarged valves, and dual exhaust, was available as an option through 1974.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.


== 1977–1990==
In 1977, the Buick Estate was downsized and relaunched on General Motors&#x27; B-body. In 1979, an Estate Wagon Limited was offered with many previously extra cost options now included as standard in addition to the Estate Wagon. To further differentiate the Limited model, fenders included four VentiPorts (up from three) and the interior had velour upholstery with loose pillow designed seating or vinyl with leather available in later years. Production records show 21,312 were built for 1979. An appearance change was introduced for the simulated woodgrain changing from mahogany to oak which was used for several decades. Cargo capacity with the second row seats in place was 87.9 cubic feet and the core chassis elements remained in use until 1996 when the GM station wagon production was terminated. When the Estate Wagon was introduced it had a shorter wheelbase than the 1964 Buick Sport Wagon.

The tradition of luxury continued with power windows, power adjustable drivers split bench seat, six speaker stereo system, dual power adjustable side view mirrors, Touch Climate Control air conditioning, GM&#x27;s Twilight Sentinel automatic headlight activation and other luxury features found on the Buick Electra. The 1977 listed retail price was $6,078 ($ in dollars ) with the optional rear facing third row seat, while the &quot;Dual-Action&quot; tailgate was now standard equipment with a power retractable rear window on all GM station wagons.

In 1980, body changes made the wagon more aerodynamic for better fuel efficiency. Also, that year, the Electra Estate Wagon was introduced and replaced the Estate Wagon Limited while the &#x27;base&#x27; model was now called LeSabre Estate Wagon. Exterior woodgrain applique was standard on the Electra Estate (but could be deleted for credit) and optional on the LeSabre Estate. The Buick 350 V8 engine was dropped from the options list and a 5.7 litre diesel 350 V8 was now available through 1985. The standard engine was the 5.0 litre Oldsmobile 307 V8.

Although the Electra and LeSabre coupes and sedans had both switched to new front wheel drive platforms by 1986, the model names also continued to be used on the rear-wheel-drive wagons through 1989 making the Estate the largest rear wheel drive Buick offered.

For 1990, which would be the Estate&#x27;s final year, the Electra and LeSabre model designations were dropped, and the car was once again sold simply as the Estate Wagon. As with the Electra Estate in previous years, standard exterior woodgrain could be deleted for credit. Although the Estate Wagon model was discontinued in 1990, the Estate trim designation continued on the full-size Roadmaster station wagons from 1991 to 1996. The Estate name was also applied to the top trim level of the mid-size Century station wagon (sold as the Regal Estate station wagon in 1982 and 1983) and often included exterior woodgrain applique. Like the Roadmaster, the Century Estate continued to be sold through 1996.

Production Figures

==1991–1996==
For 1991, Buick revised its nameplate offerings. The stand-alone Estate Wagon was retired, as Buick reintroduced the Roadmaster nameplate as its new full-size line (replacing the Electra, but not the Park Avenue). While last used in 1958, the Roadmaster line again offered an Roadmaster Estate station wagon for the first time since 1953. 

The B-body chassis underpinnings from 1977 returned with evolutionary upgrades, with a complete redesign of the body and interior. Introduced a model year before the Roadmaster sedan, the Roadmaster Estate shared its body with the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser and the Chevrolet Caprice station wagon. 

GM discontinued the Roadmaster Estate in 1996, ending production on December 13 of that year, the last traditional full-sized American station wagon. All 1996 Roadmaster Estates were installed with a &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; hood ornament, a round medallion in place of the traditional tri-shield Buick badge.

=== Body design ===
Sharing nearly its entire body with the Custom Cruiser, both model lines were distinguished from their Chevrolet counterpart by a fixed &quot;Vista Roof&quot; skylight over the second row seats (a design feature revived from the 1960s Buick Sport Wagon). In contrast to the two-tone exterior paint of the Custom Cruiser, the Roadmaster Estate was styled with exterior wood paneling (notably, the 1953 Roadmaster Estate was the final factory-built American station wagon with a wooden body). Though sharing its headlights with the Caprice and the Custom Cruiser, the Roadmaster Estate was fitted with a rectangular waterfall-style grille (not shared with its sedan counterpart). 

To improve aerodynamics (and fuel economy) over the previous generation, the rear of the body was styled with a sloped, semi-fastback rear windowline (similar to the 1970s &quot;clamshell tailgate&quot;), presenting a series of design challenges. In place of a rear hatchback door (similar to the Buick Century or the Ford Taurus station wagons), the B-body station wagons retained a two-way rear tailgate. In place of the previous retractable rear window, a hatchback rear window was installed, including a top-mounted rear windshield wiper/washer system as standard equipment. For vehicles with the optional third-row (rear-facing) seat, vent windows were installed next to the D-pillars. 

=== Powertrain ===
Coinciding with the 1991 redesign of the B-platform, GM retired its use of divisionally-developed engines (outside of Cadillac), with the Chevrolet small-block V8 becoming used for all GM full-size cars and light trucks. For 1991, the Roadmaster Estate was fitted with a 170hp 5.0L L03 V8; replacing the carbureted Oldsmobile 5.0L V8 (307), the new V8 brought a substantial power increase and fuel injection. For 1992, the model line adopted the 180hp 5.7L L05 V8. For 1994, the standard engine became a 5.7L sequential point fuel-injection LT1 V8, increasing output to 260hp; the Roadmaster shared this engine with the Impala SS, Caprice 9C1, and the Cadillac Fleetwood (an aluminum-head version was used by the Corvette C4, Camaro Z28, and Firebird Trans-Am). GM last offered a high-performance V8 engine in a station wagon in 1974. 

=== Utility ===
When ordered with the factory towing package, the station wagon could accommodate with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a rear limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory-installed self-leveling rear suspension called Dynaride, which consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan-driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.

<doc id="1118718" wikidata="Q374221" url="?curid=1118718" title="Transit-oriented development">
<text>In urban planning, transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. It promotes a symbiotic relationship between dense, compact urban form and public transport use. In doing so, TOD aims to increase public transport ridership by reducing the use of private cars and by promoting sustainable urban growth.

TOD typically includes a central transit stop (such as a train station, or light rail or bus stop) surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area, with lower-density areas spreading out from this center, serving as part of an integrated transport network. TOD is also typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, by using smaller block sizes and reducing the land area dedicated to automobiles. In some areas, it may include ferries. Areas that center a transit station as a hub while building residential-focused TOD development in the immediate area are known as transit villages.

The densest areas of TOD are normally located within a radius of to mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, thus solving the last mile problem.

==Description==
Many of the new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France have many of the characteristics of TOD communities. In a sense, nearly all communities built on reclaimed land in the Netherlands or as exurban developments in Denmark have had the local equivalent of TOD principles integrated in their planning, including the promotion of bicycles for local use.

In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs. A half mile (800 m) corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes at and is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station. The half-mile ring is a little more than in size.

Transit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning officials from &quot;transit-proximate development&quot; because it contains specific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and differentiate the development from urban sprawl. A few examples of these features include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day, excellent pedestrian facilities such as high quality pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node. Another key feature of transit-oriented development that differentiates it from &quot;transit-proximate development&quot; is reduced amounts of parking for personal vehicles.

Transit-oriented development has many benefits including but not limited to:
* Easy access to transit, making it easy to get around without a car.
* Dense, due to TODs being made for getting around transportation, other than private vehicles, allowing access to stores and private business.
* Improved access to jobs and city services.
* Increased population near transit stops, such as a commuter rail stop, which ultimately increases transit ridership across the board.

Opponents of compact, or transit oriented development typically argue that Americans, and persons throughout the world, prefer low-density living, and that any policies that encourage compact development will result in substantial utility decreases and hence large social welfare costs. Proponents of compact development argue that there are large, often unmeasured benefits of compact development or that the American preference for low-density living is a misinterpretation made possible in part by substantial local government interference in the land market.

==In cities==
Many cities throughout the world are developing TOD policy. Toronto, Portland, Montreal, San Francisco, and Vancouver among many other cities have developed, and continue to write policies and strategic plans, which aim to reduce automobile dependency and increase the use of public transit.

===Latin America===
====Curitiba, Brazil====
One of the earliest and most successful examples of TOD is Curitiba, Brazil.
Curitiba was organized into transport corridors very early on in its history. Over the years, it has integrated its zoning laws and transportation planning to place high-density development adjacent to high-capacity transportation systems, particularly its BRT corridors. Since the failure of its first rather grandiose city plan due to lack of funding, Curitiba has focused on working with economical forms of infrastructure, so it has arranged unique adaptations, such as bus routes (inexpensive infrastructure) with routing systems, limited access and speeds similar to subway systems. The source of innovation in Curitiba has been a unique form of participatory city planning that emphasizes public education, discussion and agreement.

====Guatemala City, Guatemala====

In an attempt to control the rapid growth of Guatemala City, the long-time mayor, Álvaro Arzú, implemented a plan to control growth based on transects along important arterial roads and exhibiting transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics. The plan adopted POT (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow the construction of taller mixed-use building structures right by large arterial roads. The buildings would gradually decrease in height and density as distance would increase from arterial roads. That is being implemented simultaneously with a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, called Transmetro.

====Mexico City, Mexico====

Mexico City has battled pollution for years. Many attempts have been made to orient citizens towards public transportation. Expansion of metro line, both subway and bus, have been instrumental. Following the example of Curitiba, many bus-lines were created on many of Mexico City&#x27;s most important streets. The bus-line has taken two lanes from cars to be used only by the bus-line, increasing the flow for bus transit. The city has also made great attempts at increasing the number of bike lanes, including shutting down entire roads on certain days to be used only by bikers.

Car regulations have also increased in the city. New regulations prevent old cars from driving in the city, other cars from driving on certain days. Electric cars are allowed to be driven every day and have free parking. Decreasing the public space allocated to cars and increasing regulations have become a great annoyance among daily car users. The city hopes to push people to use more public transport.

===North America===

====Canada====
All major Canadian cities have transit oriented development policies and implementations. The main purposes of these policies has been to kerb suburban sprawl, and to increase housing supply amidst a housing crisis. In addition, it comes in response to a shifting population demographic that prefers high density living.

Some cities, such as Toronto, Ottawa, and especially Vancouver, have a long history of building new communities near transit, and they often plan development and rapid transit simultaneously. Others, such as Calgary and Montréal, have only implemented TOD policies recently, and there is some debate as to whether it is better to build new transit to existing high density neighbourhoods, or build high density neighbourhoods near existing transit.

=====Calgary, Alberta=====
Calgary&#x27;s Transit Oriented Development (TOD) has been evolving largely around stations along Calgary&#x27;s Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, also known as the CTrain network. Although Calgary&#x27;s CTrain system has been around since 1981, TOD activity has been fairly recent, with much of development taking place since 2010. Most of the transit oriented development has taken place along the LRT system&#x27;s Red Line especially around stations of the northwest leg with areas around stations at Brentwood, Dalhousie, and Banff Trail having seen the most development. Brentwood Station for example, with multi-building developments such as University City, has seen almost 900 residential units built in the last eight years within the 600m radius of Brentwood station, as well as proposed developments that are in the works. On the south leg of the Red Line the massive Midtown Station proposal is a reversal from previous TOD builds where development is built around existing stations. In the case of Midtown Station, the proposal is along the CTrain line, but includes building a new station solely for the purpose of serving the development.

For The City of Calgary, TOD&#x27;s are an ongoing process, but the city has published policy guidelines and implementation strategies for Transit Oriented Development.

=====Edmonton, Alberta=====
Most of the suburban high rises were not along major rail lines like other cities until recently, when there has been incentive to do so. Century Park is a growing condo community in southern Edmonton at the south end of the Edmonton LRT system. It will include low to high rise condos, recreational services, shops, restaurants, and a fitness centre. Edmonton has also had a transit-proximate development for some time in the northeastern suburbs at Clareview which includes a large park and ride, and low rise apartments among big box stores and associated power center parking. Edmonton is also looking into some new TODs in various parts of the city. In the northeast, there are plans to redevelop underutilized land at two sites around existing LRT, Fort Road and Stadium station. In the west, there is plans to have some medium density condos in the Glenora neighborhood along a future LRT route as well as a TOD in the southeast in the Strathearn neighborhood along the same future LRT on existing low rise apartments.

===== Kitchener-Waterloo =====
The Ion light rail line in Kitchener-Waterloo initiated large amounts of new construction along the corridor, despite the city region being the smallest in North America to host a tramway. The first stage of the line created 19 000 new housing units along its length, as well as large scale industrial and commercial developments, valued at $5 billion.

=====Montreal, Quebec=====

According to the Metropolitan Development and Planning Regulation as of late 2011, 40% of new households will be built as TOD neighborhoods.

=====Ottawa, Ontario=====
Ottawa encourages high density development within 600m of all rapid transit stations, including both the bus rapid transit Transitway and the city&#x27;s urban rail system, with the goal of creating feature complete mixed use communities within walking distance to transit. The city simultaneously discourages auto oriented development, such as parking lots, in the same areas.

This has had the effect of creating many tower clusters far outside the city centre, with stations like Lincoln Fields and Lycée Claudel having entire neighbourhoods appear around them.

=====Toronto, Ontario=====
Toronto has a longstanding policy of encouraging new construction along the route of its primary Yonge Street subway line. Most notable are the development of the Yonge and Eglinton area in the 1960s and 1970s; and the present development of the 2 km of the Yonge Street corridor north of Sheppard Avenue, which began in the late 1980s. In the period since 1997 alone the latter stretch has seen the appearance of a major new shopping centre and the building and occupation of over twenty thousand new units of condominium housing. Since the opening of the Sheppard subway line in 2002, there is a condominium construction boom along the route on Sheppard Avenue East between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road.

In addition to the subway, transit oriented development has also started to be prioritised for regional rail stations, such as East Harbour GO.

=====Vancouver, British Columbia=====
Vancouver has a strong history of creating new development around its SkyTrain lines and building regional town centres at major stations and transit corridors. In addition, the Government of British Columbia has legislated policy that all development within 800m of rail, and within 400m of bus interchanges, must be high density. Of note is the Metrotown area of the suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia near the Metrotown SkyTrain Station. The areas around stations have spurred the development of billions of dollars of high-density real estate, with multiple high-rises near the many stations, prompting concerns about rapid gentrification.

=====Winnipeg, Manitoba=====
There is currently one TOD being built in Winnipeg beside the rapid transit corridor. It is known as The Yards at Fort Rouge, and was spearheaded by the developer Gem Equities. In phase two of the southwest rapid transit corridor, there will be four more TODs. This phase is an interesting example of the use of fine arts in parallel with transit planning, making several of the stations sites for public art related to the social history of the area.

====United States====

=====Arlington County, Virginia=====

For over 30 years, the government has pursued a development strategy of concentrating much of its new development within from the county&#x27;s Washington Metro rapid transit stations and the high-volume bus lines of Columbia Pike. Within the transit areas, the government has a policy of encouraging mixed-use and pedestrian- and transit-oriented development. Some of these &quot;urban village&quot; communities include Rosslyn, Ballston, Clarendon, Courthouse, Pentagon City, Crystal City, Lyon Village, Shirlington, Virginia Square, and Westover.

In 2002, Arlington received the EPA&#x27;s National Award for Smart Growth Achievement for &quot;Overall Excellence in Smart Growth&quot; — the first ever granted by the agency.

In September 2010, Arlington County, Virginia, in partnership with Washington, D.C., opened Capital Bikeshare, a bicycle sharing system. By February 2011, Capital Bikeshare had 14 stations in the Pentagon City, Potomac Yard, and Crystal City neighborhoods in Arlington. Arlington County also announced plans to add 30 stations in fall 2011, primarily along the densely populated corridor between the Rosslyn and Ballston neighborhoods, and 30 more in 2012.

===== New Jersey =====
New Jersey has become a national leader in promoting Transit Village development through a program known as the Transit Village initiative. The New Jersey Department of Transportation established the Transit Village Initiative in 1999, offering multi-agency assistance and grants from the annual $1 million Transit village fund to any municipality with a ready to go project specifying appropriate mixed land-use strategy, available property, station-area management, and commitment to affordable housing, job growth, and culture. Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings. Transit Village districts are defined by the half mile radius surrounding the transit station. To become a Transit Village, towns must meet the following criteria: have existing transit, demonstrate a willingness to grow, adopt a transit-oriented-development redevelopment plan or zoning ordinance, identify specific TOD sites and projects, identify bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and identify &quot;place making&quot; efforts near the transit station, such as community events, celebrations, and other cultural or artistic events.

Since 1999 the state has made 35 Transit Village designations, which are in different stages of development:

Pleasantville (1999), Morristown (1999), Rutherford (1999), South Amboy (1999), South Orange (1999), Riverside (2001), Rahway (2002), Metuchen (2003), Belmar (2003), Bloomfield (2003), Bound Brook (2003), Collingswood (2003), Cranford (2003), Matawan (2003), New Brunswick (2005), Journal Square/Jersey City (2005), Netcong (2005), Elizabeth/Midtown (2007), Burlington City (2007), the City of Orange Township (2009), Montclair (2010), Somerville (2010), Linden (2010), West Windsor (2012), East Orange (2012), Dunellen (2012), Summit (2013), Plainfield (2014), Park Ridge (2015), Irvington (2015), Hackensack (2016), Long Branch (2016), Asbury Park (2017), Newark (2021), and Atlantic City (2023).

=====New York City=====

Many neighborhoods in New York City are close to a New York City Subway station, this allows easy transport throughout the cities’ neighborhoods and central business districts. To maximize the usage of the New York City Subway, many subway stations are surrounded by transit-oriented development, with high-density residential and commercial buildings surrounding the subway station. Neighborhoods include, but are not limited to, Downtown Brooklyn, Midtown Manhattan, Long Island City, and Sunnyside. Many downtowns in the Greater New York Area also are walkable with a central regional rail station.

=====Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania=====
The East Liberty neighborhood is nearing completion of a $150 million Transit Oriented Development centered around the reconfigured East Liberty Station on the city&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway. The development included improved access to the station with a new pedestrian bridge and pedestrian walkways that increase the effective walkshed of the station. The East Busway is a fixed guideway route that offers riders an 8-minute ride from East Liberty to Pittsburgh&#x27;s Downtown.

=====Salt Lake City Metro Area, Utah=====
The Salt Lake City Metro Area has seen a strong proliferation of transit-oriented developments due to the construction of new transit lines within the Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s TRAX, &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and streetcar lines. New developments in West Valley, Farmington, Murray, Provo, Kaysville, Sugarhouse and downtown Salt Lake City have seen rapid growth and construction despite the economic downturn. The population along the Wasatch Front has reached 2.5 million and is expected to grow 50% over the next two decades. At 29.8%, Utah&#x27;s population growth more than doubled the population growth of the nation (13.2%), with a vast majority of this growth occurring along the Wasatch Front.

Transportation infrastructure has been vastly upgraded in the past decade as a result of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and the need to support the growth in population. This has created a number of transit-oriented commercial and residential projects to be proposed and completed.

=====San Francisco Bay Area, California=====
The San Francisco Bay Area includes nine counties and 101 cities, including San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland and Fremont. Local and regional governments encourage transit-oriented development to decrease traffic congestion, protect natural areas, promote public health and increase housing options. The region has designated and . Current population forecasts for the region predict that it will grow by 2 million people by 2035 due to both the natural birth rate and job creation, and estimate that 50% of this growth can be accommodated in Priority Development Areas through transit-oriented development.

Major transit village projects have been developed over the past 20 years at several stations linked to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. In their 1996 book, &quot;Transit Villages in the 21st Century&quot;, Michael Bernick and Robert Cervero identified emerging transit villages at several BART stations, including Pleasant Hill / Contra Costa Centre, Fruitvale, Hayward and Richmond. MacArthur Station is a relatively new development, with construction beginning in 2011 and scheduled for completion after 2019.

=====Chicago=====
Chicago passed its first TOD ordinances in 2013. The city of Chicago started building TODs around rail stations throughout the metropolitan area. There have been concerns that these TODs were excluding minorities since most of the TODs were built in mainly white areas therefore leaving minorities out of the picture when it came to access to transit oriented development neighborhoods. The 2020 eTOD Policy Plan was created to fix the issues from the previous TOD plans, by creating more TOD developments in minority areas.

===Asia and Oceania===

====Hong Kong====
Compared to other developed economies, the car ownership rate in Hong Kong is very low, and approximately 90% of all trips are made by public transport.

In the mid-20th century, no railway was built until an area was well developed. However, in recent decades, Hong Kong has started to have some TODs, where a railway is built simultaneously with residential development above or nearby, dubbed the &quot;Rail plus Property&quot; (R+P) Model. Examples include:

* LOHAS Park
* Olympian City
* Tung Chung
* Union Square
The Rail plus Property model, which captures the value capture of land surrounding new public transport, allows Hong Kong to be one of the world&#x27;s few profitable public transit systems, generating a profit of $1.5 billion in 2014.

====Malaysia====

Bandar Malaysia is an upcoming development by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

====Indonesia====
Transit oriented development (TOD) areas are urban areas designed to integrate transit functions with people, activities, buildings and public spaces that aim to optimize access to public transportation. In Jakarta, PT MRT Jakarta (Perseroda) will build TOD areas at five points along the south-north corridor of MRT Jakarta. The five points are Blok M, Lebak Bulus and Fatmawati in South Jakarta, as well as Dukuh Atas and Istora Senayan in Central Jakarta. Each area has its own theme and concept according to the characteristics and needs of the local community. The TOD area is expected to provide benefits to the community, such as reducing congestion and air pollution, increasing a healthy and active lifestyle, expanding employment and economic opportunities, and creating added value for property. 

One example of the Dukuh Atas TOD is the transport hub that is being built by PT Moda Integrasi Transportasi Jabodetabek (MITJ) on Jalan Blora, in front of Sudirman Station. Transport hubs are vehicle exchange points and transit points where there is community interaction using transit. This transport hub will be a 20-storey building containing the Jakarta MRT office and other facilities. This transport hub will also be connected to the 250-meter Multipurpose Crossing Bridge (JPM) which connects various modes of public transportation in the Dukuh Atas area. The transport hub is expected to be operational in 2023. 

Many TOD are now being constructed in Greater Jakarta metro area such as Citra Sentul Raya and Dukuh Atas TOD. TOD are also being constructed in cities like Surabaya, Medan, and Palembang.

====Thailand====
There has been a proposal to develop Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) around mass transit stations in Bangkok, as well as around high-speed rail stations in cities such as Ayutthaya, Khon Kaen, Makkasan, Pattaya, and Si Racha. In addition, there have been proposals for TOD around main regional railway stations. The TOD proposal aims to create walkable, mixed-use communities centered around transit stations, taking advantage of their convenient transportation access. This development is expected to bring a range of benefits, including increased economic activity, reduced traffic congestion, and improved quality of life for residents.

==== Australia ====

===== Melbourne, Victoria =====
Melbourne, Victoria is expected to reach a population of 5 million by 2030 with the overwhelming majority of its residents relying on private automobiles. Since the turn of the century, sporadic efforts have been made by various levels of government to implement transit-oriented development principles. However, a lack of commitment to funding public transport infrastructure, resulting to overcrowding and amending zoning laws has dramatically slowed progress toward sustainable development for the city.

===== Milton, Queensland =====
Milton, an inner suburb of Brisbane, has been identified as Queensland&#x27;s first transit-oriented development under the Queensland Government&#x27;s South East Queensland Regional Plan. Milton railway station will undergo a multimillion-dollar revamp as part of the development of The Milton Residences to promote and encourage residents to embrace rail travel. This will include a new ticketing office, new public amenities, increased visibility across platforms and new and improved access points off Milton Road and Railway Terrace.

===== Sydney, New South Wales =====
The New South Wales state government has actively encouraged developments around stations on the Sydney Trains and Sydney Metro networks through its Priority Precincts plan. Several stations such as Chatswood, Burwood, Parramatta and Rhodes have large scale apartment developments built within close proximity during the 2010s. New apartment and office tower developments along the future Sydney Metro stations are being planned as integrated developments with the stations themselves. Examples of this include Victoria Cross Station and Crows Nest Station whilst existing stations such as Castle Hill and Epping have also had intensified development.

===== Newcastle, New South Wales =====

Honeysuckle is an urban renewal developed on 50 hectares of former industrial land in Newcastle, NSW. This project, carried out by the Honeysuckle Development Corporation, has at its core the emerge of mixed residential and commercial areas commutable to the Newcastle Light Rail and other alternative transport methods.

===Europe===

The term transit-oriented development, as a US-born concept, is rarely used in Europe, although many of the measures advocated in US transit-oriented development are also stressed in Europe. Many European cities have long been built around transit systems and there has thus often been little or no need to differentiate this type of development with a special term as has been the case in the US. An example of this is Copenhagen&#x27;s Finger Plan from 1947, which embodied many transit-oriented development aspects and is still used as an overall planning framework today. Recently, scholars and technicians have taken interest in the concept, however.
====Dublin, Ireland====

The area around Connolly station, in Dublin&#x27;s City Centre is a candidate for much needed mixed use development. Additionally, sketches for the area around Heuston railway station as-well as regional city stations in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford have been drawn up in Iarnród Eireann&#x27;s strategy 2027. which also includes plans for the expansion of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit through the DART+ programme. 

Galway, Ireland 

Galway County Council have created an Urban Framework Plan for the townlands of Garraun North and South, located west of Oranmore, home to Oranmore railway station and is less than 10km (6.2 miles) from Galway city centre. The plan describes Garraun as a &quot;Flagship development for County Galway, setting new standards in sustainable contemporary living, and with excellent access to public transport.&quot; 

The plan includes an expansion of the station&#x27;s car park to two stories and green space above, which will roll down into a public park. The plan describes three-storey mixed use buildings on the main road and lots of residential space. South of the railway station, an &quot;EcoPark&quot; is planned. 

====Paris, France====

Whereas the city of Paris has a centuries-long history, its main frame dates to the 19th century. The subway network was made to solve both linkage between the five main train stations and local transportation assets for citizens. The whole area of Paris City has metro stations no more than 500 metres apart. Recent bicycle and car rental systems (Velib and Autolib) also ease travel, in the very same way that TOD emphasizes. So do the new trams linking suburbs close to Paris proper, and tramline 3 around the edge of the city of Paris.

The La Défense area is an example of a large scale transit-oriented district.

====Stedenbaan, Netherlands====
In the southern part of the Randstad a neighborhood according to the principles of TOD will be built.

===Iran===
In Isfahan the subway is used for a TOD program.

== Impacts ==

=== Environmental ===
TOD has been shown to reduce multiple types of emissions in Los Angeles during life-cycle assessments; greenhouse gasses, respiratory irritants, and smog forming emissions can be reduced by approximately 30% in TOD when compared to lower density areas. This is attributed to various factors including residents having more travel options, reduced travel distances for everyday activities, and higher density housing reducing energy use per residence. In Dhaka TOD can also aid in reducing travel related emissions on a community level, specifically for work and school trips, due to residents traveling less distance to these locations. And it is suggested that the improvements in public transportation, pedestrian, and bicycle infrastructure that are associated with TOD and related policies may improve these reductions within Dhaka and other developing cities. However, TOD has also been found to be a major contributor to the urban heat island effect in Brisbane both having higher temperature and more rapidly increasing temperatures than non-TOD areas. This difference has been linked to TOD having a larger portion of non-porous land and less natural spaces, which must be considered when planning TOD.

=== Economic ===
TOD, specifically along light rail transit lines, have been seen to increase the amount of new businesses in Phoenix within one mile of a station, with businesses in the knowledge, service, and retail industries experiencing 88%, 40%, and 24% more new starts respectively than non-TOD areas. However, a decrease in manufacturing facilities has also been noted in TOD; similar results are likely to be seen in other U.S. cities. The value of condominiums in San Diego generally increases with decreasing distance from light rail transit stations, increasing walkability of neighborhoods, and increasing available services. This points to TOD as a preferable style of neighborhood to people, showing that market-driven creation of TOD neighborhoods may be possible in U.S. metropolitan areas. Resident expenses in TOD have been shown to be lower in well developed areas in spite of the generally higher rental costs due to lower energy use and travel costs, in Los Angeles the savings are around $3100 per year for one household.

=== Social ===
The studies on social impacts of TOD can be classified into three aspects. Behavioral impacts, psychological impacts and social impacts related to TOD induced gentrification and social inequality The social impact of TOD is categorized into three aspects:

* Behavioral impacts that are related to the effect on car use and travel behavior. First, since lowering car dependency and car ownership is one of the major goals of TOD, the existing studies consistently showed that TOD was negatively associated with car ownership. Other studies focus on the influence of TOD on residents’ travel behaviors. Though it seems self-evident that residents living in TOD areas are easier and thus more likely to travel by public transport, the existence of residential differences and the TOD-reduced gentrification make the linkages between TOD and public travel trips complex.
* Psychological impacts related to the subjective well-being and other sentiments. Studies on the psychological impacts of TOD mainly focus on subjective well-being, especially satisfaction with the travel domain and the life in general. First, a series of studies have examined the effects of TOD on travel satisfaction. While traveling by public transit is usually less pleasant compared with driving or active travel, TOD as a well-defined transit area is likely to generate more comfortable traveling experiences. Likewise, residents living within the TOD area tended to be more satisfied with public commuting. Nonetheless, since travel is an important life domain, satisfaction with public transport system is expected to significantly contribute to overall wellbeing.
* Impacts related to social inequality and TOD-induced gentrification. TOD is usually associated with regeneration of the old urban land use and increasing housing values, it may crowd out the low-income groups and cause large-scale residential mobility, significant neighborhood change and considerable upgrading of the TOD areas. Accordingly, TOD-induced gentrification is an emerging topic in transportation research in the recent decade.

== Reception ==
One criticism of transit-oriented development is that it has the potential to spur gentrification in low-income areas. In some cases, TOD can raise the housing costs of formerly affordable neighborhoods, pushing low- and moderate-income residents farther away from jobs and transit. When this happens, TOD projects can disrupt low-income neighborhoods. This can be very concerning due to the fact that lower income people tend to use (and need) transit more than higher income people.

When executed with equity in mind, however, TOD has the potential to benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities: it can link workers to employment centers, create construction and maintenance jobs, and has the potential to encourage investment in areas that have suffered neglect and economic depression. Moreover, it is well recognized that neighborhood development restrictions, while potentially in the immediate neighborhood&#x27;s best interest, contribute to regional undersupply of housing and drive up the cost of housing in general across a region. TOD reduces the overall cost of housing in a region by contributing to the housing supply, and therefore generally improves equity in the housing market. TOD also reduces transportation costs, which can have a greater impact on LMI households since they spend a larger share of their income on transportation relative to higher-income households. This frees up household income that can be used on food, education, or other necessary expenses. Low-income people are also less likely to own personal vehicles and therefore more likely to depend exclusively on public transportation to get to and from work, making reliable access to transit a necessity for their economic success.

==History==

TOD began in 1993 with the publication of Peter Calthorpe&#x27;s book &quot;The Next American Metropolis&quot;. Calthorpe and his colleagues based their theory on the ideals of the Garden city movement.

A transit city is a type of city designed around the use of public transport. In such cities, urban development is centered around rail stations or tramlines.

The transit city emerged in the industrial world around 1850, due to the advent of new transport technologies - the steam train and electric tram. This facilitated faster travel, leading to larger cities, although most locations still remained within walking or bicycle distance. During the period from 1850 to 1940, it was the dominant type of city in industrialized countries. In less-developed parts of the world, however, mass transit technology was not adopted as greatly, with many cities remaining walking cities up until the 1970s onwards, when they transformed directly into automotive cities.

<text>John Alexander Ogonowski (, February 24, 1951 – September 11, 2001) was a Polish-American aircraft pilot and an agricultural activist. A resident of Dracut, Massachusetts, Ogonowski was a leading advocate on behalf of farming in Massachusetts, particularly in aiding immigrant farmers from Cambodia, whom he assisted as part of the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project. He was the Captain of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists and flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks. He is believed to have been killed by the hijackers prior to the crash.

==Biography==
John Alexander Ogonowski was born February 24, 1951, in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he was raised. He attended St. Stanislaus School, Keith Academy in Lowell. He attended Lowell Technological Institute (now the University of Massachusetts Lowell), where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. He graduated in 1972 with a bachelor of science degree in Nuclear Engineering.

Ogonowski was a pilot in the U. S. Air Force during the Vietnam War, assigned to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, ferrying equipment to Asia and sometimes transporting the bodies of fallen American soldiers in C-141 transport aircraft. Following his service commitment, he resigned his commission under honorable conditions and separated from the military with the rank of captain.

Ogonowski became a commercial pilot in 1978. For 23 years, he flew airplanes for American Airlines, and was a member of the Allied Pilot Association. Ogonowski had joined the airline as a flight engineer after previously serving that role in the Air Force.

During the course of his commercial piloting career, he met Margaret, a flight attendant who went by the nickname &quot;Peggy&quot;, whom he later married.

Ogonowski was also an avid farmer, who secured 150 acres of farmland on Marsh Hill Road in Dracut through the federal Agriculture Preservation Restriction program. He raised hay, corn, pumpkins, blueberries, and peaches. He was a leading advocate for farming in Massachusetts, particularly in aiding immigrant farmers from Cambodia.

===September 11 attacks===
Ogonowski was killed on September 11, 2001, while at the controls as captain during the hijacking of American Airlines Flight 11. Following his murder, ringleader Mohamed Atta took his seat to control the Boeing 767, and crashed it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

==Legacy==
Ogonowski was survived by his wife Margaret and daughters Laura, Caroline, and Mary Catherine. His younger brother, Jim Ogonowski, who is also an agricultural activist, made an unsuccessful run for the United States House of Representatives in 2007.

In 2002, Ogonowski and Flight 11 flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney were the inaugural recipients of the Madeline Amy Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery, an honor that the Government of Massachusetts instituted to award annually at least one Massachusetts resident for displaying extraordinary courage in defending or saving the lives of others.

A remote controlled model aircraft flying field in nearby Tewksbury, Massachusetts, was dedicated to Ogonowski.

The University of Massachusetts Lowell, presented Ogonowski with a posthumous honorary doctorate at its 2003 commencement ceremony at Tsongas Arena.

The USAID Farmer to Farmer program was renamed the &quot;John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter FTF Program&quot; as part of the 2008 Farm Bill.

At the National 9/11 Memorial, Ogonowski is memorialized at the North Pool, on Panel N-74, adjacent to the name of Kathleen A. Nicosia, a friend and flight attendant also killed on board American Airlines Flight 11 that day.

<doc id="1118730" wikidata="Q132268" url="?curid=1118730" title="Enantiornithes">
<text>The Enantiornithes, also known as enantiornithines or enantiornitheans in literature, are a group of extinct avialans (&quot;birds&quot; in the broad sense), the most abundant and diverse group known from the Mesozoic era. Almost all retained teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds externally. Over seventy species of Enantiornithes have been named, but some names represent only single bones, so it is likely that not all are valid. The Enantiornithes became extinct at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, along with Hesperornithes and all other non-avian dinosaurs.

== Discovery and naming ==
The first Enantiornithes to be discovered were incorrectly referred to modern bird groups. For example, the first known species of Enantiornithes, &quot;Gobipteryx minuta&quot;, was originally considered a paleognath related to ostriches and tinamou. The Enantiornithes were first recognized as a distinct lineage, or &quot;subclass&quot; of birds, by Cyril A. Walker in 1981. Walker made this discovery based on some partial remains from the late Cretaceous period of what is now Argentina, which he assigned to a new genus, &quot;Enantiornis&quot;, giving the entire group its name. Since the 1990s, many more complete specimens of Enantiornithes have been discovered, and it was determined that a few previously described &quot;birds&quot; (e.g. &quot;Iberomesornis&quot;, &quot;Cathayornis&quot;, and &quot;Sinornis&quot;) were also Enantiornithes.

The name &quot;Enantiornithes&quot; means &quot;opposite birds&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;enantios&quot; () &quot;opposite&quot; + &quot;ornithes&quot; () &quot;birds&quot; . The name was coined by Cyril Alexander Walker in his landmark paper which established the group. In his paper, Walker explained what he meant by &quot;opposite&quot;:

This refers to an anatomical feature – the articulation of the shoulder bones – which has a concave-convex socket joint between the &quot;scapula&quot; (shoulder blade) and &quot;coracoid&quot; (the primary bone of the shoulder girdle in vertebrates other than mammals) that is the reverse of that of modern birds. Specifically, in the Enantiornithes, the scapula is and dish-shaped at this joint, and the coracoid is convex. In modern birds, the coracoscapular joint has a concave coracoid and convex scapula.

Walker was not clear on his reasons for giving this name in the etymology section of his paper, and this ambiguity led to some confusion among later researchers. For example, Alan Feduccia stated in 1996:
Feduccia&#x27;s point about the &quot;tarsometatarsus&quot; (the combined upper foot and ankle bone) is correct, but Walker did not use this reasoning in his original paper. Walker never described the fusion of the tarsometatarsus as opposite, but rather as &quot;Only partial&quot;. Also, it is not certain that Enantiornithes had triosseal canals, since no fossil preserves this feature.

As a group, the Enantiornithes are often referred to as &quot;enantiornithines&quot; in literature. However, several scientists have noted that this is incorrect, because following the standard rules for forming the names of animal groups, it implies reference only to the subfamily Enantiornithinae. Following the naming conventions used for modern birds as well as extinct groups, it has been pointed out that the correct term is &quot;enantiornithean&quot;.

==Origin and range==
&quot;Praeornis&quot;, from the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian of Kazakhstan, may have been the earliest known member of Enantiornithes according to Agnolin et al. (2017).

Birds with confidently identified characteristics of Enantiornithes found in Albian of Australia, Maastrichtian of South America, and Campanian of Mexico (&quot;Alexornis&quot;), Mongolia and western edge of prehistoric Asia suggest a worldwide distribution of this group or in the relatively warm regions, at least. Enantiornithes have been found on every continent except Antarctica. Fossils attributable to this group are exclusively Cretaceous in age, and it is believed that the Enantiornithes became extinct at the same time as their non-avialan dinosaur relatives. The earliest known Enantiornithes are from the Early Cretaceous of Spain (e.g. &quot;Noguerornis&quot;) and China (e.g. &quot;Protopteryx&quot;) and the latest from the Late Cretaceous of North and South America (e.g. &quot;Avisaurus&quot; and &quot;Enantiornis&quot;). The widespread occurrence of this group suggests that at least some Enantiornithes were able to cross oceans under their own power; they are the first known avialan lineage with a global distribution.

==Description==

Many fossils of Enantiornithes are very fragmentary, and some species are only known from a piece of a single bone. Almost all specimens that are complete, in full articulation, and with soft tissue preservation are known from Las Hoyas in Cuenca, Spain and the Jehol group in Liaoning (China). Extraordinary remains of Enantiornithes have also been preserved in Burmese amber deposits dated to 99 million years ago and include hatchlings described in 2017 and 2018, as well as isolated body parts such as wings and feet. These amber remains are among the most well-preserved of any mesozoic dinosaur. Fossils of this clade have been found in both inland and marine sediments, suggesting that they were an ecologically diverse group.

Enantiornithes appear to have included waders, swimmers, granivores, insectivores, fishers, and raptors. The vast majority of Enantiornithes were small, between the size of a sparrow and a starling, however display considerable variation in size with some species. The largest species in this clade include &quot;Pengornis houi&quot;, &quot;Xiangornis shenmi&quot;, &quot;Zhouornis hani&quot;, and &quot;Mirarce eatoni&quot;,&quot;&quot; (with the latter species being described as similar in size to modern turkeys,) although at least a few larger species may have also existed, including a potentially crane-sized species known only from footprints in the Eumeralla Formation (and possibly also represented in the Wonthaggi Formation by a single furcula). Among the smallest described specimens are unnamed hatchlings, although the holotype specimens of &quot;Parvavis chuxiongensis&quot; and &quot;Cratoavis cearensis&quot; are comparable in size to small tits or hummingbirds.

===Skull===

Given their wide range of habitats and diets, the cranial morphology of Enantiornithes varied considerably between species. Skulls of Enantiornithes combined a unique suite of primitive and advanced features. As in more primitive avialans like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, they retained several separate cranial bones, small premaxillae (bones of the snout tip) and most species had toothy jaws rather than toothless beaks. Only a few species, such as &quot;Gobipteryx minuta&quot;, were fully toothless and had beaks. They also had simple quadrate bones, a complete bar separating each orbit (eye hole) from each antorbital fenestra, and dentaries (the main toothed bones of the lower jaw) without forked rear tips. A squamosal bone is preserved in an indeterminate juvenile specimen, while a postorbital is preserved in &quot;Shenqiornis&quot; and &quot;Pengornis&quot;. In modern birds these bones are assimilated into the cranium. Some Enantiornithes may have had their temporal fenestrae (holes in the side of the head) merged into the orbits as in modern birds due to the postorbitals either not being present or not being long enough to divide the openings. A quadratojugal bone, which in modern birds is fused to the jugal, is preserved in &quot;Pterygornis&quot;. The presence of these primitive features of the skull would have rendered the Enantiornithes capable of only limited cranial kinesis (the ability to move the jaw independent of the cranium).

===Wing===

As a very large group of birds, the Enantiornithes displayed a high diversity of different body plans based on differences in ecology and feeding, reflected in an equal diversity of wing forms, many paralleling adaptations to different lifestyles seen in modern birds. In general, the wings of Enantiornithes were advanced compared to more primitive avialans like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, and displayed some features related to flight similar to those found in the lineage leading to modern birds, the Ornithuromorpha. While most Enantiornithes had claws on at least some of their fingers, many species had shortened hands, a highly mobile shoulder joint, and proportional changes in the wing bones similar to modern birds. Like modern birds, Enantiornithes had alulas, or &quot;bastard wings&quot;, small forward-pointing arrangements of feathers on the first digit that granted higher maneuverability in the air and aided in precise landings.

Several wings with preserved feathers have been found in Burmese amber. These are the first complete Mesozoic dinosaur remains preserved this way (a few isolated feathers are otherwise known, unassigned to any species), and one of the most exquisitely preserved dinosaurian fossils known. The preserved wings show variations in feather pigment and prove that Enantiornithes had fully modern feathers, including barbs, barbules, and hooklets, and a modern arrangement of wing feather including long flight feathers, short coverts, a large alula and an undercoat of down.

One fossil of Enantiornithes shows wing-like feather tufts on its legs, similar to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. The leg feathers are also reminiscent of the four-winged dinosaur &quot;Microraptor&quot;, however differ by the feathers being shorter, more disorganized (they do not clearly form a wing) and only extend down to the ankle rather than along the foot.

===Tail===

Clarke &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) surveyed all fossils of Enantiornithes then known and concluded that none had preserved tail feathers that formed a lift-generating fan, as in modern birds. They found that all avialans outside of Euornithes (the clade they referred to as Ornithurae) with preserved tail feathers had only short coverts or elongated paired tail plumes. They suggested that the development of the pygostyle in Enantiornithes must have been a function of tail shortening, not the development of a modern tail feather anatomy. These scientists suggested that a fan of tail feathers and the associated musculature needed to control them, known as the &quot;rectrical bulb&quot;, evolved alongside a short, triangular pygostyle, like the ones in modern birds, rather than the long, rod- or dagger-shaped pygostyles in more primitive avialans like the Enantiornithes. Instead of a feather fan, most Enantiornithes had a pair of long specialized pinfeathers similar to those of the extinct &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; and certain extant birds-of-paradise.

However, further discoveries showed that at least among basal Enantiornithes, tail anatomy was more complex than previously thought. One genus, &quot;Shanweiniao&quot;, was initially interpreted as having at least four long tail feathers that overlapped each other and might have formed a lift-generating surface similar to the tail fans of Euronithes, though a later study indicates that &quot;Shanweiniao&quot; was more likely to have rachis-dominated tail feathers similar to feathers present in &quot;Paraprotopteryx&quot;. &quot;Chiappeavis&quot;, a primitive pengornithid, had a fan of tail feathers similar to that of more primitive avialans like &quot;Sapeornis&quot;, suggesting that this might have been the ancestral condition, with pinfeathers being a feature evolved several times in early avialans for display purposes. Another species of Enantiornithes, &quot;Feitianius&quot;, also had an elaborate fan of tail feathers. More importantly, soft tissue preserved around the tail was interpreted as the remains of a rectrical bulb, suggesting that this feature was not in fact restricted to species with modern-looking pygostyles, but might have evolved much earlier than previously thought and been present in many Enantiornithes. At least one genus of Enantiornithes, &quot;Cruralispennia&quot;, had a modern-looking pygostyle but lacked a tail fan.

==Biology==

===Diet===

Given the wide diversity of skull shape among Enantiornithes, many different dietary specializations must have been present among the group. Some, like &quot;Shenqiornis&quot;, had large, robust jaws suitable for eating hard-shelled invertebrates. The short, blunt teeth of &quot;Pengornis&quot; were likely used to feed on soft-bodied arthropods. The strongly hooked talons of Bohaiornithidae suggest that they were predators of small to medium-sized vertebrates, but their robust teeth instead suggest a diet of hard-shelled animals.

A few specimens preserve actual stomach contents. Unfortunately, none of these preserve the skull, so direct correlation between their known diet and snout/tooth shape cannot be made. &quot;Eoalulavis&quot; was found to have the remains of exoskeletons from aquatic crustaceans preserved in its digestive tract, and &quot;Enantiophoenix&quot; preserved corpuscles of amber among the fossilized bones, suggesting that this animal fed on tree sap, much like modern sapsuckers and other birds. The sap would have fossilized and become amber. However, more recently it has been suggested that the sap moved post-mortem, hence not representing true stomachal contents. Combined with the putative fish pellets of &quot;Piscivorenantiornis&quot; turning out to be fish excrement, the strange stomachal contents of some species turning out to be ovaries and the supposed gastroliths of &quot;Bohaiornis&quot; being random mineral precipitates, only the &quot;Eoalulavis&quot; displays actual stomach contents.

A study on paravian digestive systems indicates that known Enantiornithes lacked a crop and a gizzard, didn&#x27;t use gastroliths and didn&#x27;t eject pellets. This is considered at odds with the high diversity of diets that their different teeth and skull shapes imply, though some modern birds have lost the gizzard and rely solely on strong stomachal acids. An example was discovered with what was suspected to be gastroliths in the what would have been the fossil&#x27;s stomach, re-opening the discussion of the use of gastroliths by Enantiornithes. X-ray and scanning microscope inspection of the rocks determined that they were actually chalcedony crystals, and not gastroliths.

Longipterygidae is the most extensively studied family in terms of diet due to their rather unusual rostral anatomy, with long jaws and few teeth arranged at the jaw ends. They have variously been interpreted as piscivores, probers akin to shorebirds and as arboreal bark-probers. A 2022 study however does find them most likely to be generalistic insectivores (sans possibly &quot;Shengjingornis&quot; due to its larger size, poorly preserved skull and unusual pedal anatomy), being too small for specialised carnivory and herbivory; the atypical rostrum is tentatively speculated to be unrelated to feeding ecology. However a posterior study has found them to be herbivorous, including the presence of gymnosperm seeds in their digestive system.

Avisaurids occupied a niche analogous to modern birds of prey, having the ability to lift small prey with their feet in a manner similar to hawks or owls.

===Predation===
A fossil from Spain reported by Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; in 2001 included the remains of four hatchling skeletons of three different species of Enantiornithes. They are substantially complete, very tightly associated, and show surface pitting of the bones that indicates partial digestion. The authors concluded that this association was a regurgitated pellet and, from the details of the digestion and the size, that the hatchlings were swallowed whole by a pterosaur or small theropod dinosaur. This was the first evidence that Mesozoic avialans were prey animals, and that some Mesozoic pan-avians regurgitated pellets like owls do today.

===Life history===

Known fossils of Enantiornithes include eggs, embryos, and hatchlings. An embryo, still curled in its egg, has been reported from the Yixian Formation. Juvenile specimens can be identified by a combination of factors: rough texture of their bone tips indicating portions which were still made of cartilage at the time of death, relatively small breastbones, large skulls and eyes, and bones which had not yet fused to one another. Some hatchling specimens have been given formal names, including &quot;Liaoxiornis delicatus&quot;; however, Luis Chiappe and colleagues considered the practice of naming new species based on juveniles detrimental to the study of Enantiornithes, because it is nearly impossible to determine which adult species a given juvenile specimen belongs to, making any species with a hatchling holotype a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

Together with hatchling specimens of the Mongolian &quot;Gobipteryx&quot; and &quot;Gobipipus&quot;, these finds demonstrate that hatchling Enantiornithes had the skeletal ossification, well-developed wing feathers, and large brain which correlate with precocial or superprecocial patterns of development in birds of today. In other words, Enantiornithes probably hatched from the egg already well developed and ready to run, forage, and possibly even fly at just a few days old.

Findings suggests Enantiornithes, especially the toothed species, had a longer incubation time than modern birds.

Analyses of Enantiornithes bone histology have been conducted to determine the growth rates of these animals. A 2006 study of &quot;Concornis&quot; bones showed a growth pattern different from modern birds; although growth was rapid for a few weeks after hatching, probably until fledging, this small species did not reach adult size for a long time, probably several years. Other studies have all supported the view that growth to adult size was slow, as it is in living precocial birds (as opposed to altricial birds, which are known to reach adult size quickly). Studies of the rate of bone growth in a variety of Enantiornithes has shown that smaller species tended to grow faster than larger ones, the opposite of the pattern seen in more primitive species like &quot;Jeholornis&quot; and in non-avialan dinosaurs. Some analyses have interpreted the bone histology to indicate that Enantiornithes may not have had fully avian endothermy, instead having an intermediate metabolic rate. However a 2021 study rejects the idea that they had less endothermic metabolisms than modern birds.

Evidence of colonial nesting has been found in Enantiornithes, in sediments from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Romania. Evidence from nesting sites shows that Enantiornithes buried their eggs like modern megapodes, which is consistent with their inferred superprecocial adaptations.

A 2020 study on a juvenile&#x27;s feathers further stresses the ontological similarities to modern megapodes, but cautions several differences such as the arboreal nature of most Enantiornithes as opposed to the terrestrial lifestyle of megapodes.

It has been speculated that superprecociality in Enantiornithes might have prevented them from developing specialised toe arrangements seen in modern birds like zygodactyly.

Although the vast majority of histology studies and known remains of Enantiornithes point to superprecociality being the norm, one specimen, MPCM-LH-26189, seems to represent an altricial juvenile, implying that like modern birds Enantiornithes explored multiple reproductive strategies.

===Flight===
Because many Enantiornithes lacked complex tails and possessed radically different wing anatomy compared to modern birds, they have been the subject of several studies testing their flight capabilities.

Traditionally, they have been considered inferior flyers, due to the shoulder girdle anatomy being assumed to be more primitive and unable to support a ground-based launching mechanism, as well as due to the absence of rectrices in many species.

However, several studies have shown that they were efficient flyers, like modern birds, possessing a similarly complex nervous system and wing feather ligaments. Additionally, the lack of a complex tail appears to not have been very relevant for avian flight as a whole - some extinct birds like lithornids also lacked complex tail feathers but were good flyers, and they appear to have been capable of a ground based launching.

Enantiornithes resemble Ornithuromorphs in many anatomical features of the flight apparatus, but a sternal keel is absent in the basal-most members, only a single basal taxon appears to have had a triosseal canal, and their robust pygostyle seems unable to support the muscles that control the modern tail feathers involved in flight. Though some basal Enantiornithes exhibit ancestral flight apparatuses, by the end of the Mesozoic many Enantiornithes had several features convergent with the Neornithes including a deeply keeled sternum, a narrow furcula with a short hypocleidium, and ulnar quill knobs that indicate increased aerial abilities.

At least &quot;Elsornis&quot; appears to have become secondarily flightless.

==Classification==
Some researchers classify Enantiornithes, along with the true birds, in the class Aves. Others use the more restrictive crown group definition of Aves (which only includes neornithes, anatomically modern birds), and place Enantiornithes in the more inclusive group Avialae. Enantiornithes were more advanced than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, and &quot;Sapeornis&quot;, but in several respects they were more primitive than modern birds, perhaps following an intermediate evolutionary path.

A consensus of scientific analyses indicates that Enantiornithes is one of two major groups within the larger group Ornithothoraces. The other ornithothoracine group is Euornithes or Ornithuromorpha, which includes all living birds as a subset. This means that Enantiornithes were a successful branch of avialan evolution, but one that diversified entirely separately from the lineage leading to modern birds. One study has however found that the shared sternal anatomy was acquired independently and such a relationship needs to be reexamined.

Enantiornithes classification and taxonomy has historically been complicated by a number of factors. In 2010, paleontologists Jingmai O&#x27;Connor and Gareth Dyke outlined a number of criticisms against the prevailing practices of scientists failing to describe many specimens in enough detail for others to evaluate thoroughly. Some species have been described based on specimens which are held in private collections, making further study or review of previous findings impossible. Because it is often unfeasible for other scientists to study each specimen in person given the worldwide distribution of the Enantiornithes, and due to the many uninformative descriptions which have been published on possibly important specimens, many of these specimens become &quot;functional &quot;nomina dubia&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, many species have been named based on extremely fragmentary specimens, which would not be very informative scientifically even if they were described sufficiently. Over one-third of all named species are based on only a fragment of a single bone. O&#x27;Connor and Dyke argued that while these specimens can help expand knowledge of the time span or geographic range of the Enantiornithes and it is important to describe them, naming such specimens is &quot;unjustifiable&quot;.

===Relationships===
Enantiornithes is the sister group to Euornithes, and together they form a clade called Ornithothoraces (though see above). Most phylogenetic studies have recovered Enantiornithes as a monophyletic group distinct from the modern birds and their closest relatives. The 2002 phylogenetic analysis by Clarke and Norell, though, reduced the number of Enantiornithes autapomorphies to just four.

Enantiornithes systematics are highly provisional and notoriously difficult to study, due to their small size and the fact that Enantiornithes tend to be extremely homoplastic, or very similar to each other in most of their skeletal features due to convergent evolution rather than common ancestry. What appears fairly certain by now is that there were subdivisions within Enantiornithes possibly including some minor basal lineages in addition to the more advanced Euenantiornithes. The details of the interrelationship of all these lineages, indeed the validity of most, is disputed, although the Avisauridae, for one example, seem likely to constitute a valid group. Phylogenetic taxonomists have hitherto been very reluctant to suggest delimitations of clades of Enantiornithes.

One such delineation named the Euenantiornithes, was defined by Chiappe (2002) as comprising all species closer to &quot;Sinornis&quot; than to &quot;Iberomesornis&quot;. Because &quot;Iberomesornis&quot; is often found to be the most primitive or basal member of the Enantiornithes, Euenantiornithes may be an extremely inclusive group, made up of all Enantiornithes except for &quot;Iberomesornis&quot; itself. Despite being in accordance with phylogenetic nomenclature, this definition of Euenantiornithes was severely criticized by some researchers, such as Paul Sereno, who called it &quot;a ill-defined clade [...] a good example of a poor choice in a phylogenetic definition&quot;.

The cladogram below was found by an analysis by Wang &quot;et al.&quot; in 2015, updated from a previous data set created by Jingmai O&#x27;Connor.
The cladogram below is from Wang &quot;et al.&quot;, 2022, and includes most named taxa and recovers several previously-named clades. Letters on branches indicate the positions of &quot;wildcard&quot; taxa, those which have been recovered in multiple disparate positions.

== List of genera ==

=== Incertae sedis ===
Enantiornithes taxonomy is difficult to evaluate, and as a result few clades within the group are consistently found by phylogenetic analyses. Most Enantiornithes are not included in any specific family, and as such are listed here. Many of these have been considered Euenantiornithes, although the controversy behind this name means that it is not used consistently in studies of Enantiornithes.

===Longipterygidae===
The Longipterygidae was a family of long-snouted early Cretaceous Enantiornithes, with teeth only at the tips of the snout. They are generally considered to be fairly basal members of the group.
===Pengornithidae===
The Pengornithidae was a family of large early Enantiornithes. They had numerous small teeth and numerous primitive features which are lost in most other Enantiornithes. Mostly known from the early Cretaceous of China, with putative Late Cretaceous taxa from Madagascar.
===Bohaiornithidae===
Bohaiornithids were large but geologically short-lived early Enantiornithes, with long, hooked talons and robust teeth with curved tips. They may have been equivalent to birds of prey, although this interpretation is open to much debate. The monophyly of this group is doubtful, and it may actually be an evolutionary grade.
===Gobipterygidae===
Some members of the group are obscure or poorly described and may be synonymous with its type species, &quot;Gobipteryx minuta&quot;.
===Avisauridae===
Avisauridae is subjected to two differing definitions of varying inclusiveness. The more inclusive definition, which follows Cau &amp; Arduini (2008), is used here. Avisaurids were a long-lasting and widespread family of Enantiornithes, which are mainly distinguished by specific features of their tarsometatarsals (ankle bones). The largest and most advanced members of the group survived in North and South America up until the end of the Cretaceous, yet are very fragmentary compared to some earlier taxa.
===Dubious genera and notable unnamed specimens===
*&quot;Gobipipus reshetovi&quot;: Described in 2013 from embryo specimens within eggshells from the Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia. These specimens were very similar to embryonic &quot;Gobipteryx&quot; specimens, although the describers of &quot;Gobipipus&quot; (a set of controversial paleontologists including Evgeny Kurochkin and Sankar Chatterjee) consider it distinct.
*&quot;Hebeiornis fengningensis&quot;: A synonym of &quot;Vescornis&quot; due to having been described from the same specimen. Despite having been described in 1999, 5 years prior to the description of &quot;Vescornis&quot;, the description was so poor compared to the description of &quot;Vescornis&quot; that the latter name is considered to take priority by most authors. As a result, the name &quot;Hebeiornis&quot; is considered a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; (&quot;naked name&quot;).
* &quot;Proornis&quot; is an informally-named bird from North Korea. It may not be a member of Enantiornithes.
* &quot;Liaoxiornis delicatus&quot;: Described in 1999 from a specimen of Enantiornithes found in the Yixian Formation. This specimen was originally considered to be a tiny adult, but later found to be a hatchling. Other specimens have henceforth been assigned to the genus. Due to a lack of distinguishing feature, many paleontologists have considered this genus an undiagnostic &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.
* &quot;Wasaibpanchi&quot;: A supposed member of Enantiornithes from Pakistan; the describing paper is of dubious status.
*LP-4450: A juvenile of an indeterminate specimen of Enantiornithes from the El Montsec Formation of Spain. Its 2006 description studied the histology of the skeleton, while later studies reported a squamosal bone present in the specimen but unknown in other Enantiornithes.
*IVPP V 13939: Briefly described in 2004, this Yixian Enantiornithes specimen had advanced pennaceous feathers on its legs, similar to (albeit shorter than) those of other paravians such as &quot;Microraptor&quot; and &quot;Anchiornis&quot;.
*DIP-V-15100 and DIP-V-15101: Two different wings from hatchling specimens which were described in 2015. They attracted a significant amount of media attention upon their description. They were preserved in exceptional details due to having been trapped within Burmese amber for approximately 99 million years.
*HPG-15-1: A partial corpse of an Enantiornithes hatchling also preserved in Burmese amber. Although indeterminate, it attracted even more media attention than the two wings upon its description in 2017.
*CUGB P1202: An indeterminate juvenile bohaiornithid from the Jiufotang Formation. A 2016 analysis of its feathering found elongated putative melanosomes, suggesting that a large portion of its feathering was iridescent.
*DIP-V-15102: Another corpse of an indeterminate hatchling preserved in Burmese amber. Described in early 2018.
*MPCM-LH-26189 a/b: A partial skeleton of a hatchling from Las Hoyas in Spain, including both slab and counter-slab components. Its 2018 description revealed how various features developed in Enantiornithes as they aged. Such features include the ossification of the sternum from various smaller bones, and the fusion of tail vertebrae into a pygostyle.

<doc id="1118731" wikidata="Q1535891" url="?curid=1118731" title="Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser">
<text>The Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser is an automobile that was manufactured and marketed by Oldsmobile from 1971 until 1992. Marking the return of Oldsmobile to the full-size station wagon segment, the Custom Cruiser was initially slotted above the intermediate Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, ultimately above the later mid-size Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser.

For three generations, the Custom Cruiser shared the General Motors B platform with the Buick Estate, Pontiac Safari, and the Chevrolet Caprice (initially Chevrolet Kingswood) station wagons. Within Oldsmobile, the Custom Cruiser shared its trim with the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight. During 1985 and 1986, all three GM mid-price divisions downsized their B-platform full-size sedans, leaving the Custom Cruiser with no sedan counterpart. After the discontinuation of the Cutlass Supreme Classic, the model line became the sole Oldsmobile sold with rear-wheel drive.

Following the 1992 model year, production of the Custom Cruiser was discontinued. Alongside an extensive redesign for 1991, Oldsmobile had already initiated station wagon alternatives, introducing both the Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan (1990) and Oldsmobile Bravada mid-size SUV (1991). In total, Oldsmobile produced 451,819 Custom Cruisers over 21 years. Following the discontinuation of the model line, GM ended full-size station wagon production after 1996, becoming the final American-brand manufacturer to do so at the time.


==First use of name ==

The Custom Cruiser nameplate was introduced by Oldsmobile in 1940, as the division introduced formal names for its vehicles for the first time, introducing the flagship Custom Cruiser 90. For 1941, the model line was offered with both inline-6 and inline-8 engines, with Oldsmobile renaming it as the Custom Cruiser 96 and Custom Cruiser 98.

For 1942, the Custom Cruiser 96 was dropped, leaving the 98 as the flagship Oldsmobile. Dropping the Custom Cruiser name after 1947, the 98 (later renamed Ninety-Eight) remained on the C-body chassis through its 1996 discontinuation.

Following the introduction of the Vista Cruiser and the return of the Custom Cruiser, Oldsmobile expanded the use of the &quot;Cruiser&quot; nameplate across many of its 1970s and 1980s station wagon lines, including the Cutlass (Supreme) Cruiser, Firenza Cruiser, and Cutlass Cruiser (Cutlass Ciera).

== First generation (1971–1976) ==
For the 1971 model year, full-size station wagons returned to the Oldsmobile product range (for the first time since 1964), coinciding with the redesign of GM full-size product range. In place of the previous Fiesta name used for Oldsmobile station wagons, the Custom Cruiser name was revived, slotting it above the A-body Vista Cruiser wagon. Sharing its body with the Buick Estate and Pontiac Safari (Grand Safari), the Custom Cruiser was slightly longer than Chevrolet Impala/Caprice station wagons.

Though designed without the distinctive glass roof panels of the Vista Cruiser, the Custom Cruiser and its counterparts shared its interior layout; the optional third-row seat was faced forward. Similar to the Chevrolet Suburban, the third-row seat was accessed by a split second-row bench seat that folded forward, expanding seating to eight passengers.

Following the fitment of 5 mph bumpers, the 1974–1976 Custom Cruiser grew to over 19 feet long, becoming one of the longest vehicles ever built by Oldsmobile.

=== Chassis ===
The Custom Cruiser (and its Buick and Pontiac counterparts) used the GM B-body chassis, extended to the 127-inch wheelbase used by the GM C-body platform (used by the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight and Buick Electra). In contrast to GM B/C/D-platform vehicles of the time, GM 1971–1976 full-size station wagons used a rear suspension of multi-leaf rear springs (in line with the C/K trucks of the time).

At shipping weight ( with woodgrain), or about curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Custom Cruiser wagons are the heaviest Oldsmobiles ever built. Along with similar versions of the Buick Estate, the model line also serves as the heaviest sedan-based GM vehicle ever produced. The Custom Cruiser used the longest wheelbase in its segment, besting all Chrysler wagons (124 inches), the AMC Ambassador (122 inches), and Ford/Mercury wagons (121 inches), shorter only than the 1973 redesign of the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban (129.5 inches).

====Powertrain====
Oldsmobile offered the 455 cubic-inch &quot;Rocket V8&quot; in various states of tune from 1971 until 1976 (the &quot;Rocket&quot; brand itself was discontinued in 1975). A 190 hp 400 cubic-inch &quot;Pontiac&quot; V8 was offered for 1975.

From 1971 to 1976, the model line was offered solely with the GM &quot;Turbo-Hydramatic 400&quot; 3-speed automatic transmission. 

=== Body ===
While sharing its roofline and doors with its divisional counterparts, the body of the Custom Cruiser was styled as a hybrid of the B-body Delta 88 and the C-body Ninety-Eight, using components from both model lines. From the Ninety-Eight, the Custom Cruiser shared its front fascia and rear quarter panels (and front fender skirts); the interior adopted trim elements from both the Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight.

In line with the Vista Cruiser, simulated woodgrain trim was offered as an option, with nearly 80% of buyers selecting the feature.

During its production, the Custom Cruiser followed the exterior design of Ninety-Eight, receiving a new front bumper for 1972; front and rear 5-mph bumpers were adding during 1973 and 1974, respectively. For 1974, the grille underwent a redesign.

For 1976, the Custom Cruiser received a second revision. Largely a preview of the 1977 Oldsmobile 98, the fascia was given four square headlights with outboard marker lights. 

==== Clamshell tailgate design ====
Along with all other 1971–1976 General Motors full-size station wagons built on the B-platform, first-generation Custom Cruiser wagons feature a &quot;clamshell&quot; tailgate design. A two-piece tailgate configuration, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the rear glass window retracted up into the roof; the design operated either manually or with optional power assist.

The first powered tailgate in automotive history, the powered option ultimately became standard, as the manual tailgate required a degree of effort to lift out of storage. The system was operated from either an instrument panel switch or by key on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell tailgate was intended to aid the loading of the 19-foot long station wagons in tight parking spaces. Heavy and complex, the system was not included in the 1977 redesign of the model line. Over one foot shorter and over 1,000 pounds lighter overall, the new body was designed with a two-way tailgate (a design first developed by Ford).

===Production Figures===
Note: 1971–1976 model years are the only production figures that Oldsmobile broke down specifically by body configuration (i.e., woodgrain, two-row or three-row seating)


== Second generation (1977–1990) ==
For the 1977 model year, the second-generation Custom Cruiser was released as part of the downsizing of the entire GM full-size range. In another revision, the Custom Cruiser became a direct counterpart of the Delta 88 sedan. Again the counterpart of the Buick Estate and Pontiac Safari, the Custom Cruiser now shared its body with Chevrolet station wagons.

Following the exit of Chrysler from the segment after 1977, the Custom Cruiser competed primarily against the Ford LTD Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park, which remained in production through 1991. After the 1985 model year, the Custom Cruiser became the largest Oldsmobile, as GM shifted Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac B-body sedans to the front-wheel drive H-platform, downsizing them again. Along with the Chevrolet Caprice remaining the sole B-body sedan/wagon, Oldsmobile and Buick station wagons became distinct model lines (the Pontiac Safari ended production after 1989).

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser (as with all full-size GM station wagons) is based on the GM B-platform. As part of the GM downsizing, station wagons were consolidated upon a common 115.9 inch wheelbase shared with wagons of all three mid-price divisions and Chevrolet (and all B-platform sedans). In the redesign, the Custom Cruiser shed 14 inches in length, 11 inches of wheelbase, and up to 900 pounds of curb weight (though becoming taller). Though sharing its wheelbase with the intermediate Vista Cruiser (and nearly 200 pounds lighter) prior to its 1978 replacement, the Custom Cruiser remained in the full-size segment, as its body was several inches wider and taller.

====Powertrain====

At its 1977 launch, the second-generation Custom Cruiser was offered with two engines, a 170 hp 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile V8, with a 185 hp 403 cubic-inch Oldsmobile V8 as an option. For 1979, both engines were detuned: the 350 was detuned to 160 hp and the 403 offered 175 hp. After 1980, both the 350 and the 403 were replaced by the 307.

For 1980, Oldsmobile introduced its third (and last) V8 engine for the B-platform, the 307. Initially producing 150 hp, the 307 was detuned to 140 hp for 1981. For 1985, new &quot;swirl port&quot; cylinder heads were given to the 307. While engine horsepower was not increased, the design increased torque and driveability; at the expense of high RPM power and performance, the heads featured relatively small intake ports. Along with the new cylinder heads, roller lifters replaced flat lifters.

For 1980 in California-market examples, Oldsmobile introduced a new E4ME electronic carburetor, using CCC (Computer Command Control); in 1981, the 4-barrel carburetor was adopted in all 50 states, replacing the previous mechanical M4ME version. In Canada, E4ME was not adopted until 1986.

1977–1990 Custom Cruisers were fitted with two different automatic transmissions. From 1977 until 1980, the 3-speed THM200 was the sole transmission. From 1981 through 1990, the THM200-4R 4-speed automatic with overdrive was added, as GM added a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the overdrive transmission, the Custom Cruiser drive with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range

In its final year of production, the second-generation Custom Cruiser marked the end of the Oldsmobile-produced V8 (formerly the &quot;Rocket V8&quot;). Shifting from its long-running practice of each division developing its own engines, during the 1980s, GM consolidated V8 production in non-Cadillac full-size cars towards Chevrolet and Oldsmobile, with the latter division developing diesel engines. Towards the end of the decade, GM phased out the Oldsmobile V8 family, as the 307 was the final engine produced by the company without fuel injection. After 1990, Oldsmobile would not have a division-produced engine; the only GM division-unique engine family developed since 1990 was the Cadillac Northstar (developed with some Oldsmobile and Pontiac applications).

===== Oldsmobile diesel V8 =====
For 1978, Oldsmobile introduced its first diesel engine, a naturally aspirated 120 hp 350 cubic-inch V8. For 1980, the V8 was retuned to 105 hp, remaining an option through 1985.

=== Body ===

In contrast to the 1971–1976 Custom Cruiser (a hybrid of the Delta 88 and the Ninety-Eight), Oldsmobile styled the 1977 Custom Cruiser as a station wagon version of the Delta 88, adopting its front fascia entirely. To distinguish itself from its nearly identical Buick, Chevrolet, and Pontiac counterparts, the Custom Cruiser was given its simulated wood design, with wood following the curve of the wheel wells.

Though interior space was reduced only marginally through the downsizing, the full-size Custom Cruiser and the intermediate Vista Cruiser/Cutlass Supreme wagon switched places as the longest Oldsmobile wagon; this lasted only for 1977, as GM intermediates underwent their own downsizing for 1978.

In a major departure from the 2-piece &quot;clamshell&quot; tailgate of its predecessor, the Custom Cruiser was fitted with a two-way tailgate; similar to configurations offered by Ford and Chrysler, the two-way tailgate opened to the side as a door or hinged down as a tailgate (with the rear window glass retracted). The third-row seat made its return, allowing for 8-passenger seating; to allow for production commonality on a single wheelbase, the Custom Cruiser was produced with a rear-facing third row seat (as were all full-size GM station wagons).

Alongside all B-platform station wagons and sedans, the Custom Cruiser saw an exterior update for 1980, with wagons receiving a new front fascia. To aid aerodynamics and fuel economy the grille and front fascia were redesigned, with the headlamps mounted closer to the front bumpers. Similar to the other B-body Oldsmobile&#x27;s, the Custom Cruiser gained wraparound front marker lights. In a minor change, the design of the simulated woodgrain adopted the common layout used by Buick and Chevrolet, joining the headlamps and taillamps.

From 1980 until 1990, the exterior and interior of the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser saw almost no visible change, besides a small front fascia swap in 1985. Instead of the split-grille style from 1980 to 1984, the Custom Cruiser was now fitted with a single, wider grille. Along with the wider grille came a sharper header panel, instead of curving off on the edge. In 1986, the rear tailgate saw the addition of a federally mandated third brake light. In 1989, the seat belts in the B-body lineup were modified to meet federal safety standards. The rear outboard seats were fitted with shoulder belts and as the platform was not designed for airbags, the front shoulder belts were shifted from the B-pillar to the front doors for 1990, allowing the seat belts to remain buckled at all times.

=== Production figures ===


== Third generation (1991–1992) ==
For 1991, General Motors redesigned its full-size B-body line for the first time since 1977. Though chassis underpinnings saw only minor updates, substantial updates were made to the body and interior. As part of the redesign, the Custom Cruiser received functional upgrades including anti-lock brakes and a driver-side airbag (replacing the door-mounted passive-restraint seatbelts).

The Custom Cruiser was joined by a redesigned Chevrolet Caprice wagon, with the Buick Estate renamed as the Buick Roadmaster (Pontiac retired the Safari after 1989). In contrast to Chevrolet and Buick, Oldsmobile was the only GM division to market the full-size B-body exclusively as a station wagon (with the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight serving as its largest sedan). For 1992, sales of the model line declined over 40 percent, leading the division to discontinue the model line for 1993 in favor of concentrating resources towards the Bravada SUV and Silhouette minivan.

On June 5, 1992, Oldsmobile produced the final Custom Cruiser station wagon; it would be the final Oldsmobile-brand vehicle produced with a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive. The Custom Cruiser was also the final Oldsmobile produced exclusively with a 3-passenger front bench seat; with the sole exception of the Cutlass Ciera/Cutlass Cruiser, all subsequent vehicles produced by the division were offered with 2-passenger front seating as standard or as an option.

=== Chassis ===
The 1991 and 1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser is based upon the GM B platform, carrying over the 116-inch wheelbase from the previous generation. Primarily through the addition of safety equipment upgrades, the redesign of the Custom Cruiser added nearly 100 pounds of weight to the vehicle (though nearly 650 pounds lighter than a 1976 counterpart).

Following the 1992 discontinuation of the Custom Cruiser, the Buick Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate were produced with no major changes (to the B-body platform) through their 1996 discontinuation, outside of the 1994 replacement of the L05 V8 with the LT1 V8 for 1994.

====Powertrain====

In a central part of the 1991 redesign of the B platform, General Motors retired its practice of divisionally-developed engines in favor of standardizing the Chevrolet small-block V8 across all GM rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. The Oldsmobile 307 from the previous generation was replaced by a 5.0L (305 cubic inch) unit rated at 170 hp (a 30 hp increase over the 307); in a first for a rear-wheel drive Oldsmobile, the V8 was fuel-injected. For 1992, a 180 hp 5.7 L V8 was introduced as an option.

Both engines were paired with the Hydramatic &quot;4L60&quot; 4-speed overdrive automatic (replacing the THM200-4R).
=== Body ===

As with the previous generation, the Custom Cruiser shared nearly its entire body with its Chevrolet and Buick counterparts, sharing design features from both model lines. The body-color split grille was derived nearly entirely from the Chevrolet Caprice, with a fixed second-row skylight shared with the Roadmaster Estate. Though actually 2.8 inches shorter (and 1.8 inches taller) than the previous generation, the low-skirted rear fender wells made the car appear much lower and longer than it was.

In a major break from both its predecessor and the Caprice/Roadmaster, exterior woodgrain trim was discontinued, instead styled with two-tone paint as standard; wire-style wheelcovers were replaced by aluminum-alloy wheels. In another major change, the use of chrome trim was extensively reduced, with body-color bumper covers integrated into the body. While its aerodynamically curved rear roofline proved beneficial for fuel economy, the design forced the retirement of the three-way tailgate. In place of a liftgate (similar to the smaller Cutlass Cruiser), the body was configured with a hatch-type rear window (adding a rear windscreen wiper) and a two-way tailgate. As all Custom Cruisers were fitted with three-row seating, the cargo area was fitted with pop-out vent windows to aid airflow and ventilation.

Though sharing a nearly identical dashboard design as its divisional counterparts (differing primarily in trim), the Custom Cruiser was fitted with its own seat and wood trim design. In contrast to its predecessor, the instrument panel was fitted with a full set of analog gauges (matching the Cutlass Supreme, Touring Sedan, and Troféo). Cloth-trim seats were standard, with leather-trim seats offered as an option. In line with smaller station wagons, a privacy cover was offered as option for the cargo area.

<text>The Buick Roadmaster is an automobile built by Buick from 1936 until 1942, from 1946 until 1958, and then again from 1991 until 1996. Roadmasters produced between 1936 and 1958 were built on Buick&#x27;s longest non-limousine wheelbase and shared their basic structure with the entry-level Cadillac Series 65, the Buick Limited, and after 1940, the Oldsmobile 98. Between 1946 and 1957, the Roadmaster served as Buick&#x27;s flagship.

After being resurrected in 1991, the Roadmaster became the marque&#x27;s largest vehicle, measuring longer with a greater wheelbase than the C-body Buick Park Avenue. This generation was the first in Roadmaster history to be built on the General Motors B-body platform rather than the C-body, which had traditionally been reserved for GM&#x27;s largest and most opulent models that were not Cadillacs. 

A Buick Roadmaster Estate station wagon was introduced in 1947 and was manufactured in several generations through 1996. The final run of 1991-1996 Roadmasters shared powertrains and platforms with the Chevrolet Caprice, Cadillac Fleetwood, and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser.

==1931–1933==
The 1932 Series 80 was the first Buick with the OHV Buick Straight-8 engine developing at 2,800 rpm. It was positioned as an upper category trim package and shared with the Series 90. The Series 80 was a new approach for Buick by marketing a luxury sedan with an eight-cylinder engine - that became expected from luxury brands - comparably as the Oldsmobile L-Series on the GM C platform. The 1932 models introduced a new high-performance engine developing . In 1933, the styling of all Buicks was updated with a new, corporate &quot;streamlined&quot; appearance shared with all GM cars for that year as influenced by GM&#x27;s Art and Color Studio headed by Harley Earl.

The 1933 models were the first year all GM vehicles were installed with optional vent windows that were initially called &quot;No Draft Individually Controlled Ventilation&quot; that was later renamed &quot;Ventiplanes&quot; for which a patent application was filed on November 28, 1932. The patent was assigned to the Ternstedt Manufacturing Company, a GM subsidiary making components for Fisher Body. 

At the end of 1933, the 80 series was discontinued after 24,117 units were produced. In 1936, the model changed its name to &quot;Series 80 Roadmaster&quot;. 

Body style choices were limited to a two-door coupe or four-door sedan in 1931 capable of seating five- or seven-passengers, then replacing the coupe with a Victoria five-passenger coupe in 1932. The 1933 model year saw convertibles for both the coupe and four-door sedan convertible reviving the &quot;phaeton&quot; nameplate again, and additional manufacturing locations opened across the country under the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division. The equipment levels and refinement of materials used were on par with the top-level Limited and was a contender with the Packard Eight.
 

==1936–1937==
The origins of the Roadmaster name date to 1936, when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. Buick&#x27;s Series 40 was named the Special, the Series 50 became the Super, the Series 60 was named the Century and the Series 90 — Buick&#x27;s largest and most luxurious vehicle — was named the Limited. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The 1936 Buick sales brochure describes, &quot;It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway.&quot; The terminology &quot;Series 60&quot; and &quot;Series 70&quot; were shared with Cadillac, while &quot;Series 60&quot;, &quot;Series 70&quot;, &quot;Series 80&quot;, and &quot;Series 90&quot; were shared with Oldsmobile.

The Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick&#x27;s overhead valve straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a , version for the Special, and a , engine for the other series. Buick also adopted an all-steel &quot;turret top&quot; and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were used in the front.

The Roadmaster sedan weighed 4,098 pounds, about 88 pounds more than Cadillac&#x27;s new Series 60. The sedan sold for $1,255 ($ in dollars ), $440 ($ in dollars ) less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 ($ in dollars ) (a total of 1,064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold was priced from $2,745 ($ in dollars ). Buick sales went from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, with the new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing 16,049 units to that total.

Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain the basic 1934 styling for 1935, thus the 1936 re-style brought Buick up with the rest of the GM marques. For the 1937 model year, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were streamlined. Overall height was reduced by while keeping the same interior space. 

A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised the engine rating to . The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system, and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. 

A Formal Sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for US$1,641 ($ in dollars ), of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to US$1,518, and that of the phaeton to US$1,856 ($ in dollars ). Overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.


==1938–1939==
Styling changes for 1938 were modest, with a longer hood extending to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards, and redesigned hubcaps. Changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs and incorporating double-acting shock absorbers four times the size of others. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction, and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new &quot;turbulator&quot; pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase to .

The four-door convertible phaeton changed from the built-in trunk design to a &quot;fastback&quot; rear appearance. The Limited continued to be offered, and a new fastback sedan was added to the line with 466 being sold. The Roadmaster sedan price was increased to US$1,645 ($ in dollars ). The overall automobile market decreased for the year, but Buick&#x27;s share increased even with Roadmaster sales falling to 5,568 and now making up 3.3% of Buick&#x27;s total output from its previous 7.3%.

Styling for 1939 featured a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, the front door pillars were narrower, and the hubcaps were larger. The window area increased substantially with the rear window changing to a one-piece design. All the significant gauges were relocated directly in front of the driver, and the gear shift was changed to a steering column mount. The four-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the latter were sold. Although prices were reduced to US$1,545 ($ in dollars ), sales only rose to 6,097, with Roadmaster&#x27;s share of Buick&#x27;s total sales falling to 2.9%.


==1940–1941==
In 1940, the Series 80 was renamed Buick Limited. The Roadmaster name was transferred to the new Series 70, which was introduced simultaneously as a brand new Series 50 Super. The Roadmaster featured a cutting-edge &quot;torpedo&quot; C-body. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Roadmaster shared with the Super, the Cadillac Series 62, the Oldsmobile Series 90, and the Pontiac Torpedo featured shoulder and hip room that was over wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3&quot; lower. When combined with a column-mounted shift lever the cars offered room for six-passengers.

The 1940 Roadmaster had a shorter wheelbase, weighed less, and was less expensive than the previous year&#x27;s model. The formal and fastback sedans were discontinued. A two-door coupe body style was newly introduced, and 3,991 units were sold. The coach-building firm of Brunn designed several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80, and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have been produced in 1940, an open-front town car, that was dubbed &quot;Townmaster&quot;. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345.

Styling updates for 1941 were modest, but there were mechanical changes. The compression ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the &quot;turbulator&quot; pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were new, and &quot;Compound Carburetion&quot; was introduced. This Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine was rated at . This made it have five more horsepower than a senior Packard, 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest Chryslers, it was the most powerful engine available that year on an American car.

A new body style for this year was a two-door convertible, which sold 1,845 units. There was also a Brunn-designed convertible, but no orders materialized because of the $3,500 price ($ in dollars ). Overall, Roadmaster sales were 15,372.


==1942, 1946–1948==

The 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier than before (a Harley Earl trademark), due in part to a longer wheelbase. There was also a new vertical-bar grille and &quot;Airfoil&quot; fenders that swept back to the rear fenders, which in subsequent generations became the chromed &quot;Sweepspear&quot;. Both features became a Buick icon exhibited in one way or another for years to come, and were influenced by the concept car called the Buick Y-Job. The four-door phaeton was discontinued. Coupes adopted the Sedanet fastback style that was introduced in 1941 on the Century and Special. The new one-piece hood was double-hinged so that either side of the engine compartment could be opened, while in later updates, the hood would open at the front and extend up and towards the passenger compartment.

At the beginning of 1942, new automobiles were available only to those in occupations deemed essential to the war effort. By mid-January, cars with no exterior chrome trim apart from the bumpers were being produced. By February passenger car production was shut down completely. Despite the abbreviated model year, a total of about 8,400 were sold.
When postwar automobile production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome was more sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans and coupes, and a war-inspired &quot;bombsight&quot; hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles, which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. 

Compound Carburetion was discontinued, and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. The 1946 Roadmaster&#x27;s horsepower rating went from 165 to 144. The torque rating was not affected. Nevertheless, The Roadmaster&#x27;s I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top-of-the-line Chrysler&#x27;s. Due to wartime inflation, prices were substantially higher than pre-war models. The most significant change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from 4% in 1941 to 20% in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.

For the 1947 model year, a new stamped grille with a separate upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front, and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and became the top line in the station wagon market.

The 1948 models featured a series script on the front fenders, and the white Tenite steering wheel used previously was replaced with a black version. This also matched the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver-finished instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered: cloth upholstery with leather bolsters, robe cord cover, and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles included power operation for windows, seats, and the top. 

The Dynaflow was introduced, the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year, it became standard equipment for 1949. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.

==1949–1953==




The Roadmaster received its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced, but its weight was marginally increased. The most significant change was a much larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an “observation car.” It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced &quot;VentiPorts.&quot; Four were displayed on each of the Roadmaster and Century&#x27;s front fenders, with three on the fenders of the Super and Special to denote junior level products. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, possibly true in early 1949, but they became non-functional sometime during the model year. 

The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car&#x27;s hood wired to the distributor to flash on and off as each cylinder fired, simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver in the control of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief Harlow Curtice was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the straight-eight engine installed.

Dynaflow was now standard equipment, and engine output was increased to through a slight increase in the compression ratio. With the now-standard Dynaflow, this contributed to giving the new Buicks a top speed of . In the middle of the year, the Riviera joined the body style lineup, selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the two-door Buick Roadmaster Riviera, along with the Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville and the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, was among the first hardtop coupes produced. The Riviera Hardtop was conceived by taking the convertible and welding a steel roof, which simplified manufacture and improved the car&#x27;s appearance.

The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional &quot;Sweepspear&quot; chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, then gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the taillight. The &quot;Riviera trim&quot;, as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible late in the model year. With 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27% of all Buick sales, a high proportion despite its price being slightly less than a Cadillac Series 61.

The 1950 restyling featured a &quot;toothy&quot; grille. The Sweepspear design was made standard on most body styles at the beginning of the 1950 model year, and on the station wagon and a new long-wheelbase sedan mid-year. The long-wheelbase sedan was lengthened by ). Like the convertibles, the Riviera and the long-wheelbase sedan came with power windows and seats as standard equipment. Roadmaster sales fell to 75,034, with Roadmaster&#x27;s share of total Buick output plummeting to 12%.

For the 1951 model year, the long-wheelbase sedan was also called a Riviera, although it was not a hardtop. The Sedanet and regular wheelbase sedan were discontinued.

Styling changes were minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power steering was added as an option in 1952, and the engine rating climbed to primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to decrease to about 66,000 in 1951 and totaled 51,000 units in 1952.

A new V8 engine was introduced for 1953, Buick&#x27;s Golden Anniversary year. Although the Nailhead (as it was popularly called) was nearly identical in displacement to the straight-eight Fireball (322 versus 320 cubic inches), it was shorter, four inches (102 mm) lower, and lighter, but with , it was 11% more powerful. The compression ratio increased from 7.50:1 to 8.50:1 and torque increased from .

The compact dimensions of the V8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster&#x27;s wheelbase by across the line. However, styling differences behind the engine cowl, apart from the new V8 emblem hubcaps, were nonexistent. Buick also introduced a new &quot;Twin-Turbine&quot; Dynaflow as a companion for the V8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option, and a 12-volt electrical system was adopted years before many other makes.

A new body style for 1953 was the Skylark convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and the Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered beltline, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster&#x27;s windshield, the absence of VentiPorts, and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick&#x27;s 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At US$5,000 ($ in dollars ) only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become separate series built on the all-new Century chassis. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last wood-bodied station wagon mass-produced in the United States. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing, which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at US$4,031 ($ in dollars ), the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall, Roadmaster sales went up to 79,137.
==1954–1956==


For the 1954 model year, the Buick Roadmaster and Super shared with Cadillac and Oldsmobile 98 the new General Motors C-body, adopting the new &quot;ponton&quot; appearance, and the addition of &quot;Dagmar bumpers&quot; to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229 mm) longer overall than in 1953. Roadmaster script was placed on the rear quarter panels and within the rear deck ornament. Rear fenders had a blunted fin at the rear edge, with dual &quot;bullet&quot; taillamps below. A new panoramic windshield with vertical side pillars was used. Seats had chrome bands on two-door models, and rear seats had an armrest on four-door models. The front suspension was refined, and Roadmaster&#x27;s engine output was increased to , while the pillared coupe and the Estate wagon were no longer offered as body styles. Overall sales dropped to 50,571 (which was 11% of model year production). and the Roadmaster Convertible was listed at US$3,521 ($ in dollars ). Air conditioning was provided by Frigidaire optionally on sedans and hardtops, which consisted of a self-contained unit that was retrofitted at the customers&#x27; request.
In 1955, broad lower rear fender bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, bars on the wheel covers, and a gold-accented grille were added to distinguish Roadmaster. The engine rating was increased to , and a new variable-pitch Dynaflow, in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back-up lights were now standard. Overall sales were 64,527 (which was 8% of the model year production). and the Roadmaster Convertible replaced the exclusive Roadmaster Skylark convertible.
In 1956, Roadmaster had a shallower Sweepspear that did not dip down to the rocker panel as on other models. Twin chrome strips were on the decklid, and Roadmaster was spelled between them. Roadmaster script was positioned on the doors beneath the vent windows. Fender tip dual bombsights were standard. Two stator wheels were adopted to improve the Dynaflow transmission. A brand new four-door Riviera hardtop, proved to be the most popular Roadmaster, with 24,770 units sold and beating the pillared sedan by more than two-to-one. Overall sales were 53,427 (which was 9% of model year production). A padded dash became standard.
==1957–1958==



The 1957 Roadmaster featured a lowered body style with an even more panoramic windshield with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled Sweepspear lined the bodyside, and a chromed rear fender lower panel filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer &quot;Dagmar bumpers&quot; at the front. A new centered fuel filler was located in the rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was placed within the deck and grille emblems. Two-door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters, while the four-door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear dip. Interiors featured a padded dashboard, broadcloth and nylon in four-door models, nylon in two-door versions, and leather in convertibles. Front hip room was 65.3-in.

A new engine was rated at . A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. The four-door Riviera hardtop proved popular the previous year so that the pillared sedan was dropped from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production (March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 that featured standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one-piece rear window (instead of a three-piece that was a design feature of the smaller Special and Century models), Deluxe hubcaps, and a Series 75 script identification on the rear quarter body panel of the Roadmaster coupes and the rear door panels on the Roadmaster four-door body styles, thus replacing the standard three chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. Overall, Roadmaster sales dropped to about 33,000. The overall economy was in a recession starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.

For the 1958 model year, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

In 1958, the Roadmaster was available in the well-equipped &quot;75&quot; version, and the body was adorned with bulkier and more heavily chromed styling while the top trim package Limited was the most expensive and fully optioned vehicle. A new &quot;drawer pull&quot; grille was used that Buick called &quot;Fashion-Aire Dynastar&quot;, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For the first time since 1948, there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck, the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding, and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year&#x27;s chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes featured cast-iron liners in aluminum drums. Sales fell further to about 14,000.

There was a complete restyling for 1959, but this time, the names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the biggest Buick models were renamed the Electra.
==1991–1996==



The &quot;Roadmaster&quot; name returned to the Buick line for the 1991 model year after a 33-year absence, with the third generation Buick Estate wagon becoming the Roadmaster Estate. A four-door sedan was added to the Roadmaster line for the 1992 model year, the first rear-wheel drive Buick sedan since 1985. Combined sales showed an over tenfold increase over 1991 thanks in part to an extended production run which had 1992 models going on sale in March 1991.

=== Chassis ===
As with its precursor, the new Roadmaster Estate wagon was based on GM&#x27;s full-size rear-wheel drive B platform, which was closely related to the GM C-body and D-body chassis reserved for top of the line Buicks and Cadillacs. It rode on the same wheelbase since the wagon series was downsized from the C-body in 1977, yet it was three inches shorter than the 1990 model.

The Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time. It stood not only as the largest Buick, longer with a greater wheelbase than the apparent top-of-the-line C-bodied Buick Park Avenue, but larger both in wheelbase (2 inches) and overall length (6 inches) than the K-body Cadillac Sedan de Ville.

=== Powertrain ===
The standard engine for the 1991 wagon was a 5.0 L L03 Chevrolet small-block V8. It was replaced a year later with a 5.7 L L05 Chevrolet small-block V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994, both received a substantial power and performance boost with an upgrade to a modified version of the advanced 5.7 L sequential point fuel-injection LT1 V8 introduced two years earlier in the C4 Corvette. Coupled with standard dual exhaust, it increased output to .

This version of the LT1 was shared with a limited range of B-and D platform luxury and performance cars such as the Chevrolet Caprice Police Package and Cadillac Fleetwood, as well as specialty versions of GM&#x27;s two F-bodied pony cars, the Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Engines used in luxury cars had iron instead of aluminum heads for durability, camshafts tuned for increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease engine noise.

While installed partly to better comply with emissions and fuel-economy standards, the LT1 V8 not only offered an power increase, but raised rated fuel economy by 1 mpg, to 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway. As a result of this significantly boosted engine output, General Motors limited the softer-riding Roadmaster (which ran on lower speed-rated tires than used on the Corvette) to a top speed of . For 1996, the LT1 became OBD-II compliant.

All three Roadmaster V-8s were paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1994, the hydraulically-controlled 4L60 (700R4) transmission was replaced by the electronically controlled 4L60E.

When ordered with the factory towing package, the 1994 through 1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to . For the station wagon, this could be raised to 7,000 pounds with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory-installed self-leveling rear suspension called Dynaride, which consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.

=== Body ===
The Roadmaster Estate wagon shared its body with the Caprice Estate and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser; common styling features included the Caprice&#x27;s headlights and the Custom Cruiser&#x27;s 2nd-row &quot;Vista Roof&quot; with a sunroof. Simulated woodgrain sides were standard, though the treatment could be removed for credit. All three wagons offered an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing the seating capacity to eight. The Roadmaster sedan had a distinct fascia, featuring its grille and headlights stacked above running lights and turn signals. It shared a formal sedan roofline with the Cadillac Fleetwood, but was nine inches shorter in length and six inches in wheelbase. The 1995 and 1996 sedan models no longer had the Roadmaster emblem mounted on the quarter panels. 

The interior was redesigned for the 1994 model year, which included new dual airbags, moving some instrument panel gauges closer to the steering wheel, and revisions to the radio and climate controls. The side-view mirrors were changed in 1995, changing from a &quot;Lolipop&quot; style mirror mounted on the door skin, to a new folding design mounted on the sail panel. The 1995 Roadmaster retained its skirted rear wheels (removed from the Caprice/Impala SS), while the sedan was updated with new bodyside moldings. Station wagons saw a shade for the Vista Roof and a cargo cover. In 1996, automatic climate control became standard, and the rear seatbelts were redesigned with a &quot;cinching&quot; feature.

=== Discontinuation ===
With production of over 200,000 Roadmasters over six years, a combination of overcrowding among Buick&#x27;s high-end sedans and pressure from full-size SUVs on the Estate wagon led to GM focusing on higher profit margin vehicles, such as pickups and the truck-bodied Chevrolet Suburban. In 1996, the Arlington Assembly facility in Texas was converted to assemble SUVs and pickup trucks, marking the end of Roadmaster production. The final vehicle was built on December 13, 1996. All 1996 Roadmaster Estates received a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; hood ornament in place of the traditional tri-shield Buick badge.

With Ford stopping production of its Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons in 1991, the discontinuation of the Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate marked the end of the full-size station wagon until the introduction of the 20-inch shorter, 5-inch narrower LX-bodied Dodge Magnum wagon in 2005.

<doc id="1118747" wikidata="Q5513847" url="?curid=1118747" title="General Motors D platform">
<text>The GM D platform (informally, D-body), was a General Motors automobile platform designation, used in two series (1936–1984 and 1985–1996) for large body-on-frame rear-wheel drive automobiles. For the majority of its existence the D-Body represented the largest Cadillac, either the Fleetwood Series 75 or the Fleetwood Limousine.

In 1985 GM downsized and redesignated its traditional large car rear wheel drive GM C platform as the new much smaller and lighter front wheel drive GM C platform. It also shifted its traditional, D platform Fleetwood limousine to the new C platform, ending production of the historic D platform. In turn, it redesignated the former RWD C platform the new D platform, and maintained production of a few RWD holdovers on it.

The original D platform was closely related to GM&#x27;s other two rear-wheel drive large car platforms: the mainstream GM B and the upscale C platforms. But save for the limited production top-of-the-line 1936–1942 Buick Limited, the original GM D-platform was exclusive to Cadillac, GM&#x27;s most luxurious brand. As GM&#x27;s largest, the &quot;new&quot; D platform designated in 1985 was reserved to Cadillac through the end of its production in 1996.

== Model History ==
===1936–1984 original D-Body===
During most of the 20th century the D-Body represented GM&#x27;s largest and most exclusive car platform. The D-body was used for the Cadillac Series 85 from 1936 through 1937, for the Cadillac Series 90 from 1936 through 1940, for the Buick Limited from 1936 through 1942, for the Cadillac Series 72 in 1940, for the Cadillac Series 67 from 1941 through 1942, for the Cadillac Fleetwood Series 75 from 1936 through 1976, and for the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine from 1977 through 1984.

===1985–1996 former RWD C-Body===

In 1985 GM reassigned the name of its traditional large car rear wheel drive GM C platform to its new much smaller and lighter front wheel drive GM C platform. Most of its large cars made the downsizing shift with it. However, the former C platform continued in limited use, being redesignated the &quot;D platform&quot; and employed by the 1985–1986 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, its direct successor 1987–1992 Cadillac Brougham, and 1993–1996 Cadillac Fleetwood, which reverted from being front-wheel drive 1985–1992 to rear-wheel drive

Compounding the confusion, the Cadillac Series 70 Fleetwood limousine, which had been built on the venerable original GM D platform (that traced its origins to 1936), was replaced in 1985 by the dramatically downsized C-platform Cadillac Series 75. This marked the end of the original D platform. Two years later the C platform Series 75 was discontinued, bringing to a close the Cadillac limousine era.

==Production==
Early designation D-bodies (1936–1984), with the exception of the Buick Limited, which was produced in Flint, Michigan, were all produced at Detroit Assembly, Detroit, Michigan. Since all Fleetwood Broughams were being produced in Detroit prior to the name change, initially all late designation D-bodies (1985–1996) were built there as well. During the 1988 model year production of D-bodies was shifted to Arlington Assembly, Arlington, Texas where it remained until the last D-bodied car was built in 1996.

Production ended in 1996, leaving GM without a rear wheel drive luxury sedan. Later Cadillac introduced smaller cars on the Sigma platform. The spiritual successor of the D-Body Fleetwood is the Sedan de Ville d&#x27;Elegance which was later replaced by the Sedan de Ville High Luxury.

<doc id="1118748" wikidata="Q1826895" url="?curid=1118748" title="Linn Boyd">
<text>Linn Boyd (November 22, 1800 – December 17, 1859) (also spelled &quot;Lynn&quot;) was a prominent US politician of the 1840s and 1850s, and served as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1851 to 1855. Boyd was elected to the House as a Jacksonian from Kentucky from 1835 to 1837 and again as a Democrat from 1839 to 1855, serving seven terms in the House. Boyd County, Kentucky is named in his honor.

==Early and family life==

Born to the wife of part-time delegate Abraham Boyd in Trigg County, Kentucky, he was raised and educated to some minimal extent in Trigg County. In 1832, Boyd married fellow Trigg County native Alice C. Bennett. In 1850, the widower married a widow from Pennsylvania, Anna L. Dixon.

==Early career==

Boyd moved to Calloway County to farm in 1826. The next year he became Calloway County&#x27;s delegate in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served alongside his father (who represented Trigg County) in 1828–1829. In 1831 Boyd moved back to Trigg County and its voters elected him to represent them in the state House.

==U.S. Congressman==
In 1833, Boyd lost his first campaign for the United States House of Representatives. In 1835 he was elected to the House and served there until 1837, when a Whig landslide resulting from the Panic of 1837 cost him his seat.

Kentucky voters of the First Congressional District soon returned Boyd to the House, and he would serve from 1839 through 1855. He was a strong supporter of President Andrew Jackson. Boyd played a key role in maneuvering the annexation of Texas through Congress during the term of President John Tyler in 1845. Boyd was also important in getting the Compromise of 1850, chiefly credited to Henry Clay, passed through Congress. Largely though his prominence in shepherding the compromise to passage, Boyd was elected Speaker of the House in 1851 and held that office until 1855.

While in the House, he sufficiently impressed his colleague Charles S. Benton that he named his son, the future inventor and businessman Linn Boyd Benton, after him.

==Later career==
While still in Congress, Boyd declined a nomination for Governor of Kentucky in 1848 and was replaced by Lazarus W. Powell. In 1852, he moved to Paducah.

After leaving the House, he was mentioned as a candidate for Vice President of the United States at the 1856 Democratic National Convention but was never officially nominated; the eventual nominee was fellow Kentuckian John C. Breckinridge.

Kentucky voters elected Boyd the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1859, but he died after less than four months in office. This became significant with the onset of the Civil War. Governor Beriah Magoffin, who supported slavery, secession, and states&#x27; rights, became increasingly unpopular and distrusted as he sought to keep Kentucky on a neutral course between the Union and the Confederate States of America. Unionists held a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly in the summer of 1861 and frequently overrode Magoffin&#x27;s vetoes. By August 1862, Magoffin made it clear that he was willing to resign the governorship. However, due to Linn Boyd&#x27;s death, the person next in line to become Governor of Kentucky was Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk, whom Magoffin thought unacceptable. After Fisk resigned as Speaker and was replaced by James F. Robinson, Magoffin resigned. Thus, Robinson became governor, and Fisk was reinstalled as Speaker of the Senate.

==Death and burial==
Boyd died in Paducah on December 17, 1859. He was buried at Paducah&#x27;s Oak Grove Cemetery. Oaklands, a spacious brick home he had built in Paducah in 1852, no longer exists except as a street name.

<doc id="1118753" wikidata="Q600329" url="?curid=1118753" title="Cadillac Brougham">
<text>The Cadillac Brougham is a line of full-size luxury cars manufactured by the Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors from the 1987 through 1992 model years and was marketed from 1977 to 1986 as the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. The optional &quot;d&#x27;Elegance&quot; trim package that was introduced during the Fleetwood era remained available. The model received a facelift in 1990 and was replaced by the 1993 rear wheel drive D-body Cadillac Fleetwood.

==History==
Originally used for a single horse drawn enclosed carriage for 2-4 people, the “Brougham” owes its name to British statesman, Henry Brougham. Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style. In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with an open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often &quot;razor-edged&quot; styling. When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926. After 1937, the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period.

The Brougham name would eventually reappear on the 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham show car which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years. The 1957 Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.

After a five-year absence, the Brougham name reappeared as an option package on the 1965 Cadillac Sixty Special. The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special. This continued through 1970. Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham. When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham took its place as Cadillac&#x27;s largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986.

The single name &quot;Brougham&quot; began to be used as specific Cadillac model in 1987, when the term &quot;Fleetwood&quot; was dropped from the former Fleetwood Brougham. It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model. The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the Fleetwood. Compounding the confusion, the optional &quot;d&#x27;Elegance&quot; package (introduced in the upscale Fleetwood trim line in the 1970s, offering even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat reading lamps), was available on and appended to the names of both models, resulting in a traditional body-on-frame/rear-wheel drive &quot;Fleetwood Brougham d&#x27; Elegance&quot; and a unibody/transverse engined &quot;Fleetwood d&#x27; Elegance&quot;. The solution was dropping the term &quot;Fleetwood&quot; from the rear-wheel drive model, leaving just the &quot;Brougham&quot;. Since it was body-on-frame, it was popular among coachbuilders who manufactured stretched limousines, along with the similar but somewhat smaller Lincoln Town Car, as well as traditional Cadillac buyers who preferred the familiar combination of exterior size, heft, and rear-wheel drive. This was the last Cadillac to be produced without airbags.

The 1987 Brougham was built at the Clark Street Cadillac Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, as the Fleetwood Brougham had been in 1985–86. Before the shift to the Arlington Assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, some early model year 1988s were produced at Detroit Assembly in late 1987 before the plant&#x27;s December closure, and construction continued at Arlington through 1992. The 11th digit of the VIN indicates plant assembly. A &quot;9&quot; as the 11th digit indicates a Detroit Brougham; a &quot;R&quot; indicates an Arlington Brougham. Many of the Arlington assembled examples also had a state of Texas/GM Arlington decal on the rear side quarter glass.

VIN &quot;9&quot; Broughams were produced 1986–1990 and, although rare, can be found as &quot;commercial chassis&quot; vehicles, and generally have a higher output Oldsmobile 307 LG8 Engine and different transmissions (typically the TH400 three speed), depending on the use. Generally speaking, minor differences between 1987 and 1988 (VIN 9 and Y) can be found, such as carburetor assembly. While these cars all used Rochester Quadrajet Electronic four-barrel carburetors, differences include an electronic (Detroit) versus vacuum (Arlington) Idle Load Compensator, as well as an electronic (Detroit) versus climactic (Arlington) choke system. The vin &quot;9&quot; engine is the high output version of the base LV2 307 vin code Y and shares most parts with it. The HO engine is the same engine that was used in the rear wheel drive Oldsmobile 442. While the engine was not powerful, it proved to be a reliable engine with proven, but dated, technology.

The Brougham wore a cross-hatch grille in 1987 and 1988 which was an identical re-cast of the 1981 Fleetwood Brougham/DeVille grille. The Brougham received a new vertical-slat grille for 1989, which was equal to the 1982–86 grille with 3 horizontal sections. A 1990 facelift, the only one since the Fleetwood Brougham was restyled for 1980, was necessitated by a radically redesigned Town Car from rival Lincoln. For 1990, the Brougham received a new digital instrument cluster inside, and composite headlamps, contemporary taillamp lenses, flush bumper moldings, new lower body moldings and an optional Chevrolet 350 V8. Additionally, door-mounted front seatbelts became standard in order to meet federal safety standards as the 1990 Brougham was the only Cadillac model without a driver&#x27;s side airbag. 

For 1991, the &quot;LV2&quot; V8 was replaced by a &quot;Chevrolet&quot; FI V8 that produced , while the &quot;Chevrolet 350&quot; produced . The 1992 Brougham received no major changes, as it was the final year. The fuel injected engines proved to be reliable contenders and provided a marked power improvement over the Oldsmobile 307 carbureted engines.
For 1988–1989, the &quot;Premier Formal Vinyl Roof&quot; option became available, costing $1,095 and covering the roof as well as the B-pillar and the rear quarter window surround. For 1990, a variation of this roof treatment became standard in conjunction with the Brougham&#x27;s facelift that year.

==Discontinuation==
The Cadillac Brougham was discontinued in 1992. The Fleetwood name returned as a RWD model with a major redesign for 1993 (the FWD Fleetwood had been renamed Sixty Special that year) and Brougham again became an option package, as it had been in 1965.

<text>During 1879 and 1880, the Seney Syndicate linked together several short railroads in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to form the Lake Erie and Western Railroad.

The Seney Syndicate was headed by George I. Seney, a New York banker. Eastern members of the Syndicate included the successful speculators John T. Martin, Edward H. R. Lyman, Alexander M. White, and Walston H. Brown.

The westerns members appear to have been dominated by Calvin S. Brice, a 35-year-old Lima, Ohio, attorney who had been instrumental in the formation of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad. Also from Ohio were members Charles Foster, then Governor of Ohio; Dan P. Eells of Cleveland; and General Samuel R. Thomas of Columbus, Ohio.

The members of the Syndicate from Illinois included Columbus R. Cummings and William B. Howard, both men with experience with the construction and the management of railroad properties.

In addition to controlling the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, the Seney Syndicate controlled the 2500-mile East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville Railway and the Ohio Central Railroad. The Ohio Central extended from Toledo, Ohio, to the Hocking Valley coal fields and it crossed the Lake Erie and Western at Fostoria, Ohio.

<doc id="1118759" wikidata="Q6531941" url="?curid=1118759" title="Lester Roloff">
<text>Lester Leo Roloff (June 28, 1914 – November 2, 1982) was an American fundamentalist Independent Baptist preacher and the founder of teen homes across the American South. The operation of those teen homes (primarily his Rebekah Home for Girls) placed him in the public spotlight.

== Early ministry ==
Born of German descent, Roloff was reared in Dawson in Navarro County in east-central Texas. He began preaching at the age of 18. He attended Baylor University in Waco (Roloff is reported to have brought his dairy cow with him to raise tuition funds through the sale of its milk), and later Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.

After graduation, Roloff began preaching at small country churches in southern Texas before taking on pastoral duties at churches in Houston and later Corpus Christi.

== The Family Altar ==
In Corpus Christi in 1944, Roloff began his radio show, &quot;The Family Altar&quot;. The show consists of recordings of his sermons, aired in both 15- and 30-minute programs. Roloff also incorporated singing into his sermons, and would occasionally break into impromptu singing of hymns and/or leading his choir to sing along. Each program has recordings of Roloff singing &quot;When Jesus Comes (One Sat Alone Beside the Highway)&quot; at the beginning and &quot;The Stranger Who Sat by the Sea&quot; (or the congregational hymn &quot;Living by Faith&quot;) at the end, accompanied only by organ.

== Ministry expands ==
In 1950, Roloff was called upon to fill in as preacher at a series of revival meetings in Corpus Christi after the scheduled speaker, B. B. Crim, died. The enthusiastic reaction to Roloff&#x27;s preaching led him to resign his pastorate and pursue full-time evangelism. Roloff Evangelistic Enterprises was hence incorporated the following year.

Roloff preached stridently against homosexuality, communism, television, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gluttony, and psychology. His strong stands led to disagreements with most of his Southern Baptist brethren. In 1956, after giving a speech at his alma mater Baylor University criticizing denominationalism, Roloff broke with the SBC and joined the Independent Baptist movement.

In 1954, Roloff returned to pastoral ministry with the establishment of the Alameda Street Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, an Independent Baptist congregation. He remained there until 1961, when he resumed full-time evangelistic ministry. In 1967, he started another Independent Baptist church in Corpus Christi, Peoples Baptist Church, at which he remained until his death.

== The Roloff Homes ==
Roloff began actively ministering to alcoholic and homeless men. His first mission house was established in Corpus Christi in 1954. Additional children&#x27;s homes were eventually added throughout Texas, Oklahoma, and Georgia. The first Roloff home for females, Rebekah Home for Girls, was established in 1968, which brought in young girls who were addicted to drugs, involved in prostitution, serving jail time, kicked out of their homes, or in need of refuge.

The only literature permitted to those living in the Roloff homes was the King James Version of the Bible. Television was forbidden, and only one hour of radio per day was permitted, to listen to Roloff&#x27;s radio sermons. Daily church attendance was mandatory; each Roloff home had its own church and pastor on the grounds. Other policies, in accordance to the state, included windows being locked and alarm systems to prevent any truancy or escape. Contact with the outside world was denied except for monitored phone calls with parents. In addition, each dorm room had an intercom and loudspeaker.

In December 2001, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; reported on the (then closed) Rebekah Home:

Some of the homes were temporarily closed in 1973 because Roloff refused on church-state issues to license the home through the state government. The institutions reopened in 1974 after Roloff successfully appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled in Roloff&#x27;s favor that it was unconstitutional to close the homes down. At one point, Roloff transferred ownership of the homes from his evangelistic corporation to his church, thus compelling the state to sue the &quot;new&quot; owners (and restart the entire litigation) while he kept the homes running. The Attorney General refiled the case and secured an injunction that tried to shut down the ministry. In 1975, the state passed laws that required the licensing of youth homes. Roloff was arrested twice for refusing to comply with this law.

In 1979, in an incident known as the &quot;Christian Alamo&quot;, Roloff urged churches and pastors across America who supported his ministry to come to Corpus Christi and form a human chain around the church to prevent the Texas Department of Human Resources from removing children from the homes. Even after his death, legal battles with the State of Texas continued, and ultimately the homes were closed in 1985.

However, the homes reopened in 1997 after a new law was passed that allowed faith-based institutions to opt out of state licensing requirements. The law was subject to renewal in 2001 and was not renewed at that time (primarily on the basis that, of the then 2,015 faith-based institutions operating various types of child-care facilities, only a mere seven chose the opt-out provision), whereupon the homes were once again closed.

== Death ==
Roloff had always had a fascination with flight. He purchased his first airplane in 1954 and used it to travel between his various speaking engagements throughout the country. On November 2, 1982, the same day that the Democrat Mark Wells White, the outgoing attorney general, unseated Republican Governor Bill Clements, Roloff&#x27;s plane crashed during a storm outside Normangee, Texas. Roloff and a ladies&#x27; singing trio from the home for adult women, along with another woman working at the home, were killed. White had vowed, if elected governor, to shut down Roloff&#x27;s homes. The wreckage of the crashed airplane used to be a centerpiece of Roloff Park at Hyles-Anderson College, a Bible college in Crown Point, Indiana, partly named for the pastor Jack Hyles.

== Roloff&#x27;s legacy ==
Roloff is cited as a major influence on both the Christian fundamentalist homeschooling and youth movements. His final recorded sermon was preached at Tennessee Temple University in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is entitled &quot;Hills that Help&quot;. Roloff was posthumously inducted in 1993 into the National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

Roloff Evangelistic Enterprises is still in operation and the ministry continues to broadcast reruns of &quot;The Family Altar&quot; program on smaller, privately owned radio stations, as well as shortwave radio, and sell copies of Roloff&#x27;s sermons. In 2017, the organization moved its mailing address to Fort Thomas, Arizona, and relocated its operations to a nearby Native American facility, which it opened in the early 1980s.

People&#x27;s Baptist Church also remains in operation, but no longer operates teenager group homes. The church now operates homes for adult men and women being treated for alcohol and drug addiction.

The Roloff homes have a legacy of accusations. Many have accused them of abuse, while Roloff argued that strict discipline was necessary for proper correction. Throughout the history of the Roloff homes, there have been claims of abuse and brainwashing from former students, while there also exists denial from staff and some former students claiming that these allegations are exaggerated.

== Beliefs ==

=== Soteriology ===
In Lester Roloff&#x27;s sermon, &quot;Dr. Law and Dr. Grace.&quot;, Roloff described the law as revealing humanity&#x27;s sins and exposing their inability to attain righteousness through their own works. This understanding, he explained, serves to guide individuals toward grace, where they can find forgiveness and redemption. Lester Roloff taught that one can only be saved through faith in Jesus Christ&#x27;s shed blood and his atoning death, and that assurance of salvation is possible. He strongly defended the doctrine of eternal security.

Roloff believed that even when a person is born again, they still have their old sinful nature alongside their new Spiritual nature.

=== Eschatology ===
Lester Roloff believed in the pretribulational rapture, teaching that the rapture is imminent and could happen at any time.

=== Bibliology ===
Lester Roloff was King James Only, stating that .he looked upon the King James Bible the same way he looks upon his mother, believing that modern versions wrongly omit verses from the Bible. He in his sermons also often advocated for memorizing the Bible.

=== Health ===
Roloff&#x27;s views on health from a biblical standpoint remain influential among some Christians today. He highly recommended raw, uncooked fruits, vegetables, eggs, and cheese, as well as fasting and drinking vegetable juice, and taught that the diet found in Leviticus chapter 11 should be followed. Other viewpoints on health included total abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, and television.

Roloff also advocated for a reform of modern medicine. He once said in a sermon, &quot;We&#x27;re looking for a color-coded new world: a green pill for anxiety, and yellow pill for frustration, an orange pill for unhappiness, a black pill for a bad day at the office, and a white one when all else fails ... I believe that these pills are not necessary; only because there&#x27;s a certain man in this country that has failed to give the right pill. The preacher has not given the god-pill. Therefore, they&#x27;re on every pill you can think of, and none of them are working.&quot;

<text>The Lake Erie and Western Railroad was a railroad that operated in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. The Lake Erie and Western main line extended from Sandusky, Ohio, westward to Peoria, Illinois, passing through Fremont and Fostoria, Ohio, Muncie and Lafayette, Indiana, and Bloomington, Illinois. It also had main lines extending from Indianapolis to Michigan City, Indiana and from Fort Wayne to Connersville, Indiana. Principal branch lines extended from St. Marys&#x27; to Minster, Ohio and from New Castle to Rushville, Indiana.

The Lake Erie and Western Depot Historic District at Kokomo, Indiana, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

== Beginning and growth ==
The Lake Erie and Western Railroad was incorporated in Illinois, February 10, 1887. The &quot;Natural Gas Route&quot; had its beginnings in several railroads dating back to the mid-1850s, the oldest being the President and Directors of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad Company, incorporated in Indiana, January 19, 1846. The Seney Syndicate linked several short railroads in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois along with the first &quot;The Lake Erie and Western Railway Company&quot; of 1879. Subsequent consolidations and foreclosure sales resulted in variations of the Lake Erie and Western name, culminating in the Lake Erie and Western Railroad.

== Control ==
The Lake Erie and Western itself controlled and leased the Northern Ohio Railway and jointly controlled 10% of the Peoria and Pekin Union Railway.

In 1900, the Lake Erie and Western came under the control of the New York Central Railroad. After operating it as a separate entity for two decades, the New York Central sold the Lake Erie and Western to the Nickel Plate in 1922.

<doc id="1118765" wikidata="Q2309756" url="?curid=1118765" title="Spider Baby">
<text>Spider Baby: or, the Maddest Story Ever Told is a 1967 American comedy horror film, written and directed by Jack Hill. It stars Lon Chaney Jr. as Bruno, the chauffeur and caretaker of three orphaned siblings who suffer from &quot;Merrye Syndrome&quot;, a genetic condition starting in early puberty that causes them to regress mentally, socially and physically. Jill Banner, Carol Ohmart, Quinn Redeker, Beverly Washburn, Sid Haig, Mary Mitchel, Karl Schanzer and Mantan Moreland also star.

The film was released to relative obscurity, but eventually achieved cult status.

==Plot==
At the decaying Merrye House, feared by locals, the Merrye children Ralph, Virginia, and Elizabeth have lived in seclusion with the family chauffeur Bruno ever since their parents died. All three have advanced Merrye Syndrome, a genetic affliction unique to members of the family which causes them, starting in late childhood, to regress down the evolutionary ladder mentally and physically. They exhibit a playful innocence well before their years, mixed with feral madness.

Ralph is a sexually advanced, but mentally deficient simpleton who moves through the house via the dumb-waiter. Virginia is obsessed with spiders, and has more than once murdered visitors in a game of &quot;spider&quot;, trapping them by rigging a window to snap shut on them, before hacking them to death with butcher knives. Elizabeth is regarded by Bruno as the most responsible of the three, but is also conniving and infatuated with the concept of hate. The children hold a steadfast respect and affection for Bruno, but increasingly disregard his admonitions against their darker impulses.

Virginia&#x27;s latest victim is a delivery man serving notice that Peter Howe and his sister Emily, distant relatives of the Merrye family, are coming with their lawyer Schlocker and his secretary Ann, seeking to claim the property as rightful heirs. Bruno hastily coaches the children in enough social etiquette to pass muster before the visitors arrive. Schlocker is outraged that the children have been in the sole care of Bruno (who did not acquire legal guardianship) and have never attended school. Bruno tells him the children are mentally retarded and resists the suggestion to put them in an institution, having sworn to their father to protect them for life. Emily and Schlocker insist on staying overnight to examine the situation, but with only two rooms available, Peter takes Ann into town to stay at an inn.

Schlocker investigates the house, going down to the basement, where he finds the Merrye patriarch&#x27;s siblings are kept in a pit. Virginia and Elizabeth murder Schlocker to prevent him from reporting this discovery. Bruno realizes it will be impossible to keep this latest murder covered up, and leaves to fetch dynamite from a nearby construction site, planning to blow up the entire Merrye family rather than allow them to be confined. In his absence, Emily finds Schlocker&#x27;s body as Virginia and Elizabeth are trying to dispose of it. The girls chase Emily out into the woods, where she is captured and raped by Ralph.

Finding no rooms available in town, Peter and Ann return to the mansion. Elizabeth, fearing the consequences if their crimes are discovered, escorts Ann to her room, leading her into the clutches of Ralph, while Virginia starts a game of &quot;spider&quot; with Peter, tying him to a chair and preparing to &quot;sting&quot; him with her knives. Elizabeth intervenes to ask for help with Ann, who is struggling against her and Ralph.

In the woods, Emily awakes traumatised and delirious. Sexually aggressive and murderous, she returns to the house and attacks Ralph while his sisters defend him. Meanwhile, Peter escapes his confinement and frees Ann. Bruno arrives with the dynamite and urges Peter to flee. Peter escorts Ann to safety as the house explodes behind them, killing Bruno and the Merrye family.

Peter, as the sole remaining heir, inherits the vast Merrye family fortune, marries Ann, and writes a book on the Merrye Syndrome phenomenon. His branch of the family, being rather distant, has never been afflicted by the syndrome. However, ten years later, while wandering outside, Peter and Ann&#x27;s young daughter is fascinated by a spider.

==Cast==
* Lon Chaney Jr. as Bruno (as Lon Chaney)
* Carol Ohmart as Emily Howe
* Quinn Redeker as Peter Howe
* Beverly Washburn as Elizabeth
* Jill Banner as Virginia
* Sid Haig as Ralph
* Mary Mitchel as Ann
* Karl Schanzer as Schlocker

==Production==

While working as a private investigator, Karl Schanzer mentioned to two of his clients, Gil Lasky and Paul Monka, that he was an out-of-work actor. Struck by the coincidence, they in turn told him that they were interested in producing a movie, and Schanzer pointed them towards director/screenwriter Jack Hill, who he had met while working on &quot;Blood Bath&quot;. At the time Hill had not even the beginnings of a script for the film he wanted to make, but Lasky and Monka were impressed enough with his rough outline to green light the project.

Hill wrote the script with Lon Chaney Jr. in mind for the part of Bruno, but though Chaney read and liked the script, his agent said that the maximum fee the producers could offer for the film&#x27;s lead role - $2,500 - was far too little for an actor of Chaney&#x27;s prestige, especially since horror films were what he was most renowned for. However, when the producers later sent an inquiry as to whether John Carradine (who was represented by the same agent as Chaney) would be interested in the role, the agent wrote back saying that Chaney would accept the part for the offered $2,500.

Hill wanted Mantan Moreland for the part of the messenger because he believed that in light of Moreland being known for comedic roles, his character being brutally murdered would be a good opening shock to audiences.

The location chosen was the (now historic) Smith Estate in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The film was shot between August and September 1964. However, due to the original producers&#x27; bankruptcy, the film was not released until December 24, 1967. &quot;Spider Baby&quot; suffered from poor marketing as well as a series of title changes, being billed alternatively as The Liver Eaters, Attack of the Liver Eaters, Cannibal Orgy, and The Maddest Story Ever Told. Although these alternate titles have little or no relation to the plot, the latter two appear in the opening narration by Chaney: &quot;This cannibal orgy is strange to behold in the maddest story ever told.&quot; The opening titles of the film also dub it Spider Baby or, The Maddest Story Ever Told. Hill conceived the title &quot;The Maddest Story Ever Told&quot; as a play on the title of the then-recent film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;.

The cinematographer was Alfred Taylor, who had previously worked on the film &quot;The Atomic Brain&quot;. There was no power available in the Smith Estate when the opening scene was filmed, so Taylor arranged a series of reflectors to guide sunlight into the house and thereby provide lighting for the interior shots. The entire production cost about $65,000, and took only 12 days to shoot in black and white. The film was released as a double bill with &quot;Hell&#x27;s Chosen Few&quot;.

==Release==
Hill recalled those financing the film had a real estate business that went bankrupt with the film was locked up in a vault for three years. A friend of his, David L. Hewitt had seen the film and kept track of it through all the litigation. Hewitt re-edited the film that Hill thought improved the film.
&quot;Spider Baby&quot; first opened theatrically in Fremont, Ohio, as a double feature with Hewitt&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Mars&quot; on December 8, 1967. It opened in Shreveport, Louisiana, the following week, on December 13, 1967.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.16/10. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars, saying, &quot;At its best it&#x27;s both scary and funny.&quot; Bruce G. Hallenbeck commented in his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot; that &quot;&quot;Spider Baby&quot; has a diseased, sickly atmosphere that anticipates that of David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1976), with Alfred Taylor&#x27;s black and white cinematography contributing images of death and decay that are still disturbing today.&quot; He particularly noted Lon Chaney, Jr.&#x27;s performance as being among the actor&#x27;s best, portraying Bruno as a likable but misguided &quot;enabler&quot; for his wards.

===Home media===
In 1999, a DVD of the film&#x27;s original laserdisc transfer was released, including a cast and crew reunion and a commentary track by Hill. In 2007, Dark Sky Films released a version featuring Hill&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut, a new commentary with co-star Haig and multiple documentaries on the making of the film. In 2015, British home video distributor Arrow Films released a director-approved Blu-ray/DVD combo special edition of the film.

==Legacy==
In 2009, &quot;Spider Baby&quot; writer/director Hill and END Films launched the &quot;official &quot;Spider Baby&quot; website&quot;, featuring historical information about the film, director/cast biographies, video clips and photo galleries.

===&quot;Spider Baby The Musical&quot;===

A rock and roll musical stage version of &quot;Spider Baby&quot;, directed by Helen Acosta, featured libretto and music by Enrique Acosta with lyrics by Enrique Acosta, Lorien Patton, and Helen Acosta. It was originally developed at Empty Space Theatre in Bakersfield in 2004 and had gone through several other developmental workshops. It played small community theaters, looking for a wider audience. It opened at the Empty Space theater in Bakersfield, California, on Halloween 2004. In October 2007, it opened in Brookings, Oregon, at the local Grange Hall, and in Orlando, Florida, at the Black Orchid Theater.

In 2009, the musical toured with stops in Fresno, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Tehachapi and San Francisco. A 2010 multi-city tour had stops in Las Vegas, Toronto, and Los Angeles.

The musical played from October 15 to December 5, 2010 at The Lyric Hyperion Theatre Cafe in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.

In 2012, it played in San Diego, California, at the 10th Avenue Arts Centre as part of Gamercon and Terror at the 10th, respectively.

The soundtrack for the musical version was the final project at Buck Owens&#x27; recording studio in Bakersfield.

===In music===
The film&#x27;s theme song has been covered at least three times: By the band Fantômas on their film-score covers album &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, by crossover thrash band The Accüsed on 1988&#x27;s &quot;Martha Splatterhead&#x27;s Maddest Stories Ever Told&quot; as &quot;The Maddest Story Ever Told&quot;, and by Kid Congo Powers.

In 2023, Waxwork Records released the soundtrack as part of the Rob Zombie Presents series. It was pressed on coloured vinyl and housed in special packaging featuring artwork by Graham Humphreys.

===Remake===
In 2007, independent film producer Tony DiDio began preparing a remake of the film, featuring original director Hill as executive producer, and Jeff Broadstreet as director.

Broadstreet stated in an interview, &quot;We&#x27;re going to stick very closely to the basic story of the original film, and at the same time dig deeper into the backstory of the inbred Merrye family.&quot; The new script by Robert Valding &quot;expands on the themes of unconditional love, and also the story elements of cannibalism and the mutant relatives in the basement&quot;.

It was announced in 2023 that filmmaker Dustin Ferguson acquired the rights to &quot;Spider Baby&quot; and planned to produce a remake. The remake premiered at the Frida Cinema in Santa Ana, CA on October 31, 2023.

==Preservation and archival status==
In 2012, the film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, using the original camera negative. A new fine grain master positive, new duplicate negative and new prints were created, as well as analog and digital soundtrack masters.

<text>Nestlé Purina PetCare (), or simply Purina, an American subsidiary of the Swiss corporation Nestlé, based in St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in 1893 by William H. Danforth. It produces and markets pet food, treats, and cat and dog litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina One. The company was formed in 2001 by combining Nestlé&#x27;s Friskies PetCare Company with Ralston Purina, which acquired it for $10.3 billion. , it is the second-largest pet food company globally (the first being Mars Petcare) and the largest in the United States.

==Corporate history==

===Origins===
In 1894, William H. Danforth partnered with George Robinson and William Andrews, as they entered the business of feeding farm animals by founding the Purina Mills in St. Louis, Missouri. The name was changed to Ralston Purina in 1902. This was the same year, 1902 when Ralston Purina built its first building at the current headquarters, 800 Chouteau Ave, St. Louis, Missouri. Nestlé Purina PetCare was formed in December 2001, when Nestlé acquired Ralston Purina for $10.3 billion and merged it with Nestlé&#x27;s pet food business, Friskies PetCare Company. At the same time, the pet food division was sold to the Swiss company Nestlé. Ralston had marketed the Dog Chow, Cat Chow and Pro Plan pet food brands, while Nestlé produced Friskies and Alpo brand pet foods.

The merger was opposed by consumer advocates, such as the Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns. The two companies combined would become the largest pet food brand by market share with a 45 percent share of the cat food market. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners, creating the separate Meow Mix Company. Ralston&#x27;s St. Louis, Missouri location was chosen as the new company&#x27;s North American headquarters.

In 2001, Cargill acquired Agribrands International and decided to retain the Purina brand. At the same time, the pet food division was sold to the Nestlé Group.

===Early history===
Nestlé Purina PetCare continued integrating the two companies through 2002. It cut back dry dog food manufacturing at facilities inherited from Friskies PetCare Company in Jefferson, Wisconsin, St. Joseph, Missouri and Arden Hills, Minnesota, then moved those operations to manufacturing facilities acquired from Ralston. Expanded manufacturing facilities were planned in Dunkirk, New York and the St. Joseph location was later expanded for wet-food production. In Asia, it shifted from a &quot;dealer system&quot; to managing its distribution. In 2004, Nestlé Purina merged its North American and Latin America operations into a Nestlé Purina PetCare Americas division. 

Nestlé Purina Petcare grew from about 11 percent of Nestlé&#x27;s revenues in 2001, to one-third by 2005. By 2006, it was the largest market-share holder in the pet food industry with 32 per cent of the market.

===Recent history===
By 2009, Purina was one of Nestlé&#x27;s fastest-growing divisions, due to an increasing willingness by consumers to spend more money on pet care. In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand. Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned solar panel system in the state. In September 2010, Nestlé reached an agreement to acquire Waggin&#x27; Train, a producer of pet treats with $200 million in annual revenues.

In 2013, Nestlé Purina PetCare acquired the pet adoption website Petfinder. The following year it acquired Zuke&#x27;s, a producer of cat and dog treats. From 2010 to 2012, Nestlé expanded its manufacturing operations in Australia, Hungary and Germany. It also implemented the company&#x27;s largest solar panel farm at its facilities in Atlanta, Georgia. In April 2014, Nestlé Purina PetCare opened the first cat café in the US.

In February 2019, the company announced plans to spend $115 million to expand its factory in Bloomfield, Missouri, to support the demand for Tidy Cats. In November, the company invested $320 million in an old textile factory in Hartwell, Georgia.

In April 2020, Nestlé Purina PetCare acquired Lily&#x27;s Kitchen, a UK-based natural pet food brand.

In November 2020, Purina announced Nina Leigh Krueger as the new company CEO. Krueger is the first female CEO of Nestlé Purina PetCare for the Americas. Purina&#x27;s president and CEO, Nina Kruneger was named Chair of Pet Food Institute in 2023.

In October 2022, Purina announced the opening of its new facility in Rayong, Thailand. Also in October, Purina celebrated the completion of expansion at its local factory in Clinton, Iowa which would bring about other new 96 positions.

Later in November, Nestlé Purina PetCare announced its alliance with Riceland Foods to work on encouraging Riceland farm members to cultivate and grow rice with sustainable techniques starting in 2023. The same year, Purina announced its partnership with pet-care startups from Europe and North Africa to meet the demands of more sustainable solutions for the well-being of pets. Also in 2022, Purina reported the launch of its new full-range pouch packages that are designed to be recycled. The pet food company seeks to achieve 100% recyclable or reusable packaging on the global level.

In 2023, it was announced that Purina&#x27;s portfolio specifically entailed dry dog food (30%), wet dog food (4%), dry cat food (19%), wet cat food (32%) and other pet nutrition products (15%). In February 2023, Purina reported its plan to acquire Red Collar Pet Foods&#x27; pet treats factory in Miami. 

In October 2023, Purina announced the opening of two new production units at its factory in Hungary. 

In 2024, Purina PetCare invested €472 million to open a pet food factory in Mantua, Italy. It also opened a new facility in Eden. Later, in May, Purina invested $220 million to stimulate production in Mexico.

===Legal issues===
In May 2014, Nestlé Purina PetCare began a legal dispute with Blue Buffalo regarding its advertising practices. Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn, whereas Purina said independent lab tests confirmed that they do. Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter-suit less than a week later. It also alleged Purina was engaging in what it characterized as a &quot;smear campaign&quot;. The National Advertising Review Board and the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo&#x27;s advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated. Blue Buffalo said it disagreed but would obey the ruling.

In 2015, after a dog died and others got sick, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Purina alleging that the company&#x27;s Beneful brand of dog food contained propylene glycol and mycotoxins produced by mould found in grains – grain being a major ingredient in Beneful. The lawsuit was unsuccessful when the judge ruled that the plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys did not prove that the food caused the dogs&#x27; illnesses, and the dog&#x27;s death was found to have been caused by a heart tumour.

In April 2017, another lawsuit, regarding Purina&#x27;s Beggin&#x27; line of dog treats and the accusation that its advertising fooled consumers into thinking that it was full of bacon, was dropped.

===Recalls===
In 2005, Nestlé Purina Petcare voluntarily recalled all of its dry pet food produced from a plant in La Encrucijada, Venezuela after an internal investigation verified contaminants that were causing illnesses in pets. According to &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot;, in 2007 the pet food market &quot;plunged into turmoil&quot; due to the widespread discovery of contaminated ingredients. During this period, Nestle Purina voluntarily recalled some of its Alpo Prime Cuts in Gravy products in the US that contained wheat gluten from China contaminated with melamine.

In August 2013 Purina recalled some of its Purina ONE Beyond dog food, because of one bag that was found to contain salmonella. In 2012 a consumer sued Nestlé Purina PetCare when his pet died after eating Waggin&#x27; Train treats. The Food and Drug Administration received more than 900 reports from grieving pet owners that alleged the treatment was causing illness or death in their pets due to chicken products from China. The FDA had issued warnings regarding these ingredients, but lab tests repeatedly confirmed there were no contaminants. Later that year, another consumer started a petition on Change.org asking retailers to voluntarily stop carrying the product. The petition attracted 60,000 signatures. The following year, Waggin&#x27; Train and Canyon Creek dog treats were voluntarily taken off the market temporarily after the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets identified trace amounts of antibiotic residue, which is allowed in Europe and China, but not approved in the US. In early 2014, a $6.5 million settlement was reached, pending approval by the court. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the company later re-introduced the brands after &quot;revamping its manufacturing process and overhauling its supply chain&quot;.

==Products and services==
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Nestlé Purina PetCare&#x27;s pet food brands that contribute substantially to revenue include Purina, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Purina Beneful and Purina One. Some brands, such as Friskies are intended for budget shoppers, while others like Purina One and Beneful cost more and are for health or ingredient-conscious consumers. Purina One has been its fastest-growing brand.

The company introduced an appetiser cat food, Fancy Feast Appetizers, in 2009. A Purina Pro Plan line for senior dogs was introduced in 2010. It contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) for brain function and whole grains for digestion. A grain-free product, Purina ONE Beyond, was introduced in 2011. Purina Pro Plan Sport, which contains extra fat and protein and is intended for athletic dogs, was made available in 2013. In 2014, Purina introduced a product for the growing Brazilian market called Ravena, which used locally available ingredients, such as acerola and jabuticaba fruits. Purina-branded accessories, such as training pads, beds, leashes and cleaners began being sold in 2011 under the Purina PetGear name through brand licensing agreements with other manufacturers.

Purina&#x27;s significant brands and product lines include:
==Marketing and advertising==
In the mid-1970s, the Purina Cat Chow brand launched the &quot;Chow-Chow-Chow&quot; advertising campaign, variations of which would run for the next 20 years. The television commercials featured cats seemingly dancing the cha-cha-cha, through a post-production and editing trick that involved rapidly playing the film forward and backward, giving the humorous illusion of the cats dancing as they walked or ran in time with the music. The earliest such spots featured character actress Patsy Garrett, who would appear in several other Cat Chow spots as an official spokesperson for many more years.

In 2006, Nestlé Purina Petcare introduced a sponsored email application, Doggie-Mail, that could send messages online through a talking dog. In 2009, it sponsored the PawNation.com site developed by AOL, which hosted crowd-sourced pet videos, tips, Q&amp;As and other content about pet ownership. Purina also sponsored Martha Stewart&#x27;s pet tips site, Living Omnimedia. The company introduced an advertising campaign for the Alpo brand with the slogan &quot;Real dogs eat meat&quot;. In the ad, over-pampered pets were &quot;rescued&quot; and fed Alpo, implying that pets needed to stay in touch with their primal nature by eating real meat. In 2009, it released a free iPhone app called &quot;petcentric places&quot; that allows users to map local pet-related locations, like dog parks or pet-friendly hotels. In 2010, Purina released a branded Facebook game called Purina Pet Resort, where players manage a virtual pet resort.

In 2011, Nestlé Purina PetCare became the official sponsor of the Westminster show hosted by the American Kennel Club. The company introduced a competition for pet owners to win a part-time job earning $50,000 annually to travel with their cat, interview other pet owners and write for the Purina website. Nestle Purina also produced television advertisements intended for Austria that had audio effects only pets could hear. It was the first set of advertisements targeting pets directly, rather than their owners.

In 2012, Purina and another Nestlé business, Jenny Craig, jointly created &quot;Project: Pet Slim Down&quot;, an online program intended to help pets and pet owners lose weight together. Grumpy Cat became a &quot;spokescat&quot; for the Friskies brand in late 2013. In 2013, Purina featured ads during the Westminster Show that featured crowd-sourced videos submitted to Purina in response to the question &quot;How is Your Dog Great?&quot;.

<text>The GM M platform was the designation used by General Motors for the platform that underpinned the first, second and third generation Suzuki Cultus and its offspring.

The first generation of this platform had been designed by Suzuki for their 1983 Cultus, and adopted by Chevrolet with the introduction of the Sprint.

The platforms of the second and third generations first appeared in 1989 and 1995 respectively. They were designed at GM&#x27;s Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, USA. Suzuki designed all the engines, drivetrains and actual body. From 1985 through 1989, all models were imported from Suzuki&#x27;s facilities in Hamamatsu, Japan. From 1990 on, some North American M-cars were produced at CAMI Automotive in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada with the exception of the convertible and turbocharged models which were imported from Japan. The third generation M platform was only sold by Suzuki as the Suzuki Swift in North America as Suzuki decided to create their own Swift to market around the world.

The following vehicles used this platform:
Suzuki Cultus Generations I and II, GM M platform:

2= 2-dr convertible
3= 3-dr hatchback
4= 4-dr sedan
5= 5-dr hatchback
un = unknown
a. Manufactured at Magyar Suzuki
b. Imported to Colombia
c. Geo branded models in US after 1989, in Canada after 1992
d. MF, MH: only generations of &#x27;Cultus-derived&#x27; Barina
e. Justy JMA/MS, manufactured at Magyar Suzuki
f. Manufactured at Paksuzuki

Suzuki Cultus Generation III, GM M platform:

3 = 3-dr hatchback
4 = 4-dr sedan
5 = 5-dr hatchback

GM also used a different M platform for its rear-wheel drive minivans, the Chevrolet Astro and the GMC Safari.

<doc id="1118772" wikidata="Q3544222" url="?curid=1118772" title="USS Burrfish">
<text>USS &quot;Burrfish&quot; (SS/SSR-312) was a of the United States Navy named for the burrfish (&quot;Chilomycterus schoepfi&quot;), a swellfish of the Atlantic coast. The vessel entered service in 1943 and saw action during World War II and in the postwar era. In 1961 &quot;Burrfish&quot; was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy where she served as HMCS &quot;Grilse&quot; (SS 71) and was used primarily as a training boat from 1961 until 1969.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Burrfish&quot; was launched on 18 June 1943 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, sponsored by Miss Jane Elizabeth Davis, daughter of Senator James J. Davis from Pennsylvania. The boat was commissioned 14 September 1943.

&quot;Burrfish&quot;″s war operations extended from 2 February 1944 to 13 May 1945 during which period she completed six war patrols, sinking one 5,894-ton German tanker &quot;Rossbach&quot; in Japanese waters on 7 May 1944 and, along with , a 200-ton patrol boat on 17 November 1944. Her operating area extended from the Western Caroline Islands to Formosa and the waters south of Japan. During her third war patrol the ship accomplished several special missions, conducting reconnaissance of the beaches of Palau and Yap where landings were planned.

On 20 December 1944, prior to her fifth war patrol, Lieutenant Commander M. H. Lytle relieved Commander W. B. Perkins, Jr. as commanding officer of &quot;Burrfish&quot;.

&quot;Burrfish&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor from her last war patrol 13 May 1945. On 16 May she was ordered to return to the United States for major overhaul and arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 19 June. On 12 October 1945 she reported to New London, Connecticut, for inactivation and was placed out of commission in reserve on 10 October 1946.

On 2 November 1948 &quot;Burrfish&quot; was recommissioned and assigned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Her designation was changed to SSR-312 on 27 January 1949 and her conversion was completed in November 1949.

&quot;Burrfish&quot; returned to duty with the active fleet 7 February 1950 and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 at Norfolk. Between February 1950 and June 1956 she completed three tours with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea; participated in several major type and inter-type exercises; and operated along the eastern seaboard as a radar picket ship.

On 5 June 1956 &quot;Burrfish&quot; sailed from Norfolk, Virginia to New London where she reported for inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve 17 December 1956 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

=== Service with the Royal Canadian Navy ===
The Royal Canadian Navy was interested in reestablishing its submarine service in the late 1950s and as an essential stopgap to further purchases, they sought a boat to train in. The United States Navy gave them a choice from among ten boats in the Reserve Fleet and &quot;Burrfish&quot; was selected. An official agreement to loan a submarine to the Royal Canadian Navy was finalized after approval by the Canadian Cabinet and ratification by the United States Congress in May 1960. The loan agreement would last for five years and would include $1,764,000 for the cost of reactivation and modification.

In Fall 1960 the prospective crew was sent to New London, Connecticut for US submarine training. On 17 January 1961 the submarine was recommissioned into the United States Navy as SS-312. The sub was then decommissioned from the United States Navy on 11 May 1961 and recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at New London as HMCS &quot;Grilse&quot; (SS 71), the second vessel to bear the name. &quot;Grilse&quot; underwent one month of sea trials before transiting to her new homeport at Esquimalt, British Columbia, arriving on 14 July 1961.

Having reestablished the Canadian submarine service, &quot;Grilse&quot; was acquired by the Royal Canadian Navy for use as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare training on the Pacific coast. However, the boat lacked the speed of more modern subs and her sensor and weapons outfit were not up to the task of anti-submarine warfare. As a result, &quot;Grilse&quot; spent most of her time as &quot;clockwork mice&quot; for surface ships and aircraft, as a passive target for their training. The submarine participated in joint Royal Canadian Navy/Royal Canadian Air Force and joint US/Canada training exercises in the Pacific.

In May 1966, her five-year loan was renewed for $1 million, and the sub underwent a refit in 1967 for $1.2 million. In Spring 1968, &quot;Grilse&quot; was sent on a training cruise to Japan. Once there, the boat trained with units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and the United States Navy. In 1968, the Canadian Navy, now called Maritime Command, was offered a more modern by the US. Maritime Command chose to accept the offer and was purchased as a direct replacement for &quot;Grilse&quot; on the west coast.

With the arrival of &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Grilse&quot; never sailed again. Some of &quot;Grilse&quot;″s more modern gear was taken out and transferred to &quot;Rainbow&quot;, however &quot;Grilse&quot; had to remain operationally capable in accordance with the loan agreement and the transfer was limited. The sub returned to the US in September 1969.

The boat was struck from the Naval Register on 19 July 1969. &quot;Grilse&quot; was officially paid off from Maritime Command on 2 October 1969 and returned to the US Navy the same day. &quot;Burrfish&quot; was sunk as a target off San Clemente Island, California, on 19 November 1969.

=== Research ===
&quot;Grilse&quot; was also used as a test platform for measuring the nature of turbulence, the results of which were analyzed by scientists that included French polymath Benoit Mandelbrot, whose thinking on fractals was substantially shaped by this experience:
&quot;On a visit to Vancouver, I asked to listen to the recordings. Not possible, I was told; the audio tapes, while playable, spanned too broad a frequency spectrum from high pitch to low, most of them outside human earshot. But surely, I said, you can speed up and slow down the tape? I insisted. And, after some fumbling with the then-primitive equipment, they obliged me. We sat and listened. Just listened. Loud high pitch, then low rumblings. Then high pitch again; more rumblings. Change the tape speed: Same pattern. Now, most people listening to this would call it stretches of high-frequency noise interrupted by low patches. But if they had taken the trouble to study the intervals, to analyze the relative proportions of high and low patches, they would have found something else: a turbulent process that proceeds in bursts and pauses, and whose parts scale fractally. The turbulent water through which the submarine’s nose plowed in a one-dimensional line was not one long alternation of fast and slow water. Instead, seen in all three dimensions, it was a complicated pattern of churning eddies and torrents, all interrelated from start of journey to end of journey—in effect, over an infinite span of time and space.

&quot;That experience underlies all my thinking about financial markets.&quot;

– Benoit B. Mandelbrot, &quot;The (Mis)Behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence&quot;

<text>Wrangler is an American manufacturer of jeans and other clothing items, particularly workwear. The brand is owned by Kontoor Brands Inc., which also owns Lee. Its headquarters is in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina, in the United States, with production plants located throughout the world.

==History==
Wrangler Jeans were first made by the Blue Bell Overall Company, which had acquired the brand when it took over Casey Jones in the mid-1940s. Blue Bell employed Bernard Lichtenstein (&quot;Rodeo Ben&quot;), a Jewish tailor from Łódź who worked closely with cowboys, to help design jeans suitable for rodeo use. He convinced several well-known rodeo riders of the time to endorse the new design.

The 13MWZ style, short for the thirteenth version of men&#x27;s western jeans with zipper, was introduced in 1947. This model is still available and the company has since introduced several other lines that are more designated towards a specific group or demographic. Examples include 20X, Riggs, and Aura. Wrangler also exports its goods to many countries, with Europe and Australia being some of its main export markets.

===Timeline===
1897: Twenty-year-old C.C. Hudson leaves Spring Hill Farm in Williamson County, Tennessee, and makes his way to Greensboro, North Carolina, seeking his fortune in the emerging textile industry. He finds work in a factory making overalls, where he earns 25 cents a day sewing on buttons.

1904; Hudson&#x27;s workplace closes. He and a few others buy several of the sewing machines, lease space above a downtown grocery store and incorporate as the Hudson Overall Company.

1919: The business builds its first factory on South Elm Street in Greensboro and changes its name to Blue Bell Overall Company.

1936: Blue Bell launches Super Big Ben Overalls made out of 100% Sanforized Fabric that reduces shrinkage after washing to less than 1%. This sets a new standard for the industry.

1943: Blue Bell acquires the Casey Jones Work-Clothes Company and the rights to a rarely used Casey Jones brand name: Wrangler.

1946: Blue Bell starts to develop a jeans line for cowboys, hiring famous tailor &quot;Rodeo Ben&quot;. Blue Bell workers take part in a contest to give the jeans a brand name. The winning name is Wrangler, synonymous with the name for a working cowboy.

1947: After designing and testing 13 pairs of prototype jeans, Blue Bell introduces the Wrangler 11MWZ to American consumers. The Wrangler Jeans featured several innovations aimed particularly at cowboys: Felled outseams and inseams, rear pockets positioned for comfort in the saddle, &#x27;no scratch&#x27; rivet pocket reinforcement, a zipper fly, and the use of a strong tack in the crotch instead of a metal rivet. A promotional campaign is launched featuring 11MWZ test riders and rodeo legends Freckles Brown, Bill Linderman, and Jim Shoulders.

1952: Lot number 11MWZ is renamed 13MWZ to conform to the denim weight being used to manufacture the style.

1962: Blue Bell opens a factory in Belgium and the Wrangler brand name enjoys a successful launch in Europe.

1974: The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) officially endorses Wrangler Jeans.
1983: Wrangler sponsor European Football champions Nottingham Forest F.C.

1986: Blue Bell merges with the VF Corporation of Pennsylvania.

1996: One of every five pairs of jeans sold in America is a Wrangler. 

1997: The 50th anniversary of the 13MWZ. A Special Collectors Edition of the 13MWZ is created to celebrate this event.

2000: &quot;Whatever You Ride&quot; television ad campaign is launched, focusing on core brand values.

2001: Wrangler commences making its jeans in Mexico.

2002: &quot;There&#x27;s a bit of the West in all of us&quot; TV and print ad campaign is launched.

2004: A new Wrangler European print campaign is launched, &quot;Wanted,&quot; representing a modern expression of Wrangler&#x27;s roots. Wrangler also celebrates 100 years of manufacturing quality denim by producing Blue Bell by Wrangler, a limited edition collection that reproduces the first Wrangler jeans right down to the last detail. Wrangler also reworks the mainstream collection, producing new fits using icons inspired by the very first jeans designed by Rodeo Ben. The Wrangler brand is now recognized in 22 European countries.

2005: Wrangler&#x27;s last U.S. sewing plant is closed.

2011: Wrangler conducts consumer design competition to find the next thing in jeans. The winner, Song Anh Nguyen of Greensboro, had her design produced by Wrangler and made available for sale.

2018: Wrangler parent company VF Corporation announces plans to spin off its jeans operations including Wrangler into a separate public company.

2019: Wrangler, together with Lee and Rock &amp; Republic, becomes part of Kontoor Brands, an independent publicly traded spin-off from VF Corporation.

2022: Wrangler Apparel Corp. files a U.S. trademark application for the name WRANGLERVERSE for, among other services, hosting live and virtual performances, concerts, and social entertainment events and providing virtual environments in which users can interact for recreational, leisure, or entertainment purposes. The application signals an intent to expand the WRANGLER brand into the Metaverse.

==Media advertising==
===One Tough Customer===
Wrangler rose to prominence to many eyes in the early 1980s with their &quot;One Tough Customer&quot; campaign in which they sponsored most prominently NASCAR Winston Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt to became an iconic car and driver in the history of the sport. The company also sponsored other drivers such as Ricky Rudd, Jody Ridley, Bobby Hillin Jr., Steve Park, Martin Truex Jr., Ty Dillon, Ryan Blaney, and Matt DiBenedetto between 1984 and 2020. Famously Freddie Mercury wore a pair of Wrangler Jeans, whilst performing at Live Aid in 1985.

<doc id="1118777" wikidata="Q1253374" url="?curid=1118777" title="Downtown Crossing">
<text>Downtown Crossing is a shopping district within Downtown Boston, Massachusetts, located east of Boston Common, west of the Financial District, south of Government Center, and north of Chinatown and the old Combat Zone. It features large department stores as well as restaurants, souvenir sellers, general retail establishments, and street vendors. The Downtown Crossing MBTA station lies in the center of the district.

The district gets its name from the intersection of Washington Street with Winter and Summer Streets. Historically, the district was anchored by two department stores, Jordan Marsh and Filene&#x27;s which stood opposite each other at the intersection. While both stores have since been bought by other chains and no longer exist, the district continues to be a major pedestrian shopping area, with the area of Washington, Winter, and Summer streets surrounding the intersection closed to most vehicular traffic; pedestrians may walk freely in the street.

==History==

===Early history===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Summer Street was an upscale neighborhood, with townhouses designed by Charles Bulfinch and others. The Great Boston Fire of 1872 destroyed much of the neighborhood, especially between Summer, Washington, and Milk Streets.

===Ladder District===

Since the early 1900s, the area along Washington and Tremont Streets, roughly from School Street to Beach Street, has also been referred to as the Ladder District. The side streets between the two main thoroughfares look like the rungs of a ladder when viewed on a map, hence the name.

===Department stores===
Between 1895 and 1917, Downtown Crossing became the hub of department store shopping in Boston. In 1841, Eben Jordan and Benjamin L. Marsh opened the first Jordan Marsh store as wholesalers, which later grew into a retail department store. Another major store, Filene&#x27;s, was founded in 1881. Originally known as William Filene&#x27;s Sons Co. the store expanded, opening the &quot;Automatic Bargain Basement&quot; in 1909. Gilchrist and Kennedy&#x27;s also opened in the neighborhood, though both are now defunct. These stores attracted more middle-class visitors, including those from the suburbs, and anchored other retail services, including food and restaurants.

Nationwide, downtown department stores faced challenges after World War II due to suburbanization and competition from big box stores.

Filene&#x27;s Basement would go on to become a major department store independent of Filene&#x27;s. The flagship store of Filene&#x27;s Basement was located underground, in the basement of the former Filene&#x27;s department store. The two stores, formerly under the same ownership, were disassociated in 1988. The building housing the two stores was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

During the Winter Season Filene&#x27;s would hold a Christmas tree lighting and Jordan Marsh would present a series festive Christmas window displays known as the &quot;Enchanted Village&quot;. The window display has since relocated to Boston&#x27;s Hynes Convention Center, and then to City Hall Plaza.

===Redevelopment===
Following the success of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Boston decided to redevelop the Washington Street area into a pedestrian-only mall, which was unveiled in 1979. At first, foot traffic and business in the area declined, but it slowly returned as the popularity of the mall as a shopping area increased, helped along by a cart vending program.

The area is experiencing more growth due to new luxury hotel and condominium additions. In 2013, Millennium Place was completed. The luxury towers rise to 38 stories (475 feet) and 36 stories (446 feet).

In 1996, the former Jordan Marsh store became Macy&#x27;s, and in early 2006 the Filene&#x27;s landmark flagship store was closed. In 2006, Vornado Realty Trust announced the purchase of the former Filenes site for $100m. The project is expected to cost around $620 million and the project would be filled with upscale shopping destinations, high-dollar business space, and tony residences.
The plan calls for a 38-story tower that will rise to 495 feet. However, the vacancy left by Filene&#x27;s has left the building to be redeveloped. Filene&#x27;s Basement has been closed for the duration of construction, but has vowed to return upon the completion of construction.

Filene&#x27;s Basement filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday May 4, 2009. New York&#x27;s Crown Acquisitions, with the Chetrit Group as its partner has made a bid to buy 17 of Filene&#x27;s 25 locations including the Downtown Crossing location. Although construction has stalled on the Downtown Crossing project, the store is still slated to reopen in the future. The Downtown Crossing location accounted for 13% of the company&#x27;s sales. Vornado Realty Trust had been paying Filene&#x27;s $500,000 a month in compensation for closing their Downtown Crossing store. These payments stopped without notice in January 2009.

In 2010, the Downtown Boston Business Improvement District was initiated to revive an ailing Downtown Crossing. In 2015, the historic Burnham Building (see Filene&#x27;s Department Store) where Filene&#x27;s flagship previously resided became occupied by Havas and Arnold Worldwide on its upper floors. In the second half of 2015, supermarket Roche Bros. and Primark, an Irish clothing retailer, opened to occupy the ground floor of the Burnham Building.

===Suffolk University expansion===
In 2007 Suffolk University bought a building on West Street that was being renovated into condominiums, and converted it into a student dormitory capable of housing about 270 students.

In 2010, Suffolk University renovated and restored the historical Modern Theatre and built a ten-story dormitory on top of the theater. The building is now an expansion to the original 10 West Street building and houses an additional 200 students.

==Other points of interest==
A plaque on the Macy&#x27;s building marks the location of the first mint in the British colonies, established by John Hull in 1652.

The MBTA&#x27;s Downtown Crossing subway station directly serves Downtown Crossing. The State Street and Park Street stations are within close walking distance. Silver Line service is also available.

A small mall called Lafayette Place Mall was attached to the Jordan Marsh store in 1985; by 1992 the mall was closed and has since been converted to offices. The Corner Mall in the former Gilchrist&#x27;s department store building now services the public with a large food court and several small retail stores.

The Boston Irish Famine Memorial is located on the corner of School Street and Washington Street.

<doc id="1118789" wikidata="Q1520713" url="?curid=1118789" title="Linearization">
<text>In mathematics, linearization (British English: linearisation) is finding the linear approximation to a function at a given point. The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion around the point of interest. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems. This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology.

==Linearization of a function==
Linearizations of a function are lines—usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function formula_1 at any formula_2 based on the value and slope of the function at formula_3, given that formula_4 is differentiable on formula_5 (or formula_6) and that formula_7 is close to formula_8. In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near formula_2.

For example, formula_10. However, what would be a good approximation of formula_11?

For any given function formula_1, formula_4 can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that formula_14, where formula_15 is the linearization of formula_4 at formula_2. The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point formula_18 and slope formula_19. The general form of this equation is: formula_20.

Using the point formula_21, formula_15 becomes formula_23. Because differentiable functions are locally linear, the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to formula_4 at formula_2.

While the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to formula_2, those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope formula_19 should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at formula_2.
Visually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of formula_4 at formula_30. At formula_31, where formula_32 is any small positive or negative value, formula_31 is very nearly the value of the tangent line at the point formula_34.

The final equation for the linearization of a function at formula_2 is:
formula_36

For formula_2, formula_38. The derivative of formula_4 is formula_40, and the slope of formula_4 at formula_7 is formula_43.

===Example===
To find formula_44, we can use the fact that formula_10. The linearization of formula_46 at formula_2 is formula_48, because the function formula_49 defines the slope of the function formula_46 at formula_30. Substituting in formula_52, the linearization at 4 is formula_53. In this case formula_54, so formula_44 is approximately formula_56. The true value is close to 2.00024998, so the linearization approximation has a relative error of less than 1 millionth of a percent.

==Linearization of a multivariable function==
The equation for the linearization of a function formula_57 at a point formula_58 is:

:formula_59

The general equation for the linearization of a multivariable function formula_60 at a point formula_61 is:

:formula_62

where formula_63 is the vector of variables, formula_64 is the gradient, and formula_61 is the linearization point of interest

==Uses of linearization==

Linearization makes it possible to use tools for studying linear systems to analyze the behavior of a nonlinear function near a given point. The linearization of a function is the first order term of its Taylor expansion around the point of interest. For a system defined by the equation

:formula_66,

the linearized system can be written as

:formula_67

where formula_68 is the point of interest and formula_69 is the formula_63-Jacobian of formula_71 evaluated at formula_68.

===Stability analysis===
In stability analysis of autonomous systems, one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of the linearization theorem. For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification.

===Microeconomics===
In microeconomics, decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization. Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state. A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found.

===Optimization===
In mathematical optimization, cost functions and non-linear components within can be linearized in order to apply a linear solving method such as the Simplex algorithm. The optimized result is reached much more efficiently and is deterministic as a global optimum.

===Multiphysics===
In multiphysics systems—systems involving multiple physical fields that interact with one another—linearization with respect to each of the physical fields may be performed. This linearization of the system with respect to each of the fields results in a linearized monolithic equation system that can be solved using monolithic iterative solution procedures such as the Newton–Raphson method. Examples of this include MRI scanner systems which results in a system of electromagnetic, mechanical and acoustic fields.

<text>The Jowett Javelin was an executive car produced from 1947 to 1953 by Jowett Cars Ltd of Idle, near Bradford in England. The model went through five variants coded PA to PE. The designation changed to coincide with the London Motor Show in November but actually engineering design changes occurred frequently during the total production run, as and when required. The car was designed by Gerald Palmer during World War II and was intended to be a major leap forward from the relatively staid designs of pre-war Jowetts. Just over 23,000 units were produced.

==Introduction==
The new Javelin, not yet in full production, made its first public appearance on Saturday 27 July 1946 in a cavalcade to celebrate 60 years of the British Motor Industry organised by the SMMT. Started by the King in Regent&#x27;s Park the cavalcade passed through Marble Arch around London&#x27;s West End and Piccadilly Circus and back up to Regent&#x27;s Park. Series production was not fully under way until November 1947.

In a 1949 road test report &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; correspondent welcomed the Javelin&#x27;s good performance and original design. The engine mounted ahead of the front axle briskly accelerates (to nearly 80 mph) a body which could carry six persons. The moderate size of the engine, the car&#x27;s light weight and good streamlining all contribute to its excellent performance. Controls were all light to operate and it was a restful car to drive.

==Powertrain==
The flat four overhead valve engine of 1486 cc with a compression ratio of 7.2:1 was water-cooled and had an aluminium block and wet cylinder liners. It developed at 4100 rpm (52.5 bhp in the case of the PE) giving the car a maximum speed of and a 0- time of 13.4 seconds. Two Zenith carburettors were fitted and PA and PB versions had hydraulic tappets. The radiator was behind the engine. A four-speed gearbox with column change was used. Early cars had gearboxes made by the Henry Meadows company. Later, Jowett made the gearboxes, but the decision to make the gearboxes in-house proved to be a costly mistake. Even though Jowett had some experience in transmission manufacturing, the project went disastrously wrong; powertrainless bodies stacked up in the assembly line because of problems in gearbox production.


==Design features==
Design features included aerodynamic styling with the headlights faired into the wings and, for the time, a steeply sloped, curved windscreen, a first for a British production car. The body was of pressed steel, incorporating a box-section chassis, and was made for Jowett by Briggs Motor Bodies in their Doncaster factory. The suspension used torsion-bars on all wheels (independent at the front) and internal gear-and-pinion steering. PA and PB models had mixed Girling hydraulic brakes at the front and mechanical braking at the rear. Later versions were fully hydraulic. The PA was available in only one version although cloth or leather seats were an option. The PB was available with a &quot;de luxe&quot; option with leather seats and walnut dashboard among other improvements. The &quot;standard&quot; car was simplified, retaining the metal dashboard from the PA series and basic vinyl seats were introduced. The two-tier model range was continued until the end of production.

==Gallery==
==Dimensions==
The car had a wheelbase of and a track of . Overall the car was long, wide and weighed about 1 tonne depending on model and year. The car was expensive, costing £819 at launch. The Jowett was competing against cars such as the Jaguar 1½ litre (£953), Lanchester LD10 (£927), Riley RM 1½ litre (£863) and the Singer Super 12 (£768).

==Performance==

A de-luxe saloon version tested by The Motor magazine in 1953 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 20.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1207 including taxes.

==Sporting achievements==
An early example won in its class at the 1949 Monte Carlo Rally, and another won the 2-litre touring-car class at the Spa 24-hour race in the same year. In the 1952 International RAC Rally a Javelin again won its class and also took the &quot;Best Closed Car&quot; award. A privately entered Javelin won the 1953 International Tulip Rally outright.

<text>&quot;Barwick Green&quot; is the theme music to the long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;. A &quot;maypole dance&quot; from the suite &quot;My Native Heath&quot; written in 1924 by the Yorkshire composer Arthur Wood, it is named after Barwick-in-Elmet in Yorkshire&#x27;s West Riding.

The recording used between 1950 and the 1990s was played by Sidney Torch and his orchestra. Sidney Torch recorded a commercial version of &quot;Barwick Green&quot; in the 1950s, but it was not used on &quot;The Archers&quot; itself.

The familiar opening 7 notes are echoed in the pizzicato in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Simple Symphony&quot;, written in 1934.

The Sunday omnibus broadcast of &quot;The Archers&quot; starts with a more rustic, accordion-arranged rendition by The Yetties, while BBC Radio 4 Extra&#x27;s former spinoff, &quot;Ambridge Extra&quot;, used a version arranged by Bellowhead.

<text>Crocodile Dundee II is a 1988 action comedy film and the second of the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; film series. It is a sequel to &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986) and was followed by &quot;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&quot; (2001). Actors Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski reprise their roles as Mick Dundee and Sue Charlton, respectively, here shown opposing a Colombian drug cartel.

The film was directed by John Cornell and shot on location in New York City and Northern Territory, Australia. It cost $14 million to make.

==Plot==
Two years from the first film Mick Dundee and Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Charlton are living happily together in New York. Although Mick&#x27;s ignorance of city life is a hazard when he attempts to continue his former lifestyle, like blast fishing in Manhattan&#x27;s waters, Sue&#x27;s writing has made him a popular public figure. He goes to work for Leroy Brown, a mild-mannered stationery salesman trying to live up to his self-conceived &#x27;bad guy in the streets&#x27; image.

While working for the DEA in Colombia, Sue&#x27;s ex-husband Bob takes photographs of a drug cartel leader&#x27;s murder of an unknown person, and is spotted by one of the cartel&#x27;s sentries. He sends the photographs to Sue before being murdered. Colombian cartel leader Luis Rico and his brother and top lieutenant, Miguel, go to New York City to retrieve the photos.

The gangsters take Sue hostage, leading Mick to ask Leroy for help. Leroy contacts a local street gang, whom Mick asks to create a distraction by caterwauling at the mansion&#x27;s perimeter, leading most of the cartel&#x27;s guards on a wild goose chase while Mick rescues Sue. Rico goes into hiding to avoid arrest, and after his henchmen fail a subsequent attempt to kill Sue, Mick decides to take Sue to Australia to protect themselves on familiar ground. In Walkabout Creek, Mick is enthusiastically welcomed back by friends. After getting provisions, he and Sue take refuge on his personal land, named Belonga Mick. Here, Sue discovers that Mick legally owns a large plot of land, including a gold mine.

Rico and his men track them to Australia, where they hire some locals to assist, but their Aboriginal tracker promptly abandons the group upon learning that their quarry is Mick. The gangsters then take Mick&#x27;s friend Walter as a hostage, but Mick saves him by narrowly missing an aimed rifle shot at Walter&#x27;s head.

Walter convinces the gangsters that Mick&#x27;s failed attack was because he is the only person suitable to guide them, so they take him as a replacement tracker. He then leads the gangsters on a false trail through the Outback, during which Mick, with the help of his Aboriginal friends he summoned with a bullroarer, reduces the opposition&#x27;s numbers one by one, leaving the rest increasingly nervous. Mick retrieves Walter from Rico and Miguel, leaving the latter to face him alone.

Rico sets a bushfire in a ploy to corner Mick, but Mick regains the upper hand, captures Rico, and switches clothes with him to lure Miguel into a vulnerable position. Sue, Walter, and Miguel begin shooting at the pair from a distance, mistaking their targets for each other. Walter and Miguel shoot Mick and Rico, respectively, and Rico falls down an escarpment to his death. Sue shoots and kills Miguel, after which they learn of the clothing switch from one of the aborigines. Sue is relieved to find that Walter&#x27;s shot has only wounded Mick, and the two embrace. He asks her if she is ready to go home, to which she joyfully replies, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; home.&quot;

==Release==

The film opened 25 May 1988 in the United States and Canada on a record 2,837 screens. In 1987, during the film&#x27;s production, Paramount outbid the international unit of 20th Century-Fox for the worldwide rights to the film&#x27;s sequel.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; was also a worldwide hit, but not as big as its predecessor.

The film set an opening weekend record in Australia with a gross of A$2,005,536 and went on to gross $24,916,805 in Australia, which is equivalent to $59,890,392 in 2022 dollars. It was the second highest-grossing Australian film in Australia behind the original.

The film was released theatrically in the United States by Paramount Pictures in May 1988. For its first six days of American release, its box office receipts of US$29.2 million exceeded those of &quot;Rambo III&quot; at $21.2 million. It grossed $109,306,210 at the box office in the United States and Canada. It was the second highest-grossing film that year for Paramount (second only to &quot;Coming to America&quot;) and the sixth highest-grossing film at the United States box office. It also had the biggest opening ever in the United Kingdom with an opening week gross of £2,797,164, including a record opening week gross for a European cinema of £169,139 at the Odeon Leicester Square.

===Critical response===
Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed the sequel to be inferior, noting &quot;the novelty has begun to wear thin, even if Mr. Hogan remains generally irresistible&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a disappointing follow-up to the disarmingly charming first feature with Aussie star Paul Hogan. [This] sequel is too slow to constitute an adventure and has too few laughs to be a comedy – resulting in a mildly entertaining 111 minutes that has much less of the freshness and spark that legions of filmgoers loved in the original&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that it &quot;has too much action initially, losing its trademark, gentle touch for the first half of the movie. The film is much more compelling in its concluding scenes in the Australian outback than in its comedy-action scenes in New York City that open the film. The result is that we leave the theater with a bit of a smile, but just a bit. It&#x27;s not a steady, complete film.&quot; On &quot;At the Movies&quot;, Siskel&#x27;s co-reviewer Roger Ebert said the film deserves credit for retaining the imagination of the original, in that Dundee continues to defeat adversaries using his wits and survival knowledge rather than turning into a &quot;violent superman&quot; as many action heroes do in sequels, but he nonetheless joined Siskel in giving it &quot;two thumbs down&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was generally positive, calling it &quot;almost as much fun the second time around. As an adventure, it&#x27;s nothing special, yet it&#x27;s an inspired and good-humored presentation of one of the freshest, most likable screen personalities to emerge in the past decade.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;about as laid-back a movie as you&#x27;re ever likely to nap through. The actors take forever to recite their lines, and scenes unfold as if the filmmakers had rented the screen by the month.&quot; Hinson added that Cornell &quot;seems not to have understood that for Dundee&#x27;s heroic laconicism to work, the world around him has to have some energy, it&#x27;s got to move. But Cornell doesn&#x27;t know how to create pace or movement. He directs as if he were swinging in a hammock.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 9% from 32 reviews, with an average rating of 3.60/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Retelling its predecessor&#x27;s same joke with diminishing returns, &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; sees the franchise&#x27;s enjoyability go down under.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 41% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, the same grade as its predecessor.

Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed this film at Camp David on June 10, 1988.

==Sequel==
A sequel titled &quot;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&quot; was released in 2001.
