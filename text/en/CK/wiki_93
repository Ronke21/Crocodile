<text>The rackett, raggett, cervelas, or sausage bassoon is a Renaissance-era double reed wind instrument, introduced late in the sixteenth century and already superseded by bassoons at the end of the seventeenth century.

== Description ==
There are four sizes of rackett, in a family ranging from descant (soprano), tenor-alto, bass to great bass. Relative to their pitch, racketts are quite small (the descant rackett is only 4½ inches long, yet its lowest note is G2). This is achieved through its ingenious construction; the body consists of a solid wooden cylinder into which nine parallel bores are drilled. These are connected alternately at the top and bottom, resulting in a long, cylindrical wind passage within a compact body so that one can carry in one&#x27;s pocket an instrument that will descend as low in pitch as a modern bassoon.

However, its unusual construction requires its fingering to be somewhat different from other period woodwinds; it is similar to the front seven holes of the crumhorn and blends well with recorders and krumhorns, but with the hands placed side by side. Additional holes are covered by the thumbs and second joint of the index finger in order to extend the range a perfect fourth below the nominal scale, like the curtal. Thus the descant rackett is considered to be in C, but its range covers a perfect twelfth from d&#x27; to G. The ranges for the rest of the family as given by Praetorius are: tenor alt: g to C; bass: c to FF; great bass: A to DD or G to CC. The range could be extended upward by several more notes since the Renaissance rackett overblows at the twelfth like a clarinet. Praetorius writes in &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot; II: &quot;if a rackett is well drilled and is played by a good musician, it then can be made to produce a few more tones.&quot; The three extant renaissance racketts are housed in two European collections; one is in the &quot;Musikinstrumenten Museum&quot; in Leipzig, and two are in the &quot;Kunsthistorisches Museum&quot; in Vienna.

Renaissance racketts surround the reed with an openwork cylindrical pirouette; Baroque ones are closed-in, with a bocal.

The baroque rackett (developed by the Nuremberg maker Johann Christoph Denner) combined the folded bore concept with a conical (or pseudo-conical) bore profile; in essence, it is a bassoon in rackett form. It has ten parallel cylindrical bores whose diameters increase in succession to function as a true conical bore and allow overblowing at the octave. A number of &quot;tetines&quot; were added, which are tubular metal extensions covered by the middle joint of the index fingers as well as the pinkies. Condensation usually remains in the coil of the removable brass crook, thus it is fairly simple to expel during pauses. Despite its idiosyncrasies, the baroque rackett is a versatile instrument with a wide range of notes and dynamics. With an appropriate reed, the baroque rackett has a similar chromatic range to the baroque bassoon (g&#x27; to BB), and with its agility, can perform most bass-instrument repertoire from the time in which it was in vogue. Extant specimens of the baroque rackett can be found in the &quot;Musikinstrumenten-Museum Berlin&quot;, the &quot;Rijksmuseum&quot; in Amsterdam and the &quot;Bayerisches Nationalmuseum&quot; in Munich.

== Origin ==
The inventor of the rackett is unknown. The first historical mention can be found in German sources Wurttemberg inventories of 1576 (listed as a &quot;Raggett&quot;) and the Graz inventory of 1590 (listed as &quot;Rogetten&quot;). Early paintings of the Munich Court band and a carved cabinet by Christof Angermair depict a single rackett being played in a mixed consort of other instruments. Prior to the late seventeenth century, the rackett had a cylindrical bore and the reed was surrounded by a pirouette. The later baroque rackett had an expanding pseudo-conical bore and was blown through a coiled crook inserted into the top of the instrument. A separate bell joint is added to extend the sounding length.

== Sound ==
Praetorius noted: &quot;In sound Renaissance] racketts are quite soft, almost as if one were blowing through a comb. They have no particular distinction when a whole set of them is used together, but when violas da gamba are used with them, or when a single rackett is used together with other wind or stringed instruments and a harpsichord or the like, and is played by a good musician, it is indeed a lovely instrument. It is particularly pleasing and fine to hear on bass parts.&quot;

The tone is versatile, with good dynamic and tonal range, and has a warm, rich, vibrating sound. The timbre has been described as &quot;combination of a bassoon and a kazoo&quot;.

The baroque rackett, sometimes called a &quot;pocket bassoon&quot; or &quot;sausage bassoon&quot;, conversely, sounds much like a dulcian or baroque bassoon, and can easily blend with the same kind of ensemble instruments—violas da gamba, cornetti, historical keyboards, baroque recorders, and small baroque orchestras.

<text>The Phoenix and the Turtle (also spelled The Phœnix and the Turtle) is an allegorical poem by William Shakespeare, first published in 1601 as a supplement to a longer work, &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;, by Robert Chester. The poem, which has been called &quot;the first great published metaphysical poem&quot;, has many conflicting interpretations. The title &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot; is a conventional label. As published, the poem was untitled. The title names two birds: the mythological phoenix and the turtle dove. 

The 67-line poem describes a funeral arranged for the deceased Phoenix and Turtledove, to which some birds are invited, but others excluded. The Phoenix and Turtledove are emblems of perfection and of devoted love, respectively. The traditional attribute of the Phoenix is that when it dies, it returns to life, rising from the ashes of its prior incarnation; the Turtledove, by contrast, is mortal. The poem states that the love of the birds created a perfect unity which transcended all logic and material fact. It concludes with a prayer for the dead lovers.

==Publication==
&quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot; was first published in 1601, as part of a collection of poems by different authors, including John Marston, George Chapman, and Ben Jonson, which was appended as a supplement to &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;, a long poem by Robert Chester printed by Richard Field for the London bookseller Edward Blount. The unused sheets of the first quarto were subsequently acquired by another publisher, Matthew Lownes, and reissued in 1611 under a different title, &quot;The Annuals of Great Britain&quot;. The poem did not appear in print again until 1640, when it was included in John Benson&#x27;s collected edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s poems, &quot;Poems Written by Wil. Shake-speare, Gent.&quot;

==Context==
The title page of the original edition of Chester&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot; explains its content:
&quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr: or Rosalins Complaint. Allegorically shadowing the truth of Loue, in the constant Fate of the Phoenix and Turtle. A Poeme enterlaced with much varietie and raritie; now first translated out of the venerable Italian Torquato Caeliano, by Robert Chester. With the true legend of famous King Arthur the last of the nine Worthies, being the first Essay of a new Brytish Poet: collected out of diuerse Authenticall Records. To these are added some new compositions of seuerall moderne Writers whose names are subscribed to their seuerall workes, vpon the first subiect viz. the Phoenix and Turtle.&quot;
Chester prefaced his poem with a short dedication addressed to the Phoenix and Turtledove. The Phoenix is envisaged as female and the dove as male:

:Phoenix of beautie, beauteous, Bird of any
:To thee I do entitle all my labour,
:More precious in mine eye by far then many
:That feedst all earthly sences with thy savour:
:Accept my home-writ praises of thy love,
:And kind acceptance of thy Turtle-dove

Chester&#x27;s main poem is a long allegory in which the relationship between the birds is explored, and its symbolism articulated. It incorporates the story of King Arthur, and a history of ancient Britain, emphasising Welsh etymologies for British towns. It culminates with the joint immolation of the Phoenix and Turtledove, giving birth to a new and more beautiful bird from the ashes. It also includes several allegorical love poems within it, supposed to have been written by the Turtledove to the Phoenix.

It is followed by a brief collection of &quot;Diverse Poeticall Essaies&quot; by the &quot;best and chiefest of our moderne writers, with their names sub-scribed to their particular workes&quot;. These include, in addition to Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, George Chapman, John Marston and the anonymous &quot;Vatum Chorus&quot; and &quot;Ignoto&quot;. All the poems use the same imagery. The series is introduced by Vatum Chorus and Ignoto, followed by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot;, which ends with mourning for the death of the perfect lovers, &quot;leaving no posterity&quot;. Marston then seems to reply to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;moving epicedium&quot;, by referring to the couple&#x27;s &quot;glorious issue&quot;: the being born from the flames. Chapman adds more detail on the relationship, saying that the Phoenix provided every variety of life to the Turtle, &quot;She was to him the Analysed World of pleasure, / Her firmness cloth&#x27;d him in variety&quot;. Jonson ends with an idealisation of the Phoenix, whose judgment shines as &quot;Clear as a naked Vestal, / Closed in an orb of Crystal.&quot;

== Interpretations ==

&quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot; is interpreted as an allegory of an ideal marriage. In addition the poem can be seen as an elucidation of the relationship between truth and beauty, or of fulfilled love, in the context of Renaissance Neoplatonism. 

The concept of a symbolic perfect love between two very different beings, one immortal and one mortal, may be associated with the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as suggested in the lines &quot;So they lov&#x27;d, as love in twain/ Had the essence but in one;/Two distincts, division none.&quot; The poem also suggests the confluence of three other lines of medieval Catholic tradition: the literary traditions of mystical union, spiritual friendship, and spiritual marriage. Shakespeare introduces a number of other birds, drawing on earlier literature about the &quot;parliament of birds&quot;, to portray the death of the lovers as the loss of an ideal that can only be lamented.

Several attempts have been made to link the lovers of the poem to historical individuals, though others have argued that the poem should not be interpreted with &quot;appliqué literalism&quot;, in the words of James P. Bednarz. Exponents of the New Criticism such as I. A. Richards and William Empson emphasised the unresolvable nature of the text&#x27;s ambiguities. Helen Hackett argues that the poem &quot;incites deciphering, but at the same time firmly rebuffs it.&quot; Some of the more prominent attempted decodings of the allegory with reference to real individuals are listed below:

===John and Ursula Salusbury===
Because Chester dedicated the main poem to the Welsh statesman Sir John Salusbury and his wife Ursula Stanley, it has been argued that all the poems in the collection, including Shakespeare&#x27;s, also celebrate the couple. Salusbury was a courtier at the court of Elizabeth I, and was a member of the powerful Salusbury Family of Wales. His wife Ursula was the illegitimate daughter of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby. A difficulty with this view is the fact that the couple are known to have had ten children, but the poem refers to the relationship as a childless &quot;married chastity&quot;. This is commented on elsewhere in the collection by John Marston, and all the poems in the collection emphasise the chaste and spiritual nature of the relationship, the couple&#x27;s only child being the mysterious being born from their bodily deaths. The identification of the Salusburys as the subject was first argued in detail by Carleton Brown in 1913. Brown tried to resolve the problem by arguing that it was written after the birth of the couple&#x27;s first child, but not published until many years later. Later writers have sometimes argued that while Chester&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot; may be intended to celebrate the couple, Shakespeare&#x27;s own poem does not. John Klause suggests that the &quot;death&quot; implied in Chester&#x27;s work is symbolic of marriage and &quot;sexual surrender&quot;, but in Shakespeare&#x27;s poem death is literal. G. Wilson Knight suggested that the poem celebrates chaste love because it is about Salusbury&#x27;s devotion to his sister, for whom Salusbury himself had written a poem.

===Queen Elizabeth===
An alternative is to interpret the Turtle as John Salusbury and the Phoenix as Queen Elizabeth I, which would explain the chastity of the relationship and the implication that their &quot;child&quot; is something mystical rather than physical. Elizabeth was often connected to the phoenix, and she is referred to as the &quot;maiden phoenix&quot; in the play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, partly written by Shakespeare (though the &quot;maiden phoenix&quot; passage is typically attributed to John Fletcher). Two panel portraits attributed to Nicholas Hilliard are known as the &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Pelican&quot; portraits because of jewels the queen wears: her personal badges of the pelican and the phoenix. Both birds appear in Chester&#x27;s main poem. An objection is that the intimacy between the lovers seems rather too strong for Salusbury and the queen.

Katherine Duncan-Jones and Henry Woudhuysen adopt a variation of the view that the poem refers to Salusbury and the queen, arguing that the &quot;session&quot; mentioned in the poem is the 1601 parliament, in which Elizabeth made a famous speech about the symbolic relationship between herself and her people, sometimes referred to as her . They draw on the earlier work of Marie Axton, who argued that Elizabeth herself is both birds, in her monarchical and human aspects, but that the human aspect (the Turtle) also includes the body of the people as a whole. Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen suggest that Salusbury represents the people.

Some scholars interpret the child of the phoenix as a reference to Elizabeth&#x27;s heir, James VI of Scotland. This imagery was used in 1604, when James arrived in London, but this would have been problematic in 1601, when Elizabeth was still alive.

The theory that both Chester&#x27;s and Shakespeare&#x27;s poems were intended to refer to the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex was first proposed by A.B. Grosart in 1878, and was revived by William Matchett in 1965. Many authors who reject the identification of the lovers as Essex and Elizabeth nevertheless argue that the events of Essex&#x27;s rebellion and execution in early 1601 may lie behind some of the more obscure symbolism in the poem and the others in the collection. Sir John Salusbury had been knighted for helping to suppress the rebellion, while his cousin Owen Salusbury was killed while participating in it. Sir John&#x27;s brother, Thomas Salusbury, had been executed after the earlier Babington Plot against Elizabeth. Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen argue that Salusbury was &quot;love&#x27;s martyr&quot; for putting devotion to his queen above his family. Peter Ackroyd and James P. Bednarz both argue that Shakespeare may have written the poem to dissociate himself from Essex, with whom he was implicated because of his links to Essex&#x27;s main ally the Earl of Southampton, and because his play about the overthrow of a monarch, &quot;Richard II&quot;, had been performed at the request of the rebels. For Bednarz &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s name, subscribed to his poem in &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot; shows his accommodation to the political order without endorsing any specific political position.&quot;

===Catholic martyrs===
Another interpretation, first proffered in the 1930s by Clara Longworth in the novel &quot;My Shakespeare, Rise!&quot; is that the poem is a cryptic Roman Catholic eulogy and is part of the contention that Shakespeare was a secret Catholic sympathiser. The advocacy of prayers for the dead (&quot;these dead birds&quot;) in the final line of the poem corroborates this interpretation. Several critics, including Clare Asquith and David Beauregard, have noted that the poem ostensibly references Catholic liturgy and possibly the writings of the Catholic priest and poet Rev. Robert Southwell, SJ, who translated the Latin hymn &quot;Lauda Sion&quot; and also authored a poem praising the married chastity of Saint Mary and Saint Joseph. John Klause argued that the poem has various parallels to the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; of the Liturgy for the Dead, but suggests that its Catholic imagery satirises conventional Protestant attitudes expressed in Chester&#x27;s poem, and that it is a subtle protest against the lauding of Sir John Salusbury, whose imagined death he supposes the poem celebrates.

Proponents of the Catholic interpretation have suggested various identities for the poem&#x27;s birds, but the interpretation that has the most traction is that the phoenix commemorates St. Anne Line, a Roman Catholic executed at Tyburn in 1601 and subsequently canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr. St. Anne Line and her young husband Roger were separated when he was imprisoned and then exiled after being arrested at a prohibited Catholic Mass. He died on the European continent a few years later and St. Anne began working for the Jesuits in London. She was arrested at a Candlemas liturgy and convicted of harbouring a Catholic priest, which led to her execution. Her body was retrieved from the common grave in the road and one of the Jesuits who knew her hinted that a secret requiem Mass was later offered for her. It was suggested that this requiem Mass provided the setting for Shakespeare&#x27;s poem. The identification was corroborated by the belief that, like Shakespeare&#x27;s couple, the Lines had no children. However, it has been proven since that they had a son named &quot;John&quot;, whom relatives adopted.

Clara Longworth first suggested that St. Anne Line is Shakespeare&#x27;s phoenix and Mark Barkworth, a Catholic priest who reportedly embraced her body as it hung on the scaffold before he was also executed, is the turtle. John Finnis and Patrick Martin argued more recently that St. Anne Line is the phoenix and her husband Roger is the turtle. They concur with Clare Asquith that the &quot;bird of loudest lay&quot; represents the composer William Byrd, who was a Roman Catholic convert, and that the crow is the Catholic priest Rev. Henry Garnet, SJ. Martin Dodwell argued further that Shakespeare used St. Anne and Roger Line to symbolise the Catholic Church itself, as disinherited and rejected by England.

<text>Moore Park is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of Toronto&#x27;s most affluent neighbourhoods. Toronto Life ranked the Rosedale-Moore Park neighbourhood as the best neighbourhood to live in Toronto. It lies along both sides of St. Clair Avenue East between the Vale of Avoca ravine and Moore Park ravine (formerly Spring Valley ravine). The northern boundary is Mount Pleasant Cemetery and the southern the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks.

The neighbourhood takes its name from its developer, John T. Moore. To encourage buyers, he built two bridges in 1891: the original steel bridge on St. Clair over the Vale of Avoca, and the original wooden bridge on Moore Avenue over Spring Valley ravine. He also helped establish railway service to the neighbourhood, overseeing the connection of the area to the Toronto Belt Line Railway, a commuter railway. The development was marketed to the wealthy, and the neighbourhood remains wealthy. Moore Park was annexed by the City of Toronto on December 16, 1912.

Census tract 0125.00 of the 2021 Canadian census covers Moore Park. Average income is , one of the highest incomes of all Toronto neighbourhoods. The neighbourhood’s average income is comparable, if not higher than parts of neighbouring Rosedale.

<doc id="1147451" wikidata="Q366134" url="?curid=1147451" title="Chest (furniture)">
<text>A chest (also called a coffer or kist) is a type of furniture typically having a rectangular structure with four walls and a removable or hinged lid, primarily used for storage, usually of personal items. The interior space may be subdivided into compartments or sections to organize its contents more effectively.
== History ==

The Ancient Egyptians created the first known chests, using wood or woven reeds, circa 3000 BC.

The early uses of an antique chest or coffer included storage of fine cloth, weapons, foods and valuable items.

In Medieval and early Renaissance times in Europe, low chests were often used as benches while taller chests were used as side tables. By placing a chest on the side on any kind of rough table, the inner surface of its lid could be used as a proper writing surface while the interior could house writing implements and related materials, as was the case with the Bargueño desk of Spain. Many early portable desks were stacked chests, with the top one having its lid on the side, to serve as a writing surface when opened.

Many European chests did use the standard band of iron over the lid and the body of the chest to close it or lock it. There were a few different styles of the chest like square box or domed lid chests, which were so different that there was no effective way to categorize them. The lid shape of domed chests, such as those in the 15th to 16th centuries, would have thrown off water and discouraged their use as seats and thus contributed to longer survival.

==Description ==
A chest is a (usually rectangular) box with a removable or hinged lid that can safeguard personal items. Some chests are equipped with locking mechanisms or a metal band that a lock can be secured on. According to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1988), a chest is &quot;a box with a lid and often, a lock, for storing or shipping things&quot; or as &quot;a cabinet as for holding medical supplies, toiletries, etc.&quot;.

Chests designed for linens or other soft objects would have a very smooth or sanded interior, and chests made for heavy equipment or weapons would have a coarser interior.

Chests were used primarily as a storage unit in the past, whereas today they are also used as decorative furniture or for seating.

==Types and terminology==

Other words for a chest include:
* coffer, a term used from Medieval times onwards for a storage box, often with a rounded top and covered with leather, and now often implying a use for storing money or other valuable objects
* kist, a word that dates back to 14th century Scotland, derived from Old Norse &quot;kista&quot;, whereas &quot;chest&quot; derives from Old English &quot;cest&quot;

A cassone is a kind of carved or painted chest associated with late Medieval and Renaissance Italy. Cassones, also called marriage chests or hope chests, were often used to carry the dowry goods in a marriage ceremony.

A simple chest, called a wakis (&quot;wagon-kist&quot;) was commonly used in the Dutch Cape Colony (now part of South Africa) as a seat on a wagon. To make it more usable, it often had a wooden support along the centre of the top so that the seated driver would not slide off so easily. In addition to this use, they were also used for storage at home; keeping clothes, food and other commodities safe. They were frequently made with one or more sides sloping downwards, although the top was always horizontal. Many are made of sturdy woods such as yellowwood and therefore last a long time. Some manufacturers also painted the front of the kist with relatively simply designs reminiscent of, and presumably originating from Europe.

In some Slavic countries, for example, in Ukraine and Serbia, chests were a family relic, especially in peasant families. Each Ukrainian girl received her own chest at the age of 15 for her future bride&#x27;s dowry. Peeping in the girl&#x27;s chest was considered impolite. Coffers were an indicator of a family&#x27;s wealth. Ukrainian girls and women also used them to keep their garments and some personal items – towels, jewelry, tools for embroidering etc. A big collection of Ukrainian traditional chests dated by the 18–20th cc. is kept in the Radomysl Castle (Zhytomyr Region, Ukraine).

In many Arab countries, chests are used to hold ship captain&#x27;s personal possessions, such as the Kuwaiti chest. Today, many Middle Eastern furniture chests are known by place names, such as Omani or Bahraini, but this most often refers to where they were purchased rather than where they were made. Others are used to hold linens and household goods collected by girls in preparation for their eventual marriage, and often called a hope chest. In Arabic, two terms are used for the dowry chest: The muqaddimah was specifically for the bride&#x27;s personal possessions; and the &quot;sunduq&quot;, which normally came in matching pairs, were for other goods.
In fantasy, fables, and games, treasure chests are frequently used as a plot device to contain treasure such as gold or jewels.

A toy chest is a type of chest that usually carries children&#x27;s toys, such as dolls or building blocks.

==In popular fiction ==

In the &quot;Discworld&quot; series by Terry Pratchett, a sentient chest on legs called The Luggage is owned by the first tourist, Twoflower.

<text>Admiral Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov (; – ) was an Imperial Russian Navy officer best known for his service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He won every engagement he participated in as the admiral of the Russian fleet.

== Life and naval career ==
Ushakov was born in the village of Burnakovo in the Yaroslavl province, Moscow Gubernia, to a modest family of the minor nobility. His father, Fyodor Ignatyevich Ushakov, was a retired sergeant of the Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Russian Imperial guards. By the time Fyodor Ushakov submitted his statement of background (&quot;skaska&quot;) to the military, his family had not been officially confirmed in the so-called &#x27;dvoryanstvo&#x27;, yet they surely belonged to serving gentry. In the submission Ushakov stated that he neither had a coat-of-arms, nor a royal patent for a landed estate, and had no way to prove nobility. In 1798, Ushakov, as a vice-admiral of the Black Sea Fleet, submitted a request for official nobility and an arms providing a genealogical record. In 1807 his coat-of-arms was added to the General all-Russian book heraldry. In 1815 Fyodor Ushakov and his family were added to the part 6 (ancient nobility) of the Yaroslavl genealogical book. 

On 15 February 1761, he signed up for the Imperial Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg. After training, he served on a galley in the Baltic Fleet. In 1768 he was transferred to the Don Flotilla (Azov Flotilla) in Taganrog, and served in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74). He commanded Catherine II&#x27;s own yacht, and was active in protecting Russian merchant ships in the Mediterranean during the First League of Armed Neutrality.

After the Russian Empire conquered the Crimean Khanate in 1783, Ushakov personally supervised the construction of a naval base in Sevastopol and the building of docks in Kherson. During the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), he defeated the Ottomans at Fidonisi under Marko Voinovich&#x27;s leadership (1788), the Kerch Strait (1790), Tendra (1790), and Cape Kaliakra (1791). In these battles, he demonstrated the ingenuity of his innovative doctrines in the art of naval warfare.

In 1798 Ushakov was promoted to full admiral and given command of a squadron which sailed to the Mediterranean via Constantinople, where it joined with a Ottoman squadron. The combined Russian-Ottoman fleet then operated under Ushakov&#x27;s command in the War of the Second Coalition against the French Republic. The expedition started by conquering the Ionian islands, acquired by France the year before from the defunct Republic of Venice in the Treaty of Campo Formio. This action culminated in the Siege of Corfu (1798–1799), and led to the subsequent creation of the Septinsular Republic. In establishing this republic, Ushakov proved himself to be a skilful politician and diplomat. Ushakov&#x27;s squadron then blockaded French bases in Italy, notably Genoa and Ancona, and successfully assaulted Naples ( landing party of 600 men) and Rome (the detachments of and Colonel Skipor, 800 men). The Italians greeted the Russians as liberators: according to Balabin&#x27;s report, with the words &quot;Vivat Pavlo primo&quot;, &quot;vivat moscovito!&quot; The seizures of Naples and Rome became possible for Russia because the local French were forced to meet the Coalition towards Trebbia. Shortly after the capture of Rome, the Russian detachments returned to the squadron. Ferdinand IV asked Ushakov at the very end of 1799, during the departure of the Russian squadron, to leave Baillie and his party in Naples for some time.

Tsar Paul, in his capacity as the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, ordered Ushakov to proceed to Malta, which a British fleet under Nelson was assisting in besieging.

However, after rendezvousing with the Coalition forces on Malta, Ushakov was almost immediately recalled back home to Russia in 1800 (along with his fleet), where the new Emperor, Alexander I, failed to appreciate his victories. Ushakov resigned command in 1807 and withdrew into the Sanaksar Monastery in modern-day Mordovia. He was asked to command the local militia during the Patriotic War of 1812. He declined due to ill-health, but donated his savings.

In the course of 43 naval battles under his command he did not lose a single ship and never lost a battle.

== Tactics ==
Distinguishing features of Ushakov&#x27;s tactics were: use of unified marching and fighting orders; resolute closing to close quarters with the enemy forces without evolution of a fighting order; concentration of effort against enemy flagships; maintaining a reserve (Kaiser-flag squadrons); combination of aimed artillery fire and maneuvering; and chasing the enemy to its total destruction or capture. 

Giving great value to sea and fire training of his staff, Ushakov was a supporter of generalissimo Suvorov&#x27;s principles of training for sailors and officers. Ushakov&#x27;s innovations were among the first successful developments of naval tactics, from its &quot;line&quot; to maneuvering concepts.

== Legacy ==

Several warships have been named after Admiral Ushakov.

On 3 March 1944 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR established the Order of Ushakov for Navy officers who showed outstanding achievement leading to victory over a numerically superior enemy. This medal was one of several which was preserved in Russia upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, thus remaining one of the highest military awards in the Russian Federation. The Ushakov Medal was established simultaneously for servicemen who had risked their life in naval theatres defending the Soviet Union. In May 2014, the medal was presented to 19 surviving British sailors who had served on the Arctic convoys during World War II in a ceremony aboard HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;.

The Baltic Naval Institute in Kaliningrad also carries his name. The minor planet 3010 Ushakov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Ivanovna Chernykh in 1978, is named after him.

In 1953 two Soviet films were released portraying his career: &quot;Attack from the Sea&quot; and &quot;Admiral Ushakov&quot;. In both films he was played by Ivan Pereverzev.

Ushakov is one of the eight patrons depicted in the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ at Patriot Park, Moscow.

== Canonization ==
On 7 August 2001 the Russian Orthodox Church glorified Ushakov as a Saint and declared him the patron of the Russian Navy. His relics are enshrined in Sanaksar Monastery, Temnikov, Russia.

State Corporation Rostec implemented a project to bring Ushakov&#x27;s relics from Mordovia to Russia.

In 2005, in the Cathedral of St. Theodore Ushakov in Saransk (Mordovia), Patriarch Alexius II declared Saint Feodor (Theodore) Ushakov the patron saint of Russian nuclear-armed strategic bombers.

His feast days are 2 October (day of death), 23 July (glorification) and 23 May (saints of Yaroslavl and Rostov).

<text>Lovesongs for Underdogs is the solo debut album by American musician Tanya Donelly, who had formerly recorded with Throwing Muses, The Breeders, and Belly. It was released on September 8, 1997 and issued by 4AD and Sire Records.

==Release==
&quot;Lovesongs for Underdogs&quot; was released by Donelly&#x27;s European label 4AD on September 8, 1997, while Sire Records issued the album in the United States the following day. It peaked at number 36 on the UK Albums Chart upon its release.

Two singles were released from &quot;Lovesongs for Underdogs&quot;: &quot;Pretty Deep&quot; on August 18, 1997, and &quot;The Bright Light&quot; on November 24, 1997. Both singles were issued in CD format in two parts, each including two newly-released B-sides. &quot;Pretty Deep&quot; featured &quot;Spaghetti&quot;, &quot;Morna&quot;, &quot;These Days&quot;, and &quot;Influenza&quot;, while &quot;The Bright Light&quot; featured &quot;Bury My Heart&quot;, &quot;How Can You Sleep&quot;, &quot;Life on Sirius&quot;, and &quot;Moon Over Boston&quot;. &quot;Pretty Deep&quot; and &quot;The Bright Light&quot; peaked at numbers 55 and 64 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. A music video for each single was produced and aired on VH1 and MTV2.

<text>Bang Pa-in (, ) is one of the 16 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province, central Thailand.

==History==
Bang Pa-in was established in the Ayutthaya era in the name &quot;Khwaeng&quot; Uthai. In the Rattanakosin era &quot;Khwaeng&quot; Uthai was divided to be &quot;Khwaeng&quot; Uthai Noi and Uthai Yai. In 1910 &quot;Khwaeng&quot; Uthai Noi was changed status and renamed to Phra Ratchawang District. The district name was changed again to Bang Pa-in after the name of Bang Pa-in island in 1915.

Its name Bang Pa-in is believed to be distorted from &quot;Bang Phra In&quot; (บางพระอินทร์), literally meaning &quot;place of Indra&quot;, refers to place of Inthraracha, the title of Songtham before became the king. It is believed that he was the son of Ekathotsarot and local woman named In (อิน) or O In (อออิน). 

Bang Pa-in in Ayutthaya era was once called &quot;Bang Kradan&quot; (บางกระดาน) or &quot;Bang Khadan&quot; (บางขดาน), which means &quot;place of plain&quot;, since it was a spacious plain and a part of Thung Luang Field, a vast field of central region and Chao Phraya basin. It was also used as a place for royal water repellent ceremony during the flood season.

The historic building Bang Pa-in Royal Palace was built during the Prasat Thong&#x27;s reign, which was believed that he was a cousin to Songtham.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Uthai and Wang Noi of Ayutthaya province, Khlong Luang of Pathum Thani province, and Bang Sai of Ayutthaya.

==Administration==
The district is divided into 18 sub-districts (&quot;tambon&quot;), which are further subdivided into 149 villages (&quot;muban&quot;). There are nine municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas, and nine tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

<doc id="1147476" wikidata="Q5349979" url="?curid=1147476" title="Eisner v. Macomber">
<text>Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189 (1920), was a tax case before the United States Supreme Court that is notable for the following holdings:

*A &quot;&quot; stock dividend where a shareholder received no actual cash or other property and retained the same proportionate share of ownership of the corporation as was held prior to the dividend by the shareholder was not income to the shareholder under the Sixteenth Amendment.
*An income tax that was imposed by the Revenue Act of 1916 on such a dividend was unconstitutional even if the dividend indirectly represented accrued earnings of the corporation.

==Prior cases==

In 1895, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; that a tax from income on property, unlike a tax on income from employment or vocations, had to be proportionate to the states&#x27; congressional representation. In 1913, the United States ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed taxation of income without regard to source (income from either property or vocations and employment) and without regard to a state&#x27;s Congressional representation.

In 1918, the Court, in &quot;Towne v. Eisner&quot; , had addressed a nearly-identical situation to one in 
&quot;Eisner v. Macomber&quot;. (Eisner was responsible for Internal Revenue Collection in both cases).

However, in the aftermath of &quot;Towne v. Eisner&quot;, the US Congress passed a revenue collection statute that specifically stated that stock dividends were to be considered as income.

==Facts==

Myrtle H. Macomber owned 2,200 shares in Standard Oil, which declared a 50% stock dividend. She received 1,100 additional shares, about $20,000 in par value of which represented earnings accumulated by the company, recapitalized rather than distributed, since the effective date of the original tax law.

The current statute expressly included stock dividends in income, and the government contended that the certificates should be taxed as income to Macomber as if the corporation had distributed money to her. She sued Mark Eisner, the Collector of Internal Revenue, for a refund.

===Economic substance of a stock dividend===
The stock dividend in this case was the economic equivalent of a stock split, a transaction in which the corporation multiplies the total number of shares outstanding but gives the new shares to shareholders in proportion to the number that they had held. For example, if a corporation declares a &quot;two for one&quot; stock split and distributes no money or other property to any stockholder, a stockholder who held 100 shares at $4 per share will now hold 200 shares with a value of $2 each, both of which with $400 in value.

===Stock dividends vs. cash dividends===
A shareholder&#x27;s assets do not grow after this sort of stock dividend. Metaphorically, the &quot;pie&quot; is still the same size, but it has been sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller. Of course, the same is true of a cash dividend: the shareholder gains cash, but the corporation that is represented by his shares has also lost cash. The shares thus implicitly decline in value by an equal amount.

A shareholder also makes no &quot;sale or other disposition&quot; of stock after this sort of stock dividend. The taxpayer still owns the same proportionate percentage of the corporation that was owned before the stock dividend. Again, that is true of a cash dividend as well.

However, several important factors distinguish a stock and cash dividend. &quot;Overall, the aim of the tax law is to impose a tax on &quot;dividends&quot; when assets representing corporate earnings are transferred to the shareholders. Stock dividends, however, merely give the shareholders additional pieces of paper to represent the same equitable interest; they do not transfer assets or create new priorities among the security-holders. The total value of the common shares, though now spread out over a larger number of units, is left unchanged from its previous level. In effect, nothing of substance has occurred.&quot;

The issue in the case was the following:

==Decision==
In the majority opinion, Justice Mahlon Pitney ruled that the stock dividend was not a realization of income by the taxpayer-shareholder for the purposes of the Sixteenth Amendment:

::We are clear that not only does a stock dividend really take nothing from the property of the corporation and add nothing to that of the shareholder, but that the antecedent accumulation of profits evidenced thereby, while indicating that the shareholder is richer because of an increase of his capital, at the same time shows he has not realized or received any income in the transaction.

The Court noted that in &quot;Towne v. Eisner&quot;, it had clearly stated that stock dividends were not income, as nothing of value was received by Towne; the company was not worth any less than it was when the dividend was declared, and the total value of Towne&#x27;s stock had not changed.

Although the Court acknowledged the power of the Federal Government to tax income under the Sixteenth Amendment, it essentially said that Congress was not given the power to tax as income anything other than income. In others words, Congress did not have the power to redefine &quot;income&quot; as it appeared in the Constitution:

::Throughout the argument of the Government, in a variety of forms, runs the fundamental error already mentioned—a failure to appraise correctly the force of the term &quot;income&quot; as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, or at least to give practical effect to it. Thus, the Government contends that the tax &quot;is levied on income derived from corporate earnings,&quot; when in truth the stockholder has &quot;derived&quot; nothing except paper certificates which, so far as they have any effect, deny him [or &quot;her&quot; — in this case, Mrs. Macomber] present participation in such earnings. It [the government] contends that the tax may be laid when earnings &quot;are received by the stockholder,&quot; whereas [s]he has received none; that the profits are &quot;distributed by means of a stock dividend,&quot; although a stock dividend distributes no profits; that under the Act of 1916 &quot;the tax is on the stockholder&#x27;s share in corporate earnings,&quot; when in truth a stockholder has no such share, and receives none in a stock dividend; that &quot;the profits are segregated from his [her] former capital, and [s]he has a separate certificate representing his [her] invested profits or gains,&quot; whereas there has been no segregation of profits, nor has [s]he any separate certificate representing a personal gain, since the certificates, new and old, are alike in what they represent—a capital interest in the entire concerns of the corporation.

The Court ordered that Macomber be refunded the tax she overpaid.

===Dissents===
In the dissent, Justice Louis Brandeis took issue with the majority&#x27;s interpretation of income. He argued that the Sixteenth Amendment authorized Congress to tax &quot;incomes, from whatever source derived&quot; and that the authors of the amendment &quot;intended to include thereby everything which by reasonable understanding can fairly be regarded as income.&quot; Also, &quot;Congress possesses the power which it exercised to make dividends representing profits, taxable as income, whether the medium in which the dividend is paid be cash or stock, and that it may define, as it has done, what dividends representing profits shall be deemed income.&quot;

He noted that in business circles, cash dividends and stock dividends were treated identically. In effect, he argued that a stock dividend is really a cash dividend since it is really two-step affair, with a cash distribution that is then used to purchase additional shares by the exercise of stock subscription rights. Brandeis saw no reason for two essentially-identical transactions to be treated differently for tax purposes:

==Aftermath==
In any event, the success of investors in avoiding tax was short lived. The following year, the Court ruled that capital gains were income and that they should be recognized as income when the stock was sold. In addition, the exception for stock dividends was narrowed by the Court in such cases as &quot;United States v. Phellis&quot;, (shares in a subsidiary corporation that were issued to stockholders in the parent corporation were taxable as income); &quot;Rockefeller v. United States&quot; and &quot;Cullinan v. Walker&quot; (increases in capital accumulated by corporations over time were taxable when shares were distributed to stockholders in a successor corporation).

In 1940, the Supreme Court departed from the realization concept described in &quot;Eisner v. Macomber&quot; when it held in &quot;Helvering v. Bruun&quot;, that &quot;severance&quot; is not an element of realization. In &quot;Bruun&quot;, a taxpayer-landlord repossessed a property from a tenant—property that had been subject to a 99-year lease - after the tenant failed to pay rent and taxes. The lease had allowed for the tenant to construct a new building or other improvements. The tenant had removed the existing building and built a new one. The value of the new building, as of the date of repossession, was $64,245.68. The government contended that the landlord realized a gain of $51,434.25, the difference between the value of the building at the date of repossession and the landlord&#x27;s basis in the old building of $12,811.43. The landlord argued that there was no realization of the property because no transaction had occurred, and that the improvement of the property that created the gain was unseverable from the landlord&#x27;s original capital.

The Court ruled against the landlord and decided that the landlord had realized a gain upon repossession of the property. The Court also said that &quot;severance&quot; was no longer an element of realization.

==Use by tax protesters==
&quot;Eisner v. Macomber&quot; is a key case in US income tax law. Its rather narrow but important application has been used by tax protesters who argue that wages from labor cannot be taxed as income. The &quot;Macomber&quot; decision was not about wages, but stock dividends.

Here is a typical quote from the case used as support of this position:

In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from Article I of the Constitution may have proper force and effect save only as modified by the Amendment, and that the latter also may have proper effect, it is essential to distinguish between what is and what is not income&quot; as the term is there used; and to apply the distinction as cases arise according to truth and substance without regard to form. &quot;Congress by any definition it may adopt cannot conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised&quot; [emphasis added]

The Supreme Court in the case discussed what was income, and quoted from &quot;Towne v. Eisner&quot;:

Just as we deem the legislative intent manifest to tax the stockholder with respect to such accumulations only if and when, and to the extent that, his interest in them comes to fruition as income, that is, in dividends declared, so we can perceive no constitutional obstacle that stands in the way of carrying out this intent when dividends are declared out of a pre-existing surplus... &quot;Congress was at liberty under the amendment to tax as income, without apportionment, everything that became income, in the ordinary sense of the word, after the adoption of the amendment, including dividends received in the ordinary course by a stockholder from a corporation&quot;, even though they were extraordinary in amount and might appear upon analysis to be a mere realization in possession of an inchoate and contingent interest that the stockholder had in a surplus of corporate assets previously existing. [emphasis added]

Important principles in &quot;Eisner v. Macomber&quot; are that the word &quot;income&quot; in the Sixteenth Amendment is generally given its ordinary plain English meaning and that wealth and property that are not income may not be taxed &quot;as income&quot; by the Federal Government.

<doc id="1147495" wikidata="Q1230959" url="?curid=1147495" title="Hal Needham">
<text>Hal Brett Needham (March 6, 1931 – October 25, 2013) was an American stuntman, film director, actor, writer, and NASCAR team owner. He is best known for his frequent collaborations with actor Burt Reynolds, usually in films involving fast cars, such as &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981) and &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; (1983). 

In his later years, Needham moved out of stunt work, and focused his energy on the world land speed record project. In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards, and in 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

== Early years ==
Needham was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Edith May (née Robinson) and Howard Needham. He was the youngest of three children. Raised in Arkansas and Missouri, Needham served in the United States Army as a paratrooper during the Korean War, worked as a treetopper (an arborist who performs tree topping services),
and was a billboard model for Viceroy Cigarettes while beginning a career in Hollywood as a motion picture stuntman.

==Career==
Needham&#x27;s first break was as the stunt double for actor Richard Boone on the popular TV western &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;. Needham trained under John Wayne&#x27;s stunt double Chuck Roberson and quickly became one of the top stuntmen of the 1960s on such films as &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot;, &quot;McLintock!&quot;, &quot;The War Lord&quot;, and &quot;Little Big Man&quot;. He doubled regularly for Clint Walker and Burt Reynolds. He played a cowboy in an episode of the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (S8E36 - “The Odyssey of Jubal Tanner”). Needham moved into stunt coordinating and directing second unit action, while designing and introducing air bags and other innovative equipment to the industry. Needham at one time lived in Reynolds&#x27; guesthouse for the better part of 12 years.

In 1971, he and fellow stuntmen Glenn Wilder and Ronnie Rondell formed Stunts Unlimited. Needham had written a screenplay titled &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and his friend Reynolds offered him the chance to direct. The film was a huge hit, and the two followed it with &quot;Hooper&quot;, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;, and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;. Needham also directed the TV pilots &quot;Stunts Unlimited&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Stockers&quot; (1981), neither of which was picked up as a series. His final theatrical release as director was the 1986 BMX film &quot;Rad&quot;.

In 1977, Gabriel Toys introduced the &quot;Hal Needham Western Movie Stunt Set&quot; complete with a cardboard old west saloon movie set, lights and props, a toy movie camera and a spring-launched Hal Needham action figure that would break through a balcony railing, land on breakaway table and chairs and crash through a window. They were only manufactured for a short time and have since become highly collectible.

Needham moved out of stunt work, focusing his energy on the World Land Speed Record project that eventually became the Budweiser Rocket, driven by stuntman Stan Barrett. The team failed to set an officially sanctioned World land speed record with the vehicle, and their claims to have broken the sound barrier in 1979 have been heavily disputed. 

In the 1980s, he and Reynolds co-owned the Mach 1 Racing team, which fielded the Skoal Bandit No. 33 Pontiac in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, with Barrett as the driver. Stan was later replaced by Harry Gant, and the team eventually switched to Buicks. The Skoal Bandit became a championship contender, and Gant&#x27;s 18 victories resulted in his Nascar Hall of Fame Hall of Fame nomination. 

In 1986, Needham, alongside William L. Fredrick, was awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for his efforts in developing the Shotmaker Elite camera car and crane.

In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards. In 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, where he was introduced by Quentin Tarantino.

Needham and his relationship with Reynolds inspired the Cliff Booth/Rick Dalton friendship in Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

== Rocket car ==
Needham was the owner of the Budweiser Rocket car, a vehicle intended to break the speed of sound on land.

== Death ==
Needham died on October 25, 2013, in Los Angeles, California, aged 82, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer.

<text>inXile Entertainment, Inc. is an American video game developer and a studio of Xbox Game Studios based in Tustin, California. Specializing in role-playing video games, inXile was founded in 2002 by Interplay co-founder Brian Fargo. The studio produced the fantasy games &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;&quot;, along with various games for Flash and iOS such as &quot;Fantastic Contraption&quot; in its first decade of development. In 2014, inXile released the post-apocalyptic game &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Following the game&#x27;s critical success, the studio went on to raise a then-record US$4 million on Kickstarter to develop &quot;&quot;, a spiritual successor to Interplay&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The studio was purchased by Microsoft and became part of Xbox Game Studios in 2018, just as they were developing &quot;Wasteland 3&quot;, which they released in 2020. The studio is currently developing &quot;Clockwork Revolution&quot; for Windows and Xbox Series X/S.

== History ==
inXile Entertainment was founded on October 26, 2002, by Brian Fargo in Newport Beach, California.

In an interview with Joystiq, inXile&#x27;s President Matthew Findley shared some of the company&#x27;s history: &quot;I worked with Brian Fargo at Interplay for a number of years and we both left Interplay at the same time. We knew we wanted to stay in video games, so starting a company seemed like a good idea -- he spent 20 years at Interplay and I was there for 13. When we were first out there, trying to figure out what to do next, we kinda felt like we were in exile, and we made fake cards with a fake company name just to have a card to go to E3 with. And before we ever thought of the name &quot;inXile&quot;, Brian put as his job description on the cards: &quot;Leader in exile.&quot; People got such a kick out of that card, we kept saying &quot;in exile, in exile, in exile&quot; so much that we just thought, &quot;Why not make up a new word?&quot; And so we did.&quot;

In May 2008, inXile announced the creation of SparkWorkz, an online business division with a focus on user-generated content, using their experience with &quot;Line Rider&quot; as base for the venture. David Heeley, a former executive for Microsoft, was hired to oversee the creation of the division.

In April 2012, inXile launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, the sequel to Interplay&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland&quot;, with most of the original team on board. The crowdfunding drive raised more than 300% of its initial goal of $900,000, ending at $2,933,252. In March 2013, inXile returned to Kickstarter to crowdfund &quot;&quot;. The Kickstarter for &quot;Torment: Tides of Numenera&quot; broke the record of fastest Kickstart drive to $1 million, raising that amount in seven hours and two minutes.

During a Kickstarter campaign for the game &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, Brian Fargo developed the Kicking it Forward program. Under this program, inXile Entertainment pledged to use 5% of post-launch net profits to back future Kickstarter projects.
In October 2015, inXile opened inXile New Orleans as a second studio based in New Orleans. The Newport Beach office was moved to Tustin by January 2021.

In November 2018, Microsoft Studios announced they were in the final stages of acquiring InXile, as well as Obsidian Entertainment, another studio known for its role-playing games. According to Fargo, they were approached in April 2018 by Noah Musler, one of Microsoft&#x27;s business development executives that had former ties to the studio, who suggested the possibility of acquisition. Fargo believed the acquisition was beneficial for the studio, as at the time, they were in the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; between more independent game development and high-budget AAA games where there was a significant difference in expectations on quality and pricing of the game. Microsoft&#x27;s support would help them make games that are closer to AAA games and better compete in the current state of the industry.

In June 2023, inXile unveiled their new game &quot;Clockwork Revolution&quot; during the Xbox Games Showcase 2023.

<doc id="1147503" wikidata="Q4908612" url="?curid=1147503" title="Bill Crews (politician)">
<text>Bill Crews (born July 12, 1952) is an American politician who served as the mayor of Melbourne, Iowa, from 1984 through 1998. Crews came out at the LGBT Equality March on Washington, D.C., in 1993, where he attracted national attention as a result of hate graffiti on his Melbourne house.

==Political career==
Crews was an attorney working in the office of the Iowa state governor when he was approached to run for mayor, having moved to Melbourne just three months earlier. At the elections held the following year, Crews won all 57 votes cast. He was re-elected in the 1987, 1991, and 1995 elections.

During Crews&#x27; service as mayor of Melbourne, the city built a new fire station and library, improved water and sewer infrastructure and increased cash reserves.

Formerly a moderate Republican, he claimed &quot;I was a Republican from before the fundamentalists took over the Iowa party. I believe in progressive, fiscally responsible government. I am now a registered Democrat. I&#x27;m pro-choice; I&#x27;ve always been.&quot;

Crews ran for the Iowa Senate in 1992 but lost by just 57 votes. After moving to the District of Columbia, Crews served two terms as an elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner (SMD 6C07) in the neighborhood of Capitol Hill. Crews also served as the Zoning Administrator for the District of Columbia from 2005 through 2007. Crews was once again elected as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in 2010.

==Personal life==

Crews&#x27; father, a United Methodist minister who fought for social justice, was killed in a car accident in 1973. Bill Crews was also active in the United Methodist church after coming out, until 1998 when he relocated to Washington, D.C., with his husband.

He has said his early influences included Charles Mingus, Ray Brown and Ron Carter on upright bass; and James Jamerson, Paul McCartney and Chuck Rainey on electric bass. He studied music at UC San Diego. Nathan East is also an accomplished amateur magician member of The Magic Castle and the Academy of Magical Arts.

===Music career===

East is a founding member of the contemporary jazz band Fourplay with Bob James (keyboards), Lee Ritenour on guitar (later replaced by Larry Carlton and Chuck Loeb) and Harvey Mason (drums).

He has worked with Bobby Womack (on the album &quot;The Poet&quot;), Babyface, Anita Baker, The Bee Gees, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Gail Ann Dorsey, Bryan Ferry, Daft Punk, Herbie Hancock, George Harrison, Michael Jackson, Al Jarreau, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, B.B. King, Kenny Loggins, The Love Unlimited Orchestra, The Manhattan Transfer, Ed O&#x27;Brien, Laura Pausini, Savage Garden, Sting, Barry White, and Stevie Wonder. He co-wrote the song &quot;Easy Lover&quot; for Phil Collins and Philip Bailey. In 2013, he recorded the bass line for the 2013 hit &quot;Get Lucky&quot; by Daft Punk, which won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (2014). Since the 1980s, East has been a member of Eric Clapton&#x27;s studio and touring bands. East was invited to play at We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in 2009.

In early 2010, he was invited to join American Grammy Award-winning rock band Toto on their reunion tour to benefit member Mike Porcaro, who had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. East later joined Toto for their 2011 and 2012 tours as well. He joined Eric Clapton&#x27;s band for concerts in Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and Dubai in February and March 2014 and again for the Madison Square Garden and Royal Albert Hall concerts in May 2015.

East&#x27;s self-titled debut solo album was released on March 25, 2014. During recording, he was joined by several of his longtime associates, including Stevie Wonder, Michael McDonald, Eric Clapton, Ray Parker Jr., and Greg Phillinganes.

In 2023, East performed with Eric Clapton during his Tokyo Residency at the Nippon Budokan from April 15–24. Returning from Japan, East joined Eric Clapton&#x27;s nephew, Will Johns, and The Cream of Clapton Band at their April 30 show in San Diego. East&#x27;s son, Noah East, has been a part of The Cream of Clapton Band since early 2023 and toured with the band throughout the spring of 2023.

==Equipment==

With Yamaha, East developed a custom 5-string bass guitar signature model, the BBNE (modeled after his early 1980s BB5000 5-string bass). The second signature bass, the BBNE2, was released in 2001. A limited edition 30th Anniversary version (the BBNE2 LTD) was released in 2011. He has also used custom 6-string prototypes of his BBNE2 bass guitar between 2003 and 2005, along with his black 1980s LB-1 Motion 5-string bass and a pair of 6-string TRB6P models. Yamaha introduced the NE1 Parametric EQ Pedal, otherwise known as the &quot;Magic Box&quot; in the early 2000s. This pedal essentially gives the player the ability to use the &quot;Nathan East EQ curve&quot; on any bass they choose. East also plays a Yamaha SLB200 Silent Upright Bass.

In 2019, East co-developed a custom in-ear monitor dubbed N8 (a product abbreviation that plays on East&#x27;s first name, Nate) with 64 Audio, an Oregon-based manufacturer of in-ear monitors for stage performers, mixing engineers and audio enthusiasts.

<text>Maurice Zbriger (July 10, 1896, Kamenets-Podolskiy, Ukraine – April 5, 1981, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was a Canadian violinist, composer and conductor. He began learning violin as a child, and continued his studies at the conservatory in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he was a classmate of Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein and Mischa Elman.

He left Russia in 1920 and traveled throughout Europe, until he arrived in Montreal in 1924. He quickly found work there at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, in silent film houses, and other venues. He was one of the founders of the Traymore Quartet in 1925, which later became the Traymore Salon Orchestra. He was one of the first Canadians to specialize in Roma music and performed and conducted for a radio show that ran on the station CKAC for 40 years.

Zbriger became a partner in, and eventually the sole owner of, the Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen. Better known as &quot;Schwartz&#x27;s&quot;, this restaurant is famous for its distinctive Montreal-style smoked meat. With the profits from this business, Zbriger spent many thousands of dollars organizing free concerts of his music.

Zbriger was unable to pursue a career as a concert violinist because his wife was in poor health. Mrs. Zbriger was a pianist and co-composed music with Maurice, until her death after 65 years of marriage.

Many of Zbriger&#x27;s compositions were dedicated to famous people. He wrote &quot;The Vincent Massey March&quot; (1952) for the Canadian statesman of the same name, while &quot;Mother&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; (1948) was dedicated to Charles, Prince of Wales upon his birth. The individuals honored by Zbriger frequently received copies of the music with letters he commissioned.

In his later years, arthritis in his hands prevented Zbriger from performing publicly, though he continued to compose and conduct until his death.

<doc id="1147517" wikidata="Q539654" url="?curid=1147517" title="Chris Carmack">
<text>Chris Carmack (born December 22, 1980) is an American actor, singer, and former fashion model. He is known for his roles in three popular television shows—the teen drama series &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2004) as Luke Ward, the country music drama &quot;Nashville&quot; as Will Lexington (2012–2018), and the medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2018–present) as Dr. Atticus Lincoln.

Carmack has also appeared in films, including &quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations&quot;, &quot;Into the Blue 2: The Reef&quot;, &quot;Love Wrecked&quot;, &quot;Beauty &amp; the Briefcase&quot; and &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Carmack grew up in Derwood, Maryland. He has a brother and a sister. As a young boy, he played baseball, basketball, and football at Magruder High School, however; his attentions turned to theater and he began working on three productions per year, on-stage and off, in addition to competing in numerous drama festivals.

==Career==
After graduation, Carmack attended New York University to pursue an arts degree at the Tisch School. He left NYU after he was discovered by John Yannella, a modeling scout, and decided to have a go at the profession. His looks were exactly what Bruce Weber was seeking for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. The other catalogs and editorials that he has worked for include: Lord and Taylor, Macy&#x27;s, Target, Who.A.U, &quot;Elle&quot; France, Nautica, Guess?, and &quot;Cosmogirl&quot;.

After two years in New York City, Carmack moved to Los Angeles and immersed himself in acting. He played Luke on the first season of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, but did not continue because producers could not guarantee him airtime in the upcoming year. In 2005, Carmack became a model for Ezra Fitch, a limited upscale label sold at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

In 2006, Carmack starred in the film &quot;Lovewrecked&quot; with Amanda Bynes and Jonathan Bennett and honed his acting skills in the theaters of New York and London.

From March 16 to May 21, 2006 Carmack starred in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot; at the Laura Pels Theatre. The play, directed by Scott Ellis, also featured Tony Award nominees Alec Baldwin and Jan Maxwell.

In 2006, Carmack made his London stage debut in a rare revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, a play that had not been performed in London for 55 years. Carmack starred opposite Rosamund Pike and was directed by former Royal Shakespeare Company artistic director Adrian Noble. It played the Apollo Theatre from October 21 – November 25, 2006, failing to complete its scheduled run.

Carmack portrayed Susan Delfino&#x27;s cousin Tim in the television show &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; for one episode.

Carmack portrayed Sam Reide, the main character of the film &quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations&quot;, the third film in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; film franchise, released in theaters in January 2009. He also made his first voice role in &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;, which was released in theaters in September 17, 2010, and reprised his role as Garth in &quot;Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure&quot;, being one of the few actors from the original to appear in at least one sequel.

In 2013, Carmack was cast in the ABC drama series &quot;Nashville&quot; as Scarlett and Gunnar&#x27;s neighbor Will, a sexy and charming country singer and guitar player. Carmack&#x27;s character initially appeared to be a womanizer and a potential threat to Scarlett and Gunnar&#x27;s relationship, but it was revealed that the character is gay, and trying to protect his image as a heterosexual country music heartthrob. Carmack appeared in the final six episodes of the season, and was promoted from a recurring role to a series regular for season 2.

In 2018, Carmack was cast as Dr. Atticus &quot;Link&quot; Lincoln on the ABC hit medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

In 2019, Carmack made his Hollywood Bowl debut playing the role of Rapunzel&#x27;s Prince in the show &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carmack announced his engagement to Erin Slaver on March 2, 2016. They married on October 20, 2018. Their first daughter was born in August 2016, and a second daughter was born in May 2022.

<doc id="1147528" wikidata="Q597332" url="?curid=1147528" title="Purdy, Washington">
<text>Purdy is a small unincorporated community and census-designated place north of the city of Gig Harbor, and at the junction of Washington State Routes 16 and 302 on the northern boundary of Pierce County, Washington.

Purdy is on the shores of Burley Lagoon and Henderson Bay at the northern end of Carr Inlet in Puget Sound. The lagoon and bay are separated by a sandspit and the Purdy Bridge.

The Washington Corrections Center for Women, originally named the Purdy Treatment Center, is colloquially referred to as &quot;Purdy&quot;, though it has a Gig Harbor address.

As of the 2010 US Census, Purdy had a population of 1544.

==History==
Prior to white settlement, the area was inhabited by Native Americans, who fished and clammed on Henderson Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPN 11/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, one Isaac Hawk sold of land for $23.75 (). The purchaser was logger and Civil War veteran Horace Knapp (born March 23, 1845, in Titusville, Pennsylvania; died February 1, 1913, in Gig Harbor, Washington), who subdivided the land into lots and blocks to form the town of Purdy. The town&#x27;s naming rights were taken by Joseph W. Purdy, a grocer from Tacoma, Washington, who had donated the materials to construct the community&#x27;s first schoolhouse; the schoolhouse&#x27;s land was donated by Knapp.

On February 8, 1885, Knapp married Josephine Fuller, after which they moved to the Purdy area, making her Purdy&#x27;s first white female settler. Knapp owned a floating logging camp on Burley Lagoon which included a cookhouse and bunks for the loggers.

A mill was built in 1885 by James Ashton, Joseph Purdy, William Rowland, and a Mr. Sherman on a small inlet of Burley Lagoon just down the hill from present day Peninsula High School. In 1886, the Purdy mill secured its first contract to provide huge lumber with one edge beveled for the construction of a wooden dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in nearby Bremerton. The mill could underbid their competitors because they used an extra saw to cut the bevel, which allowed them to use only four trips of the saw carriage instead of five.

Purdy became known as a &quot;brawling mill town&quot;. The mill&#x27;s success brought such conveniences as a grocery store and a post office to the area, the latter sited on Knapp&#x27;s floating camp from 1886 to 1895 after which the function transferred to Springfield (Wauna, Washington). A long chute along present-day 144th Street brought logs down the hill to the water. Mr Ouellette, known as &quot;the Frenchman&quot;, began canning native Olympia oysters gathered from his land on the Purdy spit around 1900. He gathered these native oysters to near extinction. Japanese oysters are still cultivated on Purdy&#x27;s sandbars and in Burley Lagoon, as are clams.

The original schoolhouse was abandoned in the 1890s. In 1900, the second Purdy Schoolhouse was built to replace it on land (also donated by Knapp) located on Sherman Avenue (present-day 68th Avenue). Students spent every other semester at either the Purdy Schoolhouse, or the Wauna Schoolhouse to keep both schools active. The modern-day Peninsula High School now sits on the hill where one of the original schoolhouses was built. The Second schoolhouse stood until 2015, when it was demolished to build a new home.

<text>Jaromír Nohavica or Jarek Nohavica (born 7 June 1953, in Ostrava) is a Czech recording artist, songwriter, lyricist and poet.

==Early life==
He was born in Ostrava and has played guitar since he was 13. He began studies at the Technical University of Ostrava but eventually left the school. He tried various jobs, including as a freelance lyricist. He gained fame with his first song for Marie Rottrová, &quot;Lásko, voníš deštěm&quot; (You Smell of Rain, My Love; actually a cover version of the song &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot; by Black Sabbath). He lives in Ostrava with his wife and two children.

== Career ==
In 1982, he started performing in public, and his songs gained popularity. His first album, &quot;Darmoděj&quot; (The Wastrel), released in 1988, sold out immediately. A mythical aura arose around Nohavica which survived even the crisis period of his treatment for alcoholism. He released the somewhat pessimistic &quot;Mikymauzoleum&quot; (Mickey Mausoleum), an album containing mainly melancholic songs. 

Meanwhile, from 1986 he was a collaborator of the StB, secret police force in communist Czechoslovakia.

In 1994, he recorded a live album, &quot;Tři čuníci&quot; (Three Piglets), intended for children, with humorous songs.

In 1996, Nohavica released &quot;Divné století&quot; (Strange Century). He and his producer employed new instruments and voices for the new songs on the album, which became a huge success. Two years later the &quot;Jaromir Nohavica and Kapela&quot; (i.e. the Band) came out with &quot;Koncert&quot; (Concert), a record featuring Nohavica playing with a band, which recognizably changed his music. The album contains mainly older material, but his treatment gave it a new appeal. His studio album from 2000, &quot;Moje smutné srdce&quot; (My Sad Heart), contained mostly sad songs about love.

Nohavica also starred in Petr Zelenka&#x27;s movie &quot;Rok Ďábla&quot; (Year of the Devil), which was awarded the main prize at the 37th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2002 and several other international film festivals. He translated the Polish musical &quot;Painted on Glass&quot; for Divadlo Na Fidlovačce and poeticized Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; for the National Moravian-Silesian Theatre.

He has enjoyed popularity in neighbouring Poland and Slovakia, as well as Czech Republic.

In 2007, Czech singer-songwriter Jaroslav Hutka accused Nohavica of having collaborated with the StB (the Communist-era Czechoslovak secret police). Documents released the previous year indicated that in the 1980s, Nohavica had met two exponents of the Czechoslovak exile culture Karel Kryl and Pavel Kohout in Austria, and had informed the police about their activities.

<text>Edward Thomas Rabbitt (November 27, 1941 – May 7, 1998) was an American country music singer and songwriter. His career began as a songwriter in the late 1960s, springboarding to a recording career after composing hits such as &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot; for Elvis Presley in 1970 and &quot;Pure Love&quot; for Ronnie Milsap in 1974. Later in the 1970s, Rabbitt helped to develop the crossover-influenced sound of country music prevalent in the 1980s with such hits as &quot;Suspicions&quot;, &quot;I Love a Rainy Night&quot; (a number-one hit single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), and &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (the theme from the film of the same title). His duets &quot;Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)&quot; with Juice Newton and &quot;You and I&quot; with Crystal Gayle later appeared on the soap operas &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;.

==Early life==
Rabbitt was born to Irish immigrants Thomas Michael and Mae (née Joyce) Rabbitt in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, in 1941, and was raised in the nearby community of East Orange, New Jersey. His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local New York City dance halls. By age 12, Rabbitt was a proficient guitar player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath. During his childhood, Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed &quot;walking encyclopedia of country music&quot;. After his parents divorced, he dropped out of East Orange High School at age 16. His mother, Mae, explained that Eddie &quot;was never one for school [because] his head was too full of music.&quot; He later obtained a high school diploma at night school.

==Career==

===Early career===
Rabbitt worked as a mental hospital attendant in the late 1950s; but, like his father, he fulfilled his love of music by performing at the Six Steps Down club in his hometown. He later won a talent contest and was given an hour of Saturday night radio show time to broadcast a live performance from a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1964, he signed his first record deal with 20th Century Records and released the singles &quot;Next to the Note&quot; and &quot;Six Nights and Seven Days&quot;. Four years later, with $1,000 to his name, Rabbitt moved to Nashville, where he began his career as a songwriter. During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote &quot;Working My Way Up to the Bottom&quot;, which Roy Drusky recorded in 1968. To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a truck driver, soda jerk, and fruit picker in Nashville. He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the Hill &amp; Range Publishing Company for $37.50 per week. As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally&#x27;s Clubhouse, a Nashville bar; he said he and the other patrons had &quot;no place else to go.&quot;

Rabbitt became successful as a songwriter in 1969, when Elvis Presley recorded his song &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot;. The song went gold, and cast Rabbitt as one of Nashville&#x27;s leading young songwriters. Presley also recorded Rabbitt&#x27;s song &quot;Patch It Up&quot;, which was featured in the concert film &quot;Elvis: That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, and a lesser-known Rabbitt song called &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; on the album &quot;Back in Memphis&quot;. While eating Cap&#x27;n Crunch, he penned &quot;Pure Love&quot;, which Ronnie Milsap rode to number one in 1974. This song led to a contract offer from Elektra Records.

Rabbitt signed with Elektra Records in 1975. His first single under that label, &quot;You Get to Me&quot;, made the top 40 that year; and two songs in 1975, &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Married You&quot;, nearly made the top 10. These three songs, along with a recording of &quot;Pure Love&quot;, were included on Rabbitt&#x27;s 1975 self-named debut album. The year 1976 saw the release of his critically acclaimed album &quot;Rocky Mountain Music&quot;, which included Rabbitt&#x27;s first number-one country hit, &quot;Drinkin&#x27; My Baby (Off My Mind)&quot;. In 1977, his third album, &quot;Rabbitt&quot;, was released, and made the top five on the Country Albums chart. Also in 1977, the Academy of Country Music named Rabbitt &quot;Top New Male Vocalist of the Year&quot;. By that time, Rabbitt had a good reputation in Nashville, and was being compared by critics to singer Kris Kristofferson. That year, at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, Rabbitt appeared at the Academy of Country Music Awards and sang several of his songs from &quot;Rocky Mountain Music&quot;. He won the Top New Male Vocalist of the Year award.

===Crossover success===
While still relatively unknown, Rabbitt toured with and opened for crossover star Kenny Rogers, and also for Dolly Parton on a number of dates during her 1978 tour. Following the 1978 release of &quot;Variations&quot;, which included two more number-one hits, Rabbitt released his first compilation album, &quot;The Best of Eddie Rabbitt&quot;. It produced Rabbitt&#x27;s first crossover single, &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot;, which topped country charts and reached the top 30 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary, and was featured in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie of the same title. The song also broke the record for highest chart debut, entering at number 18. Rabbitt held this record alone until it was matched by Garth Brooks&#x27;s 2005 single &quot;Good Ride Cowboy.&quot; The record was broken in 2006 upon the number-17 chart entrance of Keith Urban&#x27;s &quot;Once in a Lifetime.&quot; Rabbitt&#x27;s next single, the R&amp;B-flavored &quot;Suspicions&quot; from his 1979 album &quot;Loveline&quot;, was an even greater crossover success, reaching number one on Country charts, the top 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number five on the Adult Contemporary charts. He was given his own television special on NBC, first airing on July 10, 1980, which included appearances by such performers as Emmylou Harris and Jerry Lee Lewis. By this point, Rabbitt had been compared to a &quot;young Elvis Presley&quot;.
Rabbitt&#x27;s next album, &quot;Horizon&quot;, reached platinum status and contained the biggest crossover hits of his career, &quot;I Love a Rainy Night&quot; and &quot;Drivin&#x27; My Life Away.&quot; Rabbitt developed &quot;Rainy Night&quot; from a song fragment he penned during a 1960s thunderstorm. &quot;Drivin&#x27;&quot; recalled Rabbitt&#x27;s tenure as a truck driver, and was inspired by Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;. His popularity was so great at this point that he was offered his own variety television show, which he respectfully declined, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not worth the gamble.&quot;

The release of his 1981 &quot;Step by Step&quot; album continued Rabbitt&#x27;s crossover success as all three singles reached the top 10 on both Country and Adult Contemporary charts. The title track became Rabbitt&#x27;s third straight single to reach the top five on the Country, Adult Contemporary, and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. The album ultimately reached gold status, Rabbitt&#x27;s last album to do so. Rabbitt teamed up with another country pop crossover star, Crystal Gayle, on &quot;You and I&quot;, which was included on his 1982 album &quot;Radio Romance&quot;. The duet reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country chart and became a pop smash, peaking at number seven and number two, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It was used as a love theme for a couple on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. The song &quot;You Put the Beat in My Heart&quot; from Rabbitt&#x27;s second compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits - Volume II&quot; (1983), was his last crossover hit, reaching number 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

===Late career===
During the 1980s, Rabbitt moved further from crossover-styled music. His 1984 album &quot;The Best Year of My Life&quot; produced a number-one country hit and three more top-10 country hits, but none had crossover success. The illness and subsequent death of his son put his career on hold following the 1985 RCA Records release &quot;Rabbitt Trax&quot;, which included the number one &quot;Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)&quot;, a duet with country pop star Juice Newton. Like &quot;You and I&quot;, the song was used as the theme for a soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Rabbitt returned from his hiatus in 1988 with the release of &quot;I Wanna Dance With You&quot;, which despite somewhat negative reviews produced two number-one songs, a cover of Dion&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track. Additionally, &quot;We Must Be Doin&#x27; Somethin&#x27; Right&quot; entered the top 10, although the album&#x27;s final single &quot;That&#x27;s Why I Fell in Love with You&quot; stalled at number 66. Rabbitt&#x27;s Capitol Records album &quot;Jersey Boy&quot; was reviewed positively, as was its single &quot;On Second Thought&quot;, Rabbitt&#x27;s last number-one hit. The album also included &quot;American Boy&quot;, a patriotic tune popular during the Gulf War and used in Bob Dole&#x27;s 1996 presidential campaign.

Rabbitt was among the many country singers who suffered a dramatic decline in chart success beginning in 1991. That year, he released &quot;Ten Rounds&quot;, which produced the final charting single of his career, &quot;Hang Up the Phone&quot;. Following that release, he left Capitol Records to tour with his band Hare Trigger.

In 1997, Rabbitt signed with Intersound Records, but was soon diagnosed with lung cancer. After a round of chemotherapy, he released the album &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Odds&quot;. In 1998, he released his last studio album, &quot;Songs from Rabbittland&quot;.

==Musical styles==
Rabbitt used innovative techniques to tie country music themes with light rhythm and blues-influenced tempos. His songs often used echo, as Rabbitt routinely sang his own background vocals. In a process called the &quot;Eddie Rabbitt Chorale&quot;, Rabbitt compensated for what &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; described as a &quot;somewhat thin and reedy voice&quot; by recording songs in three-part harmonies. His music was compared to rockabilly, particularly the album &quot;Horizon&quot;, which was noted as having an Elvis-like sound. Rabbitt remarked that he liked &quot;a lot of the old Memphis sounds that came out of Sun Records&quot; during the 1950s, and that he &quot;wanted to catch the magic of a live band.&quot; He credited such wide-ranging artists as Bob Dylan, Steely Dan, Elvis Presley, and Willie Nelson with influencing his works. When putting together an album, Rabbitt tried to make sure he put in &quot;ten potential singles...no fillers, no junk.&quot; He remembered listening to albums as a child and hearing &quot;two hits and a bunch of garbage.&quot;

Rabbitt believed that country music was &quot;Irish music&quot; and that &quot;the minor chords in [his] music gave it that mystical feel.&quot; Although he did not strive to produce pop music, his songs helped influence the direction of country music, leading to the Urban Cowboy era during the 1980s. Critic Harry Sumrall of the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; said that Rabbitt was &quot;like a hot corn dog: nothing fancy, nothing frilly. You know what you&#x27;re getting and you like it...never a country purist, Rabbitt nonetheless makes music that is plain and simple, with all of the virtues that make good country good. [His songs] might be brisk, but they are also warm and familiar, like the breeze that wafts in over the fried artichokes.&quot;

During the early 1990s, Rabbitt voiced criticism of hip hop music, particularly rap, which he said was sending a negative message to youth. He stated that the music was &quot;inciting a generation&quot; and that it had helped to contribute to the high rates of teenaged pregnancy, high-school dropouts, and rapes during this period.

==Personal life==
When Rabbitt arrived in Nashville during the late 1960s, a friend gave him a pet chicken. Rabbitt said he had &quot;an affinity for animals&quot;, and he kept the bird for a while before giving it to a farmer. During his Nashville days in the early 1970s, Rabbitt had a pet monkey, Jojo. Before his &quot;Rocky Mountain Music&quot; tour, the monkey bit Rabbitt, leaving his right arm in bandages.

In 1976, Rabbitt married Janine Girardi, whom he called &quot;a little thing about five feet tall, with long, black beautiful hair, and a real pretty face.&quot; He had previously written the songs &quot;Pure Love&quot; and &quot;Sweet Janine&quot; for her. They had three children, Demelza, Timmy, and Tommy. Timmy was diagnosed with biliary atresia upon birth. The condition required a liver transplant for survival and he underwent one in 1985, but the attempt failed and he died. Rabbitt temporarily put his career on hiatus, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be out of the music business, but where I was more important.&quot; Tommy was born in 1986.

Rabbitt felt his responsibility as an entertainer was to be a good role model and he was an advocate for many charitable organizations, including the Special Olympics, Easter Seals, and the American Council on Transplantation, of which he served as honorary chairman. He also worked as a spokesman for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and United Cerebral Palsy.

Rabbitt was a registered Republican and let Bob Dole use his song &quot;American Boy&quot; during Dole&#x27;s 1996 presidential campaign.

Rabbitt was also a fan of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and visited the set during the show&#x27;s fifth season in 1991–92.

==Death==
Rabbitt, a longtime smoker 
, died on May 7, 1998, in Nashville from lung cancer at the age of 56. He had been diagnosed with the disease in March 1997 and had received radiation treatment and surgery to remove part of one lung. His body was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Nashville on May 8, 1998. 
No media outlets reported the death until after the burial at the family&#x27;s request. The news came as a surprise to many in Nashville, including the performer&#x27;s agent, who &quot;had no idea Eddie was terminal&quot; and had talked to him often, remarking that Rabbitt &quot;was always upbeat and cheerful&quot; in the final months of his life. Although he was widely believed to have been born in 1944 (this year can still be found in older publications and texts), at the time of his death, he was revealed to have been born in 1941.

<text>James Walker Fannin Jr. (January 1, 1804– March 27, 1836) was an American military officer and planter who served in the Texian Army during the Texas Revolution. After being outnumbered and surrendering to the Mexican Army at the Battle of Coleto Creek, Fannin and his fellow prisoners of war were massacred soon afterward at Goliad, Texas, under Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s orders. He was memorialized in several place names, including a military training camp and a major city street in Houston.

==Early life and family==
James Fannin was born on January 1, 1804, in Georgia to Isham Fannin, a plantation owner and veteran of the War of 1812. His mother was not married to his father, and he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, James W. Walker, and raised on a plantation in Marion, Georgia. His ancestors, who spelled the family name Fanning, lived in America during the Revolutionary War, a family with divided loyalties during the conflict. Isham&#x27;s father James W. Fannin dropped the &quot;g&quot; from the family name and settled in Georgia.

He briefly attended the University of Georgia when he was 14, and later enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point on July 1, 1819. He seems to have been academically deficient, and was often tardy or absent from classes, standing sixtieth out of a class of eighty-six. He resigned November 20, 1821 from the school after dueling a fellow cadet.He had received a letter from a cousin urging his immediate return to Georgia to attend to ailing grandparents.

He married Minerva Fort. Their daughter, Missouri Pinckney, was born on July 17, 1829. A second daughter, Minerva, nicknamed Eliza, was born mentally ill in 1832. While living in Columbus, Georgia, he enlisted in the militia and worked as a merchant. In Muscogee County, he was a member of the Temperance Society, master of the local Masonic lodge, and had attempted to become a judge, but was disqualified for his past of dueling. 

==Texas Revolution==

In 1834, Fannin settled his family at Velasco, in Tejas (now Texas), where he owned a slave plantation and was a managing partner in a slave-trading syndicate. By 1835, Fannin was involved in growing the Anglo-American resistance to the Mexican government of Texas. He wrote letters seeking financial assistance and volunteers to help Texas. By September, Fannin was an active member of the Texian Army.

He took part in the Battle of Gonzales on October 2 and urged Stephen F. Austin to send aid to Gonzales. Fannin later worked with James Bowie, First Battalion, First Division, under Austin&#x27;s orders to secure supplies and determine the conditions in and around Gonzales and San Antonio de Bexar:

Under the command of Bowie, Fannin fought in the Battle of Concepción on October 28, 1835.

In November 1835, Austin ordered Fannin and William B. Travis and about 150 men to cut off any Mexican supply party. On November 13, Houston offered Fannin the post of inspector general to the regular army. Fannin wrote back requesting a field appointment of brigadier general and a &quot;post of danger&quot;. On November 22, 1835, Fannin was honorably discharged from the volunteer army by Austin and began campaigning for a larger regular army for Texas. He also went home to spend time with his family.

Sam Houston, supported by Governor Henry Smith, commissioned Fannin as a colonel in the regular army on December 7, 1835. By January 7, 1836, the provisional government had appointed Fannin &quot;military agent&quot;, to answer only to the council and not Houston. He began recruiting forces and supplies for the forthcoming and confusing Matamoros campaign against the Mexican city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Fannin had difficulty leading the volunteers in his charge. He tried to institute regular Army discipline, but his irregular volunteers would not accept it. Many of his men thought he was aloof, and several historians believe that he was an ineffective commander because of it. The majority of the men serving under Fannin had been in Texas only a short time; he was frustrated by this, writing to Lieutenant Governor James W. Robinson &quot;... among the rise of 400 men at, and near this post, I doubt if 25 citizens of Texas can be mustered in the ranks...&quot;.

In early February, Fannin sailed from Velasco and landed at Copano with four companies of the Georgia Battalion, moving to join a small band of Texians at Refugio. Mexican reinforcements under General Jose Urrea arrived at Matamoros, complicating the Texian plans to attack that city. Fannin withdrew 25 miles north to Goliad.

==Failed expedition to support the Alamo and aftermath==

Appeals from Travis at the Alamo (via James Bonham) prompted Fannin to launch a relief march of more than 300 men and four pieces of artillery on February 25, 1836. After some delay, Fannin and his men moved out on the 28th for the journey to San Antonio, a distance of more than 90 miles. The relief mission was a failure. The troops barely had crossed the San Antonio River when wagons broke down, prompting the men to camp within sight of Goliad. They had little or no food, some men were barefooted, and the oxen teams wandered off during the night. On March 6, 1836, the Battle of the Alamo was fought, with all the Alamo&#x27;s defenders (about 187 men) being killed by Mexican forces.

The Mexican forces under General José de Urrea were now rapidly approaching the Texan stronghold in Goliad. They defeated Texian forces at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27, where 20 were killed and prisoners were taken. Frank W. Johnson and four other Texians were captured, but later managed to escape and rejoin James Fannin&#x27;s command at Goliad.

The Battle of Agua Dulce was fought on March 2. Dr. James Grant, Robert C. Morris and 12 others were killed, with prisoners taken. Plácido Benavides and six others escaped to notify Fannin of the situation.

On March 12, Fannin sent Captain Amon B. King and about 28 men to take wagons to Refugio to help evacuate the remaining families. King and his men confronted an advance party of General Urrea&#x27;s cavalry in the Battle of Refugio; his defense failed and he withdrew to the old mission. A local boy managed to get away and alerted Fannin to the skirmish. Fannin sent Lieutenant Colonel William Ward and about 120 men to King&#x27;s aid. Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men.

On March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea&#x27;s larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to Victoria. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria. Other dispatches were intercepted by the Centralista forces, informing them of Fannin&#x27;s plans. Fannin needed means of transport and had sent Albert C. Horton and his men to Victoria, to bring carts and 20 yokes of oxen from Army quartermaster John J. Linn, who did return around March 16. Horton&#x27;s men would later form Fannin&#x27;s advance guard during the retreat to Victoria. Fannin finally received the news of King and Ward&#x27;s defeat from Hugh McDonald Frazer on March 17.

==Battle of Coleto Creek==

On March 19, 1836, Fannin led the Texians on a retreat from Presidio La Bahia, which Fannin had renamed Fort Defiance.

Transporting nine cannons and more than 500 spare muskets, Fannin&#x27;s forces were also heavily laden with supplies and baggage. The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a hollow square with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Urrea&#x27;s forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the Battle of Coleto.

==The Goliad Massacre==

The Mexicans took the Texians back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texians thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Under a decree that Santa Anna had pressed for, and which was passed by the Mexican Congress on December 30, 1835, armed foreigners taken in combat were to be treated as pirates and executed. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texians. Urrea wrote in his diary that he &quot;... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.&quot; On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.

The next day, Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance and shot, clubbed or knifed to death. The 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: that his personal possessions be sent to his family, to be shot in the heart and not the face, and to be given a Christian burial. He was then shot in the face and his body burned along with the other Texians who died that day.

<text>Potong Pasir ( ) is a housing estate located between Toa Payoh and Sennett Estate in the Central Region of Singapore. For urban planning purposes, it is classified under the Toa Payoh area.

Politically, Potong Pasir had been the longest-held opposition ward in one-party dominant Singapore. Its Opposition Member of Parliament Chiam See Tong held the ward from 1984 to 2011. In 2011, the ward, led by Mrs. Lina Chiam, was lost to 3-time challenger Sitoh Yih Pin in what was the slimmest of margins of 114 votes, with 242 votes rejected. Mr. Chiam See Tong led a team of 5 to contest in the Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency (GRC) during that General Elections.

Potong Pasir is accessible by the MRT station on the North East line.

The Potong Pasir Community Club in Potong Pasir hosts facilities such as a multi-purpose hall, activity rooms as well as a KFC outlet. The multi-purpose hall can be used as a badminton court and serves the residents of the state.

There are private houses and condominiums located within the neighbourhood, in Sennett Estate.

==History==
From 1910 to 1937, it was dominated by sand-quarries, hence giving it its present name, which means &#x27;cut sand&#x27; in Malay. These mining activities created four ponds linked to the Kallang River, although they were reduced to two due to massive flooding in 1968. The ponds provided a good source of food for the local monkeys, until pollution set in later.

In the mid 1950s, Potong Pasir was one of the most important vegetable growing areas in Singapore. The land here had been cultivated since the 1830s. The farmers there were almost all Cantonese and they used traditional methods with great success.

Leafy vegetables were grown on farms located in lowland areas such as Potong Pasir, Changi, Ponggol, and Sembawang. Watercress was the most important type of vegetable grown in Potong Pasir. A small portion of farmland was used for planting coconut palms.

Vegetable farming in Singapore was a family business. Farmers of Potong Pasir lived in attap houses, in zinc roof and semi-concrete houses. The general condition of the rural roads was poor. Most farmers in the area leased their land from the Government.

During the early years, Potong Pasir was also a site of regular flooding. Villagers would take refuge in nearby St Andrew&#x27;s School, which was on Woodsville Hill.

Rapid change took place for the past five decades, with the building of a bridge across the ponds in the 1950s, a venue for education introduced in the form of a village community centre in 1952, piped water and electricity in the 1960s, and by the 1970s, most of the villagers had already started to move out as the land was acquired by the government for massive redevelopment.

Hence, a public housing estate, Potong Pasir Estate, began to take shape in the 1980s, with construction commencing in 1982, and the first blocks completed two years later. The sloping roof of some blocks became the most recognisable icon of Potong Pasir. From then till now, the ward has managed to retain its idyllic feel even as the pace of urbanisation has caught up with other areas.

Historically, a road called &quot;Jalan Potong Pasir&quot; used to cut through the area. This historic road has since ceased to exist, but it defined the lines of the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency as it started the current Lorong 8 Toa Payoh at Braddell Road and ending at Potong Pasir Avenue 1 at Upper Serangoon Road.

==Political history==
Potong Pasir was formed in the 1968 election on its redistricting from its former Aljunied Constituency, and has remained as a SMC since its presence as of the recent 2020 General Elections. Its current Member of Parliament is People&#x27;s Action Party&#x27;s Sitoh Yih Pin, who served this constituency since 2011. Its Town Council was standalone as a SMC until 2015 where it was now part of the Jalan Besar Town Council, with Jalan Besar GRC.

The constituency was famous for being its former opposition stronghold where then-longest serving opposition Member of Parliament (MP) and Secretary-General of the Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) (previously Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) until 1994, and part of Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) between 2001 and 2010), Chiam See Tong, was an MP in his constituency for 26 years, which back then, sets a record for its longest tenure of any opposition party at 26 years from 1984 to 2011 (the record has since superseded by Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s currently-held stronghold of Hougang, which was claimed in 1991 and had broken the record in 2017). After Chiam vacated his seat to contest in the neighboring Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency in 2011, his wife Lina Loh was named the successor; however, neither Chiam&#x27;s team nor his wife Loh were successful, with the latter being unsuccessful in defending the constituency despite a razor-thin margin.

==Schools==
Potong Pasir estate is home to St Andrew&#x27;s Village, a cluster of schools part of The Saints Family. It comprises St Andrew&#x27;s Junior School, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior College; together forming St. Andrew&#x27;s School. The name of the school is usually abbreviated as SA or SAS. Its students and alumni (&#x27;Old Boys&#x27; and &#x27;Old Girls&#x27;) are referred to as Saints.

In the 2000s, as part of the St Andrew&#x27;s Village project, all three schools were planned to reunite in Potong Pasir. Renovation and expansion of the Junior School started in 2003, and the new buildings opened in December 2004. Construction of a new Secondary School started in 2003, opposite the Junior School along Francis Thomas Drive, and opened in December 2004. Construction of the Junior College started in June 2003 after the Secondary School vacated the site and shifted to its holding location. The Junior College opened in December 2005 and a ceremony was held to mark its return to Potong Pasir. The Village was officially opened on 26 August 2006, with the ceremony being held at the 1000-seater Cultural Centre in the Junior College.

==Folklore==
In the 1880s, Miss Gaurav Beesoony (GAH-RAH-FF BEE-SUU-NI) was a homeless man who suffered from severe schizophrenia and autism. Gaurav was known for his bigoted nature and delusions of being a woman. In 1889, Miss Gaurav Beesoony was reported missing from the monkey enclosure in the Singapore Zoo. According to The Straits Times, Gaurav was found to have been decapitated in a planter in Potong Pasir after a year of searching. The police found no foul play, and ruled his death under self-infliction. The spirit of Gaurav “黑自闭症” (Black Autism in Mandarin) is believed to curse young children with his monkeypox and autism, making him one of the most feared urban legends in Potong Pasir.

In the 1940s, Kieran Soh Rui Xiang was a student in St Andrew’s Junior School and was known to be ‘short and thin’. One evening, Kieran had still not reached home. Concerned for her son’s safety, Kieran’s adoptive mother reported her missing child to the police. After searching, the police found Kieran’s unconscious body in the Kallang River. Although Kieran’s face was reportedly half consumed by the river’s ecosystem, he was identifiable by his school uniform. Foul play was suspected, however, no evidence proved this suspicion. The motive behind Kieran’s untimely death remains unknown. Residents residing near the Kallang River claim to have seen a silhouette of a young child lurking around the river, and even wailing during the night. The residents of Potong Pasir believe that this perceived being is the spirit of Kieran Soh Rui Xiang. However, since Kieran’s spirit was considered to be generally passive, People soon neglected him.

<doc id="1147594" wikidata="Q205993" url="?curid=1147594" title="William Gopallawa">
<text>William Gopallawa (, ; 17 September 1896 – 31 January 1981) was a Sri Lankan politician and statesman who served as the last Governor-General of Ceylon from 1962 to 1972 and the first and only non-executive President of Sri Lanka from 1972 to 1978, when Ceylon declared itself a republic and changed its name to Sri Lanka.

Gopallawa served as Governor-General during the tenure of three different governments, two headed by Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the SLFP and one headed by Dudley Senanayake of the UNP.

== Early life and education==
William Gopallawa was born on 17 September 1896 at the Dullewe Maha Walauwa, Dullewe, Aluvihare, a suburb of Matale. He was related to Dullewe Dissava, a signatory on behalf of the Sinhalese to the Kandiyan Convention of 1815, by his mother Tikiri Kumarihamy Dullewe. His father, Tikiri Bandara Gopallawa died when he was three years old.

He received his primary education at the Dullewe village school and at St. John&#x27;s College, Kandy. He continued his secondary education at Dharmaraja College, Kandy where he was a Scout and later moved to St. Anthony&#x27;s College, Kandy. After having sat the Cambridge Senior Certificate Examination in 1917, he returned to Matale and joined as one of the tutorial staff of the Buddhist English School and was also instrumental in setting up a library and a Scout troop for the benefit of the students there.

== Legal career ==
In 1920, Gopallawa joined the Ceylon Law College, Colombo and was enrolled as a Proctor and Notary Public in 1924. He started his legal practice as a junior to Bernard Aluwihare in the unofficial bar of Kandy and went on to develop a practice in Matale, Dumbara and Kandy from 1924 until he took up duties as Municipal Commissioner, Kandy in 1939. He continued his practice on and off until he became the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council.

== Political career ==
In 1926, Gopallawa contested and won in the Matale Urban Council Elections and served continuously in the council for a period of 13 years from 1926 to 1939. He served as the chairman of the Matale Urban Council for 5 years, at his office he was the youngest Urban Council Chairman in Ceylon at that time. In 1936, Gopallawa unsuccessfully contested for the Matale seat at the State Council Elections in 1936. In 1939, the Kandy Municipal Council was established and Gopallawa was appointed as the first Municipal Commissioner of Kandy. He served in that capacity throughout World War II and acquitted himself for efficiency during the great floods in 1950. In 1951, he was appointed as Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council and served until 1957, when he stepped down from the post. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

== Diplomatic role ==
On 18 June 1958 when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike&#x27;s government started diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Gopallawa was posted as the second Ambassador to China in 1960. On 7 September 1961, while he was serving in China, he was recalled and posted as the Ambassador to the United States; he served there until 1962.

== Governor-General of Ceylon and President of Sri Lanka ==
In 1962, he was called back to Ceylon, after his son in law&#x27;s sister, the then prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike nominated Gopallawa as Governor-General of Ceylon following Sir Oliver Goonetilleke&#x27;s implication in the attempted military coup earlier that year. He was the second native Ceylonese Governor-General and the first Buddhist to hold the post as the viceregal representative of Queen Elizabeth II who was the head of state. Gopallawa served in this capacity until 1972, when he became the first President of Sri Lanka.

His constitutional decision to invite the UNP which won the majority of parliamentary seats in the 1965 general election, (but not enough for an absolute majority) is heralded as a landmark moment where he respected the nation&#x27;s constitution and its people&#x27;s wishes more than the wishes of the defeated SLFP government who had first appointed him, who wanted him to delay inviting the winning party to form the government. It averted a major crisis of leadership.

When Ceylon became the Republic of Sri Lanka on 22 May 1972, Gopallawa became the first president. Like the governor-general&#x27;s post it replaced, the presidency was largely ceremonial. He stepped down from office in February 1978 when then Prime Minister Junius Richard Jayewardene became president following constitutional changes that effected the creation of an executive presidency.

== Faith ==
While he was a devout Buddhist, he respected all faiths and never failed to attend the annual Vel Hindu ceremony and never failed to host Christmas carols and also attended various Muslim ceremonies in his role as titular head of state; he was acutely cognizant of his role as a unifier of all Sri Lankans during his tenure. He was the first to establish a spartan Buddhist shrine room at the President&#x27;s House.

== Family ==
On 8 March 1928, Gopallawa married Seelawathie Rambukwella; they had 5 children. He was survived by 4 children out of 5. One died early on while he was still working in Matale. His eldest daughter Chandrika Iranganie married Dr. Mackie Ratwatte, the private secretary and a brother of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. His oldest son Asoka is an entrepreneur businessman, His second daughter Chinthamani, was a teacher and landed proprietor, and his youngest son Monty Gopallawa who died in 2005, was a member of parliament and an affable cabinet minister in the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga (daughter of Sirimavo Bandaranaike). He had 13 grandchildren; Chandhaka, Dhammika, Mano, Anushka, Devika, Avanthi, Sureka, Lehka, Shiranthani, Ashani, Mahen, Shanika and Dilani, and 1 known great-great-grandchild, named Vonal Gopallawa.

== Honours ==
* Member of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1953
* LLD (Honoris Causa) from the University of Ceylon in 1962
* LLD from the Vidyalankara in 1962

<doc id="1147605" wikidata="Q5039351" url="?curid=1147605" title="Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act">
<text>The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) is a United States legislative act signed into law on May 18, 2000 by President Bill Clinton as part of the Trade and Development Act of 2000. This latter act, which also included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA), was intended to advance U.S. economic and security interests by strengthening American relationships with other regions of the world then viewed to be making significant strides in terms of economic development and political reform.

The 23 independent countries of the Caribbean basin region together form the sixth largest export market for U.S. goods, totaling $19 billion and absorbing 2.7 percent of U.S. exports in 1999. However, the devastation of hurricanes Mitch and Georges in 1998 set the regional economy back. In addition, the U.S.&#x27;s signing of the NAFTA with Mexico in 1994 had caused Caribbean basin countries to lose the preferential treatment they had previously enjoyed.

The CBTPA, an expansion of the 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), sought to address those issues. In particular, the CBTPA extended preferential tariff treatment to textile and apparel products assembled from U.S. fabric that were previously excluded from the program. American policy makers hoped that this would encourage additional U.S. exports of cotton and yarn and U.S. investment in the region, thereby improving the global competitive position of the U.S. textile industry.

The CBTPA was also intended to encourage the diversification of CBI countries’ economies, viewed by American policymakers as a key step towards economic development that would decrease the region&#x27;s dependence on aid and reduce illegal immigration into the United States as well as the trafficking of illegal drugs. American lawmakers also hoped that CBTPA would send a signal to the other countries of the Caribbean basin and elsewhere of American commitment to promoting trade-expanding policies.

<text>Whiskey Tango Ghosts is the third solo album by Tanya Donelly, released in 2004. The album marks a departure from Donelly&#x27;s previous pop work in favor of a country and folk-influenced sound. Donelly has described the album as influenced by &quot;a horrible war, a horrible administration, (and) a bleak, mean winter.&quot;

<doc id="1147618" wikidata="Q1521617" url="?curid=1147618" title="Si Lom Road">
<text>Si Lom Road (also written as Silom, , ) is a major street in the Thai capital Bangkok, best known for its commercial neighbourhood, which, along with the nearby and roughly parallel Sathon Road, forms one of the city&#x27;s main business districts. It runs in a southwest–northeast direction between Charoen Krung and Rama IV roads in the city&#x27;s Bang Rak District, forming the boundary between Suriyawong Subdistrict to its north and Si Lom Subdistrict to its south. Si Lom was one of the earliest modern roads to be built in the city, and some of its side streets serve historic ethnic neighbourhoods from the late nineteenth century, while others are known as shopping and nightlife venues.

==History==

In the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV, 1851–1868), Siam (as Thailand was then known) began modernizing and opening up to the West. Major roads were first built in Bangkok, with Thanon Trong (what is now Rama IV Road) built together with a canal in 1857, followed by Charoen Krung Road (popularly considered the first modern road in the country) in 1862, both in response to requests by Western consuls and merchants. Around the same time, the King had a canal dug from the French Consulate to the canal of Thanon Trong, linking the latter to the Chao Phraya River via the existing Bang Rak Canal. The dredged earth was used to build a road, running alongside the canal on its southern bank and linking Charoen Krung and Trong roads. The King also solicited contributions from wealthy property owners, who helped build bridges over canals crossed by the road.

The new canal and road were initially known as Khlong Khwang and Thanon Khwang (&#x27;crossing canal&#x27;/&#x27;crossing road&#x27;). They later became known as Si Lom, which literally translates as &quot;windmill&quot;, probably from a windmill erected in the area by a Western entrepreneur; the road was referred to as Windmill Road in English-language sources until the 1930s.

Areas along the road initially developed agriculturally, attracting a variety of ethnic communities. In the 1890s and 1900s, enterprising developers built roads and canals parallel to Si Lom (Sathon Road to the south, and Surawong and Si Phraya to the north), and the area that is now Bang Rak District became served by a network of roads, attracting businesses as well as wealthy residents. Religious institutions were established along the road, serving Western expatriates as well as settlers from Western colonies. A tram line running alone the road began operation in 1925. The area gradually saw increasing development, which sharply accelerated in the 1960s. In 1963, the trams were discontinued and the canal filled in for the road&#x27;s expansion, further incentivizing its development as a business street. The Dusit Thani Hotel, the city&#x27;s first high-rise building, opened at the road&#x27;s Rama IV end in 1970, and a wave of high-rise construction followed, especially from the 1980s to early 1990s as Bangkok underwent rapid economic growth which ended with the 1997 financial crisis. The BTS Skytrain, opened in 1999, now runs above the eastern half of the road&#x27;s length, and Si Lom and Sathon continue to be known as one of the main business districts of Bangkok.

==Neighbourhoods==
Si Lom Road runs from Sala Daeng Intersection at its eastern end—where it meets Rama IV and Ratchadamri roads—west and slightly south to Bang Rak Junction, where it meets Charoen Krung Road. Around mid-way, it is crossed by Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Road, a major thoroughfare which leads southeast to Sathon and onwards. Most of the road is fronted by commercial establishments, with its eastern half in particular lined by towering office blocks and luxury hotels, while several distinctive neighbourhoods are nestled along its side streets (&quot;soi&quot;).

On the road&#x27;s north side (in Suriyawong Subdistrict), some of the even-numbered &quot;soi&quot;, as well as a few named streets, link it to Surawong. Near the Sala Daeng end, the streets serve a concentration of nightlife venues, and blend into the tourist-oriented red-light district of Patpong, while Thaniya (, also spelled Taniya) is known as a hub of Japanese establishments. On the opposite side, Sala Daeng and Convent roads link to Sathon, and are home to restaurants and cafes, as well as Saint Joseph Convent School and the Carmelite Monastery. Nearby odd-numbered &quot;soi&quot; include Soi 5 or Soi Lalai Sap, a popular shopping street.

Past Si Lom–Naradhiwas intersection, the road becomes quieter, and a few old ethnic cemeteries remain on its southern side, especially along Soi 9. Towards Bang Rak Junction to the west, the neighbourhood is home to a significant Tamil Indian community, and the Hindu Sri Mahamariamman Temple, whose Navaratri celebrations are a major annual event on Si Lom, forms major landmark here. The temple sits on the corner of Pan Road (), which links to Sathon and is also known as Soi Wat Khaek ( &#x27;Indian temple street&#x27;) after the temple. The street is officially named after Pan Watcharapai née Na Songkhla (), who was the wife of Luang Uppakankosakon () and provided the land for its construction. On the road are vendors selling &quot;modak&quot;, shops selling offerings for Ganesh, restaurants, cafés, bars and galleries. The area around Mahesak Road (between Si Lom and Surawong) is also known as a jewellery district.

On the corner of Bang Rak Junction, the gigantic State Tower building towers over the neighbourhood and the next-door Lerdsin Hospital. (Bangkok Christian Hospital is another major hospital on the street.) Other significant buildings include the nearby Jewelry Trade Center, and King Power Mahanakhon on Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Road. The 1981 headquarters building of Bangkok Bank is iconic for its pioneering application of modernist design to a concrete high-rise building, while other major corporations based on Si Lom include Thailand&#x27;s largest conglomerate Charoen Pokphand and other financial institutions, leading Si Lom to be known as the &quot;Wall Street of Thailand&quot;. The areas along Si Lom command some of the highest land prices in the country, with official appraisals for 2016–2020 ranging from 700,000 to 1,000,000 baht per square wa (US$). The BTS serves the area via its Sala Daeng and Chong Nonsi stations, with the former also connecting to the Si Lom Station of the MRT&#x27;s Blue Line.

<text>Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure&#x27;s support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions.

Boo was one of the three scripting languages for the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies employed De Oliveira, its designer), until official support was dropped in 2014 due to the small userbase. The Boo Compiler was removed from the engine in 2017. Boo has since been abandoned by De Oliveira, with development being taken over by Mason Wheeler.

Boo is free software released under the BSD 3-Clause license. It is compatible with the Microsoft .NET and Mono frameworks.

<doc id="1147630" wikidata="Q2630137" url="?curid=1147630" title="Buichi Terasawa">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist. His most famous works include &quot;Goku Midnight Eye&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Terasawa was born on March 30, 1955, in Asahikawa, Hokkaido. In the early days of his career, while still unknown, he contributed comics to a magazine that won him a prize. This event led him deeper into the world of comics.

In 1976 he moved to Tokyo and began to study under renowned Japanese manga artist, Osamu Tezuka. During the period he worked with the Manga Department of Tezuka Productions, his illustration work entitled &quot;Mother Earth, Turn Green Again&quot; was awarded the Tezuka Award. In 1977, he began drawing for &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, a popular Japanese manga magazine.

From around the beginning of the 1980s, he began to see the personal computer as a tool for creative purposes. In 1985, he kicked off an eight-color comic book series called &quot;BAT&quot;. In the ensuing years, in parallel with advances in the personal computer, he created &quot;TAKERU&quot; (1992), the world&#x27;s first computer graphics comic book series.

Next came &quot;Cobra&quot;, &quot;Bat&quot; and &quot;Gundragon Sigma&quot; (in this latter series, only the main character is drawn by hand) and several other works.

His works include original works, scenarios and works he has directed. Representative works include a CD-ROM format work for use with a PC, &quot;COBRA II: A Man of Legend&quot; and original animation videos such as &quot;GOKU&quot;, &quot;GOKU II&quot;, &quot;Raven Tengu Kabuto&quot; and others.

Buichi Terasawa&#x27;s works are translated and published in more than ten countries and are featured in comics and animation-related gatherings and exhibitions around the world.

Whilst in Japan promoting &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, Luc Besson met with Terasawa to discuss the current state of sci-fi. Besson is reputedly a fan of Terasawa&#x27;s work, partially due to the enormous popularity of &quot;Space Cobra&quot; in France.

== Illness and death ==
Terasawa was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in 1998, and despite surgery and chemotherapy, he relapsed and after surgery was left paralysed on the left side of his body. Terasawa died from a heart attack on September 8, 2023, at the age of 68.

<doc id="1147636" wikidata="Q2574486" url="?curid=1147636" title="Battle of Goliad">
<text>The Battle of Goliad was the second skirmish of the Texas Revolution. In the early-morning hours of October 9, 1835, Texas settlers attacked the Mexican Army soldiers garrisoned at Presidio La Bahía, a fort near the Mexican Texas settlement of Goliad. La Bahía lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers (at Presidio San Antonio de Béxar) and the then-important Texas port of Copano.

In September, Texians began plotting to kidnap Mexican General Martín Perfecto de Cos, who was en route to Goliad to attempt to quell the unrest in Texas. The plan was initially dismissed by the central committee coordinating the rebellion. However, within days of the Texian victory at the Battle of Gonzales, Captain George Collinsworth and members of the Texian militia in Matagorda began marching towards Goliad. The Texians soon learned that Cos and his men had already departed for San Antonio de Béxar but continued their march.

The garrison at La Bahía was understaffed and could not mount an effective defense of the fort&#x27;s perimeter. Using axes borrowed from townspeople, Texians were able to chop through a door and enter the complex before the bulk of the soldiers were aware of their presence. After a half an hour battle, the Mexican garrison, under Colonel Juan López Sandoval, surrendered. One Mexican soldier had been killed and three others wounded, while only one Texian, Samuel McCulloch Jr. had been injured. The majority of the Mexican soldiers were instructed to leave Texas, and the Texians confiscated $10,000 worth of provisions and several cannons, which they soon transported to the Texian Army for use in the siege of Béxar. The victory isolated Cos&#x27;s men in Béxar from the coast, forcing them to rely on a long overland march to request or receive reinforcements or supplies.

==Background==

In 1835, Mexico operated two major garrisons within its Texas territory, the Alamo at San Antonio de Béxar and Presidio La Bahía near Goliad. Béxar was the political center of Texas, and Goliad laid halfway between it and the major Texas port of Copano. Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to Copano Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements.

In early 1835, as the Mexican government transitioned from a federalist model to centralism, wary colonists in Texas began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in San Felipe de Austin coordinated their activities. The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June; these Anahuac Disturbances prompted Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna to send additional troops to Texas. In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle, led 200 men to reinforce Presidio La Bahía. The following month, a contingent of soldiers arrived in Béxar with Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea. Fearing that stronger measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to &quot;repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, are pushing forward with a desire to live at their own option without subjection to the laws&quot;. Cos landed at Copano Bay on September 20 with approximately 500 soldiers. Cos briefly toured the port at Copano Bay and the small garrison at nearby Refugio and left small groups of soldiers to reinforce each of these locations. The main body of soldiers arrived in Goliad on October 2.

Unbeknownst to Cos, as early as September 18, several Texians, including James Fannin, Philip Dimmitt, and John Lin, had independently begun advocating a plan to seize Cos at either Copano or Goliad. As soon as Cos&#x27;s warships were spotted approaching Copano Bay, Refugio colonists sent messengers to San Felipe de Austin and Matagorda to inform the other settlements of Cos&#x27;s imminent arrival. Concerned that a lack of artillery would make the presidio at Goliad impossible to capture, the central committee chose not to order an assault.

Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn continued to push for an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where a small group of Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.

==Prelude==

On October 6, members of the Texian militia in Matagorda convened at the home of Sylvanus Hatch. As their first order of business they elected George Collinsworth as their captain; Dr. William Carleton was then named first lieutenant and D.C. Collinsworth became the unit&#x27;s second lieutenant. After appointing their leaders, the men decided to march on La Bahía. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. The Texians sent messengers to alert nearby settlements of their quest. By afternoon, 50 Texians were ready to march from Matagorda. During the march, for unknown reasons the men fired Carleton and appointed James W. Moore as the new first lieutenant.

The following day the expedition stopped at Victoria, where they were soon joined by English-speaking settlers from other settlements and 30 Tejanos led by Plácido Benavides. Although no accurate muster rolls were kept, historian Stephen Hardin estimated that the Texian ranks swelled to 125 men. Forty-nine of them signed a &quot;Compact of Volunteers under Collinsworth&quot; on October 9. These men pledged that they were loyal to the Mexican federal government and would harm no one who remained loyal to the federalist cause.

One of the new arrivals, merchant Philip Dimmitt, received a missive from the Goliad customs agent with news that Cos and his war chest had already departed La Bahía to travel to San Antonio de Béxar. Undeterred, the group marched out on October 9. Ira Ingram led the vanguard, which halted outside Goliad. The events that follow are not very clear. According to the memoirs of Mexican General Vicente Filisola, who was not in Texas in 1835, the Texians plotted to draw the presidio commander, Colonel Juan López Sandoval, and his officers from the fort. The Texians allegedly planned a dance in Goliad on October 9 and invited the Mexican officers. Although Sandoval, Captain Manuel Sabriego, and Lieutenant Jesus de la Garza briefly attended the dance, they suspected mischief and returned to the fort. No Texian source mentions such a plot. Several of the Texians, including Dimmitt, did enter the town that evening to try to find guides and support for the effort. Dimmitt&#x27;s efforts were successful, and several of the Tejanos who lived near Goliad joined the Texian force. They reported that Sandoval commanded only 50 men—far fewer than the number necessary to defend the entire perimeter of the fort—and provided directions to the fort.

The main body of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented in the dark and wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a mesquite thicket. While working their way back towards the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.

==Battle==
As the combined Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the &quot;alcalde&quot; of the city to surrender. At 11 pm, the &quot;alcade&quot; responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.

The Mexican soldiers opened fire, hitting Samuel McCulloch Jr., a former slave whom George Collinsworth had freed, in the shoulder. Texians returned fire for approximately 30 minutes. During a pause in the fighting, a Texian spokesman yelled out that they would &quot;massacre everyone of you, unless you come out immediately and surrender&quot;. The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered.

==Aftermath==
McCulloch was the only Texian soldier to be wounded, and he later claimed to be the &quot;first whose blood was shed in the Texas War for Independence&quot;. This distinction earned him a permanent home; a later law prohibited any freed slave from residing in the Republic of Texas, but in 1840 the Texas legislature specifically excluded McCulloch, his family, and his descendants from its enforcement. The exclusion was reward for McCulloch&#x27;s service and his injury.

Estimates of Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20 soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, on the condition that they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.

Texian troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort. Although they found 300 muskets, most of them were broken and unable to be repaired. Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths who were able to bring the remaining weapons into service. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at US$10,000. The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175 barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, whiskey, and rum. For the next three months, the provisions were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army. The Texians also gained control of several cannons.

Over the next several days, more and more Texian settlers joined the group at La Bahía. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100 men remain at Goliad, under the command of Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos&#x27;s troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.

The loss of Goliad meant that Cos lost his means of communicating with Copano Bay, the closest port to Béxar. The Mexican troops garrisoned at Béxar would now need to get supplies and reinforcements overland.

<doc id="1147643" wikidata="Q1278223" url="?curid=1147643" title="Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959–1963)">
<text>The Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL) was a minor professional ice hockey league that operated primarily in Ontario and Quebec from 1959 to 1963.

While the NHL had established working relationships with teams in leagues such as the AHL and WHL, these leagues and their teams were not fully under the control of the NHL, and in this era they operated more independently than is the case today. The Eastern Professional Hockey League was created in 1959 as the first farm league fully run and controlled by the NHL. While the league proved to be a success on the ice, it largely failed off the ice. Attendance in these smaller cities could not support professional hockey, and by 1962, the league was reduced to just four teams. While the intent was for the EPHL to be the primary development league for the NHL, the Detroit Red Wings did not participate until the final season, and the Toronto Maple Leafs never had an affiliate.

During its final season the league played an interlocking schedule with the International Hockey League. Following the demise of the EPHL, the NHL created the new Central Hockey League of minor-pro farm teams in larger, midwestern U.S. cities. Four of the CHL&#x27;s initial five franchises were relocations of the previous season&#x27;s EPHL teams.

<doc id="1147647" wikidata="Q1435473" url="?curid=1147647" title="Body count">
<text>A body count is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of death squads or serial killers.

The military gathers such figures for a variety of reasons, such as determining the need for continuing operations, estimating efficiency of new and old weapons systems, and planning follow-up operations.

The term has since been used to describe the number of sexual partners a person has engaged with.

==Military use==

&quot;Body count&quot; figures have a long history in military planning and propaganda.

===Sassanian Empire===
According to Procopius, when the Persians were about to march to a war, the king would sit on the throne and many baskets would be set before him. The men of the army would pass along the baskets one by one, each throwing one arrow in the baskets, which would then be sealed with the king&#x27;s seal. When the army returned to Persia, each man would take an arrow from the baskets, and the number of casualties would be determined by the number of remaining arrows.

===The Holocaust===

During the Holocaust in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other eastern areas, killing was done by Nazi Germany&#x27;s military police forces, including &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, the SD, and Wehrmacht police battalions, in massacres by shooting the victims. Such units measured their progress by counting the number of people killed. And the number of killed people was 1.5 million Jews. These murder operations took place under the guise of anti-partisan warfare, but in reality few of those killed were actually partisans.

===Vietnam War===
Since the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically &quot;held&quot; already. Instead, the U.S. Army used body counts to show that the U.S. was winning the war, leading to falsified and inflated enemy body count numbers. The Army&#x27;s theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the attrition warfare.

Historian Christian Appy states &quot;search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress&quot; in the US strategy of attrition. Search and destroy was a term to describe operations aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while body count was the measuring stick for operation success. Appy claims that American commanders exaggerated body counts by 100 percent. This method was controversial, due to two issues. The first is regarding the counting of unarmed civilians killed in actions as enemy combatants in free-fire zone as it was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN battle operations were miscounted as &quot;enemy KIA&quot;. Another issue is inflation and fabrication of body count in after-action reports, which is reported to have given false and inaccurate casualty figures for enemy dead.

===Rhodesian Bush War===

During the Rhodesian Bush War the Rhodesian Security Forces were focused on achieving a high &#x27;kill rate&#x27; against the communist guerrilla forces. While this motivated the Rhodesian personnel to kill large numbers of guerrillas, it may have led them to attack civilians and murder prisoners. The emphasis on the &#x27;kill rate&#x27; may have partly been the result of the influence of American and Australian Vietnam War veterans who volunteered to fight for Rhodesia.

===Iraq War===

In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US military adopted an official policy of not counting deaths. General Tommy Franks&#x27; statement that &quot;we don&#x27;t do body counts&quot; was widely reported. Critics claimed that Franks was only attempting to evade bad publicity, while supporters pointed to the failure of body counts to give an accurate impression of the state of the war in Vietnam. At the end of October 2005, it became public that the US military had been counting Iraqi fatalities since January 2004 but only those killed by insurgents and not those killed by the US forces.

== Slang usage ==
The term &quot;body count&quot; has been used as a euphemistic slang term for how many people one has had sex with. This usage gained further popularity in 2020 on the social media app TikTok, where users would ask strangers what their &quot;body count&quot; was.

<text>The 2000 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], announced in January 2001, was the eighth such countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J. As in previous years, a CD featuring 37 (not necessarily the top 37) songs was released. The CD featured Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s song &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; despite it not making the top 100.

==Full list==

==Artists with multiple entries==
== Countries Represented ==
==Trivia==

* Scoring songs at #1 and #3, Powderfinger set the current record for best performing pair of songs (ranked by adding their positions). This record was to be equaled by Kings of Leon in 2008. The Offspring held the previous record, with songs at #3 and #4 in 1994. 
** Powderfinger also became the only act at that point to top the countdown twice, after &quot;These Days&quot; topped the 1999 list. Flume would later equal this record after winning the 2016 and 2022 countdowns.
** Furthermore, Powderfinger the first artist to feature in the top 10 of an annual countdown for three years in a row (1998–2000), and the first artist since The Cranberries (1993–94) to finish in the top 3 for the second year in a row. Both of these records would later be broken by Billie Eilish and Spacey Jane in 2021 and 2022 respectively. 
* &quot;Thank You (for Loving Me at My Worst)&quot; by The Whitlams also featured in the 1999 Hottest 100 at #54, as did &quot;Mutha Fukka on a Motorcycle&quot; by Machine Gun Fellatio at #59.
* Bomfunk MC&#x27;s is the first artist from Finland to appear in the Hottest 100. 
* Dave Grohl made his ninth consecutive appearance in the Hottest 100, having featured in every annual countdown to date. 
** Regurgitator made their sixth consecutive appearance, having appeared since 1995. 
** Metallica, Powderfinger, Rage Against the Machine, The Whitlams all made their fifth consecutive appearance, having appeared since 1996.

<doc id="1147681" wikidata="Q144792" url="?curid=1147681" title="Topanga, California">
<text>Topanga (Tongva: &quot;Topaa&#x27;nga&quot;) is an unincorporated community in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. Located in the Santa Monica Mountains, the community exists in Topanga Canyon and the surrounding hills. The narrow southern portion of Topanga at the coast is between the city of Malibu and the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Topanga as a census-designated place (CDP). As of the 2020 census the population of the Topanga CDP was 8,560. The ZIP code is 90290 and the area code is primarily 310, with 818 only at the north end of the canyon. It is in the 3rd County Supervisorial district.

Topanga is the largest unincorporated area in Los Angeles County by area, although a majority of it is undeveloped. In 2025, the Palisades Fire partially devastated Topanga with most structures in the lower half portion destroyed.

==History==

&quot;Topanga&quot; is the name given to the area by the Native American indigenous Tongva tribe, and may mean &quot;where the mountain meets the sea&quot; or &quot;a place above.&quot; The name in the Tongva language, &quot;Topaa&#x27;nga&quot;, has a root that likely comes from the Chumash language. It was the western border of their territory, abutting the Chumash tribe that occupied the coast from Malibu northwards. Bedrock mortars can be found carved into rock outcroppings in many locations.

Topanga was then colonized by Mexicans in 1839. In the 1920s, Topanga Canyon became a weekend getaway for Hollywood stars with several cottages built for that purpose. The rolling hills and ample vegetation served to provide both privacy and attractive surroundings for the rich and famous. During the 1960s, Topanga Canyon became a magnet to many new artists. 

In 1965, Wallace Berman settled in the area. For a time, Neil Young lived in Topanga, first living with producer David Briggs then later buying his own house. He recorded most of his &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; album in his basement studio in 1970. Charles Manson had previously been living in Topanga, where he had briefly befriended both Neil Young and Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Members of the Manson Family began their campaign of murder on July 31, 1969, with the murder of Topanga resident Gary Hinman, a music teacher who had opened his home to anyone needing shelter.

On Monday January 10, 2005, a 25-foot, 300-ton boulder rolled down a hillside and landed in Topanga Canyon Blvd. It occurred after heavy rains with photos of the boulder in the news internationally. The boulder blocked traffic for most of that week cutting off thru traffic between the San Fernando Valley and the Pacific Coast Highway. 6-foot holes were drilled into the boulder, then low-yield explosives were used to partially blow up the boulder. A previous attempt with dynamite failed due to heavy saturation from rain.

In January 2025, the series of the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, particularly the Palisades fire has devastated the lower portion of the community, with most homes near the Topanga State Beach destroyed including Topanga Ranch Motel, and the Topanga State Park. Most of the community is placed under an evacuation order despite the community not fully devastated. 

==Geography==
===Topanga Canyon===

Topanga Creek drains Topanga Canyon and is the third largest watershed entering the Santa Monica Bay. The creek is one of the few remaining undammed waterways in the area, and is a spawning ground for steelhead trout. The area typically receives about of rain annually. Topanga Beach lies on the coast at the outlet of Topanga Creek. Topanga Canyon Boulevard, State Route 27, is the principal thoroughfare, connecting the Ventura Freeway (US 101) to the north with Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on the south. The southern portion of the boulevard largely follows Topanga Creek. North of the Old Topanga Canyon Road intersection, the boulevard traverses the Santa Monica Mountains.

Topanga Canyon contains lands of Topanga State Park, the largest park in the Santa Monica Mountains and one of the largest open space preserves surrounded by a city in the world, as well as the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. It is part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. It primarily represents a California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion, with large areas of the California oak woodland plant community, and a wide variety of native plants.

===Climate===

==Lower Topanga Canyon==
The bottom of Topanga Canyon, where it meets Pacific Coast Highway and Topanga Beach, was owned for many years by the Los Angeles Athletic Club, a wealthy private club in downtown Los Angeles. The parcel was rented out to a variety of businesses and residents for decades at remarkably low rents, considering that it borders the city of Malibu. Thus Lower Topanga became unique as one of the last outposts of the classic Topanga Canyon bohemian hippie lifestyle.

The Chumash people considered Lower Topanga a sacred, economic, and cultural meeting place for tribes all along the coast. One of the main neighborhoods, the &quot;Rodeo Grounds&quot;, takes its name from an actual rodeo arena that existed there on a Mexican ranch in the 1800s.

In the early 1900s, Lower Topanga was a Japanese fishing village. William Randolph Hearst owned the property for a time and turned it into a weekend getaway spot with beach shacks for his and Marion Davies&#x27; guests.

In the &#x27;60s, a lively community of artists and surfers sprang up in Lower Topanga. They maintained their houses without assistance, sometimes digging them out of the mud after floods or setting backfires to prevent a spreading wildfire from burning down their neighborhood. The roads remained unpaved.

In 2001, Lower Topanga was sold to California State Parks. Even though the Lower Topanga community occupied less than 2% of the total purchased land, State Parks had an aggressive policy to relocate everyone and bulldoze all of the houses. (State Parks had already evicted residents who lived directly on Topanga Beach in the late &#x27;70s).

A group of 10 Lower Topanga poets calling themselves the &quot;Idlers of the Bamboo Grove&quot; published a book of the same name in 2002, celebrating their community and lamenting the prospect of having to leave. Their publisher, Brass Tacks Press, continued publishing works about Lower Topanga, as well as maintaining an online &quot;Lower Topanga Photo Archive&quot;.

Even though Lower Topanga residents were given money to leave, some fought bitterly against their relocation in court. However, the last holdouts were forced off the land in March 2006. Currently there are active efforts by TreePeople and Mountains Restoration Trust to restore the area to its pristine condition as it was prior to development.

==Culture==
Topanga is known as a bohemian enclave attracting artists, musicians, filmmakers, and others. Numerous music festivals have been organized in the canyon, including the Topanga Days Festival and Topanga Earth Day. The Topanga Film Institute hosts the annual Topanga Film Festival.

In the 1950s, blacklisted actor Will Geer had to sell his large Santa Monica home and move his family to a small plot in the canyon where they could grow their own produce. Geer&#x27;s friend Woody Guthrie had a small shack on the property. They unintentionally founded what became an artists&#x27; colony. Since its founding in 1973, the Geer family has continued to operate the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum. It has grown into an Equity theater, and occupies a natural outdoor amphitheater. It features Shakespearean plays, modern classics, and original productions, as well as musical concerts. Performers have included Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Della Reese, and Burl Ives. Odetta was part of the early music scene in the 1960s.

A famous venue in the canyon was the Elysium Institute, also known as Elysium Fields, a nudist club started by Ed Lange in 1967. After surviving extended battles with county officials the property was sold in 2002 by its founder&#x27;s heirs.

Every Memorial Day weekend on the grounds of the Topanga Community House, Topanga has an annual fair and parade, called Topanga Days. Topanga Days Country Fair features music, belly dancing, over 80 unique craft vendors and a variety of food from Cajun to Mexican to vegan. A parade is held on Memorial Day. 

Topanga Canyon also hosts an annual reggae festival titled Reggae on the Mountain that has grown to be one of the largest events in the area. The event serves as a fundraiser for the Topanga Community Club in a similar fashion as Topanga Days.

The Topanga Film Institute presents the annual Topanga Film Festival each July. The festival endeavors to bridge cultures, create and expand community, provide cultural exchange and networking opportunities.

Two outdoor shopping centers featuring local businesses form the hub of local commerce. There are no hotels, motels or gas stations in Topanga, nor are there any chain or big box stores.

The location of Topanga in the Santa Monica Mountains also makes the natural surroundings an important part of the culture. Streams, waterfalls, cliffs of exposed bedrock, landmark rock outcroppings, and overlooks with panoramic views of the mountains, Pacific Ocean and Los Angeles are common attractions. There are many trails for short walks, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, birdwatching, and rock climbing, all of which are important parts of the local community.

<text>Residency or postgraduate training is a stage of graduate medical education. It refers to a qualified physician (one who holds the degree of MD, DO, MBBS/MBChB), veterinarian (DVM/VMD, BVSc/BVMS), dentist (DDS or DMD), podiatrist (DPM),
pharmacist (PharmD) or Medical Laboratory Scientist (Doctor of Medical Laboratory Science) who practices medicine or surgery, veterinary medicine, dentistry, podiatry,clinical pharmacy, or Clinical Laboratory Science respectively, usually in a hospital or clinic, under the direct or indirect supervision of a senior medical clinician registered in that specialty such as an attending physician or consultant. 

The term &quot;residency&quot; is named as such due to resident physicians (resident doctors) of the 19th century residing at the dormitories of the hospital in which they received training. 

In many jurisdictions, successful completion of such training is a requirement in order to obtain an unrestricted license to practice medicine, and in particular a license to practice a chosen specialty. In the meantime, they practice &quot;on&quot; the license of their supervising physician. An individual engaged in such training may be referred to as a resident, registrar or trainee depending on the jurisdiction. Residency training may be followed by fellowship or sub-specialty training.

Whereas medical school teaches physicians a broad range of medical knowledge, basic clinical skills, and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields, medical residency gives in-depth training within a specific branch of medicine.

==Terminology==
A &quot;resident physician&quot; is more commonly referred to as a &quot;resident&quot;, &quot;senior house officer&quot; (in Commonwealth countries), or alternatively, a &quot;senior resident medical officer&quot; or &quot;house officer&quot;. Residents have graduated from an accredited medical school and hold a medical degree (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB). Residents are, collectively, the &quot;house staff&quot; of a hospital. This term comes from the fact that resident physicians traditionally spend the majority of their training &quot;in house&quot; (i.e., the hospital). The similar term &quot;residency&quot; is named as such due to resident physicians of the 19th century residing at the dormitories of the hospital in which they received training.

Duration of residencies can range from two years to seven years, depending upon the program and specialty.

In the United States, the first year of residency is commonly called an &quot;internship&quot; with those physicians being termed &quot;interns&quot;. Depending on the number of years a specialty requires, the term &quot;junior resident&quot; may refer to residents who have not completed half their residency. &quot;Senior residents&quot; are residents in their final year of residency, although this can vary. Some residency programs refer to residents in their final year as &quot;chief residents&quot; (typically in surgical branches), while others select one or various residents to add administrative duties to the normal learning in the last year of residency.
 Alternatively, a &quot;chief resident&quot; may describe a resident who has been selected to extend his or her residency by one year and organize the activities and training of the other residents (typically in internal medicine and pediatrics). 

If a physician finishes a residency and decides to further his or her education in a fellowship, they are referred to as a &quot;fellow&quot;. Physicians who have fully completed their training in a particular field are referred to as &quot;attending physicians,&quot; or &quot;consultants&quot; (in Commonwealth countries). However, the above nomenclature applies only in educational institutes in which the period of training is specified in advance. In privately owned, non-training hospitals, in certain countries, the above terminology may reflect the level of responsibility held by a physician rather than their level of education.

==History==
Residency as an opportunity for advanced training in a medical or surgical specialty evolved in the late 19th century from brief and informal programs for extra training in a special area of interest. The first formal residency programs were established by William Osler and William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Residencies elsewhere then became formalized and institutionalized for the principal specialties in the early 20th century. But even mid-century, residency was not seen as necessary for general practice and only a minority of primary care physicians participated.

The expansion of medical residencies in the United States experienced a significant surge following World War II. In the post-war landscape, the demand for skilled physicians escalated, necessitating a robust training infrastructure. The G.I. Bill, a landmark piece of legislation, played a pivotal role in fueling this expansion by providing educational benefits to returning veterans, including those pursuing medical careers. The increased financial support facilitated a surge in medical school enrollments, spurring the need for expanded residency programs to accommodate the growing pool of aspiring physicians. This period witnessed the establishment of numerous new residency positions across various specialties. In
1940 there were approximately 6,000 residency positions available, but by 1970 the available spots had increased to more than 40,000. At the same time, the daily operation of the hospital increasingly relied on medical residents.

By the end of the 20th century in North America, few new doctors went directly from medical school into independent, unsupervised medical practice, and more state and provincial governments began requiring one or more years of postgraduate training for medical licensure.

Residencies are traditionally hospital-based, and in the middle of the 20th century, residents would often live (or &quot;reside&quot;) in hospital-supplied housing. &quot;Call&quot; (night duty in the hospital) was sometimes as frequent as every second or third night for up to three years. Pay was minimal beyond room, board, and laundry services. It was assumed that most young men and women training as physicians had few obligations outside of medical training at that stage of their careers.

The first year of practical patient-care-oriented training after medical school has long been termed &quot;internship&quot;. Even as late as the middle of the twentieth century, most physicians went into primary care practice after a year of internship. Residencies were separate from internship, often served at different hospitals, and only a minority of physicians did residencies.

In the United States, the Libby Zion case, which led to the Libby Zion Law, garnered attention in 1984, shed light on the demanding work hours imposed on medical residents. Responding to this concern, the Association of American Medical Colleges released a position statement in 1988, recommending a cap of 80 work hours per week for residents. Subsequently, in 1989, New York became the first state to address this issue by implementing regulations through the Health Code, marking a pivotal moment in the regulation of resident hours. These regulations, integrated into the state hospital code, included duty hour limits and supervision enhancements advocated by the Bell Commission. However, despite the issuance of regulations, compliance was slow to materialize, and a decade later, site visits revealed widespread noncompliance with the established limits. The efforts to address and regulate resident work hours culminated nationally in 2003 when the ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) mandated these limits across the United States.
==Residency around the world==

===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan, the residency (Dari, &quot;تخصص&quot;) consists of a three to seven years of practical and research activities in the field selected by the candidate. The graduate medical students do not need to complete the residency because they study medicine in six years (three years for clinical subjects, three years clinical subjects in hospital) and one-year internship and they graduate as general practitioner. Most students do not complete residency because it is too competitive.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, the residency (Spanish, &quot;residencia&quot;) consists of a three to four years of practical and research activities in the field selected by both the candidate and already graduated medical practitioners. Specialized fields such as neurosurgery or cardio-thoracic surgery require longer training. Through these years, consisting of internships, social services, and occasional research, the resident is classified according to their residency year as an R1, R2, R3 or R4. After the last year, the &quot;R3 or R4 Resident&quot; obtains the specialty (&quot;especialidad&quot;) in the selected field of medicine.

===Australia===

In Australia, specialist training is undertaken as a registrar; The term &#x27;resident&#x27; is used synonymously with &#x27;hospital medical officer&#x27; (HMO), and refers to unspecialised postgraduate medical practitioners prior to specialty training.

Entry into a specialist training program occurs after completing one year as an intern (post-graduate year 1 or &quot;PGY1&quot;), then, for many training programs, an additional year as a resident (PGY2 onward).
Training lengths can range from 3 years for general practice to 7 years for paediatric surgery.

===Canada===
In Canada, Canadian medical graduates (CMGs), which includes final-year medical students and unmatched previous-year medical graduates, apply for residency positions via the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). The first year of residency training is known as &quot;Postgraduate Year 1&quot; (PGY1).

CMGs can apply to many post-graduate medical training programs including family medicine, emergency medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, neurology, and psychiatry, amongst others.

Some residency programs are direct-entry (family medicine, dermatology, neurology, general surgery, etc.), meaning that CMGs applying to these specialties do so directly from medical school. Other residencies have sub-specialty matches (internal medicine and pediatrics) where residents complete their first 2–3 years before completing a secondary match (Medicine subspecialty match (MSM) or Pediatric subspecialty match (PSM)). After this secondary match has been completed, residents are referred to as fellows. Some areas of subspecialty matches include cardiology, nephrology, gastroenterology, immunology, respirology, infectious diseases, rheumatology, endocrinology and more. Direct-entry specialties also have fellowships, but they are completed at the end of residency (typically 5 years).

===Colombia===
In Colombia, fully licensed physicians are eligible to compete for seats in residency programs. To be fully licensed, one must first finish a medical training program that usually lasts five to six years (varies between universities), followed by one year of medical and surgical internship. During this internship a national medical qualification exam is required, and, in many cases, an additional year of unsupervised medical practice as a social service physician. Applications are made individually program by program, and are followed by a postgraduate medical qualification exam. The scores during medical studies, university of medical training, curriculum vitae, and, in individual cases, recommendations are also evaluated. The acceptance rate into residencies is very low (~1–5% of applicants in public university programs), physician-resident positions do not have salaries, and the tuition fees reach or surpass US$10,000 per year in private universities and $2,000 in public universities. For the reasons mentioned above, many physicians travel abroad (mainly to Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States) to seek postgraduate medical training. The duration of the programs varies between three and six years. In public universities, and some private universities, it is also required to write and defend a medical thesis before receiving a specialist degree

===France===

In France, students attending clinical practice are known as &quot;externes&quot; and newly qualified practitioners training in hospitals are known as &quot;internes&quot;. The residency, called &quot;Internat&quot;, lasts from three to six years (depending on the speciality) and follows a competitive national ranking examination. It is customary to delay submission of a thesis. As in most other European countries, many years of practice at a junior level may follow.

French residents are often called &quot;doctor&quot; during their residency. Literally speaking, they are still students and become M.D. only at the end of their residency and after submitting and defending a thesis before a jury.

===Greece===
In Greece, licensed physicians are eligible to apply for a position in a residency program. To be a licensed physician, one must finish a medical training program which in Greece lasts for six years. A one-year obligatory rural medical service (internship) is necessary to complete the residency training. Applications are made individually in the prefecture where the hospital is located, and the applicants are positioned on first-come, first-served basis. The duration of the residency programs varies between three and seven years.

===India===

In India, after completing MBBS degree and one year of integrated internship, doctors can enroll in several types of postgraduate training programs:

M.D. (DOCTOR OF MEDICINE) in: Anesthesiology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Community Medicine, Dermatology Venereology and Leprosy, General Medicine, Forensic Medicine, Microbiology, Pathology, Paediatrics, Pharmacology, Physical medicine and rehabilitation, Physiology, Psychiatry, Radio diagnosis, Radiotherapy, Tropical Medicine, and, Tuberculosis &amp; Respiratory Medicine.

M.S. (MASTER OF SURGERY) in: Otorhinolaryngology, General Surgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.

D.M. (DOCTOR OF MEDICINE) in: Cardiology, Endocrinology, Medical Gastroenterology, Nephrology, and Neurology.

M.Ch. (MASTER OF CHIRURGIE) in: Cardio vascular &amp; Thoracic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Paediatric Surgery, Plastic Surgery.

Or diploma in: Anesthesiology (D.A.), Clinical Pathology (D.C.P.), Dermatology Venereology and Leprosy (DDVL), Forensic Medicine (D.F.M.), Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology (D.G.O.), Ophthalmology (D.O.), Orthopedics (D.Ortho.), Otorhinolaryngology (D.L.O.), Paediatrics (D.C.H.) Psychiatry (D.P.M.), Public health (D.P.H.), Radio-diagnosis (D.M.R.D.), Radiotherapy (D.M.R.T.)., Tropical Medicine &amp; Health (D.T.M. &amp; H.), Tuberculosis &amp; Chest Diseases (D.T.C.D.), Industrial Health (D.I.H.), Maternity &amp; Child Welfare (D. M. C. W.)

===Italy===
In Italy, after completing a cycle of 6 years of studies, students get the title of &quot;Medico &quot;generico&quot;&quot; (generic physician), and are authorized to limited activities, like: teach first aid practices, act as temporary substitute of a primary care physician or issue medical certificates for sports purposes. 

Later the physicians can complete the studies with a specialization training. 
Such specialization is required even to practice as family doctor or primary care physician.

Resident is translated as: &quot;specializzanda&quot; or &quot;specializzando&quot; according to gender.

===Mexico===

In Mexico, physicians need to take the ENARM (National Test for Aspirants to Medical Residency) (Spanish: Examen Nacional de Aspirantes a Residencias Médicas) in order to have a chance for a medical residency in the field they wish to specialize. The physician is allowed to apply to only one speciality each year. Some 35,000 physicians apply and only 8000 are selected. The selected physicians bring their certificate of approval to the hospital that they wish to apply (Almost all the hospitals for medical residency are from government based institutions). The certificate is valid only once per year and if the resident decides to drop residency and try to enter a different speciality she will need to take the test one more time (no limit of attempts). All the hosting hospitals are affiliated to a public/private university and this institution is the responsible to give the degree of &quot;specialist&quot;. This degree is unique but equivalent to the MD used in the UK and India. In order to graduate, the trainee is required to present a thesis project and defend it.

The length of the residencies is very similar to the American system. The residents are divided per year (R1, R2, R3, etc.). After finishing, the trainee may decide if he wants to sub-specialize (equivalency to fellowship) and the usual length of sub-specialty training ranges from two to four years. In Mexico the term &quot;fellow&quot; is not used.

All the specialties in Mexico are board certified and some of them have a written and an oral component, making these boards ones of the most competitive in Latin America.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, after completing a MBBS degree and further completing a one year house job, doctors can enroll in two types of postgraduate residency programs. The first is a MS/MD program run by various medical universities throughout the country. It is a 4–5-year program depending upon the specialty. The second is a fellowship program which is called Fellow of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (FCPS) by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP). It is also a 4–5-year program depending upon the specialty.

There are also post-fellowship programs offered by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan as a second fellowship in subspecialties.

===Portugal===

In Portugal, a resident physician is one undergoing postgraduate training aimed at obtaining a medical specialty. This training period begins after completing medical school and can last between 5 and 7 years, depending on the chosen specialty. At the end of their residency, physicians attain the status of specialist.

The Medical Residency in Portugal is regulated by Decree-Law No. 60/2007, of March 13, and by Ordinance No. 183/2006, of February 22 (Medical Residency Regulation). It is organized into two training periods: the Common Year and the Professional Specialization Area. Until 2004, the residency was divided into General (2 years) and Complementary (3 to 6 years) phases.

Upon completing medical school, doctors apply to a national competition for admission into the Medical Residency. This competition determines their placement for training locations and specialties, prioritizing the score obtained in a national ranking exam (a test with one hundred questions and five multiple-choice answers). The second criterion, used only in cases of a tie, is the medical school final grade.
There is frequent confusion between a resident physician and an internal medicine specialist, also known as an internist. These terms are not synonymous, even though a resident physician may be pursuing specialization in internal medicine.

The Portuguese Medical Association is the entity that regulates medical practice in Portugal, ensuring the technical-scientific postgraduate training of its members through residency programs, which grant physicians specialist status.

===Saudi Arabia===

In Saudi Arabia, an MD must pass the Saudi Medical License Exam (SMLE) to apply for medical residency programs. The competitiveness of residency programs varies by specialty and region, with Plastic Surgery, Ophthalmology, Dermatology, and ENT being the most competitive. Residency durations range from 3 to 7 years, depending on the specialty. All residency programs include an end-of-training medical exam, which is conducted in English, as a requirement for board certification.

===South Korea===

1 year internship is obligation to enter 3-4 year residency.

===Spain===
All Spanish medical degree holders need to pass a competitive national exam (named &#x27;MIR&#x27;) in order to access the specialty training program. This exam gives them the opportunity to choose both the specialty and the hospital where they will train, among the hospitals in the Spanish Healthcare Hospital Network. Currently, medical specialties last from 4 to 5 years.

There are plans to change the training program system to one similar to the UK&#x27;s. There have been some talks between Ministry of Health, the Medical College of Physicians and the Medical Student Association but it is not clear how this change process is going to be.

===Sweden===
====Prerequisites for applying to a specialist training program====

A physician practicing in Sweden may apply to a specialist training program () after being licensed as a physician by The National Board of Health and Welfare. To obtain a license through the Swedish education system a candidate must go through several steps. First the candidate must successfully finish a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate program, made up of two years of pre-clinical studies and three and a half years of clinical postings, at one of Sweden&#x27;s seven medical schools—Uppsala University, Lund University, The Karolinska Institute, The University of Gothenburg, Linköping University, Umeå University, or Örebro University—after which a degree of Master of Science in Medicine () is awarded. The degree makes the physician eligible for an internship () ranging between 18 and 24 months, depending on the place of employment.

The internship is regulated by the National Board of Health and Welfare and regardless of place of employment it is made up of four main postings with a minimum of nine months divided between internal medicine and surgery—with no less than three months in each posting—three months in psychiatry, and six months in general practice. It is customary for many hospitals to post interns for an equal amount of time in surgery and internal medicine (e.g. six months in each of the two). An intern is expected to care for patients with a certain degree of independence but is under the supervision of more senior physicians who may or may not be on location.

During each clinical posting the intern is evaluated by senior colleagues and is, if deemed having skills corresponding to the goals set forth by The National Board of Health and Welfare, passed individually on all four postings and may go on to take a written exam on common case presentations in surgery, internal medicine, psychiatry, and general practice.

After passing all four main postings of the internship and the written exam, the physician may apply to The National Board of Health and Welfare to be licensed as a Doctor of Medicine. Upon application the physician has to pay a licensing fee of SEK 2,300—approximately equivalent to EUR 220 or USD 270, as per exchange rates on 24 April 2018—out of pocket, as it is not considered to be an expense directly related to medical school and thus is not covered by the state.

Physicians who have a foreign medical degree may apply for a license through different paths, depending on whether they are licensed in another EU or EEA country or not.

====Specialty selection====

The Swedish medical specialty system is, as of 2015, made up of three different types of specialties; base specialties, subspecialties, and add-on specialties. Every physician wishing to specialize starts by training in a base specialty and can thereafter go on to train in a subspecialty specific to their base specialty. Add-on specialties also require previous training in a base specialty or subspecialty but are less specific in that they, unlike subspecialties, can be entered into through several different previous specialties.

Furthermore, the base specialties are grouped into eight classes—pediatric specialties, imaging and functional medicine specialties, independent base specialties, internal medicine specialties, surgical specialties, laboratory specialties, neurological specialties, and psychiatric specialties.

It is a requirement that all base specialty training programs are at least five years in length. Common reasons for base specialty training taking longer than five years is paternity or maternity leave or simultaneous Ph.D. studies.

=====Base specialties and subspecialties=====

=====Add-on Specialties=====

======Allergology======
To train in the add-on specialty of allergology a physician must first be a specialist in general practice, occupational and environmental medicine, pediatric allergology, endocrinology and diabetology, geriatrics, hematology, dermatology and venerology, internal medicine, cardiology, clinical immunology and transfusion medicine, pulmonology, medical gastroenterology and hepatology, nephrology or otorhinolaryngology.

======Occupational medicine======
To train in the add-on specialty of occupational medicine a physician must first be a specialist in one of the pediatric class specialties, one of the independent class specialties (excluding clinical pharmacology, clinical genetics, forensic medicine, and social medicine), one of the internal medicine class specialties, one of the neurological class specialties (excluding clinical neurophysiology) or one of the psychiatric class specialties.

======Addiction medicine======
To train in the add-on specialty of addiction medicine a physician must first be a specialist in pediatric psychiatry or psychiatry.

======Gynecologic oncology======
To train in the add-on specialty of gynecologic oncology a physician must first be a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology or oncology.

======Nuclear medicine======
To train in the add-on specialty of nuclear medicine a physician must first be a specialist in clinical physiology, oncology or radiology.

======Palliative medicine======
To train in the add-on specialty of palliative medicine a physician must first be a specialist in one of the pediatric class specialties, one of the independent class specialties (excluding occupational and environmental medicine, clinical pharmacology, clinical genetics, forensic medicine, and social medicine), one of the internal medicine class specialties, one of the surgical class specialties, one of the neurological class specialties (excluding clinical neurophysiology) or one of the psychiatric class specialties.

======School health======
To train in the add-on specialty of school health a physician must first be a specialist in general practice, pediatrics or pediatric psychiatry.

======Pain medicine======
To train in the add-on specialty of pain medicine a physician must first be a specialist in one of the pediatric class specialties, one of the independent class specialties (excluding clinical pharmacology, clinical genetics, forensic medicine, and social medicine), one of the internal medicine class specialties, one of the surgical class specialties, one of the neurological class specialties (excluding clinical neurophysiology) or one of the psychiatric class specialties.

======Infection control======
To train in the add-on specialty of infection control a physician must first be a specialist in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology.

======Geriatric psychiatry======
To train in the add-on specialty of geriatric psychiatry a physician must first be a specialist in geriatrics or psychiatry.

====Application process====

There is no centralized selection process for internship or residency positions. The application process is more similar to that of other jobs on the market—i.e. application via cover letter and curriculum vitae. Both types of positions are however usually publicly advertised and many hospitals have nearly synchronous recruitment processes once or twice per year—the frequency of recruitment depending mainly on hospital size—for their internship positions.

=====Factors=====

Apart from the requirement that candidates are graduates from approved medical programs and, in the case of residency, licensed as medical doctors, there are no specific criteria an employer has to consider in hiring for an internship or residency position. This system for recruiting has been criticized by The Swedish Medical Association for lacking transparency as well as for delaying time to specialist certification of physicians.

There are nevertheless factors that most employers will consider, the most important being how long a doctor has been in active practice. After completing nine out of a total of eleven semesters of medical school a student may work as a physician on a temporary basis—e.g. during summer breaks from university. This rule enables medical graduates to start working as physicians upon graduating from university without yet being licensed, as a way of building experience to be able to eventually be hired into an internship. According to a 2017 survey by The Swedish Medical Association, interns in the country as a whole had worked an average of 10.3 months as physicians before starting their internships, ranging from an average of 5.1 months for interns in the Dalarna region to an average of 19.8 months for interns in the Stockholm region.

In recruitment for residency positions less emphasis is often placed on the number of months a candidate has worked after finishing their internship, but it is common for physicians to work for some time in between internship and residency, much in the same way as between medical school and internship.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, postgraduate medical training is monitored by the Medical Council of Thailand (TMC) and conducted by their respective &quot;Royal Colleges&quot;.

Thailand has a significant issue with an imbalance of medical personnel between Bangkok and the remaining 76 provinces. As a primate city, the majority of specialists wish to remain in Bangkok after training. Each year, the TMC outlines the requirements for application to a certain specialty, depending on the needs of the country for staff within that field. Specialities are therefore classified into tiers depending on national demand. The duration spent in the national internship program depends on the specialty the graduate wishes to study. Specialties classified as &#x27;lacking&#x27; may require only one year of internship, whilst more competitive specialties often require the full three-year duration of internship to meet the application criteria. Fields classified as &#x27;severely lacking&#x27; may not require internship training at all.

Application to residency may be done on contract with a government hospital or without a contract, namely &#x27;free-training&#x27;. Government hospitals may sign contracts to sponsor residency training for specialist doctors they require. In these cases, the duration for internship required in more popular fields may be reduced. For example, a residency in internal medicine requires three years of internship if applying without contract, but is reduced to two years if applying under contract. However at the end of training, specialists under contract must return to work at that particular hospital for a minimum of the duration of residency.

Most residency programs in Thailand consist of three to four years of training. The duration of training may be up to five or six years in certain specialties. Applications are sent to the Royal College overseeing their desired specialty and candidates may apply to no more than five institutes that conduct training in that specialty. As of 2022, there were 40 base specialties and 49 subspecialties. Subspecialty training (fellowship) requires initial training in the respective base specialty and is generally 1–2 years in duration.

====Base specialties====
===United Kingdom===
===History===
In the United Kingdom, house officer posts used to be optional for those going into general practice, but almost essential for progress in hospital medicine. The Medical Act 1956 made satisfactory completion of one year as house officer necessary to progress from provisional to full registration as a medical practitioner. The term &quot;intern&quot; was not used by the medical profession, but the general public were introduced to it by the US television series &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. They were usually called &quot;housemen&quot;, but the term &quot;resident&quot; was also used unofficially. In some hospitals the &quot;resident medical officer&quot; (RMO) (or &quot;resident surgical officer&quot; etc.) was the most senior of the live-in medical staff of that specialty.

The pre-registration house officer posts lasted six months, and it was necessary to complete one surgical and one medical post. Obstetrics could be substituted for either. In principle, general practice in a &quot;Health Centre&quot; was also allowed, but this was almost unheard of. The posts did not have to be in general medicine: some teaching hospitals had very specialised posts at this level, so it was possible for a new graduate to do neurology plus neurosurgery or orthopaedics plus rheumatology, for one year before having to go onto more broadly based work. The pre-registration posts were nominally supervised by the General Medical Council, which in practice delegated the task to the medical schools, who left it to the consultant medical staff. The educational value of these posts varied enormously.

On-call work in the early days was full time, with frequent night shifts and weekends on call. One night in two was common, and later one night in three. This meant weekends on call started at 9 am on Friday and ended at 5 pm on Monday (80 hours). Less acute specialties such as dermatology could have juniors permanently on call. The European Union&#x27;s Working Time Directive conflicted with this: at first the UK negotiated an opt-out for some years, but working hours needed reform. On call time was unpaid until 1975 (the year of the house officers&#x27; one-day strike), and for a year or two depended on certification by the consultant in charge – a number of them refused to sign. On call time was at first paid at 30% of the standard rate. Before paid on call was introduced, there would be several house officers &quot;in the house&quot; at any one time and the &quot;second on call&quot; house officer could go out, provided they kept the hospital informed of their telephone number at all times.

A &quot;pre-registration house officer&quot; would go on to work as a &quot;senior house officer&quot; for at least one year before seeking a registrar post. SHO posts could last six months to a year, and junior doctors often had to travel around the country to attend interviews and move house every six months while constructing their own training scheme for general practice or hospital specialisation. Locum posts could be much shorter. Organised schemes were a later development, and do-it-yourself training rotations became rare in the 1990s. Outpatients were not usually a junior house officer&#x27;s responsibility, but such clinics formed a large part of the workload of more senior trainees, often with little real supervision.

Registrar posts lasted one or two years, and sometimes much longer outside an academic setting. It was common to move from one registrar post to another. Fields such as psychiatry and radiology used to be entered at the registrar stage, but the other registrars would usually have passed part one of a higher qualification, such as a Royal College membership or fellowship before entering that grade. Part two (the complete qualification) was necessary before obtaining a senior registrar post, usually linked to a medical school, but many left hospital practice at this stage rather than wait years to progress to a consultant post.

Most British clinical diplomas (requiring one or two years&#x27; experience) and membership or fellowship exams were not tied to particular training grades, though the length of training and nature of experience might be specified. Participation in an approved training scheme was required by some of the royal colleges. The sub-specialty exams in surgery, now for Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, were originally limited to senior registrars. These rules prevented many of those in non-training grades from qualifying to progress.

Once a senior registrar, depending on specialty, it could take anything from one to six years to go onto a permanent consultant or senior lecturer appointment. It might be necessary to obtain an M.D. or Ch. M. degree and to have substantial published research. Transfer to general practice or a less favoured specialty could be made at any stage along this pathway: Lord Moran famously referred to general practitioners as those who had &quot;fallen off the ladder&quot;.

There were also permanent non-training posts at sub-consultant level: previously senior hospital medical officer and medical assistant (both obsolete) and now staff grade, specialty doctor and associate specialist. The regulations did not call for much experience or any higher qualifications, but in practice both were common, and these grades had high proportions of overseas graduates, ethnic minorities and women.

Research fellows and PhD candidates were often clinical assistants, but a few were senior or specialist registrars. A large number of &quot;Trust Grade&quot; posts had been created by the new NHS trusts for the sake of the routine work, and many juniors had to spend time in these posts before moving between the new training grades, although no educational or training credit was given for them. Holders of these posts might work at various levels, sharing duties with a junior or middle grade practitioner or with a consultant.

In 2005, the structure of medical training was reformed when the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) reform programme was instituted. House officers and the first year of senior house officer jobs were replaced by a compulsory two-year foundation training programme, followed by competitive entry into a formal specialty-based training programme. Registrar and Senior Registrar grades had been merged in 1995/6 as the specialist registrar (SpR) grade. Following MMC these posts were replaced by the merged Specialty Registrar (StR) role. StRs may be in post up to eight years, depending on the field.

The structure of the training programmes varies with specialty but there are five broad categories:
* Themed core specialties (A&amp;E, Intensive Therapy Unit [ITU] and anaesthetics)
* Surgical specialties
* Medical specialties
* Psychiatry
* Run-through specialties (e.g., general practice, clinical radiology, pathology, paediatrics)

The first four categories all run on a similar structure: the Trainee first completes a two-year structured and broad-based core training programme in that field (e.g., core medical training), which makes them eligible for competitive entry into an associated specialty training scheme (e.g., gastroenterology if core medical training has been completed). The Core training years are referred to as CT1 and CT2, and the specialist years are ST3 onwards until completing training. Core training and the first year or two of speciality training are equivalent to the old Senior House Officer jobs.

It is customary for trainees in these areas to sit their Membership examinations (e.g., Royal College of Physicians (MRCP), Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS)) in order to progress and compete for designated sub-specialty training programmes that attract a national training number as specialty training year 3 (ST3) and beyond – up to ST9 depending on the particular training specialty.

In the fifth category, the trainee immediately starts specialty training (ST1 instead of CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (run-through training). Most of the run-through schemes are in stand-alone specialties (e.g., radiology, public health, histopathology), but there are also a few traditionally surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing core surgical training (e.g., neurosurgery, obstetrics &amp; gynaecology, ophthalmology). The length of this training varies; for example, general practice is three years while radiology is five years.

The UK grade equivalent of a U.S. fellow in medical/surgical sub-specialties is the specialty registrar (ST3–ST9) grade of sub-specialty training. However, while US fellowship programmes are generally 2–3 years in duration after completing the residency, UK trainees spend 4–7 years. This generally includes service provision in the main specialty; this discrepancy lies in the competing demands of NHS service provision, and UK postgraduate training stipulating that even specialist registrars must be able to accommodate the general acute medical take—almost equivalent to what dedicated attending internists perform in the United States (they still remain minimally supervised for these duties).

In 2024, the British Medical Association (BMA) advocated for all junior doctors to be renamed residents to prevent the confusion between resident doctors and medical students that terms such as &quot;junior doctors&quot; and &quot;doctors in training&quot; produce.

In September 2024, following the resolution of a prolonged pay dispute, it was announced that the term &quot;junior doctor&quot; within the NHS would be replaced with &quot;resident doctor.&quot; This change was set to take effect on Wednesday, 18 September 2024.

===United States===

Medical licensure in the United States is governed by state boards of medicine. In most states, graduates of U.S. medical schools may obtain a full medical license after passage of the third step of the USMLE, and at least one year of postgraduate education (i.e., one year of residency; usually called an internship). However, in most states, international medical graduates are required longer periods of training as well as passage of the third and final step of the USMLE, to obtain a full medical license. Physicians who have full medical licenses may practice medicine without supervision (&quot;moonlight&quot;) in settings such as urgent care centers and rural hospitals while in residency. However, while performing the requirements of their residency, residents are supervised by attending physicians who must approve their decisions.

====Specialty selection====
Specialties differ in length of training, availability of residencies, and options. Specialist residency programs require participation for completion ranging from three years for family medicine to seven years for neurosurgery. This time does not include any fellowship that may be required to be completed after residency to further sub-specialize.

In regard to options, specialty residency programs can range nationally from over 700 (family medicine) and over 580 (internal medicine) to 33 programs for integrated thoracic surgery and 28 programs for osteopathic neuromusculoskeletal medicine. 

Residents choose the teaching hospital where they want to perform their residency based upon many factors, including the medical specialties offered by the hospital and reputation and credentials of the hospital. The following table shows medical specialties and the residency training times for medical specialties, as reported by the American Medical Association in 2021.

====Application process====

=====Factors=====
There are many factors that can go into what makes an applicant more or less competitive. According to a survey of residency program directors by the NRMP in 2020, the following five factors were mentioned by directors over 75% of the time as having the most impact:
Between 60% and 75% also mentioned other factors such as core clerkship grades, perceived commitment to specialty, audition elective/rotation within your department, any failed attempt in USMLE, class ranking/quartile, personal prior knowledge of the applicant, perceived interest in program and passing USMLE Step 2 CS.

These factors often come as a surprise to many students in the preclinical years, who often work very hard to get great grades, but do not realize that only 45% of directors cite basic science performance as an important measure.

Applicants begin the application process with ERAS (regardless of their matching program) at the beginning of their fourth and final year in medical school.

At this point, students choose specific residency programs to apply for that often specify both specialty and hospital system, sometimes even subtracks (e.g., Internal Medicine Residency Categorical Program at Mass General or San Francisco General Primary Care Track).

=====Interviews=====
The interview process involves separate interviews at hospitals around the country. Frequently, the individual applicant pays for travel and lodging expenses, but some programs may subsidize applicants&#x27; expenses.

=====The match=====


Access to graduate medical training programs such as residencies is a competitive process known as &quot;the Match&quot;. After the interview period is over, students submit a &quot;rank-order list&quot; to a centralized matching service that depends on the residency program they are applying for:
* most specialties – the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) by February (the AOA match used to be a separate option for DOs but was merged with the NRMP match after 2020)
* Urology Residency Match Program
* SF Match (Ophth/ Plastics)

Similarly, residency programs submit a list of their preferred applicants in rank order to this same service. The process is blinded, so neither applicant nor program will see each other&#x27;s list. Aggregate program rankings can be found here, and are tabulated in real time based on applicants&#x27; anonymously submitted rank lists.

The two parties&#x27; lists are combined by an NRMP computer, which creates stable (a proxy for optimal) matches of residents to programs using an algorithm. On the third Friday of March each year (&quot;Match Day&quot;) these results are announced in Match Day ceremonies at the nation&#x27;s 155 U.S. medical schools. By entering the Match system, applicants are contractually obligated to go to the residency program at the institution to which they were matched. The same applies to the programs; they are obligated to take the applicants who matched into them.

=====Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program=====
The Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) is a process for partially matched and fully unmatched applicant through the Match. Previous to the creation of SOAP, applicants were given the opportunity to contact the programs about the open positions in a process informally called &quot;the scramble&quot;. This frantic, loosely structured system forced soon-to-be medical school graduates to choose within minutes programs not on their original Match list. In 2012, the NRMP introduced the organized system called SOAP. As part of the transition, Match Day was also moved from the third Thursday in March to the third Friday.

The SOAP occurs during Match week. First the applicants eligible for SOAP, are informed they did not secure a Match position on the Monday of Match Week. The locations of remaining unfilled residency positions are released to the unmatched applicants the following day. Then programs contact applicants for interviews that usually occur via phone calls. After that, programs prepare lists of applicants and the positions open are offered by each program one at a time to the top applicant on their list. The applicant may accept the offer or reject it. If the offer is rejected it will go to the next applicant in the program list during the next round of SOAP. During Match year 2021 there were four rounds of SOAP.

====Work time restrictions====

In the USA, medical residencies traditionally require lengthy hours of their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be &quot;on call&quot; or share that duty with just one other physician. The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors. This was noted in a landmark study on the effects of sleep deprivation and error rate in an intensive-care unit. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and those in subsequent years can have up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24-hour shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.

Critics of long residency hours trace the problem to the fact that a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.

Criticisms of limiting the work week include disruptions in continuity of care and limiting training gained through involvement in patient care. Similar concerns have arisen in Europe, where the Working Time Directive limits doctors to 48 hours per week averaged out over a 6-month reference period.

====Financing residency programs====
The Department of Health and Human Services, primarily Medicare, funds the vast majority of residency training in the US. This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education, or DME, payments. Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education, or IME, payments, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals that is tied to admissions of Medicare patients in exchange for training resident physicians in certain selected specialties. Overall funding levels, however, have remained frozen over the last ten years, creating a bottleneck in the training of new physicians in the US, according to the AMA. On the other hand, some argue that Medicare subsidies for training residents simply provide surplus revenue for hospitals, which recoup their training costs by paying residents salaries (roughly $45,000 per year) that are far below the residents&#x27; market value. Nicholson concludes that residency bottlenecks are not caused by a Medicare funding cap, but rather by Residency Review Committees (which approve new residencies in each specialty), which seek to limit the number of specialists in their field to maintain high incomes. In any case, hospitals trained residents long before Medicare provided additional subsidies for that purpose. A large number of teaching hospitals fund resident training to increase the supply of residency slots, leading to the modest 4% total growth in slots from 1998 to 2004.

====Residency salary====

=====Resident compensation=====
Starting from the first year of postgraduate training residents trained in the USA receive compensation. According to the Medscape Residents Salary &amp; Debt Report, in 2021 the average resident annual salary was US$64,000. Overall, 43% of trainees were satisfied with their compensation.

=====Low hourly pay=====

Resident salaries are relatively low compared to those of other healthcare workers, especially when considering hourly compensation. On average, residents earn approximately $15 to $20 per hour, based on their salaries and an 80-hour work week.&lt;ref name=&quot;delivering-care/public-health/guiding-principles-protect-resident-fellow-physicians-responding&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Following a successful residency==

In Australia and New Zealand, it leads to eligibility for fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, or a number of similar bodies.

In Canada, once medical doctors successfully complete their residency program, they become eligible for certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada or the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) if the residency program was in family medicine. Many universities now offer &quot;enhanced skills&quot; certifications in collaboration with the CFPC, allowing family physicians to receive training in various areas such as emergency medicine, palliative care, maternal and child health care, and hospital medicine. Additionally, successful graduates of the family medicine residency program can apply to the &quot;Clinical Scholar Program&quot; in order to be involved in family medicine research.

In Mexico, after finishing their residency, physicians obtain the degree of &quot;Specialist&quot;, which renders them eligible for certification and fellowship, depending on the field of practice.

In South Africa, successful completion of residency leads to board certification as a specialist with the Health Professions Council and eligibility for fellowship of the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa.

In the United States, it leads to eligibility for board certification and membership/fellowship of several specialty colleges and academies.

<text>Mark S. Hanson (born December 2, 1946) is an American bishop who served as the third Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Before being elected presiding bishop, he served as bishop of the Saint Paul Area Synod as well as pastor of three Minnesota congregations: Prince of Glory Lutheran Church, Minneapolis; Edina Community Lutheran Church; and University Lutheran Church of Hope in Minneapolis. In addition to serving as Presiding Bishop, Hanson was the 11th President of the Lutheran World Federation.

== Early life and education ==
Mark S. Hanson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 2, 1946. He was raised in a Lutheran family in Minnesota. His father was a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Hanson graduated from Minnehaha Academy in 1964, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from Augsburg University in 1968. He was a Rockefeller Fellow at Union Theological Seminary from 1968 to 1969, where he received a Master of Divinity degree in 1972, and attended Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minnesota, from 1973 to 1974. He was a Merrill Fellow at Harvard University Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1979.

== Religious career ==
Following his ordination in 1974, Hanson served as pastor at Prince of Glory Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota from 1973 to 1979; Edina Community Lutheran Church, Edina, Minnesota, from 1979 to 1988; and University Lutheran Church of Hope, Minneapolis, from 1988 to 1995. He was elected Bishop of the Saint Paul Area Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) in 1995, and had been reelected to a second term prior to his election as Presiding Bishop of the ELCA in 2001.

In 2003, Hanson was elected President of the Lutheran World Federation, a role which he served concurrently with his role as ELCA Presiding Bishop. He serves on the executive council on the executive board of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. Hanson is author of &quot;Faithful Yet Changing: The Church in Challenging Times&quot; (Augsburg Fortress, Minneapolis: 2002). In 2007 Hanson was reelected on the second ballot, making him the longest-serving Presiding Bishop in the ELCA&#x27;s history.

=== Bishop of the ELCA ===

In 2005, he mourned the death of Pope John Paul II, especially for his contributions to the ecumenical movement. Since being elected presiding bishop, he has received several honorary degrees, including Doctor of Humane Letters from Augsburg University, Augustana College (Illinois), Wittenberg University, and Grand View University, Doctor of Humanities from Capital University, Doctor of Divinity from Lenoir-Rhyne College, Wartburg Theological Seminary, Susquehanna University, Wartburg College, and The Academy of Ecumenical Indian Theology and Church Administration. Mark Hanson was Presiding Bishop of the ELCA from 2001-2013, when Bishop Elizabeth Eaton was elected as the next Presiding Bishop of the ELCA at the 2013 Churchwide Assembly in Pittsburgh, PA.

== Personal life==
He is married to Ione (Agrimson) Hanson from Hettinger, North Dakota. Before the Hansons moved to Chicago, she was director of social work at Minneapolis and St. Paul Children&#x27;s Hospitals. The Hansons are the parents of six children.

== Selected works ==
He is the author of &quot;Faithful Yet Changing; the Church in Challenging Times&quot;, and &quot;Faithful and Courageous; Christians in Unsettling Times&quot;, both from Augsburg Fortress Publishers.

<doc id="1147701" wikidata="Q1134704" url="?curid=1147701" title="Volvo V70">
<text>The Volvo V70 is an executive car manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars from 1996 to 2016 across three generations.
The name &quot;V70&quot; combines the letter &quot;V&quot;, standing for &quot;versatility&quot;, and &quot;70&quot;, denoting relative platform size (i.e., a V70 is larger than a V40, but smaller than a V90).

The first generation (1996–2000) debuted in November 1996. It was based on the P80 platform and was available with front and all-wheel drive (AWD), the latter marketed as the &quot;V70 AWD&quot;. In September 1997, a crossover version called the &quot;V70 XC&quot; or &quot;V70 Cross Country&quot; was introduced. The sedan model was called &quot;Volvo S70&quot;.

The second generation (2000–2007) debuted in spring 2000. It was based on the P2 platform and, as with its predecessor, was also offered as an all-wheel drive variant marketed as the V70 AWD and as a crossover version initially called &quot;V70 XC&quot;. For the 2003 model year, the crossover was renamed to &quot;XC70&quot;. The sedan model was called &quot;Volvo S60&quot;.

The third generation (2007–2016) debuted in February 2007. It was based on the P3 platform and marketed as the &quot;V70&quot; and the &quot;XC70&quot;. Production of the V70 ended on 25 April 2016, the XC70 continued until 13 May 2016. The sedan model was called &quot;Volvo S80&quot;.

==First generation (1996–2000)==

The first generation V70 was an improved development on the basis of the Volvo 850 estate. Its overall design became more rounded doing away with the 850&#x27;s square edges. Among the many changes were a completely revised front end, fully painted bumpers and side trim and clear indicator lenses all around. Most of the interior was redesigned, with new seats, door panels and dashboard. According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.
Standard equipment was improved significantly with remote central locking, heated and electrically adjustable mirrors, two front- and two side airbags, power brakes with ABS and power windows being standard on every car. Trim levels varied for each market as did equipment levels of the most basic trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant, and to some extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engines and options could be chosen individually. In all markets more powerful versions received better or upgraded standard equipment. The &quot;T5&quot; and &quot;R&quot; were the series high-performance models.

Small cosmetic and major technical changes were introduced for the 1999 model year. The Volvo logo on the front grille was redesigned, the square &quot;XC&quot;-style roof rails replaced the rounded version and black edge stickers on the rear doors were removed. Volvo improved the SRS-system airbags by introducing dual stage deployment logic for the front airbags, and its second generation, side impact protection system side airbag (SIPS-BAG II), whose volume was increased to offer better protection. A whiplash protection system (WHIPS) was also introduced as part of the standard equipment. New engine management systems with drive-by-wire throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on all petrol turbo models. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, and an upgraded traction control now called STC (Stability Traction Control) was introduced. All-wheel drive models received thicker rear brake discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic, replacing the previous three-mode selection.

For the 2000 model year, a new 5-speed automatic transmission with adaptive shift logic was introduced. It was only available on non-turbo, front-wheel drive models and the 2000 V70 R AWD. The naturally aspirated 10V engine was replaced by a detuned 20V variant. Drive-by-wire throttle was introduced for all non-turbo petrol engines. The 2.0L V70 XC was discontinued.

===First generation models===

====V70====
The standard V70 was available with a variety of engines, gearboxes and equipment. The standard configuration was front-wheel drive. An all-wheel drive version badged as V70 AWD was available. For some markets Volvo offered a diesel version badged as V70 TDI. In countries such as Italy, with high taxes on cars with more than a 2.0L engine capacity, special petrol models with a 2000 cc engine capacity were offered. This included a 2.0T and a 2.0L T5 version, the latter with a slightly lower power output than the 2.3L variant. An optional third row seat increased occupant capacity from five to seven seats while reducing underfloor storage space in the trunk.

With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo continued to offer a factory compressed natural gas (CNG) powered car. A tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank, rear cargo space was reduced considerably. Drivers could choose whether their car ran on petrol or CNG at the touch of a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models. Neither Bi-Fuel nor TDI were offered on the North American market.

Specialised vehicles, such as taxi and police versions, were also available directly from the factory. Changes included preparations to install additional equipment, a certified calibrated speedometer, uprated brakes with wear indicators and a different level of standard equipment.

====V70 XC====
The V70 XC, also referred to as the V70 Cross Country, the V70 AWD Cross Country, or the V70 Cross Country AWD was introduced in September 1997 at the Frankfurt Auto Show for the 1998 model year as a crossover version of the V70. It featured standard all-wheel drive and was available with only two engine and gearbox choices. In the US only the 2.4L turbo engine together with an automatic gearbox was available. A 2.0L version of the V70 XC was available only for markets with high taxes on cars with an engine capacity of more than 2000 cc. Standard ride height was increased overall with more ground clearance compared to the regular AWD model. Total ground clearance is .

Visual differences from a standard V70 AWD included a unique front and rear bumper, unpainted sidetrim and sills, a squarer version of the roof rails, a unique front grille and a black decal with white Cross Country lettering across the tailgate. Buyers could also specify a two-tone exterior paint option called Duo Tone. Interior details included thicker floor mats and special canvas/leather upholstery.

====V70 R====
As the replacement for the popular 850 T-5R and 850 R, the V70 R was unveiled in May 1997. Similar to the previous generation R models it featured a unique leather/Alcantara interior with diamond stitching on the seats. Further styling touches were a special front bumper, blue gauge faces for the instrument cluster, two special colours and special alloy wheels. All US cars were equipped with 16 inch alloy wheels, other markets had 17 inch wheels available at extra cost or as standard equipment. Standard equipment was substantially upgraded over normal models with a few options available such as a trunk mounted CD-changer, Volvo&#x27;s self developed Road and Traffic Information (RTI) navigation system, or an upgraded stereo system.

Intended to be the high-performance version of the model range, all R models were fitted with the highest performance engines of the line up, and were available in both front-wheel and all-wheel drive with either an automatic or manual transmission. A redesigned suspension with lower ride height and firmer shocks as standard. Three different versions were produced, depending on the model year.

For 1998 the R was available in six colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue, Silver Metallic, Coral Red, Regency Red, Saffron. All, apart from the first one, were metallic or pearl paints with Saffron only available for the V70 R. Versions offered included FWD and an AWD, both with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. Cars with the automatic transmission were rated at , while manual transmission cars were equipped with a bigger turbo increasing power output to and torque to . The FWD manual transmission equipped R featured a viscous based limited-slip differential. In the US neither FWD nor manual transmissions were offered.

For 1999 the R was available in 8 colours: Black Stone, Classic Red, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, Cassis, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All except the first two were metallic or pearl paints with Laser Blue only being available on the R. FWD and manual transmission versions were discontinued, only AWD in combination with a 4-speed automatic were available. Cars were badged V70 R AWD. Power was increased to 250 PS. Blue engine covers were introduced for R models.

For 2000 the R was available in 6 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All, apart from the first one, were metallic or pearl paints with Laser Blue only being available on the R. A new 2.4L engine was introduced and power increased to by use of a larger turbo and variable valve timing (VVT). The newly introduced 5-speed adaptive automatic was offered but some markets such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore received the more robust 4-speed auto as used in the 98–99 MY, rear brakes were upgraded to vented discs unique to the R. A dual outlet exhaust ( a first for Volvo ) was fitted as standard with the rear bumper modified to accommodate it. Areo changes included a reshaped front spoiler with supple black lower air intakes together with recessed spotlights plus a shaped spoiler running the length of the tailgate. The interior could be ordered in a two-tone design which paired white Alcantara and black leather for the seat covers.




===Engines===

Engines for the first generation all had five cylinders. The petrol versions were part of the &quot;Volvo Modular Engine&quot; family, the diesel engines were purchased from VAG.




===Safety===
A driver airbag was standard on all V70 models, depending on the market a front passenger airbag was either always included or a no-cost option. Buyers could choose to not have a passenger airbag to be able to install a forward facing child seat. Seatbelt pretensioners, with load limiters, for both driver and front passenger were always part of the standard equipment. Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) was standard on all V70 models. Standard side airbags incorporated into the front seats supplemented the system.

Euro NCAP evaluated the S70 (saloon variant of V70) in 1998 awarding it four out of four stars for adult occupant protection. The S70 scored seven of 16 points in the front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car received two of two points available in the pole test. The S70 received a total of 25 of 37 points and therefore four stars (25–32) in Euro NCAP&#x27;s evaluation.

The S70 scored five out of five stars for front impact protection for driver and front passenger in the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety testing, and four out of five stars for driver and rear passenger side impact protection.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) granted the 850/S70 their highest rating of &quot;good&quot; for front crash protection. Rear crash protection was rated as &quot;good&quot;. The 1999 model year and later vehicles minimized or prevented whiplash with an energy absorbing seatback hinge mechanism that is standard equipment.

==Second generation (2000–2007)==

Volvo released the second generation V70 to most markets in early 2000, and for the 2001 model year in North America. Based on the Volvo P2 platform, the second generation shared major mechanical and styling commonality with the Volvo S60 saloon, offered frontal area of and a coefficient of drag of .30. The new generation featured adhesively bonded construction as opposed to spot welding in key areas, with Volvo claiming the new body to be 70 per cent more rigid than its predecessor. Critical aspects of the design for the second generation were completed before Ford acquired Volvo in 1999.

With a increase in width and height, a longer wheelbase, a slightly shorter overall length than its predecessor, and a slightly increased interior cargo volume, it went on sale in early 2000.

The interior featured raised seating in the second row, a hard point on the passenger&#x27;s side of the center console to provide support for a range of optional accessories – e.g., an optional shopping bag holder. A rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net were integrated into the rear seat backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated into the side of the front passenger&#x27;s headrest, glove compartment with pen holder and toll card, configurable center console and rear seating with a two-position backrest – one favoring cargo – the other favoring comfort.

All P2 platform Volvos received a minor facelift across all markets for 2005. The front fascia was redesigned, tail and head lamps were changed to clear covers, the center console and dashboard received detail changes. Some minor changes were made to the electrical system and some engines, such diesel engine models received a particle filter. A new 6-speed automatic transmission was introduced, available in both AWD and FWD configurations. Production of the second generation V70 and XC70 ended with the 2007 model year.

===Styling===
The second generation V70 was styled by British designer Peter Horbury, who said &quot;the design challenge involved marrying sports car style at the front with the necessary limitations of a wagon back.&quot;
More specifically, he described the concept as the &quot;front end of a Jaguar E-Type married to the back end of a Ford Transit van.&quot;

===Second generation models===

===V70===
A second generation V70 Bi-Fuel was made available. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage capacity was increased to a total of , split into one tank and two litre tanks. Unlike previous models the tanks were installed on the underside of the car, keeping all of the trunk space available.
Bi-Fuel models were only sold with the 2.4L (140PS) non-turbo engine, and a choice between a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission.

====V70 XC / XC70====
At its introduction, the second generation V70 XC received a major upgrade. It featured better ground clearance of thanks to a raised suspension, different bodywork with unpainted bumpers and fender extensions, and AWD as standard. An interior grab handle for the front passenger was installed only on this model. Early V70 XC featured special rear view mirrors, a feature that was discontinued after 2003.

Engine and gearbox choices were limited. Only the petrol 2.4L low pressure turbo, or the D5 diesel engine with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission were available. No diesel version was offered for the North American market.

For 2003, the model was renamed the XC70, in keeping with Volvo&#x27;s newly introduced XC90. Petrol 2.5L low pressure turbo engine replaced the 2.4L low pressure engine.

====V70 / XC70 Ocean Race====
In 2001, to mark their sponsorship of the just renamed Volvo Ocean Race, special Ocean Race editions of the V70 and V70 XC were announced. Released for the 2002 model year, the cars came painted only in a unique shade of blue. Silver exterior trim and roof rails, special Ocean Race floor mats as well as assorted badging, set the models apart from non-OR models.

To coincide with the 2005–2006 Volvo Ocean Race, Volvo revived the V70 and XC70 Ocean Race Editions. These were unveiled in early 2005, and once again were painted only in a unique shade of blue. They had upgraded standard equipment and special styling touches such as specific alloy wheels, blue interior trim, leather seats with contrast stitching and Ocean Race badges on the outside.

====V70 R====
As with the previous generation, Volvo offered a high-performance variant called the V70 R AWD. Based on the PCC2 concept car from 2001, the model was unveiled at the 2002 Paris Motor Show on 26 September. Released in 2003, the model pioneered many firsts for Volvo. It was only available with a Haldex based all-wheel drive system and a 2.5L turbocharged five cylinder engine rated at and of torque. This allowed for a time of 5.9 seconds. It had an electronically limited top speed of . The R was available with a M66 six-speed manual or an Aisin AW55 five-speed automatic transmission. The 2005 facelift saw the five-speed automatic replaced by a more modern six-speed unit. Large brakes made by Brembo provided high-performance braking capabilities in line with the car&#x27;s high-performance characteristics. The V70 R came as standard with Volvo&#x27;s 4C multi-mode suspension developed with suspension experts Öhlins. The driver could choose from three different settings to vary the car&#x27;s handling depending on driving style and conditions.

In a 2006 article titled &quot;The Manwagon&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; linked the V70R to a trend &quot;to lure speed-crazy guys with kids,&quot; saying &quot;car makers are trying to transform the dowdy old family hauler into something new,&quot; and that &quot;consumer research had unearthed a surprising number of family men who thought wagons could be cool, if only they had more guts.&quot;

A total of 3407 V70Rs were shipped to North America: 2004–1,565; 2005–823; 2006–674; 2007–345.
===Engines===
Engines for the second generation all had five cylinders. The petrol versions were part of the &quot;Volvo Modular Engine&quot; family. Early model years still used a five-cylinder diesel purchased from VAG which was phased out in favour of Volvo&#x27;s own five-cylinder diesel from the &quot;D5 Engine&quot; family.



Second V70 generation engine radiators featured an optional &quot;ozone-eating&quot; catalytic coating, marketed as PremAir, which converted ground-level ozone into pure oxygen during normal vehicle operation. The maximum effect was achieved in urban traffic and strong sunlight.

===Safety===
Euro NCAP evaluated the S60 (saloon variant of V70) in 2001 awarding it 4 out of 5 stars for adult occupant protection. The S60 scored 10 of 16 points in the front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car received two of two points available in the pole test. The S60 received a total of 28 of 37 points and therefore four stars (25–32) in Euro NCAP&#x27;s evaluation.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) evaluated the Volvo S60 (saloon variant). The S60 was granted the IIHS&#x27;s highest rating of &quot;good&quot; in front and rear tests. The S60 was awarded the institute&#x27;s second highest rating of &quot;acceptable&quot; in the side test. However, an improvement in the driver dummy&#x27;s pelvis/leg rating from &quot;marginal&quot; to &quot;acceptable&quot; would yield an overall &quot;good&quot; rating in the side test.

==Third generation (2008–2016)==

On 2 February 2007, Volvo debuted the third generation for the 2008 model year. Based on the Volvo P3 platform it shared numerous elements as well as general styling with the second generation Volvo S80. Compared with its predecessor, rear-seat legroom was increased by and a revised tailgate design increased the load area volume by 55 L. The V70 was offered for the first time with four- and six-cylinder engines. The high-performance V70R AWD models were discontinued with this third generation, only a mostly cosmetic R-Design package was made available.

After the 2011 model year, Volvo discontinued sales of the V70 in North America, instead marketing the FWD variant of the XC70.

The Sensus Infotainment System from the Volvo XC60 was made available in 2011 for the V70 and XC70.
For 2012 the V70 and XC70 received a minor facelift. The front received a redesigned bumper with chrome accents, the Volvo logo on the front grill was enlarged. The indicators in the side mirrors were redesigned and changed to LED, and the rear light cluster redesigned. New optional alloy wheels and exterior paint options were added.

===Third generation models===

====V70====
====V70 Plug-in Hybrid====

As part of a joint venture with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo converted two Volvo V70 to diesel-electric plug-in hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Gothenburg, Sweden, since December 2009. Vattenfall offered customers participating in this trial a supply of renewable electricity generated from wind or hydropower. This test allowed participants to experience the all-electric range at low temperatures, which has been a disadvantage of plug-in vehicles.

The V70 PHEV test car uses an 11.3 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. As reported by the test drivers, the V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstrators have an all-electric range between . The demonstrators were built with a button to allow test drivers to manually choose between electricity or diesel engine power at any time. The first phase of the field trial ended in June 2010 and included 16 families, all employees of Volvo or Vattenfall, who had the car for 1.5 weeks to one month. A second phase of the test was to run from July to December 2010 with Vattenfall employees in Göteborg and Stockholm.

Among the key findings of the first phase are:
*Most drivers chose to use electricity in city traffic at lower speeds, but switched to diesel for highway driving.
*Test drivers found that 20 to 30 km was not enough all-electric range, and called for at least , some wanted and others up to .
*All of the test drivers charge on a daily basis but none ever used the public charging station installed for the trial.
*Before the test trials, drivers were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them changed their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected.

Volvo announced in 2009, and confirmed in 2010, the launch of series production diesel-electric plug-in hybrids as early as 2012. Volvo claimed that its plug-in hybrid could achieve , based on the European test cycle.

Ultimately production of the V70 Plug-in Hybrid did not commence, and the model was never commercially available. Instead, Volvo opted to introduce the V60 PIH in 2012.

====XC70====
As with previous generation models the XC70 features increased ground clearance, optional all-wheel-drive and some cosmetic differences from the normal V70. On the outside there are XC-only front and rear bumpers, side skirts, wheel arch extensions and additional exterior door trims all in unpainted black plastic. The optional roof rails feature an embossed &quot;XC&quot; and are only available in black. Various unique alloy wheels are offered only for the XC.

For the third generation XC a new feature called hill-descent-control was introduced that limits vehicle speed when driving down a steep embankment.

====V70 / XC70 Ocean Race====
In 2011 Ocean Race Edition versions of the V70 and XC70 were unveiled to coincide with the 2011–2012 Volvo Ocean Race. All cars featured special interior trim, decor and details. Exterior colours were limited to Ocean Race Blue Metallic or Electric Silver Metallic. Engine choices were limited to the D5 or T6.

For 2014 Ocean Race models were updated with detail changes such as different door sill plates, high gloss black mirror caps and front grill to accompany the 2014–2015 Volvo Ocean Race.

===Engines===

The V70 and XC70 were available with four-, five- and six-cylinder engines.


===Comfort===
Third generation V70 and XC70 models initially had Volvo&#x27;s RTI navigation system available and have included Volvo&#x27;s Sensus Infotainment System console from model year 2012 onward. As usual with Volvo, front seats and rear bench are of orthopedic design. Dolby Pro-Logic systems are standard, and speaker upgrades and sub-woofers are also available. The standard audio system includes a CD player; optional audio has a USB connector for MP3 players, Bluetooth streaming and the ability to import music files to the car&#x27;s hard disk. From production week 46 in 2013, map upgrades can be performed by the owner via USB, rather than the previous DVD-based system.

DVD navigation with map data and remote control is standard on higher specifications. Options include a rear seat DVD entertainment system with two headrest monitors, Xenon headlights with headlamp washers, integrated child booster seats, an integrated home link remote control garage door opener, rear-door child-safety locks, front and rear park assist, power-adjustable front seats with 3-position memory and lumbar support, heated front and rear seats, an integrated grocery bag holder, an integrated sunglass holder, a frameless auto-dimming rear view mirror with rear view mirror compass, a power glass moonroof, 12 volt power outlet in the trunk, leather seats, rear tinted windows, rain sensor and an engine block heater. Anti-submarining seats and overhead-mounted seat belt reminder lights come standard. From the 2014 model year onward, a TFT dashboard replaced the analogue instruments.

Included as a standard feature beginning in 2007 was the inclusion of Volvo on call roadside assistance for four years, rear window deactivation, safe approach and home safe lighting.

===Safety===
As standard, the vehicle is equipped with driver, passenger, side and curtain airbags. Also featured is the WHIPS whiplash prevention system on the front seats.

Third generation V70s are available with the BLIS blind-spot sensor system, which can detect a vehicle otherwise hidden from a driver&#x27;s view because of its position just off to one side of the car.

As is typical for Volvos, all models feature daytime running lights to improve driver visibility. Safety options include active-bending xenon headlights, auto dipping main beam, City Safety (which includes pedestrian and cyclist recognition software), Collision Avoidance, adaptive cruise control and traffic following, driver alertness monitoring and lane departure warning. Traffic sign recognition is also available.

The latest revision of the XC70 includes DSTC (Dynamic Stability and Traction Control), which is standard on all models and combines the functions otherwise known as Electronic Stability Programme and traction control.

Euro NCAP evaluated the V70 in 2007 awarding it 5 out of 5 stars for adult occupant protection. The V70 scored 15 of 16 points in the front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car was penalised one point of two points available in the pole test for improper deployment of the curtain airbag in both the original test and the re-test. The V70 was granted an additional two points for seat belt reminders of three available in this category. The V70 received a total of 34 of 37 points and therefore five stars (33–37) in EuroNCAP&#x27;s evaluation.

<text>The Volvo S70 is a compact executive car produced by Volvo Cars from 1996 to 2000. The S70 was essentially a facelifted 850 saloon. The S70 was replaced with the Volvo S60.

==Overview==
Introduced in Europe in late 1996 for the 1997 model year and later in the U.S. for the 1998 model year, the Volvo S70 was an updated version of the Volvo 850 saloon. The S70&#x27;s body style was overall more rounded compared to its predecessor. Changes included a redesigned front end with new lights, fully colour-coded bumpers and side trim, and clear indicator lenses for the rear lights, as well as a redesigned interior. According to Volvo, a total of 1800 changes were made.

Standard equipment was improved with remote central locking, heated &amp; electrically adjustable mirrors, 4 airbags, power brakes with ABS and power windows being standard on every car. Trim levels varied for each market as did the equipment levels of the most basic trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant and to some extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engine and options could be chosen individually. On all markets more powerful versions usually received better or upgraded standard equipment. The &quot;T5&quot; and &quot;R&quot; were the series high-performance models.

For the 1999 model year, a minor facelift was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes, such as a slightly different Volvo badge on the front grille and US models now being equipped with side markers on the front fenders, most changes were done to the mechanicals. Volvo introduced its second generation side airbag which increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS, Volvo&#x27;s system to minimize whiplash injuries, was also introduced as part of the standard equipment. New engine management systems with drive-by-wire replaced the mechanical throttle on all turbo engines as well as an upgraded traction control system. Now including throttle as well as brake intervention it was renamed &quot;STC&quot;. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. All automatic transmissions were now equipped with adaptive shift-logic, replacing the previous 3-mode selection. A starter interlock was added to models with manual transmissions.

For the 2000 model year, a new 5-speed automatic transmission with adaptive shift-logic was introduced. It was only available on non turbo front-wheel drive models. The 10V engine variants were dropped and replaced by detuned 20V versions, drive-by-wire throttle was now also introduced for non turbo models.

==Models==

===S70===
With the S70, Volvo continued to offer a mid-size saloon. With a variety of models and options it was well received but was outsold by its estate variant the V70.
With engines choices ranging from 126PS to 250PS, and a diesel engine finally being available for the saloon as well as the &quot;Bi-Fuel,&quot; there was something for everyone. Market adjustments meant that outside of Europe no TDI or &quot;Bi-Fuel&quot; models were available.

Specialised versions for the fleet market, such as a taxi and police variant, were now available from the factory. Notable uses of police S70s were by some British highway patrol forces and even some North American police forces.

===S70 AWD===
From the 1998 model year to 2000 a S70 AWD was offered. It used the same setup as the V70 AWD, with the exception of the rear self-leveling suspension being an option rather than a standard feature. The only available engine was the 193 PS 2.4 L turbo with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission.

=== S70 R ===
An S70 &#x27;R&#x27; version was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year and offered the highest performance of all S70 models. The engine was rated at and for models fitted with a five-speed manual gearbox and limited slip differential. Models fitted with a four-speed automatic gearbox were rated at and . Only FWD versions were produced. The model was only available in Europe and few select other countries.

The S70 R came with a unique leather/Alcantara interior that featured diamond stitching on the seats. Further styling touches were a special front bumper, blue gauge faces for the instrument cluster, the option to have the car in a &quot;R&quot; specific colour and a choice of unique 16&quot; or 17&quot; alloy wheels. Standard equipment was substantially upgraded over normal models with few options available such as a trunk mounted CD-changer, RTI navigation system or an upgraded stereo system. Production ended with the 1998 model year.

<text>The Volvo S90 is an executive sedan manufactured and marketed by Swedish automaker Volvo Cars from 2016 to 2025. Its estate variant is called the Volvo V90.

== Models ==
For the model year of 2017 (the first model year), a short and long wheelbase sedan as well as an estate model were made available. For 2017, the short wheelbase model was sold in North America and Europe, while the long wheelbase model was primarily sold in China. Volvo has hinted at possible coupe variants, but not until at least 2020 as the Polestar 1.

=== S90 ===
Before its reveal, the first official pictures of the S90 were shown on Wednesday, 2 December 2015. The S90 was unveiled to the public in January 2016, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. The S90&#x27;s design was well received, winning the &quot;Production Car Design of the Year&quot; award for 2015.

While not a direct successor to the second-generation S80, the S90 replaces it as the flagship sedan in Volvo&#x27;s lineup. Several trim levels are available, ranging from &quot;Momentum&quot; to &quot;Inscription&quot;. In July 2016, an optional, cosmetic R-Design package was announced. A long wheelbase version was announced for availability in the United States. A mild hybrid version was offered in 2020. In 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as an option, meaning mild hybrids are the base engine option in the US.

For the 2022 model year in the United Kingdom, the range was limited to the S90 Recharge, a mild-hybrid sedan. The S90 Recharge was limited to Plus and Ultimate trim levels with the T8 AWD mild-hybrid engine, a 2.0-litre 4-cylinder available with all-wheel-drive only.

=== S90 Long Wheelbase ===
For the 2017 model year, a long wheelbase version of the S90 was made in China, primarily for that market. It is stretched by behind the B pillar. This initial Chinese variant was not badged as &quot;S90L&quot;. 

For the 2018 model year onwards, the long wheelbase S90 replaced the standard wheelbase model in the United States.

Both wheelbases were offered in Europe and the Middle East from the 2018 model year.

For the 2023 model year, an interior facelift of the S90 was made in China market.

===Production===
By mid-2017, the Swedish Torslandaverken Plant no longer produced the S90. Production and assembly has mainly moved to the Chinese Daqing plant. It is also locally assembled (CKD) in Volvo Car Manufacturing Malaysia in Shah Alam, Malaysia and Volvo Trucks Bengaluru plant in India. Production ended in 2025.

===Facelift===
In February 2020, the official photos of refreshed S90 were leaked along with the refreshed V90. The taillights now have sequential LED indicators &amp; Inscription variants get chrome garnish on the front bumper.

=== Replacement ===
In December 2023, Volvo revealed that the pre-production models of the electric successor to the S90, codenamed &quot;V551&quot; and rumored to be named the ES90, had started testing in China. It is based on the same SPA2 platform used by the EX90, and uses the same 111kWh battery pack.

== Engines ==
The S90 is only available with 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines from the VEA family (Drive-E). The more powerful petrol engines are compound charged, as is the plug-in hybrid variant called the &quot;T8&quot;. The D5 diesel engine features Volvo&#x27;s new &quot;PowerPulse&quot; technology that is designed to eliminate turbo lag, as well as an i Art injection system.



==Safety==
The S90 was one of the IIHS&#x27;s Top Safety Picks for 2017, 2018, 2019, and earned Top Safety Pick+ in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

<text>The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), (Cherokee: ᏣᎳᎩᏱ ᏕᏣᏓᏂᎸᎩ, &quot;Tsalagiyi Detsadanilvgi&quot;) is a federally recognized Indian tribe based in western North Carolina in the United States. They are descended from the small group of 800–1,000 Cherokees who remained in the Eastern United States after the U.S. military, under the Indian Removal Act, moved the other 15,000 Cherokees to west of the Mississippi River in the late 1830s, to Indian Territory. Those Cherokees remaining in the east were to give up tribal Cherokee citizenship and to assimilate. They became U.S. citizens but in the 20th century also recovered tribal rights.

The history of the Eastern Band closely follows that of the Qualla Boundary, a land trust made up of an area of their original territory. When they reorganized as a tribe, they had to buy back the land from the U.S. government. The EBCI also own, hold, or maintain additional lands in the vicinity, and as far away as from the Qualla Boundary. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are primarily the descendants of those persons listed on the 1925 Baker Rolls of Cherokee Indians. They gained federal recognition as a tribe in the 20th century. The Qualla Boundary is not technically a reservation because the tribe bought the land outright.

The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the others being the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, both based in Oklahoma. The EBCI headquarters is in the namesake community of Cherokee, North Carolina, in the Qualla Boundary, south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

==History==
The Eastern Band members are descended primarily from about 800 Cherokees living along the remote Oconaluftee River who were not forcibly subjected to the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Principal Chief Yonaguska, with the help of his adopted European American son William Holland Thomas, managed to avoid removal. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians have maintained many traditional tribal practices. Many prominent Cherokee historians are affiliated with, or are members of, the Eastern Band.

Tsali (pronounced ), another Cherokee leader, opposed the removal. He remained in the traditional Cherokee lands with a small group who resisted the U.S. Army and tried to thwart the removal. Tsali was eventually captured. He was executed by the U.S. in exchange for the lives of the small band he protected. They were allowed to remain in the Cherokee homeland, with the condition that they give up Cherokee tribal citizenship and assimilate as U.S. citizens.

Their descendants reorganized in the 20th century and gained federal recognition as a tribe known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (named in reference to the majority of the tribe, who moved west to Indian Territory in 1838–1839). They bought back land in what is known as the Qualla Boundary, part of their traditional territory that had been ceded to the US government by the 1835 Treaty of New Echota prior to removal.

The Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina, exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts and items of historical and cultural interest. These range from the Woodland and early South Appalachian Mississippian culture periods, of which there are remains such as numerous earthwork platform mounds in the area, to 16th- and 17th-century Cherokee culture. The Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, located near the museum, sells traditional crafts made by its members. Founded in 1946, the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual is the country&#x27;s oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative.

==Contemporary language and religion==

More than two dozen Christian churches of various denominations are located within the Qualla Boundary. Many of the traditional religious practices of the Eastern Band have, over time, blended with new age views and customs according to Cherokee traditionalists. They have diverged as the result of cultural isolation of the various factions of Cherokee society. Many traditional dances and ceremonies are still practiced by the Eastern Band.

The Eastern Band began a language immersion program requiring all graduating high school seniors to speak the tribal language beginning 2007. Of the total population in the Qualla Boundary, there are approximately 900 speakers, 72% of whom are over age 50.

==Qualla Boundary==

The Eastern Cherokee Indian Nation Land, officially known as the Qualla Boundary, is located at in western North Carolina, just south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The main part of the reserve lies in eastern Swain County and northern Jackson County, but smaller non-contiguous sections are located to the southwest in Cherokee and Graham counties (Cheoah and Snowbird communities, respectively). A small part of the main reserve extends eastward into Haywood County. The total land area of these parts is , with a 2000 census resident population of 8,092 persons.

The Qualla Boundary is not a reservation but rather a land trust supervised by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land is a fragment of the extensive original homeland of the Cherokee Nation, which once stretched from western Virginia, North and South Carolina, and west to present-day southeastern Tennessee and northeastern Alabama. In the 19th century, the people had to purchase their land to regain it after it was taken over by the U.S. government through treaty cessions, which had all been negotiated by a small percentage of assimilated Cherokees.

Today the tribe earns most of its revenue from a combination of federal and state funds, tourism, and the Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee casino, established in the early 1990s. The gaming revenue is directed at economic development, as well as tribal welfare and support of cultural initiatives, such as the language immersion program and development of historic preservation programs.

===Recreational tourism===
Tourism in the area also offers many campgrounds, trails and river adventures, mountain biking, fishing, golfing, spas, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Unto These Hills Outdoor Historical Drama, Oconaluftee Indian Village, Cherokee Botanical Garden and Nature Trail, the Museum of the Cherokee People, zoos, restaurants, and a collection of galleries and shops representing fine traditional artists, such as Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual.

===Gaming relations with North Carolina===
In 1988, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which allowed federally recognized tribes to establish casinos on tribal property. Under the act, tribes are limited to offer casino games that correspond to the existing level of gaming allowed under state law. North Carolina was unique in permitting the Cherokees to establish a casino offering Class III gaming in 1994, well before the state allowed a lottery. The typical pattern has been for states to offer a lottery, followed by an agreement between the state and the Indian tribe to allow establishment of a casino or other form of gaming operation.

The first major casino in North Carolina, Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee (in partnership with Caesars Entertainment), was opened on Qualla Boundary on November 13, 1997. The casino was the result of nearly ten years of negotiations among tribal, state, and federal officials. Principal Chief Jonathan Taylor, North Carolina Lead Liaison and Chief Negotiator David T. McCoy, and Governor Jim Hunt had developed a plan for a casino that would meet state laws and satisfy local and tribal concerns. It opened during the tenure of Principal Chief Joyce Dugan.

Tribal leaders wanted to be able to offer more than bingo and other Class I forms of gambling, to attract larger crowds and generate greater revenue. The tribe had previously opened a small casino offering forms of video poker and electronic bingo. This had been challenged by the Asheville, North Carolina, U.S. Attorney on the grounds that the tribe was offering a form of gambling that was not legal elsewhere in North Carolina. The tribe wanted to ensure agreements with the state to prevent such problems.

Since North Carolina established a state lottery in 2005, Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee casino has been permitted to extend its offered games to include Class II and III gambling. As thousands of people visit Harrah&#x27;s each year and the casino&#x27;s popularity continues to increase, the economic benefits of the casino are being realized. Annually, at least $5 million of casino profits is given to the Cherokee Preservation Fund; this institution pays for projects that promote non-gambling economic development, protect the environment, and preserve Cherokee heritage and culture. Another portion of casino profits goes to improving tribal healthcare, education, housing, etc. Part of the revenue goes to the state of North Carolina, as provided by the agreement drafted by Taylor and Hunt.

In 1996, the first amendment to the compact was entered into the Federal Register, establishing the appointments of the Gaming Commission, staggered five-year terms for commissioners, and the ability to hire independent legal counsel upon tribal approval. In 2001, the second amendment to the compact was entered: it raised the gambling age from 18 to 21, affected the qualifications and appointments to the Gambling Commission between the tribe and the North Carolina governor, created the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, and clarified games, prizes and gifts awarded. In 2002, an agreement of authorization was reached that allowed the tribe to hold electronic bingo and raffle games.

In 2011, Governor Bev Perdue and Principal Chief Michell Hicks came to an agreement on a new 30-year gaming compact. The agreement allowed live table games and grants the tribe sole rights to provide those games west of Interstate 26. Based on this grant of exclusivity, the tribe had agreed to a revenue-sharing agreement with the state, with funds to be used by the state only for public education purposes. In September 2015 the tribe opened their second casino, Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Valley River, in Murphy, North Carolina. In July 2019 Governor Roy Cooper signed Senate Bill 154 that permitted wagering on sports and horse racing on tribal lands, after the state legalized sports betting in other venues.

==Outside the Qualla Boundary==

===Acquisition of sacred mounds and towns===
Since the late 20th century, the tribe has acquired such sacred sites as Nikwasi Mound (2019, in Franklin, North Carolina) and, downriver, Cowee (2007) (with 70 acres) and Kituwah (1996) mounds, each along the Little Tennessee River. Each is estimated to have been built more than 1,000 years ago. The EBCI also acquired the Tallulah (1996) mound in Robbinsville, North Carolina. In 2020, Mainspring Conservation Trust acquired 40 acres that include the Watauga Mound and part of the ancient Watauga Town site, to conserve on behalf of the EBCI. The property is located between Nikwasi upstream and Cowee downstream.

The EBCI is working with local non-profits, such as Mainspring Conservation Trust, Western Carolina University, and local governments to develop the &quot;Nikwasi Trail&quot;, highlighting a route along the Little Tennessee River. This is formally known as the Nikwasi-Cherokee Cultural and Heritage Corridor, beginning in Macon County, North Carolina, where the river enters from Georgia. In 2018 partner groups installed a viewing overlook with interpretive panels across the river from the Cowee mound site. This is the second sacred site on this corridor going north from Franklin. More highlighting and interpretation of such sites is planned, in connection with related activities along this route.

Since 2011 the EBCI have been collaborating with regional universities, the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, and the Duke Energy Foundation on what is called the &quot;Western North Carolina Mounds and Towns Project.&quot; As part of this, Western Carolina University, the Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research Program at the University of Georgia, and the Tribal Historic Preservation Office of the EBCI have conducted outreach with tribal members, in what is described as indigenous archeology. The data gathered integrates tribal knowledge, as well as information from GIS and non-invasive technologies, excavations, archeology, and anthropology. This has enabled the tribe to have a better record of mounds, with location data and chronological data for its use. Because such mounds were subject to looting in the past, the tribe is keeping the locations of most mounds secret in order to preserve them.

===Kituwah LLC===
The Kituwah Limited Liability Company (LLC) was established in 2019 to launch or acquire businesses to help diversify the tribes revenues outside of gaming. Kituwah is focused on property development, entertainment and hospitality, and professional services. That same year, Kituwah purchased in the Sevierville, Tennessee neighborhood of Kodak, for $13.5 million; its first tenant was a Buc-ee&#x27;s store, with a future Courtyard by Marriott and a sports betting bar. In 2022, discussions began with historical theme park company Puy du Fou on a possible partnership at the Sevierville site. Kituwah also retains management and operations of Cherokee Cinemas and in 2020 acquired Wylliesburg, Virginia-based Cardinal Homes Inc., a modular home builder, for $5.8 million.

===EBCI Holdings, LLC===
Established in 2020, EBCI Holdings is an LLC formed to diversify the tribe&#x27;s holdings in the commercial gaming and hospitality business. Both Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Casino Resort and Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Valley River were consolidated under EBCI Holdings and in 2021 purchased its first casino outside North Carolina, Caesars Southern Indiana for $250 million.

In December 2021, EBCI Holdings announced the creation of a &quot;gaming technology incubator&quot; fund, where they would invest in gambling startups. In August 2022, EBCI Holdings announced a joint venture with Caesars Entertainment on a $650 million project to develop Caesars Virginia, in Danville, Virginia, slated to open in late 2024. In November 2022, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission approved a move to allow EBCI Holdings a 48% minority stake, $25 million, in a quarter horse race track in Cannonsburg, Kentucky. On October 27, 2023, Sandy&#x27;s Racing &amp; Gaming officially opened, with the horse race track to open in 2025.

==Enrollment and government==
In order to be enrolled in the EBCI, one must have at least one direct, lineal ancestor that appears on the 1924 Baker Roll of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and must possess at least 1/16 degree of Eastern Cherokee blood to meet the tribe&#x27;s blood quantum requirement. This is different from the Cherokee Nation (headquartered in Oklahoma), which has no blood quantum requirements, instead requiring only lineal descent from one or more ancestors recorded on the Dawes Rolls (which recorded assumed or estimated blood quantum and race), an older roll than the 1924 Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma also requires a minimum blood quantum for enrollment and utilizes a different base roll.

The EBCI and other federally recognized Cherokee tribes have opposed recognition for other tribes, such as the Lumbee. Mark Edwin Miller states in his work that even &quot;so-called purely &#x27;descendancy&#x27; tribes such as the Five Tribes with no blood quantum requirement jealously guard some proven, documentary link by blood to distant ancestors. More than any single BIA requirement, however, this criterion has proven troublesome for southeastern groups [seeking federal recognition] because of its reliance on non-Indian records and the confused (and confusing) nature of surviving documents.&quot;

The government of the EBCI is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. These consist of the principal chief and vice-chief, the unicameral Tribal Council, and the Cherokee courts. The EBCI Code of Ordinances delineates the structure and function of the tribal government. Elections are held on odd-numbered years, with the primary elections on the first Thursday in June and general elections on the first Thursday in September. To be an eligible voter to participate in the elections, the person must be: 1) an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; 2) at least 18 years of age on the date of the applicable election; 3) registered with the tribe&#x27;s Board of Elections.

===Executive branch===
The EBCI executive branch is governed by Chapter 117, Article I of the EBCI Code of Ordinances. Both the principal chief and the vice-chief are elected to a four-year by an at-large election. The duties of both elected officials are to represent and defend the rights, interests, lands and funds of the Tribe before any legislative committee or body of the federal or state governments. The principal chief also has veto authority on any resolution or ordinance enacted by the Tribal Council; and can appoint government division secretaries and members to the following organizations: Cherokee Police Commission, Kituwah Economic Development Board, and the Tribal Gaming Commission.

===Legislative branch===
The unicameral Tribal Council consists of 12 members, with two representatives elected from each community, except for Cherokee County and Snowbird, which share two representatives. Its authority to legislate and to conduct investigations and hearings comes from Chapter 117, Article II of the EBCI Code of Ordinances. It also has the sole power and authority to approve assignment and transfer of possessory rights to its lands among its members and has quasi-judicial powers to resolve disputes. The Tribal Council can also override a veto, with two-thirds majority, and can review some appointments by the principal chief. Members are elected to two-year terms and are assigned to boards and committees, which include planning, business, lands, community services, manpower, investment, education, and housing.

===Judiciary===
The EBCI tribal courts derive their authority from Chapter 7 of the EBCI Code of Ordinances; it consists of one supreme court (one chief justice and two associate justices), one trial court (one chief judge and two associate judges), and such other trial courts of special jurisdiction as established by law (e.g. juvenile court). All justices and judges are appointed upon nomination by the principal chief, and confirmed by the Tribal Council. The chief justice, chief judge, and associate judges for trial courts of special jurisdiction have six-year terms and are eligible for reappointment, while associate justices and associate judges of the trial court have four-year terms and are eligible for reappointment.

<doc id="1147738" wikidata="Q7975521" url="?curid=1147738" title="Waves (Katrina and the Waves album)">
<text>Waves is the fourth studio album by new wave band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1986 by Capitol Records. It followed their US and UK Top 30 album &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; (1985), reaching No. 49 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 70 on the UK Albums Chart.
&quot;Waves&quot; sold less than half of what its predecessor had, generating a modest hit with the single &quot;Sun Street&quot; (UK No. 22).

==Reception==

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald wrote that although &quot;Waves&quot; is &quot;not a disaster by any stretch,&quot; it&#x27;s certainly not up to the standards of their previous album &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot;. Part of this, according to Greenwald, is because main songwriter Kimberley Rew only contributed two songs to the album. Greenwald felt that there are some fine moments, however, such as Vince de la Cruz&#x27;s &quot;Sun Street&quot; and Katrina Leskanich&#x27;s &quot;Tears for Me.&quot; He added that Rew&#x27;s two songs, &quot;Is That It&quot; and &quot;Lovely Lindsay,&quot; are &quot;mini-masterpieces&quot;, and that they &quot;eventually push the group and this album somewhere near the goal line.&quot; In his artist biography on AllMusic, Bruce Eder wrote that &quot;Waves&quot; was a good enough album but no improvement upon the &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; album. He also felt that the band&#x27;s work lost its edge between the two albums.

<doc id="1147740" wikidata="Q7709515" url="?curid=1147740" title="Thalamus Ltd">
<text>Thalamus Ltd (also known as Thalamus) was a British computer game developer that published titles for a number of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==History==
===Genesis===
&quot;Thalamus Ltd&quot; was created in 1986 as an in-house software publishing label of British magazine publisher Newsfield Publications Ltd, to take advantage of their leading position publishing computer game magazines, such as &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, during the mid-1980s. Ex-Activision PR Manager Andrew Wright was assigned the position of Company Director and Newsfield staff writer Gary Liddon was appointed Technical Executive. The company was initially based in Canonbury, North London, in an office shared with staff of Newsfield&#x27;s newly launched lifestyle magazine &quot;LM&quot;.

===First titles===
Thalamus capitalised on the success of the Commodore 64 gaming scene by releasing their first batch of titles on this platform. Having established numerous contacts within the C64 development scene through the popularity of their &quot;Zzap!64&quot; gaming magazine, Thalamus were able to sign up Finnish programmer Stavros Fasoulas to develop their first three titles, &quot;Sanxion&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;Quedex&quot;. Sanxion was the first release to bear the Thalamus name, and it garnered a Sizzler rating from Zzap!64 - this led to accusations of favouritism from rival publication Commodore User. Rob Hubbard provided the music for the first two titles, while Matt Gray provided the music for &quot;Quedex&quot;. &quot;Thalamusik&quot;, the loading tune that accompanied the C64 version of &quot;Sanxion&quot; proved to be so popular amongst fans that &quot;Zzap!64&quot; later included a full synthesised version on one of their cover cassettes.

The C64 version of &quot;Delta&quot; popularised the concept of the &quot;Mix-E-Load&quot; loading system. Provided as standard on the cassette versions of each game (and as a bonus on the floppy disk versions), the &quot;Mix-E-Load&quot; system allowed players to remix the loading music of the game, in real time, as the main program loaded in the background. &quot;Mix-E-Load&quot; was created by Gary Liddon in conjunction with Rob Hubbard and derived from an idea by Nick Pelling, author of well known BBC Micro games &quot;Frak!&quot; and &quot;Firetrack&quot;.

===The staff changes===
During the development of &quot;Delta&quot;, Liddon and Wright both left Thalamus, with Wright returning to Activision and Liddon pursuing a career in games programming. Ex-Quicksilva &amp; Electric Dreams development manager Paul Cooper was brought on board to head up the company and moved the offices from London to Aldermaston in Berkshire.

Stavros Fasoulas returned to Finland for National Service, so for their next release Thalamus turned to upcoming C64 programmer Martin Walker. Having already programmed the well-received C64 titles &quot;Rupert and the Toymaker&#x27;s Party&quot;, &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Martin Walker delivered an innovative puzzle/shooter hybrid named &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Moon&quot;. Despite a favourable response from critics, the game didn&#x27;t sell as well as previous Thalamus titles.

In the second half of 1988, Thalamus returned from a period of relative silence with two new titles. &quot;Hawkeye&quot; marked the commercial debut of The Boys Without Brains, a Dutch collective who had already made a name for themselves within the C64 demo scene. The game was a side-scroller with colourful graphics and a soundtrack from Jeroen Tel. &quot;Armalyte&quot; was a shoot-&#x27;em-up in the spirit of &quot;R-Type&quot;, originally conceived as its own unique identity but publicised as a sequel to &quot;Delta&quot;.

As the 1980s drew to a close, Thalamus continued to release C64 games, including the surreal puzzle/shooter &quot;Snare&quot;, the horizontal scroller &quot;Retrograde&quot;, from the Rowlands brothers and &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, a platform game with an environmental theme by Paul O&#x27;Malley. A brief experimentation with the ZX Spectrum format saw conversions of &quot;Sanxion&quot; and &quot;Delta&quot; being released, but by this time the Spectrum market was in decline and Thalamus decided to halt development of a number of Spectrum projects.

===Final titles and dissolution===
Thalamus entered the 1990s with a few more C64 titles, including &quot;Creatures&quot; and &quot;Creatures II: Torture Trouble&quot; from the Rowlands brothers, which have been lauded by several computer magazines for the strength of their gameplay and graphics on the aging machine. Cartoon-style platformers &quot;Summer Camp&quot; and &quot;Winter Camp&quot; were also released. In 1991, Newsfield ran into serious financial trouble. Newsfield were forced to halt publication of their popular gaming magazines. Europress stepped in to save the magazines, but they slowly died out over the next year or two as their respective markets dwindled.

Thalamus managed to survive the liquidation of Newsfield, but funds were running low. With 8-bit gaming being superseded by 16-bit gaming, production costs were rising, forcing hundreds of independent publishers, such as Thalamus, to either close down or allow themselves to be consumed by a publishing giant. Thalamus released their final C64 game, &quot;Nobby the Aardvark&quot; in 1993. With their various Amiga projects spiraling out of budget and no further income, Thalamus had no choice but to close down their operations.

<doc id="1147751" wikidata="Q3191449" url="?curid=1147751" title="KLOS">
<text>KLOS (95.5 FM, &quot;95-5 KLOS&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, and serves the Greater Los Angeles area. The station is owned by Meruelo Media. KLOS airs a mainstream rock radio format and has broadcast rock music in some form since 1969. The studios are on West Olive Avenue in Burbank.

The transmitter is atop Mount Wilson. The station is rebroadcast on FM translator K255BZ in China Lake, California. KLOS broadcasts using HD Radio technology. The KLOS morning drive time show, &quot;Heidi &amp; Frank&quot;, is featured on the nationally syndicated television program &quot;Dish Nation&quot; and is rebroadcast around the clock on KLOS-HD2. The HD3 digital subchannel carries a simulcast of KIRN.

==History==

===Early years===
The station first signed on the air on . The original call sign was KECA-FM, simulcasting the programming of AM sister station KECA. The two stations were owned by ABC Radio. In 1954, the call letters of the AM and FM stations were changed to KABC and KABC-FM, to reflect their corporate ownership. In 1960, KABC-AM-FM adopted an all-talk format.

On January 1, 1968, due to new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules requiring FM stations to have separate programming from their AM counterparts, KABC-FM tried something new. It became the first station in Los Angeles with an all-news format. This experiment did not last long. KABC-FM dropped all-news programming on March 11, 1968, the same day that KFWB 980 AM switched to the format.

===Rock formats===
In early 1969, KABC-FM adopted a progressive rock format known as &quot;Love&quot;. Under the direction of Allen Shaw, head of ABC FM Special Projects, the automated programming aired on ABC&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations—KGO-FM in San Francisco, KQV-FM in Pittsburgh, WABC-FM in New York City, WLS-FM in Chicago, and WXYZ-FM in Detroit. The syndicated format was voice-tracked by Brother John Rydgren.

Not long after its debut, Love was dropped in favor of live, locally programmed freeform rock music at KLOS and its FM sister stations. In 1971, the station adopted the KLOS call letters. The switch was made to avoid confusion with its AM talk station. In late 1971, the freeform progressive rock sound ended, as Shaw and KLOS program director Tom Yates launched the first album-oriented rock (AOR) station in the United States. Under AOR, KLOS played only the top tracks from the best-selling rock albums and used the slogan &quot;Rock &#x27;N Stereo&quot;. The initial slate of disc jockeys on KLOS includes Jeff Gonzer, J. J. Jackson, Jim Ladd, and Damion. By 1972, KLOS had become the top-rated FM rock station in Los Angeles. The station promoted an outdoor rock concert called &quot;California Jam&quot; held on April 6, 1974, at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California.

KLOS has sponsored a blood drive in conjunction with the American Red Cross annually since 1982. Blood donation centers are set up throughout the station&#x27;s listening area for several days, usually in the summer months, when donation levels are typically low. In 2014, the blood drive collected approximately 7,900 units of whole blood, which can be separated into red blood cells and plasma. As a token of gratitude, the station has given donors rewards such as T-shirts and vouchers for concert tickets.

In the spring of 1987, KLOS general manager Bill Sommers hired longtime rock radio programmer Charlie West to be the station&#x27;s new program director. West hired Stephanie Mondello as music director for the station. By fall, West brought &quot;the Mark &amp; Brian Show&quot; (Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps) to KLOS for the morning drive. The station&#x27;s Arbitron ratings grew steadily under West&#x27;s direction; by 1988, KLOS emerged as the leader among Los Angeles album rock stations, finishing fifth overall in the market with a 4.3 share, up from a 3.6 in the previous rating period. When West left KLOS in early 1989, Mondello assumed programming duties, directing all key decisions and overall revenue and ratings strategies. The station maintained its fifth-place ranking overall in the market and reached the number-one position in its target young male demographics, defeating main rivals KLSX, KROQ-FM, and the upstart KQLZ (Pirate Radio). Mondello left KLOS in late 1990.

By 1994, KLOS was facing increased competitive pressure from KROQ-FM with the rise of its grunge-based modern rock format as well as KLSX and KCBS-FM (Arrow 93) which focused on classic rock. The station altered its format in response, dropping its existing DJs and most of the classic rock music in favor of more alternative rock content. This format and personnel change lasted about three years, after which most of the alternative music was jettisoned and classic rock returned. In 1997, KLOS hired John Duncan, previously at KYYS in Kansas City, Missouri, as program director and took the station in an adult rock direction. As part of his efforts to turn around the station, Duncan brought back Jim Ladd and hired Garth Kemp and other longtime Los Angeles radio personalities. During this period, KLOS ran a billboard campaign with lines such as, &quot;We lost our mind for a moment, but we&#x27;re okay now&quot;. Within eight months, the station moved from number 18 to fifth place among Los Angeles adults ages 25–54, reclaiming its status as the market&#x27;s top adult rock station. Duncan left KLOS in late 1998.

In 2005, classic rock rival KCBS-FM flipped to adult hits as &quot;Jack FM&quot;. The switch made KLOS the market&#x27;s only full-time classic rock station until the launch of KSWD (100.3 The Sound) in April 2008.

In October 2006, KLOS restructured its daily lineup of radio hosts, Cynthia Fox, &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Benson, and Jim Ladd saw each of their daily air shifts increase by one hour. However, this resulted in the temporary dismissal of former evening DJ Gary Moore; he returned in late 2007. Former overnight jock Mark Miller, previously from the long-defunct KQLZ, hosted &quot;The Best of Mark &amp; Brian Saturday Special&quot; shows Saturday mornings. Miller&#x27;s overnight shift was replaced with automated programming, billed as &quot;KLOS After Hours&quot;. This show follows the usual classic rock format, though occasionally KLOS plays deep cuts and live versions of songs that are not usually played during the daytime.

In 2007, the station came under the ownership of Citadel Broadcasting after it merged with The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s ABC Radio.

Occasionally, KLOS abandoned its format to air an &quot;A to Z&quot; special, where songs from the KLOS library were played alphabetically by title. Running 24 hours a day (with breaks only for &quot;Mark &amp; Brian&quot; and Jim Ladd&#x27;s show), it generally lasted about two weeks with no songs repeated. Unlike the station&#x27;s regular playlist featuring primarily classic rock hits, the A to Z also included a large number of obscure album tracks. In its final years, the A to Z special aired around the Christmas holidays. Since the dismissal of program director Rita Wilde in 2009, the A to Z countdown has not aired on KLOS. However, then-classic rock competitor KSWD, which hired Wilde, revamped the idea with a very similar, though shorter, compilation of familiar hits and deep tracks.

===Cumulus era===
On September 16, 2011, Cumulus Media purchased Citadel, acquiring KLOS and sister station KABC.

On August 17, 2012, Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps appeared on KLOS for the final time, effectively ending &quot;The Mark &amp; Brian Show&quot; after 25 years (including two years on previous station WAPI in Birmingham, Alabama). Three days later, on August 20, Cumulus announced that Heidi Hamilton and Frank Kramer, former hosts on KLSX and KABC, would host morning drive beginning September 4 as &quot;The Heidi &amp; Frank Show&quot;. On August 15, 2016, Cumulus announced that Frosty Stillwell, with whom Hamilton and Kramer have co-hosted at the same two stations, would join the duo weekday mornings effective September 6.

In February 2016, KLOS launched &quot;Horns Up&quot;, a Saturday evening program hosted by Stew Herrera that featured heavy metal music. The show has since been replaced with a regular classic rock mix.

Canadian radio personality and comedy writer Greg Beharrell joined KLOS in January 2017 as a weekend host and social media content producer. He moved to weeknights in January 2019.

On February 8 and 9, 2018, KLOS was one of 14 Cumulus-owned rock radio stations to take part in the &quot;St. Jude Rocks&quot; nationwide fundraising campaign. KLOS listeners contributed more than $725,000 to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee as part of the over $2 million total raised by participating Cumulus stations.

===Meruelo Media era===
On April 15, 2019, Cumulus announced the sale of KLOS to Meruelo Media for $43 million. This brings KLOS under common ownership with rhythmic top 40 station KPWR, classic hip-hop outlets KDAY and KDEY-FM, and regional Mexican station KXOS (which itself would be purchased by Meruelo over a month later; it is now Spanish rhythmic contemporary-formatted KLLI, &quot;Cali 93.9&quot;), as well as two Spanish-language television stations, KBEH and KWHY-TV. Meruelo began operating KLOS under a local marketing agreement beginning on April 16; the transaction closed on July 17. The sale of KLOS to Meruelo comes shortly after the sale of the former sister station WPLJ in New York City, as both stations were initially owned by ABC. Under the aegis of Allen Shaw, both stations were given the &quot;Love&quot; format followed by, in 1971, the live-and-local AOR format, together retaining the latter for 12 years (WPLJ flipped to top 40 in 1983; it became a non-commercial Christian music station as &quot;K-Love&quot; in 2019).

Further changes came to KLOS over the next year. On September 6, 2019, the station shifted its format to classic rock full-time, eliminating post-1990s modern rock tracks. On September 30, at 12:01 a.m., KLOS began broadcasting from its new studios at the Meruelo Media building in Burbank, leaving behind its previous location on Lindblade Street in Culver City (to which it and KABC relocated from their longtime La Cienega Boulevard studios in December 2016). The station also marked the return of the classic rock format to Los Angeles for the first time since KSWD flipped to the &quot;K-Love&quot; Christian music network in November 2017 as KKLQ. In late January 2020, KLOS switched back to mainstream rock and changed its slogan to &quot;Southern California&#x27;s Rock Station&quot;; the station reintroduced post-1990s rock into the playlist while still maintaining a heavy focus on classic rock tracks. In a cost-cutting move prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Meruelo dismissed several members of the KLOS staff in mid-2020, including Frosty Stilwell, Gary Moore, and Frazer Smith; &quot;Frosty, Heidi &amp; Frank&quot; reverted to its previous title &quot;Heidi &amp; Frank&quot;.

On August 3, 2020, &quot;The Greg Beharrell Show&quot; entered national syndication, with KLOS serving as the flagship station.

On October 3, 2020, the nationally syndicated &quot;John Clay Wolfe Show&quot; joined KLOS on Saturday mornings.

Former KROQ-FM morning personality Kevin Ryder, half of the iconic duo &quot;Kevin &amp; Bean&quot;, joined KLOS in the afternoons on February 18, 2021. Co-hosting &quot;Kevin &amp; Sluggo&quot;, he reunited with Doug &quot;Sluggo&quot; Roberts after having worked together previously at KROQ and KZZP in Phoenix. Kevin and Sluggo were given their walking papers on September 6, 2024.

==HD Radio==
KLOS broadcasts in HD Radio with three digital subchannels:

*KLOS-HD1 is a digital simulcast of the analog signal.
*KLOS-HD2 features a talk format called &quot;KLOS2&quot;. Meruelo Media officially launched the channel on March 4, 2021, but the station has been broadcasting under the new format since September 2020. KLOS2 is operated jointly with Toad Hop Entertainment, a company owned by KLOS morning co-host Frank Kramer who serves as program director for the new service. Programming consists of continuous &quot;Heidi &amp; Frank&quot; repeats, with plans to add original shows later.
*KLOS-HD3 airs a simulcast of KIRN. It originally aired an Armenian music format branded as &quot;SoCal Armenian&quot; until around 2021.
==Notable personalities==
Throughout its history as a rock station, KLOS has been home to many prominent progressive rock and AOR DJs.

Chris Carter hosts a locally produced version of &quot;Breakfast with the Beatles&quot; on Sunday mornings. Prior to landing at KLOS, Carter was heard on KACD-FM (Channel 103.1) in 2000 when it played adult album alternative (AAA) music. He is also the former bass player and producer for Dramarama and produced and supervised the music for the film &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;, a rock documentary about influential Los Angeles DJ Rodney Bingenheimer of KROQ-FM.

Bob Coburn (1980–1994), a former program director in Chicago and an assistant program director at KMET hosted the syndicated program &quot;Rockline&quot;. He later worked at KLSX, KCBS-FM (Arrow 93), and KZLA before returning to KLOS. Coburn died of lung cancer on December 17, 2016, at age 68.

Marc Coppola, who moved on to KGB-FM in San Diego, was on KLOS in 1977 and reappeared when it aired Westwood One&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;N Roll Never Forgets&quot;. Damion and Steve Downes both co-hosted with Marc from 1986 to 1990.

Dion hosted late nights on a part-time basis for several years. He also hosted at KLSX during its classic rock era. In 2005, Al Ramirez, another longtime late-night DJ at KLOS, died of natural causes at the age of 54.

Cynthia Fox, former KMET and KLSX personality hosted the weekday show &quot;In Tune at Noon&quot;, featuring a daily celebration of events in rock and roll history and the news. She left KLOS in July 2013 and eventually joined rival classic rock station KSWD.

Jim Ladd presented his shows in a freeform manner, interrupting the regular classic rock format during his show middays and Sunday evenings. Ladd picked the music personally, often based on listener requests, and played it in thematic sets. On Thursday mornings at midnight, Ladd devoted an hour to &quot;Headsets&quot;, which combines music with a slightly more &quot;sonic&quot; quality (designed to be heard with headphones, or with no background noise interfering), spoken-word poetry, and audio clips from movies and television. On Sundays, Ladd presented &quot;Theme of Consciousness&quot;, with all songs within a three-hour window devoted to a singular word or &quot;theme&quot; and chosen entirely by the listening audience. In addition to his work with KLOS, Ladd also appeared on KNAC during its progressive era, KMET, and KLSX. Often dubbed &quot;The Last DJ&quot;, after the Tom Petty song that was written about him, Ladd was allowed unusual latitude in selecting the music for his program. His show was routinely the number-one music-based show in its time slot. Ladd left KLOS in October 2011 and joined SiriusXM the following January, hosting daily on the Deep Tracks channel.

Jerry Longden, who worked as a DJ from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. from 1972 to 1977, worked with Jim Ladd at KNAC 105.5 FM, Long Beach, California from 1969 to 1972. Longden won Billboard Magazine&#x27;s 1971 Air Personality Award for Progressive Rock and the KLOS Station of The Year award in 1974. Longden and Ladd produced the successful 1974–1975 public service radio public service announcement program voiced by many prominent Rock recording artists of the day regarding hard drug abuse awareness, &quot;Get Off&quot; and &quot;Get Off II&quot;, including thirty TV PSAs, (now in the Library of Congress) and were founders of The National Association of Progressive Radio Announcers. Longden was also the announcer for ABC&#x27;s &quot;In Concert&quot; rock simulcast shows 1974-5 as well as the announcer for &quot;Rock Concert&quot; from 1973 to 1980. Longden worked evenings at KWST-FM, mid-days at KROQ-FM, and afternoons at KGIL-FM.

Joe Reiling (1977–1981, 2003–2009) started the &quot;Local Music Show&quot; (later renamed &quot;Local Licks&quot;). Most of Reiling&#x27;s time away from the station found him hosting his own alternative rock show worldwide on AFN (American Forces Network, formerly AFRTS, Armed Forces Radio and Television Services). He was also involved in managing, producing, and programming the in-flight audio entertainment for many domestic and international airlines as well as Air Force One. Joe died on October 7, 2017.

Frank Sontag hosted a public affairs call-in talk show that aired Sunday nights and early Monday mornings. He was part of the &quot;Mark &amp; Brian&quot; morning team and ran the control board, also contributing to the show at times. Sontag left the station in 2009; in 2013, he became the host of a Christian talk and discussion program, &quot;The Frank Sontag Show&quot;, on KKLA-FM.

Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps were the titular co-hosts of &quot;Mark &amp; Brian&quot;, a morning drive sketch comedy show that aired from September 8, 1987, until August 17, 2012. Highlights from the show aired on weekdays for one hour before each regular weekday program. A recap edition, featuring the best of &quot;Mark &amp; Brian&quot; each week, aired Saturday mornings.

Shana Livigni (1952–2015) was one of the first women to break into major market rock radio in the mid-’70s. She started at KLOS in 1980. She took over the morning drive on KLOS, the first woman to do that.

Other former KLOS personalities include Geno Michellini, &quot;Uncle&quot; Joe Benson, Steve Downes, and full-time fill-in Lynda Clayton. Denise Westwood (2000–2016), formerly at KMET, was heard on KLOS handling weekends and fill-in shifts. During her last few years at KLOS, Westwood also hosted the Sunday morning public affairs show &quot;Spotlight on the Community&quot;. Former program director Rita Wilde, who later went on to KSWD, had been choosing the music on KLOS for decades; afternoon DJ Joe Benson also left for KSWD.

==Awards and nominations==
Since 1991, KLOS has won two Marconi Radio Awards, as well as three Crystal Radio Awards for its community service efforts.

<text>The titular nation is the single dominant ethnic group in a particular state, typically after which the state was named. The term was first used by Maurice Barrès in the late 19th century.

==Soviet Union==
The notion was used in the Soviet Union to denote nations that give rise to titles of autonomous entities within the union: Soviet republics, autonomous republics, autonomous regions, etc., such as Byelorussian SSR for Belarusians.

For an &quot;ethnos&quot; to become a Soviet titular nation, it had to satisfy certain criteria in terms of the amount of population and compactness of its settlement. The language of a titular nation was declared an additional (after Russian) official language of the corresponding administrative unit.

==China==
The People&#x27;s Republic of China government has adopted some of the principles behind this Soviet concept in its &quot;ethnic minority&quot; policy—see Autonomous administrative divisions of China.

==Yugoslavia==
The federal republics of Socialist Yugoslavia were perceived as nation-states of the constitutional peoples. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, only Bosnia and Herzegovina was not defined in its constitution as a nation-state of its titular nation.

<doc id="1147799" wikidata="Q6117386" url="?curid=1147799" title="Jackson State killings">
<text>The Jackson State killings occurred on May 15, 1970, at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. On May 14, 1970, city and state police confronted a group of students outside a campus dormitory. Shortly after midnight, the police opened fire, killing two students and injuring twelve. The event happened 11 days after the Kent State shootings, in which National Guardsmen killed four students at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest against the Vietnam War. The Kent State event had first captured national attention.

== Timeline ==
On the evening of Thursday, May 14, a group of around 100 black students had gathered on Lynch Street (named after the black Reconstruction era US Representative John R. Lynch), which bisected the campus. African-American youths were reportedly pelting rocks at white motorists driving down this road—frequently the site of confrontations between white and black Jackson residents.

Tensions rose higher when a rumor spread around campus that Charles Evers—a local politician, civil rights leader and the brother of slain activist Medgar Evers—and his wife had been killed, according to &quot;Lynch Street: The May 1970 Slayings at Jackson State College&quot;. The situation escalated when a non-Jackson State student set a dump truck on fire.&quot;

The police responded in force. At least 75 police officers from the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Highway Patrol attempted to control the crowd while firemen extinguished the fires. After firefighters left the scene shortly before midnight, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women&#x27;s dormitory.

Advancing to within 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) of the crowd, officers at roughly 12:05 a.m opened fire on the dormitory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact cause of the shooting and the moments leading up to it are unclear. Authorities say they saw a sniper on one of the building&#x27;s upper floors and were being shot at from all directions. Later, two city policemen and one state patrolman reported minor injuries from flying glass. An FBI search for evidence of sniper fire found none. Students later claimed that they had not provoked the officers. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds. with more than 460 shots being fired by a reported 40 state highway patrolmen, who used shotguns from a distance of 30 to 50 feet. Every window was shattered by gunfire on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street.

The crowd scattered, and a number of people were trampled, or cut by falling glass. Phillip Lafayette Gibbs, 21, a junior, and James Earl Green, 17, a senior and miler at nearby Jim Hill High School, were killed, and twelve others were wounded. Gibbs was fatally shot near Alexander Hall by buckshot, and Green was killed behind the police line in front of B. F. Roberts Hall, also by shotgun.

== Aftermath ==
President Richard Nixon established the President&#x27;s Commission on Campus Unrest to investigate both the Jackson State and Kent State events. Public hearings were held in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and at Kent State. No arrests were made in connection with the deaths at Jackson State, but the Commission concluded &quot;that the 28-second fusillade from police officers was an unreasonable, unjustified overreaction... A broad barrage of gunfire in response to reported and unconfirmed sniper fire is never warranted.&quot;

The university has memorialized the occurrence by naming the area of the shootings the Gibbs-Green Plaza, after the two young men killed. The plaza is a large, multi-level brick and concrete patio and mall on the eastern side of the school&#x27;s campus; it borders J. R. Lynch Street and links Alexander Hall to the University Green. A large stone monument in front of Alexander Hall near the plaza also honors the two victims. Damage is still visible on the façade of Alexander Hall; it was caused by the rounds fired by the police.

In December 1970, a federal grand jury was discharged after it had failed to produce an indictment or written findings in a five-month recess. It had summoned about 40 state patrolmen and 26 city police officers.

A long-awaited formal public apology was granted at Jackson State University&#x27;s 2021 commencement. The apology reflected 51 years of contemplation regarding the event, now historically known as “The Jackson State Killings.” 
Gibbs and Green were awarded posthumous honorary doctorate degrees at the ceremony, which were accepted by family members on their behalf. 
Commencement speakers represented local and state leaders of Mississippi: Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson, and State Senator Hillman Terome Frazier. The leaders said that the formal apology was to &quot;…publicly atone for the sins of our past and proclaim a new identity of dignity, equity and justice&quot;.

<text>Chiroscience Group Plc was a British-based biotech company, founded by Christopher Evans. The company was taken over by Celltech in 1999, which was acquired in 2004 by UCB.

==History==
Chiroscience was born from the demise of the company Enzymatix, which was ultimately acquired by Genzyme, when Andrew Richards joined the company and convinced Evans and Peter Keen to launch Chiros, which name was quickly revised to Chrioscience. Seed funding for the company of was provided by Schroder Ventures, Apax and 3i. Chiroscience became one of the first biotechnology Initial Public Offerings in the United Kingdom in 1994.

In 1996, the company merged with the American biotech company &quot;Darwin Molecular Corporation&quot;, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, retaining Chiroscience as its name.

By the time of its merger with Celltech in 1999, both Chris Evans and Peter Keen had left the company, leaving Andrew Richards as the sole remaining founder and member of the original management board.

<doc id="1147817" wikidata="Q4800775" url="?curid=1147817" title="Arthur Young (police officer)">
<text>Colonel Sir Arthur Edwin Young (15 February 1907 – 20 January 1979) was a British police officer. He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and was also the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be styled Chief Constable. Young was instrumental in the creation of the post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

In the early 1950s, Young played a key role in the decolonisation of policing in the British Empire. His exit from Kenya at the end of 1954 became a political scandal and &quot;cause célèbre&quot;. During the 1960s, he led the way in modernising British police recruitment and in improving the training of senior officers.

Clive Emsley commented:

Young shared the heroic vision of the British Bobby and was always focussed on the idea that police officers should enjoy good, even friendly relations with the people that they served.

Young gained a reputation as the &quot;policeman&#x27;s policeman&quot;, associated with his concerns for the conditions of work of serving police officers. He liked to use it of himself.

==Early life and education==
Young was born at 55 Chamberlayne Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, one of four children of Edwin Young (1878–1936), a builder and contractor, and his wife Gertrude Mary (née Brown; 1880–1945). He attended Mayville Preparatory School, Southsea from 1912 to 1915 and then Portsmouth Grammar School from 1915 to 1924.

Aged sixteen, Young left school to join the Portsmouth Borough Police, against his family&#x27;s wishes.

==Early police career==
===Portsmouth Police===
Young&#x27;s father&#x27;s business partner John Henry Corke secured him an initial placement in the office of Chief Constable Thomas Davies in December 1924. Young had the post of cadet clerk. On the advice of the chief constable, he first took a course in business and accountancy.

Appointed a constable in May 1925, he became the coroner&#x27;s officer in April 1932. In June 1932, aged 25, he became the youngest detective sergeant in the United Kingdom, serving with the Northern Division CID. During his time there, he led investigations into murder, blackmail, fraud and arson. He headed the enquiries into the UK&#x27;s first case of manslaughter arising from the use of an aeroplane. Simultaneously, he began to take an ever more prominent involvement in the many royal visits to Portsmouth; when Haile Selassie visited the dockyard in September 1937, he acted as his personal escort and French interpreter. During these years, Young was also entrusted with what he later cryptically termed &quot;enquiries concerning the activities of subversive persons and propaganda, and also with other matters affecting state security&quot;. It was also during these years that he acquired his passion for ever better police equipment and his personal love of new gadgets.

Young was promoted to inspector in June 1937 and appointed to Portsmouth&#x27;s Southern Division. In Eastney and Southsea, he gained his first taste of the complexity of the problems created by traffic, of measures to be taken for its efficient control and of the need to promote road safety. A keen motorist (who progressed from a motorcycle to a series of fast cars), he took a pragmatic approach.

===Leamington Spa Borough Police===
Young wanted to head his own force. After one unsuccessful attempt, for the chief constableship of the Isle of Wight Constabulary, he became acting chief constable of Leamington Spa Borough Police in September 1938, aged 31, at a salary of £500 per annum. One year later, he was appointed to the permanent post of chief constable. In his first nine months in post, he secured an increase of twelve in the force&#x27;s establishment of 45. He also reorganised the borough&#x27;s fire brigade.

Among other innovations, Young set up twelve of the then new &quot;police pillars&quot;. They were a network of two-way microphone handsets across the borough, enabling the public to contact police stations and civil defence posts directly. The base of the pillar contained first aid equipment while, a Leamington innovation, a flashing red light on the top called up policemen on patrol.
After the Coventry Blitz of November 1940, Young was seconded by the Home Office for six months to run the Coventry City Police, the chief constable being fully occupied as civil defence controller. He introduced there a &quot;good neighbour scheme&quot; for civilians who had been bombed out that he had previously set up in Leamington.

===Birmingham City Police===
Young made several unsuccessful applications for promotion: the East Riding of Yorkshire Constabulary in 1939, Portsmouth City Police in 1940, Oxford City Police in 1940). In 1941 he was selected as senior assistant chief constable of Birmingham City Police. The chief constable (1941–45) was William Clarence Johnson.

It was in Birmingham that Young began with police training. He also established in 1942 a radio telephone system linking police stations and police cars.

==Wartime service==
In February 1943, Young was one of a number of chief constables seconded to the War Office&#x27;s Civil Affairs Training Centre and attended the first course for senior officers. Before the course was finished, he was transferred to the instructing staff and in June 1943 he was appointed the first commandant of the new Police Civil Affairs Training Centre at Peel House in London (gazetted with the rank of lieutenant-colonel) and charged with the task of setting up the training school for policemen and provost officers. Their duties would be to maintain law and order in Axis territory as it was liberated by Allied forces. 

Shortly afterwards, Young was promoted colonel, and moved in July 1943 to be senior British police officer in the Mediterranean Theatre. He was stationed in North Africa awaiting the Allied invasion of Sicily. After the invasion, he worked in the Allied Control Commission for Italy. In December 1943 he was given the role of director of the security branch of the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories. His post with the Control Commission in Italy lasted to 1945. The approaches Young developed in Italy were adapted elsewhere Allied occupied Europe in 1944–1945. He considered his major personal achievement was reorganising the Carabinieri.

==Post-war police service==
Young was appointed Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary in 1944; but he was not demobilised until 1945. He emphasised pay and conditions for his officers. In 1946 he wrote

:&quot;I hold the view that the police organisation is not a police force but a police service, which offers to the right individual not merely a job but all the advantages of a professional career. I believe in doing everything reasonably possible by way of improving the conditions and amenities for all ranks of the service, and in particular in delegating both authority and responsibility to officers according to their rank. Having done this I am prepared to accept nothing but the highest standard of service by way of return.&quot;

He was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe to consider the wireless needs of all forces. At this period he became re-acquainted with the politician James Callaghan, from Portsmouth, now a junior minister at the Ministry of Transport.

Young applied unsuccessfully to be chief constable of Kent in 1946. Through Home Secretary James Chuter Ede he was appointed in 1947 Assistant Commissioner &quot;D&quot; of the Metropolitan Police in London, in charge of organisation, recruitment, training and communications. Things, however, did not go well, since colleagues shunned him. Then Young was the first former police constable to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the City of London, in March 1950. He held the post to 1971.

==Colonial police reforms of the 1950s==
In 1948, W. C. Johnson, Young&#x27;s old chief from Birmingham, was appointed to the Colonial Office, as police advisor to the Colonial secretary. From 1949, he was Inspector-General of Colonial Police. He left that position in 1951 and was succeeded by his assistant George Abbiss. The post was an innovation, created with as its motivations both Cold War fear of communist influence, and the wish (clearly signalled and raising concern in colonial forces) to bring colonial policing into line with British practice.

Young was sent on colonial missions for police reform. First came a short period in the Gold Coast. The Convention People&#x27;s Party was arousing police interest, ahead of the 1951 Gold Coast general election. Young was there in 1950, for two months, with Chief Superintendent Wilson of the Metropolitan Police, and wrote a substantial report for Matthew Collens, the inspector-general of police.

===Malaya===
In 1952–1953, Young was seconded to the Federation of Malaya as its commissioner of police, during the Emergency. He arrived in February 1952, bringing again Chief Superintendent Wilson who was to train uniformed police. In broad terms Gerald Templer and Young conformed to the &quot;Briggs Plan&quot;, proposed by Harold Rawdon Briggs, for resettling rural Chinese-Malayans. Success was obtained from 1952 onwards in limiting the insurgency. Young chose his successor, William Carbonell, without regard to seniority.

===Kenya===
In 1954, Young undertook a further secondment, in Kenya as commissioner of police during the Mau Mau rebellion. He followed the parliamentary delegation that went to Kenya in January 1954, led by Walter Elliot and Arthur Bottomley, and reported some months later. Oliver Lyttleton, the Colonial Secretary, visited Kenya three times in the period 1952–4, before resigning from the third Churchill ministry in July 1954. Young arrived in Kenya in March of that year, and immediately required that policing should be carried out with minimal physical force. 

Young appointed Duncan MacPherson (1912–1989) from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force as head of CID, to investigate allegations against the army, police and Kikuyu Home Guard. From 1951 CID had been under John Timmerman, a Canadian RCMP and WWII intelligence officer who was assistant police commissioner, brought in to reorganise it, and who from 1955 worked for the Department of External Affairs in security. The trial on 10 December 1954 for perjury of George Horsfall of the Kenya Police, and Derek Searle of the Reserve, was met by demands for an inquiry from Reserve officers into CID methods.

Young resigned after less than eight months. He saw widespread interference of the executive in policing. His resignation letter to Evelyn Baring was suppressed. His replacement was Richard Catling, a sceptic when it came to George Erskine&#x27;s policy on detention of Kikuyu. He had arrived from Malaya in April as a deputy commissioner and police trainer. John Whyatt, Attorney-General of Kenya and an ally of Young, was made Chief Justice of Singapore in 1955.

Before leaving Kenya, Young asked MacPherson to compile a concise file of issues with Baring&#x27;s administration: it was not circulated, but Young used his Anglican contacts to make the content known. Karl Hack reports Young&#x27;s resignation as driven by the failure to have murders by the Kikuyu Home Guard investigated. He comments also on the differences between Malaya and Kenya, stating that in Young&#x27;s view efforts to make policing &quot;friendly to the public&quot; initially had failed in the latter, having largely succeeded in the former.

On his return to the United Kingdom, Young met privately with the clerical activist Michael Scott and the politician Barbara Castle. He made no move to publicise his views. The Christian Council of Kenya was split, with David Steel moved by Young&#x27;s departure, coupled with a raid on Mombasa&#x27;s YMCA, to preach strongly against Baring&#x27;s administration in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Nairobi; while Leonard Beecher opposed him. Steel brought the Church Missionary Society (CMS) into his camp. On 22 December 1954, Lord Ogmore asked in the House of Lords if the government would make a statement on Young&#x27;s resignation. Behind the scenes, while talking to the Colonial Office about a non-disclosure agreement, Young briefed against Baring to Kenneth George Grubb of the CMS, and encouraged the CMS missionary Thomas Francis Cecil Bewes to keep up the pressure. Grubb wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, published 22 January 1955. Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, met Baring during December 1954, but Beecher asked him to leave matters to the churches in Kenya. He was in discussions with Frederick Crawford, acting Governor, and considered church leaders bound by undertakings of confidentiality.

In the House of Lords on 10 February 1955, William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt cited a &quot;Times&quot; report of the East African Court of Appeal, in which it was stated that the authority of detention teams could not be fathomed in law. He said &quot;It is in that context that I find disquieting the sending out of Colonel Young to investigate the affairs of the police and his coming back for some reason which I do not fully understand.&quot; Bottomley challenged the Colonial Secretary, by then Alan Lennox-Boyd, on 16 March 1955 in a House of Commons debate on colonial affairs, stating that &quot;there has been no satisfactory explanation yet of the resignation of Colonel Young&quot;. In a 1959 debate on the Hola massacre, Castle accused Lennox-Boyd of repeated cover-ups, and suppression of reports including Young&#x27;s. She also quoted from MacPherson, who had remained in Kenya for two years after Young had left. He had been told by Young&#x27;s successor as commissioner of police to stop investigations into camp deaths.

==Royal Ulster Constabulary==
In November 1969 Young was seconded to be the last inspector-general and the first chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. James Callaghan, then Home Secretary, sent him to implement the Hunt Report. Young&#x27;s measures introduced the standard British rank system for police officers in Northern Ireland and disbanded the Ulster Special Constabulary. In his tenure to 1970, he gained the approval of nationalists. Georgina Sinclair has argued that he was overly influenced by arguments put to him by constitutional Irish nationalists.

==Views and other positions==
Improved pay and conditions and professional standards were Young&#x27;s constant pre-occupations. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At national level, he ran command courses and saw through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates.

Young fought for the recruitment and promotion of women. He resisted the traditional placement of military officers into police commands; and opposed Lord Trenchard&#x27;s approach in his 1932 Commissioner&#x27;s Report, base on &quot;promoting from within wasn&#x27;t working&quot;, as inappropriate for the British police service. He ran an adroit campaign from 1960 on the police inspectorate, aimed at the Royal Commission on the Police. It dealt with opposition to innovation. Sir Charles Cunningham then blocked Young&#x27;s selection as the first Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Young chaired the Police Council for the UK, the Association of Chief Police Officers training centres committee and the education committee of the National Police Fund. He was a governor of the Police College and of Atlantic College, and a member of the committees of the Police Advisory Board, the National Police Fund, the Royal Humane Society, the National Rifle Association, the National Scout Council, and the Thames Group Hospitals. He was president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 1962.

==Family==
Young married three times. 

#In 1939, he married Ivy Ada May Hammond (1909–1956), a nurse; they had a son. She had trained at the Royal Portsmouth Hospital, meeting Young there when he was a police constable.
#In 1957, he married Margaret Furnival Homan, née Dolphin (died 1966).
#In 1970, he married Ileen Fryer Turner (née Rayner). She died on 31 December 2002.

==Death==
Young died at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London, on 20 January 1979. After cremation, his ashes were scattered at Beachy Head.

==Awards and honours==
Young was awarded the King&#x27;s Police Medal (KPM) in the 1952 New Year Honours. The following year, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1953 Coronation Honours &quot;for services as Commissioner of Police, Federation of Malaya&quot; and was further appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1962 Birthday Honours. He was knighted in the 1965 Birthday Honours, and was formally conferred with his knighthood by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on 16 November of that year. For his work in Northern Ireland he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1971 New Year Honours.

<text>This is an incomplete list of men&#x27;s [[Australian rules football]] leagues in Australia.

There is also a Victorian only list of former Associations and Leagues too. In the early 1900s a lot of club&#x27;s would move from one association to another and other football associations would be formed amongst nearby small rural clubs and towns.

There are active leagues in all states and territories for senior players.

For Women&#x27;s Australian rules football see List of Australian rules football leagues in Australia 
:See Also &quot;&#x27;List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia&quot;

For [[Rec Footy]] (social non-contact) competitions, see Rec Footy#List of AFL Rec Footy Competitions.

<text>The current yield, interest yield, income yield, flat yield, market yield, mark to market yield or running yield is a financial term used in reference to bonds and other fixed-interest securities such as gilts. It is the ratio of the annual interest (coupon) payment and the bond&#x27;s price:

formula_1 

== Example ==
The current yield of a bond with a face value (F) of $100 and a coupon rate (r) of 5.00% that is selling at $95.00 (clean; not including accrued interest) (P) is calculated as follows.

formula_2

== Shortcomings of current yield ==
The current yield refers only to the yield of the bond at the current moment. It does not reflect the total return over the life of the bond, or the factors affecting total return, such as:
* the length of time over which the bond produces cash flows for the investor (the maturity date of the bond), 
* interest earned on reinvested coupon payments, or reinvestment risk (the uncertainty about the rate at which future cash flows can be reinvested), and 
* fluctuations in the market price of a bond prior to maturity.

== Relationship between yield to maturity and coupon rate ==
The concept of current yield is closely related to other bond concepts, including yield to maturity (YTM), and coupon yield. When a coupon-bearing bond sells at;

* a discount: YTM &gt; current yield &gt; coupon yield
* a premium: coupon yield &gt; current yield &gt; YTM
* par: YTM = current yield = coupon yield.

For zero-coupon bonds selling at a discount, the coupon yield and current yield are zero, and the YTM is positive.

<text>The National Museum of Flight is Scotland&#x27;s national aviation museum, at East Fortune Airfield, just south of the village of East Fortune, Scotland. It is one of the museums within National Museums Scotland. 

The museum is housed in the original wartime buildings of RAF East Fortune which is a well preserved World War II airfield. As a result of this the entire site is a scheduled monument with no permanent structures added by the museum. The hangars, control tower and stores were designated as Category B listed buildings by Historic Scotland, but this designation was removed in 2013 as they were already covered by the stricter scheduling.

==Museum history==

The collections date back to 1909 when the Royal Scottish Museum acquired Percy Pilcher&#x27;s Hawk glider. This was the first aircraft collected by any museum in the United Kingdom. The same year the museum acquired models of the Wright Model A and Blériot XI. During the early 1920s several aero engines were added to the collection, including a 1910 33 hp Wright engine donated by Orville Wright. In 1968 a Slingsby Gull sailplane was acquired. In 1971 the museum was given a Supermarine Spitfire XVI by the Ministry of Defence. This could not be displayed in Edinburgh and was stored in a hangar at East Fortune. 

The following year a Hawker Sea Hawk, de Havilland Sea Vampire and de Havilland Sea Venom were received from RNAS Lossiemouth. The growth in the aircraft collection led to the decision to open a Museum of Flight at East Fortune, with the public admitted for the first time on 7 July 1975. 

The displays included several aircraft on loan, including de Havilland Dragon Rapide (G-ADAH), BA Swallow (G-AEVZ) and Fairey Delta 2 WG774. In 1979 a temporary exhibition about the R34 airship was mounted, followed by &quot;Fighters of the RFC and RAF, 1914 to 1940&quot; the following year. The 1981 temporary exhibition was &quot;The Flight of Rudolf Hess 1941.&quot;
The museum expanded significantly in 1981 as a result of the sale by auction of much of the Strathallan Collection of aircraft. The museum purchased five aircraft (Bristol Fairchild Bolingbroke, de Havilland Dragon, de Havilland Puss Moth, General Aircraft Cygnet and Percival Provost). Of these, the Cygnet and Provost were the first aircraft to make their final flights to join the museum. That same year, the de Havilland Comet also flew in to the museum, as did the Avro Vulcan in 1984. Another significant expansion took place with the donation of much of the British Airways Collection of aircraft in 2006. This collection was previously displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. The museum acquired the BAC 1-11, Vickers Viscount, Boeing 707 forward fuselage and Hawker Siddeley Trident cockpit. Visitors are able to walk through the 1-11 and 707 and look into the flight deck of the Trident. This is in addition to walking through the de Havilland Comet and Jetstream 31 fuselage which were already in the museum collections.

A £3.6million project, completed in 2016, installed heating and insulation for the first time to two hangars that were built in 1940.

==Collections==

The museum collections have expanded into one of the most important in the UK, covering all aspects of aviation including military, civil and recreational. The museum is significant in that it is the only UK national museum still collecting the history of commercial aviation. This resulted in the museum putting their Boeing 707 fuselage section on display from April 2010, with a collection of BOAC crew and passenger artefacts, including a 1960s stewardess uniform.
A list of the aircraft in the collection is given on the museum website. The aircraft on display are:

===Other exhibitions===
Additional permanent exhibitions were opened in recent years in other wartime buildings on the site, with a hands-on interactive gallery about flight called &quot;Fantastic Flight&quot; and another dealing with the history of the site called &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;. There is also a restored parachute packing building, called &quot;The Parachute Store&quot;. Other buildings house various exhibits including a Green Goddess, and an AEC Matador used by the RAF in Malta.

==Events==

The museum has played host to Scotland’s National Airshow which was an annual airshow held every July, usually on the third Saturday of the month. The 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions and in early 2022 it was announced that the airshow would be put on hold indefinitely. Other events are run throughout the year. These include &quot;Wartime Experience&quot; held in May and &quot;Wheels and Wings&quot;, a transport event held in September.

<text>BOOMERanG experiment (Balloon Observations Of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation And Geophysics) was an experiment that flew a telescope on a (high-altitude) balloon and measured the cosmic microwave background radiation of a part of the sky during three sub-orbital flights. It was the first experiment to make large, high-fidelity images of the CMB temperature anisotropies, and is best known for the discovery in 2000 that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, with similar results from the competing MAXIMA experiment.

By using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high, it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a tiny part of the sky could be scanned.

The first was a test flight over North America in 1997. In the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic. It was carried by the Polar vortex winds in a circle around the South Pole, returning after two weeks. From this phenomenon the telescope took its name.

The BOOMERanG team was led by Andrew E. Lange of Caltech and Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome La Sapienza.

==Instrumentation==
The experiment uses bolometers for radiation detection. These bolometers are kept at a temperature of 0.27 kelvin. At this temperature the material has a very low heat capacity according to the Debye law, thus incoming microwave light will cause a large temperature change, proportional to the intensity of the incoming waves, which is measured with sensitive thermometers.

An off-axis 1.3-meter primary mirror focuses the microwaves onto the focal plane, which consist of 16 horns. These horns, operating at 145 GHz, 245 GHz and 345 GHz, are arranged into 8 pixels. Only a tiny fraction of the sky can be seen concurrently, so the telescope must rotate to scan the whole field of view.

==Results==

Together with experiments like the Saskatoon experiment, MAT/TOCO, MAXIMA, and others, the BOOMERanG data from 1997 and 1998 determined the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering with high precision. When combined with complementary data regarding the value of Hubble&#x27;s constant, the Boomerang data determined the geometry of the Universe to be flat, supporting the supernova evidence for the existence of dark energy. The 2003 flight of Boomerang resulted in extremely high signal-to-noise ratio maps of the CMB temperature anisotropy, and a measurement of the polarization of the CMB.

<doc id="1147855" wikidata="Q3935813" url="?curid=1147855" title="Vibrational energy relaxation">
<text>Vibrational energy relaxation, or vibrational population relaxation, is a process in which the population distribution of molecules in quantum states of high energy level caused by an external perturbation returns to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

In solution, the process proceeds with intra- and intermolecular energy transfer. The excess energy of the excited vibrational mode is transferred to the kinetic modes in the same molecule or to the surrounding molecules. Through this process, the initially excited vibrational mode moves to a vibrational state of a lower energy. The relaxation is called the longitudinal relaxation, and the time constant of the relaxation is called the longitudinal relaxation time, or &quot;T&quot;1.

Vibrational energy relaxation has been studied with time-resolved spectroscopy. By the excitation of the pump pulse, the population distribution of the vibrationally excited state is made by infrared absorption or a Raman process when the molecule is in the electronic ground state. In addition, by the electronic transition, the molecule often moves to the vibrationally excited state of the electronic excited state. The process of the energy relaxation from these vibrationally excited states can be observed with the probe pulse, which is delayed from the pump pulse.

<text>The AVCEN Jetpod was a design proposal for a very quiet aircraft that could take off and land in short distances (STOL), developed by Avcen Limited, a company incorporated on 18 October 1988 which became a subsidiary of the Hong Kong–based company, Profit Sky Group Ltd. 

A number of applications were proposed, including as a military transport, an executive transport, and as a short to medium-range air taxi. Avcen Limited was the British-based headquarters while Avcen Limited Malaysia was based at Patimas Technology Centre, Technology Park, Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur. According to Avcen&#x27;s publicity materials, the Jetpod&#x27;s maximum speed was designed to be . It would need only to take-off or land, allowing runways to be constructed close to the center of major cities, and would be sufficiently quiet to not be noticeable above city traffic. 

At 12:30 p.m. on the 16th of August, 2009 a just-completed prototype Jetpod crashed, killing the founder of Avcen, Michael Robert Dacre, who was the sole occupant. Dacre had attempted to take off three times and on the fourth successfully lifted off and climbed to 200 meters. then the aircraft became uncontrollable and crashed. According to Taiping deputy police chief Syed A. Wahab Syed A. Majid, the company had not obtained permission from the Royal Malaysian Air Force to conduct the flight tests.

<text>Sharon Kathleen Sheeley (April 4, 1940 – May 17, 2002) was an American songwriter who wrote songs for Glen Campbell, Ricky Nelson, Brenda Lee, and Eddie Cochran.

==Biography==
Sheeley attended Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, and briefly worked as a teen model. She went to Hollywood to meet the stars and write songs. Her first song, &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot;, was recorded by Ricky Nelson in 1958, and became Nelson&#x27;s first US No. 1 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s first No. 1. At age 18, Sheeley was the youngest woman to write an American number-one hit.

Jerry Capehart, the manager and songwriting partner of Eddie Cochran, then agreed to look after Sheeley&#x27;s interests, and she and Cochran began a relationship. She wrote &quot;Love Again&quot; and &quot;Cherished Memories&quot; for Cochran and the 1959 hit &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; with Eddie&#x27;s brother Bill Cochran. Her other songwriting credits included &quot;Hurry Up&quot;, recorded by Ritchie Valens.

In April 1960, she traveled to United Kingdom to join Cochran and Gene Vincent, who were touring there. She and Cochran were reported as being &quot;unofficially engaged&quot;. She recorded a song, &quot;Homework&quot;, with producer Jack Good. On the night of April 16, 1960, Sheeley, Vincent and Cochran were traveling in a private hire taxi from a concert in Bristol to London Heathrow Airport when it slammed into a lamp post near Chippenham. All three were rushed to a hospital. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered fatal brain injuries and died the next day, at the age of 21. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis, and Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and added further damage to his already weak leg.

Following the accident she returned to the US, where she collaborated with musician-songwriter Jackie DeShannon on a string of hits, including Brenda Lee&#x27;s &quot;Dum Dum&quot; and &quot;Heart in Hand&quot;, The Fleetwoods&#x27; &quot;(He&#x27;s) The Great Imposter&quot; and Irma Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;. She also co-wrote songs with Chris Curtis of The Searchers, including &quot;Night Time&quot; recorded by Paul and Barry Ryan.

In 1961, Sheeley married Los Angeles radio personality Jimmy O&#x27;Neill. The two created the ABC TV series &quot;Shindig!&quot; (1964–1966). They divorced five years after marrying, but remained friends. After her divorce, Sheeley moved away from the music scene, apart from some public appearances at Eddie Cochran conventions in the 1990s. In August 2000, RPM Records released a collection of her songs that were recorded in the early 1960s by session musicians, including Glen Campbell, Delaney Bramlett, Leon Russell, David Gates, Hal Blaine and Herb Alpert.

==Death==
Five days after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, Sheeley died on May 17, 2002, at Sherman Oaks Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 62.
She has a cenotaph marker next to Eddie Cochran at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cypress, in Orange County, California.

==Media==
In 1988, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. promoted their Levi&#x27;s 501 range with a television commercial called &quot;Eddie Cochran&quot;, directed by Syd Macartney. It told the story of how Sheeley (played by actress Sharon Devlin) attracted Cochran at a party by wearing said product. It was seemingly narrated by Sheeley and the background song, &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran&#x27;s hits.

Sheeley was depicted by Rosanna Locke in the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba.&quot;

<doc id="1147864" wikidata="Q318885" url="?curid=1147864" title="Mako (actor)">
<text>was a Japanese-American actor, credited mononymously in almost all of his acting roles as simply Mako (マコ). His career in film, on television, and on stage spanned five decades and 165 productions. He was an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award and Tony Award nominee.

Born and raised in Kobe, Mako moved to the United States after the Second World War, where his dissident parents had moved to escape political persecution. After serving with the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he trained in acting at the Pasadena Playhouse and later co-founded the East West Players. His role as Po-Han (his second credited role on film) in the 1966 film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; saw him nominated for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

His other various roles included Kichijiro in the 1971 film adaptation of &quot;Silence&quot;, Oomiak &quot;The Fearless One&quot; in &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot; (1974), Akiro the Wizard in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) and &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984), and Kungo Tsarong in &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997). He was part of the original cast of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 1976 Broadway musical &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, which earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Later in his career, he became well known for his voice-acting roles, including Mr. Yamaguchi in &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, Aku in the first four seasons of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; (2001–04), and Iroh in the first two seasons of &quot;&quot; (–).

He died on July 21, 2006, at the age of 72 from esophageal cancer.

==Early life and education==
Mako was born Makoto Iwamatsu in Kobe, Japan, the son of children&#x27;s authors and illustrators Tomoe Sasako and Atsushi Iwamatsu, better known by their pen names Mitsu and Taro Yashima. In 1939, his parents, who were political dissidents, moved to the United States, leaving Mako in the care of his grandmother. Because his parents lived on the East Coast, they were not interned during World War II; instead they opted to work for the U.S. Office of War Information and were later granted residency. They arranged for him to join them in 1949, when he was fifteen years old.

Iwamatsu&#x27;s father owned an art studio in New York City, and as a teenager, he became acquainted with painter Hiroshi Honda. Though he faced racial discrimination, Iwamatsu bonded with his high-school peers over baseball, and was scouted by the Cleveland Indians.

Though he had an interest in dramatics, Iwamatsu did not believe an artistic career was financially viable, and enrolled in the Pratt Institute School of Architecture while working in his father&#x27;s print shop.

He later enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1953 and served until October 1955, during which he performed in plays for his fellow soldiers. He then trained at the Pasadena Playhouse and adopted the mononym Mako, as he found most people had difficulty pronouncing his full name. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1956.

==Career==
===Film===
Mako&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;Never So Few&quot; (1959). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as engine-room worker Po-Han in the film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966). His other roles include the Chinese contract laborer Mun Ki in the epic movie &quot;The Hawaiians&quot; (1970) starring Charlton Heston and Tina Chen; Oomiak, the Inuit guide, in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot; (1974); Yuen Chung in the film &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (1975) directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring James Caan, Robert Duvall, and martial artist Takayuki Kubota; the sorcerer Nakano in &quot;Highlander III: The Sorcerer&quot;; Jackie Chan&#x27;s uncle/&quot;sifu&quot; in Chan&#x27;s first American movie &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; (1980); the wizard Akiro opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in the two Conan movies &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;; the confidant to Chuck Norris&#x27; rogue cop in the thriller &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot; (1982); and the Japanese spy in the comedy &quot;Under the Rainbow&quot;. In 1990, he had a minor role in the psychological thriller &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; along with Matthew Modine, Melanie Griffith, and Michael Keaton; Yoshida-san in &quot;Rising Sun&quot;; Mr. Lee in &quot;Sidekicks&quot;; Kanemitsu in &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; (1993); and Kungo Tsarong in &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997).

In 1965, frustrated by the limited roles available to Asian-American actors, Mako and six others formed the East West Players theater company, first performing out of a church basement. During the company&#x27;s 1981 season, to coincide with the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians&#x27; hearings on redress, Mako exclusively produced plays about the Japanese-American incarceration. He remained artistic director of the company until 1989.

Mako&#x27;s Broadway career included creating the roles of the Reciter, the &quot;shōgun&quot;, and the Chicago-based inventor of the rickshaw, in the original 1976 production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. Mako&#x27;s landlord at the time, Jerry Orbach, was also nominated for his role in &quot;Chicago&quot;; both lost, however, to George Rose from the revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Mako recalled being awoken at 4:30 in the morning after the Tony ceremony by Orbach, who was shouting from the floor below: &quot;Hey, Mako! What the fuck happened? I can&#x27;t believe it; we lost to a fucking revival!&quot;. Mako reprised the role and directed the musical&#x27;s production with the East West Players, and further reprised the role in a production at the San Jose Civic Light Opera in 1991.

In 1974, he appeared in the &quot;Ironside&quot; episode &quot;Terror on Grant Avenue&quot;. He appeared as a Japanese chef in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Murder Under Glass&quot; (1978).

He also voiced Achoo (a parody of Aku) and the annoying alarm clock Happy Cat in a &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;-parodying episode of &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; entitled &quot;Samurai Quack&quot;. He provided the introductory voice for the ending theme of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and voiced Iroh in the first two seasons of &quot;&quot; from to .

<text>Sir David Iser Smith, (9 August 1933 – 15 August 2022) was an Australian public servant. He was the Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia between 1973 and 1990, in which capacity he served Sir Paul Hasluck, Sir John Kerr, Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen and Bill Hayden.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Melbourne to Polish Jewish immigrant parents named Szmitkowski which was then anglicised to &quot;Smith&quot;. He was educated at Princes Hill State School, Scotch College, the University of Melbourne, and the Australian National University, where he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree.

Smith began his career in the Australian Public Service in 1953, and was later appointed Private Secretary to the Minister for Interior and Works from 1958 until 1963. He was then appointed Secretary to the Federal Executive Council and head of the Government Branch, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, from 1971 to 1973.

==Secretary to the Governor-General==
In January 1973, Smith was appointed acting Official Secretary to Sir Paul Hasluck, and on 20 July was made permanent Official Secretary. He later became the first Secretary of the Order of Australia on its establishment in 1975. After Hasluck&#x27;s retirement, he served Sir John Kerr.

Smith held office at the time of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis when, on 11 November 1975, Kerr dismissed the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. Smith was required to read out the proclamation of the dissolution of parliament, in formal dress, on the steps of the then Parliament House. The dismissal was by then publicly known, and an angry crowd of Whitlam supporters had gathered, filling the steps and spilling over into the roadway and Parliament House itself. Smith was forced to enter Parliament House through a side door and make his way to the steps from the inside. He read the proclamation, although the crowd&#x27;s boos and chanting (&quot;We want Gough!&quot;) drowned him out. It ended:

Whitlam, who had been standing on the step behind Smith, immediately addressed the gathered media scrum and crowd with words that famously proclaimed his defiance:

Smith served as Official Secretary until 1990, serving Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen, and Bill Hayden. He was later appointed a Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University for 1998 and 1999, and was a member of the 1998 Constitutional Convention.

==Views on the monarchy and Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal==
In a lecture on &quot;An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective&quot;, published as &quot;Papers on Parliament No. 27&quot;, March 1996, Smith mentioned that, in a previous lecture, Senator Baden Teague had spoken of the Queen as Australia&#x27;s head of state and argued for her replacement by an Australian head of state, and that in his replies to questions after the lecture Teague had spoken of the Governor-General as &quot;our head of state&quot;. Smith remarked that the switch from Queen to Governor‑General was &quot;entirely automatic and unselfconscious&quot;, and that Teague was &quot;not alone in his ambivalence&quot;. After mentioning other public references made to the Governor-General as head of state, Smith opined &quot;The fact is that under our Constitution we have two heads of state—a symbolic head of state in the Sovereign, and a constitutional head of state in the Governor-General&quot;, and said that in his lecture he would discuss the roles of the Sovereign and of the Governor-General under the Australian Constitution, including some of the changes which had occurred in each of those roles since Federation. To conclude the lecture, Smith quoted the remarks of Sir Gerard Brennan, Chief Justice of Australia, on the oaths of allegiance and office:

After retiring from public service, Sir David became a member of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and frequently gave addresses on constitutional matters. He has strongly defended Sir John Kerr and has been highly critical of Gough Whitlam. In 2005 Smith published an account of the events of 1975 and the other constitutional debates, &quot;Head of State&quot;, which was launched by former Governor-General Bill Hayden. Smith later published his opinion that the dismissal had been the culmination of a political and not a constitutional crisis.

==Governor-General as head of state==
After his retirement in 1992, Smith asserted in books and lectures that the governor-general carries out the duties of head of state in his or her own right and not as the Queen&#x27;s representative or surrogate.

==Life in retirement; death==
Smith lived in Canberra, where in a voluntary capacity he often led guided tours at Old Parliament House. He was father to three sons, Michael (financial services, Sydney), Richard (Commonwealth public servant, Canberra), Phillip (strategic architect, ICT, Oslo, Norway).

David Smith died on 15 August 2022 at the age of 89.

==Honours==
* On 29 April 1977, Smith was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) for his continuing service as Official Secretary.

* On 9 June 1986, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for &quot;service to the Crown, as Official Secretary to the Governor-General and as Secretary of the Order of Australia&quot;.

* On 19 August 1990, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) at a private investiture at Balmoral Castle.

* On 1 January 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;services to Australian society through the Office of the Governor-General&quot;.

Smith was also appointed a Knight of the Order of St John and has been awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

<doc id="1147871" wikidata="Q2454348" url="?curid=1147871" title="Project Justice">
<text>Project Justice, also known as Project Justice: Rival Schools 2, and known in Japan as , is a 2000 3D fighting video game produced by Capcom as the sequel to &quot;Rival Schools: United By Fate&quot; (1997)&quot;.&quot; The game was released on the Sega NAOMI arcade board and Dreamcast home console initially in Japan and globally in 2001. Like its predecessor, it revolves around team battles between students of different schools and is set one year later, but teams now have three fighters instead of two and a new move mechanic called Party-Up is introduced. &quot;Project Justice&quot; received a favorable reception.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Project Justice&quot;&#x27;s fighting system is lifted from the original &quot;Rival Schools&quot;, with some notable changes. The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.

The additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent&#x27;s Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.

Additionally, the &quot;vigor&quot; meter in &quot;Project Justice&quot; is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in &quot;Rival Schools&quot;), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.

Also carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of &quot;Project Justice&quot; in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in &quot;Project Justice&quot; is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in &quot;Rival Schools&quot;. As with School Life Mode in the original &quot;Rival Schools&quot;, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of &quot;Project Justice&quot; due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.

All of the playable characters from the previous &quot;Rival Schools&quot; game return, with the exception of Raizo Imawano and guest character Sakura Kasugano, though the former appears as a non-player character in the game&#x27;s Story Mode. Five new characters are introduced, along with alternate versions of a few existing characters.

===Style===
As in the original game many of the characters use their chosen field of academic or sporting excellence as a fighting style. As a result, special moves - in particular the Two-Person team up moves - tend to have a surreal edge, with methods to injure your opponent ranging from: forcing them to take part in an impromptu bout of synchronised swimming (on dry land) (if Nagare is in your team); confusing them by taking photographs of them in rapid succession during an interview for the school newspaper (if Ran is in your team), or even berating them so severely that they fall unconscious out of shame.

&quot;Project Justice&quot;&#x27;s single player mode was structured differently from its predecessor. While &quot;Rival Schools&quot; only plays a story if characters from the same school were selected, the game instead has separate &quot;Story&quot; and &quot;Free&quot; modes. 
*In &quot;Story Mode&quot;, players select a portion of story grouped by school and play through a rigid storyline with a limited group of 2 to 6 characters that the player can choose from for each fight. Like the original game, each fight in story mode is accompanied with 2D cut scenes that advance the story. In some stories, the plot will branch out depending on the results of certain fights or decisions made by the player, changing the fights that the player faces. After fighting the boss of the game, an ending for the school&#x27;s story is shown.
*In &quot;Free Mode&quot;, players select a team of three characters and fight random teams of opponents until getting to fight the boss, similar to selecting two characters from different schools in &quot;Rival Schools&quot;. After defeating the boss, the player is shown a screen where the game rates the performance of player, and gives them a ranking named after a character from the game.

==Plot==

One year has passed since the events of &quot;Rival Schools: United By Fate&quot;, and things have gone back to normal in Aoharu City. Batsu Ichimonji, Hinata Wakaba, Kyosuke Kagami, and the rest of the fighters had resumed their normal school lives and all of them have since enjoyed the calm peace that came after their last adventure, but the peace itself doesn&#x27;t last for long as the fighters would soon find themselves getting involved in a new battle.

Kurow Kirishima: a cold-hearted and ruthless ninja assassin from a mysterious group known only as the &quot;Reverse Society&quot; has his sight set on the Imawano family and plans to eliminate them and their allies so that he can prepare for the advancement of his own ambition to rule Japan. To this end, he attacks Raizo Imawano: the principal of Justice High, father to Batsu and uncle of both Kyosuke Kagami and Hyo Imawano so that he can easily put him out of commission and not have any interference come from him. Secondly, he sends both his older sister Yurika Kirishima and his loyal subordinate Momo Karuizawa into the ranks of the fighters so that the two of them can cause tension and distrust to occur between the friends. His third plot involves brainwashing Gedo gang leader Daigo Kazama so that he can order him into forcing his gang to attack various schools in order to cause even more tension to occur. Lastly, Kurow himself plans to destroy Batsu&#x27;s reputation by disguising himself as Batsu&#x27;s doppelganger (named Vatsu) so that he can attack the fighters and make them believe that Batsu is behind it.

Batsu and his friends must fight back against the evil ambition of Kurow and attempt to not let their friendship get destroyed by the conspiracy of a deadly ninja assassin.

== Development and release ==

It was released in Japan as an arcade game in December 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast, which shares the Naomi architecture, at the same time. The U.S. version was originally slated for a February 2001 release, before it was further delayed to 16 May. 

The arcade version is set to be re-released in 2025 as part of &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many video game magazines gave the game positive reviews while it was still in development. Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Barber of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game in an early review, &quot;Unless you&#x27;re hard-up for a new fighter, you may want to rent it before making a purchase.&quot; Michael &quot;Major Mike&quot; Weigand of &quot;GamePro&quot; said in an early review, &quot;Fighting fans looking for their next challenge should spend some time with &quot;Preject Justice&quot;.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 33 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their 15 January 2001 issue as the most-successful dedicated arcade game of the previous year.

<doc id="1147872" wikidata="Q897616" url="?curid=1147872" title="Topgallant sail">
<text>On a square rigged sailing vessel, a topgallant sail (topgallant alone pronounced &quot;t&#x27;gallant&quot;, topgallant sail pronounced &quot;t&#x27;garns&#x27;l&quot;, is the square-rigged sail or sails immediately above the topsail or topsails. It is also known as a gallant or garrant sail.

Later full-rigged ships split the topsail (and often the topgallant sail) for easier handling. They thus set two topsails (and possibly two topgallant sails) per mast. The lower topgallant sail is immediately above the upper topsail. The upper or only topgallant sail is set from the top of the topgallant mast. If there is a lower topgallant it is set from midway down the topgallant mast. A staysail set on a stay running forward and downwards from the top or midpoint of the topgallant mast is called a topgallant staysail.

<text> (, ) is a Russian-language business daily newspaper published in Moscow.

==History==
 was founded in 1999 as a joint venture between Dow Jones, who publishes &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;; Pearson, who previously published the &quot;Financial Times&quot;; and Independent Media, who publishes &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;. Independent Media was acquired by Finnish media company Sanoma in 2005.

Leonid Bereshidsky was the first chief editor, till he entered INSEAD business school in 2002 and was replaced by Tatiana Lysova. From 2007 till 2010, Yelizaveta Osetinskaya served as chief editor. In 2010, she became chief editor of the online version of the newspaper. She was replaced by former chief editor Tatiana Lysova.

Sanoma sold its stake in the paper to , former chief executive of &quot;Kommersant&quot;, in April 2015. Ahead of a new Russian media ownership law prohibiting foreign enterprises from owning more than 20% of Russian media companies, Dow Jones and Pearson also divested their stakes in 2015 to Kudryavtsev, who held the right of first refusal. According to the newspaper, Vedmosti had about twenty-thousand paid subscribers in November 2016. Ilya Bulavinov, former head of the directorate for internet broadcasting of the state First Channel, has been serving as chief editor since 2017.

In March 2020, Kudryavtsev and his partners, Boris Berezovsky associate Vladimir Voronov and former News Corp executive Martin Pompadour, announced their intention to sell to two buyers: publisher of Nasha Versiya Konstantin Zyatkov and managing director of Arbat Capital Alexei Golubovich. Former editor-in-chief Tatiana Lysova criticized the sale, saying that the buyers were &quot;alien to &#x27;s rules and ideals.&quot;

The following month, the sale was put on hold amid accusations of censorship under editor-in-chief Andrey Shmarov. Shmarov reportedly deleted articles critical of Rosneft&#x27;s head, Igor Sechin, and banned articles critical of Putin&#x27;s proposed constitutional changes. According to an investigation by &quot;Meduza&quot;, Arkan Investment, s parent company, had taken out a loan of from Rosneft&#x27;s subsidiary the Russian Regional Development Bank (RRDB) to pay off a previous loan from the Russian state-owned bank Gazprombank which was used to buy in 2015. The investigation also alleged that Rosneft spokesperson Mikhail Leontyev was involved in both the selection of Shmarov as editor-in-chief and in negotiating the sale of the paper. Kudryavtsev confirmed the loan, but claims the loan was not used to buy .

On 29 May 2020, was sold to businessman Ivan Yeremin via his holding company Sapport.

On 15 June 2020, five senior editors resigned from in protest to Shmarov&#x27;s confirmation to editor-in-chief by the paper&#x27;s board of directors. Some of them established an independent &quot;&quot; news website. Russia designated &quot;VTimes&quot; as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; in May 2021, saying it was registered in the Netherlands; on 3 June 2021, &quot;VTimes&quot; announced closure of its operations on 12 June, citing operational difficulties connected with the status.

In 2022, the formal ownership of was transferred to Oleg Leonov, a PR advisor and former head of the FTI Consulting office in Moscow.

== Criticism ==
In July 2016 published an article about Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft. According to the article Sechin was building a house in Barvikha on a plot worth $60 million. In November of the same year, Sechin won the case against and the court ordered the newspaper to remove the material from the newspaper&#x27;s website and destroy all available circulation of this article.

==Biography==
Nakata studied at the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music. His first roles were for live-action works where his major characters portrayed included Sir Cowler in &quot;Choushinsei Flashman&quot; and Great Professor Bias in &quot;Choujuu Sentai Liveman&quot; of the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series. He was doing theater work as well as live-action drama and voice dubbing when Michiko Nomura, who had worked on &quot;Sazae-san&quot;, suggested him to become a voice actor. Nakata said in an interview with Sutoraiku that he compared the pay for the roles and was very astonished by the difference, so he then switched to full-time voice acting.

He narrated &quot;Mobile Suit Victory Gundam&quot; which aired in 1993. In 1994, he voiced Murakumo Yagami, the series&#x27; main antagonist in &quot;Blue Seed&quot;.

He would continue to voice major antagonists including Gaav in &quot;Slayers Next&quot;, Stargazer in &quot;Lost Universe&quot;, and &quot;Brian J. Mason&quot; in &quot;Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040&quot;.

In 2001, he voiced the antihero Alucard in the &quot;Hellsing&quot; TV series. Looking back at his career, Nakata said that Alucard was the one character he most enjoyed voicing and the easiest one to portray. He said that villain characters and ones with distinct personalities were easier than ones with not much personality as they can be shaped and changed up. He later reprised his role as Alucard in the &quot;Hellsing Ultimate&quot; OVAs.

The year 2004 saw Nakata in some breakout roles. He voiced the title character in &quot;&quot; which was popular among the late night adult audience, but he also joined &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; in voicing Corporal Giroro, which was popular with kids and adults as it aired during prime time. In 2005, he picked up voice roles as villains Megatron in &quot;Transformers Cybertron&quot; and Amshel Goldsmith in &quot;Blood+&quot;. He voiced Roy Revant, the protagonist of &quot;SoltyRei&quot;.; the director for &quot;SoltyRei&quot; would later cast him as the narrator in the &quot;Amagami SS&quot; visual novel anime adaptation.

He joined the &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; visual novel franchise, voicing Kirei Kotomine in the 2004 release, its anime adaptation in 2006, its feature film &quot;Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works&quot; in 2010, and the prequel series &quot;Fate/zero&quot;. In his interview, Nakata said that co-creator Kinoko Nasu had known him since his Tokusatsu days, and that he had been involved in many of Type-Moon&#x27;s titles, having voiced Nrvnqsr Chaos in &quot;Melty Blood&quot; and going on to voice Souren Araya in the anime adaptation of &quot;Kara no Kyoukai&quot;. In 2014, he reprised his role of Kirei for the &quot;Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works&quot; television series.

In 2013 he was the narrator for &quot;Noucome&quot;, voiced lead character Sigmund in &quot;Unbreakable Machine-Doll&quot;, and voiced Nyanta in &quot;Log Horizon&quot;.

In video games, he voiced in the &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; (Sengoku Musou) series as Uesugi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. In overseas dubbing, he has voiced various characters in shows and films such as &quot;300&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Nakata said that because of his live-action background, he felt comfortable with portraying the overseas dubbing roles, although he still enjoyed the creativity coming from the two-dimensional anime characters.

<text>Richard Arnold Roundtree (July 9, 1942 – October 24, 2023) was an American actor. He was best known for his portrayal of private detective John Shaft in the 1971 film &quot;Shaft&quot; and four of its sequels, &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot; (1972), &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot; (1973), its 2000 sequel and its 2019 sequel, as well as the eponymous television series (1973–1974). He was also known for featuring in several TV series, including &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;Generations&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

Considered as &quot;the first black action hero&quot;, Roundtree was credited with having an impact on the rise of African American leading actors in Hollywood projects, thanks to his successful performances in the genre. His portrayal of Shaft as a bold, confident, and charismatic figure also influenced cinematic depictions of black men and black masculinity, a contrast to black men in films prior to &quot;Shaft&quot; having often been portrayed as mild-mannered or servile.

==Early life and education==
Richard Arnold Roundtree was born on July 9, 1942, in New Rochelle, New York, to John Roundtree and Kathryn Watkins. Roundtree attended New Rochelle High School, where he graduated in 1961. He subsequently attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, but eventually dropped out of college in 1963, in order to begin his acting career.

==Career==
Roundtree started his professional career around 1963, as he began working as a model at the Ebony Fashion Fair after being scouted by Eunice W. Johnson; he then began modeling in advertisements for products such as Johnson Products&#x27; Duke hair grease and Salem cigarettes. In 1967, Roundtree joined the Negro Ensemble Company: he then went on to play his first theatrical role by portraying boxer Jack Johnson in the company&#x27;s production of &quot;The Great White Hope.&quot; According to J. E. Franklin, he acted in the Off-Off-Broadway production of her play &quot;Mau Mau Room,&quot; by the Negro Ensemble Company Workshop Festival,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYPL/Schomburg Center/Negro Ensemble Company&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at St. Mark&#x27;s Playhouse in 1969, directed by Shauneille Perry.
 Roundtree made his first big-screen appearance by playing a minor role in the film &quot;What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?&quot;, a 1970 American hidden-camera style reality film directed by &quot;Candid Camera&quot; creator Allen Funt.
In the following years, he became a leading man in early 1970s films, and gained widespread popularity through his portrayal of private detective John Shaft in the action movie &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971) and its sequels, &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot; (1972) and &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot; (1973); he also played the same role in the eponymous television series, aired by CBS between 1973 and 1974. In 1981, he appeared opposite Laurence Olivier and Ben Gazzara in the epic war film &quot;Inchon&quot;, directed by Terence Young. In 1984, he starred again as a private detective, Diehl Swift, in the buddy-crime comedy movie &quot;City Heat,&quot; acting alongside Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds. On television, he played the slave Sam Bennett in the 1977 television mini-series &quot;Roots&quot;, and then starred as Dr. Daniel Reubens in the soap opera &quot;Generations&quot; from 1989 to 1991. Although Roundtree worked throughout the entirety of the 1990s, many of his films from that era were not well-received publicly; however, he found success in several stage plays.

During that same period of time, Roundtree kept featuring in TV series: on September 19, 1991, he appeared in the episode &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, from the second season of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In 1995, he acted in David Fincher&#x27;s critically-acclaimed movie &quot;Seven&quot;; in 2000, he starred again as John Shaft in a new, eponymous sequel of the original 1971 film, with Samuel L. Jackson playing the title character. In 1997, he appeared in the comedy movie &quot;George of the Jungle;&quot; around the same year, he played a leading role as Phil Thomas in the Fox ensemble drama, &quot;413 Hope St&quot;; in 1999, he portrayed Booker T. Washington in the 1999 television movie &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters&#x27; First 100 Years&quot;. He served as a voice actor for the title character from the PlayStation game &quot;Akuji the Heartless&quot;, which was first released in 1999.

In 2004, Roundtree guest-starred in several episodes of the first season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as an amoral private detective; in 2005, he played the assistant vice principal of a high school in the neo-noir mystery film &quot;Brick&quot;. 
Starting from the same year, Roundtree appeared in the television series &quot;The Closer&quot; as retired colonel D. B. Walter; in 2006, he starred in the science fiction drama series &quot;Heroes&quot; as Charles Deveaux, the terminally ill father of main character Simone Deveaux (Tawny Cypress). He then appeared as Eddie Sutton&#x27;s father-in-law in several episodes of family drama series &quot;Lincoln Heights&quot;, before playing a supporting role in the 2008 film &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, a live-action adaptation of the eponymous Japanese manga. During the same year, he also appeared in the TV series &quot;Knight Rider&quot; as the father of FBI agent Carrie Ravai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier). Starting from 2013, he co-starred as the father of lead character Mary Jane Paul (Gabrielle Union) in the drama series &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;, aired on BET.

In 2019, Roundtree co-starred in the comedy film &quot;What Men Want&quot;, before once again returning to the role of John Shaft in &quot;Shaft&quot;, a new sequel to the 2000 film, opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Jessie T. Usher, who portrayed John Shaft II and John Shaft III, respectively. Starting from the same year, Roundtree also had a recurring role on &quot;Family Reunion.&quot;

Roundtree&#x27;s final film to be released in his lifetime was &quot;Moving On&quot; (2023) with Jane Fonda. The last film released was &quot;Thelma&quot; (2024).

==Personal life, health problems, and death==
Roundtree was married and divorced twice and had five children. He married Mary Jane Grant in 1963; the couple had two children before divorcing in 1973. He dated actress and TV personality Cathy Lee Crosby shortly thereafter. Roundtree later married Karen M. Ciernia in 1980; they had three children together before divorcing in 1998.

In 1993, Roundtree was diagnosed with breast cancer, and subsequently underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy.

Roundtree died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Los Angeles on October 24, 2023, at the age of 81.

<doc id="1147879" wikidata="Q3633682" url="?curid=1147879" title="Sledging (cricket)">
<text>In the sport of cricket, sledging is the practice of deliberately insulting or verbally intimidating an opposing player. The purpose is to try to weaken the opponent&#x27;s concentration, thereby causing them to underperform or be more prone to error. It can be effective because the batsman stands well within hearing range of the bowler and certain close fielders, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The insults may be direct or may feature in conversations among fielders which are intended to be overheard by the batsman. The term has also been used in other sports, as when the tennis player Nick Kyrgios insulted his opponent, Stan Wawrinka, by referring to a purported encounter between another player and the latter&#x27;s girlfriend.

There is debate in the cricketing world as to whether sledging constitutes deliberately poor sportsmanship or is simply good-humoured banter. Sledging is sometimes interpreted as abuse, and it is widely acknowledged some comments aimed as sledges do sometimes cross the line into personal abuse.

Sledging can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh referred to the practice as one of &quot;mental disintegration&quot;.

==Origin==

Australian newspapers acknowledged &quot;sledging&quot; as a term in the mid-1970s. Despite the relatively recent coining of the term, the practice is as old as cricket itself, with historical accounts of witty banter between players being quite common. W. G. Grace and his brother E. M. were noted throughout their careers for being &quot;noisy and boisterous&quot; on the field. W. G. admitted that they used to &quot;chaff&quot; (i.e., tease) opponents, and this is seen as part of the gamesmanship for which E. M. and W. G. were always controversial.

According to Ian Chappell, the use of &quot;sledging&quot; as a term originated at Adelaide Oval in either the 1963–1964 or 1964–1965 Sheffield Shield competition. Chappell claims that a cricketer who swore in the presence of a woman was said to have reacted to an incident &quot;like a sledgehammer&quot;. As a result, the direction of insults or obscenities at opponents became known as &quot;sledging&quot;.

According to the BBC&#x27;s Pat Murphy: &quot;My understanding is that it came from the mid-sixties and a guy called Grahame Corling, who used to open the bowling for New South Wales and Australia … apparently the suggestion was that this guy&#x27;s wife was [having an affair] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [the fielding team] started singing &quot;When a Man Loves A Woman&quot;, the old Percy Sledge number.&quot;

The 1974–75 Australians were labelled the &quot;Ugly Australians&quot; for their hard-nosed cricket, verbal abuse and hostile fast bowling. &quot;Behind the batsmen, Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity&quot;, and Tom Graveney wrote &quot;It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.&quot;

West Indian batsman Viv Richards was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him, so much so that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However, in a county game against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas attempted to sledge him after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He informed Richards: &quot;It&#x27;s red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering.&quot; Richards hammered the next delivery out of the cricket ground and into the nearby River Taff. Turning to the bowler, he commented: &quot;Greg, you know what it looks like, now go and find it.&quot;

==International views==

=== Australia ===
It has been pointed out (for example in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;) that the Australian cricket team believes in playing in a more &quot;robust&quot; fashion than others and that it upholds a &quot;sledging culture&quot;. As per Australian cricketer Mark Taylor, Australian fans want to watch &quot;combative cricket&quot;. Australian batsman Ricky Ponting has argued that sledging helps get players &quot;out of control&quot; and &quot;out of their comfort zone&quot;. Ponting has also said that it&#x27;s &quot;not as bad&quot; as the average person would think. Australian all-rounder Michael Clarke has said that he &quot;loved the aggressive approach&quot;. In response to &quot;personal sledging&quot; accusations against his team, Australian cricketer Steve Smith has said, &quot;Getting personal on the field is not on, that&#x27;s crossing the line in my opinion.&quot; By contrast, Australian opener Ed Cowan suggests that &quot;all sledging is personal&quot; adding that Australian cricketers should be &quot;nowhere near the line&quot;.
Before the controversial Test series during Australia&#x27;s Tour of South Africa in 2018 commenced, Australian spinner Nathan Lyon commented on sledging: &quot;We know where the line is. We headbutt it, but we don&#x27;t go over it.&quot; Following the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal, voices calling for a reformation of Australia&#x27;s &#x27;cricket culture&#x27; have emerged. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called for an end to sledging following the scandal. Following the outrage over the scandal, former Australian cricketer Justin Langer said that cricket would be &#x27;dull&#x27; without sledging. Australian batsman David Warner who received a one-year ban following the controversial series, exclaimed: &quot;I play with aggression on the field and I try not to cross that line&quot;. Former Australian cricketer and former coach of the Australian team Darren Lehmann has suggested that Australia is &#x27;not as bad&#x27; as portrayed, adding that sledging was worse during his own times. Australian wicketkeeper Tim Paine, in captaincy as replacement for Steve Smith who received a one-year ban from the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal, said that his team will &#x27;stay on the side of banter and never go to abuse.&#x27;

Australian cricketer Chris Lynn suggests that franchise cricket has helped reduce sledging as players tend to end up being in the same team. According to former Australian cricketer Mike Whitney, sledging is part of the game as long as it&#x27;s not &#x27;personal&#x27;. During India&#x27;s Tour of Australia in 2018-19, Australian cricketers were &#x27;scared&#x27; to sledge Indian Test captain Virat Kohli and &#x27;sucked up&#x27; to him for lucrative IPL contracts, according to Michael Clarke.

In August 2019, Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts announced that they will be updating the board&#x27;s anti-discrimination code to add penalties including life bans for on-field slurs related to sexuality as part of its policy for &#x27;inclusion of transgender and gender diverse players in elite cricket&#x27;. This was met with harsh criticism by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison who called the policy a &#x27;sledgehammer&#x27;.

=== Bangladesh ===
Historically described as a &#x27;timid&#x27; side, Bangladesh underwent a transformation as they grew in confidence following the 2015 Cricket World Cup, according to Bangladeshi cricketer Mashrafe Mortaza. Mortaza says that he encourages his players to &#x27;look the opponent in the eye&#x27; while &#x27;not overstepping a line&#x27;. He also insists that his side &#x27;does not start a conversation&#x27; on the field. Bangladesh former cricketer and commentator Athar Ali Khan says that Bangladesh has moved out of a &#x27;culture of backing off&#x27;.

=== England ===
England coach Trevor Bayliss expressed disapproval over sledging being caught on the stump mics, suggesting that sledging must be censored on television as it isn&#x27;t a &#x27;great thing for young kids at home watching&#x27;. In contrast with Bayliss, England cricketer Moeen Ali suggests stump mics should be turned up, in order to deter players from sledging.

Former English cricketer Bob Willis has suggested that sledging of a &#x27;personal nature&#x27; should be reported to the match referee, with particular reference to Australian sledging directed at English players during the 2017-18 Ashes. Before England&#x27;s Tour of New Zealand in 2018, former English cricketer Geoffrey Boycott called for English cricketers to &#x27;drop&#x27; sledging. England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow has expressed a need for greater clarity with regard to what is deemed as &#x27;personal&#x27;, pointing out that there are so many grey areas around the &#x27;line&#x27;.

=== India ===

Former Indian captain Kapil Dev laid the foundation to turn India into a competitive sledging side, according to Viv Richards. Saurav Ganguly is known to be among India&#x27;s first &#x27;aggressive&#x27; captains who employed sledging on the field. Indian batsman Virender Sehwag has said, &quot;If there&#x27;s no sledging, there won&#x27;t be any enjoyment left in the game.&quot; Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir said it&#x27;s fine to do &#x27;whatever you can to upset the opposition till the time you don&#x27;t get personal.&#x27; Indian wicketkeeper MS Dhoni has described sledging as an &#x27;art&#x27; and has said it is fair as long as a &#x27;line&#x27; isn&#x27;t crossed. Indian pacer Sreesanth has said that sledging is &#x27;part and parcel&#x27; of the game. Indian bowler Irfan Pathan has said that sledging has a &#x27;certain charm&#x27; about it also adding that it should be done &#x27;within limits&#x27;. Former Indian cricketer and commentator Sunil Gavaskar explains that sledging is done to &#x27;disrupt a cricketer&#x27;s concentration&#x27;. Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif has stated that sledging is fine but verbals must not extend to &#x27;family&#x27;.

Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli said, &quot;We take it very well and we give it back even better.&quot; Ganguly has stated that Kohli&#x27;s aggression is &#x27;two-times more&#x27; than his own. Under Kohli&#x27;s captaincy, players are required to have &#x27;top fitness, high intensity and an aggressive mindset&#x27;. Upon receiving the ICC Spirit of Cricket Award in January 2020, India captain Virat Kohli talked in support of sledging, on-field banter and intimidation adding that individuals should not be targeted &#x27;emotionally&#x27;. Sachin Tendulkar has pointed out that aggression has become the strength of the Indian team under Kohli. Indian Test cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara said that he makes &#x27;a lot of noise on the field&#x27; and believes that sledging &#x27;helps the bowlers&#x27;. Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane has compared sledging (on the cricket field) to &#x27;car honking while driving&#x27;. Defending sledging objections against Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant by Australian cricketers during India&#x27;s Tour of Australia in 2018, former Indian batsman VVS Laxman said, &quot;When you&#x27;re playing for your country you have to play with pride, you have to play with passion.&quot;

=== New Zealand ===
Former New Zealand cricketer Adam Parore admitted to cringing when reflecting upon sledging in his own times and exclaimed that he hadn&#x27;t heard the word &#x27;humble&#x27; before 2009. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said that sledging wasn&#x27;t &#x27;always pretty&#x27; but that he was ready to take any &#x27;advantage&#x27; for the team. New Zealand&#x27;s attitude under Fleming, particularly against South Africa, has reportedly been &#x27;nasty&#x27;. In a bid to reconnect with fans, Brendon McCullum transformed the New Zealand team into a much friendlier cricketing opposition upon taking captaincy, doing away with all sledging. McCullum said that sledging in an abusive manner was not &#x27;authentic to being a New Zealander&#x27;. Ex-New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori has said that &#x27;being nice suits Kiwi style&#x27;, also claiming that he was never sledged by the Australians.

Following the 2015 World Cup Final between New Zealand and Australia which saw Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin engage in &#x27;repeated sledging&#x27;, the former publicly repudiated sledging. New Zealand cricketer Grant Elliott, who was among those targeted by Australian cricketers during the 2015 World Cup Final, commented: &quot;You should sort cricket issues out with bat or ball, not with your mouth.&quot;

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been described as a &#x27;great example for kids&#x27; by Adam Parore. Williamson was awarded the ICC Spirit of Cricket Award in 2018 with the ICC describing his behavior as &#x27;outstanding&#x27;.

New Zealand women&#x27;s captain Sophie Devine stated that sledging in women&#x27;s cricket is not commonplace but it is &#x27;witty and funny&#x27; whenever it occurs.

=== Pakistan ===

Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan has mentioned that his players &#x27;learnt&#x27; aggression during Pakistan&#x27;s 1972-73 tour of Australia. Khan specifically mentioned Sarfaraz Nawaz among the players that &#x27;picked up sledging&#x27; from the Australians. In 1999, the Pakistan Cricket Board lodged an official complaint to its Australian counterpart over &#x27;persistent sledging&#x27; and the use of &#x27;highly abusive language&#x27; against Pakistani players. Before Pakistan&#x27;s Tour of Australia in 2004, then Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq made it clear that his players will &#x27;give what they get&#x27; if subjected to sledging. Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram has emphasised that what is said on the field should remain on the field.

=== South Africa ===
South African wicketkeeper-batsman Mark Boucher exclaimed that sledging &#x27;will never completely leave the game.&#x27;

=== Sri Lanka ===
The Sri Lankan Cricket Team has had a reputation of avoiding verbal aggression. Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga called for a ban on sledging in early 2008 with particular reference to Australia&#x27;s interactions with touring sides. Former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara drew a clear distinction between aggression &#x27;on the field&#x27; and verbal sledging, remarking that the two are different from each other.

=== West Indies ===
The West Indies Cricket Team was famous in having a fearsome pace bowling attack during the 1980s, but rarely indulged in verbal intimidation of the opposition unless provoked. West Indies great Viv Richards said that his reaction to sledging was &#x27;confrontational&#x27;. According to Richards, sledging is an &#x27;inevitable part&#x27; of modern-day cricket. He further expounds that &#x27;racial&#x27; slurring translates to crossing the line, comparing it to &#x27;being hit in the nuts&#x27; and asserting that it is entirely unacceptable. Former West Indies wicketkeeper Deryck Murray has said that there is no room for sledging based around someone&#x27;s &#x27;race&#x27; or &#x27;family background&#x27;, adding that sledging directed towards West Indies players, particularly by Australians, during his career was sometimes &#x27;beyond acceptable&#x27;. West Indies legend Curtly Ambrose has simply said: &quot;I despise players who sledge. Sledging is very childish and beneath contempt.&quot;

<text>In Australia, regional television is the local television services outside of the five main Australian cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth).

==History==
===1960s===
Australia&#x27;s first regional television station was launched three-and-a-half years after the rollout of television had commenced in metropolitan Sydney and Melbourne. First to launch was TVT-6 Hobart on 23 May 1960. GLV-10 in Traralgon opened on 9 December 1961 and was followed 14 days later by GMV-6 in Shepparton and BCV-8 Bendigo.

Television continued to expand in Victoria and across the country throughout the 1960s, with no fewer than twenty-five stations making their first transmissions between 1962 and 1968.

Many of the first stations produced their own local programming, supplemented by content from the capital city stations such as GTV-9 Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;. GLV-10 Traralgon was amongst the first to make use of live &#x27;off-air&#x27; relays of programmes from metropolitan stations without the use of video recording equipment.

===1970s===
VEW-8 Kalgoorlie opened on 18 June 1971 and ITQ-8 Mount Isa commenced on 11 September 1971 before television reached the Northern Territory on 11 November 1971 with the launch of NTD-8 Darwin. The last regional stations to launch were GSW-9 Albany (a relay of BTW-3 Bunbury) on 29 August 1974, RTS-5A Loxton on 26 November 1976 and GTW-11 Geraldton on 21 January 1977.

Similar to their metropolitan counterparts, various stations began to form programming and operational partnerships in order to reduce operating costs and share the cost of imported programming.

Television 6-8-9 (later Mid State Television)
* CWN-6 Dubbo
* CBN-8 Orange
* MTN-9 Griffith

Television Centre of Victoria (TCV) (later TV8, then Southern Cross TV8 and then Southern Cross Network)
* BCV-8/11 Bendigo/Swan Hill
* GLV-10 Gippsland
* STV-8 Mildura

RVN-AMV (later The Prime Network)
* RVN-2 Wagga Wagga
* AMV-4 Albury

Northern Rivers–Gold Coast Television (later Northern Rivers Television)
* NRN-11 Coffs Harbour
* RTN-8 Lismore
A partnership between NRN-11 Coffs Harbour and ECN-8 Taree was split up when NRN joined RTN-8 in 1971. ECN later went into partnership with NEN-9 Tamworth.

All television stations in Australia, including regional stations, were required to convert to colour transmission in 1975.

===1980s===
Stations continued to form various partnerships and networks throughout the 1980s.

North Queensland Television (later QTV)
* TNQ-7 Townsville
* FNQ-10 Cairns

SIX Network Victoria (later Television Victoria)
* GMV-6 Shepparton
* BTV-6 Ballarat
* STV-8 Mildura (joined network after purchase by Ent Limited)

TV8 (later Southern Cross TV8 and then Southern Cross Network)
* GLV-8 Gippsland
* BCV-8 Bendigo
* STV-8 Mildura (split from network after purchase by Ent Limited)

TasTV
* TVT-6 Hobart
* TNT-9 Launceston (split from network in 1989 to become Southern Cross)

Golden West Network (later GWN7, now Seven Regional WA)
* BTW-3 Bunbury
* GSW-9 Albany
* VEW-8 Kalgoorlie
* GTW-11 Geraldton


Throughout the 1980s, a number of regional stations were required to move to different frequencies. These included GLV-10 in Gippsland, who moved to channel 8 in order to allow ATV-0 Melbourne to move to channel 10 in 1980. DDQ-10 and TVQ-0 switched channels to become DDQ-0 and TVQ-10, and SEQ10 became SEQ55 in 1988.

The last regional station to launch before aggregation launched unofficially on 2 January 1988 – IMP-9, Imparja Television in Alice Springs, began transmission via the AUSSAT satellites, as well as a number of terrestrial transmitters.

====Aggregation====
The Hawke government of the 1980s introduced a system of regional equalisation, known as aggregation, which would provide regional viewers with the same viewing choice as their metropolitan counterparts.

Local stations protested at this proposal, arguing that their profits would fall, and that local output would also decrease. They offered their own proposal, whereby the existing operator would be allowed to operate relays of the other two networks, allowing a combination of both viewer choice and local programming. If NBN were to take the Nine affiliation, for example, their two relays would offer programs from the Seven and Ten networks, direct from Sydney. This proposal was, however, rejected.

The new system would allow stations to transmit into neighbouring markets, as an affiliate of one of the three metropolitan networks. For instance, before aggregation, there were three separate licence areas in northern New South Wales – Newcastle, New England, and the Mid North Coast, each served by a single commercial station. After aggregation, these three licence areas merged, with the three stations in direct competition for viewers.

Soon after realising they had lost their battle with the government, the stations began to organise affiliations with metro networks. Stations that hadn&#x27;t joined forces beforehand began to merge and form new networks:
Vision TV (later Star Television)
* RTQ-7 Rockhampton
* DDQ-0 Toowoomba

Prime Television (&quot;later Prime7, now Seven Regional&quot;)
* CWN-6 Dubbo (previously part of &quot;Mid State Television&quot;)
* CBN-8 Orange (previously part of &quot;Mid State Television&quot;)
* MTN-9 Griffith (previously part of &quot;Mid State Television&quot;, split from network in 1989 to affiliate with WIN Television)
* RVN-2 Wagga Wagga (previously part of &quot;RVN-AMV&quot;)
* AMV-4 Albury-Wodonga (previously part of &quot;RVN-AMV&quot;)

Sunshine Television Network (callsign STQ)
* SEQ-8 Maryborough
* MVQ-6 Mackay
Southern New South Wales was the first area to be formed, in two phases (as a result of problems in Orange and Wagga), starting on 31 March 1989. WIN Television Wollongong (WIN-4) became an affiliate of the Nine Network, The Prime Network became a Seven affiliate, and Capital Television in Canberra became a Network Ten affiliate.

The next area to be aggregated was Queensland, which took place on 31 December 1990. QTV was to become a Nine affiliate, Star Television a Network Ten affiliate, and the Sunshine Television Network a Seven affiliate. However, in the week before aggregation was due to take place, WIN Television bought Star Television and gave them the Nine affiliation – meaning that QTV was forced to change its affiliation to Network Ten.

The next year, northern New South Wales was aggregated. NBN became the Nine Network affiliate, while the Seven Network would be carried by Prime Television, formerly carried by 9-8 Television. Northern Rivers Television (NRTV) became the Network Ten affiliate. At one stage, WIN made its first attempt in setting up a northern New South Wales outlet by replicating the steal it had made in Regional Queensland. WIN tried to buy NRTV through bidding to steal the Nine affiliation rights from NBN, and force the latter to pick up the Ten affiliation. However, nothing came out of the deal and the respective affiliations remained as is among stations until today.

Aggregation in Victoria took place between 1992 and 1993. VIC TV became a Nine Network affiliate, Prime Television took affiliation with Seven, and SCN took affiliation with Ten. Tasmania was aggregated in 1994, albeit with only two stations – Southern Cross is a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, while Tas TV took programming from the Nine Network.

Remote and Central Australia was the final area to be aggregated – one of the largest geographical licence areas, taking in parts of the Northern Territory, western Queensland, the north west of South Australia, and other areas in which terrestrial television signals cannot be received. Stations broadcast to this area mainly through satellite or re-transmission stations. Imparja Television, based in Alice Springs, became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate, while Seven Central, based in Mount Isa, became a Seven affiliate.

A number of areas were not aggregated, due to their small size and relative inability to support more than one commercial station – these included Griffith, Mildura, Darwin and regional Western Australia.

===1990s===
Throughout the 1990s, a number of changes relating to local programming and identity began to take place – the first of which was to occur for NRTV, bought out by QTV&#x27;s owners, Telecasters Australia in 1993. Soon after, both stations took on generic Network Ten branding with the name &quot;Ten Northern New South Wales&quot; and &quot;Ten Queensland&quot;. Local news services were also axed in most of these areas with the exception of Townsville and Cairns. Similarly, the Southern Cross Network in Victoria changed its name and logo to a pseudo-Ten &quot;SCN&quot; design. The same network later axed local news services and changed its name to &quot;Ten Victoria&quot;, in line with moves taken by the Telecasters Australia-owned stations in New South Wales and Queensland.

NBN made similar moves in 1994, when it launched a new logo based on that of the Nine Network at the time. Sunshine Television was purchased by the Seven Network in 1995 and became nearly identical to the network&#x27;s metropolitan stations under the name &quot;Seven Queensland&quot;.

WIN Corporation, meanwhile, bought VIC TV from ENT Ltd. in October 1994, and folded the station to the larger WIN Television network, maintaining the affiliation with Nine.

A second commercial licence was made available for single-licence areas such as Mildura, Griffith, and Darwin. Incumbent stations were permitted to apply for the new licence under Section 73 of the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act 1992&quot;, however only if the Australian Broadcasting Authority, at the time, felt that there was no other operator who would be interested or able to operate a new station in the area. The ABA initially denied all three stations the ability to operate the new licences.

A joint complaint to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the ABA and Imparja Television in 1996 found in favour of MTN-9 but against the other incumbent stations. In both the Darwin and Mildura cases, it was determined that Imparja satisfied the ABA&#x27;s criteria of being in a position to run a second service in the area. Prime Television&#x27;s applications in both Griffith and Mildura, for the purposes of the appeal, were rejected on the grounds of insufficient local coverage.

When the auction process ended in late 1996, however, Prime was awarded the Mildura licence for $3.2 million, and commenced broadcasting with the callsign PTV-32 in 1997. Telecasters Australia launched Seven Darwin using TND-34 in the same year, following a $2.1 million bid for the licence.

In the same year, an amendment was made to the Broadcasting Services Act affirming the ability of existing broadcasters in one and two commercial station markets to apply for &quot;supplementary licences&quot;. These new licences allowed either a single incumbent or group of incumbents working together to run an additional channel.

In the then-single station markets, applying existing broadcasters gained both analog and digital licences for a new channel. In two station markets, the two existing broadcasters were allowed to form joint ventures to later bid for digital-only licences following the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia in 2001. The new licences were known as section 38A and 38B licences, respectively, after the relevant sections in the Broadcasting Services Act. Remote Central and Eastern Australia remains the only licence area without one of these stations either proposed or currently available.

The name &quot;Section 38A&quot; refers to the applicable section of the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act 1992&quot; which grants such rights to solus operators.

Using its Section 38A licence, MTN-9 was able to begin their supplementary service in 1997 using the callsign AMN-31. The new station carried almost all of sister Prime Television station CBN-8&#x27;s Prime programming with the exception of local news and major sporting events broadcast by Network 10. This was allocated on 18 July 1996, and went to air in 1997, after being initially rejected by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It is a feed of the Central West NSW station of Prime Television, and is licensed as &quot;AMN&quot;, broadcasting on UHF 31. A second licence for remote Western Australia, one of the last remaining solus markets, was put up for auction in 1998. WIN Television won the ability to broadcast to the entire regional Western Australia market (as opposed to GWN, which held separate licences in various areas), and subsequently launched its new station WOW in 1999. In the same year, WIN purchased Griffith affiliate MTN-9, as well as SES-8 Mount Gambier and RTS-5A Riverland.

===2000s===
In 2000, Southern Cross Broadcasting bought out both Telecasters Australia and Central GTS/BKN, subsequently removing any remaining local references, and rebranding its new stations with the &#x27;Southern Cross&#x27; name. Supplementary licences were also issued to SCB and WIN in parts of regional South Australia and Broken Hill, while at the same time, local programming was cut. The remote Eastern and remote Central licence areas were also merged at this time, amongst the last to be aggregated.

The solus operators in the regional licence areas of South Australia have been granted an 38A licence, being allocated on 24 April 2002.

* Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill: Central GTS/BKN, owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting was granted callsigns &quot;SGS&quot; and &quot;SCN&quot;, and branded as Southern Cross Ten, carrying Network Ten programming.
* Renmark/Loxton and Mount Gambier: WIN Television South Australia, owners of existing stations SES-8 and RTS-5A, was granted callsigns &quot;LRS&quot; and &quot;MGS&quot;, branded as &quot;WIN Ten&quot;, carrying Ten Network programming.

In more recent years, the premise has been extended to allow for two station markets where there are two different owners to apply, either separately or jointly, to operate a digital-only third station. These are known as &quot;Section 38B&quot; licences, and were created by the &quot;Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000&quot;.

Section 38B allows current operators to apply for the additional licence either as a joint venture company, or separately; in the case where both operators apply separately to ACMA, the licence is to be allocated via auction. However, as of 2007 all of the licences so far granted under section 38B have been to joint ventures between existing operators. These licences were awarded to Tasmania (Tasmanian Digital Television, owned by WIN and Southern Cross), Mildura (Mildura Digital Television, owned by WIN and Prime), and Darwin (Darwin Digital Television, owned by PBL Media and Southern Cross).

The axing of local news services by Prime7 and Southern Cross Broadcasting in Newcastle, Wollongong, Queensland, Darwin and remote Central &amp; Eastern Australia triggered a review of local content regulations by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABA later ruled, in 2003, that a minimum level of local content should be provided in the four largest regional licence areas. Prime and Southern Cross responded to this by launching two-minute bulletins for all affected regions from areas in which local news was already produced, as well as in Southern Cross Ten&#x27;s case the current affairs program &quot;State Focus&quot;, and on Prime, a Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;Saturday Club&quot;.

In December 2003, the first digital-only commercial television station was launched, Tasmanian Digital Television, operating on a supplementary licence owned jointly by WIN Television and Southern Cross. Similarly, Mildura Digital Television began broadcasting in 2006 to Mildura, offering exclusive Ten-based programming for the first time in the area. It is a direct feed of Ten Melbourne with local advertising. Darwin Digital Television opened transmission on 28 April 2008.

During April 2007, SP Telemedia announced that it would consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN (in its second attempt of entering the northern NSW market) and Nine Network&#x27;s owner PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media&#x27;s $250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL continued to operate it as a regional independent station until it was folded into the Nine Network on 1 July 2016 as a result of the regional affiliation switch between WIN Corporation and Southern Cross Austereo. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine&#x27;s content to the station&#x27;s entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches.

===2010s===
After Nine launched its new online catch-up video on demand and live streaming service 9Now on 27 January 2016, WIN filed a lawsuit against Nine, claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement. Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case on 28 April 2016, citing that &quot;live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the PSA (program supply agreement), and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it.&quot;

Following WIN&#x27;s defeat in the 9Now lawsuit, Nine announced it had signed a new $500 million affiliation deal with Network Ten affiliate Southern Cross Austereo, switching its primary Nine affiliation to stations currently affiliated with Ten in Southern NSW, ACT, and regional areas in Victoria and Queensland on 1 July 2016. As an affiliation fee to Nine, SCA would pay 50 percent of its revenue to the network. With that announcement, WIN was effectively stripped of its 27-year partnership with Nine. In response, WIN entered affiliation talks with Network Ten, reaching a final agreement on 23 May 2016. Under the new agreement, beginning 1 July 2016, WIN would carry Ten programming into regional Queensland, Southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Deals to supply Nine programming to South Australia, and Griffith were secured on 29 June 2016, a day later Tasmania were secured as well. A supply deal for Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television was not secured before the 1 July 2016 deadline, but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016 with programming resuming that night.

In late January 2017, it was announced that Southern Cross had entered into negotiations with WIN Corporation, owners of regional Ten-affiliate WIN Television, over the sale of NRN in exchange for WIN&#x27;s Wollongong radio station i98FM. This deal would have expanded WIN&#x27;s television coverage across all regional markets in the eastern states and granted Southern Cross radio coverage in Wollongong. Southern Cross later withdrew from negotiations on 20 February 2017 with no explanation given. However, WIN and Southern Cross later finalised an agreement where they would sell NRN to WIN for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. WIN, which had its third attempt for a NNSW outlet successful since 1991, maintained the station as &quot;Ten Northern NSW&quot; until playout and transmission were transferred to Mediahub on 1 September 2017, at which point the station adopted the WIN branding. Channel numbers were reshuffled to align with WIN&#x27;s other stations; but as Nine owned NBN Television holds the 8 numbered digital channels, NRN&#x27;s channels remained on the 5 numbered channels.

===2020s–present===
On 12 March 2021, Nine announced that it would return to WIN Television as its regional affiliate in most markets beginning 1 July 2021, in a deal that would last at least seven years. This would include WIN paying half of its regional advertising revenue to Nine Entertainment Co., and providing advertising time for Nine&#x27;s properties on WIN&#x27;s radio and television outlets. WIN would also provide advertising sales services for Nine&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations NBN and NTD (with the former succeeding a similar agreement it had with SCA). Nine CEO Hugh Marks explained that &quot;while our relationship with Southern Cross has been strong over the last five years, the opportunities presented by the WIN Network to both extend the reach of Nine&#x27;s premium content into more regional markets under one agreement, and to work cooperatively with them on a national and local news operation, mean this is the right time for us to return to WIN.&quot; As a result, SCA was forced to switch its television affiliation back to Network 10 after 5 years.

Alongside the affiliation switch on 1 July 2021, WIN as a sole network brand was retired after 32 years with its stations carrying Nine metro branding with WIN branding used for local idents, sponsor billboards and community noticeboards respectively. However WIN News is retained under its current name and format. With WIN and SCA using network branding from Nine and Network 10 respectively, it left Prime7 as the only regional network not fully using its metro affiliate branding – a distinction maintained until June 2022. 

According to the channel changes, Nine&#x27;s channel listing was reshuffled with 9Gem on channel 81, 9Go! on channel 82 and 9Life on channel 83, while Ten’s listing was reshuffled with 10 Peach on channel 52, 10 Bold on channel 53, 10 Shake on channel 54, SBN on channel 55 and Sky News Regional on channel 56.

On 1 November 2021, Seven West Media announced that it would acquire all the shares and subsidiaries of Prime Media. Prior to this, Seven&#x27;s previous attempt in 2019 was blocked by shareholders Antony Catalano, co-owner of Australian Community Media, and Bruce Gordon, owner of competitor WIN Corporation. Both felt that Seven&#x27;s offer of $60 million for the company was too low. Seven announced at the time that local news production would continue. The majority of Prime&#x27;s shareholders voted in favour of the deal on 23 December, and the takeover was completed on 31 December.

In 2022, Prime7 and GWN7 as sole network brands were retired after 11 years as reflection to Seven Network&#x27;s takeover. The transition to Seven&#x27;s branding was done in stages: its regional network was rebranded as Seven by June; local idents, sponsor billboards and community noticeboards adopted the Seven network branding around July; while its regional news division carried the Seven News brand on 25 July, but retaining its current operations pre-acquisition.

===Three station markets===
The majority of these licence areas are on the more densely populated east coast, in which three commercial stations are each affiliated to the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten from their respective capital cities. In addition to these, digital television channels from ABC Television and SBS Television are also available. The majority of these areas were aggregated in the early 1990s. The following are current affiliates as of April 2023.

==Programming==
Each commercial network (both regional and metropolitan) can be seen as being composed of three layers, with some exceptions. The first is the &quot;national feed&quot; – content that is broadcast to the entire country, more-or-less at the same time (accounting for time zones and minor rescheduling). This category is composed of nearly all the non-news programs and sometimes station promotions and branding.

The second is the &quot;state feed&quot;, content that is broadcast to the entire state or territory. It comprises mainly state news, as well as current affairs programs and station promotions. This is usually the case in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The third is the &quot;local feed&quot;, content broadcast to a specific market, such as local news and advertising.

===Original programming===
In order to fulfil regulations put in place by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority, the majority of regional networks are required to provide original, locally targeted output such as news, current affairs, or children&#x27;s programmes.

WIN Television, Australia&#x27;s largest regional network, used to produce a number of programs including sports magazine show &quot;Fishing Australia&quot;, cooking show &quot;Alive and Cooking&quot;, and travel shows &quot;Destinations&quot; and &quot;Postcards Australia&quot;. Southern Cross Television (now Seven) in Tasmania previously aired &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot; alongside a range of other regional programs.

Up until its co-branding with Channel Seven, both Prime and GWN produced their own versions of &quot;The Saturday Club&quot;. Prime also produced country music show &quot;A Little Bit of Country&quot; as well as an agricultural news program, &quot;On the Land&quot;. After those shows no longer aired, Prime7 and GWN7 showed just &quot;Seven Network&quot; programming before it was merged with the Seven Network.

Imparja Television also produce various local indigenous programs, as well as &quot;Yamba&#x27;s Playtime&quot;, a daily show for pre-school children. Most Imparja-produced programming is also shown on National Indigenous Television.

===News===
ACMA regulations have, since 2003, required stations to provide minimum levels of local news and other content.

* WIN Television produces three half-hour statewide and three local &quot;WIN News&quot; bulletins for regional markets, airing at 5:30pm on weeknights. Until 2021, the network also produced &quot;WIN’s All Australian News,&quot; composed of stories from WIN&#x27;s regional bulletins. In four markets, short news updates are broadcast throughout the day, generally to fulfill local content quotas.
* Nine-owned NBN produces an hour-long news service, &quot;NBN News&quot;, containing local, national and international news, sport and weather for its entire coverage area, airing nightly at 6:00pm. NBN News is considered as the only mainland regional station to produce a one-hour news bulletin 365 days a year. As part of the nightly bulletin, the station produces local opt-outs for each of its six sub-regions.
* Seven Regional (formerly branded as Prime7, Prime Television, GWN7 and the Golden West Network) produces half-hour bulletins in five markets in New South Wales and Victoria; as well as in Western Australia under the &quot;Seven News&quot; banner (former names include Prime Local News, Prime News and Prime7 News for regional NSW and regional Victoria; and Golden West News/GWN News and GWN7 News for regional WA). In other areas, Seven produces short updates to fulfill quota requirements.
* Seven Queensland produces half-hour bulletins in each of its seven coverage areas (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Central Queensland, Darling Downs, Wide Bay–Burnett and the Sunshine Coast).
* The Brisbane stations of Nine and Seven both produce half-hour bulletins for the Gold Coast at 5:30pm, airing as an opt-out on the respective station&#x27;s Gold Coast transmitters.
* Seven (SCA) in Tasmania produces &quot;Nightly News&quot;, a nightly hour-long bulletin incorporating local, national &amp; international news. SCA also used to produce a 30-minute local bulletin on weeknights for the Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill area of South Australia, until it was axed in 2023.
* For the remote central and eastern Australia licence area, Seven Central and Imparja Television both air short news updates each weekday.
* 10 (SCA) airs short local news updates in Queensland, Southern New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Darwin each weekday during the networks daytime and prime time programming across SCA&#x27;s fourteen markets.

In most cases, newsroom staff including reporters, camera crews and producers are based in newsrooms within the coverage area though the news program itself may be presented and broadcast from studios outside the region. For example, news staff for Seven&#x27;s Mackay bulletin is based in the city with the program presented from studios in Maroochydore.

===Scheduling===
The majority of programming in regional areas is shown at the same time as its metropolitan counterpart, with some exceptions, mainly for local news programs. Prior to the 2016 media shakeup, &quot;A Current Affair&quot; was shown at 7.30pm rather than 7.00pm in most WIN regions via then-HD multichannel 9Gem (GEM prior to 2015) (Tasmania and markets without a &quot;WIN News&quot; bulletin received the programme in its original timeslot on the main channel). NBN had aired the program on delay at 7pm until the expansion of Nine&#x27;s metropolitan local bulletins in January 2014, allowing the station to air ACA at the same time as in Sydney.

Seven Regional (then known as Prime7) had aired Seven News on delay at 6.30pm in markets that receive full local bulletins at 6.00pm until the major expansion of Seven&#x27;s metropolitan local bulletins in February 2014, allowing the stations to extend both the regional bulletins at the same time as in Sydney and Melbourne. In its current format, full bulletin markets served by stations CBN and NEN receive a combined newshour composed of the usual local news bulletin at 6:00pm, followed by a live statewide bulletin named &quot;Seven News at 6.30&quot;, covering national stories shown on Seven News in metropolitan markets; AMV transmitters in the Albury and NSW/Victoria border areas receive a delayed shortened first segment of Seven News Melbourne at 6.30pm after the local news, then switches back to the live Melbourne feed for sport and weather.

In the last ten years of the original 27 year affiliation agreement with Nine, WIN Television launched a range of original programs such as fishing program &quot;Fishing Australia&quot;, cooking program &quot;Alive and Cooking&quot; local daytime news program &quot;Daily&quot; and local daytime talk show &quot;Susie&quot;. &quot;Susie&quot; was launched during 2007 as a replace at the time for Nine&#x27;s &quot;Mornings With Kerri Anne&quot; due to affiliation disputes with Nine. It was hosted by former &quot;GMA&quot; regular Susie Elelman, the show covered a range of topical issues including health, parenting, cooking, fitness, fashion, gardening, beauty and relationships. Like &quot;Mornings&quot;, the show also included advertorials. Due to four different timeslot changes and disputes within network management, &quot;Susie&quot; was cancelled by WIN Television in late 2009. &quot;Alive and Cooking&quot; was launched as a replacement for &quot;Fresh with the Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; a joint venture with the &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and Nine Network. It was hosted by U.K. Celebrity Chef James Reeson. In the show, Reeson would demonstrate easy to prepare dishes in the studio and sometimes on location. The show produced 11 seasons. &quot;Daily&quot; was presented by Susie Elelman and Bianca Dye. The show covered news, views, topical issues and entertainment. It lasted one season.

Prior to the development of digital television broadcasting, many dual-network affiliates, such as WIN SA broadcast a mix of programming from three networks at differing times of the week, WIN WA and Imparja, broadcast a mix of programming from two networks at differing times of the week. Prior to the co-branding with Seven, Prime and GWN choose to replace nearly all Seven Network programs between midnight and 6am with infomercials, along with 10 Regional (the former Southern Cross Ten), which also replaced some morning programs and until late 2009 &quot;Judge Judy&quot; with infomercials.

Prior to 2016, NBN opted to air classic programs (The Sullivans), its own &quot;Today Extra&quot; program until 2007 and infomercials in place of Nine&#x27;s Morning News.

, local news, special events coverage and paid programming (infomercials) are the only occurrences of regional TV programming in Australia.

<text>Lesley Ann Warren (born August 16, 1946) is an American actress, singer and dancer. 

She made her Broadway debut in &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; in 1963. In 1965 she received wide recognition for playing the title role in the television musical production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. She then had starring roles in the Disney musical films &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (1967) and &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; (1968).

In the 1970s, Warren worked mostly on television, receiving a Golden Globe nomination for playing Dana Lambert in the CBS drama series &quot;&quot; (1970–71). In 1978, she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series for the NBC miniseries &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; 79 Park Avenue&quot;. In 1983, Warren was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Norma Cassidy in &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;. She received two additional Golden Globe nominations for performances in &quot;Songwriter&quot; (1984) and &quot;Family of Spies&quot; (1990). 

Her other film appearances include &quot;Race for the Yankee Zephyr&quot; (1981), &quot;A Night in Heaven&quot; (1983), &quot;Choose Me&quot; (1984), &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), &quot;Burglar&quot; (1987), &quot;Cop&quot; (1988), &quot;Life Stinks&quot; (1991), &quot;Pure Country&quot; (1992), &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994), &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999), and &quot;Secretary&quot; (2002).

==Early life==
Warren was born on August 16, 1946, in Manhattan, the daughter of real estate agent William C. Warren (née Woronoff), and the former Carol Margot Dorothea Verblow, a nightclub singer who migrated to the US from Eastbourne, England. She has a younger brother, Richard Lewis Warren. Her family is Jewish, with roots in Russia on both sides.

She attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School at the age of six and The High School of Music &amp; Art at the age of 13.

==Career==
===1960s and 1970s===

Warren began training as a ballet dancer at the age of 14, entering the School of American Ballet in 1961. The following year she made a tape of herself singing the Queen of the Night aria from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (the first and only time she sang opera). She entered the Actors Studio at the age of 17 — reputedly the youngest applicant ever to be accepted. Her Broadway debut came in 1963 in the musical &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;. She won the Theatre World Award for her performance in the 1965 flop musical &quot;Drat! The Cat!&quot; 

Warren achieved her first major television success in the title role of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1965. Her television appearances through the decade included &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. 

Her film debut in the 1967 musical comedy &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; was the last movie Walt Disney produced before his death. Warren would again share the screen with John Davidson the following year in the musical film &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot;. She placed No. 15 on the Laurel Awards list for Female New Face in 1968. 
Notable in television roles throughout the 1970s, Warren was leading lady Dana Lambert during the 1970–71 season of the CBS action drama &quot;&quot;. Her performance earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Additional TV movies and miniseries of this time include &quot;The Daughters of Joshua Cabe&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Letters&quot; (1973). 

Warren appeared in two feature films during the decade, &quot;Pickup on 101&quot; (1972) and &quot;Harry and Walter Go to New York&quot; (1976). In between films, she returned to the stage to portray Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in the 1973 Los Angeles production of the musical &quot;Scarlett&quot;, though poor reviews prevented the intended Broadway run.

Warren played a fatefully and fatally gullible psychiatric patient opposite Peter Falk and George Hamilton in the 1975 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;A Deadly State of Mind&quot;. Warren also played Lois Lane in the 1975 TV special &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird... It&#x27;s a Plane... It&#x27;s Superman&quot;, adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name. (Warren would screen test for the role of Lois Lane in the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film, ultimately cast with Margot Kidder.)

Additional television credits include &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot; (1975), &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1978), and &quot;Pearl&quot; (1978). She received critical acclaim, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 1978, for the NBC miniseries &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; 79 Park Avenue&quot;. Warren delved into the antics of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; as the guest star of a third season episode in 1979.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1981, Warren returned to the big screen starring alongside Ken Wahl, George Peppard, and Donald Pleasence in &quot;Race for the Yankee Zephyr&quot;, a New Zealand suspense-action-thriller film directed by David Hemmings. The following year, she played ditzy gun moll Norma Cassidy in Blake Edwards&#x27; musical comedy &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She went to star in the 1983 romantic drama &quot;A Night in Heaven&quot; with Christopher Atkins; critics widely panned the film. Warren received another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for starring opposite Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson in the 1984 musical comedy film &quot;Songwriter&quot;. That same year, she had a leading role in the love triangle drama &quot;Choose Me&quot; with Keith Carradine and Genevieve Bujold. She turned down a chance to audition for the Kathleen Turner role in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. In 1985, she starred as one of the prime murder suspects, Miss Scarlet, in the comedy film version of the popular board game &quot;Clue&quot;.

Warren played supporting roles in a number of movies, including &quot;Burglar&quot; (1987) with Whoopi Goldberg, &quot;Cop&quot; (1988) with James Woods, &quot;Worth Winning&quot; (1989) with Mark Harmon, &quot;Life Stinks&quot; (1991) with Mel Brooks and &quot;Pure Country&quot; (1992) with George Strait. In &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994) Warren played a nymphomaniac; the film was poorly received, and she was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. However, it was successful on the home video market. On television, she went to star in &quot;Beulah Land&quot; (1980), &quot;Portrait of a Showgirl&quot; (1982), &quot;Evergreen&quot; (1985) and &quot;Baja Oklahoma&quot; (1988). She received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film nominations for &quot;Family of Spies&quot; in 1990. Warren also played Princess Jeanetta in the 1987 &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; episode &quot;The Dancing Princesses&quot;, an adaptation of the fairy tale &quot;The Twelve Dancing Princesses&quot;. In 1986, Warren was prominently featured in Bob Seger&#x27;s popular music video for his hit song &quot;American Storm&quot;. In 1989, she appeared in the Aerosmith video &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, wherein she played Janie&#x27;s mother. She was also featured in a video for the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;. In 1995, she co-starred opposite Ben Kingsley in the television film &quot;Joseph&quot;. She had a major role in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999), starring Terence Stamp.

===2000s and 2010s===
In the 2000s, Warren appeared in a number of independent films, most notably the 2002 comedy-drama &quot;Secretary&quot;, playing the mother of the title character.

She had recurring roles on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; from 2001 to 2006 as Will Truman&#x27;s father&#x27;s mistress and in 2005 in the ABC comedy-drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Susan Mayer&#x27;s mother. Other television credits included &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; and &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;. From 2008 to 2012, Warren played the role of Jinx Shannon, the lead character&#x27;s alcoholic mother in the USA Network drama series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;. While working on that show, Warren was offered Mary Steenburgen&#x27;s role in &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008) but had to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts.

Warren appeared in the films &quot;Peep World&quot; (2010), &quot;Jobs&quot; (2013), &quot;I Am Michael&quot; (2015) and &quot;3 Days with Dad&quot; (2019). In 2013, she reunited with &quot;Clue&quot; castmates Christopher Lloyd and Martin Mull when they guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Psych&quot;, and again with Martin Mull in 2015 guest-starring on &quot;Community.&quot; In 2016, she had a recurring role in the Starz comedy &quot;Blunt Talk&quot; and in 2018 appeared in the Netflix superhero series &quot;Daredevil&quot; as Esther Falb. In 2019, she co-starred in the short-lived Lifetime comedy-drama series &quot;American Princess&quot;, and appeared opposite Sarah Drew in the Lifetime Christmas movie &quot;Twinkle All the Way&quot;.

===2020s===
In 2021, Warren guest-starred in an episode of the legal series &quot;All Rise&quot; on CBS. In 2022, she appeared as a regular cast member of the crime dramedy streaming series &quot;Panhandle&quot;, and had a featured role in the independent film &quot;It Snows All the Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Warren married producer Jon Peters in 1967 and divorced him in 1975 after a two-year separation. They have one son, Christopher Peters.

From 1977 to 1985, she lived with choreographer Jeffrey Hornaday. She also briefly dated producer Robert Evans, saxophonist David Sanborn, singers Bobby Darin and Paul Stanley, and actors Scott Baio, Robert Blake, Val Kilmer, and John Strasberg.

<text>Operation Peninsula Strike was a series of raids conducted by American troops from 9 to 13 June 2003 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, carried out by members of Task Force Ironhorse on a peninsula alongside the Tigris River near Balad, Iraq. In the operation US forces sought to target members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, paramilitary, and subversive units. Specifically, US Forces were to hit five objectives simultaneously, detain the targets and screen them for intelligence.

==The operation==
Attacking from helicopters, small boats and in armored vehicles, American forces set up road blocks and began a large raid with a force of over 1,000 soldiers, who quickly captured 397 suspects. Among those who were targeted for capture were two persons on the &#x27;Most Wanted List&#x27;: Major General Abul Ali Jasmin, the former Minister of Defense, and Brigadier General Abdullah Ali Jasmin, former head of the military academy. However, none of the targets were at the locations attacked. Of the 397 initially detained, most were released within days of the operation.

On the last day of the operation, a force of Iraqi insurgents attacked a patrol from the 4th Infantry Division, which was involved in the operation. The insurgents fired rocket-propelled grenades at the 4th Infantry Division tank patrol. The tanks returned fire, killing four attackers and forcing the others to flee. Later, backed by Apache helicopters, the U.S. forces pursued the remaining attackers, killing another 23.

Numerous weapons caches were seized.

==Units involved==
Included elements of the:
*3d Brigade, U.S. 4th Infantry Division
*173d Airborne Brigade
*3d Squadron, U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division
*1st Battalion, U.S. 8th Infantry Regiment
*720th Military Police Battalion
*57th Aviation Battalion
*159th Aviation Battalion
*2d Battalion, 503d Infantry Regiment
*elements from 104th Military Intelligence Battalion, U.S. 4th Infantry Division
*elements from 519th Military Intelligence Battalion

<text>The NFL draft, officially known as the &quot;NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting&quot;, is an annual event which serves as the league&#x27;s most common source of player recruitment. The draft order is determined based on the previous season&#x27;s standings; the teams with the worst win–loss records receive the earliest picks. Teams that qualified for the NFL playoffs select after non-qualifiers, and their order depends on how far they advanced, using their regular season record as a tie-breaker. The final two selections in the first round are reserved for the Super Bowl runner-up and champion. Draft picks are tradable and players or other picks can be acquired with them.

In 1936, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted on it in 1935. The intention of the draft is to make the NFL more competitive, as some teams had an advantage in signing players. From through the NFL designated the first overall selection as a &quot;bonus&quot; or &quot;lottery pick&quot;. The pick was awarded by a random draw and the winner who received the &quot;bonus pick&quot; forfeited its selection in the final round of the draft and became ineligible for future draws. The system was abolished prior to the 1959 NFL draft, as all twelve teams in the league at the time had received a bonus choice.

<doc id="1147901" wikidata="Q5570508" url="?curid=1147901" title="Global National">
<text>Global National is the English language flagship national newscast of Canada&#x27;s Global Television Network. Editorial and production staff are based out of Global&#x27;s national news centre at Global BC in Burnaby, British Columbia, with Dawna Friesen presenting from the Global BC studios Mondays to Thursdays, and Farah Nasser presenting from the Global Toronto studios Fridays to Sundays. From 2008 to 2010, the program was the only Canadian network newscast to be regularly anchored from the nation&#x27;s capital, Ottawa.

In addition to Global&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;Os), &quot;Global National&quot; also airs on affiliate CHFD-DT in Thunder Bay, Ontario and independent station CJON-DT in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

Global also produced a Mandarin version of the newscast, titled &quot;Global National Mandarin&quot; from 2012 to 2016. It was anchored by Carol Wang. The newscast was seen on Shaw Multicultural Channel in Vancouver, British Columbia &amp; Calgary, Alberta.

==History==
Global&#x27;s first tentative steps towards a national news presence came in 1994 with the launch of &quot;First National&quot;, a regional newscast presented by Peter Kent which was aired in Manitoba, Ontario and (starting in 1997) Quebec. Around the same time, the rival WIC television station group launched &quot;Canada Tonight&quot;, a newscast produced at WIC&#x27;s Vancouver station CHAN-TV (better known as British Columbia Television or BCTV), and also aired on its stations in Alberta and Ontario.

Following the purchase of WIC&#x27;s television stations by Global&#x27;s then-parent company Canwest, Global announced in January 2001 its plans to launch a new network newscast in September of that year, with Kevin Newman returning to Canada from ABC News as the newscast&#x27;s chief anchor. &quot;First National&quot; ended production in February, and the Global stations which had aired that program broadcast &quot;Canada Tonight&quot; in its place until the new newscast launched.

The final broadcast of &quot;Canada Tonight&quot; aired on August 31, 2001, and the new newscast, titled &quot;Global National&quot;, debuted on September 3 from a renovated studio at CHAN, which became a Global O&amp;O two days earlier and produces its local newscasts from the same studio. As part of the deal in which Global bought CHAN, it became home to Global&#x27;s national news centre; the station had wanted to do a national newscast for its former network CTV (with &quot;Canada Tonight&quot; emerging as the result after CTV&#x27;s board turned CHAN&#x27;s proposal down). When the program began, it had only 15 people on staff and a budget of $8 million; the newscast was tied in part to $20 million worth of funding Global had put aside, in exchange for the CRTC to give Global a national network license (a bid approved in January 2000); &quot;Global National&quot;, as well as public-affairs shows and &quot;wellness documentaries&quot; were the fruits of the deal.

&quot;Global National&quot; set several technological firsts; it was the first daily newscast in the world to use digital cameras in addition to videotape, as well as editing all stories on Apple&#x27;s then-new Final Cut editing software. The look and feel of the newscast was also distinctively different in comparison to other national newscasts; eschewing common elements like maps and globes, instead swirling circles in the Global house colors of red (with burgundy and orange, known internally as the &quot;vortex of news&quot;) were used with a circular logo integrating the Global &quot;crescent&quot; logo of the era; the music package was uniquely heavy on woodwinds, drums and flutes. The newscast name was originally &quot;Global Network News&quot; (or &quot;GNN&quot;), but Global&#x27;s marketing department argued for a title that was shorter and more concise.

Kevin Newman&#x27;s name was added to the program&#x27;s title from the start of its second season. The program initially only aired on weekdays; weekend broadcasts began on February 26, 2005, with Tara Nelson as the anchor. The launch of the weekend editions precipitated the cancellation of the newsmagazine series &quot;Global Sunday&quot;.

&quot;Global National&quot; initially aired in different time slots across the country: 5:30 pm in British Columbia; 6:00 in Saskatchewan and Manitoba; 6:30 pm in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec; and 11:15 pm in the Maritimes. In conjunction with the launch of Global&#x27;s new visual identity in February 2006, the program began to be aired live at 6:30 pm in the Atlantic Time Zone, and 5:30 elsewhere. This version of the program is then broadcast via satellite tape delay in time zones to the west (at 6:30 Eastern, 5:30 Central, Mountain, and Pacific, and 6:00 on CHBC Kelowna since 2009), with updates if news events warrant. This allows the newscast to air at a uniform time slot across most of the country, as well as to serve as a lead-in to local news in most markets. While strong in Western Canada from day one – particularly in British Columbia, where CHAN has dominated news ratings for four decades – the timeslot change allowed the program&#x27;s ratings in Ontario to improve significantly as a result of having &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as its lead-in; that show had previously given a strong ratings bump to CIII&#x27;s local newscast. (On October 11, 2011, CIII moved &quot;Global National&quot; back to 6:30 p.m. as part of a scheduling shift with its early evening newscast, the &quot;News Hour&quot;.)
It is often difficult to compare Canada&#x27;s national newscast ratings because the newscasts air at different times. Global decided to cut into their supper hour local newscast ratings to air &quot;Global National&quot; while rivals CTV and CBC air their national newscasts in the late evening. Despite airing in a more favorable timeslot, Global National is continually out-rated by &quot;CTV National News&quot; and maintains a slight lead over CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National.&quot;

In February 2008, Newman began presenting the weekday edition of &quot;Global National&quot; from a specially-built digital newsroom and studio facility in Ottawa. The Ottawa studio&#x27;s cameras were controlled remotely from CHAN in Vancouver, where the newscast&#x27;s main editorial and production staff remain. Similar remote-controlled greenscreen studios were introduced at a number of local Global newscasts.

Tara Nelson was named Global&#x27;s Europe bureau chief in September 2008; her position as the program&#x27;s weekend anchor was then shared by Carolyn Jarvis on Saturdays and Robin Gill on Sundays. Nelson resigned in October 2010 to become the new 6:00 pm anchor at CTV Calgary, Alberta (CFCN-DT).

Newman announced his departure from the network on April 30, 2010, and anchored the newscast for the last time on August 20, 2010. Dawna Friesen was named as his successor on July 13, 2010, and began anchoring &quot;Global National&quot; on September 20, 2010.

Carolyn Jarvis was reassigned to Global&#x27;s newsmagazine program &quot;16:9&quot; in 2011, with Robin Gill taking over as Saturday anchor alongside her pre-existing Sunday hosting duties.

==&quot;Global National Mandarin&quot;==
&quot;Global National Mandarin&quot; was a newscast aired on the Shaw Multicultural Channel in Vancouver and Calgary. On December 6, 2011, Global announced its plans to launch &quot;Global National Mandarin&quot; (Global National 国语新闻). The 30-minute Mandarin newscast debuted on January 23, 2012, with Carol Wang as anchor. It was announced on June 29, 2016, that &quot;Global National Mandarin&quot; would air its final broadcast on June 30 as it did not garner the viewership necessary to continue airing. The investigative documentary series &quot;16x9&quot; was also cancelled at this time.
