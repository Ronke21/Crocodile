<text>Mihail Manoilescu (; December 9, 1891 – December 30, 1950) was a Romanian journalist, engineer, economist, politician and memoirist, who served as Foreign Minister of Romania during the summer of 1940. An active promoter of and contributor to fascist ideology and antisemitic sentiment, he was a financial backer of the Iron Guard in the late 1930s. His corporatist ideas influenced economic policy in several countries during the 1930s, particularly in Brazil.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born to a political family in Tecuci, he was the nephew of Alexandru Bădărău, twice a minister in Conservative cabinets during the early 1900s, and a descendant of the Moldavian boyar known as ; his grandfather was strong unionist, a supporter of the Union of Moldova with Wallachia, while his father was a member of the Socialist Party. The Manoilescus moved to Iași when Mihail was a child. Having been the recipient of the &quot;Gazeta Matematică&quot; prize in 1910, he went on to study at the &quot;Școala de Poduri și Șosele&quot; (the School of Bridges and Roads) in Bucharest, completing his training as a valedictorian in 1915. Manoilescu was subsequently assigned to the Ministry of Public Works, and later moved to an artillery regiment in Roman.

Upon Romania&#x27;s entry into World War I, he was assigned to the Directorate of Ammunitions (led by Tancred Constantinescu), and designed an original type of 210 mm howitzer, which, after southern Romania was invaded by the Central Powers (&quot;see Romanian Campaign&quot;), was produced in . After the conflict, in 1919, he had a minor role in the National Liberal Party (PNL) governments, assisting General Constantinescu as Head of the Industrial Recovery Directorate and later as General Director of Industry.

===With Averescu===
Soon, Manoilescu joined the People&#x27;s Party, a populist force led by General Alexandru Averescu, becoming undersecretary of state in the latter&#x27;s first cabinet. He was responsible for measures such as organizing the Industrial Exhibition, carrying out industrial statistics, and unifying legislation related to the industry. In 1921, he resigned his ministerial position, justifying it as an attempt to further his expertise and investigative range.

During the period when the PNL returned to government, Manoilescu focused on his research, and contributed 18 individual works. He also became influential as an orator, and was a frequent presence in conferences hosted by the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti. Manoilescu returned to high office with the second Averescu executive, and drafted innovative legislation concerning tariffs and salary amortization.

In 1926, while on a mission to Italy, where he was to negotiate a loan and pave the way for the friendship treaty signed between the two countries, he met the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and became his admirer (calling the Fascist regime &quot;a truly constructive political revolution, one that can only compare itself with the great French revolution in scale and novelty&quot;). Subsequently, he was active in collaboration with the &quot;Comitati d&#x27;azione per l&#x27;universalità di Roma&quot; and other Italian-led projects of international cooperation.

===1927 trial===
He was then an advocate of the crowning of Carol Caraiman as King of Romania (in the place of his underage son Mihai). In the autumn of 1927, while distributing Carol&#x27;s appeals to the leaders of various political parties and carrying his letter to Queen Marie, he was arrested (martial law was proclaimed by the Ion I. C. Brătianu government in the incident&#x27;s wake). Manoilescu, who benefited from Averescu&#x27;s vocal support, was acquitted when tried by a court subordinated to the Council of War in late November.

His own testimony was indicated by &quot;Time&quot; as arguing that Carol was alarmed by an alleged growth in republicanism and only wished to be part of the Regency. He also stated:
&quot;The Prince is too loyal and decent to think of dethroning his own son.&quot;

While accusing the executive of having previously attempted to purchase his silence, Manoilescu stressed his belief that King Ferdinand had, just before his death, asked Brătianu for Carol to be allowed to return. He also speculated that Ferdinand had endorsed a regency only for as long as Carol continued to behave irresponsibly, and had not wanted to exclude his son from the throne. Averescu, who unsuccessfully called on both Carol and Brătianu to take the stand, backed this version by mentioning his own experience as a mediator between Ferdinand and Carol, during which the latter had allegedly agreed to comply, while the former had eventually become more open to Carol&#x27;s return.

The acquittal came as a shock, given rumors that Premier Brătianu had instructed the court to find Manoilescu guilty. In an unusual incident during the first day of trial, news correspondents from abroad were told that international phone connections had been severed—they resorted to crossing the Danube into Bulgaria at Giurgiu, using phones there to contact their employers, and repeated the trip several times over the following days.

===Camarilla===
After Carol returned to rule as &quot;Carol II&quot; in mid-1930, Manoilescu was a very influential person in the king&#x27;s &quot;camarilla&quot;, being the Minister of Economy in the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ) cabinets of Iuliu Maniu and Gheorghe Mironescu (while he was a member of that party), as well as under Nicolae Iorga (1931-1932). He was elected to the Assembly of Deputies for the PNȚ in 1930, representing Caraș County. His political adversaries speculated that he had forged documents and played a hand in bringing Carol&#x27;s mistress, Magda Lupescu, back into the country.

In his memoirs, Manoilescu claimed that, at the time, he had played a hand in the release of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor (imprisoned since 1918, due to his Bolshevik activism and designs for a communist revolution); Manoilescu authored a series of articles in his support, and allegedly intervened alongside King Carol (it is generally accepted that the most decisive action in this respect was taken by Maniu, who spoke against imprisonment for political crimes such as Bujor&#x27;s).

At the time, he became a staunch rival of his fellow PNȚ member Virgil Madgearu. According to Petre Pandrea&#x27;s hostile account, Manoilescu purchased from the writers Sergiu Dan and Ion Vinea an allegedly stolen text which appeared to be entirely written by Madgearu, but had been heavily forged by the two to include criticism of the king; Manoilescu attempted to use the document against its supposed author, but was exposed by Carol himself (who, according to Pandrea, was amused by the events). The incident contributed to PNŢ inner-conflict that caused Manoilescu to leave the grouping.

In 1931, Manoilescu was governor of the National Bank of Romania and began teaching political economy at the Polytechnic Institute. As governor, he refused to salvage the Marmorosch Blank Bank with state funds, and clashed with Carol over the issue, being ultimately removed from office in November of the same year.

He began editing a magazine, &quot;Lumea Nouă&quot;, which was to become the main platform for his ideas, and, in 1932, created his own party—&quot;Liga Național-Corporatistă&quot; (National-Corporatist League). Between 1932 and 1937, he was assigned a seat in the Senate, representing the Romanian Chamber of Commerce.

===Political and economic theories===
In Paris in 1929, he published the first version of his fundamental work, &quot;The theory of protectionism and international exchanges&quot; at the Giard publishing house (as part of the &quot;Bibliothèque Économique Internationale&quot; collection). His intense advocacy of industrialization formed the main theme of the book &quot;The role and destiny of Romania&#x27;s bourgeoisie&quot; (1942), which was one of the main works dealing with the development of a local middle class, alongside those written by Ştefan Zeletin and Eugen Lovinescu (while sharing some perspectives with the essays of Emil Cioran); the topic blended with his support for authoritarianism and the one-party system, as Manoilescu rejected democracy (which, in his view, encouraged the majority-forming peasantry to decide on matters that did not concern it). &quot;The role and destiny...&quot; criticized the course of Romanian social development:
&quot;[...] an oversized bourgeoisie which mimicks the boyars of yesteryear and has an &quot;over-bourgeois&quot; way of living, oversized in comparison with its means, creates a certain social instability and features a high percentage of individual failures.That is why &quot;the Romanian bourgeoisie is not in fact a bourgeoisie in one of its most essential features&quot;; whereas the Occident focuses on &quot;accumulation&quot;, &quot;security&quot; and &quot;the future&quot;, our bourgeoisie will focus on &quot;spending&quot;, &quot;satisfaction&quot; and &quot;the present&quot;. Whereas the Western bourgeois work for their children, the Romanian bourgeois will often only work for themselves.&quot;

Among others, Manoilescu adopted some of the Poporanist ideas on capital and its international circulation, as present in the works of Constantin Stere (in turn influenced by the Marxist Werner Sombart). He argued that a national economy could develop only if it minimized its contacts with the world market and relied instead on cultivating internal demand for a local industry.

At the same time, his magazine supported a nationalist and racist approach, viewing corporatism as &quot;the guarantee of Romanianization&quot;, and proclaiming that &quot;the racial basis of Romania is the same as that of Aryan Europe&quot;. Manoilescu himself welcomed the antisemitic policies of the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod government.

Manoilescu&#x27;s corporatist and protectionist ideas began to be applied in Brazil, as the basis of that country&#x27;s industrial development during its &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime. His opinion that the engagement of productive forces in industry, seen as always more productive than agriculture and other raw materials, is a welcomed process constituted an influence on both Celso Furtado and Raúl Prebisch (arguably, it also indirectly influenced the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean). Disputed by several neoclassical theorists, Manoilescu&#x27;s ideas were abandoned after the 1930s. Manoilescu influenced not only business circles in Brazil, but his arguments were also referred to by the Lewiatan Group in Poland. Mihail Manoilescu, together with the French economist François Perroux, prepared the way for the reception of corporatism in Brazil during the 1930s. Establishing corporatism in Brazil was partly achieved by translating and publishing into Portuguese some of Manoilescu&#x27;s works. During the Interwar, Manoilescu&#x27;s economic and political essays were published in Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Chile. His works also had some influence in Argentina, although not as much as in Brazil and Chile. On the other hand, Manoilescu&#x27;s advocacy of autarkic measures has been compared to the measures enforced by later Stalinist regimes, including that of Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania, who on at least one occasion described his works as a major contribution to the theory of underdevelopment.

===Iron Guard===
Despite the increasingly tense relations between Carol and the fascist Iron Guard, Manoilescu was viewed with interest by the latter. By the late 1930s, he was himself a supporter of the Guard (which he hoped to see turning into a corporatist movement—&quot;an instrument to validate the goals of the [Guard&#x27;s] national revolution&quot;), and donated part of his land to one of the latter&#x27;s enterprises. His new discourse was ridiculed by his former colleagues in the National Peasants&#x27; Party, as &quot;desperate attempts to exit from the [old generation of politicians] and sit among the new men&quot;. In February 1937, he began discreetly financing the Guard&#x27;s newly created paper, &quot;Buna Vestire&quot; (he was exposed as the man behind it by virtually all political commentators of the time).

In the election of 1937, he ran for the Senate on the &quot;Everything for the Fatherland Party&quot; list (which served as a front for the Iron Guard). According to his political adversary Constantin Argetoianu, the party&#x27;s unofficial leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu made similar proposals to philosopher Nae Ionescu and General Gheorghe Moruzi: Ionescu denied the request because, as a self-proclaimed pillar of the Guard, he could not accept such a lowly position, while Moruzi called Manoilescu &quot;a con artist&quot; and alluded to his reported connection with Magda Lupescu. Argetoianu sarcastically remarked, &quot;the party of «moral regeneration» was left with one guest, with Manoilescu!&quot; During the period, Manoilescu also applied changes to his earlier vision on industry and self-sufficiency, calling for Romania to develop itself by supplying raw materials to the rising force that was Nazi Germany.

===Foreign minister===

In July 1940, at the moment of crisis when Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina were ceded to the Soviet Union, Manoilescu was named foreign minister in the pro-fascist government headed by Ion Gigurtu. The new executive was faced with eventually successful attempts by Hungary, backed by Italy and Nazi Germany, to revise its border with Romania by the Treaty of Trianon, in reality a dictate. Manoilescu, who was a supporter of the Axis alliance, attempted in vain to make use of his influence with Italian authorities. In order to ensure less international adversity toward Romania, he also offered to cede Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (although Germany had not included this revision in its demands toward the Romanian executive), an approach eventually leading to the Treaty of Craiova.

As foreign minister of Romania convoked by the Axis, on August 30, he signed the Second Vienna Award, which divided Transylvania between Hungary and Romania (&quot;see Northern Transylvania&quot;). While German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, communicated the final decision, in the Gold Room of the Belvedere Palace, Manoilescu fainted, after seeing the map of the new borders, imposed by Germany and Italy, whilst the Hungarian side jubilated.

In September, he was involved in negotiations with Soviet envoys regarding a détente between the two countries; at the time, examining the situation created by warm relations between the Axis and the Soviet Union (&quot;see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact&quot;), the fall of France and the United Kingdom&#x27;s isolation (which had deprived Romania of diplomatic alternatives), Manoilescu argued that Romania looked &quot;with respect&quot; towards Moscow, Berlin, and Rome. Asked by the Soviet delegation to account for alleged new border incidents, he stiffly denied that these had ever occurred.

===1940s, imprisonment and death===
The responsibility for the Transylvanian compromise weighed heavily on him later in the following year, when the Iron Guard, revived by the leadership of Horia Sima, came to government and proclaimed the National Legionary State; it refused to appoint Manoilescu to any leadership position. He did however continue to serve as Foreign Minister during the short-lived First Antonescu cabinet, bringing the overall duration of his 1940 term to 70 days (July 4 to September 14). After the Iron Guard&#x27;s 1941 Rebellion, he remained present on the political stage as a supporter of Ion Antonescu&#x27;s dictatorship (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;). In autumn 1940, he represented his country to Rome, where he attempted to persuade Italian officials to look into information about Hungarian violence in Northern Transylvania, and, in July 1942, traveled to the Independent State of Croatia to meet with Otto Franges, his collaborator on an overview of Southeast European economy.

On October 12, 1944, as Romania signed an armistice with the United Nations, Manoilescu was jailed without trial for 14 months, during which time he was expelled from his position at the Polytechnic Institute. Because of the bad sanitary conditions in prison, he became sick with endemic typhus, and sent to the hospital for contagious diseases in Colentina. Set free in December 1945, he resumed work on his unfinished writings, and became an advocate of harvesting geothermal power in Romania (his innovations in the field were patented on the name of his son, Alexandru Manoilescu). He was once again jailed by Communist Romanian authorities on December 19, 1948, and was brought first to Jilava Prison, and then to the prison of Ocnele Mari. While being held there, Manoilescu became, together with the philosopher Petre Țuțea, a members of an &quot;underground academy&quot; organized by inmates.

Manoilescu was ultimately brought to Sighet Prison, where he died at the end of 1950. Typhus had left him with heart problems, which were aggravated in detention; with no medical attention, this led to his death; his body was buried in a common grave. In 1951, although deceased, he was brought to trial by a civil court for his journalistic activities. On April 12, 1952, he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 15 years in prison, 10 years deprivation of civil rights, and confiscation of all property, a measure which is thought to be unprecedented. His family was told of his death only in May 1958.

==Honors==
In the world of economics, Manoilescu is primarily remembered for the &quot;Manoilescu argument&quot;, which states that when the marginal productivity of labor in agriculture is lower than that in other sectors, surplus labor should be redirected to higher-productivity activities, such as manufacturing.

On 14 April 2016, the National Bank of Romania issued a set of commemorative coins in honor of three former bank governors. Manoilescu, who led the bank for several months in 1931, was among them. Manoilescu&#x27;s inclusion drew strong protests from the U.S. Embassy in Romania and the Wiesel Institute, on the grounds of Manoilescu&#x27;s advocacy of Fascist ideology and antisemitism before World War II. In spite of the criticism, the Bank did not withdraw the coin.

In the city of Ploiești, a high school bears his name, while in Tecuci a street is named after him.

<text>Girolamo Dalla Casa, also known as Girolamo da Udine and Hieronymo de Udene, was an Italian composer, instrumentalist, and writer of the late Renaissance. He was a member of the Venetian School, and more influential as a performer than as a composer.

Nothing is known about his life prior to his arrival at Venice, but he was probably born at Udine sometime before the middle of the 16th century. He was first hired by the musical establishment of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica on 29 January 1568, along with his two brothers, Giovanni and Nicolò, where they formed the first permanent instrumental ensemble.. The sonorous acoustical environment of this basilica was the center of activity of the Venetians. Giovanni Gabrieli clearly had Dalla Casa&#x27;s group in mind for much of his music, and the Dalla Casas are presumed to have played in many the elaborate polychoral compositions of the time.

In 1572, Dalla Casa served as Venetian agent for the purchase of a large number of wind instruments and printed editions of music for the court of John of Austria, half-brother of Philip II of Spain and hero of the Battle of Lepanto in the previous year. The transaction, made though the Spanish resident ambassador in Venice, Diego Guzmán de Silva, came to the considerable sum of 154 scudi, 3 lire, and 20 soldi in gold. The instruments purchased included four tenor and two soprano shawms, six alto cornetts, five mute cornetts, two large [bass?] cornetts, two dulcians, and trumpets from Nuremberg and Augsburg. An unusually large sum was charged for a &quot;&#x27;cassa di flauti grossi&quot; (chest of large recorders), which may have included several SATB consorts. The music included five printed books by Cipriano de Rore, four books by Orlando di Lasso, four books by Vincenzo Ruffo, and a collection by Pedro Guerrero, as well as other books whose contents were not specified in the receipt, which is dated 20 February 1572 and signed in Dalla Casa&#x27;s hand.

Dalla Casa was a virtuoso player of the cornett, which he described as &#x27;the most excellent of all the wind instruments ... because it mimics the human voice better than the other instruments do&#x27;.

The use of the Dalla Casas by Gabrieli and St. Mark&#x27;s foreshadowed, and may have influenced, the development of the &quot;concertino-ripieno&quot; style of the concerto grosso in the later Baroque. Being a smaller group of virtuoso instrumentalists playing in contrast to larger instrumental and vocal forces arrayed around them, and being in the center of a hugely influential stylistic movement, they functioned as an early form of &quot;concertino&quot;. Much of the music which Gabrieli and the other Venetians wrote for them survives.

Two books of madrigals and one book of motets survive from his compositional output, which probably was not large. More important to musicology, however, was his two-part 1584 treatise on ornamentation (&quot;Il vero modo di diminuir&quot;), which gives clear and precise examples of ornamentation as it was practiced in singing and playing French chansons and Italian madrigals at the time. In contrast to earlier ornamentation treatises, Dalla Casa introduced short ornamental patterns with jerky and discontinuous rhythms, such as the &quot;tremoli groppizati&quot; and &quot;groppi battute&quot;, to emphasize particular notes and heighten their emotional effect. Diminutions on intervalic skips of sixths, sevenths, and octaves also appear for the first time in this treatise, which is therefore regarded as marking the end of the purely Renaissance style of ornamentation and the beginnings of Baroque practice. From this treatise, it is clear that polyphonic works were usually performed unadorned, but works in a more homophonic style, and especially grand polychoral works with frequent sectional changes and prominent cadences, were embellished with ornaments, few of which appear in the actual notated music.

<text>Bromo-DragonFLY (or 3C-Bromo-Dragonfly, DOB-Dragonfly) is a substance related to the phenethylamine family. It acts as a potent full agonist for the 5-HT2A receptor.

==History==
Bromo-DragonFLY was first synthesized in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent dihydrofuran series of compounds nicknamed &quot;FLY&quot;, Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.

==Pharmacology==
Bromo-DragonFLY has very high affinity at the 5-HT2A (Ki 0.04 nM) and 5-HT2C receptors (Ki 0.02 nM), along with moderate affinity for 5-HT2B (Ki 0.19 nM). Bromo-DragonFLY is also a MAO-A inhibitor, increasing its risks.

==Chemistry==
The first synthesis of racemic Bromo-DragonFLY was reported by David E. Nichols in 1998 and was an expansion upon earlier research into the tetrahydrobenzodifuran analogue of DOB. The 1998 synthesis of racemic Bromo-DragonFLY starts from hydroquinone, which is dialkylated with 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, brominated, and treated with n-butyllithium to yield the tetrahydrobenzodifuran ring system. After formylation of the ring system, the nitropropene derivative was obtained by condensation with nitroethane under ammonium acetate catalysis. The nitropropene derivative was then reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to yield the amine intermediate, which was protected with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Following &quot;para&quot;-bromination with elemental bromine and oxidation of the tetrahydrobenzodifuran ring system with DDQ, the trifluoroacetyl protecting group of the amine was removed to give Bromo-DragonFLY as a racemic mixture of the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; enantiomers.

In 2001, David E. Nichols reported an enantiospecific synthesis of Bromo-DragonFLY which allowed the individual &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; enantiomers to be studied. Further research determined that (&quot;R&quot;)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY possessed greater binding affinity at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors than (&quot;S&quot;)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY. To synthesize the more active &quot;R&quot; enantiomer, a derivative of D-alanine was reacted with 2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzodifuran in a Friedel–Crafts acylation, yielding an intermediate containing a β-keto moiety which was removed by treatment with triethylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid. After &quot;para&quot;-bromination and oxidation of the ring system with DDQ, the amine was deprotected yielding (&quot;R&quot;)-(-)-Bromo-DragonFLY.

==Dosage==
Data on toxicological significance and dosage of Bromo-DragonFLY remains elusive due to lack of human consumption, however commonly reported recreational dose of this substance is in the range of 500–1000μg. However, a death has been reported at approximately 700μg Bromo-DragonFLY.

==Toxicity==

The toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans, with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY in Norway, Sweden,
Denmark,
Finland
and the United States.
Laboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-Dragonfly was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound 2C-B-FLY, which is around 20x less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity.

Vasoconstrictive action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case. In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.

Overdose-associated disturbing experiences and health problems have been described. One case in 2008 in England involved inhalation of vomit, causing nearly fatal asphyxia. Seizures have also been reported.

On October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-DragonFLY. His friend described the trip saying, &quot;It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I&#x27;ve ever tried. It lasted an eternity.&quot;

On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===United States===
Bromo-DragonFLY is unscheduled at federal level in the United States, but could possibly be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if it is sold for human consumption due to its similarities with 2C-B and DOB. Bromo-DragonFLY is listed as a Schedule I substance in Oklahoma.

===Canada===
As of Oct 12, 2016, Bromo-DragonFLY is listed in Schedule III of the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act: &quot;2C-phenethylamines and their salts, derivatives, isomers and salts of derivatives and isomers&quot;, a broad definition which corresponds to anything with a 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine core, including (but not limited to) the 2C family (including &quot;e.g.&quot; βk-2C-B), the DO&quot;x&quot; chemical class, the TMA family, Aleph &quot;aka&quot; DOT, NBOMe, the 25&quot;x&quot;-NB&quot;x&quot; series, and of course, Bromo-DragonFLY itself (see this article).

===United Kingdom===

Bromo-DragonFLY is widely reported by the media as being a Class A drug. However, as of 2014, it remains unclear to what extent it is covered by the UK phenylethylamine catch-all clause, with commentators noting both the structural similarities and differences to the phenylethylamine class. If the prosecution could demonstrate structural similarity in court, it would be considered a Class A substance but as a benzodifuran it is significantly different to this class. It is not explicitly named in the misuse of drugs act. It would be covered by the UK Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 but only if it is sold or traded for human consumption.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdag&quot; added Bromo-Dragonfly to schedule IV (&quot;substances, plant materials and fungi that hasn&#x27;t any or without nothing medical use&quot;) as narcotics in Sweden as of Jan 3, 2008, published by &quot;Medical Products Agency&quot; in their regulation LVFS 2007:14 listed as Bromo-Dragonfly, brombensodifuranyl-isopropylamin. Bromo-DragonFLY was first classified as &quot;health hazard&quot; by &quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry under the act (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Jul 15, 2007, in their regulation SFS 2007:600 listed as brombensodifuranylisopropylamin (Bromo-Dragonfly), making it illegal to sell, purchase, buy, retail or possess.

===Denmark===
On December 3, 2007, the drug was banned in Denmark. The substance has been declared illegal by health minister Jakob Axel Nielsen, following recommendations from the Danish Health Ministry. It is currently classified as a dangerous narcotic and therefore its possession, manufacture, importation, supply or usage is strictly prohibited. Anyone involved in such activities can face legal action.

===Norway===
Bromo-DragonFLY is currently on the Norwegian narcotics list.

===Poland===

Currently, Bromo-DragonFLY is an uncontrolled substance in Poland.

===Romania===
The chemical compound has been added as an illegal substance under the Law 143/2000 on February 10, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleModified Romanian law 143/2000 on January 10, 2010.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
As of 9 September 2011, Bromo-DragonFLY was added to Schedule 2 of the Queensland Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987.

Nationally, the drug is listed under Schedule 9 (Prohibited) of the Poisons Standard. Accordingly, the drug is prohibited in all states and territories.

===Finland===
As of 12 March 2012, Bromo-DragonFLY is an illegal designer drug.

<text>The 1988 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 42nd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1988 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1988 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 3 April and ended on 13 November. The World Championship for Drivers was won by Ayrton Senna, and the World Championship for Constructors by McLaren-Honda. Senna and McLaren teammate Alain Prost won fifteen of the sixteen races between them; the only race neither driver won was the Italian Grand Prix, where Ferrari&#x27;s Gerhard Berger took an emotional victory four weeks after the death of team founder Enzo Ferrari. McLaren&#x27;s win tally has only been bettered or equalled in seasons with more than sixteen races; their Constructors&#x27; Championship tally of 199 points, more than three times that of any other constructor, was also a record until .

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors competed in the 1988 season. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear.

===Team changes===

* Naturally aspirated engines would become mandatory from onwards and this year already saw severe restrictions on the turbocharged units (see &quot;Regulation changes&quot;), so four teams took the gamble of making the switch early, hoping to give themselves an extra year to get used to the new regulations. Among them most notably was constructors&#x27; champion Williams; they were powered by the new Judd CV 3.5L V8. March and Ligier made the same choice. The other obvious way was to use the Ford-Cosworth DFZ V8&#x27;s, but they ran a year behind in development, and Benetton had gained exclusive rights to use the superiour Cosworth DFR engine. Minardi made this choice, bringing the number of Cosworth-powered teams to ten in total. Looking for an advantage now that they couldn&#x27;t rely on superior Honda turbo power, Williams added their reactive suspension system to the new Williams FW12. But 5% of the engine power was needed to run the computer-controlled system properly and, with the weight of the system, it made the already underpowered Judd V8 sluggish compared to its rivals.
* Osella kept using the Alfa Romeo 890T V8 turbo, but without factory support from the Italians, re-badged it as the &quot;Osella V8&quot;. It produced around , making it the second most powerful engine on paper, but it often proved slower than even the year-old Cosworths.
* McLaren and Lotus, customers of Honda, received the RA168E engine, specifically designed to cope with the limits placed on turbo output (see &quot;Regulation changes&quot;). This was hoped to give Honda teams an advantage, as all other engines had been designed in accordance to the previous rule set. Besides this, Lotus made what turned out to be the right choice, by stepping away from active suspension systems.
* The March team employed a new designer, who would go on to produce many successful F1 cars in his career: Adrian Newey designed the sleek-looking and aerodynamically effective March 881 for the team&#x27;s second season back in F1.
* There were three new teams on the grid this year:
** BMS Scuderia Italia, using a Dallara chassis,
** Rial, ex-owner of the ATS team, and
** EuroBrun, who had bought the remains of the Brabham team from Bernie Ecclestone. It would be the first time since that the Brabham team would miss on the grid. After losing use of the turbo BMW engines and failing to secure a replacement, and after missing the FIA&#x27;s entry deadline for the 1988 season, team owner Bernie Ecclestone announced Brabham&#x27;s withdrawal before the opening race in Brazil.

===Driver changes===

* Despite winning his third championship with Williams, Nelson Piquet left his team. A heated battle with teammate Nigel Mansell left the pair&#x27;s relationship sour. Riccardo Patrese was signed as his replacement. Piquet moved to Team Lotus, where a seat became available after it was announced that Ayrton Senna moved to McLaren to join Alain Prost.
* Before the 1987 Austrian Grand Prix, it was announced that Minardi driver Alessandro Nannini would replace Teo Fabi at Benetton. Fabi took out his frustration on his teammate Thierry Boutsen during the race, blocking him for many laps and not moving over for blue flags.
* In 1987, Julian Bailey became the first British driver to win a Formula 3000 race. This landed him a drive for Tyrrell F1 for 1988. Bailey was one of the five drivers making his debut at the beginning of the season.
* Another ten driver switches happened in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====
* Martin Brundle was test driver for Williams in 1988 and fell in for Nigel Mansell at the Belgian Grand Prix, after Mansell was struck down with chickenpox. For the Italian Grand Prix, Williams called upon Jean-Louis Schlesser to make his debut, since Brundle had prior commitments in IMSA. The French driver made himself (in)famous by crashing into leader Ayrton Senna when the Brazilian tried to lap him for the second time. The McLaren spun out, paving the way for a Ferrari 1-2 finish on home soil. It was McLaren&#x27;s only race in the year they did not win.
* After failing to qualify in three consecutive races, Adrián Campos left Minardi unmotivated. The team replaced him with Pierluigi Martini, having raced for them in as well.
* Larrousse driver Yannick Dalmas fell ill near the end of the season. To replace him, Aguri Suzuki made his debut at his home race. For the final race, Pierre-Henri Raphanel stepped in, for his debut as well.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
The Austrian Grand Prix was dropped from the 1988 calendar due to safety concerns with the Österreichring, the narrow pit straight resulting in the 1987 race having to be restarted twice and Stefan Johansson hitting a small reindeer during the practice session, destroying his car and breaking his ribs in the process. This led to a re-organisation of the calendar, with the Belgian Grand Prix being moved from late May to late August to fill the slot traditionally occupied by the Austrian Grand Prix, and the Mexican Grand Prix being moved from mid-October to late May.

The Canadian Grand Prix returned after a year away, taking place in mid-June as the second race in a three-race North American tour, preceded by the Mexican Grand Prix and followed by the Detroit Grand Prix the following week.

==Regulation changes==
===Technical regulations===
The FIA continued their strategy from , to make naturally aspirated engines more attractive, ahead of the ban on turbocharged engines from on:
* The turbo boost was limited at , after it had already been brought down to for 1987. The FIA handled this by mandating that the valves would &quot;pop off&quot; when the pressure went over the limit. This led to the turbo-powered cars producing approximately less than the year before.
* The fuel limit for turbo engines was set at , down from for 1987, while teams running with a naturally aspirated engine could carry and use unlimited amounts of fuel during a race.

The FIA also introduced some new safety measures:
* The driver&#x27;s feet should be positioned behind the front axis of the car.
* The survival cell and fuel tank would now have to pass a static crash test.

===Sporting and event regulations===
* The Jim Clark and Colin Chapman trophies, awarded the previous year for drivers and constructors, respectively, who were using naturally aspirated engines, had been withdrawn as such engines would become mandatory from 1989 onwards,
* 31 drivers entered the first race, but it was decided that only 30 cars should be allowed to participate in the qualifying sessions. So pre-qualifying, which had been used in several races during the late 1970s and early 1980s, was re-introduced. For 1988, this consisted of five cars taking part in an extra session on Friday morning before the first session of qualifying proper, with the slowest car to miss out on the rest of the weekend.
* A permanent FIA race director would be present and active at all race meetings.

==Season report==


===Pre-season===
The pre-season was a very contentious time, with many theories of the championship flying around: whether the Honda engines would prove successful with McLaren; whether Ferrari would be able to continue the trend set by the last two rounds of , in which Gerhard Berger scored successive victories in Japan and Australia; whether Williams would be able to continue their success without Honda and Nelson Piquet; and whether reigning world champion Piquet could succeed in defending his title with the Honda-powered Lotus.

Pre-season testing in Rio de Janeiro at the newly named Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet (formerly known as the Jacarepaguá Circuit) was dominated by Ferrari seemingly continuing on with the form that saw Gerhard Berger win the final two races of 1987. Both Berger and Michele Alboreto set times during the Rio tests which were significantly faster than anyone else, and faster than had been recorded during the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix, prompting rumours that the Scuderia had been running their cars without the FIA&#x27;s mandatory pop-off valve, or had the valve set at 1987&#x27;s 4.0 bar limit. The rumours seemed to carry weight when just a month later for the opening race at the same circuit when the pop-off valves were to be in use, neither Berger nor Alboreto could get near their testing times from the previous month, and both were well down on top speed compared to the McLaren and Lotus-Hondas.

===Season===
====Round 1 – Brazil====
For the first race of the season in Brazil, with Ferrari being the only completely stable option and having dominated the Rio tests the previous month, many agreed that both Berger and Alboreto (should he find the motivation) would be in serious contention, and this was supported in Berger&#x27;s second place behind Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren as well as setting the fastest race lap for the Ferrari. Though in a post-race interview Berger warned that Ferrari had a lot of work to do to catch up with Honda as the Ferrari V6 seemed to lack power compared to its rivals. Remarkable also, was Nigel Mansell&#x27;s recovery from his accident in Japan to score a front row position for his non-turbo Judd-powered Williams on his first race back. Making Mansell&#x27;s lap even more remarkable was that his Judd engined Williams FW12 was only timed at only on the long back straight compared to over for the Honda turbos of McLaren and Lotus. Mansell was the first non-turbo front row starter in Formula One since Keke Rosberg had qualified his Williams-Ford on pole at the same circuit for the opening race of the season.

Of the new teams and drivers, both EuroBruns qualified for the race, as did the Rial of Andrea de Cesaris, while Luis Pérez-Sala also qualified his Minardi-Ford. The Tyrrell-Ford of Julian Bailey failed to qualify, as did the turbocharged Zakspeed of Bernd Schneider. The converted F3000 Dallara-Ford of Alex Caffi failed to pre-qualify for its only race, with the full F1 chassis ready before the next race.

Senna&#x27;s first race for McLaren got off to a bad start when the cars gear selector broke on the grid, causing a restart. The Brazilian was eventually disqualified for switching to the spare car after the green flag had been waved following the warm-up lap. At the time he had risen up to second place after starting from the pits. Making it look easy and confirming his mastery of the circuit, Prost won his fifth Brazilian Grand Prix in seven years, easing off over the last few laps to ensure he finished with enough fuel not to be underweight to finish 10 seconds in front of Berger, with World Champion Nelson Piquet finishing third in his first race for Lotus-Honda. With Derek Warwick (Arrows-Megatron), Alboreto (Ferrari) and Satoru Nakajima (Lotus-Honda) finishing 4th, 5th and 6th respectively the points were a clean sweep for the turbo powered cars, though Mansell and the Benettons of Boutsen and Nannini did run in the points for long periods of the race.

====Round 2 – San Marino====
At Imola however, it was plain to see that Steve Nichols&#x27; McLaren MP4/4, combined with the championship winning Honda V6 turbo, was in a class of its own. In qualifying both Senna and Prost were 3 seconds faster than the Lotus-Honda of Piquet in 3rd. At the end of the race Senna and Prost (who had almost stalled at the start and was only in 8th by the time the field got to Tosa, giving Senna a clear track while Prost took a number of laps to get to second) had lapped the entire field, with teammate Prost only 2.3 seconds behind a fuel conserving Senna at the finish. Indeed, both McLarens set faster race laps than anyone else had qualified. The McLarens lapping the field with 5 laps remaining was bad news for the normally-aspirated Benettons of Thierry Boutsen and Alessandro Nannini: as the lapped cars had a reduced distance to complete the race, the turbos of Piquet (Lotus) and Berger (Ferrari) had less need to stretch their fuel and now could afford to up their turbo boost if needed. Over the final 5 laps, Piquet pulled away from a challenging Boutsen (who was down on power due to a cracked exhaust), while Berger passed Nannini for 5th place on the last lap by cutting the grass at the Acque Minerali chicane, though no action was taken for cutting a corner to make a pass for position.

During qualifying, World Champion and the last driver to win the title driving a naturally aspirated car Keke Rosberg, said in an interview at about the new rules that if you ignored the McLarens it was quite a competitive race between the turbos and the &#x27;atmos&#x27;. Considering that the Imola circuit had always been considered a power track that spelled good news for the FIA&#x27;s turbo restriction rules, especially with drivers of the faster atmo cars, Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Judd and the Benetton-Fords of Nannini and Boutsen, regularly challenging the turbos of Lotus-Honda (fastest through the speed trap in qualifying at ), Ferrari and Arrows-Megatron, though the McLarens (which were 1.5 km/h slower at Tosa than Piquet in qualifying) were out of reach of everyone. The acceleration of the Honda V6 turbo in the sleek, lowline McLaren, and their downforce in the corners was unsurpassed. That, combined with who many considered the two best drivers in the world, saw the McLarens simply in another league at Imola. Though most in the F1 paddock and the press agreed that while Senna and Prost were the best drivers, all things being equal they weren&#x27;t three seconds a lap faster than every one else.

For the first time since the team entered Formula One in , both Ligiers failed to qualify for a race. Stefan Johansson, who could boast 11 podium finishes over the past 3 seasons with Ferrari and McLaren, could only manage 28th fastest, with 7 time Grands Prix winner René Arnoux (who also had 18 pole positions to his credit, including 2 at Imola) could only manage 29th fastest. Both drivers were over 8.5 seconds slower than Senna&#x27;s pole time. The problem for the Ligiers was a lack of downforce from the Judd powered JS31 with Johansson telling that he had to use a wet weather technique even on a dry track.

====Round 3 – Monaco====
Despite what many expected, the championship would hardly be considered boring with the McLaren onslaught peaking with the drivers fighting in several feuds. At Monaco, after Alain Prost set the fastest lap, Senna refused to accept that his teammate could be driving faster than he was, especially after Senna outqualified Prost by over a second. Senna pushed and after taking back the fastest lap, Ron Dennis got on the radio and told his drivers to effectively &#x27;cool it&#x27; as Senna&#x27;s lead was 50 seconds with only 12 laps remaining. Senna, his rhythm broken, then had a major lapse in concentration and hit the wall at Portier. What made Senna&#x27;s mistake all the more astounding was that he had completely dominated the weekend, taking pole by 1.4 seconds from Prost (who was 1.2 seconds faster than Berger&#x27;s 3rd placed Ferrari) and from the start of the race had simply run away and hid from the field.

Prost, who had made the best start but was passed in quick succession by Senna and Berger when he couldn&#x27;t engage second gear, spent 54 laps trying to find a way around the Ferrari as his teammate pulled away by almost a second per lap. The McLaren got alongside the Ferrari many times past the pits but simply ran out of room to pass before Sainte Dévote. Finally, on lap 54, Prost got a good run out of the final turn and was able to out brake Berger going into Sainte Dévote. He then set about pulling away from the Ferrari while also trying to put some pressure on Senna. Thanks to Senna&#x27;s crash, Berger picked up second place behind Prost with teammate Alboreto third.

After Senna&#x27;s crash, the McLaren team didn&#x27;t see or hear from him until that night as he didn&#x27;t return to the pits until the team was packing up after the race. As the Brazilian lived in Monaco, the general belief was that he went back to his home to contemplate losing a race he had totally dominated.

====Round 4 – Mexico====
In Mexico, it was nearly a repeat of San Marino: McLaren 1–2, with this time only one other driver on the lead lap. Gerhard Berger had picked up his third podium in four races, giving him the edge on Piquet and Alboreto for the title of &quot;Best of the Rest&quot; – the race for third. As expected, turbo cars dominated in the thin air of Mexico City, with the front three rows of the grid shared between the McLaren-Hondas, Ferraris, Lotus-Hondas. This dominance continued in the race. Behind the Prost-Senna 1–2 came a Ferrari 3–4 with Alboreto finishing behind his teammate, while Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever finished 5th and 6th after a race long dice in their Arrows-Megatron turbos. Warwick and Cheever would later remark that their race was &quot;good fun&quot;.

In the thin air of Mexico City&#x27;s high altitude, the turbos were able to perform at their optimum, while the naturally aspirated cars actually lost approximately 20–25% of their power. This advantage allowed the Zakspeed of Bernd Schneider to qualify an impressive 15th for his first Grand Prix start in what wasn&#x27;t the most competitive car in the field. Incredibly though, the turbocharged Osella of Nicola Larini with its ancient &quot;Osella V8&quot; (a re-badged Alfa Romeo 890T first seen in 1983), allegedly the most powerful engine in the field, failed to qualify.

The last qualifying session was dominated by Philippe Alliot&#x27;s terrifying crash after he lost control of his Lola, coming out of the Peraltada curve that leads onto the pit straight (the Peraltada, being slightly banked, was being taken at speeds in excess of in qualifying). After riding the outside curbing, the car suddenly pulled hard right, cut across the track and collided with the pit wall, barrel-rolling down the straight and back across the track, immediately disintegrating, and in the end stopped upside down in the middle of the track. Remarkably, Alliot was not only unhurt, but the Larrousse team was able to rebuild the car overnight and Alliot was able to take his place on the starting grid.

The fastest atmo qualifier, the Benetton-Ford of Alessandro Nannini, finished in 7th place. The Italian, who finished just in front of teammate Thierry Boutsen after another race long duel between teammates, finished the race without a point and in severe pain from a pinched nerve in his right foot from never having to drive as hard for so long.

Honda&#x27;s 1–2 finish with McLaren had its flip side though as both Nelson Piquet and Satoru Nakajima failed to finish due to blown Honda engines.

====Round 5 – Canada====
After not racing in Canada in 1987 due to a sponsorship dispute, Formula One returned to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix. The circuit had been changed since the last visit in 1986, with the pits relocated to the opposite end of the circuit, the new complex gaining general approval from those who mattered, the teams themselves. Canada again proved a repeat of the McLaren onslaught, this time Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton being the only other car on the lead lap, and 50 seconds behind. Canada saw the first on-track fight for the lead between the two McLaren drivers. Prost won the start and led until lap 19 when Senna passed him under braking for the L&#x27;Epingle Hairpin. The Brazilian then pulled away from his teammate to win by 5 seconds, with Boutsen and further 46 seconds back in third.

Nelson Piquet&#x27;s season of disappointment continued with a 4th-place finish in his Lotus-Honda, again one lap down on the McLarens. After qualifying 6th, the reigning World Champion was passed early on by ex-teammate Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Judd, and then spent many laps fighting off the AGS-Ford of Philippe Streiff until the Frenchman suffered suspension failure on lap 41.

====Round 6 – Detroit====
This was repeated in Detroit, however this time third placed Boutsen failed to stay on the lead lap as Senna took his second victory in a row, and his third in a row in Detroit, making it six out of six for McLaren and Honda. Prost finished 38.7 seconds behind in second. For the first time since Brazil, there was something other than a McLaren on the front row. Gerhard Berger qualified second behind Senna (who took his record 7th straight pole position), with Alboreto third and Prost only managing fourth on the grid on his least favorite track on the calendar. This would prove to be the final ever Formula One Detroit Grand Prix, the temporary street circuit failing to meet the FIA&#x27;s minimum pit requirements.

====Round 7 – France====
The French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard saw another 1–2 for McLaren, this time with Prost at the helm for his home Grand Prix, followed by the Ferraris, though this time Alboreto led home Berger with the Italian the only driver not lapped by the McLarens. Piquet raced a brilliant race, despite losing second gear, to come through for a fifth place. For the first time in 1988, Ayrton Senna was not on pole position. In France it was French hero Prost who qualified fastest almost half a second up on his teammate. The race saw the second true fight of the season between the McLarens, with Prost coming out on top after a brave passing move at the ultra fast Courbe de Signes when Senna had been momentarily baulked by the Dallara of Alex Caffi and the Minardi of Pierluigi Martini.

At the team&#x27;s home Grand Prix, Ligier suffered the embarrassment of neither René Arnoux (who turned 40 the day after the race) or Stefan Johansson being able to qualify for the race.

====Round 8 – Britain====
At the wet British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Nigel Mansell surprised all by scoring a second place for an atmos car for his first finish of the season after seven races of DNFs, a result which definitely pleased the hordes of British fans who were still gripped in Mansell-mania despite the driver&#x27;s (or rather, the car&#x27;s) lacklustre performance through the year. Senna won, with the podium rounded off by Nannini, proving that Silverstone was an unusually good race for the atmos cars. Silverstone also saw the only non-McLaren pole position when Gerhard Berger claimed pole in his Ferrari. It was also the only time neither McLaren qualified on the front row as Alboreto qualified second.

Mansell&#x27;s race was helped when the &#x27;reactive suspension&#x27; used on the Williams FW12 was dumped by the team after Friday qualifying and a conventional suspension was put in its place. Team Technical Director Patrick Head called the work &quot;a bit of a bodge&quot;, but the new suspension transformed the car and allowed Mansell and teammate Riccardo Patrese to enter the race with confidence for the first time all season (after Friday qualifying, Patrese had been 30th and last, almost 21 seconds slower than provisional pole man Alboreto).

Prost got a horror start and was down in 9th at the end of the first lap with BBC commentator and World Champion James Hunt noting as early as lap 2 that his Honda engine was badly misfiring. Prost was later lapped by his teammate going into Woodcote in a move that also saw Senna take the lead for the first time from Berger. Prost suffered his first DNF of the season when he retired on lap 24 citing an engine misfire and poor handling, though in complete contrast to his win in France a week earlier, he was attacked in the French press, many of whom felt he had simply given up.

McLaren had dominated, winning the first eight races of the season, with Prost and Senna winning four each. Prost led the championship with 54 points from Senna on 48 and Gerhard Berger on 21. McLaren were making a mockery of the Constructors&#x27; Championship having scored 102 points, 68 in front of second placed Ferrari.

====Round 9 – Germany====
Germany proved a return to the year&#x27;s trend, with the long straights of Hockenheim showcasing the brute strength of the turbos, with the only atmos car on the lead lap behind both McLarens and Ferraris respectively being Capelli&#x27;s March. Capelli recorded the fastest &#x27;atmo&#x27; speed trap of the season during qualifying, the Judd V8 pushing the March 881 to , though this was significantly slower than the McLarens at , and Ferraris at . Unable to exploit the power of their Megatron turbos thanks to the pop-off valve regularly cutting in at around 2.3 bar instead of the full 2.5 bar limit, the Arrows A10Bs of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever struggled, only trapping at around .

Gerhard Berger survived a high speed spin in qualifying. His Ferrari was attempting to pass the EuroBrun of Oscar Larrauri and the Arrows of Eddie Cheever on the final straight before the stadium section of the track. Berger went to his left to pass both cars only to find Cheever had done the same to pass Larrauri, and the American had what was left of the road. At almost , the Ferrari put its left wheels on the grass, sending it into a spin between the Arrows and EuroBrun. Luckily, Larrauri had only been cruising at the time and was able to avoid the spinning Ferrari. Berger managed to stop his car before it hit the barrier on the opposite side of the track.

In the second wet race in a row, Senna took the win from Prost, with Berger taking the bottom step of the rostrum. Alessandro Nannini set his first career fastest lap in his Benetton-Ford V8. The Italian had been in 4th place before having to pit to fix a broken throttle bracket which cost him 4 laps and almost 20 places and angrily drove the rest of the race flat out, setting a time that was 1.856 seconds faster than the next best set by Prost. Defending World Champion Nelson Piquet made the strange decision to start the race on slick tyres. It proved to be the wrong choice as his Lotus aquaplaned on the wet surface and clouted the tyre barrier going into the Ostkurve chicane on the first lap. Larrousse driver Philippe Alliot would later repeat Piquet&#x27;s mistake. He changed from wets to slicks just 8 laps later and while being lapped by Senna, went offline and aquaplaned into the same tyre barrier the Lotus had hit. Like Piquet&#x27;s Lotus, Alliot&#x27;s Lola was out on the spot with rear suspension damage.

====Round 10 – Hungary====
At the following Grand Prix at Hungary, Senna secured his 24th pole position, securing the third highest total after legendary champions Jim Clark and Juan Manuel Fangio, backing his qualifying effort up by taking victory over teammate Prost by just over half a second. This was Senna&#x27;s sixth win of the season, and third on the trot, with Prost on just four wins.

Despite suffering from Chickenpox, Nigel Mansell secured his first front row start since the opening race in Brazil. On the tight and twisty Hungaroring, the only turbo powered cars in the top 7 were the McLarens, with Prost down in 7th place. Mansell got the better of the start and briefly led, but before the first turn the power of the Honda turbo told and Senna was through into the lead. Mansell and teammate Riccardo Patrese then pressured Senna until Mansell spun his Williams on lap 12, dropping him to 4th place. Patrese then set about taking the lead from Senna but was forced to drop back with engine trouble and would eventually finish 6th.

Prost&#x27;s race was better than qualifying, and though he again made a slow start and was 9th at the end of the opening lap, he fought his way up to second behind Senna on lap 47. On lap 49 he took the lead from Senna down the pit straight in a breathtaking move where he not only passed Senna but also the lapped Yannick Dalmas and Gabriele Tarquini. Unfortunately his burst of speed also saw him run wide at the first corner allowing Senna to dive underneath and re-take the lead. From that point Prost&#x27;s McLaren developed a vibration which saw him drop back from Senna, though he again charged late in the race and was only half a second behind at the finish. Thierry Boutsen once more finished &quot;best of the rest&quot; in his Benetton, finishing half a minute behind the McLarens, his race not helped by a broken exhaust which robbed the Ford DFR of power. Rounding out the points were Berger, Gugelmin and Patrese. After a race long duel, the Lotus pair finished out of the points in 7th and 8th respectively, with Satoru Nakajima gaining praise for finishing in front of his more illustrious teammate. Nakajima and Piquet finished 3 laps behind the McLarens.

====Round 11 – Belgium====
The 1988 Belgian Grand Prix showed Prost one thing: to not change his set-up at the last minute. All through the year, Prost&#x27;s better feel at setting up a car was not only noticed by his teammate, but mimicked. Senna had used Prost&#x27;s set-ups for every race thus far, and the race at Spa was no different. This annoyed Prost, and he changed his aero-settings at the last minute (running less wing with the hopes of being faster on the straights and the long run from Stavelot to the Bus Stop chicane), hoping to give himself an edge over the pole-sitting Senna. At the start, Prost took the lead after Senna suffered wheel spin, but on the first lap Senna with greater downforce was noticeably faster through Eau Rouge. Despite running with more wing than his teammate, Senna was able to then slipstream Prost up the Kemmel Straight and easily out braked him into Les Combes. From there Senna steadily drew away from his teammate who was unhappy with the balance of his car after his last minute setting change, going on to take an easy 30 second win. Third and fourth was filled by the two Benettons, however they were both disqualified from the results long after the race had ended for using illegal fuel (in fact, the DQ was not known until after the season had ended meaning most publications showed the Benettons as finishing 3rd and 4th). This saw Ivan Capelli gain his first ever podium in Formula One. The 1–2 for McLaren meant that the points gap became big enough that Ferrari lost any chance of catching them in Constructors&#x27; Championship, securing McLaren one of the earliest recorded Constructors&#x27; Championship victories.

After racing in Hungary against doctors orders, Nigel Mansell was forced to miss the Belgian Grand Prix through illness and was replaced by Martin Brundle, who after four years in F1 was driving a V12 Jaguar XJR-9 for Tom Walkinshaw Racing in the 1988 World Sportscar Championship (Brundle would win that championship). After qualifying 12th, and actually being fastest in the 2nd, wet qualifying session, Brundle finished in 7th place, one lap behind his former British Formula 3 rival Senna.

Two weeks before the Belgian Grand Prix, Formula One lost its best known and one of its most loved people. Enzo Ferrari, the founding father of Ferrari and its F1 team Scuderia Ferrari, died on 14 August at the age of 90. In the first race since the death of their teams founder, Berger and Alboreto qualified 3rd and 4th respectively with Alboreto being the fastest through the speed trap on the Kemmel Straight at . Both were a DNF in the race however, Berger out on lap 11 with injection trouble, and while Alboreto&#x27;s engine blew on lap 35.

====Round 12 – Italy====
Before the Italian Grand Prix, Prost was quoted as saying that, as it was very possible that McLaren would take out a perfect sixteen out of sixteen victories, the winner would be determined between which McLaren driver would take the most wins, and on the chance they both took eight, it would be determined on their second places, which at the time Prost had more of despite having fewer wins. This meant Prost with 4 wins to Senna&#x27;s 7 could only let Senna win one more time.

Monza, being another high speed circuit, would prove to be another McLaren dominated race, with both sitting on the front row, again with both Ferraris behind. The race fell into regular routine as Senna led from the start and Prost close behind. Prost had actually won the start, but as he changed gear from 1st to 2nd, his Honda engine began to misfire, allowing Senna to power past before the Retifillo chicane. At the end of the first lap with Senna holding a 2-second lead, Prost, correctly believing the misfire was bad enough that he wouldn&#x27;t finish the race, turned his turbo boost up to full and gave chase. However, on lap 35 of 51, Prost&#x27;s championship hopes seemed to evaporate when his Honda engine finally blew. The tifosi cheered as their drivers were shifted to second and third, albeit some 30 seconds behind Senna, and Honda were left embarrassed with one of their engines expiring on their main rivals (Ferrari) home track. Unfortunately for McLaren though, what Prost had done was to force Senna to use too much fuel in his desire to stay in the lead (many in the pits, including his former Lotus team boss Peter Warr believed that Senna had effectively been suckered by Prost and should have realised that if he was using too much fuel then Prost was also, something Prost did not usually do). This forced Senna to back off over the last 16 laps in order to ensure a finish, and it allowed the Ferraris to close the gap from 30 seconds when Prost retired, to just over 5 seconds with just two laps remaining as Senna came up to lap the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser, standing in for the still unwell Nigel Mansell.

Senna, knowing the Ferraris were closing in, dived under Schlesser&#x27;s Williams at the Rettifilo chicane instead of waiting for the long, fast Curva Grande that would follow. Senna took his normal line through the corner while Schlesser moved over to give him room. The Williams locked its brakes in the dust and marbles on the edge of the circuit and slid wide. Schlesser (a noted rally driver who was used to such things) then regained control and turned the Williams to avoid the sand trap and found Senna had not allowed any room for the Frenchman to rejoin the circuit. The Williams T-boned the right rear tyre of the McLaren, breaking its rear suspension and destroying any hopes of a perfect winning season for McLaren. The tifosi erupted as the #12 McLaren was beached on a curb and out of the race; Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto sat first and second, where they remained at the finish only half a second apart. The victory was made poignant by the fact that it was the first Italian Grand Prix since Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s death. Both drivers and team dedicated the victory to the &quot;old man&quot;. This race would prove to be the only chink in McLaren&#x27;s perfect year and their only double retirement.

Arrows, whose engine guru Heini Mader had finally solved the Megatron engine&#x27;s pop-off valve problem giving them comparable power to the Honda and Ferrari engines (approximately ), finished 3rd and 4th, with Cheever gaining the final spot on the rostrum just six-tenths in front of Derek Warwick. It would prove to be the final podium finish for both Arrows with their old BMW M12 engine (re-badged as Megatron in 1987) which had been introduced to F1 with the Brabham team back in . With full power now available, during qualifying Cheever pushed his Arrows A10B to , comfortably faster than the McLarens and Ferraris which were timed at .

====Round 13 – Portugal====
The following Grand Prix in Portugal proved to be an exciting affair, for all but Ayrton Senna who suffered race long with handling troubles. He ended sixth while Prost retook the championship lead by obtaining his fifth victory of the year. March driver Ivan Capelli secured his second career podium with a brilliant second, with Boutsen once again finishing third in his Benetton. As the field finished the first lap of the race, Prost, who had claimed his second pole of the year (and pulled a psychological ploy on Senna by setting his time early in the final session, then spending the rest of the session lounging in the McLaren pits wearing jeans and a T-shirt, almost daring the Brazilian to beat him), pulled out of Senna&#x27;s slipstream to pass his teammate for the lead down the straight. In a famous vision, Senna almost pushed his teammate into the pit wall at over , something which didn&#x27;t please the race winner. This was after Prost had tried to block Senna and pushed him close to the grass during one of the aborted starts.

====Round 14 – Spain====
At the Spanish Grand Prix, Prost secured his sixth win of the season, again in an attempt to delay an almost inevitable eighth race win for Senna – that would secure his first of three championships. As in Portugal, Senna suffered from fuel gauge problems, as well an overheating engine and was lucky to secure fourth. Nigel Mansell doubled his British Grand Prix efforts and scored another six points. He moved into second early and while never seriously threatening Prost for the lead, it was only a slow stop for tyres on lap 47 which prevented the Englishman from pressuring the Frenchman late in the race. Alessandro Nannini continued to impress when drove a steady race to finish third in his Benetton.

During qualifying, Grand Prix&#x27;s most experienced driver Riccardo Patrese was fined $10,000 for brake testing the Tyrrell of Julian Bailey. Patrese&#x27;s action, which caused the Tyrrell to hit the back of the Williams, fly into the air and off the track into a gravel trap, was widely condemned by those in the paddock. One unnamed driver was quoted as saying &quot;I hope they fine him his bloody retainer. There are enough accidental shunts in this business without people actually trying to cause them...&quot;

====Round 15 – Japan====
The penultimate round in Japan was, once again, where the title was decided. This time it was the end of the weekend, and not the beginning. Prost made a superb start to the lead, whilst Senna stalled, lucky in the fact that Suzuka had a sloping grid, helping to start his car. Senna knew he had nothing to lose and everything to gain in this race, and knew he could seal the championship here. By the end of the lap he had already made up six positions, and by the fourth lap he was sitting in fourth position. The top six cars were all sitting very close and when the rain started to fall, so did Prost. Capelli took this chance to become the first naturally aspirated car to lead a Grand Prix in over 4 years, thrilling the March team. Unfortunately, this was not to last as his electronics would eventually fail. By then, Senna was hot on the tail of Prost. Prost disliked the wet, and his failing gearbox only added to the Brazilian&#x27;s chances. When the pair came round to lap some back-markers, as Prost was caught up with de Cesaris, Senna went past to take the lead, and set three consecutive fastest laps and setting a new lap record. As he was now in front of the field of competitors and due to become world champion, he signaled to stop the race. However, the race ran its full distance and Honda were reveling in their 1–2 finish, whilst Prost was bitter, but readily accepted that Senna was a deserving champion.

Other than those with Honda engines, the Japanese fans had two local drivers to cheer for the first time. Japanese Formula 3000 champion Aguri Suzuki was substituting for the sick Yannick Dalmas in the Larrousse team (Dalmas would later be diagnosed with Legionaire&#x27;s Disease). Suzuki joined Satoru Nakajima as the only Japanese drivers in F1 at the time. The much-maligned Nakajima won praise at the meeting when he drove despite finding out only 30 minutes before the first practice session that his mother had died that morning. The inspired Japanese driver was faster than his World Champion teammate Piquet on the first day of qualifying, and matched the Brazilian&#x27;s time to the thousandth of a second during the second session.

====Round 16 – Australia====
McLaren secured their 12th 1–2 qualifying for the season, with Senna setting his record 13th pole for the year, again doing his last minute act by literally beating Prost&#x27;s time on the last lap of qualifying. In the last turbo Formula One race until the season, Bernd Schneider failed to qualify his Zakspeed, while Nicola Larini failed to pre-qualify the Osella. A relaxed Nigel Mansell, in his last race in his first spell for Williams, qualified 3rd, though he wasn&#x27;t confident going into the race as both he and Riccardo Patrese had suffered brake trouble all through practice and qualifying and the Adelaide Street Circuit had been notoriously hard on brakes in its 3 race history.

Before the race Gerhard Berger told both Prost and Senna that with it being the last race for the turbos he was going to &quot;go for it&quot; and run the race with full turbo boost. He reasoned it was better to go out in the lead rather than just drone around in the wake of the McLarens. True to his word, Berger led the race by using maximum turbo boost in his engine and had passed Prost for the lead on lap 14. His race was only to last another 9 laps though as he crashed with René Arnoux on lap 25. After that the race turned into another McLaren demonstration, though late in the race Nelson Piquet did briefly threaten Senna who had been having gear selection problems almost from the start. Mansell&#x27;s fear of the Williams&#x27;s brakes came to fruition when he spun into the barriers on lap 65 simply through having no brakes left. He had been in fourth place at the time just in front of Patrese, but had not been able to truly challenge Piquet who was able to use Honda power on the 900-metre-long Brabham Straight to keep his former teammates at bay.

Prost would go on to win in Adelaide, leading home Senna and outgoing champion Nelson Piquet giving Honda turbos a fitting 1–2–3 finish in the final race of the first turbo era in Formula One. Prost&#x27;s win over Senna in Australia saw him score eleven more points in total than the Brazilian, but only the eleven highest scores counted, with Senna&#x27;s eight wins and three seconds giving him a total of 90 points to Prost&#x27;s 87. While Prost agreed that Senna deserved his championship win, he went on to be a proponent of the 1990s scoring system, where all results would count to the final results with the winner scoring 10, not 9, points.

===Summary===
Incredibly, of the 14 races Alain Prost finished in 1988 he would record seven wins and seven second places, yet it wasn&#x27;t enough to win the championship. His wins total equaled the single season record he himself had equalled in (Jim Clark had won 7 races in ) when he had also lost the world championship to then McLaren teammate Niki Lauda. However, unlike Lauda who scored 5 wins and it was his regular points finishes that gave him his 3rd championship, the wins record now belonged to Senna who finished with eight wins. Senna also set the single season pole winning record by claiming the fastest time on thirteen occasions during the year, finishing the season with 29 career pole positions, only four behind the record, which was another held by the great Jim Clark.

In Adelaide, FOCA boss Bernie Ecclestone summed up the season by saying that what McLaren had actually done was nothing more than their usual professional job and that they didn&#x27;t really do anything exceptional. With the Honda turbo they clearly had the best engines, and in Senna and Prost they had the two best drivers. The problem was that just about every other team performed well below par and the McLarens were rarely challenged. He then jokingly added that all the teams, including McLaren, would have to up their performance in as Brabham (which he had sold to EuroBrun owner Walter Brun) would be back in Formula One.

While the McLaren-Honda cars had dominated the 1988 Formula One season like no-one had before, the FIA&#x27;s rules to limit turbo cars&#x27; boost and fuel tank size had the desired effect of bringing the atmospheric cars back into contention. This was shown by front row starts for Nigel Mansell in Brazil and Hungary, as well as three second-place and eight third-place finishes for the non-turbo cars, and on each occasion that a non-turbo car finished on the podium, the only cars to finish in front of them were the all-conquering McLaren-Hondas.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. For the Drivers&#x27; Championship, the best eleven results were counted, while, for the Constructors&#x27; Championship, all rounds were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

 Driver did not finish the Grand Prix, but was classified as he completed over 90% of the race distance.

* Only the best 11 results counted toward the championship. Prost scored 105 points during the year, but only 87 points were counted toward the championship. Senna scored 94 points, with 90 points counted toward the championship by virtue of winning more races. Thus, Senna became the World Champion, although he did not score the most points over the course of the year.

===World Constructors&#x27; Championship standings===
==Non-championship event results==
The 1988 season also included a single event which did not count towards the World Championship, the Formula One Indoor Trophy at the Bologna Motor Show.

<text>The 1987 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 41st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 12 April and ended on 15 November.

The World Championship for Drivers was won by Nelson Piquet for the third and final time. He won just three races, compared to his teammate and main rival Nigel Mansell with six wins, but Mansell had to give up the challenge when he crashed in practice for the Japanese Grand Prix and injured his back. The World Championship for Constructors was won by Williams-Honda for the second consecutive year. The season also encompassed the Jim Clark Trophy and the Colin Chapman Trophy, which were respectively contested by drivers and constructors of Formula One cars powered by naturally aspirated engines.

This was the first season since that Renault were absent as an engine supplier in the sport due to ongoing company restructuring.

Pirelli&#x27;s withdrawal from F1 at the end of meant that Goodyear was the sole tyre supplier for 1987. It was the first season since that the sport featured a standard single tyre supplier.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors competed in the 1987 season. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear as Pirelli exited the sport after six seasons.
===Team changes===
* Renault had withdrawn from Formula One at the end of last year, so their three customers had to look for new contracts:
** Lotus bought one-year-old Honda engines;
** Ligier were due to run new Alfa Romeo four-cylinder turbo engines, but when driver René Arnoux compared them to &quot;used food&quot;, Alfa&#x27;s owner FIAT withdrew from the collaboration. The team had to miss the first race of the season while they modified their car to fit one-year-old BMW turbo engines rebadged as Megatron (BMW limited their factory support to Brabham);
** Tyrrell signed a contract for Ford-Cosworth V8&#x27;s, preparing them for the new regulations banning turbos in .
* AGS also made the switch to Cosworth naturally aspirated V8&#x27;s.
* Benetton, too, signed a deal with Ford-Cosworth, but for a V6 turbo, because of its specific design features that could hopefully avoid the effects of the limited turbo boost (see &quot;Regulation changes&quot;), at least more than their rivals&#x27; turbo engines.
* McLaren lost designer John Barnard to Ferrari, but gained the services of Gordon Murray and Neil Oatley.
* Arrows attracted Ross Brawn as technical director, joining from the Haas Lola team.

====Mid-season changes====
* The FIA&#x27;s ban on turbocharged engines in made the entry to Formula One technologically easier and cheaper. The first team attracted to the grid was Scuderia Coloni, a successful squad in the Italian Formula Three Championship. They entered the Italian and Spanish Grand Prix, before participating in the full season a year later.

===Driver changes===

* Keke Rosberg retired from Formula One, opening the door at McLaren for Stefan Johansson, after he got replaced at Ferrari by Gerhard Berger.
* Satoru Nakajima made his debut at Lotus, next to Ayrton Senna, having won six out of seven championships in Japanese Formula Two. His promotion was backed by Honda.
* Martin Brundle and Jonathan Palmer switched teams, Brundle moving to Zakspeed and Palmer to Tyrrell. Palmer endured a more successful year, winning the Jim Clark Trophy as highest-scoring driver with a non-turbocharged car.
* Another sixteen driver changes happened in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====
* By 1987, Osella were going at the season race by race and asking drivers to bring sponsorship or their own money. In such a construction, Gabriele Tarquini made his debut during the San Marino Grand Prix. And likewise, Franco Forini drove three races for the team.
* 1986 Italian F3 champion Nicola Larini debuted with Scuderia Coloni. He had driven for the team in F3.
* F3000 driver Yannick Dalmas made his debut during the Mexican Grand Prix, and staying until the end of the season, driving a second Larrousse car next to Philippe Alliot.
* Due to poor results, AGS replaced Pascal Fabre with Roberto Moreno, with two races left in the year. Moreno had one previous experience in F1, as test driver for Lotus in .
* Brabham driver Riccardo Patrese was given the opportunity to replace Nigel Mansell for the last race of the season, when the Williams driver was injured during qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix. He had already been signed by Williams for . 1987 F3000 champion Stefano Modena stepped in to make his debut at Brabham.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Belgian Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Monaco round follows the Belgian Grand Prix.
* The British Grand Prix was moved to the Silverstone Circuit after they signed a five-year deal to host the Grand Prix.
* The German Grand Prix reverted to Hockenheim run by the Automobilclub von Deutschland forcing out the Nürburgring who were run by ADAC.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from mid April to late September.
* The Japanese Grand Prix returned after a 10-year absence; it was hosted at the Honda owned Suzuka International Racing Course on 1 November.
* The Canadian Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held on 14 June but was cancelled due to a dispute between two rival breweries, Labatt and Molson in sponsoring the race.1987 was the first season since 1975 that there was no Canadian Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==
It had already been set that turbocharged engines would be banned from on. The FIA tried to make an early switch to naturally aspirated engines appetising:
* Naturally aspirated engines could now have a maximum displacement of 3.5 litres, up from 3.0.
* The fuel limit for turbo engines was set at , while teams running with a naturally aspirated engine could carry and use unlimited amounts of fuel during a race.
* The turbo boost was now limited at . The FIA handled this by mandating that the valves would &quot;pop off&quot; when the pressure went over the limit. This led to the turbo-powered cars producing approximately less than the year before. However, the rate of development in areas like aerodynamics and tyres was such that the leading turbo-running teams practically negated the restriction on power.

The FIA banned super-soft (and sticky) qualifying tyres to eliminate the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.

==Season report==
===Race 1: Brazil===
The first race in April at the fast, rough and abrasive Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil resulted in a dominant showing from Williams-Honda with Mansell ahead of Piquet. Then came Senna, Fabi, Prost, Boutsen, Berger, Warwick, Alboreto and Johansson.

The March team suffered a setback on race morning when it ran out of engines, and so the field was down to 22. At the start, Piquet took the lead from the fast-starting Senna while Mansell made a bad start and had to fight his way back to third. On lap seven Piquet suddenly went into the pits, his car having picked up paper in its radiators. He rejoined back in 11th position, leaving Senna to lead Mansell although the British driver was soon in the pits as well to have his radiators cleared. He rejoined behind Piquet and the pair then began to climb through the field. Senna pitted because of handling trouble and so Prost went into the lead and when he stopped for new tyres Boutsen briefly led before Piquet went back into the lead before his second stop. Prost then went ahead again and led for the rest of the afternoon, never looking threatened as he did not have a third tire stop while his rivals Senna and Piquet did. Mansell&#x27;s race was disrupted by a puncture while Senna went out with engine failure and so Prost came home to win ahead of Piquet, Johansson, Berger, Boutsen and Mansell.

===Race 2: San Marino (Imola, Italy)===
After the season-opening race in Brazil there was a three-week gap during which March finished building the first 871 chassis for Capelli. Osella expanded to two cars with the second being run by a youngster called Gabriele Tarquini, while Brundle had the first of Zakspeed&#x27;s new 871 chassis. Ligier was back in action with Megatron-engined cars for Rene Arnoux and Piercarlo Ghinzani. In addition there was another new team in the form of Gerard Larrousse&#x27;s Lola-Ford/Cosworth team which had employed Philippe Alliot.

But come the San Marino Grand Prix held at the fast Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Italy, Nelson Piquet had a huge accident at the flat out Tamburello corner when he suffered a tire failure during qualifying and was forbidden from racing by F1 doctor Sid Watkins. Goodyear decided that in the interests of safety it would fly in new tyres overnight for Saturday qualifying. On Saturday afternoon Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Honda with Nigel Mansell second quickest in his Williams-Honda. The second row featured Teo Fabi (Benetton-Ford) and Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) with the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger together on the third row. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and the two Arrows-Megatrons of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever. Senna led from the start but on the second lap at Tosa, Mansell swept into the lead and began to pull away. On Lap 6 Prost found a way ahead of Senna and then clawed his way up behind Mansell and stayed there. Prost&#x27;s race ended, however, on Lap 15 when the McLaren suffered an alternator failure. By then Alboreto had got ahead of Senna and so was in second place with Senna third and Patrese fourth. Mansell stopped earlier than planned for new tyres but was still ahead when everyone reemerged from their first stops. Patrese had moved to second with Alboreto and Senna chasing. In the closing laps Patrese dropped back because he had used too much fuel and so Alboreto was second until he lost boost pressure and Senna went ahead again. Mansell took the flag just under half a minute ahead of Senna with Alboreto third. Johansson was fourth, Martin Brundle fifth (scoring Zakspeed&#x27;s first points) and Satoru Nakajima picking up sixth in his Lotus-Honda.

===Race 3: Belgium===
The high-speed circuit tour kept coming, and next was the Belgian Grand Prix at the magnificent and fast Spa-Francorchamps public road circuit near Liege. The field was much as it had been at the San Marino GP a fortnight earlier, although Osella was back to one car again. Nelson Piquet was back in action after his huge crash at Imola while Zakspeed had two 871 chassis for Martin Brundle and Christian Danner, the German having used an older car in the two previous races. Qualifying saw the two Williams-Hondas at the front with Mansell on pole by nearly 1.5 seconds while Ayrton Senna was third in his Lotus-Honda ahead of the two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton-Ford/Cosworth, Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Brabham-BMW, Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton and Stefan Johansson in the second McLaren. At the start Mansell took the lead and led Senna, Piquet, Alboreto and Prost. At the start of the second lap Philippe Streiff lost control of his Tyrrell at Raidillon and smashed into the barriers, the impact tearing the engine from the car. Jonathan Palmer then arrived on the scene in the second Tyrrell and smashed into the wreck of Streiff&#x27;s car. The race was stopped but both men were unhurt, although the Tyrrell team&#x27;s cars were demolished. The race was restarted which was good luck for Berger and home favorite Boutsen who had collided at the Bus Stop chicane. This time Senna took the lead from Mansell although halfway around the first lap Nigel tried to overtake and the two cars collided and both spun. Senna was out but Mansell was able to get going again. This put Piquet into the lead and Mansell at the back. He would continue until damage from the incident caused him to stop on lap 17, and after he retired, he marched to the Lotus pits to confront Senna, resulting Mansell grabbing Senna by the throat and then the two drivers got into a fist fight. Both had to be separated Second place belonged to Alboreto with Prost third, Boutsen fourth and Fabi fifth after Berger went out with an engine failure. Piquet went out with an engine failure after 10 laps and with Alboreto stopping with a broken CV joint, Prost went into the lead with Boutsen second and Johansson third, the Swede having overtaken Fabi. Stefan then closed on Boutsen and moved to second on lap 17. The pits stops changed little but in the latter part of the race Boutsen fell behind a charged-up Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW). Boutsen finally retired with a broken CV joint which left fourth place to Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron) with Satoru Nakajima&#x27;s Lotus-Honda and Rene Arnoux sixth in the Ligier-Megatron.

===Race 4: Monaco===
There were no changes in the entry after the Belgian GP and so it was business as usual at Monaco where the three leading Honda-engined cars were at the front as usual with Nigel Mansell taking pole in his Williams, Ayrton Senna second in the Lotus and Nelson Piquet third in the second Williams. Alain Prost was fourth for the McLaren-TAG team with Michele Alboreto fifth in his Ferrari. Sixth place was a surprise in the form of Eddie Cheever&#x27;s Arrows-Megatron while the top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren-TAG), Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW). Alboreto had a spectacular crash when he ran into the back of Christian Danner&#x27;s Zakspeed on the climb after Ste Devote. The Ferrari flew through the air but fortunately landed back on the track. With 26 cars starting at Monaco for the first time there were worries about safety in the race. At the start Mansell went straight into the lead so there was no chance of a repetition of his collision with Senna at Spa. The Brazilian was second with Piquet third ahead of Alboreto, Prost and Cheever. The order at the front remained unchanged until Lap 30 when Mansell slowed with a loss of boost pressure. Senna went into the lead and stayed there all the way to the flag, despite stopping for tyres. Piquet stayed second while Prost moved to third, overhauling Cheever who ran third for much of the mid-race. In the closing laps Prost suffered an engine failure and so third place went to Alboreto with Berger fourth (after Cheever went out with engine failure), Jonathan Palmer fifth in his Tyrrell and Ivan Capelli sixth in the Leyton House March.

===Race 5: Detroit (USA)===
The Canadian Grand Prix had been cancelled due to a dispute over local sponsors Molson and Labatt&#x27;s; so Detroit was the only North American round in the middle of the European season. This race, on the slowest circuit of the season was generally considered to be the toughest and most demanding race of the season, due to the tight and extremely bumpy downtown Detroit city streets lined with concrete walls. The entry was unchanged from the field that had raced at Monaco three weeks earlier and as usual the battle for pole position was between the Honda-powered cars with Nigel Mansell fastest on this occasion with his Williams. Just behind him was Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus and Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams. There was then a big gap back to Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton-Ford, Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG, Eddie Cheever&#x27;s Arrows-Megatron and Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari. The top 10 was completed by Teo Fabi (Benetton), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and Derek Warwick in the second Arrows. Mansell took the lead at the start and began to pull away from Senna while behind in the midfield Stefan Johansson (McLaren) damaged a front wing on the back of Warwick&#x27;s Arrows and Satoru Nakajima (Lotus-Honda) crashed into the back of Ivan Capelli&#x27;s Leyton House March and then managed to collide with Adrian Campos&#x27;s Minardi at the next corner. Behind the two front-runners Piquet had trouble keeping Cheever behind him and eventually gave himself a puncture when he tapped a wheel and had to pit for new tyres. Cheever then had to fight to hold off Fabi and on lap seven the Benetton driver tried to pass and made a mess of it and ended up removing the nose of his car. Both drivers pitted, Fabi to retire and Cheever for new tyres. He rejoined at the back. This left Alboreto third ahead of Boutsen and Prost and the only change in the next few laps was as Prost moved up ahead of the Benetton. Alboreto went out with gearbox failure and so Prost was third as the pit stops approached. During the stops Mansell had a wheel nut stick on his car and lost 10 seconds and that meant that Senna went into the lead with Mansell second, Prost third and Piquet, who had charged up through the field in fourth. Nelson continued his charge and overtook Prost and closed on Mansell, who was suffering from leg cramps. He eventually fell behind the Brazilian, Prost and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). Senna won at his ease with Piquet second and Prost third. The remaining points went to Berger, Mansell and the recovering Cheever.

===Race 6: France===
At the French Grand Prix held at the Paul Ricard circuit near the French Riviera city of Le Castellet, the battle of the Honda powered cars was interrupted in France by a good performance from Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG which qualified second to Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams. The second row featured Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Honda and Nelson Piquet in the second Williams while fifth place went to Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) with Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) following the first four rows. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson&#x27;s McLaren and Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron. Mansell made a good start to lead Prost into the first corner but on the back straight Piquet blasted ahead of the McLaren to make it a Williams 1–2 with Prost third and Senna fourth ahead of the two Benettons, Boutsen ahead of Fabi. This order did not change although Mansell ran into trouble when he ran over debris from Johansson who had had an accident with Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham) at the first corner. On lap 19 Piquet had a moment and lost second place to Prost but during the pits stops the Brazilian managed to get ahead of both Prost and Mansell. Mansell quickly retook second from Prost and closed up on Piquet but overtaking was another issue until Piquet made a mistake and ran wide on lap 46 and Mansell went ahead. At the second round of stops Piquet stalled in the pitlane and lost just under 10 secs and so Mansell was able to win. Nelson finished second while Prost and Senna were third and fourth ahead of Fabi with the final point going to Philippe Streiff in the Tyrrell-Ford/Cosworth.

===Race 7: Britain===
The Mansell-Piquet intra-team battle continued at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone with victory in qualifying going to Nelson Piquet who beat his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell to pole by less than a tenth of a second. Third was Ayrton Senna in his Lotus while Alain Prost was fourth fastest in his McLaren-TAG. The third row of the grid was shared by the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi while row four was an all-Ferrari affair with Michele Alboreto just ahead of Gerhard Berger. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris&#x27;s Brabham-BMW and the second McLaren driven by Stefan Johansson. There was disappointment for Ligier with Piercarlo Ghinzani being excluded from the meeting after he ran out of fuel on the circuit and was then refueled and push-started by his mechanics. The Italian also did a couple of extra laps at the end of the first qualifying and the catalogue of rule-breaking proved to be too much for the stewards to accept. The Silverstone circuit, which was originally the fastest circuit on the calendar had been modified: the Woodcote chicane had been taken out and replaced with a slower chicane further down the Bridge straight. In what was to be a classic race Prost made a better start than both Williams drivers and took the lead but at the second corner Piquet blasted ahead of the Frenchman and almost immediately Mansell followed Piquet through. It was going to be a straight fight between the two of them. The pace of the Williams drivers and the superiority of the Williams FW11B on high-speed tracks meant that Mansell and Piquet lapped the entire field near the end of the race. Piquet had led for most of the afternoon but in the closing laps, with the home crowd roaring him on and having pitted for a fresh set of tires (Piquet had decided to go the entire distance on one set), Mansell closed up on Piquet and at Stowe Corner on lap 63 of 65 Mansell went ahead of his rival with a stunning passing maneuver. The pace of the two Williams cars was so furious that they lapped the entire field on a dry circuit. On the slowing down lap Mansell ran out of fuel, and the Honda engine in his car blew up. Third place went to Senna with fourth going to Satoru Nakajima in the second Lotus-Honda and the remaining points going to Derek Warwick (Arrows-Megatron/BMW) and Fabi.

===Race 8: Germany===
Going into the German Grand Prix at the very fast Hockenheimring with its forested straights, the World Championship was finely balanced at the midseason with Nelson Piquet leading on 39 points, Ayrton Senna second with 35, Nigel Mansell third with 30 and Alain Prost fourth with 26. Qualifying resulted in Mansell beating Senna to pole with Prost third, edging Piquet to fourth. Michele Alboreto was fifth fastest in his Ferrari with Thierry Boutsen sixth for Benetton. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). At the start Senna took the lead with Mansell slow away but he recovered to be second by the end of the first lap ahead of Prost, Piquet, Boutsen, Alboreto and Johansson. At the start of the second lap Mansell went ahead and it was clear that Senna was holding everyone up behind him. Prost went by later on the second lap and Piquet followed on the third lap. Prost was able to close up to Mansell and on lap seven the Frenchman went ahead. Further back in the field the attrition rate was high but at the front little changed until lap 19 when Prost pitted for tires. When Mansell pitted on lap 23 Prost went ahead again. Mansell hoped to catch the McLaren but his engine failed on lap 25 and so Piquet moved to second place while Senna pitted twice trying to solve a serious handling problem and dropped back, leaving Johansson in third place after Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton had blown its engine. Prost seemed to have the race won but with four laps to go an alternator belt broke and he was forced to retire. Victory thus went to Piquet with Johansson second, Senna third and stragglers picking up the other points: Philippe Streiff and Jonathan Palmer coming home fourth and fifth in their Tyrrells and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola. The only other man running was Martin Brundle in his Zakspeed 10 laps behind the winner. The attrition rate was in fact so high in this race that only 6 of 26 starting cars finished – the lowest number since the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix. Most of the failures in this race were engine- or turbo-related; the 1.5L turbo-charged cars were producing around 950 hp in race trim.

===Race 9: Hungary===
The big news at the Hungarian Grand Prix at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród was that Ayrton Senna had informed Lotus that he would not be staying with the team in 1988. Team boss Peter Warr moved quickly and signed Nelson Piquet, who was unhappy that Frank Williams would not give him clear number one status at Williams. Senna was going to join Alain Prost at McLaren. Qualifying for the race at Hungaroring saw Ferrari making a step forward as Gerhard Berger qualified second behind Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Honda. Nelson Piquet was third with Alain Prost fourth in his McLaren while Michele Alboreto was fifth in the second Ferrari and Senna sixth. The top ten was completed by Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Stefan Johansson&#x27;s McLaren, Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron/BMW and Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Brabham-BMW. Mansell took the lead at the start with Berger making a slightly hesitant start which allowed Piquet to take second before Berger retook the place with a brave outside overtaking maneuver at the first corner. Piquet then lost third place to Alboreto and so it was Mansell being chased by the two Ferraris, with Piquet fourth ahead of Senna, Prost, Boutsen and Johansson. Berger&#x27;s race would be short-lived as he retired after 13 laps with differential failure. This moved Alboreto to second and Piquet to third and the order stayed the same until Piquet overtook Alboreto on lap 29. Senna was fourth with Boutsen fifth and Prost sixth. The order remained unchanged until lap 44 when Alboreto disappeared with an engine problem and then in the closing laps Prost moved ahead of Boutsen. On lap 71 of 76 Mansell&#x27;s car lost its right rear wheel nut and he was forced to retire, and victory went to Piquet- this was a major blow to Mansell&#x27;s championship hopes. Senna was second with Prost third ahead of Boutsen, Patrese and Warwick.

===Race 10: Austria===
Nelson Piquet&#x27;s fortunate win in Hungary gave him a seven-point lead in the World Championship over Ayrton Senna with Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost 11 points behind Senna. At the Austrian Grand Prix, held at the scenic and spectacular Österreichring, the fastest Grand Prix circuit of the year Nigel Mansell was handicapped slightly by the fact that he had had a wisdom tooth removed before practice began and this affected his performance in qualifying, allowing his Williams-Honda teammate Nelson Piquet to take pole position at an incredible average speed of 159 mph (255 km/h). Mansell was second with Gerhard Berger third in his Ferrari and Thierry Boutsen fourth in his Benetton-Ford, just ahead of his teammate Teo Fabi. Michele Alboreto was sixth in the second Ferrari ahead of Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Honda, Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Brabham-BMW, Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren and Andrea de Cesaris in the second Brabham. Stefan Johansson had a big fright in practice when he found a deer in the middle of the road and hit it at high speed. This destroyed the McLaren&#x27;s suspension and he crashed heavily, cracking a rib in the ensuing accident.

The safety of the Austrian track was becoming more of an issue and on race day the problems were underlined again. The narrow pit straight – which had caused problems at Grands Prix for years and one that the organizers had failed to widen – became the center topic of the debate of safety. At the start Piquet got away ahead of a fast-starting Fabi but the race was stopped when Martin Brundle&#x27;s Zakspeed went out of control, hit a barrier and bounced back into the middle for the track. Rene Arnoux (Ligier) and Adrian Campos (Minardi) collided while the two Tyrrells hit one another and Piercarlo Ghinzani&#x27;s Ligier was also out with a broken suspension.

The grid was reformed and the field tried to get away again. Piquet went into the lead but Mansell had a problem and was crawling away slowly. Berger too slowed suddenly as he tried to pass the Williams and so there was serious congestion behind with the result that Patrese hit Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron). Johansson hit the back of Cheever and Brundle hit the rear of the McLaren. This resulted in Ghinzani braking and being hit by Alex Caffi&#x27;s Osella and Ivan Capelli (March), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola), Christian Danner (Zakspeed) and Philippe Streiff (Tyrrell) all becoming involved and then Pascal Fabre (AGS) driving over the back of Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s Tyrrell. The track was blocked again and the race red flagged for a second time.

Remarkably most of the field was able to take the third start with only Streiff missing, although Brundle, Caffi, Danner and Fabre all started from the pitlane. Prost&#x27;s McLaren refused to get away and so he jumped into the spare and joined the queue in the pitlane. At the end of the parade lap Alboreto went into the pits to have his steering wheel fixed and so there were sixth cars starting from pitlane. This time Senna stalled but everyone avoided the Lotus and Piquet took the lead from Boutsen, Berger, Mansell and Fabi. At the tail of the field Senna, Prost and Alboreto were beginning to charge through the backmarkers. Berger disappeared with a turbo failure after only a few laps and Boutsen disappeared on lap 15 with a gear-linkage which had come loose. This left Piquet and Mansell at the front with Fabi third. On lap 21 Mansell took the lead as the two Williams drivers were diving through backmarkers going down the straight leading to the Bosch-Kurve. Once ahead Mansell was able to keep his lead at the pit stops and Fabi remained third so attention turned to the battles further down the field as Alboreto and Senna battling it out. The two collided and Senna had to pit for a new front wing. He dropped out of the points but managed to pick up places when Alboreto retired with an exhaust problem and Prost was slowed with a similar failure. This meant that Boutsen was fourth with Senna fifth and Prost sixth.

This would be the last Austrian Grand Prix for 10 years; the race would return to the same shortened venue in 1997.

===Race 11: Italy===
The field was expanded at the Monza Autodrome near Milan by the arrival of the new Coloni team, fielding Nicola Larini. The Osella team expanded to two cars with the Swiss Franco Forini joining Alex Caffi. Honda had announced that it would not be supplying Williams with engines in 1988, despite the fact the Japanese company still had one year to go on its contract. Honda had decided that it wanted to be with McLaren. This led to questions over whether Honda would treat the two Williams drivers fairly in the battle for the World Championship as Nelson Piquet would be a Honda driver in 1988 and Mansell would not. The Honda men said that it made no difference but few believed them. The Williams team had its new active-suspension system ready and Nelson Piquet used it, while Nigel Mansell stayed with a conventional car. Piquet took pole position with Mansell a tenth behind him but Ayrton Senna was beaten to third place by Gerhard Berger&#x27;s Ferrari. Then came Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG, Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton. The top 10 was completed by the two Brabhams of Andrea de Cesaris and Riccardo Patrese. At the start of the race Mansell made a good start but then missed a gearchange and so Piquet went into the lead at the first corner with Berger third ahead of Boutsen, Prost and Senna. At the start of the second lap Berger challenged for second place and Mansell closed the door so the two cars collided and Boutsen moved to second place with Berger third and Mansell fourth. The order then remained the same until Mansell was finally able to pass Berger on lap 17. he then overtook Boutsen as well. The mid-race pit stops put Senna into the lead and it looked as though he might be able to go without a pit stop as he had done in Monaco and Detroit. The two Williams-Hondas were second and third with Boutsen behind them. Senna looked fine until lap 43 when he was lapping Piercarlo Ghinzani&#x27;s Ligier and went off across a sand trap at the Parabolica. By the time he was back on the track Piquet was in the lead. Senna tried to regain the place but his tires would not allow him to challenge and so they finished with Piquet winning the race. Mansell was third with Berger fourth, Boutsen fifth and Stefan Johansson (McLaren) sixth.

===Race 12: Portugal===
At the Estoril Autodrome near the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, the Coloni team did not reappear in Portugal but Osella continued to run a second car for Franco Forini. Ferrari&#x27;s progress throughout the summer months was confirmed with Gerhard Berger taking pole position ahead of Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Honda, Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren and Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams. Ayrton Senna was fifth in his Lotus-Honda and the top 10 was completed by Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari, Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Brabham, Stefan Johansson&#x27;s McLaren and the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi. At the start Mansell took the lead from Berger but behind them Alboreto collided with Piquet. Derek Warwick spun his Arrows to avoid them and then Satoru Nakajima (Lotus) collided with Martin Brundle (Zakspeed) and the rest of the field piled into the wrecks. The result was that Adrian Campos (Minardi), Christian Danner (Zakspeed), Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola) and Eddie Cheever (Arrows) were also involved. The race was stopped, and at the restart everyone was able to start apart from Danner. Mansell went into the lead again. At the end of the first lap, however, Berger took the lead and with Senna fighting off Piquet for third place the race began to settle down. It took Piquet until the eleventh lap to overtake Senna. Mansell pressured Berger early on but then dropped away as his engine began to misfire and on lap 14 stopped on the circuit. Senna slowed and went into the pits with an electronic problem while Alboreto closed up on Piquet and began to make life difficult for the Brazilian. He eventually got ahead but Piquet soon retaliated. The mid-race pitstops elevated Prost to second place ahead of Piquet and Fabi, while Alboreto disappeared with a transmission failure. The order remained unchanged until the closing laps as Prost gradually closed on Berger and put the Austrian under pressure. On lap 68 of 70 Berger crumbled under the pressure and spun. Prost was in the lead and duly won his 28th victory, to beat Jackie Stewart&#x27;s long-established record of 27 Grand Prix victories, a record he held until Michael Schumacher surpassed with 52 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. A disappointed Berger was second with Piquet third, Fabi fourth, Johansson fifth and Cheever sixth.

===Race 13: Spain===
The Spanish Grand Prix had been moved to being the final Grand Prix in Europe of the year, and at the Jerez circuit near Seville in southern Spain, the Coloni team was back in action and with Franco Forini staying on for a third event with the Osella team the field was up to 28 cars. The battle for pole position was between the two Williams-Honda with World Championship leader Nelson Piquet (in an active Williams) on pole ahead of challenger Nigel Mansell (who chose to use the passive car). The two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto were third and fourth with Ayrton Senna fifth in his Lotus-Honda. Teo Fabi was sixth in his Benetton-Ford with Alain Prost (McLaren), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) and the two Brabhams of Riccardo Patrese and Andrea de Cesaris rounding off the top 10. In the race Piquet took the lead but Mansell dived ahead at the end of the first lap and began to pull away from the Brazilian. Senna was third with the two Ferraris and Boutsen chasing. The top five did not change for the first half of the race with Senna at the front of a train of cars. At the pitstops Mansell was away and gone before Senna arrived but Piquet was slower and found himself stuck in fourth place behind Senna and Prost. He challenged Prost but got it wrong and spun back to sixth place. Senna had decided to go through without a stop and those behind him were left to battle with one another while Mansell drove on to victory. Senna&#x27;s gamble did not pay off because his tires deteriorated quickly and eventually Piquet, Boutsen and Prost were all able to get ahead. Senna then dropped back behind Johansson as well. Piquet then made a mistake and ran wide but Boutsen also made a mistake and spun and so Prost was second with Johansson third, Piquet fourth, Senna fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola.

===Race 14: Mexico===
The Formula One circus moved from one Hispanophonic country to another; this time to Mexico 3 weeks after the Spanish round. This race, held at the high-altitude and very bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome located within a recreational public park in the middle of Mexico City was the 450th Formula One Grand Prix, and the field was much as it had been all season, the only changes being that Osella had gone back to one car and Larrousse has expanded to two with Yannick Dalmas joining Philippe Alliot. Nelson Piquet was 18 points ahead with three races to go and so Nigel Mansell needed a good result without Piquet scoring too well. The atmosphere in the Williams had deteriorated badly between the two drivers to the point where team boss Frank Williams had admitted that he could not do anything to make things better but as Ayrton Senna was out of the running for the World Championship there was no chance that the two could take points from one another as they had in 1986 and let a third driver win the title. In qualifying the drivers found that thanks to the geologically active land the Mexico City track, already made challenging by the humid heat, dust and smog had become more bumpy than last year and there were a series of big accidents, including one of Mansell, and another for Ayrton Senna. The drivers were all complaining intensely about the track surface to FIA personnel, but not much could be done at this point. Mansell was on pole from Gerhard Berger second in his Ferrari ahead of Piquet, Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Senna. The top 10 was rounded off by Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) and Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham). This Grand Prix was a very unusual race, and at the start Mansell made a bad start and was overtaken by Berger, Boutsen, Piquet and Prost. At the first corner Piquet and Prost tangled and both cars spun. Prost was out but Piquet got going again with assistance from the track marshals. Mansell had moved up to third, and there were further incidents down through the field with Stefan Johansson being spinning and being eliminated when he was hit by Christian Danner, and Nakajima crashing into the back of Derek Warwick&#x27;s Arrows at the end of the main straight. At the front Boutsen took the lead from Berger on the second lap with Mansell a distant third but then the Benetton began to misfire and Berger went back into the lead and Boutsen went out with electronic injection trouble. Berger retired six laps later with engine failure and with Alboreto also having disappeared Ferrari&#x27;s race was over. Mansell was thus left in the lead with Senna second and Patrese third and Piquet fourth. Then there were red flags after Warwick (Arrows-Megatron) had a huge accident at the final corner when something broke at the back of his car as a result of Nakajima running into him earlier. A new grid was formed up based on the order of the cars before the crash with the race being decided on aggregate. Piquet took the lead at the restart but with Mansell sitting behind him there was no way he could win the race. In the closing laps Senna spun off and so Piquet ended up in second place having done enough to beat Patrese on aggregate. Eddie Cheever was fourth in his Arrows with Fabi fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth.

===Race 15: Japan===
Formula 1 returned to Japan for the first time in 10 years and the circus came for the first time to the twisty, very demanding Honda-owned Suzuka track near Nagoya having been at the very fast Fuji Speedway in 1977. An exciting World Championship showdown between Williams-Honda teammates Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell was on the cards, Piquet was 12 points ahead of Mansell. During qualifying Mansell crashed heavily at the fast Snake sweepers behind the paddock, the accident left him with severe bruising to his backbone, re-triggering an old injury and it was decided that he should not be allowed to race. Having spent Friday night in hospital Mansell flew back to Europe on Saturday evening. Nelson Piquet was World Champion for the third time, his season-long consistency having paid dividends. The entry was much as it had been in Mexico although AGS decided to replace Pascal Fabre with Roberto Moreno. Gerhard Berger took pole position in his Ferrari ahead of Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren, Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton-Ford and Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari. Then came Piquet and Teo Fabi (Benetton) with the top 10 completed by Ayrton Senna (Lotus), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson&#x27;s McLaren and the second Brabham of Andrea de Cesaris. In the race Berger took the lead at the start and was never threatened, winning a dominant victory; this was Ferrari&#x27;s first victory since the 1985 German Grand Prix. Boutsen chased Berger early on but dropped behind Senna, Piquet and Johansson. Piquet&#x27;s race ended with an engine failure in the closing laps, so fourth place went to Alboreto with Boutsen fifth and Satoru Nakajima sixth.

===Race 16: Australia===
The last race of the year was at the demanding and punishing Adelaide street circuit in Australia. With Nigel Mansell out of action with injury after the Japanese GP, Williams did a deal with Brabham to use 1988 signing Riccardo Patrese for the final race of 1987 and Brabham took on youngster Stefano Modena as Patrese&#x27;s replacement. Otherwise the field was as before. Japanese GP winner Gerhard Berger was on pole position in his Ferrari from Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams-Honda and the Lotus-Honda of Ayrton Senna. Thierry Boutsen was fifth quickest in his Benetton-Ford ahead of Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari, Patrese&#x27;s Williams, Stefan Johansson&#x27;s McLaren, Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton and Andrea de Cesaris&#x27;s Brabham. Berger did as he had done in Japan, leading from flag to flag. He was chased initially by Piquet and Senna but the Lotus soon fell behind Prost. After the midrace pit stops Senna moved to second with Alboreto third. The final World Championship points went to Jonathan Palmer (Tyrrell) in fourth place and Roberto Moreno (AGS) in sixth. Yannick Dalmas (Larrousse Lola) finished fifth, but was not eligible for World Championship points as he was driving Larrousse-Lola&#x27;s second car and the team had officially entered only one car for the entire championship. Senna was then disqualified for a weight infringement in his last race for Lotus.

<text>Norman Island is an island at the southern tip of the British Virgin Islands archipelago. It is one of a number of islands reputed to be the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s pirate novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

== History ==
It is said that the island was named after a pirate who bought it or leased it at some point during the early 18th century, although supporting evidence for this contention is difficult to find.

However, Norman Island also has a documented history of pirate booty being stowed upon the island. In August 1750, a Spanish treasure galleon named &quot;Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot; sought shelter from a storm on the North Carolina coast. The crew mutinied and the treasure, said to consist of (amongst other things) 55 chests of silver coins, was loaded into two bilanders, one of which was carrying Owen Lloyd. The first vessel was lost, but Lloyd escaped to St. Croix. After disposing of some of the money, he proceeded to Norman Island where the treasure was buried. Lloyd and his crew were later arrested in St. Eustatius, but word of the treasure spread, and residents of Tortola went to Norman Island and dug it up for themselves. Part of the booty was later recovered by Gilbert Fleming, Lieutenant-General of the Leeward Islands at the time, who travelled to Tortola with two companies of soldiers. Fleming persuaded Abraham Chalwill, the acting Lieutenant Governor of the British Virgin Islands (who had coincidentally led the search for the treasure on Norman Island) to issue a proclamation whereby the treasure would be returned and the people who had dug it up would receive a one-third share as a reward.

There the historical record ends, but local rumours abound that a member of a well-known local family had been fishing near Norman Island and took shelter in one of the caves on the Western coast of Norman Island during a storm. The surge repeatedly banged his small boat against the walls of the cave, whilst the storm surge caused the water level to rise several feet. When the fortunate fisherman woke the next morning, a large number of rocks had broken off into his small craft, as had a small chest, supposedly filled with gold doubloons. The story cannot be verified as no legal application for treasure trove was ever made, but it is known that members of the family ceased being fisherman and left Tortola at about the time to open some shops in Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas.

Rumours persist of more pirate gold to be found on Norman Island, although to date no applications have ever been made for treasure trove.

== Today ==

The island is uninhabited and privately owned by Henry Jarecki. Its area is about , and it is about long. A large harbour known as the Bight offers one of the most protected anchorages in the area. It is one of the &quot;Little Sisters&quot;, along with Pelican Island, Peter Island, Salt Island, Dead Chest Island, and Ginger Island. This group of islands is smaller, lower, and more arid than other islands to the north and west.

Norman Island is a well-known destination for cruisers and other tourists because of three water-level caves at the base of cliffs just outside the western edge of the Bight. The caves are ideal for snorkelling, and, if one goes deeply enough into the cliffs, darkness makes the experience like a night dive.

The island has no permanent inhabitants (other than wild goats), but there are two restaurants on the island, Pirates Bight and The Club. Previously anchored in the Bight was a modern copy of an old schooner named the &quot;Willy T&quot;, which operated as a bar and restaurant. In September 2017, the Willy T was destroyed by Hurricane Irma. The owners of the Willy T had a new ship built and in May 2018 it was announced that the BVI government would not let the Willy T anchor on Norman Island, but would instead be able to anchor in Great Harbour on Peter Island. The Willy T has since returned to its original location on Norman Island. 

=== Cultural legacy ===
Some think that Norman Island and the tales about its treasures have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. The estimated timeframe of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; approximates to the time of the salvaging of the booty of the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot; on Norman Island. 

Norman Island has so many caves, hidden bays, and wrecks that many tourists still explore hoping to find treasure one day, and tourism operators in the British Virgin Islands have no interest in trying to discourage this.

=== Economic development ===

==== Joint Venture Agreement with the Henry Jarecki ====
On 22 November 2018, the BVI government, headed by Orlando Smith, entered into a Development Agreement with Audubon Holdings, owned by Henry Jarecki, to develop Norman Island as an environmentally conscious, luxury residential and tourist destination. 

Together with the island&#x27;s owner, the BVI government expects to establish a model for environmentally sustainable development. After planning and environmental approvals have met, the government hopes that the first phase of the project starts in the course of 2019.

<text>Cycling UK is a trading name of the Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club (CTC), which is a charitable membership organisation supporting cyclists and promoting bicycle use. Cycling UK is registered at Companies House as &quot;Cyclists’ Touring Club&quot;, and is covered by company law. It works at a national and local level to lobby for cyclists&#x27; needs and wants, provides services to members, and organises local groups for local activism and those interested in recreational cycling. The original Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club began in the nineteenth century with a focus on amateur road cycling but these days has a much broader sphere of interest encompassing everyday transport, commuting and many forms of recreational cycling. Prior to April 2016, the organisation operated under the brand &quot;CTC, the national cycling charity&quot;. , the organisation&#x27;s president is the newsreader Jon Snow.

==Present-day activities==
Cycling UK promotes Cycling in the United Kingdom, and had 68,431 members . Its objectives (registered with the Charity Commission) are to:

#&quot;Promote community participation in healthy recreation by promoting the amateur sport of cycling, cycle touring and associated amateur sports;
#&quot;Preserve and protect the health and safety of the public by encouraging and facilitating cycling and the safety of cyclists;
#&quot;Advance education by whatever means [Cycling UK&#x27;s] trustees think fit, including the provision of cycling, training and educational activities related to cycling;
#&quot;Promote the conservation and protection of the environment.&quot;

Cycling UK works to encourage more people to take up cycling, to make cycling safer and more enjoyable, and to provide cyclists with the support and resources they need. Its activities vary from road safety promotion to the provision of organised cycling holidays. Cycling UK does not focus on competitive cycle sport, since that has its own organisation, British Cycling.

Cycling UK&#x27;s successes have been a benchmarking project to spread best practice in cycle-friendly infrastructure design, and a grant of nearly £1 million to promote national standards for cycle training, standards Cycling UK helped to develop. In 2015, Cycling UK received funding of £1million for their social outreach project, the Big Bike Revival. The Big Bike Revival ran over the summer of 2015 and held over 1,600 events throughout England, benefiting over 50,000 people by &quot;reviving&quot; people&#x27;s old bikes and giving them the skills and confidence to cycle more. The project was awarded a further £500,000 by Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill in February 2016 to continue in summer 2016, and in June the Scottish Government awarded Cycling UK Scotland £450,000 to bring the Big Bike Revival to Scotland.

Cycling UK is organised at district level, with Local Groups organising cycle rides on Sundays and during the week. The more leisurely rides are planned around café stops, the quality of the ride often being judged on the standard of the cakes.

In 2008, the CTC Charitable Trust (formerly a part of the organisation charged with cycling development activities) launched the Cycle Champions programme. Using funding from the National Lottery&#x27;s Wellbeing Fund, CTC employed 13 Community Cycling development Officers around England to promote cycling in all sectors of the community, particularly those not traditionally associated with cycling. They recruited &#x27;Cycle Champions&#x27; within the community to work towards these goals as volunteers.

In 2009, CTC, in partnership with ContinYou and UK Youth, launched Bike Club, a programme funded by Cycling England with the intention of promoting cycling, and its associated learning experiences, among children and young people aged 10–20. Locally based officers advised on the establishment of clubs and the application for funding.

The members&#x27; magazine, &quot;Cycle&quot;, covers subjects including ride reports, product reviews and legal and technical advice. Members benefit from public liability insurance, which is extended to cover rides organised under the auspices of Cycling UK Local Groups.

Cycling UK is also the organisation behind the British Cycle Quest, an informal competition which challenges members to visit six designated places in each of the counties of England, Scotland and Wales.

Cycling UK is currently a member of the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation.

Cycling UK believes that UK cyclists should continue to be free to decide whether or not they wear cycle helmets, and campaigns to keep the UK&#x27;s laws as they are. Cycling UK says that this is because putting too much emphasis on cycle helmets makes people think that cycling is much more dangerous than it actually is, and can put people off. Cycling UK believes that health benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, so it is important that people are not discouraged. Cycling UK also feels that the real risks faced by cyclists, such as excessive vehicle speed, are often forgotten when all the discussions concentrate on cycle helmets. Cycling UK reviewed the current Highway Code before it was published, and helped reword some sections that could have been detrimental for cyclists.

Cycling UK is a founder of the Slower Speeds Initiative, an unincorporated association dedicated to reducing traffic speeds on all roads. CTC works with organisations such as Transport 2000 and Sustrans, and has charitable offshoots, the CTC Charitable Trust and the Cyclists&#x27; Defence Fund.

==History==

Cycling UK has been known by various names over the course of its history:
*The Bicycle Touring Club (1878–1883)
*The Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club (1883–2009, remains CTC&#x27;s legal name) The change from &quot;Bicycle&quot; to &quot;Cyclists&#x27;&quot; emphasised the fact that the club was also open to tricyclists - adult tricycles enjoyed considerable popularity at the time. 
*CTC, the national cyclists&#x27; organisation (2009–2012)
*CTC, the national cycling charity (2012–2016)
*Cycling UK (2016–)
2016&#x27;s branding change is intended to reflect the organisation&#x27;s current activities and avoid placing an undue emphasis on its historic touring focus.

===Foundation===
Cycling UK was founded at Harrogate, in Yorkshire, on 5 August 1878 by an Edinburgh medical student, Stanley Cotterell, under its original name of the Bicycle Touring Club. It claims to be the oldest transport organisation in the world. Its headquarters were wherever Cotterell happened to be living. It had 80 members, all men. The first woman, Jeanie A Welford, joined in 1880. In 1883, the Bicycle Touring Club was renamed the Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club to open membership to tricyclists. Membership rose to 10,627 and CTC opened a headquarters at 139-140 Fleet Street in London.

Members, like those of other clubs, often rode in uniform. CTC appointed an official tailor. The uniform was a dark green Devonshire serge jacket, knickerbockers and a &quot;Stanley helmet with a small peak&quot;. The colour changed to grey when green proved impractical because it showed the dirt. Groups often rode with a bugler at their head to sound changes of direction or to bring the group to a halt. Confusion could be caused when groups met and mistook each other&#x27;s signals.

===Roads improvement===
The CTC shared some interests with the Bicycle Union, founded in February 1878 and instigated by Gerard Cobb (a Cambridge University music tutor, president of the university&#x27;s bicycle club, and later also a member of the CTC&#x27;s national council). In July 1878, Cobb led the Bicycle Union&#x27;s lobbying of the Local Government Board, one of the official bodies managing British highways, and also actively campaigned for highway improvements in Cambridge. After the Bicycle Union was renamed the National Cyclists&#x27; Union (in 1883) it continued to campaign for highway improvements, successfully pursuing an 1885 legal action, with support from highway engineer Thomas Codrington, regarding the road between Birmingham and Halesowen. In October 1886, the CTC and NCU pooled resources and formed the Roads Improvement Association. This did not present itself as a cycling organisation, instead focusing on production of technical literature distributed to highways boards and surveyors to promote improved construction and maintenance methods. This changed at the start of the 20th century. In 1900, William Rees Jeffreys was elected to the CTC&#x27;s council; in 1901, he became the CTC&#x27;s RIA representative and later the same year became its honorary secretary. Jeffreys believed the RIA should focus more on political lobbying and push for a national highway authority and state funding of highways. In 1903, he was the first witness to give evidence to a British government inquiry into highway administration, and provided extensive RIA technical information on road surfaces sourced from cyclists, saying &quot;The bicycle is perhaps the best road inspector there is.&quot; He told the &quot;CTC Gazette&quot;: &quot;To no class in the community are good roads so important as to cyclists.&quot;

However, as many cyclists also became motorists, the RIA began to change its focus. The RIA&#x27;s 1901 AGM was held at the offices of the CTC, which also owned the RIA&#x27;s furniture; RIA council meetings comprised five representatives from each of the CTC and NCU and two or three from the Automobile Club of Great Britain. In 1903 Jeffreys became administrative secretary of the Automobile Club and secretary of the Motor Union of Great Britain and Ireland, which shared offices in London&#x27;s Albemarle Street with the RIA. Jeffreys &quot;became an arch motorist and the RIA morphed into a motoring organisation&quot;.

===Cycling accommodation===
From 1887, the Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club gave seals of approval, in the form of a cast iron plaque (later replaced by an enamel plate) showing the winged-wheel symbol of CTC, for mounting on an outside wall of hotels and restaurants which offered good accommodation and service to cyclists. A few of the metal signs still exist, as do a handful of road signs put up by CTC to warn cyclists of steep hills: usually steep going down, which was as much a problem for riders of large-wheel ordinaries, or &quot;penny-farthings&quot;, as going up. The CTC no longer puts up general road signs—although the right to do so is retained—and approved establishments are offered a plastic window-sticker carrying the blue and yellow logo shown above.

In 1898 CTC became embroiled in a court case to defend a member denied what she thought adequate service at a hotel carrying the club&#x27;s badge. Florence Wallace Pomeroy, Viscountess Harberton (1843–1911), of Cromwell Road, Kensington — wife of James, 6th Viscount Harberton, an Anglo-Irish peer, and president of the Western Rational Dress Society — cycled on the morning of 27 October 1898 to have lunch at the Hautboy Hotel in Ockham, Surrey. Lady Harberton&#x27;s campaigning for society to accept that women could wear &quot;rational&quot; dress on a bicycle and not ankle-length dresses led her to wear a jacket and a pair of long and baggy trousers which came together just above the ankle. She walked into the coffee room and asked to be served. The landlady, a Mrs Martha Sprague, showed her instead into the bar parlour. CTC went into action, mounting a prosecution for &quot;refusing food to a traveller&quot;. The landlady was acquitted and CTC lost the unusually large amount of money it had allotted to the case, which had been considered at the root of cyclists&#x27; rights and the values of CTC.

===Attempt to include motorists===
In 1906 CTC asked the High Court to amend its constitution so that it could admit all tourists, including car-drivers. A majority of members - 10,495 to 2,231 - had voted the previous year for the change to take place. The court ruled that CTC could not protect the interests of cyclists and drivers at the same time and denied permission.

===Delaying segregated cycle paths===
In 1926 the CTC discussed an unsuccessful motion calling for cycle tracks to be built on each side of roads for &quot;the exclusive use of cyclists&quot;, and that cyclists could be taxed, providing the revenue was used for the provision of such tracks.
The first (and one of the very few) dedicated roadside optional cycle tracks was built in 1934, as an experiment for the Ministry of Transport, located in London beside Western Avenue between Hanger Lane and Greenford Road. It was thought that &quot;the prospect of cycling in comfort as well as safety would be appreciated by most cyclists themselves&quot;. However, the idea ran into trenchant opposition from cycling groups, with the CTC distributing pamphlets warning against the threat of cycle paths.

Local CTC branches organised mass meetings to reject the use of cycle tracks and any suggestion that cyclists should be forced to use such devices. In 1935, a packed general meeting of the CTC adopted a motion rejecting ministerial plans for cycle path construction. The CTC were listened to, and the use of cycle tracks largely fell out of favour in the UK until the early 1970s.

In 1996 the UK Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club and the Institute of Highways and Transportation jointly produced a set of &quot;Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure&quot; guidelines that placed segregated cycling facilities at the bottom of the hierarchy of measures designed to promote cycling.

===Conversion to charity===

In September 2012, the Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club was merged with the CTC Charitable Trust, forming a single charitable organisation. This followed approval by The Charity Commission for England and Wales in June 2012. It was stated that conversion to a single unified charity would result in financial savings, allow the income of CTC to be boosted by up to £100,000 by reclaiming Gift Aid, and help to build public recognition and support. CTC members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of amending the CTC&#x27;s Memorandum and Articles to enable the registration as a unified charity, with almost 9,000 members voting at the AGM, and 92.7% voting in favour.

===Rebrand to Cycling UK===

In April 2016, CTC rebranded to Cycling UK, following a poll of members. However many of the district groups are still known as &quot;CTC&quot;.

<doc id="1139096" wikidata="Q201505" url="?curid=1139096" title="Cuban peso">
<text>The Cuban peso (in Spanish , ISO 4217 code: CUP) also known as , is the official currency of Cuba.

The Cuban peso historically circulated at par with the Spanish-American silver dollar from the 16th to 19th centuries, and then at par with the U.S. dollar from 1881 to 1959. The Castro government then introduced the socialist planned economy and pegged the peso to the Soviet ruble.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991 resulted in a Special Period of difficult economic adjustments for Cuba. From 1994 to 2020 the Cuban peso co-circulated with the Cuban convertible peso (ISO 4217 code &quot;CUC&quot;; colloquially pronounced &quot;kook&quot; in contrast to the CUP, often pronounced &quot;koop&quot;), which was convertible to and fixed against the U.S. dollar, and which was generally available to the public at a rate of US$1 = CUC 1 = CUP 25. State enterprises under the socialist planned economy, though, were entitled to exchange CUPs into CUCs and U.S. dollars at the official, subsidized rate of US$1 = CUC 1 = CUP 1, within prescribed limits.

From 1 January 2021, Cuba implemented the so-called &quot;Day Zero&quot; of monetary unification, which abolished the Cuban convertible peso as well as the 1 CUP/USD rate for state enterprises. Henceforth the Cuban Peso became the only legal tender in Cuba, CUCs were converted at the rate of 24 CUP/CUC, and a single official exchange rate of 24 CUP/USD became applicable for both public and private transactions. However, demand for hard currency made these exchange rates unavailable in the informal market.

==History==
=== Before 1994 ===
Before 1857, Spanish and Spanish colonial reales circulated in Cuba. From 1857, banknotes were issued specifically for use on Cuba. These were denominated in pesos, with each peso worth 8 reales. From 1869, decimal notes were also issued denominated in centavos, with 100 centavos for each peso. In 1881, the peso was pegged to the US dollar at par. The currency continued to be issued only in paper form until 1915, when the first coins were issued.

In 1960, the peso lost value after the United States imposed an embargo against Cuba and the suspended sugar quota. Fidel Castro then introduced the socialist planned economy to Cuba with the Soviet Union as its new economic partner, and the Cuban peso was pegged to the Soviet ruble at the same exchange rate as with the US dollar (i.e. at 4 old rubles before the 1961 monetary reform, and 0.9 SUR (90 kopeks of the new ruble) afterward).

Foreign exchange was a government monopoly under the socialist planned economy and could not be bought by the general public using Cuban pesos. Foreign currencies were therefore exchanged for coins of the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Turismo&quot; (INTUR) from 1981 to 1989 and for foreign exchange certificates of the &quot;Banco Nacional de Cuba&quot; from 1985. These coins or certificates were then used by visitors to buy some luxury goods not available for purchase in the national currency.

=== CUP and CUC, 1994-2020 ===


The Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991 resulted in a difficult Special Period of economic adjustments which required the acquisition of foreign exchange in order to pay for petroleum and other imported goods which used to be easily procured from Cuba&#x27;s former benefactor. In 1993, the U.S. dollar was made legal tender to encourage much-needed hard currency to enter the economy, and the Cuban peso lost much of its value with its free market exchange rate plunging to as low as 125 CUP/USD.

In 1994 the Cuban convertible peso (CUC) was introduced at par with the US dollar and circulated alongside it. Partial revival of economic confidence then stabilized the Cuban peso to 23-25 CUPs to the CUC or USD, leading to the eventual fixing of exchange rates to US$1 = CUC 1 = CUP 25, which was available to the public from 2004-2005 and then from 2011-2020 through &quot;Cadecas&quot; (&quot;Casas de Cambio&quot;, or &quot;Bureau de Change&quot;; an exchange rate of 1.08 USD/CUC applied from 2005-2011).

In 2004, the CUC replaced the U.S. dollar as a legal tender. The CUC was pegged to the dollar. From 2004 to 2020 a 10% penalty or tax was applied when changing U.S. dollars to CUCs, which can be avoided by exchanging other currencies in &quot;Cadecas&quot;.

The revival of economic stability after the Special Period from 2000, however, also made possible the revival of features of the socialist planned economy, which involved the distribution of subsidized goods to the public, supported by a system of artificially pegged exchange rates; for instance:
* State-owned businesses earned and spent foreign exchange at the artificial or subsidized &quot;official rate&quot; of US$1 = CUC 1 = CUP 1.
* In turn, this made possible the sales of rationed goods to the public who earned salaries in the order of CUP 500 a month (worth only US$20 at the cash exchange rate, but could buy as much as US$500 worth of imported rationed goods, should they be available).
* Furthermore, the government also set different exchange rates for different enterprises (e.g. 10 CUP/CUC for the Mariel Special Development Zone).
* Cuban state employees were paid with basic salaries in CUPs, plus performance-based bonuses in CUCs.

Among the effects of this complicated system of exchange rates and subsidies were as follows:
* State companies were dis-incentivized from earning foreign exchange, but the public was incentivized to spend on subsidized imported goods.
* The CUC did not really have a firm backing in convertible currencies, as it can be easily printed to pay state companies and employees. Hence, neither CUC nor CUP was traded internationally, and their import and export is prohibited, so neither could be bought in advance outside Cuba.
* The Cuban economy was described as &quot;dual-track&quot;, with the majority of citizens earning only CUPs and dependent on subsidized goods from ration stores, and with a minority earning much bigger salaries in CUCs and foreign exchange by catering to tourists.
* Shops and services were also &quot;dual-track&quot;, with rationed goods sold in CUPs, imported or non-essential goods in CUCs, and locations aimed at foreign tourists charging CUC prices much higher than CUP prices paid by Cubans. 
* The system where U.S. dollars were worth CUP 1, CUP 10 or CUP 25 created substantial rent-seeking arbitrage opportunities and incentives to game the system for illicit profits.

This complicated system of multi-track exchange rates and markets, and the inequalities and rent-seeking it spawned, had long been a source of frustration alike to government bureaucrats and to a disgruntled public. In October 2013, the government announced its intention to abolish this multiple exchange rate system and to phase out the CUC. While detailed preparations and new rules were underway, many businesses started to accept both CUPs and CUCs at the rate of CUC 1 = CUP 25, and higher-value banknotes of CUP 200, 500 and 1000 were introduced. Fears over its financial fallout on state companies, however, delayed the &quot;Day Zero&quot; implementation of monetary unification by several years, until the drying up of foreign exchange reserves in 2020 due to the absence of tourists during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns made the further sale of subsidized dollars and goods unaffordable to the state.

=== Monetary unification, 2021 ===
On 10 December 2020, it was announced that &quot;Day Zero&quot; of monetary unification would occur on 1 January 2021, with a single official exchange rate of 24 CUP/USD applying to state companies and private individuals alike, and with the Cuban Convertible Peso to be retired and exchanged at the rate of 24 CUP/CUC until the end of 2021.
While technically described as a devaluation from the official 1 CUP/USD used in government and state business books, for the public it was viewed as state enterprises merely catching up to the reality of 24 CUP/USD that had always existed in the private sector.
===Inflation===
During 2021, due to a shortage in foreign currency, it became difficult or impossible for private individuals and businesses to exchange CUP for hard currency at the official exchange rate of 24 CUP/USD. Demand for hard currency drove a black market in currency exchange, with US$1 being worth around 100 CUP by January 2022. The price of one U.S. dollar first reached 200 CUP in October 2022, and 300 CUP in February 2024.

==Coins==
=== Before 1959 ===
In 1897 and 1898, pesos were issued by revolutionary forces promoting independence. In 1915, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 5 centavos, silver 10, 20 and 40 centavos and 1 peso, and gold 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20 peso coins were introduced. These coins were designed by Charles E. Barber, who also designed the Barber dimes, quarters, half-dollars for the US. The coins were minted at the US mint at Philadelphia. The gold coins and 2 centavos were not produced after 1916, with the large star design 1 peso ceasing production in 1934. A new silver peso showing a woman, representing the Cuban Republic, beneath a star (the &quot;ABC peso&quot;) was issued from 1934 to 1939. Finally, a centennial of Jose Marti commemorative peso (also minted in 50, 25, and 1 centavos denominations) was produced in 1953.

Brass 1 and 5 centavos were issued in 1943, and with copper nickel composition sporadically from 1915 to 1958. Beginning in 1915, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 centavos coins were occasionally minted. The last 10, 20, and 40 centavo coins were produced in 1952; these were commemorative issues celebrating the fiftieth year of the republic. As mentioned above, in 1953, silver 25 and 50 centavos commemorative coins were also issued. These were the last silver coins issued for circulation. The last US produced coin was the 1961 five centavo piece.

=== After 1959 ===
In 1962, cupro-nickel 20 and 40 centavos were introduced, followed, in 1963, by aluminium 1 and 5 centavos. In 1969, aluminium 20 centavos were introduced, followed by aluminium 2 centavos and brass 1 peso in 1983. Cupro-nickel 3 peso coins were introduced in 1990, with brass-plated-steel 1 peso and nickel-clad-steel 3 peso coins following in 1992. 40 centavo coins were withdrawn from circulation around July 2004 and are no longer accepted as payment. In 2017, the Banco Central de Cuba introduced bi-metallic 5 pesos coin (the difference is the denomination and composition (with a cupronickel ring and a brass center plug). Coins currently in common circulation are 5 and 20 centavos and 1, 3 and 5 pesos; 1 and 2 centavo coins are rarely seen (due to their tiny value) but are still valid.

=== INTUR coins, 1981-1989 ===
Between 1988 and 1989, the National Institute of Tourism (, &quot;INTUR&quot;) issued &quot;Visitors&#x27; Coinage&quot; for use by tourists. In 1981, cupro-nickel 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and 1 peso were introduced, followed in 1988 by aluminium 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos. The INTUR coins were demonetized on October 15, 2001 and were replaced by convertible pesos (CUC).

=== CUC coins, 1994-2020 ===
The convertible peso was also divided into 100 centavos. In 1994, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos and 1 peso in nickel-plated steel. The rare bimetallic 5-peso coin was introduced in 1999, followed by the 1-centavo coin in 2000. These CUC coins co-circulated with CUP coins, with both types of coin distinguishable by differences in their color (mostly nickel-plated steel for CUCs, versus aluminum or brass for CUPs) as well as the octagonal shape visible in the outer round rim of all CUC coins.

==Banknotes==

=== Before 1959 ===
Under the Spanish Administration, the introduced Cuba&#x27;s first issue of banknotes in 1857 in denominations of 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1,000 dollars. The 25 peso denomination was introduced in 1867, and the 5 and 10 peso denominations in 1869. During the Ten Years&#x27; War, notes were issued dated 1869 in the name of the Republic of Cuba in denominations of 50 centavos, 1, 5, 10, 50, 500 and 1000 pesos.

In 1872, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavo, and 1 and 3 peso notes were introduced by the Banco Español de la Habana. In 1891, the Treasury issued notes for 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 pesos. In 1896, the name of the bank was changed to the , and it issued notes in denominations of 5 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 pesos, followed by 10 and 20 centavos in 1897.

In 1905, the &quot;National Bank of Cuba&quot; () issued notes for 1, 2, 5 and 50 pesos. However, the 1905 banknotes were not issued (source: Pick&#x27;s catalog) In 1934, the Government introduced silver certificates () in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pesos, followed by 100 pesos in 1936 and 500 and 1000 pesos in 1944.
===Silver certificates===
During the latter half of 1933, Cuba passed a series of laws to enact the production of Silver certificates (Certificado De Plata). Cuban silver certificates were designed, engraved, and printed by the US Treasury&#x27;s Bureau of Engraving and Printing from 1934 to 1949 and circulated in Cuba between 1935 and the early 1950s. The eight series of notes were dated 1934, 1936, 1936A, 1938, 1943, 1945, 1948, and 1949 and ranged from one peso to 100 pesos. A Cuban representative was on-site in Washington DC to consult and approve designs.

===Banco Nacional de Cuba (National Bank of Cuba)===
In 1949, the Banco Nacional de Cuba resumed paper money production, introducing notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 pesos that year, followed by notes in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 10,000 pesos in 1950. Denominations above 100 pesos were not continued.

With the introduction of a socialist planned economy, the Banco Nacional demonetised all previous banknotes on August 7, 1961, and replaced them with new banknotes that were printed in Czechoslovakia: the changeover was announced on August 4, and only residents in Cuba were allowed to exchange small amounts on August 6 and 7. The three-peso note was introduced in 1983.

===Banco Central de Cuba (Central Bank of Cuba)===
In 1997, the functions of Banco Nacional as a central bank, including issuing notes and coins, were transferred to a newly created entity, the Central Bank of Cuba. This is the Cuban centre of economics.

The 1961 bank notes were demonetized on May 1, 2002. 200, 500, and 1000 peso notes were (re-)introduced in 2015. Banknotes currently in circulation are 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 pesos. This banknote series is the only valid currency after the 2021 monetary unification when the convertible peso was retired.

=== Foreign Exchange Certificates, 1985 ===
In 1985, the Banco Nacional de Cuba issued foreign exchange certificates in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos (not equivalent to the CUP). After 1994 these were replaced by the CUC or the convertible peso.

=== CUC banknotes, 1994-2020 ===

From 1994 to 2020 the Banco Nacional de Cuba and Banco Central de Cuba issued CUC banknotes in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. These CUC banknotes co-circulated with CUP banknotes, but despite the huge 25:1 ratio in their values, they were distinguishable by the fact that CUC notes featured monuments, while CUP notes featured portraits.

<doc id="1139110" wikidata="Q1516955" url="?curid=1139110" title="History of the Royal Navy (after 1707)">
<text>The history of the Royal Navy reached an important juncture in 1707, when the Act of Union merged the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, following a century of personal union between the two countries. This had the effect of merging the Royal Scots Navy into the Royal Navy. The Navy grew considerably during the global struggle with France that had started in 1690 and culminated in the Napoleonic Wars, a time when the practice of fighting under sail was developed to its highest point. The ensuing century of general peace saw Britain virtually uncontested on the seas, and considerable technological development. Sail yielded to steam and cannon supplanted by large shell-firing guns, and ending with the race to construct bigger and better battleships. That race, however, was ultimately a dead end, as aircraft carriers and submarines came to the fore and, after the successes of World War II, the Royal Navy yielded its formerly preeminent place to the United States Navy. The Royal Navy has remained one of the world&#x27;s most capable navies and currently operates a fleet of modern ships, though the size of the fleet has declined significantly since the 1980s.

==A united navy and resurgent France 1707–1815==
=== Wars with France and Spain, 1707–1748 ===
From 1603 until their union in 1707, Scotland and England possessed separate navies that operated as one force – albeit for a period of Anglo-Scottish hostilities during the interregnum (1649–1660). Thomas Gordon became the last commander of the Royal Scots Navy, taking charge of HMS &quot;Royal Mary&quot; on the North Sea patrol, moving to &quot;Royal William&quot; when she entered service in 1705, and being promoted to commodore in 1706. With the Act of Union in 1707, the Royal Scottish Navy was merged with the English Royal Navy, but there were already much larger English ships called &quot;Royal William&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;, so the Scottish frigates were renamed and , while only retained its name.

The Act of Union took effect mid-way through the War of Spanish Succession, which saw the Navy operate in conjunction with the Dutch against the navies of France and Spain, in support of the efforts of Britain&#x27;s Austrian Habsburg allies to seize control of Spain and its Mediterranean dependencies from the Bourbons. Amphibious operations by the Anglo-Dutch fleet brought about the capture of Sardinia, the Balearic Islands and a number of Spanish mainland ports, most importantly Barcelona. While most of these gains were turned over to the Habsburgs, Britain held on to Gibraltar and Menorca, which were retained in the peace settlement, providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases. Early in the war French naval squadrons had done considerable damage to English and Dutch commercial convoys. However, a major victory over France and Spain at Vigo Bay (1702), further successes in battle, and the scuttling of the entire French Mediterranean fleet at Toulon in 1707 virtually cleared the Navy&#x27;s opponents from the seas for the latter part of the war. Naval operations also enabled the conquest of the French colonies in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Further conflict with Spain followed in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720), in which the Navy helped thwart a Spanish attempt to regain Sicily and Sardinia from Austria and Savoy, defeating a Spanish fleet at Cape Passaro (1718), and in an undeclared war in the 1720s, in which Spain tried to retake Gibraltar and Menorca.

The subsequent quarter-century of peace saw a few naval actions. The navy was used against Russia and Sweden in the Baltic from 1715 to 1727 to protect supplies of naval stores. It was used at Cape Passaro during the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1718, during the Great Northern War, and in the West Indies in 1726. Another war with Spain broke out in 1727, which saw the Royal Navy dispatch a fleet to resupply the British garrison in Gibraltar, which proved crucial in repelling a Spanish siege. In 1745, the Royal Navy contributed to collapse of the Jacobite rising.

After a period of relative peace, the Navy became engaged in the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (1739–1748) against Spain, which was dominated by a series of costly and mostly unsuccessful attacks on Spanish ports in the Caribbean, primarily a huge expedition against Cartagena de Indias in 1741. These led to heavy loss of life from tropical diseases. In 1742 the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was driven to withdraw from the war in the space of half an hour by the threat of a bombardment of its capital Naples by a small British squadron. The war became subsumed in the wider War of the Austrian Succession (1744–1748), once again pitting Britain against France. Naval fighting in this war, which for the first time included major operations in the Indian Ocean, was largely inconclusive, the most significant event being the failure of an attempted French invasion of England in 1744.

Total naval losses in the War of the Austrian Succession, including ships lost in storms and in shipwrecks were: France—20 ships-of-the-line, 16 frigates, 20 smaller ships, 2,185 merchantmen, 1,738 guns; Spain—17 ships-of-the-line, 7 frigates, 1,249 merchantmen, 1,276 guns; Britain—14 ships-of-the-line, 7 frigates, 28 smaller ships, 3,238 merchantmen, 1,012 guns. Personnel losses at sea were about 12,000 killed, wounded, or taken prisoner for France, 11,000 for Spain, and 7,000 for Britain.

===Seven Years&#x27; War, 1756–1763===

The subsequent Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) saw the Navy conduct amphibious campaigns leading to the conquest of New France, of French colonies in the Caribbean and West Africa, and of small islands off the French coast, while operations in the Indian Ocean contributed to the destruction of French power in India. Admiral John Byng failed to relieve Minorca; he was executed on his own quarterdeck. Voltaire famously wrote, in reference to Byng&#x27;s execution, that &quot;in this country it is wise to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others&quot; (admirals). (Today the French phrase &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot; used in English euphemistically connotes a threat by example.) Minorca was lost but subsequent operations went more successfully (due more to government support and better strategic thinking, rather than admirals &quot;encouraged&quot; by Byng&#x27;s example), and the British fleet won several victories, starting with the Battle of Cartagena in 1758.

The French tried to invade Britain in 1759 but their force was defeated at the Battle of Quiberon Bay off the coast of Brittany, fought in a gale on a dangerous lee shore. Once again the British fleet effectively eliminated the French Navy from the war, leading France to abandon major operations. Spain entered the war against Britain in 1762 but lost Havana and Manila, though the latter was given back in exchange for Florida. Britain was also able to seize the Spanish fleet that had been sheltering at Havana. The Treaty of Paris ended the war.

Naval losses of the Seven Years&#x27; War testify to the extent of the British victory. France lost 20 of her ships-of-the-line captured and 25 sunk, burned, destroyed, or lost in storms. The French navy also lost 25 frigates captured and 17 destroyed, and suffered casualties of 20,000 killed, drowned, or missing, as well as another 20,000 wounded or captured. Spain lost 12 ships-of-the-line captured or destroyed, 4 frigates, and 10,000 seamen killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Navy lost 2 ships-of-the-line captured, 17 sunk or destroyed by either battle or storm, 3 frigates captured and 14 sunk, but added 40 ships-of-the-line during the course of the war. British crews suffered 20,000 casualties, including POWs. Actual naval combat deaths for Britain were only 1,500, but the figure of 133,708 is given for those who died of sickness or deserted.

===American Revolutionary War, 1775–1783===

British America was a strategically significant location for the Royal Navy because it provided much of its timber supply. The Royal Navy also began to have a larger presence there during the American Revolution in order to suppress illegal smuggling to evade the Townshend Acts and the Navigation Acts. The &quot;Gaspee&quot; Affair in which a revenue cutter ran aground in Rhode Island and was attacked led colonial legislatures starting with the Virginia House of Burgesses to form committees of correspondence.

At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War (1775–83), the Royal Navy dealt with the fledgling Continental Navy handily, destroying or capturing many of its vessels. However, France soon took the American side, and in 1778 a French fleet sailed for America, where it attempted to land at Rhode Island and nearly engaged with the British fleet before a storm intervened, while back home another fought the British in the First Battle of Ushant. Spain and the Dutch Republic entered the war in 1780. Also the same year a large British convoy of 63 ships was captured by a Franco-Spanish fleet, which dealt a severe blow to the commerce of Great Britain. Action shifted to the Caribbean, where there were a number of battles with varying results. A Spanish fleet was defeated at the battle of Cape Saint Vincent in 1780 while a Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. The most important operation came in 1781 when, in the Battle of the Chesapeake, the British failed to lift the French blockade of Lord Cornwallis, resulting in a British surrender in the Battle of Yorktown. Although combat was over in North America, it continued in the Caribbean and India, where the British experienced both successes and failures. Though Minorca had been recaptured, it was returned to the Spanish. The relief of Gibraltar later the same year symbolised the restoration of British naval ascendancy, but this came too late to prevent the independence of the Thirteen Colonies.

The eradication of scurvy from the Royal Navy in the 1790s came about due to the efforts of Gilbert Blane, chairman of the Navy&#x27;s Sick and Hurt Board, which ordered fresh lemon juice to be given to sailors on ships. Other navies soon adopted this successful solution.

===French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793–1815)===


The French Revolutionary Wars of 1793–1802 and the Napoleonic Wars of 1803–15 saw the Royal Navy reach a peak of efficiency, dominating the navies of all Britain&#x27;s adversaries. Initially Britain did not involve itself in the French Revolution, but in 1793 France declared war, leading to the Glorious First of June battle in the following year off Brest, followed by the capture of French colonies in the Caribbean. The Dutch Republic declared war in 1795 and Spain in 1796, on the side of France. Further action came in 1797 and 1798, with the Battle of Cape St Vincent and the Battle of the Nile (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay), which brought Admiral Horatio Nelson to the public&#x27;s attention. The latter engagement cut off Napoleon&#x27;s expedition to Egypt, though French forces remained in control of that country for three more years. In 1800, Russia, Sweden and Denmark–Norway agreed to resist British warships searching neutral shipping for French goods and in 1801 the Danes closed their ports to British shipping. This caused Britain to attack ships and the fort at the Battle of Copenhagen.

The Peace of Amiens in 1802 proved to be but a brief interruption in the years of warfare, and the Navy was soon blockading Napoleon&#x27;s France. In 1805 French invasion forces were massed on the French coast with 2,300 vessels. The French fleet at Toulon went to the West Indies where it was intended to meet the Spanish one but it was chased by the British fleet and returned without meeting up. After fighting an action off Finisterre the French fleet withdrew to Cadiz where it met up with the Spanish one. The height of the Navy&#x27;s achievements came on 21 October 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar where a numerically smaller but more experienced British fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Nelson decisively defeated the combined French and Spanish fleet. The victory at Trafalgar consolidated the United Kingdom&#x27;s advantage over other European maritime powers, but Nelson was killed during the battle.

By concentrating its military resources in the navy, Britain could both defend itself and project its power across the oceans as well as threaten rivals&#x27; ocean trading routes. Britain therefore needed to maintain only a relatively small, highly mobile, professional army that sailed to where it was needed, and was supported by the navy with bombardment, movement, supplies and reinforcement. The Navy could cut off enemies&#x27; sea-borne supplies, as with Napoleon&#x27;s army in Egypt.

Theoretically, the highest commands of the Royal Navy were open to all within its ranks showing talent. In practice, family connections, political or professional patronage were very important for promotion to ranks higher than commander. British captains were responsible for recruiting their ship&#x27;s crew from a combination of volunteers, impressment and the requisitioning of existing crew members from ships in ordinary. From 1795 a Quota System was also applied, where each British county was required to supply a certain number of volunteers. Many nationalities served on British ships, with foreigners comprising fifteen per cent of crews by the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Americans were the most common foreign nationality in naval service, followed by Dutch, Scandinavian and Italian. While most foreigners in the Navy were obtained through impressment or from prison ships, around 200 captured French sailors were also persuaded to join after their fleet was defeated at the Battle of the Nile.

The conditions of service for ordinary seamen, while poor by modern standards, were better than many other kinds of work at the time. However, inflation during the late 18th century eroded the real value of seamen&#x27;s pay while, at the same time, the war caused an increase in pay for merchant ships. Naval pay also often ran years in arrears, and shore leave decreased as ships needed to spend less time in port with better provisioning and health care, and copper bottoms (which delayed fouling). Discontent over these issues eventually resulted in serious mutinies in 1797 when the crews of the Spithead and Nore fleets refused to obey their officers and some captains were sent ashore. This resulted in the short-lived &quot;Floating Republic&quot; which at Spithead was quelled by promising improvements in conditions, but at the Nore resulted in the hanging of 29 mutineers. It is worth noting that neither of the mutinies included flogging or impressment in their list of grievances and, in fact, the mutineers themselves continued the practice of flogging to preserve discipline.

Napoleon acted to counter Britain&#x27;s maritime supremacy and economic power, closing European ports to British trade through the Continental System. He also authorised many privateers, operating from French territories in the West Indies, placing great pressure on British mercantile shipping in the Western Hemisphere. The Royal Navy was too hard-pressed in European waters to release significant forces to combat the privateers, and its large ships of the line were not very effective at seeking out and running down fast and manoeuvrable privateers which operated as widely spread single ships or small groups. The Royal Navy reacted by commissioning small warships of traditional Bermuda design. The first three ordered from Bermudian builders—HMS &quot;Dasher&quot;, HMS &quot;Driver&quot; and HMS &quot;Hunter&quot;—were sloops of 200 tons, armed with twelve 24-pounder guns. A great many more ships of this type were ordered, or bought from trade, primarily for use as couriers. The most notable was , the former Bermudian merchantman that carried news of victory back from Trafalgar. At the end of the war the manning levels of the Royal Navy decreased sharply from 145,000 to 19,000.

Although brief in retrospect, the years of the Napoleonic wars came to be remembered as the apotheosis of &quot;fighting sail&quot;, and stories of the Royal Navy at this period have been told and retold regularly since then, most famously in the Horatio Hornblower series of C. S. Forrester.

===War of 1812===
In the years following the battle of Trafalgar there was increasing tension at sea between Britain and the United States. American traders took advantage of their country&#x27;s neutrality to trade with both the French-controlled parts of Europe, and Britain. Both France and Britain tried to prevent each other&#x27;s trade, but only the Royal Navy was in a position to enforce a blockade. Another irritant was the suspected presence of British deserters aboard US merchant and naval vessels. Royal Navy ships often attempted to recover these deserters. In one notorious instance in 1807, otherwise known as the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair, fired on causing significant casualties before boarding and seizing suspected British deserters.

In 1812, while the Napoleonic wars continued, the United States declared war on Great Britain and tried to invade Canada. Occupied by its struggle with France, British policy was to commit only sufficient forces to the American War of 1812 to prevent American victory. On land, this meant a great reliance on militia and Native American allies. On the water, the Royal Navy kept its large men-of-war in Europe, relying on smaller vessels to counter the weak United States Navy. Some of the action consisted of small-scale engagements on the Great Lakes.
At sea, the War of 1812 was characterised by single-ship actions between small ships, and disruption of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy struggled to build as many ships as it could, generally sacrificing on the size and armament of vessels, and struggled harder to find adequate personnel, trained or barely trained, to crew them. Many of the men crewing Royal Naval vessels were rated only as &quot;landsmen&quot;, and many of those rated as &quot;seamen&quot; were impressed (conscripted), with resultingly poor morale. The US Navy could not begin to equal the Royal Navy in number of vessels, and had concentrated in building a handful of better-designed frigates. These were larger, heavier and better-armed (both in terms of number of guns, and in the range to which the guns could fire) than their British counterparts, and were handled by larger volunteer crews (where the Royal Navy was hindered by a relative shortage of trained seamen, the US Navy was not large enough to make full use of the large number of American merchant seamen put out of work, even before the war, by the Embargo Act). As a result of the American frigates being larger some British ships were defeated and, midway through the war, the Admiralty issued the order not to engage American frigates individually.

The most important aspect of the Royal Navy&#x27;s involvement of The war of 1812 was the blockade it enforced on America and American shipping. Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict. In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah and New York City was well. However, as additional ships were sent to North America in 1813, the Royal Navy was able to tighten the blockade and extend it, first to the coast south of Narragansett by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814. In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon, and the end of the supply problems with Wellington&#x27;s army, New England was blockaded. The blockade was so significant to British victory at sea that it confined most merchant and naval vessels to port. The American frigates and ended the war blockaded and hulked in New London, Connecticut. USS &quot;United States&quot; and USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; attempted to set sail to raid British shipping in the Caribbean, but were forced to turn back when confronted with a British squadron, and by the end of the war, the United States had six frigates and four ships-of-the-line sitting in port.

The blockade resulted in American exports decreasing from $130 million in 1807 to $7 million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies. The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates. The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads. In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.

Despite successful American claims for damage having been pressed in British courts against British privateers several years before, the War was probably the last occasion on which the Royal Navy made considerable reliance on privateers to boost Britain&#x27;s maritime power. In Bermuda, privateering had thrived until the build-up of the regular Royal Naval establishment, which began in 1795, reduced the Admiralty&#x27;s reliance on privateers in the Western Atlantic. During the American War of 1812, however, Bermudian privateers alone captured 298 enemy ships (the total captures by all British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies was 1,593 vessels.)

By this time, the Royal Navy was building a naval base and dockyard in Bermuda. It had begun buying land, mostly at the West End of Bermuda, notably Ireland Island, following American independence, permanently establishing itself in the colony in 1795. The development of the intended site was delayed by a dozen years as a suitable passage through the surrounding reefline needed to be located. Until then, the Royal Navy operated from the old capital in the East End, St. George&#x27;s. Bermuda replaced Newfoundland initially as the winter base of the North America and West Indies Squadron, and then as its year-round headquarters, naval station, and dockyard, with its Admiralty House at Mount Wyndham, in Bailey&#x27;s Bay, and then at Spanish Point, opposite Ireland Island on the mouth of Great Sound.

Located off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, South of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and North-East of Miami, Bermuda replaced the continental bases between Canada and the West Indies that the Royal Navy had been deprived of by American independence. During the War of 1812 the Royal Navy&#x27;s blockade of the US Atlantic ports was coordinated from Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The blockade kept most of the American navy trapped in port. The Royal Navy also occupied coastal islands, encouraging American slaves to defect. Military-aged males were enlisted into a Corps of Colonial Marines while their families were sent to the dockyard in Bermuda for the duration of the war, employed by the Royal Navy. These marines fought for the Crown on the Atlantic Seaboard, and in the attack on Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake.

After British victory in the Peninsular War, part of Wellington&#x27;s Light Division was released for service in North America. This 2,500-man force, composed of detachments from the 4, 21, 44, and 85 Regiments with some elements of artillery and sappers and commanded by Major-General Robert Ross, arrived in Bermuda in 1814 aboard a fleet composed of the 74-gun , three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. The combined force was to launch raids on the coastlines of Maryland and Virginia, with the aim of drawing US forces away from the Canada–US border. In response to American actions at Lake Erie (the Burning of York), however, Sir George Prevost requested a punitive expedition which would &quot;deter the enemy from a repetition of such outrages&quot;. The British force arrived at the Patuxent on 17 August and landed the soldiers within 36 miles of Washington, D.C. Led by Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, the British force drove the US government out of Washington, D.C.. Ross shied from the idea of burning the public buildings in the city, but Cockburn and others set it alight. Buildings burned included the US Capitol and the US President&#x27;s Mansion.

== Pax Britannica, 1815–1914 ==

After 1827 there were no major battles until 1914. The navy was used against shore installations, such as those in the Baltic and Black Sea during the Crimean War in 1854 and 1855. They were also used to fight pirates; to hunt down slave ships; and to assist the army when sailors and marines were landed as naval brigades, as on many occasions between the siege of Sevastopol and the 1900 Boxer Rebellion. With a fleet larger than any two rivals combined, the British nation could take security for granted, but at all times the national leaders and public opinion supported a powerful navy, and service was of high prestige.

=== Operations ===

The first action of the period was the 1816 bombardment of Algiers by a joint Anglo-Dutch fleet under Lord Exmouth, to force the Barbary state of Algiers to free Christian slaves and to halt the practice of enslaving Europeans. During the Greek War of Independence, at the Battle of Navarino in 1827, the Turkish fleet was destroyed by the combined fleets of Britain, France and Russia. This was the last major action between fleets of sailing ships. Ottoman involvement continued, with the bombardment of Acre in 1840, and additional Mediterranean crises during the rest of the decade.

To try to prevent Russia gaining access to a warm water port, the Crimean War was fought in the 1850s. Britain (in concert with the Ottoman Empire and the Second French Empire) sent 150 transports and 13 warships and the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet was destroyed. The Crimean War was a testing ground for the new technologies of steam and shell. It was shown that explosive shells ripped wooden hulls to pieces, which led to the development of the &quot;iron clad&quot; ship. It also showed the need for a permanent pool of trained seamen. There were two Anglo-French campaigns against Russia. In the Black Sea, success at Sevastopol was paralleled by successful operations in the Baltic including the bombardments of Bomarsund and Sveaborg.

The Chinese government placed unilateral restraints on British trade with China. Acting under the Daoguang Emperor, 1839 the Chinese official Lin Zexu impounded opium from India, but the British insisted on the British Empire being allowed to export to China and instituted a blockade of Guangzhou, beginning the First Opium War. There was a Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860. In 1857, the British captured Canton and threatened Beijing. They were thrown back by the Chinese in 1859 but succeeded the following year. As a result of these actions Britain gained a base at Hong Kong in 1839 and a base in Canton in 1857.

In 1864, the bombardment of Kagoshima forced Japan to accept foreign traders. During the Russo-Turkish War the British sent a fleet of battleships under Admiral Geoffrey Hornby to intimidate Russia from entering Constantinople. Over the next thirty years, only a bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 brought the fleet into action, carried out to ensure control of the Suez Canal.

=== Technology ===
During this period, naval warfare underwent a comprehensive transformation, brought about by steam propulsion, metal ship construction, and explosive munitions. These changes marked the end of the age of sail and construction techniques that had dominated the preceding century. Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the Industrial Revolution, the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.

Steam power was of interest to the Royal Navy from the beginning of the 19th century, since it neatly solved the difficult and dangerous sailing problems encountered in estuaries and other inshore areas. It was first adopted in , launched in 1822, and in 1824 accompanied the expedition to Algiers. Steam vessels appeared in greater numbers through the 1830s and 1840s, all using side-mounted paddlewheels; screw propellers were introduced in the 1830s and, after some reluctance, were adopted in the mid-1840s (the famous tug-of-war between the screw-propelled HMS &quot;Rattler&quot; and the paddlewheeled was entertaining, but records show the Admiralty had already decided on and ordered screw ships). The first major steam warship was . In the 1850s Naval Arms Race screw battleships and frigates, both conversions and new constructions, were built in large numbers. These ships retained a full capacity for sail as steam engines were not yet efficient enough to permit long ocean voyages under power. Steam power was intended only for use during battle and to allow ships to go to sea at will instead of being held in port by adverse winds. A triple expansion steam engine was introduced in 1881 which was more efficient than earlier ones. These changes were followed by the steam turbine, invented by Charles Parsons, demonstrated by the Turbinia in 1899.

Iron in ship construction was first used for diagonal-cross-bracing in major warships. The adoption of iron hulls for ocean-going ships had to wait until after Admiralty experiments had solved the problem of an iron-hull&#x27;s effect on compass deviation. Because iron hulls were much thinner than wooden hulls, they appeared to be more vulnerable to damage when ships ran aground. Although Brunel had adopted iron in the , the Admiralty was also concerned about the vulnerability of iron in combat, and experiments with iron in the 1840s seemed to indicate that iron would shatter under impact.

In 1858 France built the first seagoing ironclad, &quot;Gloire&quot;, and Britain responded with of 1860, the first of the 1860s Naval Arms Race—an intensive programme of construction that eclipsed French efforts by 1870. She was called a &quot;Black Snake&quot; by Napoleon III, but was soon superseded.

When armoured ships were first introduced, in-service guns had very little ability to penetrate their armour. However, starting in 1867, guns started to be introduced into service capable of penetrating the armour of the first generation iron-clads, albeit at favourable angles and at short range. This had already been anticipated, and armour thicknesses grew, resulting in turn in a gun &quot;calibre-race&quot; as larger guns gave better penetration. The explosive shell was introduced in 1820.

In parallel with this there was a debate over how guns should be mounted on ship. Captain Cowper Coles had developed a gun turret design in the late 1850s as a result of experience in the Crimean War. Initial designs, published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1859 were for a ship with far more than 10 turrets. Consequently, a range of coastal-service turret-ships were built in parallel with the seagoing iron-clads. Because of agitation from Coles and his supporters, the issue of turret-ships became deeply political, and resulted in the ordering of an unsatisfactory private design by Lairds and Coles. The rival Admiralty design, , had a long and successful career. However the need to combine high-free-board at the bow with sails meant that both these ships had very poor end-on fire. The Admiralty&#x27;s next seagoing mastless turret-ship design solved these problems by having very large coal bunkers, and put the 35-ton guns in turrets on a breastwork.

Tank testing of hull models was introduced and mechanical calculators as range finders. The torpedo came in during the 1870s and the first ship to fire one in battle was . This led to the development of torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers (later called just destroyers).

===Palmerston Forts, 1860–1869===

During the 1860s, fear of a French invasion of Britain prompted a major programme of coastal fortifications. Over 70 forts were constructed by the end of the decade, many of which were in the vicinity of the naval base in Portsmouth and the surrounding waters. The mid 19th century saw such rapid technological development that some, such as Fort Brockhurst, were obsolete before construction had even finished. France was crippled by defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war and Britain would not face a serious military threat until the World Wars, by which point they were long out of date. They received much ridicule in later years, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Follies&quot;.

===Two-power standard===
The age of naval dominance at low cost was ended by increased naval competition from old rivals, such as France and Russia. These challenges were reflected by the Naval Defence Act 1889, which received royal assent on 31 May 1889, to increase British naval strength and formally adopt the country&#x27;s &quot;two-power standard&quot;. The standard called for the Royal Navy to be as strong as the world&#x27;s next two largest navies combined (at that point, France and Russia) by maintaining a number of battleships at least equal to their combined strength.

That led to a new ship building programme, which authorised ten new battleships, 38 cruisers, and additional vessels. The books by American Alfred Thayer Mahan and his visit to Europe in the 1890s heightened interest even more. When Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone held out against another large programme of naval construction in 1894, he found himself alone, and so resigned.
At this time, 80% of merchant steamships were built in British shipyards. The rate of French construction was low, and construction times were stretched out. For instance, the last of the three French &quot;1872-programme&quot; battleships was not completed until October 1886. Many of these long-delayed ships were completed in the second half of the 1880s, and this was misrepresented as the French having more new battleships than the Royal Navy in various publications including the famous 1884 articles in the Liberal magazine &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which alarmed the public just before the General Election, and helped create an increased market for books on naval matters such as the &quot;Naval Annual&quot;, which was first published in 1887. Reforms were also gradually introduced in the conditions for enlisted men with the abolition of military flogging in 1879, amongst others.

The two-power standard was abandoned before the First World War, and after the war it was replaced by a &quot;one-power standard&quot;, with the navy kept equal in size to the United States Navy.

===Reforms and increasing tension, 1901–1914===

Both naval construction and naval strategising became intense, prompted by the development of torpedoes and submarines (from 1901), which challenged traditional ideas about the power of battleships. At the same time the committed to the &quot;big gun only&quot; concept and caused a shift in thinking around the world. This ship had ten 12-inch guns with a top speed of 21.5 knots, a speed and firepower that rendered all existing battleships obsolete. The industrial and economic development of Germany had by this time overtaken Britain, enabling the Imperial German Navy to attempt to outpace British construction of dreadnoughts. In the ensuing arms race, Britain succeeded in maintaining a substantial numerical advantage over Germany, but for the first time since 1805 another navy now existed with the capacity to challenge the Royal Navy in battle.

The British were aided in this development by having naval observers aboard the Japanese fleet at the battle of Tsushima straits in 1905 where the Japanese decisively defeated the Russian fleet. Another innovative concept was the battlecruiser, as well armed as a battleship but faster. However, to achieve this the ship&#x27;s armour was less compared to a battleship. The result was a potentially fatal weakness when fighting other capital ships.

The Royal Navy began developing submarines beginning on 4 February 1901. These submarines were ordered in late 1900 and were built by Vickers under a licensing agreement with the American Electric Boat Company. The first British Holland No. 1 (Type 7) submarine (assembled by Vickers) was 63 feet 4 inches long.

Major reforms of the British fleet were undertaken, particularly by Admiral Jackie Fisher as First Sea Lord from 1904 to 1909. During this period, 154 obsolete ships, including 17 battleships, were scrapped to make way for newer vessels. Reforms in training and gunnery were introduced to make good perceived deficiencies, which in part Tirpitz had counted upon to provide his ships with a margin of superiority. Changes in British foreign policy, such as the Great Rapprochement with the United States, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the Entente Cordiale with France allowed the fleet to be concentrated in home waters. By 1906 the Royal Navy&#x27;s only likely opponent was the Imperial German Navy.

In 1910, the Naval Intelligence Department (NID) was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.

Some countries from within the British Empire started developing their own navies. In 1910 the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy came into being; local defence forces that would however operate within an overall imperial strategy led by the RN. All these reforms and innovations of course required a large increase in funding. Between 1900 and 1913 the Naval Estimates nearly doubled to total £44,000,000.

==First World War, 1914–1918==
The accumulated tensions in international relations finally broke out into the hostilities of World War I. From the naval point of view, it was time for the massed fleets to prove themselves, but caution and manoeuvring resulted in few major engagements at sea. Although there was no decisive battle, the Royal Navy and the Kaiserliche Marine fought many small engagements: the Battle of Heligoland Bight, the Battle of Coronel, the Battle of the Falkland Islands, and the Battle of Dogger Bank. The one great confrontation came in 1916 with the Battle of Jutland. The British blockade and cut-off from international trade led to increasing public discontent and finally the German Revolution of 1918–19. The British fighting advantage proved insurmountable, leading the High Seas Fleet to abandon any attempt to challenge British dominance.

===Blockade of Germany===

The majority of the Royal Navy&#x27;s strength was deployed at home in the Grand Fleet, in an effort to blockade Germany and to draw the Hochseeflotte (the German &quot;High Seas Fleet&quot;) into an engagement where a decisive victory could be gained. The Navy&#x27;s Northern Patrol and a mining program closed off access to the North Sea, while the Dover Patrol closed off access to the English Channel. As well as closing off the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from Germany. The blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the Treaty of Versailles.

===Defending merchant shipping===

The most serious menace faced by the Navy came from the attacks on merchant shipping mounted by German U-boats. For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by prize rules requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915 the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight but later returned to the previous rules of engagement to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy&#x27;s response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a convoy system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troopships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.

Energy was a critical factor for the British war effort. Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain. Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. In 1917 total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85% was supplied by the United States, and 6% by Mexico. Fuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917 the Royal Navy consumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, using their oil wells in Qajar Iran. The need for oil would also lead to the British colonisation of Iraq under a League of Nations mandate during the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the war.

===Other campaigns===
At the start of the war the German Empire had armed cruisers scattered across the globe. The Royal Navy, along with the Royal Australian Navy, captured German colonies in the Pacific shortly after the outbreak of the war. This forced the German East Asia Squadron to abandon their base. With the wayward squadron now intending to attack shipping in the region, a small number of Royal Navy ships attempted to engage them at the Battle of Coronel, which resulted in significant British losses. The German East Asia Squadron was eventually defeated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914.

The Royal Navy was also heavily committed in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. It suffered heavy losses during a failed attempt to break through the system of minefields and shore batteries defending the straits.

The Navy contributed the Royal Naval Division to the land forces of the New Army. The Royal Marines took part in many operations including the raid on Zeebrugge.

The Royal Naval Air Service was formed in 1914 but was mainly limited to reconnaissance. Converted ships were initially used to launch aircraft with landings in the sea. The first purpose-built aircraft carrier was HMS &quot;Argus&quot;, launched in 1918.

==Inter-war period, 1918–1939==
In 1921 the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy were established as New Zealand force within the RN.

===Disarmament and pay cuts, 1922–1935===
In the wake of the First World War, there was an international movement to begin disarmament. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed limits on individual ship tonnage and gun calibre, as well as total tonnage of the navy. The treaty, together with the deplorable financial conditions during the immediate post-war period and the Great Depression, forced the Admiralty to scrap all capital ships with a gun calibre under 13.5 inches and to cancel plans for new construction. Three of the s had already been cancelled by the time the treaty was signed. The of 16-inch battlecruisers and the of 18-inch battleships were cancelled. Also under the treaty, three &quot;large light cruisers&quot;—, and —were converted to aircraft carriers. New additions to the fleet were therefore minimal during the 1920s, the only major new vessels being two s and fifteen s and heavy cruisers. This was followed by the 1930 London Naval Treaty which deferred new capital ship construction until 1937 and reiterated construction limits on cruisers, destroyers and submarines.

There were significant pay cuts in the 1920s, amounting to 25% for some. This culminated in the Invergordon Mutiny of 1931, with crews of various warships refused to sail on exercises, which caused great shock. This led to changes with the pay cuts reduced to 10%, though around 200 sailors were jailed in the aftermath.

===One-power standard===
Faced with the expansion of the United States Navy, by 1922 the British navy adopted the &quot;one-power standard&quot;, which saw the Royal Navy required to match the United States Navy in size. This change has sometimes been connected with the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, however this is incorrect as the treaty limited maximum fleet scale, not minimum fleet scale. British naval supremacy was lost in 1943, when the United States Navy overtook the Royal Navy in size amid the Second World War.

===Tensions and arms race, 1937–1939===

As international tensions increased in the mid-1930s the Second London Naval Treaty of 1935 failed to halt the development of a naval arms race and by 1938 treaty limits were effectively ignored. The re-armament of the Royal Navy was well under way by this point, with construction underway on the still treaty-affected new battleships and its first full-sized purpose-built aircraft carriers. In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships, battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as ASDIC, Huff-Duff and hydrophones, were developed. The Navy had lost control of naval aviation when the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, but regained control of ship-board aircraft with the return of the Fleet Air Arm to Naval control in 1937.

The Navy made a show of force against Mussolini&#x27;s war in Abyssinia, and operated in China to evacuate British citizens from cities under Japanese attack during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

==Second World War, 1939–1945==


At the start of the war in 1939, the Royal Navy was the largest in the world, with over 1,400 vessels.
* 7 aircraft carriers – with 5 more under construction
* 15 battleships and battlecruisers – with 5 more under construction
* 66 cruisers – with 23 more under construction
* 184 destroyers – with 52 under construction
* 45 escort and patrol vessels – with 9 under construction and one on order
* 60 submarines – with 9 under construction

The Royal Navy suffered heavy losses in the first two years of the war, including the carriers HMS &quot;Courageous&quot;, &quot;Glorious&quot; and , the battleships and and the battlecruiser in the European Theatre, and the carrier , the battleship , the battlecruiser and the heavy cruisers , and in the Asian Theatre. Of the 1,418 men on the &quot;Hood&quot;, only three survived its sinking. Over 3,000 people were lost when the converted troopship was sunk in June 1940, the greatest maritime disaster in Britain&#x27;s history. There were however also successes against enemy surface ships, as in the battles of the River Plate in 1939, Narvik in 1940 and Cape Matapan in 1941, and the sinking of the German capital ships in 1941 and in 1943.

The defence of the ports and harbours and keeping sea-lanes around the coast open was the responsibility of Coastal Forces and the Royal Naval Patrol Service.

===Battle of the Atlantic, 1939–1945===

The Navy&#x27;s most critical struggle was the Battle of the Atlantic defending Britain&#x27;s vital commercial supply lines against U-boat attack. A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by &quot;wolf-packs&quot;, were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of escort carriers, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German Enigma signals by the code-breakers of Bletchley Park. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in the Arctic, where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on Convoys to Malta.

===Operation Dynamo, 1940===

During one of the earliest phases of the War the Royal Navy provided critical cover during Operation Dynamo, the British evacuations from Dunkirk, and as the ultimate deterrent to a German invasion of Britain during the following four months. At Taranto, Admiral Cunningham commanded a fleet that launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history. Cunningham was determined that the Navy be perceived as the United Kingdom&#x27;s most daring military force: when warned of risks to his vessels during the Allied evacuation after the Battle of Crete he said, &quot;It takes the Navy three years to build a new ship. It will take three hundred years to build a new tradition. The evacuation will continue.&quot;

===Amphibious operations===

Naval supremacy was vital to the amphibious operations carried out, such as the invasions of Northwest Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Normandy. The use of the Mulberry harbours allowed the invasion forces to be kept resupplied. The successful invasion of Europe reduced the European role of the navy to escorting convoys and providing fire support for troops near the coast as at Walcheren, during the battle of the Scheldt.

===Operations against Japan===
The British Eastern Fleet had been withdrawn to East Africa because of Japanese incursions into the Indian Ocean. Despite opposition from the U.S. Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Ernest King, the Royal Navy sent a large task force to the Pacific (British Pacific Fleet). This required the use of wholly different techniques, requiring a substantial fleet support train, resupply at sea and an emphasis on naval air power and defence. Their largest attack was as part of Operation Meridian, striking oil refineries in Sumatra to deny Japanese access to supplies. The fleet supported allied forces during the Battle of Okinawa.

Had Japan not surrendered, the Royal Navy would have been part of Operation Downfall in 1946. The planned invasion and occupation of Kyushu would have been the largest amphibious landing ever conducted. The Royal Navy would have committed 18 aircraft carriers and 4 battleships to the action.

===End of the war, and loss of naval supremacy===
By the end of the war the Royal Navy comprised over 4,800 ships. However, it had lost its position as the largest or equal largest navy in the world to the United States Navy in 1943. The Royal Navy had become the second-largest fleet in the world, losing a supremacy that had been maintained for over a century.

== Cold War era, 1945–1991 ==
After the Second World War, the decline of the British Empire and the economic hardships in Britain forced the reduction in the size and capability of the Royal Navy. All of the pre-war ships (except for the Town-class light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945–48, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain&#x27;s commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian Paul Kennedy called the Upward Spiral.

Battleships were quickly disposed of, as they were very expensive to operate and maintain, but their only conceivable role after 1945 was shore bombardment. (1946) was the last battleship constructed by any nation, and nicknamed &quot;Britain’s Mightiest Mothball&quot;, as she saw only limited use, often for non-military purposes. A badminton court was constructed on the deck in 1947, for use by the royal family during her time as a royal yacht. It was the last British battleship when it was decommissioned in 1960. Rear-Admiral John Grant commented at the time that &quot;The battleship is out of date and has now been replaced as a capital ship of the fleet by the aircraft carrier&quot;.
A modest new construction programme was initiated with some new carriers (&quot;Majestic&quot;- and &quot;Centaur&quot;-class light carriers, and &quot;Audacious&quot;-class large carriers being completed between 1948 through 1958), along with three &quot;Tiger&quot;-class cruisers (completed 1959–61), the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers in the 1950s, and finally the County-class guided missile destroyers completed in the 1960s.

The Navy began plans to replace its fleet of aircraft carriers in the mid-1960s. A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000 tons; the plan was designated CVA-01. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy&#x27;s place as a major naval power. Harold Wilson&#x27;s new Labour government that came to power in the 1964 general election was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the 1966 Defence White Paper the project was cancelled. The existing carriers (all built during, or just after World War II) were refitted, two ( and ) becoming &quot;commando&quot; carriers, and four (, , and ) being completed or rebuilt. Starting in 1965 with , one by one these carriers were decommissioned without replacement, culminating with the 1979 retirement of &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. By the early 1980s, only survived and received a refit (just in time for the Falklands War), to operate Sea Harriers. She operated along with three much smaller s, and the fleet was now centred around anti-submarine warfare in the north Atlantic as opposed to its former position with worldwide strike capability. Along with the war era carriers, all of the war built cruisers and destroyers, along with the post-war built &quot;Tiger&quot;-class cruisers and large County-class guided-missile destroyers were either retired or sold by 1984.

===Korean War, 1950–1953===

The Royal Navy served in the Korean War as part of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea (BCFK), which also included forces from other Commonwealth nations such as Australia. Britain, like its allies, supported South Korea against invasion from the North. The most significant naval engagement, the Battle of Chumonchin Chan, took place on July 2, 1950, when four Korean People&#x27;s Navy torpedo boats engaged a fleet of UN Command ships, including and &quot;HMS Black Swan&quot;. All four North Korean vessels were sunk in ten minutes, and were never able to launch any torpedoes. The engagement would deter North Korea from further conflict with UN warships, though they continued to make use of coastal bombardment, with &quot;Jamaica&quot; struck by a shell on July 8. While the ship survived, four artillerymen were killed and became the first British casualties in the war.

The war did not see any further large engagements between ships, though there were engagements between minesweepers and other smaller ships. Navy carriers would continue to provide support for Supermarine Seafires, Fairey Fireflies and Hawker Sea Furies.

===Suez Crisis, 1956===

British-Egyptian relations had soured considerably since the Egyptian revolution of 1952. The Egyptian government had signed arms treaties with Warsaw Pact states and increasingly moved against British goals in the region- and prime minister Anthony Eden privately wished to depose President Gamal Abdel Nasser. When the Egyptian government nationalised the Suez Canal, threatening Western access to a strategically important waterway, Egypt was invaded by Israel on 29 October.

Anglo-French forces had begun gathering in the Mediterranean that August. In terms of Royal Navy assets, this included an aircraft carrier task group, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, minesweepers and an amphibious warfare squadron. The action began with a week long air assault, and when it became clear that paratroopers landing in Operation Telescope would be unable to occupy Port Said on their own, this was followed by a naval attack on November 6. Following in behind their minesweepers, the fleet advanced on the Egyptian coast- this allowed them to avoid Russian mines which had been set in their path. The navy supported a successful amphibious landing, but the force failed to cripple the Egyptian army, which had simply re-positioned back into the dense streets.

While the operation had broadly met its military objectives, Britain and France faced an extreme negative response internationally, even from allies including the United States and Canada. The fact that the United States had refused to support the endeavour – not wishing to compromise wider Arab relations – exposed the weakness of Britain and France after their retreat. Britain in particular had lost its status as superpower, and it accelerated the process of decolonisation. Most of the British Empire was broken up within a decade.

===Cod Wars, 1958–1976===

The Royal Navy was involved in three confrontations with the Icelandic Coast Guard from 1958 to 1976. These largely bloodless incidents became known as the Cod Wars, and were part of a dispute relating to fishing waters. Royal Navy ships were involved in attempts to cut the nets of Icelandic trawlers, and later equipped with ramming equipment to intentionally strike Icelandic ships. After Iceland ended diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and threatened to withdraw from NATO, a peace settlement was reached. The conflict resulted in British recognition of an Icelandic economic zone over a large area of water. As the area in question was a prime fishing ground, the exclusive Icelandic access resulted in thousands of British job losses.

===Polaris programme, 1962–1996===
In 1962 a new became Britain&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine. The following year, the Polaris Sales Agreement allowed Britain to purchase the Polaris missile from the United States, for the purpose of submarine based nuclear deterrent. The highly favourable terms came at a surprise to the British, and it represented a warming of relations which had been troubled in the immediate aftermath of the Suez crisis. In 1968 the first ballistic missile submarine was commissioned, armed with the new missiles. The Royal Navy later became wholly responsible for the maintenance of the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. Even so, the Labour government had announced in 1966 that Britain would not mount major operations without the help of allies, and that the existing carrier force would be maintained into the 1970s. Christopher Mayhew and Sir David Luce resigned in protest, but to no avail. Britain withdrew from the east of Suez, cancelling its planned CVA-01 large carrier, and other than Polaris focused on its NATO responsibilities of anti-submarine warfare, defending US Navy carrier groups in the GIUK gap. Polaris-armed submarines patrolled the North Atlantic from 1968 to 1996. The Polaris program was eventually abolished in favour of the newer Trident system.

===Beira Patrol, 1966–1975===

With UN support, Britain applied sanctions on Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) after it unilaterally declared independence without meeting preconditions including adopting racial equality. After Rhodesia sought to circumvent an oil embargo by importing oil through the port of Beira in Portuguese Mozambique, the Royal Navy began a nine year blockade of the port- though they could not approach closer than the 6 nautical mile territorial limit. Navy personnel boarded and questioned oil tankers arriving in the port, and after United Nations Security Council Resolution 221, were authorised to use force against non compliant tankers. Approximately 80 Royal Navy ships were involved in the blockade at various points, including the aircraft carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, though the operation was scaled back after the independence of Madagascar in 1971 to only two ships, and the operation ended after Mozambique gained independence in 1975.

The patrol was a costly endeavour that was difficult to organise from a legal and political perspective, and failed to achieve its goals. It has been described as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot;.

===Falklands War, 1982===

The most important operation conducted predominantly by the Royal Navy after the Second World War was the defeat in 1982 of Argentina in the Falkland War. Only four days after the invasion on 2 April, a Task Force sailed for the South Atlantic, with other warships and support ships following. On 25 April the navy retook South Georgia, crippling an Argentine Navy submarine called the &quot;Santa Fė&quot;. Despite losing four naval ships and other civilian and RFA ships the Royal Navy proved it was still able to fight a battle 8,345 miles (12,800 km) from Great Britain. is the only nuclear-powered submarine to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes, sinking the Argentine cruiser ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot;.

===Operations after 1982===

Between 1954 and 1971 the Royal Navy&#x27;s geographical commands were merged into fewer but larger commands.

In the Home and Mediterranean Fleets after 1951, flotillas became headquarters supervising multiple squadrons, to conform with American practice. The squadrons of the Home Fleet were grouped under a Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home Fleet becoming the main seagoing flag officer. A similar arrangement applied to the Flag Officer, Flotillas, Mediterranean Fleet. The Flag Officer 5th Cruiser Squadron became Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet with similar seagoing duties. Increasingly the term &#x27;Submarine Flotilla&#x27; was used to describe the squadrons under command of the Flag Officer, Submarines. In 1967 the Home and Mediterranean Fleets were merged to form the Western Fleet.

By the end of 1969 the posts of Commanders-in-Chief at Portsmouth and Plymouth were unified into a single office of the Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command (CINCNAVHOME). The office was originally held by a four star admiral responsible for ashore support in the United Kingdom.

In November 1971, further reductions resulted in the Western Fleet being amalgamated with the Far East Fleet, resulting in a single operational Commander-in-Chief, Commander-in-Chief Fleet (CINCFLEET). He was a member of both the Admiralty and Navy Boards. This command was held by a four star admiral were based at Northwood Headquarters, in Middlesex, on the outskirts of London. Between 1971 and the 1990s the Admiral supervised five flag officers: Flag Officer, Carriers and Amphibious Ships; Flag Officer, First Flotilla; Flag Officer, Second Flotilla, the submarines, and Flag Officer, Third Flotilla. In 1992 Fleet Headquarters moved to Portsmouth.

Between 1990 and 1992 the system was changed. The Third Flotilla was abolished and the remaining two flotillas were re-designated. The Surface Flotilla under the Flag Officer, Surface Flotilla (FOSF) became responsible for operational readiness and training. The other officer, Commander United Kingdom Task Group (COMUKTG), would command any larger specially deployed naval force.

From 2004 CINCFLEET was based at at Portsmouth. In April 2012 CINCFLEET and CINCNAVHOME were downgraded from full Admirals to Vice-Admirals and their roles redesignated. The new titles were Fleet Commander and Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff.

In the latter stages of the Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also mine countermeasures and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf War against Iraq, with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking a large proportion of the Iraqi Navy.

==Since 1991==

With the end of the Cold War, and the end of the Soviet submarine threat, the objectives and purpose of the Royal navy changed significantly. Major cutbacks were made over the following decades, with around half of the submarine fleet disposed of by 1995. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1993. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 further reduced the size of the surface fleet.

The British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War highlighted several oversights in naval policy at the time, including a need for Britain to project power outside the Middle East. This led to the 2003 Delivering Security in a Changing World white paper, which promised a somewhat brighter long-term future for the Navy, putting in place the largest naval procurement programme since the end of the Second World War in order to enhance and rebuild the fleet, with a view to bringing the Navy&#x27;s capabilities into the 21st century, and restructuring the fleet from a North Atlantic-based, large anti-submarine force into a true blue water navy once more. Whilst several smaller vessels were to be withdrawn from service, it was confirmed that two new large aircraft carriers would be constructed. New and more capable ships were built; notably the &quot;Sheffield&quot;-class destroyers, the Type 21, Type 22, and Type 23 frigates, new LPDs of the , and , but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size.

From 2001, Britain became engaged in several long running conflicts in Afghanistan, the Middle East and North Africa, including hostilities in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. These wars largely stem from the September 11 attacks, and the Arab Spring. Some of these conflicts are also considered part of the global war on terrorism.

===Trident programme, 1994- present===

With the retirement of the Polaris missile planned for the mid 1990s, Trident was designed in the later stages of the Cold War as a continuing submarine-launched British Nuclear deterrent. The project was intended to defend against an attack from the Warsaw Pact nations—a foe which had disbanded by the time the first Trident missiles ultimately entered service in 1994, aboard . Following the retirement of the WE.177 bomb in 1998, Trident became the only British nuclear programme in operation. The submarines are based at HMNB Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland. Particularly since the end of the Cold War, the programme has seen public opposition, notably from the Scottish National Party. The UK parliament voted to renew Trident in 2016, an action which extended the programme into the 2030s.

===Sierra Leone, 2000===
The Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) saw a brief British military intervention in 2000. was stationed in nearby international waters from 1999 over humanitarian concerns. A larger Royal Navy flotilla supported UN troops in late 2000, but only remained in the area for a few weeks. The intervention took place late in the Civil War, and while successful it demonstrated issues with post- cold war naval policy that had not been addressed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR). The document had not foreseen a need for British involvement in sub-Saharan Africa on that scale. This was one of the reasons for the change of direction in naval policy offered by the 2003 paper &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;.

===Afghanistan, 2001–2014===

An international coalition invaded Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks. With Afghanistan being a landlocked country, the navy was involved less than other branches of the British armed forces. However, 1,000 navy personnel were deployed in Helmand Province in 2008, due to a shortage of troops with specialist skills. The navy personnel worked in support roles such as radio operators, drivers, and medics. From 2006 to 2014, the navy personnel were also responsible for repair work for aircraft. The navy was not part of Operation Toral, the continued British presence in Afghanistan, with all Helmand troops withdrawn in 2014. The withdrawal took place amidst significant debate about the rationale, impact, and casualties of the war in Afghanistan.

===Iraq war, 2003–2011===
The Navy took part in the 2003 Iraq War as part of Operation Telic under Commander David Snelson. The Navy was both involved in the 2003 invasion as well as the subsequent insurgency period. This conflict saw RN warships bombard positions in support of the Al Faw Peninsula landings by Royal Marines. and launched a number of Tomahawk cruise missiles at targets in Iraq. By the later stages of the operation the navy was present in a training capacity, working with Iraqi sailors. The war also saw two major international incidents caused by Iranian capture of Royal Navy personnel in the Persian Gulf.

In 2004, Iranian armed forces took Royal Navy personnel prisoner, including Royal Marines, on the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud in Persian) river, between Iran and Iraq. They were released three days later following diplomatic discussions between the UK and Iran. In August 2005 the Royal Navy rescued seven Russians stranded in a submarine off the Kamchatka peninsula. Using its Scorpio 45, a remote-controlled mini-sub, the submarine was freed from the fishing nets and cables that had held the Russian submarine for three days.

In 2007, Iranian armed forces also took prisoner Royal Navy personnel, including Royal Marines, when a boarding party from was seized in the waters between Iran and Iraq, in the Persian Gulf. They were released thirteen days later. The Royal Navy was also involved in an incident involving Somali pirates in November 2008, after the pirates tried to capture a civilian vessel.

While most British forces were recalled in 2009, 81 Royal Navy personnel were present in Umm Qasr for training purposes until their final withdrawal in 2011.

===Strategic Review Cuts, 2010–2020===
The navy faced significant cuts following the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, amid wider austerity in the United Kingdom during the 2010s. The review reduced the number of personnel by 5,000 to a total of 30,000. A 2013 report found that the navy was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked. These losses were partially mitigated in the 2015 review which added 400 personnel, due to &quot;concern about the ability of the armed forces to fulfil all the tasks expected of them&quot;. The surface fleet was reduced by 9 ships to 19 over the period. The decommission of the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was brought forward to 2011, leaving the navy without a commissioned aircraft carrier for the first time since they were introduced to the fleet in 1918. Capability was restored with the commission of &quot;HMS Queen Elizabeth&quot; in 2017. The reviews also resulted in a significant reduction in defence estate, with approximately 30% of MoD estate to be disposed in the period. This included a small amount of the naval estate, including &quot;HMS Sultan&quot;.

===First Libyan civil war, 2011===

The Royal Navy was among the British forces that took part in the military intervention in Libya. The operation began on 19 March, two days after United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which granted the international mandate for the action. The Navy was involved on several levels - this included submarine-launched missile strikes, particularly in the early stages of the fighting, and evacuation of civilians. was attacked by a shore battery during the fighting, the first time a Royal Navy ship had been fired at since the Falklands War in 1982. &quot;Liverpool&quot; destroyed the battery with her main gun, along with a munitions convoy later that day. The operation concluded on 31 October, shortly after the death of Gaddafi which concluded the civil war.

===War on ISIL, 2014–present===

The 2014 rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant resulted in British military intervention under Operation Shader. This drew the Royal Navy back into Libyan and Iraqi waters, which it had withdrawn from only three years previously. In Libya this was in order to evacuate civilians while in Iraq and Syria this was to support air strikes. During the initial hostilities, HMS &quot;Defender&quot; took on the role of escort in the gulf for the &quot;USS George H W Bush&quot;, while other ships acted from the Mediterranean.

==Trends in ship strength==
In numeric terms the Royal Navy has significantly reduced in size since the 1960s, reflecting the reducing requirement of the state. This raw figure does not take into account the increase in technological capability of the Navy&#x27;s ships, but it does show the general reduction of capacity. The following table is a breakdown of the fleet numbers since 1960. The separate types of ship and how their numbers have changed are shown.
* &#x27;Patrol ships and craft&#x27; as of 2025 include: 8 Offshore Patrol Vessels, 1 Survey Ship, 1 Survey Motor Launch, 1 Icebreaker and 18 Patrol Boats.
* Current figures exclude the main 13 auxiliary support vessels currently used by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary that provide at sea replenishment, as sea maintenance if required, some patrol tasks acting as &quot;mothership&quot; and also form as a main logistics transport fleet, utilising vessels such as the Bay-class landing ship and others.

<text>Mahlon Dickerson Manson (February 20, 1820 – February 4, 1895) was a druggist, Indiana politician, and a Union general in the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Manson was born in Piqua, Ohio, to David Manson Jr., and Sarah Cornwall. He was a descendant of David Manson, an aide to Revolutionary War General George Washington. His family moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was a school teacher in Montgomery County, Indiana. He studied medicine in Cincinnati, Ohio, and gave medical lectures in New Orleans. During the Mexican–American War he served with the 5th Indiana Volunteers as a captain. He was a druggist in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and a member of the Indiana Legislature.

At the beginning of the Civil War, he was appointed a captain in the 10th Indiana Infantry and was promoted to colonel in less than a month. He commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio at the Battle of Mill Springs in 1862 and was promoted to brigadier general on March 24, 1862, based on his actions there. General Manson was wounded in the thigh and captured by Confederate forces at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky. He was exchanged two months later and fought Morgan on his raid into Ohio. In the span of two months, Manson advanced from brigade, to division and then to command the XXIII Corps. He led the corps during the Knoxville Campaign seeing action at Campbell&#x27;s Station and Knoxville. General Manson returned to brigade command, in the Army of the Ohio, during the Atlanta Campaign and was seriously wounded in the Battle of Resaca, Georgia.

After the war, he served in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat from 1871 to 1873, was state auditor, and the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana from 1885 to 1886.

Manson died in Frankfort, Indiana, and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Crawfordsville.

<doc id="1139122" wikidata="Q668565" url="?curid=1139122" title="Dacia Logan">
<text>The Dacia Logan is a family of automobiles produced and marketed jointly by the French manufacturer Renault and its Romanian subsidiary Dacia since mid-2004, and was the successor to the Dacia 1310 and Dacia Solenza. It has been produced as a sedan, station wagon, and as a pick-up. It has been manufactured at Dacia&#x27;s automobile plant in Mioveni, Romania, and at Renault (or its partners&#x27;) plants in Morocco, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Russia, Colombia, Iran and India. The pick-up has also been produced at Nissan&#x27;s plant in Rosslyn, South Africa.

It has also been marketed as the Renault Logan, Nissan Aprio, Mahindra Verito, Renault L90, Lada Largus (the MCV), Nissan NP200 (the pick-up), Renault Symbol (Mk3), Renault Taliant, and as the Renault Tondar 90 depending on the existing presence or positioning of the Renault brand.
Since its launch, the Dacia Logan is estimated to have reached over 4 million sales worldwide.


==First generation (L90/U90/F90; 2004)==
The first-generation Logan was designed at Renault&#x27;s Technocentre near Paris, being the result of four years of development of the X90 project, announced by Renault in 1999, after the purchase of Dacia in the same year.

During a visit to Russia by French President Jacques Chirac, Louis Schweitzer noted that at Lada and Renault dealerships the €6,000 Ladas were selling very well while the €12,000 Renaults stayed in the showroom. &quot;Seeing those antiquated cars, I found it unacceptable that technical progress should stop you making a good car for €6,000.&quot; The cheapest version of the car is €5,900, and the price can reach €11,200, depending on equipment and customs duty. (The base model for Western Europe, where it is badged as a Dacia but generally sold in Renault dealerships, is somewhat more expensive).

The Logan was designed from the outset as an affordable car, and has many simplified features to keep costs down. It replaces many older cars in production, including the Romanian Dacia 1310 series of Renault 12-based cars.

It was officially launched in June 2004, and began marketing in September 2004. Renault originally had no plans to sell the Logan in Western Europe, but in June 2005, they began importing a more expensive version of the car, starting at around €7,500. It was an unexpected success with people wanting an inexpensive, no-frills car they could repair themselves.

===Facelift===
On 1 July 2008, almost four years after the release of the first Logan, a facelifted version called the &quot;Dacia New Logan&quot; was announced. The new version features a more modern design and a more attractive and more comfortable interior. This facelift was adopted on the station wagon in October the same year.

===Features===

The Logan is based on the Dacia B0 platform, also used for other Renault and Nissan models. It has 50% fewer parts than a high-end Renault vehicle and has a limited number of electronic devices. This makes the car cheaper to produce and easier and cheaper to repair.

Some parts are also much simpler than those of its competitors. For example, rear-view mirrors are symmetrical and can be used on either side of the car, the windshield is flatter than usual, and the dashboard is a single injection-molded piece.

The developers have taken into account several differences between road and climate conditions in developed and developing countries. The Logan suspension is soft and strong, and the chassis sits visibly higher than most other compact cars to help it negotiate dirt roads and potholes on ill-maintained asphalt roads. The engine is specially prepared to handle lower quality fuel, whereas the air conditioning is powerful enough to lower the temperature several degrees (temperatures above 40 °C are common in the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea).

===Trim levels===
In Romania, it was initially available in four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic trim level, Ambiance, featured a driver airbag, optional body-coloured bumpers, wheel trims and electric door locks. The second trim level, Preference, added a passenger airbag, power steering, electric front windows, a radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking. The third trim level, Laureate, added front fog lights, air conditioning, a trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat head restraints and a multi-adjustable driver seat. The top trim level, Ambition also had ABS, electric rear windows, a CD player and alloy wheels. The 1.6-litre petrol engine was only available starting with the Preference trim level. In September 2005, the 1.5-litre diesel engine was introduced, initially not being available on the Ambition trim level. In January 2006, a new intermediate trim level called Laureate Plus was added, which in addition to the Laureate trim level featured ABS, electric rear windows and a CD player. Also, the diesel engine became available for the Ambition trim level.

In September 2006, several improvements were introduced to the range, such as a new button for the trunk lid, a new knob for the gear lever, crystal rear lamps, as well as new designs for the wheel trims and the alloy wheels in addition to three new paint colours. Also, the new top of the range level Prestige was introduced, which featured larger door mirrors, body-coloured bumpers (entirely), side moldings and door handles, leather-trimmed gear lever and steering wheel, as well as other interior refinements. It was only available with a new 1.6-litre 16-valve petrol engine, which developed .

In July 2007, a more powerful version of the 1.5-litre diesel engine was added, developing . It was initially made available only for the station wagon, on the Preference and Laureate levels, and in September 2007, it also became available for the sedan version, on the Laureate, Ambition and Prestige levels.

In June 2009, the new 1.2-litre 16-valve petrol engine was added for both the Logan and the Sandero. The engine was capable of developing a maximum power of and of torque.

===Safety===
In June 2005, the car achieved a three-star rating at the Euro NCAP crash tests. This result confirms initial expectations stated previously by Renault.

Depending on the equipment level, standard on some variants and optional on others, the facelifted Logan comes with driver, passenger and side airbags. In terms of active safety, all versions feature the latest generation Bosch 8.1 ABS, which incorporates EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution) and EBA (emergency brake assist).

===Engines===
When the Logan appeared, all engines complied to the Euro 3 standard and since January 2007, all engines have complied with the Euro 4 standard, including the diesel engine, whose power has increased to 70 hp.

===Marketing and production===

The Logan, vital to increasing sales of the Renault group to the 4 million mark by 2010, is manufactured in nine production and operational assembly centres: Romania (Automobile Dacia), the pilot plant of the Logan Programme, Russia (Avtoframos), Morocco (Somaca), Colombia (Sofasa), Iran (two assembly plants (Iran Khodro and Pars Khodro) supervised by Renault-Pars), India (Mahindra), Brazil (Renault), and South Africa (Nissan South Africa). The CKD centre is named the International Logistics Network and is located near the Mioveni plant in Romania. It is the biggest logistic centre of its kind, not only within the Renault Group but in the entire global automotive industry.

====Dacia models====
In markets where Renault has a presence, such as Europe (Russia, Belarus and Ukraine excepted), Turkey, the Maghreb, and Chile, it is generally sold as the Dacia Logan.

====Renault &amp; Nissan models====
Exceptions are South Africa, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, Colombia, Ecuador, Israel, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Saudi Arabia, India, Nepal and Venezuela where it is marketed as the &quot;Renault Logan&quot;, and furthermore Mexico, where the Logan was sold as the &quot;Nissan Aprio&quot;, given the better reputation of the Japanese brand and stronger brand recognition of Nissan itself in the Mexican market. The Nissan Aprio has the 1.6-litre 16 valve straight-four engine with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, and was assembled in Brazil. It was later discontinued from that market in August 2010, due to decreasing sales, and the Versa replaced it for the 2012 model year.

In Brazil, it was manufactured by Renault at the São José dos Pinhais factory since 2007, with the facelifted model being introduced in 2010.

In South Africa, only the pick-up version was manufactured, at the Nissan factory in Rosslyn, starting from 2009.

====India====
In India, the Logan was marketed as the &quot;Mahindra Renault Logan&quot;. In 2005, Renault partnered the Indian utility and commercial vehicles manufacturer Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M). The Logan was launched in India in April 2007, as a collaboration with Mahindra, who helped Renault cut costs by 15%. India was the first right-hand drive market for the Logan. Logan could not make it in the Indian market, selling just over 44,000 vehicles since then, with an additional 2,600 vehicles in Nepal and South Africa where M&amp;M also held the licence to sell the Logan. In April 2010, it was announced that the M&amp;M had bought out Renault&#x27;s 49% in the Mahindra-Renault joint venture. The new agreement gave M&amp;M more flexibility in engineering the car to suit the needs of the Indian consumer. The Logan was marketed with the Mahindra-Renault logo until the end of March 2011.

=====Mahindra Verito=====

Following the dissolution of the Indian joint venture between Renault India and M&amp;M in 2010, Mahindra retained the rights to produce and sell the Logan under its own name of &quot;Mahindra Verito&quot;, with minor alterations to the front, but retaining Renault diesel engines. On 26 July 2012, a facelifted version of the car was revealed by Mahindra in New Delhi, and on 5 June 2013, a notchback version was launched in Mumbai, called the Mahindra Verito Vibe. Production was shut down on 31 December 2019.

An electric version of the Verito sedan and its notchback version Verito Vibe was sold as the &quot;Mahindra eVerito&quot; from 2016. Production was shut down on 31 December 2019.

====Iran====

In 2007, the Logan branded as &quot;Renault Tondar 90&quot; (also called Renault L90), began to be marketed in Iran by Renault-Pars, manufactured by Pars Khodro and Iran Khodro. In the first month of production more than 100,000 Tondar 90 had been ordered. Renault Pars is a joint venture, 51 percent of which belongs to Renault of France. Forty-nine percent of Renault Pars&#x27; shares is jointly held by Iran&#x27;s Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, IKCO and Saipa Group. The company was established in 2003. In 2010, IKCO and Pars Khodro started to produce CNG Tondar 90s which can run on both petrol and CNG. They stopped producing CNG models in 2012. In 2013, IKCO started to produce Tondar 90s with automatic gearbox and they also made it comply with the Euro IV standards. A facelifted version is sold as the Tondar 90+, along with the original one. There is also a pickup version called the Tondar Pick-Up. In 2014 Renault updated the transmission of Logan for Iranian market using JHQ gearbox instead of regular JH3 to make the car more reliable.

By 2018, Renault had left the Iranian market but in 2023, Pars Khodro released a facelifted version of the original Dacia Logan called &quot;Pars Khodro Cadilla&quot; with over 85 percent local parts content. The Cadila uses the 1.6-litre Saipa ME16 engine, which is actually an updated version of the PSA TU5 engine.

====Electric versions====
=====United States=====
In the United States, an attempt at marketing electric versions of the wagon, the van and the pick-up as the &quot;EMC E36&quot; was launched by the EnVision Motor Company, based in Des Moines, Iowa. The automobiles were assembled by Dacia in Romania and powered by an asynchronous motor with a range of per charge, giving a top highway speed as high as . EMC planned to use regenerative braking and is coupled to an automatic shiftless button transmission. The battery can be charged through a J1772 plug or from wall outlets of either 120 or 240 volts. This venture has since collapsed into bankruptcy.

=====Russia=====
The Lada e-Largus was announced on August 8, 2022, being a fully electric version based on the Largus Furgon model, and AvtoVAZ&#x27;s first production electric vehicle since the Ellada in the early 2010s.

====Production====
Logan production began with a 4-door sedan, followed by a wagon in September 2006. Four other models, a pick-up truck, a panel van, a related hatchback (the Sandero) and a facelifted sedan followed in 2007 and 2008. Dacia sales for 2006 were over €1.5 billion, 19.6% more than in 2005. Annual production has reached almost 250,000 cars, half for exports. As of March 2009, more than 1.3 million vehicles on the Logan platform have been sold worldwide. On 3 September 2009, it was announced that one million Dacia cars on the Logan platform X90 have been produced at the Mioveni plant: 576,887 Logans, 246,869 Logan MCVs, 144,931 Sanderos and Stepways, 19,897 Logan VANs and 11,416 Logan Pick-Ups.

One of the reasons for the increase in sales is the dependability of Dacia cars. In a recent survey conducted by a French magazine, Dacia cars were voted one of the safest cars in France. Another reason is their low maintenance and repair costs. According to the survey, Dacia cars were the cheapest to maintain and repair. In Germany, Dacia was placed on the second position in the 2010 Vehicle Ownership Satisfaction Study released by J. D. Power and Associates in June 2010.

===Logan MCV===
The Logan MCV (&quot;Multi Convivial Vehicle&quot;), launched at the 2006 Paris Motor Show, is the station wagon version of the Logan. It has 5- or 7-seat versions, with a luggage space between 200 and 2,350 litres depending on how many seats are folded, and numerous storage spaces for smaller objects. It has a wheelbase longer by than the saloon, and larger rear doors for easy access to the third row of seats. It uses the same engines as the saloon, and an important improvement was the availability of side airbags. It has been considered a competitor for compact MPVs, for its dimensions and the 7-seat capacity.

Sales on the Romanian market began in October 2006 with prices ranging between €8,200 and €12,550, while sales to other countries began in early 2007. A revised version, with the new lights and bumper from the New Logan saloon, was released in late 2008. As of June 2010, Dacia produced 300,000 Logan MCVs.

2012–2022, it was also produced in Russia, by the AvtoVAZ company, under the Lada Largus brand name, after it was previously exhibited at the 2010 Moscow International Motor Show as the Lada Project R90. It is also offered with crossover-style body elements as the Largus Cross.

===Logan Van===

The panel van variant of the Logan was launched on 23 January 2007 in Bucharest. It is a small business oriented vehicle, with 2,500 litre loading space and 800 kg payload. The Logan Van is more or less an MCV without the rear side windows and therefore has the same safety features and uses the same engines as the other models (except the 1.6 16v engine). Production of this model was stopped in August 2012. Since its launch, over 53,000 units were manufactured. The panel van version is continued to be produced as the Lada Largus under the Lada brand at AvtoVAZ.

===Logan Pick-Up===
The coupé utility version of the Logan, also based on the MCV, was introduced on 10 September 2007 (4 October 2007 at the Bucharest International Motor Show), and replaced the Dacia Pick-Up. Sales began in Romania in 2008, with the price ranging between €7,300 and €9,450.

Logan Pick-Up was discontinued by Dacia in July 2012, and it was not until October 2020 that the company introduced a new pickup model, Dacia Duster Pick-Up.

Starting October 2008, the Logan Pick-Up is sold in South Africa as the Nissan NP200. Visually similar to the original model at launch, it received a light facelift in early 2009. It is being built at the Nissan plant outside Pretoria, alongside the Renault Sandero, and is also exported to several Southern Africa countries such as Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Seychelles and Botswana. In March 2024, the NP200 is discontinued.

It is also offered, as of 2016, in Iran, as the Renault Tondar Pick-Up.

==Second generation (L52/K52; 2012)==


The second generation Logan was revealed by Dacia at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Official photos with the new Logan were released on 17 September 2012. It shares the same front end design with the second generation Sandero, also revealed at the motor show, as well as other elements too.

According to Dacia, 60% of the design work was carried out in Romania, at Renault&#x27;s engineering centre.

===Features===
Among the new features introduced with the new model there was a new three-cylinder turbocharged 0.9-litre petrol engine and capable of developing and . The other two engine options are the 1.2-litre 16-valve petrol engine, initially available also as an LPG variant, and the 1.5-litre diesel engine, available with two power outputs. Their performance figures are predominantly similar to the ones of the second generation Sandero. Later, the 1.2-litre LPG variant was discontinued, in favor of the 0.9 TCe, as the first did not meet the new Euro 6 emission standards.

Another addition was the Media Nav system, already introduced earlier in the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the engine revs to 4,000 rpm.

At the end of 2014, Dacia started to produce Euro 6 engines, with reduced exhaust emissions. From August 2015, the 0.9 TCe engine is equipped with the Start &amp; Stop system.

Starting from the end of 2016, the Dacia Logan range is offered with the &quot;Dacia Easy-R&quot; automated manual transmission (AMT).

===Variants===
In the European market, the new Logan is available in different trim levels: Access, Ambiance, Laureate, Stepway, Prestige. The Access level comes with black bumpers and power steering, and is available only with the 1.2-litre engine. Ambiance has body-coloured bumpers, wheel covers, Eco mode function, power lock doors, front power windows or CD player, and as options there are metallic paint, fog lights and air conditioning. Laureate adds body-coloured door handles, fog lights as standard and trip computer, and additionally can be ordered with metallic paint, Media Nav system, leather upholstery, parking sensors, cruise control or alloy wheels. This is the only equipment level available for the version of the 1.5-litre diesel engine.

In June 2014, a limited edition was made available in order to celebrate 10 years since the model&#x27;s launch. There will be produced only 2,000 units of this version, which features new equipment such as automatic air conditioning, double optic fog lights, mirror-mounted repeaters, 16-inch wheels, along with several special design elements like the different dashboard lighting (white instead of the then usual amber colour). This model was only available on the Romanian market and came equipped with 1.2 16v petrol and 1.5 dci diesel engines, both having 75 bhp. 

In October 2015, Dacia launched the new Prestige trim level, which has automatic air conditioning, mirror-mounted repeaters and 16-inch wheels.

=== Logan MCV ===
The estate version of the car made its debut at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The car will keep the MCV name, although it now stands for &quot;Maximum Capacity Vehicle&quot;, rather than the previous &quot;Multi Convivial Vehicle&quot;. It has 5 seats and a luggage capacity between and , featuring the same standard equipment and engine range as the saloon. It began to be marketed from the second half of 2013.

===Facelift===
Dacia presented the new Logan facelift at the 2016 Paris Motor Show. The Romanian car manufacturer models have a new design, a new steering wheel and a new 1.0-litre engine.

The Dacia designers wanted to give a new look for the Dacia models and the front side comes with several new features. The front and back bumpers have been slightly redesigned and the headlights have a new design that includes LED day running lights (it is the first time that Dacia models offer LED lights). The aesthetic package is completed by a new front grille, similar to the one found on the Duster.

The interior changes include a four-spoke steering wheel that includes the horn, new buttons and new chrome lines to suggest a new look. There is also a new glossy plastic that covers the dashboard and fits better with the &quot;MediaNav&quot; multimedia system that has received an updated interface with a better resolution.
=== Logan Stepway/Intens ===
Since the release of the facelift version, the Logan is also available with the crossover-styled Stepway trim, which feature raised ride height and adds exterior accessories such as black plastic wheel arch trims, body cladding, skid plates and roof rails. In February 2017, the Dacia Logan MCV Stepway in Europe. Starting from 2018, the Stepway version also became available for the sedan version in Latin America, and from November 2019 in Europe. The Renault Logan Stepway was launched in Russia in December 2018, followed by Brazil in July 2019 along with the facelifted model without carrying the Stepway nameplate to avoid confusion with the Sandero-based Stepway. In several South American markets including Colombia, the crossover version of the Renault Logan was available as the Intens top trim.

For versions equipped with CVT, the lifted version of the Logan is essentially a workaround to mitigate the fact that the CVT gearbox does not fit due to the tight space of the platform layout, which led to the vehicle being raised by fitting a reworked suspension. Without raising the ground clearance, the CVT unit would be too close to the ground and causes a risk of damage.

===Marketing and production===
Sales in Romania began in November 2012, with a starting price of €6,690. It is manufactured in Mioveni, Romania, and in Casablanca, Morocco, at the Somaca factory, for the North African market.

<text>Charles Leslie McFarlane (October 25, 1902 – September 6, 1977) was a Canadian journalist, novelist, screenwriter, and filmmaker, who is most famous for ghostwriting many of the early books in the very successful &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; series, using the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

The son of a school principal, McFarlane was raised in the town of Haileybury, Ontario. He became a freelance writer shortly after high school. He and his family moved to Whitby, Ontario, in 1936. 
This period is described in his 1975 book &quot;A Kid in Haileybury&quot;.

=== Journalist ===

As a young man he worked in Sudbury, Ontario, as a newspaper reporter, then for a weekly paper in Toronto, before taking a job at the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts.

=== Stratemeyer Syndicate ===

While in the U.S., he replied to a want ad placed by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, publisher of such titles as &quot;Tom Swift&quot; and the &quot;Bobbsey Twins&quot;. As a result, he freelanced in 1926 and 1927 as one of the authors using the pseudonym Roy Rockwood to write seven of the &quot;Dave Fearless&quot; serialized mystery novels.

====The Hardy Boys====

This led to his involvement with the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot;, a project on which he was a large contributor, writing 19 of the first 25 books between 1927 and 1946, and 21 overall. He also wrote books in several other juvenile series, published in pulp magazines, novellas or novels over his fifty-year career, at one point writing six novels in one year. McFarlane earned as little as $85 per book during the Great Depression, yet he continued because he had a growing family.

According to his son, McFarlane regarded the Hardy Boys books as a nuisance. &quot;In his diaries, my father talks about having to write another of those cursed books, in order to earn another $100 to buy coal for the furnace. And he never read them over afterward. It was only much later that he accepted plaudits for the work.&quot;

His daughter, Norah McFarlane Perez, said in an interview that &quot;They&#x27;d give him an outline, but to make it palatable, he&#x27;d come up with different characters and add colour and use large words, and inject his wonderful sense of humour. And then he&#x27;d finish and say, &#x27;I will never write another juvenile book.&#x27; But then the bills would pile up and he&#x27;d start another.&quot;

However, McFarlane was not bitter about not earning a cut of the enormous revenues generated by his work. &quot;He was very philosophical about it. His attitude was, &#x27;Look, I took these on and I was glad to get the deal.&#x27; There was no rancour,&quot; according to his daughter.

====Nancy Drew, The Dana Girls====

McFarlane also wrote the first four volumes of &quot;The Dana Girls&quot; series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, which the Syndicate also used for the Nancy Drew series of books.

====Authorship of The Phantom Freighter====

Although there are claims that his last &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; book, &quot;The Phantom Freighter&quot;, was actually written by his wife Amy, his biographer Marilyn Greenwald concluded that this was unlikely.
In his 1976 autobiography &quot;Ghost of the Hardy Boys&quot;, McFarlane says that &quot;The Phantom Freighter&quot; &quot;was written in 1946 in motel rooms at night on a location in Nova Scotia when I was directing a film&quot;.

=== Film and television work ===

While still writing for the series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, McFarlane returned to Canada to work for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). As part of the NFB in Montreal, he wrote and directed documentaries and short dramas including the 1951 documentary &quot;Royal Journey&quot;, as well as &quot;Here&#x27;s Hockey&quot;, a 1953 documentary about ice hockey featuring Montreal Canadiens star Jean Béliveau. He also wrote the documentary titled &quot;Herring Hunt&quot;, nominated for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film. Moving to Toronto he wrote for CBC television and at the suggestion of his friend Lorne Greene.

== Legacy ==

The Leslie McFarlane Public School in Whitby, Ontario, was named in his honour until it was demolished in early 2010 when it was deemed more expensive to repair than it would be to build a new structure.
His son, Brian McFarlane, is well known as a former commentator on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

He was the subject of the 2004 book &quot;The Secret of the Hardy Boys: Leslie McFarlane and the Stratemeyer Syndicate&quot; by Marilyn Greenwald.

In 2006, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, acquired Leslie McFarlane&#x27;s diaries, correspondence, and early material, along with first editions of &quot;The Secret of the Caves&quot; and &quot;The Tower Treasure&quot;. The university plans to acquire early first editions of all of McFarlane&#x27;s books. The archive donated to McMaster is estimated to have a value of $150,000.

<doc id="1139142" wikidata="Q4978699" url="?curid=1139142" title="Bruhat decomposition">
<text>In mathematics, the Bruhat decomposition (introduced by François Bruhat for classical groups and by Claude Chevalley in general) formula_1 of certain algebraic groups formula_1 into cells can be regarded as a general expression of the principle of Gauss–Jordan elimination, which generically writes a matrix as a product of an upper triangular and lower triangular matrices—but with exceptional cases. It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of flag varieties: see Weyl group for this.

More generally, any group with a (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) pair has a Bruhat decomposition.

==Definitions==
*formula_3 is a connected, reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field.
*formula_4 is a Borel subgroup of formula_3
*formula_6 is a Weyl group of formula_3 corresponding to a maximal torus of formula_4.

The Bruhat decomposition of formula_3 is the decomposition
:formula_10
of formula_3 as a disjoint union of double cosets of formula_4 parameterized by the elements of the Weyl group formula_6. (Note that although formula_6 is not in general a subgroup of formula_3, the coset formula_16 is still well defined because the maximal torus is contained in formula_4.)

== Examples ==
Let formula_3 be the general linear group GL&quot;n&quot; of invertible formula_19 matrices with entries in some algebraically closed field, which is a reductive group. Then the Weyl group formula_6 is isomorphic to the symmetric group formula_21 on formula_22 letters, with permutation matrices as representatives. In this case, we can take formula_4 to be the subgroup of upper triangular invertible matrices, so Bruhat decomposition says that one can write any invertible matrix formula_24 as a product formula_25 where formula_26 and formula_27 are upper triangular, and formula_28 is a permutation matrix. Writing this as formula_29, this says that any invertible matrix can be transformed into a permutation matrix via a series of row and column operations, where we are only allowed to add row formula_30 (resp. column formula_30) to row formula_32 (resp. column formula_32) if formula_34 (resp. formula_35). The row operations correspond to formula_36, and the column operations correspond to formula_37.

The special linear group SL&quot;n&quot; of invertible formula_19 matrices with determinant formula_39 is a semisimple group, and hence reductive. In this case, formula_6 is still isomorphic to the symmetric group formula_21. However, the determinant of a permutation matrix is the sign of the permutation, so to represent an odd permutation in SL&quot;n&quot;, we can take one of the nonzero elements to be formula_42 instead of formula_39. Here formula_4 is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with determinant formula_39, so the interpretation of Bruhat decomposition in this case is similar to the case of GL&quot;n&quot;.

== Geometry ==
The cells in the Bruhat decomposition correspond to the Schubert cell decomposition of flag varieties. The dimension of the cells corresponds to the length of the word formula_46 in the Weyl group. Poincaré duality constrains the topology of the cell decomposition, and thus the algebra of the Weyl group; for instance, the top dimensional cell is unique (it represents the fundamental class), and corresponds to the longest element of a Coxeter group.

==Computations==
The number of cells in a given dimension of the Bruhat decomposition are the coefficients of the formula_47-polynomial of the associated Dynkin diagram.

==Double Bruhat cells==

With two opposite Borel subgroups, one may intersect the Bruhat cells for each of them, giving a further decomposition
formula_48

<doc id="1139145" wikidata="Q3042798" url="?curid=1139145" title="Cartan decomposition">
<text>In mathematics, the Cartan decomposition is a decomposition of a semisimple Lie group or Lie algebra, which plays an important role in their structure theory and representation theory. It generalizes the polar decomposition or singular value decomposition of matrices. Its history can be traced to the 1880s work of Élie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing. 

== Cartan involutions on Lie algebras ==

Let formula_1 be a real semisimple Lie algebra and let formula_2 be its Killing form. An involution on formula_1 is a Lie algebra automorphism formula_4 of formula_1 whose square is equal to the identity. Such an involution is called a &quot;Cartan involution&quot; on formula_1 if formula_7 is a positive definite bilinear form.

Two involutions formula_8 and formula_9 are considered equivalent if they differ only by an inner automorphism.

Any real semisimple Lie algebra has a Cartan involution, and any two Cartan involutions are equivalent.

=== Examples ===

* A Cartan involution on formula_10 is defined by formula_11, where formula_12 denotes the transpose matrix of formula_13.
* The identity map on formula_1 is an involution. It is the unique Cartan involution of formula_1 if and only if the Killing form of formula_1 is negative definite or, equivalently, if and only if formula_1 is the Lie algebra of a compact semisimple Lie group.
* Let formula_1 be the complexification of a real semisimple Lie algebra formula_19, then complex conjugation on formula_1 is an involution on formula_1. This is the Cartan involution on formula_1 if and only if formula_19 is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group.
* The following maps are involutions of the Lie algebra formula_24 of the special unitary group SU(n):
*# The identity involution formula_25, which is the unique Cartan involution in this case.
*# Complex conjugation, expressible as formula_26 on formula_27.
*# If formula_28 is odd, formula_29. The involutions (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent, but not equivalent to the identity involution since formula_30.
*# If formula_31 is even, there is also formula_32.

== Cartan pairs ==

Let formula_4 be an involution on a Lie algebra formula_1. Since formula_35, the linear map formula_4 has the two eigenvalues formula_37. If formula_38 and formula_39 denote the eigenspaces corresponding to +1 and -1, respectively, then formula_40. Since formula_4 is a Lie algebra automorphism, the Lie bracket of two of its eigenspaces is contained in the eigenspace corresponding to the product of their eigenvalues. It follows that

: formula_42, formula_43, and formula_44.

Thus formula_38 is a Lie subalgebra, while any subalgebra of formula_39 is commutative.

Conversely, a decomposition formula_40 with these extra properties determines an involution formula_4 on formula_1 that is formula_50 on formula_38 and formula_52 on formula_39.

Such a pair formula_54 is also called a &quot;Cartan pair&quot; of formula_1, 
and formula_56 is called a &quot;symmetric pair&quot;. This notion of a Cartan pair here is not to be confused with the distinct notion involving the relative Lie algebra cohomology formula_57.

The decomposition formula_40 associated to a Cartan involution is called a &quot;Cartan decomposition&quot; of formula_1. The special feature of a Cartan decomposition is that the Killing form is negative definite on formula_38 and positive definite on formula_39. Furthermore, formula_38 and formula_39 are orthogonal complements of each other with respect to the Killing form on formula_1.

== Cartan decomposition on the Lie group level ==

Let formula_65 be a non-compact semisimple Lie group and formula_1 its Lie algebra. Let formula_4 be a Cartan involution on formula_1 and let formula_69 be the resulting Cartan pair. Let formula_70 be the analytic subgroup of formula_65 with Lie algebra formula_38. Then:
* There is a Lie group automorphism formula_73 with differential formula_4 at the identity that satisfies formula_75.
* The subgroup of elements fixed by formula_73 is formula_70; in particular, formula_70 is a closed subgroup.
* The mapping formula_79 given by formula_80 is a diffeomorphism.
* The subgroup formula_70 is a maximal compact subgroup of formula_65, whenever the center of G is finite.

The automorphism formula_73 is also called the &quot;global Cartan involution&quot;, and the diffeomorphism formula_79 is called the &quot;global Cartan decomposition&quot;. If we write formula_85
this says that the product map formula_86 is a diffeomorphism so formula_87.

For the general linear group, formula_88 is a Cartan involution.

A refinement of the Cartan decomposition for symmetric spaces of compact or noncompact type states that the maximal Abelian subalgebras formula_89 in formula_39 are unique up to conjugation by formula_70. Moreover,

:formula_92 
where formula_93.

In the compact and noncompact case the global Cartan decomposition thus implies

:formula_94

Geometrically the image of the subgroup formula_95 in formula_96 is a totally geodesic submanifold.

== Relation to polar decomposition ==

Consider formula_97 with the Cartan involution formula_11. Then formula_99 is the real Lie algebra of skew-symmetric matrices, so that formula_100, while formula_39 is the subspace of symmetric matrices. Thus the exponential map is a diffeomorphism from formula_39 onto the space of positive definite matrices. Up to this exponential map, the global Cartan decomposition is the polar decomposition of a matrix. The polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is unique.

<doc id="1139146" wikidata="Q731350" url="?curid=1139146" title="Cuban convertible peso">
<text>The convertible peso (sometimes given as &quot;CUC$&quot; and informally called a &quot;cuc&quot; or a &quot;chavito&quot;) was one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the Cuban peso. It had been in limited use since 1994, when its value was pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar.

On 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar ceased to be accepted in Cuban retail outlets and left the convertible peso as the only currency in circulation in many Cuban businesses. Officially exchangeable only within the country, its value was increased to in April 2005, but reverted to on 15 March 2011. The convertible peso was, by the pegged rate, the twelfth-highest-valued currency unit in the world and the highest-valued &quot;peso&quot; unit.

On 22 October 2013, it was announced that the currency was to be scrapped. On 10 December 2020, it was announced that monetary unification would take effect from 1 January 2021. From that date, the CUC was no longer accepted in many Cuban businesses; it could only be exchanged in banks or CADECAs (casas de cambios), or used in certain shops, for a six-month period. On 15 June 2021, it was announced that the CUC would remain exchangeable in banks for a further six months but that no shops would accept them from 1 July. The final date for exchanging CUCs was 30 December 2021.

==History==
In 1981–1989, Cuba used so-called INTUR coins and cheques. Convertible foreign currency was exchanged into these cheques rather than the national currency, which could be used to buy some luxury goods not available for purchase in the national currency.

Also, from 1985, Banco Nacional de Cuba issued foreign exchange certificates of various types.

Because of the economic problems during the Special Period, the Cuban government allowed the possession of U.S. dollars (which had previously been illegal) and began selling goods and services in U.S. dollars, initially for tourism and for luxury items.. In 1994, they began issuing the convertible peso, to circulate together with the U.S. dollar.

This was separate from the Cuban peso (CUP), which was used for staple items. The Cuban peso (CUP) can be exchanged to the convertible peso (CUC) at exchange offices (CADECA) at a fixed rate. Since the early 2000s the rates have been 24 CUP to 1 CUC (sell) and 25 CUP to 1 CUC (buy); but for state bookkeeping purposes, both pesos are valued at a 1:1 rate.

On 8 November 2004, the Cuban government withdrew the U.S. dollar from circulation, citing the need to retaliate against further sanctions from the Helms–Burton Act. After a grace period ending on 14 November 2004, a 10% surcharge began to be imposed when converting U.S. dollars into convertible pesos. The change was announced some weeks beforehand, and was extended by the grace period. It has been claimed that it was because the amounts of U.S. dollars being exchanged were more than anticipated. The measure helped the Cuban government collect hard currency.

From 2014, some state-owned shops began to set the prices in both CUC and CUP, and accept payment in either. The 10% surcharge on converting US dollars was removed in July 2020.

Cuba&#x27;s economic difficulties since the end of 2019 have resulted in shortages of goods in CUP and CUC stores, the opening of stores priced in US dollars and only accepting payment by cards backed by foreign currencies, the waiving of the 10% penalty for exchanging US dollars, the resumption of US dollars as unofficial medium of exchange, and the plunge in the value of the CUC below US$1 in unofficial street exchanges.

==Coins==
The first minting of convertible coins took place in 1994 with face values of 5, 10, 25, and 50 convertible cents and 1 convertible peso, with their issuance taking place at the beginning of the following year.

Convertible peso coins that were minted in 1994 outside of the country (Canada) have the characteristic that when a vertical turn is made starting from the obverse of the coin, the coat of arms minted on the reverse appears upside down.

But since 1996, these coins were minted in Cuba, with the characteristic that when a vertical turn is made starting from the obverse, the coat of arms minted on the reverse appears in its normal position.

In 2000, the 1 convertible cent (1¢) coin began to be issued.


A bimetallic coin with a face value of 5 Convertible Pesos was circulated in 2004.
It was minted by the Cuban Mint in 1999, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Ernesto Che Guevara’s appointment as President of the National Bank of Cuba.

In 1994 the Central Bank of Cuba introduced notes in circulation of the new Cuban convertible peso. It is equivalent to one American dollar and allows consumers to facilitate transactions in foreign exchange with a monetary sign of their own.

=== First Series (1994) ===
They were issued by Banco Nacional de Cuba with the face values of 1, 3, 5, 10 50, and 100 convertible pesos to be accepted by the commercial network of assets and services operating in foreign exchange.

General Aspects:

Front:
* As the main vignette a partial view of monuments of heroes of Cuban independence and liberation wars.
* Different colors for each denomination.
* Denominations in letters, Arabic numbers, and Braille system.
* The series is composed of two letters and two digits, and the number is integrated by six digits.
* The signature of the president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba.
* Year of printing: 1994.
* Text stating its monetary and exchange guarantee for freely convertible currency.

Back:
* Common design to all denominations.
* The vignette corresponding to the national shield of the Republic of Cuba.
* Denomination in numbers.
* Text stating its unlimited legal tender.

Security items for all denominations:
# Water mark (Visible against the light José Martí&#x27;s effigy).
# Security thread microprinted with the text “PATRIA O MUERTE VENCEREMOS ”.
# Motive with perfect coincidence front/back (5 points star).
# Latent Image. The legend BNC can be read at a certain visual angle.
# Calcographic Microprinted (en relieve).
# Lithographic Microprinted luminescent under ultraviolet light.

=== 2004 Series ===
In the year 2004, the Central Bank of Cuba issued its first series of convertible peso bills with face values of 5 and 10 convertible pesos. 
The printing is flat, and the front and back design is generally similar to the 1994 series issued by the National Bank of Cuba, showing the legend &quot;Central Bank of Cuba&quot; and its logo.
The security elements present are the localized watermark with the effigy of José Martí and the security thread with the text &quot;PATRIA O MUERTE - VENCEREMOS&quot;.

=== 2005 Series ===
Once again, the face values of 5 and 10 convertible pesos were issued in the year 2005.
The main motifs on the front and back and the predominant colors are the same as the previous issues.
For the printing of the main elements on the front, the Intaglio system was used, which gives them higher quality, security, and aesthetics, as well as a tactile relief.

Security items:
* Watermark with the effigy of José Martí.
* Vertically located security thread with the text &quot;PATRIA O MUERTE-VENCEREMOS&quot;.
* Latent image with the initials &quot;BCC&quot; visible when changing the angle of observation.
* Continuous microtext with the legend &quot;CUBA TERRITORIO LIBRE DE AMERICA&quot; on the front and back.
* Security fibers in red, blue, and yellow distributed throughout the paper&#x27;s surface, visible only under ultraviolet light.

=== 2006 Socialist History and Achievements Series ===
A new series encompassing all denominations was put into circulation starting December 18, 2006. The Central Bank of Cuba new series of notes themed to &quot;Socialist History and Achievements&quot;. The front of the notes are similar to its previous series, but on the back of the notes, instead of depicting the Cuban coat of arms on all denominations, each of the notes now has an individualized design.

A new security feature has been incorporated into all the bills of this new series providing greater security:
* The watermark (image of José Martí on the left) is now personalized with the denomination number of the bill.
On the front of the bills, the monuments to the heroes of our liberation struggles are maintained, along with the main elements that appear in previous issues, displaying great precision and clarity, as well as tactile relief.

Main security features present in this series:

# Watermark with the effigy of José Martí on the left, personalized with the denomination number of the bill.
# Security thread with the text &quot;PATRIA O MUERTE – VENCEREMOS&quot; located to the left of the monument.
# Latent image with the initials &quot;BCC&quot; that becomes visible in the lower right corner of the front when the viewing angle is changed.

These new bills entered circulation alongside the previous issues, which retained their legal validity.


==CUC and U.S. dollar==
The convertible peso was officially pegged at from 1994 to 2005, at US$1.08 from April 2005 to March 2011, and again at since 2011. Since the end of 2019 the CUC traded below in unofficial street exchanges.

From 2005, when U.S. banknotes were exchanged, a 10% tax was applied, plus an exchange commission. The 10% tax was not applied to other currencies; From June 2020 this 10% tax on US dollars was eliminated.

<doc id="1139148" wikidata="Q750099" url="?curid=1139148" title="Iwasawa decomposition">
<text>In mathematics, the Iwasawa decomposition (aka KAN from its expression) of a semisimple Lie group generalises the way a square real matrix can be written as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix (QR decomposition, a consequence of Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization). It is named after Kenkichi Iwasawa, the Japanese mathematician who developed this method.

==Definition==
*&quot;G&quot; is a connected semisimple real Lie group.
*formula_1 is the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;
*formula_2 is the complexification of formula_1.
*θ is a Cartan involution of formula_1
*formula_5 is the corresponding Cartan decomposition
*formula_6 is a maximal abelian subalgebra of formula_7
*Σ is the set of restricted roots of formula_6, corresponding to eigenvalues of formula_6 acting on formula_1.
*Σ+ is a choice of positive roots of Σ
*formula_11 is a nilpotent Lie algebra given as the sum of the root spaces of Σ+
*&quot;K&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, are the Lie subgroups of &quot;G&quot; generated by formula_12 and formula_11.

Then the Iwasawa decomposition of formula_1 is
:formula_15
and the Iwasawa decomposition of &quot;G&quot; is
:formula_16
meaning there is an analytic diffeomorphism (but not a group homomorphism) from the manifold formula_17 to the Lie group formula_18, sending formula_19.

The dimension of &quot;A&quot; (or equivalently of formula_6) is equal to the real rank of &quot;G&quot;.

Iwasawa decompositions also hold for some disconnected semisimple groups &quot;G&quot;, where &quot;K&quot; becomes a (disconnected) maximal compact subgroup provided the center of &quot;G&quot; is finite.

The restricted root space decomposition is
:formula_21
where formula_22 is the centralizer of formula_23 in formula_24 and formula_25 is the root space. The number
formula_26 is called the multiplicity of formula_27.

==Examples==
If &quot;G&quot;=&quot;SLn&quot;(R), then we can take &quot;K&quot; to be the orthogonal matrices, &quot;A&quot; to be the positive diagonal matrices with determinant 1, and &quot;N&quot; to be the unipotent group consisting of upper triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal.

For the case of &quot;n&quot; = 2, the Iwasawa decomposition of &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SL&quot;(2, R) is in terms of
:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30

For the symplectic group &quot;G&quot; = &quot;Sp&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;, R), a possible Iwasawa decomposition is in terms of

:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33

==Non-Archimedean Iwasawa decomposition==
There is an analog to the above Iwasawa decomposition for a non-Archimedean field formula_34: In this case, the group formula_35 can be written as a product of the subgroup of upper-triangular matrices and the (maximal compact) subgroup formula_36, where formula_37 is the ring of integers of formula_34.

<doc id="1139167" wikidata="Q967719" url="?curid=1139167" title="Wealth tax">
<text>A wealth tax (also called a capital tax or equity tax) is a tax on an entity&#x27;s holdings of assets or an entity&#x27;s net worth. This includes the total value of personal assets, including cash, bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of unincorporated businesses, financial securities, and personal trusts (a one-off levy on wealth is a capital levy). Typically, wealth taxation often involves the exclusion of an individual&#x27;s liabilities, such as mortgages and other debts, from their total assets. Accordingly, this type of taxation is frequently denoted as a net wealth tax.

, five of the 36 OECD countries had a personal wealth tax (down from 12 in 1990).

Proponents often argue that wealth taxes can reduce income inequality by making it harder for individuals to accumulate large amounts of wealth. Many critics of wealth taxes claim that wealth taxes can cause wealthy people and businesses to move their wealth to lower tax jurisdiction (such as tax havens).

== OECD countries with a wealth tax ==
The Global Revenue Statistics Database presents a roster of countries that have documented instances of revenue collected from wealth taxes (the data is limited to 1965-2021). A total of eight countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland) were known to have collected revenue through a wealth tax in 1965. In the ensuing decades, the number of countries reporting wealth tax revenue increased gradually and reached its peak in 1995, with 12 countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) reporting revenue generated from this form of taxation.

Although, as of 2021, only five of the 36 OECD countries continue to implement the wealth tax on individuals.

The five countries are Colombia, France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.

==In practice==
There are jurisdictions of sovereign nation states that require declaration of the taxpayer&#x27;s balance sheet (assets and liabilities), and from that ask for a tax on net worth (assets minus liabilities), as a percentage of the net worth, or a percentage of the net worth exceeding a certain level. Wealth taxes can be limited to natural persons or they can be extended to also cover legal persons such as corporations. In 1990, about a dozen European countries had a wealth tax, but by 2019, all but three had eliminated the tax because of the difficulties and costs associated with both design and enforcement. Belgium, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland are the countries that raised revenue from net wealth taxes on individuals in 2019 with net wealth taxes accounting for 1.1% of overall tax revenues in Norway, 0.55% in Spain, and 3.6% in Switzerland for 2017.

According to an OECD study on wealth taxes, it is &quot;difficult to firmly argue that wealth taxes would have negative effects on entrepreneurship. The magnitude of the effects of wealth taxes on entrepreneurship is also unclear&quot;.

A 2022 study found that wealth taxes are most likely to be implemented in the aftermath of major economic recessions. 

In November 2024, G20 leaders agreed to &quot;engage cooperatively to ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed.&quot;

===Example countries===

==== Argentina ====
The official term used to denote the wealth tax in Argentina is &quot;Impuesto sobre los Bienes Personales&quot;.

On 31 December 2021, Argentina’s tax authorities published General Resolution 912/2021, which introduces new modifications to the country’s wealth tax.

The modifications made to the wealth tax in Argentina entail an augmentation of the non-taxable minimum to ARS 6,000,000. Moreover, residential real estate assets, wherein the owner&#x27;s daily domicile is situated, shall not be subject to taxation if their worth equals or falls under ARS 30,000,000 (approx. at April 2023 official exchange rate) . Additionally, the taxation rate structure has been revised. Assets surpassing ARS 100,000,000 (approx. at April 2023 official exchange rate) will now be taxed at a rate of 1.50%, while those exceeding ARS 300,000,000 will be taxed at a rate of 1.75%.
Before FY2021, for assets held within Argentina, the tax is progressive from 0.50% on assets above ARS 3,000,000 (approx. at April 2021 official exchange rate) to 1.25% on assets above ARS 18,000,000 (approx. at April 2021 official exchange rate). For assets held outside of Argentina, the tax is progressive from 0.70% on assets above ARS 3,000,000 to 2.25% on assets above ARS 18,000,000.

==== Belgium ====
The Act of 7 February 2018, which is effectively a &quot;wealth tax&quot;, announced an annual tax on securities accounts that imposes a 0.15% annual tax on financial instruments kept in securities accounts that are worth more than €500,000 per account holder.

The first taxable period started on 10 March 2018 and ended (at the latest on) 30 September 2018, for which the tax had to be paid by 30 August 2019. The second taxable period runs from 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019. In October 2019, the Belgian Constitutional Court issued a decision annulling this tax on securities accounts, with effect as of 1 October 2019.

However, Belgium now re-introduced the annual tax on securities accounts law with some modifications in February 2021. The Belgian Parliament adopted the adjusted tax on securities accounts law applicable from 26 February 2021, with the first reference period ending on 30 September 2021. A solidarity tax of 0.15% is now applicable on securities accounts that reach or exceed €1,000,000 without regard to the number of accountholders, and the tax amount is limited to 10% of the difference between the taxable base and the threshold of €1,000,000.

==== Bolivia ====
In December 2020, the Bolivian socialist government of President Luis Arce approved a wealth tax on resident and non-resident individuals with a net fortune of over 30 million Bolivian Boliviano. The tax is progressive with tax rates in the range of 1.4% to 2.4% and includes both domestic and foreign assets. The tax went into effect from 2020 onwards

==== Colombia ====
On 1 January 2019, the Senate passed a tax reform bill that includes a lower corporate tax rate, a new tax rate for financial corporations, and a new wealth tax. For the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, the new wealth (equity) tax has been set at 1% for Colombian-resident individuals&#x27; worldwide net worth, and 1% for non-resident individuals on Colombian properties only, such as real estate, yachts, artwork, vessels, ships, and other assets with a net equity of at least COP5 billion (). Shares in Colombian firms, accounts receivable from Colombian debtors, some portfolio assets, and financial lease agreements are all exempt from the tax. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the richest Colombians will face higher taxes on wages, dividends, and properties, as well as a one-time &quot;solidarity levy&quot; on high incomes. All of which is part of a new bill that was sent to congress in April 2021. The bill aims to collect about 25 trillion pesos () a year through new taxes and budget restraints, equating to 2.2 percent of GDP.

On 13 December 2022, the Colombian President Gustavo Petro enacted Law 2277 of 2022, which contains the tax reform proposals previously approved by congress. A new wealth tax will be introduced as a permanent tax on individuals with net worth as of 1 January of the relevant tax year exceeding 72,000 UVT. This amount will be calculated as the aggregate value of assets owned (real estate, investments, vehicles, financial products, accounts with financial institutions, etc.,), less the liabilities and debts. The tax will apply to the worldwide assets of resident individuals; nonresident individuals will be subject to wealth tax only on their Colombian assets. The tax rate is between 0 and 1,5% until 2026 and will be between 0 and 1% FY 2027 onwards. 

==== France ====
Since 2018, France has had a wealth tax based on real estate (, IFI).
It is payable by individuals who own real estate assets with a combined value of more than €1,300,000. French residents with global assets and non-residents who own French real estate may be liable for IFI. For French residents, the figure is calculated on all global real estate assets, and for non-residents, the figure is calculated based on the total value of French property and real estate assets only.

From 1989 to 2017, France had the solidarity tax on wealth (, ISF), an annual progressive wealth tax on any net assets above €800,000 for those with total net worth of €1,300,000 or more. Marginal rates ranged from 0.5% to 1.5%. In 2007, it collected €4.07 billion, accounting for 1.4% of total revenue.

==== Italy ====
Two types of wealth taxes are imposed in Italy.

* &quot;Imposta sul valore degli immobile situati all’estero&quot; or &quot;IVIE&quot;, is a 0.76% tax imposed on real assets held outside Italy. The values of such assets are determined by the purchase price or current market value. Property taxes paid in the country where the real estate exists can offset IVIE. For real estate owned in a European Union (EU) member state and in a country which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) that has an exchange of information agreement with Italy, the wealth tax is based on the cadastral value in force in the foreign country. In instances where there is a lack of cadastral value, the wealth tax is based on the purchase cost of the property resulting or the market value in force where the real estate is located. No IVIE is due if the tax is lower than EUR 200; otherwise, the entire IVIE amount is due. If the real estate properties are subject to a property tax in the country in which they are located, the individual can deduct the amount paid from the tax due in the Italian tax return.
* Another tax, &quot;Imposta sul valore delle Attivita` Finanziarie detenute all` Estero&quot; or &quot;IVAFE&quot;, is 0.20% and is levied on all financial assets located outside the country, including, so far as the language seems to imply, individual pension schemes such as 401(k)s and IRAs in the US.

==== Netherlands ====
There is a tax called &quot;vermogensrendementheffing&quot;. Although its name (&quot;wealth yield tax&quot;) suggests that it is a tax on the &quot;yield&quot; of wealth, it qualifies as a wealth tax, since the actual yield (whether positive or negative) is not taken into account in its calculation. Up to and including 2016, the rate was fixed at 1.2% (30% taxation over an assumed yield of 4%). From the fiscal year of 2017 onwards, the tax rate progresses with wealth. See Income tax in the Netherlands. In addition to the &quot;vermogensrendementheffing&quot;, owners of real estate pay a tax called &quot;onroerendezaakbelasting&quot;, which is based on the estimated value of the real estate they own. This is a local tax, levied by the city council where the property is located.

==== Norway ====
0.7% (municipal) and 0.15% (national) a total of 0.85% levied on net assets exceeding 1,500,000 kr (approx. ) as of 2019. For tax purposes, the value of the primary residence is valued to 25% of the market value, secondary residences to 90% of the market value, while working capital such as commercial real estate, stocks, and stock funds are valued at various percentages. The Conservative Party, Progress Party and the Liberal Party have stated that they aim to reduce and eventually eliminate the wealth tax.

==== Spain ====
There is a tax called &quot;Patrimonio&quot;. The tax rate is progressive, from 0.2 to 3.75% of net assets above the threshold of €700,000 after €300,000 primary residence allowance. The exact amount varies between regions.

==== Switzerland ====
A progressive wealth tax that varies by residence location. Most cantons have no wealth tax for individual net worth less than (approx. ) and progressively raise the tax rate on net assets with a top rate ranging from 0.13% to 0.94% depending on canton and municipality of residence. Wealth tax is levied against worldwide assets of Swiss residents, but it is not levied against assets in Switzerland held by non-residents.

Swiss wealth tax is regulated on a cantonal basis. All cantons levy a net wealth tax based on the balance of the worldwide gross assets minus debts, and tax rates can vary depending on the taxpayer&#x27;s residency, with maximum rates varying from around 0.13% to 1.1%.

===Historical examples===
Ancient Athens had a wealth tax called eisphora (see symmoria), and a wealth registry consisting of self-assessments (τίμημα), limited to the wealthiest. The registry was not very accurate.

The religion of Islam has a concept sometimes described as a wealth tax called Zakat.

Iceland had a wealth tax until 2006 and a temporary wealth tax reintroduced in 2010 for four years. The tax was levied at a rate of 1.5% on net assets exceeding 75,000,000 kr for individuals and 100,000,000 kr for married couples.

Similar to Iceland, Denmark taxed household income above a certain exemption threshold, which was about the 98th percentile of the wealth distribution, until 1997. A dozen OECD countries imposed similar taxes until the 1990s, but the Danish wealth tax was the highest of its kind. Until the late 1980s, the marginal tax rate on wealth was 2.2 percent, leading to a very high rate on the return on wealth. After minimizing the tax for some years, the Danish government eventually abolished the tax altogether in 1997.

Some other European countries have discontinued this kind of tax in recent years: Germany (1997), Finland (2006), Luxembourg (2006) and Sweden (2007).

In the United Kingdom and other countries, property (real estate) is often a person&#x27;s main asset, and has been taxed – for example, the window tax of 1696, the rates, to some extent the Council Tax.

===Proposed examples===

==== Germany ====
In order to bridge the wealth gap between rich and poor in Germany, the Social Democratic Party of Germany called for a nationwide wealth tax to be reintroduced in 2019. According to the proposed tax reform, wealthy households would be required to pay an extra tax between 1% and 1.5%. A single household would need to pay 1% of their net worth on every euro surpassing €2 Million and married couple would have to pay for every euro surpassing €4 Million. A married household with a combined net worth of €4.2 Million would have to pay an annual wealth tax of €2,000. The proposition was eventually vetoed by the CDU/CSU and therefore never again considered.

==Concentration of wealth==

In 2014, French economist Thomas Piketty published a widely discussed book entitled &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; that starts with the observation that economic inequality is increasing and proposes wealth taxes as a countermeasure. Piketty proposes a global system of progressive wealth taxes to help reduce inequality and avoid the trend towards a vast majority of wealth coming under the control of a tiny minority. This analysis was hailed as a major and important work by some economists. Other economists have challenged Piketty&#x27;s proposals and interpretations.

=== France ===
In 2017, when introducing the fiscal reform of the solidarity wealth tax, the government of the French president Emmanuel Macron used the first argument of capital flight. The other argument stated by the comity of evaluation of reforms on wealth fiscalism was that the previous wealth tax was not enough progressive for the top 0.1% wealthier.
The “IFI” as the “ISF” are wealth tax thus they concerned high earners. A big part of people paying this tax are in the ninth decile of income distribution and the “IFI” represents one over two household in the wealthiest 0.01%. Therefore, in the general tax system, the “IFI” contributes, as did the ISF, to make the tax system more progressive. But this progressivity has limits: “the IFI represents on average 0.1% of income around the ninth decile and 1.2% of income of 0.1% of very well-off households in 2018. While the income tax rate under the ISF was stable overall, within the top 0.1% of income, the income tax rate under of the IFI declines for the wealthiest and falls to 0.6% for the top 0.01%.”
Broadly, this reform largely benefits to the 0.1% wealthier and did not make this wealth tax more progressive as it was supposed to be. In fact, it reduced the number of accountable people of wealth tax leaving the country but in term of investment, the gains of this reforms has been traduced in an increasing of dividend on capital earnings (37.4 billion from non-financial society had been paid) and not on direct investment on corporate (see “Capital flight”). In average and from different studies, those fiscal reforms benefited more to top-wealthier households. For Ben Jelloul and al. (2019), the reforms benefit for the top 1% more wealthier household with +5.5 point of disposable revenue. For Madec and al. (2019) it had affected on the top 2% of the wealthier households and for Pasquier and Sicsic (2019), the 5% of the top distribution perceived 57% of the gain of the fiscal reform.

==Revenue==
Revenue from a wealth tax scheme depends largely on the presence of net wealth and wealth inequality within the target country. Revenue depends on the plan that is in place, but it generally can be modeled as formula_1, where t represents the tax rate and w is the amount of wealth affected by that tax rate. Many plans include tax brackets, where a certain portion of the individual&#x27;s wealth will be taxed at a given rate and any wealth beyond that amount will be taxed at a different rate.

A small number of countries have been using wealth tax regimes for some time. Revenues earned from wealth tax schemes vary by country from 0.98% of GDP in Switzerland to 0.22% in France, for example. 2020 United States presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren claimed a wealth tax plan could generate 1.4% of GDP in revenue for the United States.

According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the revenues generated from wealth taxes account for about 0.46% of all tax revenue on average in 2018 for countries which have wealth tax schemes in place. However this varies from country to country, the highest would be that of Luxembourg where it accounted for 7.18% of total tax revenue in 2018, the lowest would be Germany where it accounted for 0.03% of total tax revenue in 2018.
Estimates for a wealth tax&#x27;s potential revenue in the United States vary. Several Democratic presidential candidates in the 2020 election have proposed wealth tax plans. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has proposed a wealth tax of 2% on net wealth above and 6% above . The conservative-leaning nonprofit Tax Foundation estimates revenue generated by Senator Warren&#x27;s proposal would total around over the next 10 years. Separate estimates from campaign advisors and economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman put the revenue at about 1% of GDP per year, in alignment with USD revenue estimates. These estimates put Senator Warren&#x27;s tax plan revenues at about in 2020. The sum of United States tax revenues in 2018 were in 2018, meaning the tax collected by this plan would be equal to 4% of current tax revenues. Additionally, the Tax Foundation estimates 2020 presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27; wealth tax plan would collect between 2020 and 2029.

Previous proposals for a wealth tax in the United States had already existed. Eileen Myles proposed a net assets tax in her presidential campaign in 1992, as did Donald Trump during his presidential campaign in 2000.

A net wealth tax may also be designed to be revenue-neutral if it is used to broaden the tax base, stabilize the economy, and reduce individual income and other taxes.

==Effect on investment==

A wealth tax serves as a (&quot;use it or lose it&quot;), which incentivizes the productive use of assets (rather than letting assets accumulate without being used). According to University of Pennsylvania Law School professors David Shakow and Reed Shuldiner, &quot;a wealth tax also taxes capital that is not productively employed. Thus, a wealth tax can be viewed as a tax on potential income from capital.&quot; Net wealth taxes can complement rather than replace gift taxes, capital gains taxes, and inheritance taxes to increase administrability and the effectiveness of enforcement efforts.

In their article, &quot;Investment Effects of Wealth Taxes Under Uncertainty and Irreversibility,&quot; Rainer Niemann and Caren Sureth-Sloane found that the effects of wealth taxation on investment mainly depends upon the tax method employed and the broadness of the wealth threshold for taxation. Niemann and Sureth-Sloane found that, &quot;Broadening the wealth tax base tends to accelerate investment during high interest rate periods.&quot; Caren Sureth and Ralf Maiterth concluded that wealth tax revenues from entrepreneurs may decrease in the long term and the revenue from a wealth tax may be negative if the wealth taxation thresholds are too low.

Saez and Zucman are two economists that worked on the &quot;Ultra-Millionaire Tax&quot; proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren. In their paper, &quot;Progressive Wealth Taxation,&quot; they assert that a potential wealth tax in the United States needs necessary parameters to limit detrimental effects on investment. One parameter is a high wealth threshold to limit direct taxation on small business and entrepreneurship. The academic literature on the effects of wealth taxation on investment incentives are inconclusive in the United States; Saez and Zucman assert there are three reasons wealth taxes in European countries are weak comparisons to the United States when analyzing potential effects on investment. First, they claim tax competition between European countries allows for individuals to avoid taxation by allocating assets to a different country. Reallocating assets to avoid taxation is more difficult in the United States because tax filings apply equally to United States citizens no matter the country of current residence. Second, low exemption thresholds caused liquidity problems for some individuals who were on the lower end of wealth taxation thresholds. Third, they contend European wealth taxes need modernization and improved methods for systematic information gathering.

Saez and Zucman have also argued that a wealth tax with a high threshold, would have the benefit of mainly targeting individuals who have a high degree of liquid assets, circumventing the liquidity problem of small and medium sized businesses and less wealthy individuals. Moreover, they argue that such a tax would not necessarily reduce innovation since innovation is mostly done by young people who haven&#x27;t acquired a big fortune yet. This must be seen in the context that most of the wealthiest people in the US are older than average. Additionally, they argue that large established businesses use some of their wealth to retain market power, reducing innovation and competition. Therefore, a wealth tax with a high tax payable threshold could potentially increase innovation.

Further proponents for a wealth tax claim it could have positive effects on investment in the United States. Some extremely wealthy people use their assets in unproductive ways. For example, an entrepreneur could generate much higher returns (though could conversely lose much more capital operating on leverage) than a wealthy individual with a conservative investment such as United States Treasury Bonds.
A wealth tax could lead to negative effects on investment, saving, and economic growth. In the article, &quot;Economic effects of wealth taxation,&quot; Kyle Pomerleau states, &quot;A wealth tax, even levied at an apparently low annual rate, places a significant burden on saving.&quot; The degree of this impact on savings and investments is reliant on the openness of the United States economy. A wealth tax would shrink national saving and increase foreign ownership of assets. The potential decrease in national savings leads to a decrease in capital stock. An estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model indicates that if the revenue from the wealth tax proposed by Elizabeth Warren were used to finance non-productive government spending, GDP would decrease by 2.1 percent by 2050, capital stock would decrease by 6.5 percent, and wages would decrease by 2.3 percent. Some opponents also point out that redistribution through a wealth tax is an inherently counterintuitive way to foster economic growth. Richard Epstein, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, contents, &quot;The classical liberal approach wants to simplify taxation and reduce regulation to spur growth. Plain old growth is a much better social tonic that the toxic Warren Wealth Tax.&quot;

==Criticisms==

There are many arguments against the implementation of a wealth tax, including claims that a wealth tax would be unconstitutional (in the United States), that property would be too hard to value, and that wealth taxes would reduce the rate of innovation.

===Capital flight===

A 2006 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; titled &quot;Old Money, New Money Flee France and Its Wealth Tax&quot; pointed out some of the harm caused by France&#x27;s wealth tax. The article gave examples of how the tax caused capital flight, brain drain, loss of jobs, and, ultimately, a net loss in tax revenue. Among other things, the article stated, &quot;Éric Pichet, author of a French tax guide, estimates the wealth tax earns the government about a year but has cost the country more than in capital flight since 1998.&quot;

In fact the wealth tax named &quot;Impôt sur les Grandes Fortunes&quot; (IGF) [&quot;tax on great wealth&quot;] had been created in 1980, then suppressed in 1986 before finally being reintroduced in 1988 under the name “Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune” (ISF) &quot;solidarity tax on wealth&quot;. In 1999 a new higher tax category was added which increased the money collected from 0.09% of GDP in 1990 to 0.16% in 2004.

For example, in 2003, 370 ISF’s accountables people left France and it continued to grow year by year except between 2010 and 2011 when the tax threshold has been raised and accountable people were discarded from it. This capital flight only decrease after 2015 and in 2017 when the French government announced that it will suppress this tax. After the reforms implementation, there were only 163 departures of wealth tax people in 2018. The capital flight was one of the argument to reforms the wealth tax. After 2017, in the financial law of 2018, the new wealth tax was introduced with other tax reforms. The fiscal reform thus included a unique forfeit tax on saving, combined with the replacement of ISF by the IFI “Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière” (IFI) which reduce the wealth tax to real-estate property only and finally a decrease of the corporate tax. This argument of capital flight takes its roots on an economic theory, the runoff theory. By decreasing the wealth tax, the wealth households are supposed to come back inside the country to invest and thus raised the GDP growth which will have effect on all the population by reducing unemployment and boost the economy. In France, the fiscal reform did not have the expected effects of runoff. In fact, the capital flight due to wealth tax household leaving only represented 0.3% and 0.5% of the total amount of money collected by the solidarity tax on wealth, between 2004 and 2015. On the other hand, this decrease of the wealth tax represented an income loss of 2.9 billion for the state.

In term of investment, there were fewer investments in real-estate from people accountable of wealth tax. However, this movement could be explained more by the increase in household income, the low level of interest rates on mortgage loans and the general dynamics of the real estate market than by a sale, on the part of wealthy households, of property subject to the IFI for the benefit of investments in transferable securities, therefore the result in investment on corporate are not significant. Moreover, the fiscal reform on wealth tax had an insignificant level at the macroeconomic level for the corporate funds. For example, in 2020 for the non-financial society, the part of listed and non-listed share has been lower from the average of the previous period 2001-2019. It is also hard to measure the effect on corporate investment because of the Covid-19 crises which caused a shut-down of the economy in 2020.

===Valuation issues===

In 2012, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that: &quot;the wealth tax has a fatal flaw: valuation. It has been estimated that 62% of the wealth of the top 1% is &quot;non-financial&quot; – i.e., vehicles, real estate, and (most importantly) private business. Private businesses account for nearly 40% of their wealth and are the largest single category.&quot; A particular issue for small business owners is that they cannot accurately value their private business until it is sold. Furthermore, business owners could easily make their businesses look much less valuable than they really are, through accounting, valuations and assumptions about the future. &quot;Even the rich don&#x27;t know exactly what they&#x27;re worth in any given moment.&quot;

Examples of such fraud and malfeasance were revealed in 2013, when French budget minister Jérôme Cahuzac was discovered shifting financial assets into Swiss bank accounts in order to avoid the wealth tax. After further investigation, a French finance ministry official said, &quot;A number of government officials minimised their wealth, by negligence or with intent, but without exceeding 5–10 per cent of their real worth ... however, there are some who have deliberately tried to deceive the authorities.&quot; Yet again, in October 2014, France&#x27;s Finance chairman and President of the National Assembly, Gilles Carrez, was found to have avoided paying the French wealth tax (ISF) for three years by applying a 30 percent tax allowance on one of his homes. However, he had previously converted the home into an SCI, a private, limited company to be used for rental purposes. The 30 percent allowance does not apply to SCI holdings. Once this was revealed, Carrez declared, &quot;if the tax authorities think that I should pay the wealth tax, I won&#x27;t argue.&quot; Carrez is one of more than 60 French parliamentarians battling with the tax offices over &#x27;dodgy&#x27; asset declarations.

Moreover, this problem of wealth devaluation is undermined by the administration itself. For example, in France in 1999, the government introduced the notion of “the measured application of the tax law”. But this application of the law is mostly reserved for the self-declared tax, like the wealth tax. It means that if there is a fraud in the declaration, there will be no sanction if the household concerned correct his mistake, even if it might have been done in purpose.
This flexibility granted to self-declared taxes is indeed unequal. In fact the other tax that concerned most of the households, like income taxes, cannot be self-declared and this fraud flexibility benefits only to the richer household. More broadly, this self-declaration tax has developed what the sociologist Alexis Spire called “tax law domestication”, which enables the richest part of the population to employ fiscal specialists to optimize its declarations and minimize the amount of the wealth tax. Once again this creates an opportunity of optimization, as the flexibility in sanctions is unequally distributed in the tax spectrum and thus in the different parts of the population.

===Social effects===

Opponents of wealth taxes have argued that there is &quot;an undercurrent of envy in the campaign against extremes of wealth.&quot; Two Yale University/London School of Economics studies (2006, 2008) on relative income yielded results asserting that 50 percent of the public would prefer to earn less money, as long as they earned as much or more than their neighbor.

Many analysts and scholars assert that since wealth taxes are a form of direct asset collection, as well as double-taxation, they are antithetical to personal freedom and individual liberty. They further contend that free nations should have no business helping themselves arbitrarily to the personal belongings of any group of its citizens. Further, these opponents may say wealth taxes place the authority of the government ahead of the rights of the individual, and ultimately undermine the concept of personal sovereignty. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; editor Allister Heath critically described wealth taxes as Marxian in concept and ethically destructive to the values of democracies, &quot;Taxing already acquired property drastically alters the relationship between citizen and state: we become leaseholders, rather than freeholders, with accumulated taxes over long periods of time eventually &quot;returning&quot; our wealth to the state. It breaches a key principle that has made this country great: the gradual expansion of property ownership and the democratisation of wealth.&quot;

==Past repeals==

In 2004, a study by the Institut de l&#x27;enterprise investigated why several European countries were eliminating wealth taxes and made the following observations: 1. Wealth taxes contributed to capital drain, promoting the flight of capital as well as discouraging investors from coming in. 2. Wealth taxes had high management cost and relatively low returns. 3. Wealth taxes distorted resource allocation, particularly involving certain exemptions and unequal valuation of assets. In its summary, the institute found that the &quot;wealth taxes were not as equitable as they appeared&quot;.

In a 2011 study, the London School of Economics examined wealth taxes that were being considered by the Labour party in the United Kingdom between 1974 and 1976 but were ultimately abandoned. The findings of the study revealed that the British evaluated similar programs in other countries and determined that the Spanish wealth tax may have contributed to a banking crisis and the French wealth tax had been undergoing review by its government for being unpopular and overly complex. As efforts progressed, concerns were developing over the practicality and implementation of wealth taxes as well as worry that they would undermine confidence in the British economy. Eventually, plans were dropped. Former British Chancellor Denis Healey concluded that attempting to implement wealth taxes was a mistake, &quot;We had committed ourselves to a Wealth Tax: but in five years I found it impossible to draft one which would yield enough revenue to be worth the administrative cost and political hassle.&quot; The conclusion of the study stated that there were lingering questions, such as the impacts on personal saving and small business investment, consequences of capital flight, complexity of implementation, and ability to raise predicted revenues that must be adequately addressed before further consideration of wealth taxes.

==Legal impediments==

===United States===
: &quot;See also&quot; Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.; &quot;Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution&quot;

In part because a wealth tax has never been implemented in the United States, there is no legal consensus about its constitutionality. As evidenced below, much scholarly debate on the topic hinges on whether or not such a tax is understood to be a &quot;direct tax,&quot; per Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which requires that the burden of &quot;direct taxes&quot; be apportioned across the states by their population.

Barry L. Isaacs interprets current case law in the United States to hold that a wealth tax is a direct tax under Article 1, Section 9. Given the extreme difficulty of apportioning a wealth tax by state population, the implementation of a wealth tax in the United States would require either a constitutional amendment or the overturning of current case law. Unlike federal wealth taxes, states and localities are not bound by Article 1, Section 9, which is why they are able to levy taxes on real estate.

Other legal scholars have argued that a wealth tax does not represent a direct tax and that such a tax could be implemented in the United States without a constitutional amendment. In a lengthy essay from 2018, authors in the &quot;Indiana Journal of Law&quot; argued that &quot;... the belief that the U.S. Constitution effectively makes a national wealth tax impossible ... is wrong.&quot; The authors noted that in the 1796 Supreme Court decision for &quot;Hylton v. United States&quot;, Supreme Court justices who had personally taken part in the creation of the U.S. Constitution &quot;unanimously rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of an annual tax on carriages, a tax akin to a national wealth tax in that it taxed a luxury property.&quot; However, Alexander Hamilton, who supported the carriage tax, told the Supreme Court that it was constitutional because it was an &quot;excise tax&quot;, not a direct tax. Hamilton&#x27;s brief defines direct taxes as &quot;Capitation or poll taxes, taxes on lands and buildings, general assessments, whether on the whole property of individuals or on their whole real or personal estate&quot; which would include the wealth tax. Tax scholars have repeatedly noted that the critical difference between income taxes and wealth taxes, the realization requirement, is a matter of administrative convenience, not a constitutional requirement.

To prevent capital flight, proponents of wealth taxes have argued for the implementation of a one-time exit tax on high net worth individuals who renounce their citizenship and leave the country. An additional constitutional objection to such a tax could be raised on the grounds that it violates the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from taking private property for public use without just compensation.

In 2023, Texas voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting state lawmakers from imposing a wealth tax.

===Germany===

The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in Karlsruhe found that wealth taxes &quot;would need to be confiscatory in order to bring about any real redistribution&quot;. In addition, the court held that the sum of wealth tax and income tax should not be greater than half of a taxpayer&#x27;s income. &quot;The tax thus gives rise to a dilemma: either it is ineffective in fighting inequalities, or it is confiscatory – and it is for that reason that the Germans chose to eliminate it.&quot; Thus, finding such wealth taxes unconstitutional in 1995. In 2006, the Constitutional Court revised this decision on the so-called &quot;Halbteilungsgrundsatz&quot;, stating that &quot;From the property guarantee of the Basic Law, no generally binding absolute upper limit of taxation in the vicinity of a half division can be derived.&quot;

<text>Lola Violeta Ana-Maria Bobesco (9 August 1921– 4 September 2003) was a Belgian violinist of Romanian origin.

== Biography ==
She was born in Craiova, Romania, and began her career as a child prodigy, giving her first recital there at the age of 6 with her father, composer and conductor Aurel Bobesco. She continued her studies at the Ecole Normale Musique de Paris (1928–1935) with Marcel Chailley (violin), and at the Conservatoire de Paris (1931–1935) with Jules Bucher, where she gained her first prize in 1934, and graduated with the &quot;Prix d&#x27;Excellence.&quot; She took private violin lessons with George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud. She became known internationally after appearing in Paris (1936) aged 17 with the Colonne Orchestra under the baton of Paul Paray, where she performed a concerto by Romanian composer Stan Golestan. The following year, 1937, she obtained the seventh prize at the Eugène Ysaÿe contest.

Although established abroad even before the end of World War II, she returned to Romania and regularly appeared in concerts with the Radio Philharmonic in Bucharest, and the provinces in Craiova, Brasov, Iasi, Timișoara.

She founded two musical groups in Belgium: in 1958, the Orchestre Royal de Chambre de Wallonie in Liège; and in 1990, the string quartet L&#x27;Arte del Suono in Brussels.

She was also a professor at the French-language &quot;Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles&quot; and professor of violin at the Conservatory of Liège (1962–1974). She was on the jury of the Queen Elizabeth Competition in 1971 and 1993. She recorded sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, Gabriel Fauré, Johannes Brahms, César Franck and Claude Debussy, and also baroque music including concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach. She also worked with major orchestral ensembles of the world, including: Berlin and London Philharmonics, French orchestra Colonne, Lamoureux and Pas de loup, Concertgebouw Orchestra (Amsterdam), La Suisse Romande (Geneva), and the Orchestra Accademia Santa Cecilia (Rome). At concert and chamber music recitals, she was often accompanied by pianist Jacques Genty.

A violinist of exceptional artistic force in spite of her delicate physique, Bobesco balanced technical virtuosity with simplicity and interpretative austerity. Purity of lyrical expression, clear intonation, warm communicative musical phrasing, and originality of conception put her among the top international female performers. She recorded for Decca, Columbia, Les Discophiles Français, Nippon Program Arcophon, and others.

She died in Spa, Belgium.

Her violin was attributed to G.B Guadagnini.

The street &#x27;Rue Lola Bobesco&#x27; that encircles behind the cultural centre at the Brussels commune of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, is named after her.

<doc id="1139187" wikidata="Q1638586" url="?curid=1139187" title="Hurricane Faith">
<text>Hurricane Faith was a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane and was the sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season. Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23. Over the next several days, the storm treked north of the Lesser Antilles, weakening into a tropical storm on August 26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale-force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.

On August 27, the storm reached hurricane status again, and the next day, the storm further intensified into a major hurricane after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. The next day, the storm weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane and began re-curving to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained hurricane intensity for several days, while tracking east of the United States. On September 3, Faith reattained major hurricane status as it underwent extratropical transition, reaching peak winds of . Faith weakened as it completed extratropical transition, finally losing tropical characteristics while east of Atlantic Canada. The system continued traversing the Atlantic Ocean for several days, finally dissipating on September 15, while located just north of Franz Josef Land. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm.

==Meteorological history==
Television Infrared Observation Satellite XI (TIROS XI) imagery indicated the presence of an area of disturbed weather over Ivory Coast on August 18. The system moved slowly westward and eventually reached the Atlantic Ocean. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 0000 UTC on August 21, while located about southeast of Cape Verde. Continuing westward, the depression intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Gradual intensification persisted as Tropical Storm Faith headed nearly due westward at . By August 23, Faith was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Curving slightly west-northwestward, the storm reached Category 2 intensity and briefly peaked at sustained winds of . Hurricane Faith curved to the northwest and weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane while approaching the northeastern Leeward Islands on August 25. Initially, Faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of Project Stormfury. However, the scheduled seeding was cancelled as Faith was approaching The Bahamas. Bypassing the Leeward Islands, Faith remained at nearly the same intensity, until re-strengthening into Category 2 hurricane on August 28, near Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm quickly intensified further into a Category 3 hurricane only six hours later.
At 00:00 UTC on August 29, Faith attained its maximum sustained winds of . After reaching maximum sustained winds late on August 29, Faith began to gradually weaken and decreased to Category 2 hurricane intensity early on August 30. By that time, the storm turned to the northeast around the periphery of an Atlantic subtropical anticyclone while located about midway between Bermuda and Florida. Faith remained well offshore of the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada, after veering eastward on September 1. Thereafter, it began to accelerate and eventually curved northeastward. While approaching Europe, Faith&#x27;s forward speed increased to as much as . At 0600 UTC on September 3, a minimum barometric pressure of was recorded – the lowest in relation to the storm.
On Sept 4th, Faith transitioned into an extratropical storm retaining category 2 equivalent winds.
It continued to weaken as it neared the Faroe Islands and crossed the North Sea. The extratropical remnants of Faith headed eastward and affected Norway with winds as high as . Tracking over Scandinavia, the extratropical storm weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression before entering the Soviet Union (present day Russia). Eventually, the storm degenerated into an extratropical low pressure area, curved northward, and retained its identity until September 15, when it was over Franz Josef Land, which is roughly from the North Pole.

==Impact==

In the Leeward Islands, the approach of Faith caused the tracking station on Antigua – which was monitoring an unmanned rocket launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) – to shut down 45 minutes after the rocket lifted off. Faith also produced gale-force winds across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, though only minor damage and no fatalities or injuries were reported. Further south, Faith brought rough seas to Trinidad and Tobago, with waves ranging from . These conditions inflicted minor damage to small boats and jetties. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, sea defenses suffered some damage as Faith passed about to the east-northeast. Along the East Coast of the United States, the storm produced rough seas and high tides from Cape Canaveral (then Cape Kennedy), Florida, to the Virginia Capes. Additionally, the Weather Bureau warned of possible gale-force winds in The Carolinas and Virginia, but also noted that the area would only experience fringe effects from the storm. In Bermuda, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Faith produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to .

Five people died as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land. Rough seas in the western Atlantic battered the &quot;Alberto Benati&quot;, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated. A 2,726 ton Norwegian car ferry known as &quot;Skagerak&quot; began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144 passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hjørring, Denmark, however one person later died in the hospital. In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fjærland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith.

<text>&quot;Floorfiller&quot; is a song by Swedish pop group A-Teens. It was released on 5 July 2002 in the United States as the second single from their third studio album, &quot;Pop &#x27;til You Drop!&quot;. It was later released on 14 October 2002 in Europe as the first single from the European reissue of &quot;Pop &#x27;til You Drop&quot;, &quot;New Arrival&quot;. The track was written by Grizzly, Tysper and Mack, who had previously worked with the group on several songs on their second studio album, &quot;Teen Spirit&quot;.

==Music video==
The Sanaa Hamri directed video was filmed at the Loft, a club in Los Angeles. The A-Teens participated in the creation of the concept for the video. The video was choreographed by Charles Klapow, who would later be the choreographer for the 2006 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;High School Musical&quot;.

<doc id="1139195" wikidata="Q1129989" url="?curid=1139195" title="Nuba Mountains">
<text>The Nuba Mountains (), also referred to as the Nuba Hills, are an area located in South Kordofan, Sudan. The area is home to a group of indigenous ethnic groups known collectively as the Nuba peoples. They are not the same as the Nubians who are indigenous to north Sudan. Rather their name is derived from the name of the mountains, “Nuba”. In the Middle Ages, the Nuba mountains had been part of the Nubian kingdom of Alodia. In the 18th century, they became home to the kingdom of Taqali that controlled the hills of the mountains until their defeat by Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad. After the British defeated the Mahdi army, Taqali was restored as a client state. Infiltration of the Messiria tribe and Muraheleen of Baggara Arabs has been influential in modern conflicts. Up to 1.5 million people live in the mountains, mostly ethnic Nuba, with a small minority of Baggara.

==Geography==
The mountains cover an area roughly 64km wide by 145km long (40 by 90 miles), and are higher in elevation than the surrounding plain. The mountains stretch for some 48,000 square kilometers (19,000 square miles). The climate is lush and green compared with most nearby areas — typically hot semi-arid with a rainy season extending from mid-May to mid-October, and annual rainfall between — allowing grazing animals and seasonal rain-fed agriculture. At the end of the dry season from February to May there is often a shortage of water. There are almost no roads in the Nuba Mountains — most villages there are connected by ancient paths that cannot be reached by motor vehicle.

===Geology===
On a grand scale the rocks of the Nuba Mountains form part of the southwestern fringe of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The Nuba Mountains are made up chiefly of metamorphic rock of Precambrian age plus some scattered areas of igneous rock of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic age. Surrounding the area of the Nuba Mountains as a sea lies a vast area of Cenozoic-aged sedimentary rock known as the &quot;Umm Rawaba sediments&quot;. In the Nuba Mountains there are phosphate deposits hosting much uranium, vanadium and phosphorus which may be of economic interest.

The largest mountains or hills are found in the central area of the Nuba Mountains, and these are inselbergs. These inselbergs are mostly made up of igneous rock, as metamorphic rock has been more heavily eroded and thus occupies lower ground.

==Political status==
The region stayed under the control of the central government and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement did not give the Nuba Mountains the right to join South Sudan in its vote for independence in 2011. Residents of the Nuba Mountains were required to hold ill-defined &quot;popular consultations&quot; to determine their future. Not only the Nuba Mountains but the whole of South Kordofan state would be eligible to vote, essentially to accommodate the Messiria. Additionally, the Sudanese government maintained a heavy military presence in the region and even prospective &quot;popular consultations&quot; were seen likely to be barred. The ambiguous situation and fears of future communal violence invoked concerns that South Kordofan could be the &quot;next Darfur&quot;.

As of June 2011, South Kordofan&#x27;s governor Ahmed Haroun had suspended the process of popular consultations and conflict between Sudan People&#x27;s Armed Forces and Nuba fighters of the SPLM-N followed (see Sudan–SPLM-N conflict (2011)).

The war in Sudan began in 1983 until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed on 9 January 2005 with independence vote set for 9 July 2011-the vote on 9 July 2011 succeeded the south into Africa&#x27;s newest country, the Republic of South Sudan. The capital is located in Juba. The Nuba Mountains are geographically in the north in the area called South Kordofan (see Wikipedia for in-depth review). The people of the Nuba Mountains (a five mountain chain rising from the desert to 1,000 metres (3,000 feet)) were not aligned with the north under sharia law nor the Arabic language. This cultural dispute was in part the reason for people in Nuba being prosecuted by indiscriminate bombing, attacks on civilians and mines at entry points to the Nuba Mountains. Samuel Totten described the campaign of the Sudanese government in the Nuba Mountains as a &quot;genocide by attrition&quot; using starvation as a tool of extermination. In 2002, due to the extreme starvation of the people of the Nuba Mountains and under the international pressure from the UN, Khartoum under President Bashir (at that time, the government was termed the National Islamic Front) authorizes an interim cease fire to provide food and medical equipment/support to the people of the Nuba Mountains. In exchange, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/SPLA agree not attack the south-north pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. An international group of observers/advisers deployed to South Kordofan Province/Kadugli with several US advisers deployed directly into the Nuba Mountains, specifically to be co-located with the SPLA. One of the advisers/observers was Randolph Hampton (US) located in Kauda co-located with the SPLA command element. Reports of indiscriminate bombing of civilians and mining entry points primarily for relief operation was reported and documents (with photos) during this time. Abdel Aziz Adam El Hilu was at that time, the governor of the Nuba Mountains and former military leader for the SPLA. He is currently (as of March 2012) back in the Nuba Mountains supporting relief and security operations.

The international community, including a number of celebrities such as actor George Clooney and reporter Nicholas Kristof, in 2015 travelled to the Nuba Mountains and documented the continued genocidal activities of the Bashir government. President Bashir is an indicted war criminal at the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a result of the genocidal activities of Sudan in Darfur. Human Rights Watch says that cluster bombs are used in the region.

The ongoing war continues as the international community continues to debate a resolution to the issue of the Nuba Mountains.

As of 2025 in the course of the civil war, most of the state including the largest city of Kologi are controlled by the secular free-market democrats under al-Hilu.

<doc id="1139199" wikidata="Q1090843" url="?curid=1139199" title="Prince Charming">
<text>Prince Charming is a fairy tale stock character who comes to the rescue of a damsel in distress and must engage in a quest to liberate her from an evil spell. This classification suits most heroes of a number of traditional folk tales, including &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, even if in the original story they were given another name, or no name at all.

Elements of the Prince Charming character date at least back to Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, published in 1697. Often handsome and romantic, these characters are essentially interchangeable, serving as a foil to the heroine; in many variants, they can be viewed as a metaphor for a reward the heroine achieves for the decisions she makes. The prominence of the character type makes him an obvious target for revisionist fairy tales. &quot;Prince Charming&quot; is also used as a term to refer to the idealized man some people dream of as a future spouse.

==History of term==

Charles Perrault&#x27;s version of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, published in 1697, includes the following text at the point where the princess wakes up: &quot;&#x27;Est-ce vous, mon prince? lui dit-elle; vous vous êtes bien fait attendre.&#x27; Le prince, charmé de ces paroles, ne savait comment lui témoigner sa joie et sa reconnaissance.&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Is it you, my Prince?&#x27; she said; &#x27;You have waited a long while.&#x27; The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude.&quot;) It has sometimes been suggested that this passage later inspired the term, &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, even though it is the prince who is charmed (&quot;charmé&quot;) here, not who is being charming (&quot;charmant&quot;).

In the 17th century, Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy wrote two fairy tales, &quot;The Story of Pretty Goldilocks&quot;, where the hero was named &quot;Avenant&quot; (&quot;Fine&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, in French), and &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, where the hero was &quot;Le roi Charmant&quot; (&quot;The Charming King&quot;). When Andrew Lang retold the first (in 1889) for &quot;The Blue Fairy Book&quot;, he rendered the hero&#x27;s name as &quot;Charming&quot;; the second, for &quot;The Green Fairy Book&quot;, as &quot;King Charming&quot;. Although neither one was a prince and the first was not royal, this may have been the original use of &quot;Charming&quot;.
In the early Disney animated feature, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), when Snow White tells the dwarfs about her prince, she says, &quot;Anyone could see that the prince was charming, the only one for me.&quot; However, he is never referred to specifically as &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. Andreas Deja initially struggled with the concept of animating a handsome villain in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Deja ultimately based Gaston&#x27;s appearance on those of handsome soap opera actors in order to create a grotesque version of the Prince Charming stock character.

In other languages, like Spanish and Italian, he is called the &quot;Blue Prince&quot;. In Portuguese, a translation mistake occurred and he is called &quot;Charmed Prince&quot; (&quot;Príncipe Encantado&quot;; the correct term for &quot;Charming&quot; should be &quot;Encantador&quot; or &quot;Charmoso&quot;), coincidentally closer to the sense in Perrault&#x27;s story mentioned atop this section.

==Modern usage==

*The Broadway musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (first produced in 1986) explores the character as lecherous, and where there are not one, but two Prince Charmings. Here, they are shown as brothers pursuing Cinderella and Rapunzel, then later, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, after they have married their first wenches. Cinderella&#x27;s Prince has an affair with the Baker’s wife as well, and when confronted about his womanizing, states &quot;I was raised to be charming, not sincere.&quot; The princes are portrayed by Robert Westenberg and Chuck Wagner in the original Broadway cast and by Gavin Creel and Joshua Henry in the original 2022 Broadway revival cast, Andy Karl played both princes for limited runs in the revival and Cheyenne Jackson played Cinderella&#x27;s Prince for a limited run as well. In the 2014 Disney film adaptation of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, the Prince Charmings are portrayed by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen.
* As implied by the title, the 1991 fantasy novel &quot;Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming&quot; by Roger Zelazny and Robert Sheckley includes sharp satire of the traditional fairy tale theme.
*Prince Charming is a prominent character in the &quot;Fables&quot; comic book (2002–2015). Polygamy is explored again: in that version, he successively married Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella with each marriage ending in divorce due to his compulsive womanizing. He himself comments: &quot;I always truly love a woman when I first pursue her...I&#x27;m just no good at the happily-ever-after part.&quot; He parlays his charm into election as the mayor of Fabletown, the underground &quot;Fable&quot; community, and finds the job more difficult than he had anticipated. He died in the Battle for the Homelands by activating a bomb to End the War.
*The character of Prince Charming is deconstructed in the 2004 movie &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and its 2007 follow-up &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, wherein he is the son of the Fairy Godmother and has an unpleasant and ruthless personality unfitting for a fairy-tale prince.
*In the fantasy novel series &quot;The Sisters Grimm&quot; (2005–2012), Prince Charming is the mayor of Ferryport Landing, a town inhabited by fairy-tale characters- or &quot;everafters&quot;. He is shown to be rude, arrogant and boastful, but turns out to be a valuable ally to the protagonists of the series. He is shown to have married and slept with many of the girls in this town, among them Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. But he clarifies that he truly loves Snow White and proposes to her. He then separates himself from her for her protection.
*The concept of the Prince Charming is parodied in the 2007 film &quot;Enchanted&quot; when Edward is looking for Princess Giselle in the New York City. While knocking the doors he finds a pregnant housewife holding three kids, who tells him, in a scoffing voice, &quot;You&#x27;re too late.&quot;
*In the television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (2011–2017), Prince Charming (portrayed by Josh Dallas) is the husband of Snow White, though neither of them remembers this in the cursed Storybrooke, where the character&#x27;s name is David Nolan (&quot;Charming&quot; is the nickname given to him by Snow White). In his previous life, David is actually the brother of the real prince James (also portrayed by Josh Dallas) who died and was replaced with his twin. Both brothers were born to a poor farm couple who made a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to save their farm; they gave up one son to King George, whose wife could not conceive. After James&#x27;s death his brother found out the truth and took his place, becoming engaged to Abigail, daughter of King Midas (reluctantly, after his family is threatened by the real prince&#x27;s adoptive father) in a deal that unites two kingdoms with Midas giving the King George gold in exchange for the prince defeating a dragon. Later, the prince meets and marries Snow White with whom he has a daughter named Emma.

<text>The Wonderbra is a type of push-up underwire brassiere that gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s. Although the Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, the brand was developed in Canada. Moses (Moe) Nadler, founder and majority owner of the Canadian Lady Corset Company, licensed the trademark for the Canadian market in 1939. By the 1960s the Canadian Lady brand had become known in Canada as &quot;Wonderbra, the company.&quot; In 1961 the company introduced the Model 1300 plunge push-up bra. This bra became one of the best-selling Canadian styles and is virtually identical to today&#x27;s Wonderbra.

In 1968, Canadian Lady changed its name to Canadian Lady-Canadelle Inc., was sold to Consolidated Foods (now Sara Lee Corporation), and later became Canadelle Inc. During the 1970s Wonderbra was repositioned as the company&#x27;s fashionable and sexy brand, and became the Canadian market leader.

In 1991, the push-up Wonderbra became a sensation in the UK, although it had been sold there since 1964 under license by the Gossard division of Courtaulds Textiles. Sara Lee Corporation did not renew Gossard&#x27;s license and redesigned the push-up style for the reintroduction of the Wonderbra to the U.S. market in 1994.

Since 1994, the Wonderbra has expanded from the single push-up design into a full-range lingerie fashion label in most of the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products, a departure from the strategy that made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.

== Original &quot;Wonder-Bra&quot; design ==
Elastic materials were rationed and unavailable for clothes prior to the start of World War II. Israel Pilot designed an improved cup with a diagonal slash, shoulder strap attachment. This innovation on existing bra design provided more comfort and freedom of movement for the wearer. He also coined the name &quot;Wonder-Bra&quot; in 1935.

Israel Pilot&#x27;s , granted in 1941, allowed for greater shoulder strap elasticity by cutting the fabric so that the weave has the greatest stretch (cutting on the &quot;bias&quot;). The photographs show the original patent sketches and close-ups of a bra made in the U.S. by D&#x27;Amour. The model is wearing a rare 1950s version of this original Wonder-Bra design.

== History ==

In 1939, Moe Nadler founded the Canadian Lady Corset Company. He created a small sewing shop in the heart of Montreal to make a well-fitting, good quality bra in the mid-priced range (from $1.00 to $1.50 retail). As part of this effort, he travelled to New York City, met with Israel Pilot and licensed the Wonder-Bra trademark and diagonal slash patent. In Canada, the trademark lost the hyphen to become &quot;WonderBra,&quot; and &quot;Wonderbra&quot; at the U.S. reintroduction.

During the wartime years, Canadian apparel manufacturers were subject to quotas on materials. Elastics were unavailable, affecting the comfort and design of women&#x27;s underwear. The diagonal slash offered a better fitting brassiere without elastics, and became a competitive advantage.

From 1939 to 1955, Canadian Lady marketed several lines of intimate apparel including girdles, panties, slips, swimsuits, and brassieres under the Wonderbra brand. The company also created sub-brands to target different socioeconomic and lifestyle segments of the consumer market. In contrast, the U.S. market for Wonder-Bra stagnated while the brand was owned by Israel Pilot&#x27;s companies. In 1952, Canadian Lady launched Petal Burst with anticipation of tough negotiations with D&#x27;Amour—Israel Pilot&#x27;s U.S. company—around the expiration of the patent in 1955. This new line also adapted to a new fashion trend towards a pointed bust, inspired by Christian Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot;. The Petal Burst by Wonderbra line was successful and delivered 50% of bra sales by 1957.

The post-patent negotiations were led by Moe Nadler. D&#x27;Amour no longer had leverage with a patent, but still demanded that Canadian Lady stop using the designs, and return the pattern templates. Moe Nadler ignored this demand and instead successfully acquired the Canadian, European, and Asian rights to the Wonderbra trademarks. This allowed the company to move forward into the 1960s with the brand intact. By the mid-1960s Canadian Lady was exporting and licensing the Wonderbra line to Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, Israel and the West Indies. In the 1970s, Canadelle acquired the remaining worldwide rights to the trademark, and licensed Giltex (a Canadian pantyhose manufacturer acquired by Sara Lee in the 1980s) to use the Wonderbra brand on hosiery in Canada.

=== Development of the push-up bra ===
In the late 1950s Moe Nadler started travelling to Europe to find new styles to bring to the Canadian market. In 1960, Wonderbra introduced a lacy, half push-up bra described in Europe as &quot;Pigeonnant&quot; (meaning &quot;pigeon-breasted&quot; in French). In 1961 Nadler directed Louise Poirier to develop a deeply plunged, laced push-up design, numbered the 1300. Canadian Lady licensed these models, among others, to Gossard in 1964. It was the Wonderbra &quot;Dream Lift&quot; Model 1300 design that became first a UK success in the early 1990s, a European sensation in 1993, and then the &quot;One and Only Wonderbra&quot; that was finally launched in the U.S. in 1994.

=== Canadian product, 1964 to 1980 ===

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the majority of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women&#x27;s roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose and the rise of the miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.

It was against this backdrop that the Canadian Lady &quot;Corset&quot; Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women&#x27;s feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras as a means to feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady&#x27;s management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women&#x27;s wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.

Later, Larry Nadler identified an age based bifurcation in the market. Younger women (aged 15 to 20) regarded their bras as an enhancement to their sexuality but were not interested in a heavily structured garment. Nadler learned that women wanted &quot;less bra,&quot; not &quot;no bra.&quot; In 1974, they introduced a new line of brassieres for teens called Dici (by Wonderbra), and invented new hot fabric molding technologies to shape the cup. These bras were seamless and simply designed with less support than the typical bra of the period. The company designed special packaging in the shape of a die (with holes).

=== Brand development ===
In 1966, Canadian Lady made several important changes to their advertising strategy. They introduced television advertising and changed the emphasis from the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on television—girdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.

Instead of being hidden &quot;unmentionables&quot;, Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a luxury product with the highest price of any mass-merchandised brand. This strategy also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmetic—a beauty enhancer—rather than a functional garment. Playtex, the leading brand at the time, promoted the ease of care and durability of their girdles and brassieres.

Beginning in 1967, the advertising focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand brassieres. In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising to develop the new campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer (in a fashion shoot) or fashion buyer (at a fashion show). The storyline suggested an attraction or budding romance between the man and the women. The voice-over and jingle featured a man&#x27;s voice and the commercial showed an actual woman&#x27;s torso naked except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed brassieres on a manikin or a dressmaker&#x27;s dummy to promote the functional features of the product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, &quot;We care about the shape you&#x27;re in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra&quot;. The 1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.

The Dici by Wonderbra television advertisements started in 1974. The brand was positioned to young women as a more natural alternative to the heavily structured bras worn by their mothers. The animated ads featured the iconic die-shaped packaging. A bra exited the box like a bird, then metamorphosed into a seagull and flew away. The tagline reinforced a spirit of freedom and nature: &quot;Let it be Dici. Dici or nothing.&quot;

=== Popularity in Canada ===
From 1972 to 1977, the company doubled its wholesale revenue from $12.6 million to $24.9 million. By 1979 Canadelle dominated with 30% of the Canadian market and $27 million in sales. Playtex (later acquired by Sara Lee) was second. By 1980, Wonderbra&#x27;s sales were over $30 million wholesale ($76 million in 2006 dollars) in a country with only 10.3 million women and girls older than 13.

=== Worldwide reintroduction, 1991 to 1994 ===
Around 1991, Gossard was selling the Wonderbra lines under licenses that were to expire in January 1994. At the time, the plunge style was a good seller in the UK market. Gossard planned to renew their license and had an option to do so under the existing agreement. Instead of simply renewing the agreement, Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee.

Soon after the negotiations started, something unexpected happened. In 1992, the plunge style became a hit with British women and sales took off. Between 1991 and 1993, UK sales of that Wonderbra style quadrupled to $28 million, accounting for 12.5% of the $225 million UK branded bra market. Several factors might have contributed to this boom including &quot;an article in British Vogue on the return of the padded bra, a Vivienne Westwood-inspired fad for corsetry and that Gaultier driven yearning for underwear as outerwear&quot;. With this surge in sales, Sara Lee decided not to renew the license with Gossard.
In 1994 in the UK, the (Sara Lee) Wonderbra achieved a high profile for its racy &quot;Hello Boys&quot; campaign. The most famous campaign poster presented model Eva Herzigová in a Wonderbra gazing down at her breasts with the caption &quot;Hello Boys&quot;, addressing male admirers. Urban myth attributed a number of car accidents to drivers being distracted by the advertisements. The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and it was voted in at number 10 in a &quot;Poster of the Century&quot; contest.

The Playtex Division of Sara Lee was given the responsibility of introducing &quot;The Wonderbra&quot; style to the United States. Although the model was already being manufactured in Montreal by Canadelle, Playtex executives decided to take a year to redesign the bra for the U.S. market. They scheduled a late 1994 national launch for the bra. During this period, Gossard introduced to Americans their Ultrabra, with a design similar to the push-up Wonderbra model. Other competitors quickly followed while Playtex retooled the design. Victoria&#x27;s Secret launched television advertisements to maintain visibility for the Miracle Bra which the company launched in 1993.

The U.S. Wonderbra rollout included events with Eva Herzigová in New York&#x27;s Times Square. The advertisements were toned down in comparison to the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as &quot;who cares if it&#x27;s a bad hair day&quot; and &quot;look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me.&quot; The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their &quot;One and Only Wonderbra&quot;, the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.

Following the 1994 relaunch, the U.S. Wonderbra has expanded from the single push-up bra design to a broader lingerie line. The brand remains popular around the world as a product, and a part of the cultural lexicon.

=== Sale of brand to Hanes (2006) ===
In 2006, Sara Lee sold its intimate apparel brands. The Wonderbra trademark is the property of Canadelle Limited Partnership of Canada, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of HanesBrands Inc. HanesBrands Inc. owns the license to sell and distribute apparel products under the Wonderbra trademark in all countries except the member states of the European Union, several other European nations and South Africa; in these other markets, an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners owns the license under the Dim Branded Apparel group which is headquartered in Paris.

==Popularity==
On January 3, 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC-TV) broadcast the results of their internet poll, in which Canadian respondents ranked the Wonderbra 5th out of the top 50 &quot;Greatest Canadian Inventions&quot; (after Insulin, the light bulb and the telephone, but ahead of the pacemaker).

In a March 2008 survey of 3,000 UK women, the Wonderbra was reported as the greatest fashion innovation in history. According to one magazine article, survey respondents were nearly unanimous in giving push-up bras the number one position.

==Spokesmodels==
During the 1994 reintroduction, it was thought that an international group of women models as spokespersons - they were called &quot;spokesmodels&quot; – would enhance marketing. The brand continues to use this tactic.

<text>[[Hampshire]] is a county in Southern England with some notable archaeology and many notable historic buildings.

The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the neolithic, and these settlers built hill forts such as Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an Ancient British kingdom the Celts called &quot;Gwent&quot; (not be confused with the county in Wales) or &quot;Y Went&quot;, describing the county&#x27;s open downs, which also covered areas that would later belong to Somerset and Wiltshire. In the Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces.

During the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement, modern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were occupied by Jutish tribes – a people separate initially from the Saxons and Angles. Jutes founded kingdoms known as &quot;Wihtwara&quot; (Wight), &quot;Meonwara&quot; (Meon Valley) and &quot;Ytene&quot; (in an area similar to the later site of the New Forest). According to St Bede, however, the Jutes were conquered by the surrounding Saxon kingdoms during the 7th century. &quot;Hamtunscīr&quot; (after &quot;Hamtun&quot;, the original name of Southampton) was one of the first Saxon shires to be recorded, in 755.

For two centuries Hampshire represented the western frontier of Saxon England, as the Britons fought off advances into Dorset and Somerset. After the Saxons advanced west Hampshire became the centre of the Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the 9th century.

After the Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the New Forest as a hunting forest.
The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds. These later consolidated to 37. These were Alton, Andover, Barmanstip, Barton Stacey, Basingstoke, Bedbridge, Bondsborough, Bosmere, Buddlesgate, Christchurch, Chutely, Crondall, East Meon, Evinger, Fawley, Finchdean, Fordingbridge, Hambledon, Heling, Holdsett, King&#x27;s Somborne, Kingsclere, Mansbridge, Meanstoke, Micheldever, New Forest, Odiham, Overton, Pastrow, Portsdown, Ringwood, Shelbourn, Sutton, Thorngate, Titchfield, Waltham and Wherwell.

Over several centuries a series of castles and forts were constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Norman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the latter being crewed largely by Hampshire natives.

Hampshire played a large role in World War II due to its large Royal Navy harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the British Army&#x27;s main permanent camps.

The county has in the past been called &quot;Southamptonshire&quot; and appears as such on some Victorian maps. The name of the administrative county was changed from &#x27;County of Southampton&#x27; to &#x27;County of Hampshire&#x27; on 1 April 1959. The short form of the name, often used in postal addresses, is &quot;Hants&quot;.

The old name appears as the place of embarkation of many of the immigrants into Ellis Island. It is recorded in the Commonwealth Instrument of Government, 1653, which was adopted by Oliver Cromwell when he assumed the office of Lord Protector in 1654.

The Isle of Wight has been for some purposes in the past treated traditionally part of Hampshire, but has been administered separately from Hampshire for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. The island is excluded from the hundreds given above – it was traditionally divided into East Medina and West Medina hundreds. Apart from a shared police force there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire.

The towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch also fall within the historic county of Hampshire.

<text>Matthew Taylor (born October 17, 1981) is an American soccer coach and former player who is currently the head coach of Ventura County FC in MLS Next Pro.

==College career==
Born in Columbus, Ohio, Taylor grew up in Irvine, California and played college soccer at UCLA from 2000 to 2003. Taylor was mostly a substitute his first year, but earned a larger role as a sophomore, finishing the season with seven goals and two assists. As a junior, he bettered that, registering 12 goals and eight assists, while being an important part of a UCLA team that won the NCAA Championship. Taylor&#x27;s senior season was his best, as he scored 14 goals and had 8 assists, was named the Pac-10 Player of the Year, and was a Hermann Trophy finalist. Taylor was the nation&#x27;s leading scorer in the NCAA tournament during UCLA&#x27;s championship run in 2002 and was named to the all tournament team at the college cup. Taylor is also the all-time leading scorer for UCLA in post season tournament play. During his college years he played several games alongside former Germany national team player Jürgen Klinsmann with Orange County Blue Star in the USL Premier Development League.

==Professional career==
An excellent MLS Combine saw the Kansas City Wizards trade up to draft him 4th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Although stuck behind Davy Arnaud and Josh Wolff and receiving little playing time in 2003, Taylor showed his scoring acumen registering three goals and an assist in only 524 minutes from a substitute&#x27;s role.

After his first season, Taylor was left unprotected for the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, and was selected 8th overall by Chivas USA. He became one of the few non-Hispanics on the squad. Taylor was Chivas USA&#x27;s first ever player to be named MLS player of the week. Taylor&#x27;s first four years in MLS were hampered by injuries including a broken tibia, and double hernia surgery. Taylor became a first eleven player for Chivas USA coach Hans Westerhof and responded by leading all offensive categories in a starter&#x27;s role. Taylor just started to regain the speed and quickness to match his work rate when he decided to leave Chivas USA over a contract dispute with then coach Preki. On July 25, 2007, Taylor signed for Portland Timbers.

He had a short stint at the amateur side Hollywood United in the Los Angeles–based USASA-affiliated Coast Soccer League, where he scored two goals on penalty kicks against his former club the Portland Timbers in the first round of the 2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, helping Hollywood to a shocking 3–2 win over the USL side.

On August 14, 2008, Taylor moved to TuS Koblenz, then playing in Germany&#x27;s second tier 2. Fußball-Bundesliga just three days before their season started and scored in his first game for the team. On October 5, 2008, he scored a hat trick for Koblenz in a 5–0 win over Kaiserslautern. On May 27, 2009, Taylor signed a two-year contract with FSV Frankfurt, but left for 3. Liga club Rot Weiss Ahlen after playing only on year for FSV. Taylor moved to Preußen Münster for the 2012/13 3. Liga season after playing the 2011/12 season with SC Paderborn 07 in the 2. Bundesliga. Two years later he signed for 1. FC Saarbrücken.

==Coaching career==
After retiring in 2017, Taylor returned to his alma mater to become an assistant coach at UCLA. In 2021, he became an assistant coach for Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake. On January 22, 2024, he was announced as the new head coach of Ventura County FC.

<text>The Temple of the Six Banyan Trees or Liurong Temple is a Buddhist temple in Guangzhou, China, originally built in AD 537.

The temple&#x27;s proximity to foreign consulates in Guangzhou has made it a regular destination for families participating in the international adoption of children from China. Typically families receive blessings for their newly adopted children at this temple in front of the statue of Guanyin.

==History==
The Baozhuangyan Temple was first constructed by the monk Tanyu under orders from Emperor Wu of the Liang in AD 537. It was constructed to house the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to Panyu (modern Guangzhou).

The temple was burned down and rebuilt during the Northern Song dynasty. Around the same time, Su Shi composed a poem &quot;Six Banyans&quot; (&quot;Liu Rong&quot;) in honor of a visit to the temple. It was since renamed in honor of the famous poem.

The Flower Pagoda, the main structure of the temple, was built in 1097 and was named for its colorful exterior. The structure that had been there before had a square base, but the Flower Pagoda was designed with an octagonal one. It was rebuilt again in 1373 after another fire in the early Ming dynasty period and restored in 1900.

<doc id="1139218" wikidata="Q7742861" url="?curid=1139218" title="The Jackie Gleason Show">
<text>The Jackie Gleason Show is a series of American network television shows that starred Jackie Gleason, which ran from 1952 to 1970, in various forms.

==&quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;==
Gleason&#x27;s first variety series, which aired on the DuMont Television Network under the title Cavalcade of Stars, first aired June 4, 1949. The show&#x27;s first host was comedian Jack Carter, who was followed by Jerry Lester. Lester jumped to NBC in June 1950 to host the late-night show &quot;Broadway Open House&quot;, a precursor to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and Gleason—who had made his mark filling in for William Bendix as the title character on the first television incarnation of &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; sitcom—stepped into &quot;Cavalcade&quot; on July 15, 1950 and became an immediate sensation.

The show was broadcast live in front of a theater audience, and offered the same kind of vaudevillian entertainment common to early television revues. Gleason&#x27;s guests included New York-based performers of stage and screen, including Bert Wheeler, Smith and Dale, Patricia Morison, and Vivian Blaine. Production values were modest, owing to DuMont&#x27;s humble facilities and a thrifty sponsor (Quality Drugs, representing most of the nation&#x27;s drug stores).

In 1952, CBS president William S. Paley offered Gleason a considerably higher salary to move to that network. The series was retitled &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and premiered on CBS Television on September 20, 1952. In 1953, CBS&#x27; own orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. made a cameo appearance.

While much of DuMont&#x27;s programming archive was destroyed after they ceased broadcasting, a surprising number of &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; episodes survive, including several episodes at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Additionally, at least 14 Gleason episodes survive at the Paley Center for Media.

In his book &quot;The Forgotten Network&quot;, author David Weinstein mentions an unusual aspect of the DuMont network. He notes that while Drug Store Productions was technically the sponsor, they in turn sold the commercial air time to various companies and products. Weinstein notes this as an early example of U.S. network television moving away from the single-sponsor system typical of the early 1950s. He quotes former DuMont executive Ted Bergmann describing the DuMont version as featuring six commercial breaks during the hour, with each break comprising a single one-minute commercial.

==Format==

The show typically opened with a monologue from Gleason, followed by sketch comedy involving Gleason and a number of regular performers (including Art Carney) and a musical interlude featuring the June Taylor Dancers. (Taylor later became Gleason&#x27;s sister-in-law; he married her sister Marilyn in 1975.)

Gleason portrayed a number of recurring characters, including:
*supercilious, mustachioed playboy millionaire Reginald Van Gleason III (Gleason&#x27;s personal favorite)
*friendly Joe the Bartender
*loudmouthed braggart Charlie Bratton
*Rum Dum, a hapless dipsomaniac with a walrus mustache
*mild-mannered Fenwick Babbitt
*The Bachelor who was forever unmarried
*bombastic Rudy the Repairman
*a put-upon character known only as the Poor Soul, whom Gleason performed in pantomime. 
*Stanley R. Sogg, late-night movie pitchman for Mother Fletcher&#x27;s products (&quot;No-Cal Chicken Fat&quot;)
*blowhard Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden

The series was a big hit for CBS, finishing at #8 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1953–1954 season and #2 in 1954–1955. &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; also earned Emmy nominations for best variety series in 1953, 1954 and 1955, for Gleason as best star in 1954 and 1955, for Audrey Meadows as best supporting actress in 1954 and 1957, Art Carney for best supporting actor in 1957, June Taylor for best choreography in 1956, and best writing and best engineering effects in 1955. The series won Emmys for Meadows as best supporting actress in 1955, Carney as best supporting actor in 1954 and 1955, and Taylor for choreography in 1955. Gleason never received an Emmy.

==&quot;The Honeymooners&quot;==
By far the most memorable and popular of Gleason&#x27;s characters was blowhard Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden, featured originally in a series of &quot;Cavalcade&quot; skits known as &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, with Pert Kelton as his wife Alice, and Art Carney as his upstairs neighbor Ed Norton. These were so popular that in 1955 Gleason suspended the variety format and filmed &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as a regular half-hour sitcom (television&#x27;s first spin-off), co-starring Carney, Audrey Meadows (who had replaced the blacklisted Kelton after the earlier move to CBS), and Joyce Randolph. Finishing 19th in the ratings, these 39 episodes were subsequently rerun constantly in syndication, often five nights a week, with the cycle repeating every two months for decades. They are probably the most familiar body of work from 1950s television with the exception of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.

The show&#x27;s original variety format and title returned in September 1956 and continued until June 1957. Then, in October 1958, Gleason debuted a half-hour version of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, with Buddy Hackett as a sidekick, but it was short-lived, cancelled in January 1959.

==&quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (1961 revision)==
In 1961, Gleason began an ill-fated stint as host of a game show called &quot;You&#x27;re in the Picture&quot;, which lasted only one episode, and was so poorly received that it led to Gleason offering an on-air apology to his viewers the following week. Committed to filling a quota of episodes, Gleason renamed the series &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and turned it into a short-lived talk show, featuring one-on-one informal interviews with Art Carney, Jayne Mansfield, Bobby Darin, and other friends and celebrities. It ran for eight episodes.

==&quot;American Scene Magazine&quot;, 1962–1965==

In 1962, Gleason returned to the tried-and-true variety format with his &quot;American Scene Magazine&quot;. The official title of the show was, again, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. &quot;American Scene&quot; was initially taped in New York City; after two seasons, production moved to Miami Beach (1964), on Jackie&#x27;s insistence. (This caused difficulties for announcer Johnny Olson, who had several other announcing jobs; Olson commuted frequently between New York City and Miami to accommodate Gleason.)

Gleason would begin his monologue each week and be surprised by the flamboyant jackets worn by bandleader Sammy Spear. (Beholding Spear&#x27;s animal-print blazer, Gleason quipped, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard of Tiger Rag, but this is ridiculous!&quot;) Ralph Kramden, Reggie Van Gleason, the Poor Soul, and the rest of Gleason&#x27;s comic characters were regular attractions. Frank Fontaine, as bug-eyed, grinning &quot;Crazy&quot; Guggenheim (evolved from his John character from &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;), starred in the Joe the Bartender skits, delighting fans with his nutty speaking voice and goofy laugh, and charmed by his surprisingly mellow singing voice. June Taylor&#x27;s chorus girl routines revived for the television generation the aerial pattern kaleidoscope formations made famous on film by Busby Berkeley. During this time, Gleason&#x27;s show finished #17 for the 1962–1963 season, #15 for 1963–1964, #21 in 1964–1965 and #24 in 1965–1966.

==&quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; – 1966-1970==
In fall 1966, the show title reverted to simply &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (dropping the &quot;American Scene&quot; format), and would remain so until its cancellation in 1970. By this point episodes included guest stars and skits. A component during this period was the musical &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes, which had first been tried on Gleason&#x27;s variety show during the 1956–1957 season. These were later collected as &quot;The Color Honeymooners&quot;, with Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean as Alice and Trixie, respectively. The regular cast included Art Carney; Milton Berle was a frequent guest star. The show was shot in color on videotape at the Miami Beach Auditorium (today called the Fillmore at the Jackie Gleason Theatre), and Gleason never tired of promoting the &quot;sun and fun capital of the world&quot; on camera. Hordes of vacationers took Gleason&#x27;s advice, boosting Florida&#x27;s economy. Later specials were taped at the Olympia Theatre&#x27;s Gusman Center across Biscayne Bay in downtown Miami. The shows began with the television camera in front of a boat speeding toward the shore of Miami Beach, and ended with Gleason bellowing, &quot;Miami Beach audiences are the greatest audiences in the world!&quot;

During this period, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; earned three more Emmy nominations, for Carney for special classification in 1966 and for variety series and writing in 1967. Carney won two Emmys for his work in 1967 and 1968. The series also ranked at No. 5 in 1966-1967 and No. 9 in 1967-1968.

At the end of the 1968–1969 season, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; still garnered decent ratings, ranking at No. 25 in the Nielsens and CBS renewed it for an eighth season. The following year would bring a radical change to the series: Gleason went on a stringent diet in 1969 and lost approximately 60 pounds. When the show returned in September 1969, there was much publicity about Gleason&#x27;s new slimmer look. To gracefully incorporate his weight loss into the show, it was explained that Ralph Kramden also had gone on a diet and lost weight.

This change proved to be somewhat of a detriment – especially since Carney had gained weight. Jokes about Kramden&#x27;s weight had been a strong component of humor for the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches. A skinnier Ralph did not seem as funny to viewers and the overall ratings for the program began to slip. Coupled with the fact that the CBS network was concerned with demographics and wanted to change its image with more urban-oriented shows (to attract younger, more affluent audiences). In addition, CBS wanted Gleason to do only the hour-long Honeymooners and drop the variety episodes that garnered lower ratings. Gleason objected to this and, on February 16, 1970, CBS announced the cancellation of Gleason&#x27;s series, during a time frame that also saw the cancellation of &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, in the opening salvos of what would become popularly known as the rural purge.

Beginning in late December 1970 CBS began airing selected reruns of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (featuring only the color &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes) in prime time on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. which replaced &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy Hour&quot;.

<doc id="1139221" wikidata="Q3775755" url="?curid=1139221" title="Masking tape">
<text>Masking tape, also known as painter&#x27;s tape, is a type of pressure-sensitive tape made of a thin and easy-to-tear paper, and an easily released pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is available in a variety of widths. It is used mainly in painting, to mask off areas that should not be painted. 

Some inexpensive masking tapes are suited for general use in homes and offices. Others are designed for professional house painters. Masking tapes for automotive or aircraft use have special characteristics for these demanding applications. 
==History==
Masking tape was created in 1925 by 3M employee Richard Gurley Drew. Drew observed autobody workers growing frustrated when they removed butcher paper they had taped to cars they were painting. The strong adhesive on the tape peeled off some of the paint they had just applied. Touching up the damaged areas increased their costs. Drew realized the need for tape with a gentler adhesive.

==Constructions==
Several constructions of masking tapes have been developed. Many are designed for a specific purpose. 

The backing of masking tape is typically paper, although plastic films and metal foils have also been used. Most papers are creped (rather than flat) to allow the tape to stretch when applied to a curved line. Tapes can be natural paper (beige) or different colors. Paper backings are often saturated with resins to help prevent paint from seeping through the paper. Many tapes have a release coating on the top of the tape to help the tape release from the roll. 

The pressure sensitive adhesive on masking tapes need to create an effective bond to the intended surface, particularly on the edges to prevent paint from working in and causing a rough paint line. Once the paint is dry, the adhesive must also release cleanly from the surface without damaging the surface or leaving residue. 

Most masking tapes are designed for temporary use at ambient temperatures. When needed, special tapes are available for longer term usage, higher temperatures, chemical washes, sunlight, etc.

==Usage==
For its original use of marking off areas where paint is not desired, a special grade of painter&#x27;s masking tape is needed. With this special grade, very clean lines can be produced. Without it, the paint bleeds under the edges of the tape, producing a fuzzy or varied line.

Drafting tape looks similar to ordinary household masking tape, but has a lower tack. It is intended to hold blueprints to a drawing board or light table, and to pull off easily without damaging the drawing.

Masking tape is also used in long strips on larger glass panes in situations where the glass might be shattered, harming those in the vicinity.

==Other types==
When constructed with plastic films instead of paper, masking tapes can be used for more rigorous applications. Polyester-based tapes are used to mask off during etching, plating, and in particular, powder coating. Tapes based on polyimide films can resist molten solder in electronics applications. Glass cloth tapes are often used in powder coating and sandblasting operations. Foil or vinyl tapes are often used in plating. Layered tapes made from multiple materials laminated together can be used for masking flame spray, thermal spray and HVOF. Masking tape can also be used to adhere posters to walls up to the day rating. Masking tape can basically be used for any purpose required of it, and is not limited solely to painting needs.

The adhesive applied to a tape is often a critical determining factor for a given masking situation. There are three thin types of adhesives (with many chemical variations of each): rubber-based, acrylic-based, and silicone-based. Rubber-based adhesives generally provide the greatest adhesion, but the lowest temperature resistance. Acrylic-based adhesives offer a wide temperature range, providing adhesion from sub-freezing temperatures up to 275–325 °F (about 150 °C). Silicone-based adhesives provide the highest temperature resistance, with some tapes (such as some polyimide films and glass cloth tapes) allowing for intermittent use up to 500 °F (260 °C).

<doc id="1139235" wikidata="Q1200855" url="?curid=1139235" title="James Tod">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod (20 March 1782 – 18 November 1835) was an officer of the British East India Company and an Oriental scholar. He combined his official role and his amateur interests to create a series of works about the history and geography of India, and in particular the area then known as Rajputana that corresponds to the present day state of Rajasthan, and which Tod referred to as &quot;Rajast&#x27;han&quot;.

Tod was born in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a military officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod was involved in the intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region under the control of the East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.

Back home in England, Tod published a number of academic works about Indian history and geography, most notably &quot;Annals and Antiquities of Rajast&#x27;han&quot;, based on materials collected during his travels. He retired from the military in 1826, and married Julia Clutterbuck that same year. He died in 1835, aged 53.

==Life and career==

Tod was born in Islington, London, on 20 March 1782. He was the second son for his parents, James and Mary (née Heatly), both of whom came from families of &quot;high standing&quot;, according to his major biographer, the historian Jason Freitag. He was educated in Scotland, whence his ancestors came, although precisely where he was schooled is unknown. Those ancestors included people who had fought with the King of Scots, Robert the Bruce; he took pride in this fact and had an acute sense of what he perceived to be the chivalric values of those times.

As with many people of Scots descent who sought adventure and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He left England for India in 1799 and in doing so followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior had not been in the company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting as a member of the escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.

Rather than being situated permanently in one place, the royal court was moved around the kingdom. Tod undertook various topographical and geological studies as it travelled from one area to another, using his training as an engineer and employing other people to do much of the field work. These studies culminated in 1815 with the production of a map which he presented to the Governor-General, the Marquis of Hastings. This map of &quot;Central India&quot; (his phrase) became of strategic importance to the British as they were soon to fight the Third Anglo-Maratha War. During that war, which ran from 1817 to 1818, Tod acted as a superintendent of the intelligence department and was able to draw on other aspects of regional knowledge which he had acquired while moving around with the court. He also drew up various strategies for the military campaign.

In 1818 he was appointed Political Agent for various states of western Rajputana, in the northwest of India, where the British East India Company had come to amicable arrangements with the Rajput rulers in order to exert indirect control over the area. The anonymous author of the introduction to Tod&#x27;s posthumously published book, &quot;Travels in Western India&quot;, says that 

Tod continued his surveying work in this physically challenging, arid and mountainous area. His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of Mewar, Kota, Sirohi and Bundi, he soon added Marwar to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for Jaisalmer. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the Khyber Pass. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting the likelihood of the inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. Charanas were called upon to create a master list of the &#x27;Thirty Six Royal Races of Rajasthan&#x27; with Tod&#x27;s guru Yati Gyanchandra presiding the panel. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod&#x27;s &quot;transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and &#x27;routinised&#x27; political hierarchies.&quot; His successes were plentiful and the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that Tod was 

Tod was not, however, universally respected in the East India Company. His immediate superior, David Ochterlony, was unsettled by Tod&#x27;s rapid rise and frequent failure to consult with him. One Rajput prince objected to Tod&#x27;s close involvement in the affairs of his state and succeeded in persuading the authorities to remove Marwar from Tod&#x27;s area of influence. In 1821 his favouritism towards one party in a princely dispute, contrary to the orders given to him, gave rise to a severe reprimand and a formal restriction of his ability to operate without consulting Ochterlony, as well as the removal of Kota from his charge. Jaisalmer was then taken out of his sphere of influence in 1822, as official concerns grew regarding his sympathy for the Rajput princes. This and other losses of status, such as the reduction in the size of his escort, caused him to believe that his personal reputation and ability to work successfully in Mewar, by now the one area still left to him, was too diminished to be acceptable. He resigned his role as Political Agent in Mewar later that year, citing ill health. Reginald Heber, the Bishop of Calcutta, commented that 

In February 1823, Tod left India for England, having first travelled to Bombay by a circuitous route for his own pleasure.

During the last years of his life Tod talked about India at functions in Paris and elsewhere across Europe. He also became a member of the newly established Royal Asiatic Society in London, for whom he acted for some time as librarian. He suffered an apoplectic fit in 1825 as a consequence of overwork, and retired from his military career in the following year, soon after he had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel. His marriage to Julia Clutterbuck (daughter of Henry Clutterbuck) in 1826 produced three children – Grant Heatly Tod-Heatly, Edward H. M. Tod and Mary Augusta Tod – but his health, which had been poor for much of his life, was declining. Having lived at Birdhurst, Croydon, from October 1828, Tod and his family moved to London three years later. He spent much of the last year of his life abroad in an attempt to cure a chest complaint and died on 18 November 1835 soon after his return to England from Italy. The cause of death was an apoplectic fit sustained on the day of his wedding anniversary, although he survived for a further 27 hours. He had moved into a house in Regent&#x27;s Park earlier in that year.

==Worldview==
Historian Lynn Zastoupil has noted that Tod&#x27;s personal papers have never been found and &quot;his voluminous publications and official writings contain only scattered clues regarding the nature of his personal relationships with Rajputs&quot;. This has not discouraged assessments being made of both him and his worldview. According to Theodore Koditschek, whose fields of study include historiography and British imperial history, Tod saw the Rajputs as &quot;natural allies of the British in their struggles against the Mughal and Maratha states&quot;. Norbert Peabody, an anthropologist and historian, has gone further, arguing that &quot;maintaining the active support of groups, like the Rajputs for example, was not only important in meeting the threat of indigenous rivals but also in countering the imperial aspirations of other European powers.&quot; He stated that some of Tod&#x27;s thoughts were &quot;implicated in [British] colonial policy toward western India for over a century.&quot;

Tod favoured the then-fashionable concept of Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, he thought that each princely state should be inhabited by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful in both of these endeavours.

Tod was unsuccessful in implementing another of his ideas, which was also based on the ideology of Romantic nationalism. He believed that the replacement of Maratha rule with that of the British had resulted in the Rajputs merely swapping the onerous overlordship of one government for that of another. Although he was one of the architects of indirect rule, in which the princes looked after domestic affairs but paid tribute to the British for protection in foreign affairs, he was also a critic of it. He saw the system as one that prevented achievement of true nationhood, and therefore, as Peabody describes, &quot;utterly subversive to the stated goal of preserving them as viable entities.&quot; Tod wrote in 1829 that the system of indirect rule had a tendency to &quot;national degradation&quot; of the Rajput territories and that this undermined them because

There was a political aspect to his views: if the British recast themselves as overseers seeking to re-establish lost Rajput nations, then this would at once smooth the relationship between those two parties and distinguish the threatening, denationalising Marathas from the paternal, nation-creating British. It was an argument that had been deployed by others in the European arena, including in relation to the way in which Britain portrayed the imperialism of Napoleonic France as denationalising those countries which it conquered, whereas (it was claimed) British imperialism freed people; William Bentinck, a soldier and statesmen who later in life served as Governor-General of India, noted in 1811 that &quot;Bonaparte made kings; England makes nations&quot;. However, his arguments in favour of granting sovereignty to the Rajputs failed to achieve that end, although the frontispiece to volume one of his &quot;Annals&quot; did contain a plea to the then English King George IV to reinstate the &quot;former independence&quot; of the Rajputs.

While he viewed the Muslim Mughals as despotic and the Marathas as predatory, Tod saw the Rajput social systems as being similar to the feudal system of medieval Europe, and their traditions of recounting history through the generations as similar to the clan poets of the Scottish Highlanders. There was, he felt, a system of checks and balances between the ruling princes and their vassal lords, a tendency for feuds and other rivalries, and often a serf-like peasantry. The Rajputs were, in his opinion, on the same developmental trajectory that nations such as Britain had followed. His ingenious use of these viewpoints later enabled him to promote in his books the notion that there was a shared experience between the people of Britain and this community in a distant, relatively unexplored area of the empire. He speculated that there was a common ancestor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans somewhere deep in prehistory and that this might be proven by comparison of the commonality in their history of ideas, such as myth and legend. In this he shared a contemporary aspiration to prove that all communities across the world had a common origin. There was another appeal inherent in a feudal system, and it was not unique to Tod: the historian Thomas R. Metcalf has said that Above all, the chivalric ideal viewed character as more worthy of admiration than wealth or intellect, and this appealed to the old landed classes at home as well as to many who worked for the Indian Civil Service.

In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an administrator of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod&#x27;s classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role in the relationship between princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.

Tod&#x27;s enthusiasm for bardic poetry reflected the works of Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod&#x27;s Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history on the basis of the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone – for example, the polymath James Mill – accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as &quot;Puranas&quot;.

==Publications==

Koditschek says that Tod &quot;developed an interest in triangulating local culture, politics and history alongside his maps&quot;, and Metcalf believes that Tod &quot;ordered [the Rajputs&#x27;] past as well as their present&quot; while working in India. During his time in Rajputana, Tod was able to collect materials for his &quot;Annals and Antiquities of Rajast&#x27;han&quot;, which detailed the contemporary geography and history of Rajputana and Central India along with the history of the Rajput clans who ruled most of the area at that time. Described by historian Crispin Bates as &quot;a romantic historical and anecdotal account&quot; and by David Arnold, another historian, as a &quot;travel narrative&quot; by &quot;one of India&#x27;s most influential Romantic writers&quot;, the work was published in two volumes, in 1829 and 1832, and included illustrations and engravings by notable artists such as the Storers, Louis Haghe and either Edward or William Finden. He had to finance publication himself: sales of works on history had been moribund for some time and his name was not particularly familiar either at home or abroad. Original copies are now scarce, but they have been reprinted in many editions. The version published in 1920, which was edited by the orientalist and folklorist William Crooke, is significantly editorialised.

Freitag has argued that the &quot;Annals&quot; &quot;is first and foremost a story of the heroes of Rajasthan ... plotted in a certain way – there are villains, glorious acts of bravery, and a chivalric code to uphold&quot;. So dominant did Tod&#x27;s work become in the popular and academic mind that they largely replaced the older accounts like &quot;Nainsi ri Khyat&quot; and even &quot;Prithvirãj Rãso.&quot; Tod had even used the &quot;Raso&quot; for his content. Kumar Singh, of the Anthropological Survey of India, has explained that the &quot;Annals&quot; were primarily based on &quot;bardic accounts and personal encounters&quot; and that they &quot;glorified and romanticised the Rajput rulers and their country&quot; but ignored other communities.

One aspect of history that Tod studied in his &quot;Annals&quot; was the genealogy of the &quot;Chathis Rajkula&quot; (36 royal races), for the purpose of which he took advice on linguistic issues from a panel of &quot;pandits&quot;, including a Jain guru called Yati Gyanchandra. He said that he was &quot;desirous of epitomising the chronicles of the martial races of Central and Western India&quot; and that this necessitated study of their genealogy. The sources for this were &quot;Puranas&quot; held by the Rana of Udaipur.

Tod also submitted archæological papers to the Royal Asiatic Society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot; series. He was interested in numismatics as well, and he discovered the first specimens of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins from the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, which were described in his books. These ancient kingdoms had been largely forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod&#x27;s findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins have been found in large quantities since his death.

In addition to these writings, he produced a paper on the politics of Western India that was appended to the report of the House of Commons committee on Indian affairs, 1833. He had also taken notes on his journey to Bombay and collated them for another book, &quot;Travels in Western India&quot;. That book was published posthumously in 1839.

==Reception==

Criticism of the &quot;Annals&quot; came soon after publication. The anonymous author of the introduction to his posthumously published &quot;Travels&quot; states that 

Further criticism followed. Tod was an officer of the British imperial system, at that time the world&#x27;s dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard what they told him but knew little of what they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by the very people whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the &quot;Annals&quot; were &quot;manifestly biased&quot;. Freitag argues that critics of Tod&#x27;s literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation.

Tod relied heavily on existing Indian texts for his historical information and most of these are today considered unreliable. Crooke&#x27;s introduction to Tod&#x27;s 1920 edition of the &quot;Annals&quot; recorded that the old Indian texts recorded &quot;the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer and his contemporaries supposed that they occurred.&quot; Crooke also says that Tod&#x27;s &quot;knowledge of ethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local chronicles of the Rajputs.&quot; More recently, Robin Donkin, a historian and geographer, has argued that, with one exception, &quot;there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century&quot;, and that researchers must rely on the accounts of travellers from outside the country.

Tod&#x27;s work relating to the genealogy of the &quot;Chathis Rajkula&quot; was criticised as early as 1872, when an anonymous reviewer in the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot; said that Other examples of dubious interpretations made by Tod include his assertions regarding the ancestry of the Mohil Rajput clan when, even today, there is insufficient evidence to prove his point. He also mistook Rana Kumbha, a ruler of Mewar in the fifteenth century, as being the husband of the princess-saint Mira Bai and misrepresented the story of the queen Padmini. The founder of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, writing in 1885, noted that Tod had made &quot;a whole bundle of mistakes&quot; in relation to the dating of the Battle of Khanwa, and Crooke notes in his introduction to the 1920 edition that Tod&#x27;s &quot;excursions into philology are the diversions of a clever man, not of a trained scholar, but interested in the subject as an amateur.&quot; Michael Meister, an architectural historian and professor of South Asia Studies, has commented that Tod had a &quot;general reputation for inaccuracy ... among Indologists by late in the nineteenth century&quot;, although the opinion of those Indologists sometimes prevented them from appreciating some of the useful aspects in his work. That reputation persists, with one modern writer, V. S. Srivastava of Rajasthan&#x27;s Department of Archaeology and Museums, commenting that his works &quot;are erroneous and misleading at places and they are to be used with caution as a part of sober history&quot;.

In its time, Tod&#x27;s work was influential even among officials of the government, although it was never formally recognised as authoritative. Andrea Major, who is a cultural and colonial historian, has commented on a specific example, that of the tradition of sati (ritual immolation of a widow): 

The romantic nationalism that Tod espoused was used by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British control of the country. Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore&#x27;s &quot;Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama&quot; and Girishchandra Ghosh&#x27;s &quot;Ananda Raho&quot; retold Tod&#x27;s vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew their story from Tod&#x27;s works include &quot;Padmini Upakhyan&quot; (1858) by Rangalal Banerjee and &quot;Krishna Kumari&quot; (1861) by Michael Madhusudan Dutt.

In modern-day India, he is still revered by those whose ancestors he documented in good light. In 1997, the Maharana Mewar Charitable Foundation instituted an award named after Tod and intended it to be given to modern non-Indian writers who exemplified Tod&#x27;s understanding of the area and its people. In other recognition of his work in Mewar Province, a village has been named &quot;Todgarh&quot;, and it has been claimed that Tod was in fact a Rajput as an outcome of the process of karma and rebirth. Freitag describes the opinion of the Rajput people 

Furthermore, Freitag points out that &quot;the information age has also anointed Tod as the spokesman for Rajasthan, and the glories of India in general, as attested by the prominent quotations from him that appear in tourism related websites.&quot;

<text>Hanna Gunilla Marklund (born 26 November 1977, in Skellefteå) is a Swedish former football player. She played as a defender and wore shirt number 4.

==Career==
Marklund started playing in Varuträsk IF near Skellefteå, where she grew up. She moved on to play in Damallsvenskan with Sunnanå SK. In 2000, she joined Umeå IK, with whom she won Damallsvenskan three years in a row (2000–2002). After the 2004 season she decided to move back to Skellefteå and rejoin Sunnanå SK, where her two sisters Carolina and Mirjam also played. She went on to captain Sunnanå SK.

She made her first appearance in the Swedish national team on 8 August 1997, against Iceland. She became a regular member of the team, winning a total of 118 caps and scoring six international goals.

In November 2005 she won Diamantbollen, an award given the best female player in Sweden each year.

On 7 January 2008, Marklund announced her retirement from both the national team and Sunnanå SK as a result of her pregnancy.

Hanna Marklund appeared for Sweden in two World Cups (USA 2003, China 2007) and two Olympic Games (Sydney 2000, Athens 2004.) Marklund was on the roster for the 1999 World Cup as well, but did not see any playing time.

Hanna Marklund participated in two European Championship tournaments: Germany 2001, and England 2005.

<doc id="1139240" wikidata="Q5535363" url="?curid=1139240" title="Geology of Hampshire">
<text>The visible geology of [[Hampshire]] in southern England broadly comprises a folded succession of sedimentary rocks dating from the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods – mostly gentle folding in the north, more complex folding along the south coast. The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations that comprise the Chalk Group and give rise to the county&#x27;s downlands. Overlying these rocks are the less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups which characterise the Hampshire Basin.

Hampshire’s geological ‘basement’ was probably formed in the early Devonian or late Silurian periods, then folded during the later Devonian and early Permian periods. Two faults have driven much of its later geological development. The county’s near-surface geology was built up in three stages: first, when layers of clay, limestone and mudstone were laid down in and around Jurassic seas; then, when sands and clays washed off the London Platform early in the Cretaceous period; and finally, as the sea rose again and covered southern England to a considerable depth, great thicknesses of chalk were laid down. This was later shaped in two further stages; first the Alpine orogeny, which inverted the London Platform to become a London Basin, then the Anglian glaciation. The Anglian and later glaciations moved the course of the Thames (southwards) and the Solent (eastwards), and during this time the rivers that run between them were opened by melting glacial outwash, bringing sands, clays, gravels and some iron down these rivers.

Oil has been extracted from Triassic strata, and natural gas from the Great Oolite, at Humbly Grove and oil continues to be drawn from the Great Oolite at more than eighteen smaller wells near Horndean, Stockbridge and Andover.

==Fault System==
The two major structures are the Purbeck–Wight and the Wardour–Portsdown fault zones. Both faults originated in Variscan northward thrusting that began in the Devonian and continued into the early Permian period, generating faults across a band from east to west that mainly propagated in a north-west to south-east direction. During the late Permian and Triassic periods, what had mostly been compressional tectonic movement (plates moving together) became extensional (plates moving apart), causing reverse faults to become normal faulting and starting the basins in Hampshire. These continued to subside between the Jurassic and the early Cretaceous, by which time the tectonic movement had largely ceased.

In Hampshire, the western end of a ridge running up from Dieppe separated the Weald basin from the Wessex and Hampshire basins. This ‘Hampshire–Dieppe high’ ran approximately between the two main faults.

During the late Cretaceous the north–south compression that was pushing up the Alps reversed the direction of these faults. In a series of relatively short but brisk pulses (lasting less than a million years each), softer areas of Cretaceous sands and chalk along the Wardour–Portsdown fault were inverted and pushed upwards into a series of synclines and anticlines (see ‘Chalk Downs’ below), while the hard Jurassic limestone along the south coast may have resisted the pressure, leading to a more complex pattern of folds, and both normal and reverse faults, along the Purbeck–Wight fault and further west. This may have continued as late as the Miocene. The eroded remains of the Hampshire–Dieppe high collapsed into a basin between the new anticlines along the Wardour–Portsdown fault and the Portland–Wight high (itself an inverted former basin).

The Bray fault in the English Channel may link with one or the other of these faults: the issue is controversial.

==Hampshire Basin==

South of a ridge that runs from the coast, soft Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels form low, fairly flat terrain, the Hampshire Basin. Protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight, this land supports heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which form part of the New Forest. The Basin extends for a considerable distance west across Dorset and southern Wiltshire.

Much of the coastal landscape of the Hampshire Basin results from sea level rise in the Flandrian (after the last ice age) some 6000 years BP. There are several large estuaries and rias, notably the 12-mile-long Southampton Water and the large, convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Solent, which separates the Isle of Wight from the coast of Hampshire, is the valley of what used to be a much larger river, erosion having broken the remaining chalk link with the mainland.

==Chalk Downs==
In the centre and north of the county the substrate is the chalk of the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects, as well as arable agriculture. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Kennet valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches the height of 286m/938 ft. The rivers Test and Itchen flow from the downland through green valleys, both supporting trout and other wildlife.

A series of east–west trending folds in the chalk to the north of the Hampshire Basin is controlled by the faults in the underlying strata. From south to north these are the Winchester-East Meon Anticline, the Winchester-King&#x27;s Somborne Syncline/Alderbury–Mottisfont Syncline, the Stockbridge Anticline and the Micheldever Syncline. The Winchester–East Meon Anticline in particular gives rise to many hills including Yew Hill, Compton Down, Oliver&#x27;s Battery, Magdalen (Morn) Hill, Chilcomb Down, Cheesefoot Head, Telegraph Hill, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down, St Catherine&#x27;s Hill, Beacon Hill, Old Winchester Hill and Henwood Down.

Around the chalk margins to the north are the Pewsey–Kingsclere Anticline and to the south the Dean Hill Anticline, Portsdown Anticline, Forest of Bere Syncline and Chichester Syncline.

Further north, beyond the downs, the landscape is again lowland clay and gravel heathland, though the north (where the chalk is at or close to the surface) is generally greener and more diverse than the south.

<doc id="1139242" wikidata="Q7550949" url="?curid=1139242" title="Social balance theory">
<text>Social balance theory is a class of theories about balance or imbalance of sentiment relation in dyadic or triadic relations with social network theory. Sentiments can result in the emergence of two groups. Disliking exists between the two subgroups within liking agents.

==Development of the theory==
This theory evolved over time to produce models more closely resembling real-world social networks. It uses a balance index to measure the effect of local balance on that of a global level and also on a more intimate level, like in interpersonal relationships. Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary introduced &quot;clustering&quot; to account for multiple social cliques. Davis introduced &quot;hierarchical clustering&quot; to account for asymmetric relations.

The topology and hubness of positive and negative links have been shown to significantly affect the structural balance of real-world signed networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-021-81767-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This property is explainable in terms of the high degree of skewness of the sign distributions on the nodes of the graph.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.1109521108&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of relationships have been modeled to explore the finite states of social networks, ranging from an idealized &quot;paradise,&quot; where all links represent friendships, to social bipolarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1103/PhysRevE.72.036121&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1103/PhysRevE.104.034303&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The energy landscape of social relationships has been conceptualized using interacting spin models, based on the contrast between balanced and imbalanced relationships in social networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.198701&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This framework has also been applied to the study of brain network dynamics, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive and brain systems and contributing to the development of improved neurobiomarkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-024-83696-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features of the theory ==

=== 3 Relationship Types ===
Structural balance theory, proposed by the psychologist Fritz Heider in the 1940s, is a framework used to understand the dynamics of relationships within social networks. The theory focuses on the notion that individuals strive for consistency and harmony in their interpersonal relationships.

According to structural balance theory, relationships between individuals can be categorized into three types:

# Positive (or balanced) relationships: These are relationships where all parties involved have mutual positive sentiments toward each other. For example, if A likes B and B likes C, then A should also like C to maintain balance.
# Negative (or imbalanced) relationships: These are relationships where there is conflict or antagonism between individuals. For example, if A dislikes B and B dislikes C, then A should like C to restore balance.
# Mixed relationships: These are relationships that are neither entirely positive nor entirely negative. They can create tension or discomfort within the social network until balance is achieved.

Structural balance theory suggests that individuals tend to seek and maintain balanced relationships within their social networks. When imbalances occur, individuals may adjust their relationships or perceptions to restore balance. This theory has been applied in various fields such as sociology, psychology, and computer science to study phenomena like group dynamics, social influence, and network stability.

=== 4 Rules ===
Structural balance theory posits that some types of triads are forbidden and others are permitted on the basis of four rules.

Using the term “friend” to designate a positive sentiment and the term “enemy” to designate a negative sentiment, the classic balance model defines a sentiment network as balanced if it contains no violations of four assumptions:

(A1)  A friend of a friend is a friend,

(A2)  A friend of an enemy is an enemy,

(A3)  An enemy of a friend is an enemy,

(A4)  An enemy of an enemy is a friend.

=== 16 Triad Types ===
The configuration of sentiments in each triad can be classified as one of 16 possible types.

The 16 types of triads that are possible in any group of three or more individuals are characterized by three numbers indicating the number of mutual (M), asymmetric (A), and null (N) ties, and symbols that discriminate triads with identical MAN numbers. These symbols include transitive (T), up (U), down (D), and cyclic (C) when required. Only two triads (300 and 102) do not violate any of the four rules, leading to the classic model&#x27;s implication of united or bifurcated macrostructures (page 6).

<doc id="1139253" wikidata="Q6900387" url="?curid=1139253" title="Monique Smith (Canadian politician)">
<text>Monique M. Smith (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011 who represented the riding of Nipissing. She was a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Smith was born and raised in North Bay, Ontario, the largest city in the Nipissing riding. She has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, and a law degree from Queen&#x27;s University. After graduating, she worked at the Toronto law firm of McCarthy Tétrault until 1997, when she resigned to work as chief of staff for provincial Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty. She served as director of operations for the Liberals in the 1999 provincial election, which the party lost.

After this election, Smith became executive director of the Association of Canadian Publishers, and represented the organization across the country. She returned to North Bay in 2002, and worked for the firm of Larmer and Larmer.

Her father, Dick Smith, represented Nipissing in the legislature from 1965 to 1977. Her mother Marthe Smith was the Liberal candidate for the riding in 1987.

==Politics==
Smith ran for political office in the 2003 provincial election, in the Nipissing riding (until recently held by former Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris). Despite her roots in the North Bay community, she was often described as a &quot;Toronto lawyer&quot; and a &quot;parachute candidate&quot; by the Tory campaign. These criticisms were not an obstacle to her being elected, and she defeated Harris&#x27; immediate successor, Al McDonald, by just over 3,000 votes.

The Liberals won the election, and Smith was subsequently named parliamentary assistant to George Smitherman, the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. In December 2003, Smitherman commissioned her to undertake a comprehensive review of the province&#x27;s long-term care system. The review was published in May 2004 calling for more funding and inspections.

On October 30, 2007 following the provincial election, Premier Dalton McGuinty appointed Smith into cabinet as the province&#x27;s Minister of Revenue. In a cabinet shuffle on September 18, 2008, Smith was appointed as the province&#x27;s Minister of Tourism. On February 4, 2009 Smith was appointed Government House Leader. She continued as Minister of Tourism until she was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in January 2010.

On November 19, 2010, Smith announced that she would not run in the 2011 election.

In August 2013, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed Smith to represent the Government of Ontario at its office at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC.

On July 16, 2018, Conservative Premier Doug Ford withdrew Monique Smith from her position as the representative in a Washington, DC effective immediately. https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4748423

==After politics==
On August 15, 2013, she was appointed by Premier Kathleen Wynne to run Ontario&#x27;s office in the Canadian embassy in Washington.

<text>Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport () , also known by its previous name Brnik Airport (), is the international airport serving Ljubljana and the largest airport in Slovenia. It is located near Brnik, northwest of Ljubljana and east of Kranj, at the foothills of Kamnik–Savinja Alps.

==History==
The airport was officially opened in December 1963. It replaced Polje Airport in the former Municipality of Polje near Ljubljana, which served as the city&#x27;s airport from 1933 and was Slovenia&#x27;s first civil airport. Regular flights from the new airport at Brnik began in January 1964.

In the 1980s, Jat Airways offered flights from Chicago to Belgrade that included a nonstop segment between New York City and Ljubljana. The airline employed McDonnell Douglas DC-10s on the route. However, the flight from Belgrade to Chicago did not stop in Ljubljana.

On 27 June 1991, two days after Slovenia&#x27;s Independence from Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army began its military operations within the country. The airport was bombed during the first day of the war. The next day, 28 June, two journalists from Austria and Germany, Nikolas Vogel and Norbert Werner, were killed from a missile that struck their car near the airport, where they were both driving by during that time. Four Adria Airways airliners also took serious damage from the Yugoslav Air Force.

Finally on 29 June, the JPA soldiers at the Airport surrendered to Slovenian TO forces, who surrounded the entire facility overnight. The fighting ended on 7 July with the Brioni Agreement.

On 8 December 2004, the airport received its first annual millionth passenger. Overall, the airport handled 1,721,355 passengers in 2019, representing a 5% drop in traffic figures compared to the previous year.

In 2007, the right-wing government proposed renaming the airport from &quot;Aerodrom Ljubljana&quot; to &quot;Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport&quot;. Jože Pučnik was a Slovene right-wing public intellectual, dissident, politician, and leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (Demos) between 1989 and 1992.

Due to growing air traffic and Slovenia&#x27;s EU entry, which requires the separation of traffic into Schengen and non-Schengen, Aerodrom Ljubljana Airport Authorities have prepared a redevelopment plan for the passenger terminal. The expansion was to be carried out in two phases. Works on the first phase began in early July 2007 to accommodate Slovenia&#x27;s entry into the Schengen Area in December 2007. The terminal building (T1) was extended with a new upper level which added an additional to the departure lounge and four jetways have also been installed for easier passenger access to and from the terminal. In 2013, the second phase of terminal expansion which included a new terminal T2 was scrapped by the minority stakeholders.

In 2014, the Slovenian government initiated a privatisation process of the airport. The bid was won by Fraport which, in turn, acquired a 75.5% stake in the airport. The remaining shares were acquired in the following months resulting in Fraport taking 100% ownership of the airport.

==Facilities==
===Runway===
The airport has a paved runway which is equipped with ILS Cat IIIb on runway 30. NDB and VOR approach are also available. The runway of Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport was closed to air traffic in April 2010 during which time, the entire length of the asphalt surface of the runway was renovated, as well as the asphalt surface on some parts of the taxiways.

===Expansion plan===
In April 2017 the airport operator Fraport Slovenia announced a plan to expand the existing passenger terminal. A modular solution was proposed which can be carried out in phases that are effectively and continuously adapted to traffic development needs.

The first phase of the terminal expansion was opened for traffic in July 2021. The capacity of the departures area was increased from 500 passengers per hour to 1,250 passengers per hour. A new extension was built to the west of the old terminal building. It includes a large duty-free shop, a new business lounge, one new air bridge, as well as renovated food &amp; beverage and promotional areas. There are 22 check-in desks and five long security lines available. A new baggage sorting area was also added and the baggage reclaim area was expanded and equipped with two long carousels.

The existing passenger terminal, which covers , was partly renovated and functionally incorporated with the new building. The construction began in July 2019 and was completed in June 2021 in time for Slovenia&#x27;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The entire renovated and expanded terminal complex covers a total of .

In 2017 Fraport Slovenija also published a revised Master Plan for the period 2010–2040. It includes a plan to construct a new cargo terminal to the east of the airport complex, expansion of passenger and aircraft maintenance aprons and a relocation of the general aviation apron to the west. To the north, a business and logistics center named Airport City is planned. It will include various business and logistic facilities as well as a new hotel, there are multiple subsidies as well as incentives for the potential investor. In January 2018 a new road from Kranj to Mengeš that will enable the development of the Airport City was opened.

===Busiest Routes from LJU in 2023===
==Ground transport==
The airport is served by an exit off the A2 motorway and by bus services connecting it with the surrounding cities of Ljubljana, Kranj, Kamnik as well as Klagenfurt and its airport in Austria. Plans for a railway line connecting the airport with the city of Ljubljana and possibly also Kranj and Kamnik have been presented in the past, however the line most likely won&#x27;t be built in the near future. The Airport is connected with many bigger Slovenian cities by bus and shuttle connections. Klagenfurt is connected by the Alpe Adria bus line. Other means of transportation to and from the airport are limited to the taxi services which are not controlled by the airport authority or Fraport Slovenija, and shared shuttle service with ticket sale point in the main arrival lobby.

<text>The DUKW (GMC type nomenclature, colloquially known as Duck) is a six-wheel-drive amphibious modification of the -ton CCKW trucks used by the U.S. military during World War II and the Korean War.

Designed by a partnership under military auspices of Sparkman &amp; Stephens and General Motors Corporation (GMC), the DUKW was used for the transportation of goods and troops over land and water. Excelling at approaching and crossing beaches in amphibious warfare attacks, it was intended only to last long enough to meet the demands of combat. Surviving DUKWs have since found popularity as tourist craft providing travel across aquatic areas.

==Etymology==
The name DUKW comes from General Motors Corporation model nomenclature:

* D, 1942 production series
* U, Utility
* K, all wheel drive
* W, tandem rear axles, both driven

Decades later, the designation was explained erroneously by writers such as Donald Clarke, who wrote in 1978 that it was an initialism for &quot;Duplex Universal Karrier, Wheeled&quot;.

The U.S. Navy-Marine Corps alternative designation of LVW (Landing Vehicle, Wheeled) was seldom used.

==History==
The DUKW was designed by Rod Stephens Jr. of Sparkman &amp; Stephens, Inc. yacht designers, Dennis Puleston, a British deep-water sailor resident in the U.S., and Frank W. Speir from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Developed by the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development to solve the problem of resupply to units which had just performed an amphibious landing, it was initially rejected by the armed services. When a United States Coast Guard patrol craft ran aground on a sand bar near Provincetown, Massachusetts, an experimental DUKW happened to be in the area for a demonstration. Winds up to , rain, and heavy surf prevented conventional craft from rescuing the seven stranded Coast Guardsmen, but the DUKW had no trouble, and military opposition to the DUKW melted. The DUKW later proved its seaworthiness by crossing the English Channel.

The final production design was perfected by a few engineers at Yellow Truck &amp; Coach in Pontiac, Michigan. The vehicle was built by Yellow Truck and Coach Co. (GMC Truck and Coach Div. after 1943) at their Pontiac West Assembly Plant and Chevrolet Div. of General Motors Corp. at their St. Louis Truck Assembly Plant; 21,147 were manufactured before production ended in 1945.

==Description==

The DUKW was built around the GMC AFKWX, a cab-over-engine (COE) version of the GMC CCKW six-wheel-drive military truck, with the addition of a watertight hull and a propeller. It was powered by a GMC Model 270 straight-six engine. A five-speed overdrive transmission drove a transfer case to drive the axles, then a two-speed transfer case for the propeller. The propeller and front axle were selectable from their respective transfer cases. A power take-off on the transmission drove an air-compressor and winch. It weighed empty and operated at on road and on water. It was long, wide, high with the folding-canvas top down and high with the top up.

It was not an armored vehicle, being plated with sheet steel between thick to minimize weight. A high-capacity bilge pump system kept it afloat if the thin hull was breached by holes up to in diameter. One in four DUKWs mounted a Browning heavy machine gun on a ring mount.

The DUKW was the first vehicle to allow the driver to vary the tire pressure from inside the cab. The tires could be fully inflated for hard surfaces such as roads and less inflated for softer surfaces, especially beach sand. This added to its versatility as an amphibious vehicle. This feature is now standard on many military vehicles.

==Service history==
=== World War II ===

The DUKW was supplied to the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and Allied forces, and 2,000 were supplied to Britain under the Lend-Lease program; 535 were acquired by Australian forces, and 586 were supplied to the Soviet Union, which built its own version, the BAV 485, after the war. 
DUKWs were initially sent to Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater, but were used by an invasion force for the first time in the European theater, during the Sicilian invasion, Operation Husky, in the Mediterranean.

They were used on the D-Day beaches of Normandy and in the Battle of the Scheldt, Operation Veritable, and Operation Plunder.

In the Pacific, USMC DUKWs were used to cross the coral reefs of islands such as Saipan and Guam and the tires were not affected by the coral.

Some DUKWs used in WWII were reported to have capsized while landing at Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion.

DUKWs were also used in Lake Garda in Italy by the 10th Mountain Division in the final days of the war. One sank while crossing from Torbole sul Garda to Riva del Garda on the evening of 30 April 1945, drowning 25 out of the 26 onboard. A documentary about the event, The Lost Mountaineers, premiered in 2023. Two other DUKWs used in operation sank without casualties.

===After the war===
After World War II, reduced numbers were kept in service by the United States, Britain, France, and Australia, with many stored pending disposal. Australia transferred many to Citizens Military Force units.

The U.S. Army reactivated and deployed several hundred at the outbreak of the Korean War with the 1st Transportation Replacement Training Group providing crew training. DUKWs were used extensively to bring supplies ashore during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and in the amphibious landings at Incheon.

Ex-U.S. Army DUKWs were transferred to the French military after World War II and were used by the Troupes de marine and naval commandos. Many were used for general utility duties in overseas territories. France deployed DUKWs to French Indochina during the First Indochina War. Some French DUKWs were given new hulls in the 1970s, with the last being retired in 1982.

Britain deployed DUKWs to Malaya during the Malayan Emergency of 1948–60. Many were redeployed to Borneo during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation of 1962–66.

===Later military use===
The Royal Marines used five of these vehicles for training at 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron, 1 Assault Group Royal Marines at Instow, North Devon. Four were manufactured between 1943 and 1945. The fifth is a DUKW hull copy manufactured in 1993 with unused World War II-vintage running gear parts. In 1999, a refurbishment programme began to extend their service life to 2014. DUKWs were removed from service in 2012.

The DUKWs were used for safety, allowing all ranks to undertake training drills for boat work for the landing craft ranks, and drivers undertaking wading drills from the Landing Craft Utility.

===Principal military users===

* United States
* Australia – 535
* Argentina
* Brazil
* Canada – about 800
* Dominican Republic
* France
* Philippines
* Iraq
* Soviet Union – 586
* United Kingdom – about 2,000
==Developments==

In the latter 1940s and throughout the 1950s, while Speir, now project engineer for the Army&#x27;s Amphibious Warfare Program, worked on &quot;bigger and better&quot; amphibious vehicles such as the &quot;Super Duck&quot;, the &quot;Drake&quot;, and the mammoth BARC (Barge, Amphibious, Resupply, Cargo), many DUKWs were made surplus and used as rescue vehicles by fire departments and Coast Guard stations.

In 1952, the Soviet Union produced a derivative, the BAV 485, adding a rear loading ramp. The Zavod imeni Stalina factory built it on the structure of its ZiS-151 truck, and production continued until 1962, with over 2,000 units delivered.

==Civilian use==
Many were used after WWII by civilian organizations such as the police, fire departments, and rescue units. DUKWs were used for oceanographic research in Northern California, as related by participant Willard Bascom. Drivers learned that DUKWS were capable of surfing large winter Pacific waves, with care (and luck).

The Australian Army lent two DUKWs and crew to Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions for a 1948 expedition to Macquarie Island. Australian DUKWs were used on Antarctic supply voyages until 1970. From 1945 to 1965, the Australian Commonwealth Lighthouse Service supply ship &quot;Cape York&quot; carried ex-Army DUKWs for supplying lighthouses on remote islands.

One DUKW is in use by the Technisches Hilfswerk (THW) of Germersheim in Germany, a civil protection organisation.

==Tourist attractions==
DUKWs are still in use as tourist transport in harbor and river cities across the globe. The first &quot;duck tour&quot; company was started in 1946 by Mel Flath in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The company is still in operation under the name Original Wisconsin Ducks.

<text>[[Kent]] is a traditional county in South East England with long-established human occupation.

==Prehistoric Kent==
Recent excavations and radiometric dating at a Lower Palaeolithic site at the West Gravel Pit, Fordwich, near Canterbury confirmed the presence of early humans in the area between 560,000 and 620,000 years ago during a warming phase (Marine isotope stage 15). They may have been Homo heidelbergensis or an early form of Neanderthal man. This is the earliest securely dated site with Acheulean stone tools in Britain. It is the first dated evidence for human habitation in Kent before the Anglian Glaciation, the most severe glaciation of the last two million years.
The Swanscombe skull, uncovered at Barnfield Pit, a quarry in Swanscombe, is the oldest human skull found in Britain. It is difficult to say much about the three fragments of skull from one individual, as they are all from the rear of the skull, but Chris Stringer suggests that they come from a female, some of whose characteristics suggest she is from a population ancestral to Neanderthals. It dates to the Hoxnian Interglacial, a warming period 400,000 years ago.

In June 2023 researchers from UCL Archaeology Southeast over 800 stone tools, including two giant handles dating to over 300,000 years ago, were discovered on a hillside near Medway Valley in Frindsbury near Stroud. At the time the area was a wild landscape of forests and river valleys with animals including red deer, straight-tusked elephants, lions and horses.
During the Neolithic the Medway megaliths were built and there is a rich sequence of Bronze Age occupation indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup.

==Iron Age Kent==
The name Kent probably means &#x27;rim&#x27; or &#x27;border&#x27; (compare the dictionary words cant in English, Kant in German, etc.), regarding the eastern part of the modern county as a &#x27;border land&#x27; or &#x27;coastal district.&#x27; Historical linguists believe that the proto-Indo-European root *kanthos could not pass into a Germanic language with its initial K sound intact, so the word must have passed via an intermediate language, either Celtic or Latin. Julius Caesar described it as Cantium, although he did not record the inhabitants&#x27; name for themselves, in 51 BC. His writings suggest localised groups of people whose chieftains were flattered by his description of them as &#x27;kings&#x27;. Writing of the Britons generally in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; Caesar noted that: &quot;...by far the most civilised are those who inhabit Cantium, the whole of which is a maritime region; and their manners differ little from those of the Gauls&quot;. Pottery studies indicate the county east of the River Medway was inhabited by Belgic peoples who were part of an economic and cultural region embracing south east England and the lands across the English Channel.

The extreme west of the modern county was occupied by other Celtic Iron Age tribes; the Regni and possibly another ethnic group occupying The Weald known today as the Wealden People. During the late pre-Roman Iron Age the names of a few British kings are known, such as Dumnovellaunus and Adminius. An Iron Age settlement seems to have formed the basis for the later town of Folkestone, whilst a hillfort of that date seems to be the forerunner of Dover Castle.

==Roman Kent==

Although now two miles from the sea amid the marshes of east Kent, Richborough Roman fort was arguably the Romans&#x27; main entry point when they invaded Britain in circa AD 43. They established a bridgehead and commemorated their success by building a triumphal arch whose cross shaped foundations still survive at the site which is now looked after by English Heritage.

Roman Britain was under attack by Saxon and other raiders in the 3rd century and it became necessary to fortify the once-prosperous commercial port of Rutupiae. Triple ditches and ramparts were dug (still visible round the site of the arch Richborough Roman fort although the defences were completely revamped after a decade or so and Richborough was provided with its circuit of towered stone walls and outer ditches, becoming one of the most important of the Saxon shore forts. It was one of the last to be regularly occupied and there is evidence of a large Roman population here in the early 5th century, some of them worshipping in the early Christian church discovered in a corner of the fort.

==Early Medieval Kent==
Following the withdrawal of the Romans, a large-scale immigration of Germanic peoples occurred in Kent. These groups introduced the Old English language to Britain. It is likely that some of the native Romano-Britons remained in the area, however, as they were able to influence its name (recorded as Cantia or Cent) even after the settlement of the Germanic tribes. East Kent became one of the kingdoms of the Jutes during the 5th century (see Kingdom of Kent). The early Medieval inhabitants of the county were known as the Cantwara or Kentish people, whose capital (the only town called a metropolis by Bede) was at Canterbury.

Canterbury is the religious centre of the Anglican faith, and see of Saint Augustine of Canterbury. Augustine is traditionally credited with bringing Christianity to Anglo Saxon England, landing at Ebbsfleet, Pegwell Bay on the Isle of Thanet (northeast of Kent) in the spring of 597. 

A lathe was an ancient administration division of Kent, and may well have originated during the Jutish colonisation of the county. These ancient divisions still exist, but have no administrative significance today. There were seven Lathes in Kent at the time of the Domesday Book, which reveals that in 1086 Kent was divided into the seven lathes or &quot;lest(um)&quot;: Aylesford, Milton, Sutton, Borough, Eastry, Lympne and Wye. For administrative, judicial and taxation purposes these units remained important for another 600 years, although by 1295 the number of lathes had reduced to five: Borough and Eastry were merged to form the Lathe of St. Augustine, the lathe of Lympne was renamed the Lathe of Shepway, the lathes of Milton and Wye were merged to form the Lathe of Scray. Each of the lathes were divided into smaller areas called hundreds, although the difference between the functions of lathes and hundreds remains unclear.

==Medieval Kent==
Following the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy the people of Kent adopted the motto &quot;Invicta&quot; meaning &quot;unconquered&quot; and claimed that they had frightened the Normans away. This claim was given credence by the fact that the Normans had quickly marched to London without subduing the Kentish lords and peasantry, constantly harassed and ambushed by the Kentish populace at every turn. Kent did not submit to Norman rule until their rights and privileges had been acknowledged and unmolested. As a result, Kent became a semi-autonomous County Palatine under William&#x27;s half-brother Odo of Bayeux, with the special powers otherwise reserved for counties bordering Wales and Scotland. A decade after the Norman conquest, Penenden Heath near Maidstone was the scene of a successful trial of Odo of Bayeux. The trial, ordered by William I at the behest of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury challenged the Earl&#x27;s purported landholdings in the county, an event which represented an important attempt by Saxon landowners to reassert their pre-Norman rights and privileges.

&quot;Gavelkind&quot; was an example of customary law in England. After the Norman Conquest, gavelkind was superseded by the feudal law of primogeniture in the rest of England, but in Kent gavelkind meant that on death, a man&#x27;s property was equally divided amongst his surviving sons, which led to land being divided into ever smaller parcels. Therefore, the strip system of farming in open fields was never established in Kent. This gives evidence to the Invicta legend and seems to support that, at least among smaller land owners and common folk, Normans, were forced to respect Kentish rights and law. &quot;Gavelkind&quot; was finally abolished by the Law of Property Act in 1925.

Canterbury became a great pilgrimage site following the martyrdom of Thomas Becket (1119/20–1170), who was eventually canonised in 1246. Canterbury&#x27;s religious role also gave rise to Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, a key development in the rise of the written English language and ostensibly set in the countryside of Kent. Rochester had its own martyr, William of Perth, and in 1256 Lawrence, Bishop of Rochester travelled to Rome to obtain William&#x27;s canonisation.

During the medieval period, Kent produced several rebellions including the Peasants&#x27; Revolt led by Wat Tyler and later, Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450. Thomas Wyatt led an army into London from Kent in 1553, against Mary I.

As well as numerous fortified manor houses, Kent has a number of traditional militarily significant castles, including those at Allington, Chilham, Dover, Hever, Leeds, Rochester and Walmer, built to protect the coast, the River Medway or routes into London.

==Early Modern Kent==
The Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547 when a storehouse was rented on &#x27;Jyllingham Water&#x27;. By the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) a small dockyard had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock and houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham.

By the 17th century, tensions between Britain and the continental powers of the Netherlands and France led to increasing military build-up in the county. Forts were built along the coast following a raid by the Dutch navy on the shipyards of the Medway towns in 1667. Kent also played a significant role in the English Civil War around 1648.

The 18th century was dominated with wars with France, and the Medway became the prime position to base a fleet that would act against the Dutch and French Coasts. When the theatre of operation moved to the Atlantic, Portsmouth and Plymouth assumed these roles and Chatham concentrated on shipbuilding and ship repair. Many of the Georgian naval buildings are still extant. In peacetime the work force at Chatham Dockyard was reduced to a quarter of its wartime roll.

Chatham Dockyard built over 400 naval ships including in the age of ships of the line, ironclads including 1905, and 57 submarines, while also refitting ships. The keel for HMS &quot;Victory&quot; was laid at Chatham on 23 July 1759. During World War II, Chatham refitted 1360 warships such as HMS &quot;Ajax&quot;. Charles Dickens&#x27; father worked in the dockyard, and Chatham, Rochester and the Cliffe marshes were to feature in many of his books.

As an indication of the area&#x27;s military importance, the first Ordnance Survey map ever drawn was the 1 inch map of Kent, published in 1801. Work on the map started in 1795.

In the early 19th century smugglers were very active on the Kent coastline, with gangs, such as the Aldington Gang bringing spirits, tobacco and salt to Kent, taking goods like wool across the English Channel to France.

On Saturday night, 28 August 1830, a widespread uprising by rural workers began in East Kent, with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area and by the third week of October, over one hundred machines had been destroyed. 
The uprising, that eventually became known as the Swing Riots, spread across southern England and East Anglia. The general unrest, particularly about the state of the workhouses, was instrumental in the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.

== Recent discoveries ==
In May 2019, Kent Archaeological Field School uncovered a Roman building at Abbey Farm. According to the Dr. Paul Wilkinson, the building contained broken stone walls covering huge amounts of box flue tiles, which were used to direct hot air up the indoor walls, glazed terracotta floors, an untouched underfloor with hypocaust heating and tons of ceramic roof tiles. Although the plaster painted from these walls were mostly white, plaster walls coloured with green, red and yellow panels were found in the hot sauna room on the north side of the building.

==Kent and London==

As London developed over time, especially during the 19th century, it expanded into north-west Kent. Settlements in this area became urbanised and increasingly regarded as suburbs of London. This view became stronger as local government areas in the region were created that were more closely aligned with London than with Kent.

An administrative area known as the County of London was created by the Local Government Act 1888. The new county incorporated part of north west Kent including Deptford, Greenwich, Woolwich and Lewisham. Penge was gained from Surrey by the London Government Act 1899.

The London Government Act 1963 created an enlarged Greater London in 1965 which took in more of northwest Kent. The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the previous structure of local government in 1974 and created a new non-metropolitan county of Kent, divided into districts. It also abolished Canterbury as a county borough which became a district under the new county council. The places that had been removed in 1888 were amalgamated to form the London Borough of Lewisham and the Royal Borough of Greenwich and two further boroughs were created. These were the London Borough of Bromley, an amalgamation of Bromley, Beckenham, Chislehurst, Orpington and Penge and the London Borough of Bexley comprising Bexley, Sidcup, Erith and Crayford.

==Modern Kent==
Much of the Battle of Britain during World War II was fought in the skies over the county, and between June 1944 and March 1945, over 10,000 V1 flying bombs, or &quot;Doodlebugs,&quot; were fired on London from bases in Northern France. Many were destroyed by aircraft, anti-aircraft guns or barrage balloons, but around 2500 fell on the capital - but almost the same number fell in Kent, and the area became known as &quot;Doodlebug Alley&quot;. The town of Deal was also the target for a 1989 attack by the IRA.

Much of the north-west of the county is part of the London commuter belt. The Thames Gateway regeneration area includes riverside areas of north Kent as far east as Sittingbourne and largely to the north of the A2 road. Much of Kent, especially the Medway area, saw post-war migration from London. This was partly because of the heavy damage and destruction sustained by London in World War II.

In 1998, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham and Rainham left the administrative county of Kent to form the Unitary Authority of Medway, but remain in the ceremonial county of Kent.

The two cities in Kent were Canterbury, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Rochester, the seat of the Bishop of Rochester. However, since 1998 when local government was reorganised, Rochester lost its official city status, thought at the time to be through an administrative oversight. In 2018, it was reported that the loss of city status was not accidental.

==Men of Kent and Kentish Men==
Kent is traditionally divided into East Kent and West Kent and such a division can be traced back at least as far as the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Kent. Those from the East are known as &quot;Men of Kent&quot; (or &quot;Maids of Kent&quot;) and those from the West as &quot;Kentish Men&quot; (or &quot;Kentish Maids&quot;).

===Iron Age and Roman Period===
Julius Caesar called Kent, Cantium, and the pre-Roman local tribe the Cantiaci subsequently become a civitas (unit of local administration) of Roman Britain, based at Durovernum Cantiacorum (modern Canterbury). The Germanic settlers adopted the Romano-British name of Cantium and this lends weight to the idea that civitas passed from British to Germanic (Jutish) hands with its structure essentially intact. The civitas territory &quot;may&quot; only have consisted of East Kent so the origins of the sub-divisions of Kent may thus go back to the Iron Age.

===Anglo-Saxon Period===
The East and West Kentish identities date back at least as far as the Anglo-Saxon period. In the early days of the English church it was usual for kingdoms, even large ones like Mercia and Northumbria, to be served by just one diocese, but Kent was unique in having two, Rochester in the west, and Canterbury in the east.

This seems to have reflected political divisions with eastern and western political units in place at that time. In the late 7th century, Kent is recorded as being under the control of co-Kings, one in the west (Swaefherd, of the East Saxon royal house) and one in the east – both of these being under the overlordship of Aethelred of Mercia.

These political divisions may reflect the varying ethnic make-up of the leadership of Kent at that time, the difference being between the Jutes who settled in the east and south of the county shortly after the Roman armies&#x27; departure early in the 5th century and the Angles and Saxon who may have settled in the west of the county slightly later, or simply a divided, decentralized Jutish kingdom. Modern DNA testing suggests the people of Kent have a greater genetic affinity with each other than persons from other counties in England.

F. F. Smith&#x27;s 1929 work &quot;A History of Rocheste&quot;r quotes a 1735 glossary by the Rev. Samuel Pegge on the subject:

The history of early Anglo-Saxon England is very uncertain and prone to re-interpretation according to the fashion of the time. A Jutish elite may have formed their kingdom in the east, expelling or absorbing rival tribes and Jutish kings settling the land with their own followers until the kingdom reached its traditional borders, as was customary across Britain during the initial Anglo-Saxon invasions and settlement. Whatever the case, Jutish cultural influence was evident across the whole county by the Norman period.

According to the BBC website, legend holds that a few hundred years later, it is said the Men of Kent resisted William the Conqueror more stoutly than the Kentish Men, who surrendered.

===Boundaries and usage===
Kent is traditionally divided into East Kent and West Kent by the River Medway. However, some towns, such as the Medway Towns – Rochester, Chatham and Gillingham (although Rainham was annexed from Swale, and is thus considered part of East Kent) and Maidstone – lie on the east / south bank of the river.

The historic area of West Kent included a number of places now in Greater London; specifically the London Boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich and Lewisham. This included locations such as Sidcup, Orpington, and Greenwich.

Further investigation also shows that the division is not, in fact, the river Medway, but lies further east in Gillingham, or, more precisely, at Rainham. Along the London road at Rainham is a small hamlet, now part of the town itself, known as Rainham Mark. Here once stood an ancient boundary stone, near &quot;The Hops and Vine&quot; public house – formerly &quot;The Belisha Beacon&quot; – and since replaced by a milestone that, traditionally, marks the division of Kent into its eastern and western zones. Edward Hasted, in his 1798 description of Rainham, writes:

 According to one local historian, Freddie Cooper, a former mayor of Gillingham, this division remained in force until 1 April 1929 when Rainham was transferred, despite protest, from the administration of Milton Rural District Council to that of Gillingham.

F. F. Smith&#x27;s 1929 work &quot;A History of Rochester&quot; quotes a 1735 glossary by the Rev. Samuel Pegge on the subject:

One example of this traditional subdivision are Kent&#x27;s two historic local regiments, the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment and the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), now both part of the Princess of Wales&#x27; Royal Regiment. Another is its two historical parliamentary constituencies, West Kent and East Kent. West Kent and East Kent each had their own Quarter Sessions until 1814, when the separate administrations of East and West Kent were merged. The West Kent Quarter Sessions Division was based in Maidstone and consisted of the Lathe of Aylesford, the Lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, and the lower division of the Lathe of Scray. The East Kent Quarter Session, corresponding roughly to the Diocese of Canterbury, consisted of the three lathes: Lathe of St Augustine, Lathe of Shepway, and the upper division of the Lathe of Scray. The distinction between these two-halves of the county is perpetuated in the present-day by the Association of the Men of Kent and Kentish Men, an organisation formed in 1913.

==Nickname==
Most English counties have nicknames for people from that county, such as a Tyke from Yorkshire and a Yellowbelly from Lincolnshire; the traditional nickname for people from Kent is &quot;Kentish Long-Tail&quot;, deriving from the long-held belief on the continental mainland of Medieval Europe that the English had tails.

<text>Alban Butler (13 October 171015 May 1773) was an English Roman Catholic priest and hagiographer. Born in Northamptonshire, he studied at the English College, in Douay, France where he later taught philosophy and theology. He served as guide on the Grand Tour to the nephews of the Earl of Shrewsbury. Upon his return in 1749, Butler was made chaplain to the Duke of Norfolk. He was appointed president of the English seminary at Saint Omer in France. Butler is mainly known for his &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot;, the result of thirty years of work.

== Biography ==
Alban Butler was born in 1710, at Appletree, Aston le Walls, Northamptonshire, the second son of Simon Butler, Esq. His father died when he was young and he was sent to the Lancashire boarding school run by Dame Alice. He went on to a Catholic further education at the English College, Douai, in France. In 1735 Butler was ordained a priest. At Douai, he was appointed professor of philosophy, and later professor of theology. It was at Douai that he began his principal work &quot;The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints&quot;. He also prepared material for Richard Challoner&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of Missionary Priests&quot;, a work on the martyrs of the reign of Elizabeth.

In 1745, Butler came to the attention of the Duke of Cumberland, younger son of King George II, for his devotion to the wounded English soldiers during the defeat at the Battle of Fontenoy.

Around 1746, Butler served as tutor and guide on the Grand Tour to James and Thomas Talbot, nephews of Gilbert Talbot, 13th Earl of Shrewsbury. Their elder brother, George, succeeded their uncle as 14th Earl of Shrewsbury. Both James and Thomas Talbot later became Catholic bishops.

Butler returned to England in 1749 and was made chaplain to the Duke of Norfolk, whose nephew and heir, the Hon. Edward Howard, Butler accompanied to Paris as tutor. While he was in Paris, Butler completed his &quot;Lives&quot;.

He laboured for some time as a missionary priest in Staffordshire, and was finally appointed president of the English seminary at Saint Omer in France, where he remained until his death. During his term as President of the English seminary, Butler also served the bishops of Arras, Saint-Omer, Ypres, and Boulogne-Sur-Mer as their Vicar-General. Butler died in Saint-Omer in 1773 and was buried in the parish church of Saint-Denis.

See &quot;An Account of the Life of A. B. by C. B.&quot;, i.e. by his nephew Charles Butler (London, 1799); and Joseph Gillow&#x27;s &quot;Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics&quot;, vol. i.

== &quot;The Lives of Saints&quot; ==

Butler&#x27;s great work, &quot;The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints&quot; (&quot;Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;&quot;), the result of thirty years&#x27; study, was first published in four volumes in London, 1756–1759. It is a popular and compendious reproduction of the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, exhibiting great industry and research, and is in all respects the best compendium of &quot;Acta&quot; in English. Butler&#x27;s magnum opus has passed many editions and translations.

=== The first edition (1756–1759) ===
This edition was printed initially in 4 octavo volumes, with no stated publisher or author&#x27;s name. However they were so thick that they were usually bound in more volumes. There were actually 6 title pages since Vol. 3 and Vol. 4 both have a &quot;part 2&quot; issued thus: vol. 1, vol. 2, vol. 3, vol. 3 part 2, vol. 4, and vol. 4 part 2. Each &quot;volume&quot; contained three months of the liturgical calendar&#x27;s Saints&#x27; lives. Vol. 1 also had a copperplate engraving with figures of the Roman devices of torture used, and a 2-page explanation of their use.

Charles Butler&#x27;s assertion that &quot;all the notes&quot; were left out of the first edition at the suggestion of Bishop Challoner is exaggerated. There are many useful, and even extended, notes in the first edition, but not to the extent that they appear in the second, and succeeding editions. According to Charles Knight, the 1847 edition published in twelve volumes is considered the best and most complete.

===Modern editions===
Since Fr. Butler published his original edition of his &quot;Lives&quot;, many successors have revised and updated the work. Father Herbert Thurston, SJ, edited and significantly rewrote the work; his 12-volume &quot;Revised Edition&quot; was published between 1926 and 1938.

<doc id="1139271" wikidata="Q86521" url="?curid=1139271" title="MMM (Ponzi scheme company)">
<text>МММ was a Russian company that perpetrated one of the world&#x27;s largest Ponzi schemes of all time, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By different estimates from 5 to 10 million people lost their savings. According to contemporary Western press reports, most investors were aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme, but still hoped to profit from it by withdrawing money before it collapsed.

In 2011, MMM re-opened as &quot;MMM Global&quot;.

==History==
MMM was established in 1989 by Sergei Mavrodi, his brother Vyacheslav Mavrodi, and Olga Melnikova. The name of the company was taken from the first letters of the three founders&#x27; surnames.

Initially, Mavrodi operated a network of computer-importing cooperatives. In January 1992, tax police accused MMM of tax evasion, leading to the collapse of MMM&#x27;s internal bank, and causing the company to have difficulty obtaining financing to support its operations. Faced with difficulties in funding its foreign trade, the company switched to the financial sector. It offered American stocks to Russian investors, but met with little success. In December 1992, MMM-Invest was created as a voucher investment fund, a type of entity created to collect privatization vouchers. It was renamed Russ-Invest in May 1995, to distance it from the MMM scheme.

The MMM Ponzi scheme was launched in February 1994, promising annual returns of up to %. The company started an aggressive TV ad campaign, spending 330 million rubles in March 1994. The ad campaign appealed to the general public by using &quot;ordinary&quot; characters that viewers could identify with. The most famous of them, a &quot;folk hero&quot; of early 1994, was Lyonya Golubkov. Another notable marketing effort was a giveaway of free Metro trips to all Moscow citizens on a particular day.

At its peak the company was taking in millions of US dollars each day from the sale of its shares to the public. Mavrodi reportedly owned enough cash to pack several rooms full with banknotes. The success of MMM in attracting investors led to the creation of other similar companies, including Tibet, Chara, Khoper-Invest, Selenga, Telemarket and Germes. All of these companies were characterised by aggressive television advertising and extremely high promised rates of return. One company promised annual returns of %.

Regular publication in the media of the rising MMM share price led President Boris Yeltsin to issue a decree in June 1994 to protect investors from false advertising.

On 22 July 1994, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement listing MMM among a number of investment firms which had illegally issued unregistered securities. Thousands of investors protested in front of the company headquarters, prompting the intervention of riot police. By the next day, the firm was no longer operational. The company attempted to continue the scheme for a few days, and even issued new shares. As Russia did not have any laws against Ponzi schemes, the government decided to seek tax evasion charges. At that point, Invest-Consulting, one of the company&#x27;s subsidiaries, owed more than 50 billion rubles in taxes (US$23 billion in 1994), and MMM itself owed between 100 billion and 3 trillion rubles to the investors (from US$50 million to US$1.5 billion). MMM shares fell from 115,000 rubles to 1,000 rubles. In the aftermath, some investors reportedly threatened to set themselves on fire.

Several organisations of &quot;investors&quot; made efforts to recover their lost investments, but Sergei Mavrodi manipulated their indignation and directed it at the government. Mavrodi was arrested on tax evasion charges, unrelated to the MMM scheme, on 4 August 1994. Most shareholders blamed the government for their losses. A &#x27;Union of Defense of the Rights of MMM Shareholders&#x27; emerged, attempting to collect the 1 million signatures required to hold a no-confidence referendum against Yeltsin&#x27;s government.

In October 1994 Mavrodi managed to win a by-election to replace Andrey Aizderdzis in the State Duma, and with it immunity from prosecution. Mavrodi claimed to be the victim of jealous bureaucrats, and that MMM shares would regain their value if he was elected. During the campaign he was supported by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who hoped that Mavrodi would provide him with future financial backing. After being elected he appeared in the State Duma only once, to vote against an attempt to strip him of parliamentary immunity.

Mavrodi launched his own political party, the Party of People&#x27;s Capital, but it was barred from registering after violating election laws. He decided to stage a protest against a decision, but this time only 200 people showed up. In October 1995, the Duma cancelled Mavrodi&#x27;s right to immunity as a deputy. In 1996, he tried to run for Russia&#x27;s presidency, but his bid was rejected after officials ruled that most of the signatures he submitted had been forged. MMM declared bankruptcy on September 22, 1997.

The original investigation was closed in 1997 for lack of evidence. The Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office reopened the case in 1998, when Mavrodi was investigated for fraud and placed on an international wanted list. While it was believed that Sergei Mavrodi fled to Greece, he was ultimately arrested in Moscow, and investigators concluded that he probably never left the city.

Mavrodi was found and arrested in February 2003. While in custody, Mavrodi was given until 31 January 2006 to read the documents in his fraud case against him (the criminal case consisted of 650 volumes, each 250-270 pages long). At the end of April 2007, Mavrodi was convicted of fraud, and given a sentence of four-and-a-half years. Since he had already spent over four years in custody, he was released less than a month later, on 22 May 2007.

Though no longer current, MMM &quot;Bilets&quot; share certificates, which bear a resemblance to banknotes and formerly issued in ‘denominations’ of varying amounts, have gained some interest as collectors items.

The MMM scandal led to increased regulation of the Russian stock market, but the legacy of the fraud led many to become extremely suspicious of any joint stock companies.

== Fraud scheme in developing countries ==
From 2011, Mavrodi started targeting developing countries in Asia and Africa, promising 30% monthly returns and other promotional offers. It claimed that this was not a high-yield investment program (HYIP). Rather it was mentioned on the website that a group of people were &quot;selflessly helping each other&quot; in a form of &quot;Global Fund of mutual aid.&quot; Participants were asked to send financial help to fellows with the promise that they would be helped when in need by returning a sum more than what they had sent. In India, for example, many victims of this scheme reported that once they sent the &quot;help&quot;, they received messages saying that the system has restarted and they could no longer access their investments.

<text>Justin Detter (born August 7, 1982) is an American retired soccer player who played as a forward for Major League Soccer club Kansas City Wizards. He retired in 2005 citing poor pay ($18,500/year) as his primary factor in his decision.

Detter went to Holly High School and played club soccer at the Detroit club, Vardar. He moved to playing professional soccer via IMG Academy in Bradenton and with the U.S. U-17 national team. After graduating from Bradenton, Detter moved to college soccer at the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 2000 to 2003. Detter was a starter in all four years at Notre Dame. In his senior season, after moving from midfield to forward, he scored 14 goals with 8 assists and was selected for the All-Big East first team. He finished his college career with 38 goals and 28 assists.

On graduating, Detter was selected 47th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. He struggled to be given playing time behind Josh Wolff, Davy Arnaud and Matt Taylor, and he had to undergo two sports hernia surgeries and finished the season with only 162 minutes from six games. During his short career in the MLS, Detter was a U.S. Open Cup champion and a 2004 MLS Cup runner-up.

<doc id="1139275" wikidata="Q1779660" url="?curid=1139275" title="Private good">
<text>A private good is defined in economics as &quot;an item that yields positive benefits to people&quot; that is excludable, i.e. its owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits; and rivalrous, i.e. consumption by one necessarily prevents that of another. A private good, as an economic resource is scarce, which can cause competition for it. The market demand curve for a private good is a horizontal summation of individual demand curves.

Unlike public goods, such as clean air or national defense, private goods are less likely to have the free rider problem, in which a person benefits from a public good without contributing towards it. Assuming a private good is valued positively by everyone, the efficiency of obtaining the good is obstructed by its rivalry; that is simultaneous consumption of a rivalrous good is theoretically impossible. The feasibility of obtaining the good is made difficult by its excludability, which means that is people have to pay for it to enjoy its benefits.

One of the most common ways of looking at goods in the economy is by examining the level of competition in obtaining a given good, and the possibility of excluding its consumption; one cannot, for example, prevent another from enjoying a beautiful view in a public park, or clean air.

==Definition matrix==
== Example of a private good ==
An example of the private good is bread: bread eaten by a given person cannot be consumed by another (rivalry), and it is easy for a baker to refuse to trade a loaf (exclusive).

To illustrate the horizontal summation characteristic, assume there are only two people in this economy and that:
* Person A will purchase: 0 loaves of bread at $4, 1 loaf of bread at $3, 2 loaves of bread at $2, and 3 loaves of bread at $1
* Person B will purchase: 0 loaves of bread at $6, 1 loaf of bread at $5, 2 loaves of bread at $4, 3 loaves of bread at $3, 4 loaves of bread at $2, and 5 loaves of bread at $1

As a result, a new market demand curve can be derived with the following results:

<doc id="1139278" wikidata="Q5775409" url="?curid=1139278" title="History of Bristol">
<text>Bristol is a city with a population of nearly half a million people in south west England, situated between Somerset and Gloucestershire on the tidal River Avon. It has been among the country&#x27;s largest and most economically and culturally important cities for eight centuries. The Bristol area has been settled since the Stone Age and there is evidence of Roman occupation. A mint was established in the Saxon burgh of &quot;Brycgstow&quot; by the 10th century and the town rose to prominence in the Norman era, gaining a charter and county status in 1373. The change in the form of the name &#x27;Bristol&#x27; is due to the local pronunciation of &#x27;ow&#x27; as &#x27;ol&#x27;.

Maritime connections to Wales, Ireland, Iceland, western France, Spain and Portugal brought a steady increase in trade in wool, fish, wine and grain during the Middle Ages. Bristol became a city in 1542 and trade across the Atlantic developed. The city was captured by Royalist troops and then recaptured for Parliament during the English Civil War. During the 17th and 18th centuries the transatlantic slave trade and the Industrial Revolution brought further prosperity. Edmund Burke, MP for Bristol, supported the American Revolution and free trade. Prominent reformers such as Mary Carpenter and Hannah More campaigned against the slave trade.

The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the construction of a floating harbour, advances in shipbuilding and further industrialisation with the growth of the glass, paper, soap and chemical industries aided by the establishment of Bristol as the terminus of the Great Western Railway by I. K. Brunel. In the early 20th century, Bristol was in the forefront of aircraft manufacture and the city had become an important financial centre and high technology hub by the beginning of the 21st century.

==Pre-Norman==
===Palaeolithic and Iron Age===
There is evidence of settlement in the Bristol area from the palaeolithic era, with 60,000-year-old archaeological finds at Shirehampton and St Annes. Stone tools made from flint, chert, sandstone and quartzite have been found in terraces of the River Avon, most notably in the neighbourhoods of Shirehampton and Pill. There are Iron Age hill forts near the city, at Leigh Woods and Clifton Down on either side of the Avon Gorge, and at Kingsweston, near Henbury. Bristol was at that time part of the territory of the Dobunni. Evidence of Iron Age farmsteads has been found at excavations throughout Bristol, including a settlement at Filwood. There are also indications of seasonal occupation of the salt marshes at Hallen on the Severn estuary.

===Roman era===
During the Roman era there was a settlement named &quot;Abona&quot; at the present Sea Mills; this was important enough to feature in the 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary which documents towns and distances in the Roman empire, and was connected to Bath by a road. Archaeological excavations at &quot;Abona&quot; have found a street pattern, shops, cemeteries and wharves, indicating that the town served as a port. Another settlement at what is now Inns Court, Filwood, had possibly developed from earlier Iron Age farmsteads. There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area, notably Kings Weston Roman Villa and another at Brislington.

===Saxon era===
A minster was founded in the 8th century at Westbury on Trym and is mentioned in a charter of 804. In 946 an outlaw named Leof killed Edmund I in a brawl at a feast in the royal palace at Pucklechurch, which lies about six miles from Bristol. The town of Bristol was founded on a low hill between the rivers Frome and Avon at some time before the early 11th century. The main evidence for this is a coin of Aethelred issued c. 1010. This shows that the settlement must have been a market town and the name &quot;Brycg stowe&quot; indicates &quot;place by the bridge&quot;. It is believed that the &quot;Bristol L&quot; (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what changed the name &quot;Brycg stowe&quot; to the current name &quot;Bristol&quot;.

It appears that St Peter&#x27;s church, the remains of which stand in modern Castle Park, may have been another minster, possibly with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding for a mere parish church. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to &quot;Brycgstow&quot; and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating the status of the town as a port.

&quot;Brycg stowe&quot; was a major centre for the Anglo-Saxon slave trade. Men, women and children captured in Wales or northern England were traded through Bristol to Dublin as slaves. From there the Viking rulers of Dublin would sell them on throughout the known world. The Saxon bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, whose diocese included Bristol, preached against the trade regularly and eventually it was forbidden by the crown, though it carried on in secret for many years.

==Middle Ages==
===Norman era===


At some time after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 a motte-and-bailey was erected on the present site of Castle Park. Bristol was held by Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Countances, one of the knights who accompanied William the Conqueror. William ordered stone castles to be built so it is likely that the first parts of Bristol Castle were built by Geoffrey in his reign. After the Conqueror&#x27;s death (1087), Geoffrey joined the rebellion against William Rufus. Using Bristol as his headquarters, he burned Bath and ravaged Somerset before submitting to Rufus. He eventually returned to Normandy and died at Coutances in 1093.

Rufus created the Honour of Gloucester, which included Bristol, from his mother Queen Matilda&#x27;s estates and granted it to Robert Fitzhamon. Fitzhamon enlarged and strengthened Bristol castle and in the latter years of the 11th century conquered and subdued much of south and west Wales. His daughter Mabel was married in 1114 to Henry I&#x27;s bastard son Robert of Caen. Her dowry was a large part of her father&#x27;s Gloucestershire and Welsh estate and Robert of Caen became the first Earl of Gloucester, c. 1122. He is believed to have been responsible for completing Bristol castle.

In 1135 Henry I died and the Earl of Gloucester rallied to the support of his sister Matilda against Stephen of Blois who had seized the throne on Henry&#x27;s death. Stephen attempted to lay siege to Robert at Bristol in 1138 but gave up the attempt as the castle appeared impregnable. When Stephen was captured in 1141 he was imprisoned in the castle, but when Robert was captured by Stephen&#x27;s forces, Matilda was forced to exchange Stephen for Robert. Her son Henry, later to become Henry II of England, was kept safe in the castle, guarded and educated by his uncle Robert. The castle was later taken into royal hands, and Henry III spent lavishly on it, adding a barbican before the main west gate, a gate tower, and magnificent hall. The castle was also used to imprison Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany from 1224, under relatively comfortable conditions, almost to her death in 1241.

The Earl of Gloucester had founded the Benedictine priory of St James in 1137. In 1140 St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey was founded by Robert Fitzharding, a wealthy Bristolian who had loyally supported the Earl and Matilda in the war. As a reward for this support he would later be made Lord of Berkeley. The abbey was a monastery of Augustinian canons. In 1148 the abbey church was dedicated by the bishops of Exeter, Llandaff, and St. Asaph, and during Fitzharding&#x27;s lifetime the abbey also built the chapter house and gatehouse.

In 1172, following the subjugation of the &quot;Pale&quot; in Ireland, Henry II gave Bristolians the right to reside in and trade from Dublin.

The medieval Jewish community of Bristol was one of the smaller communities in England. The Jews of Bristol were accused in a blood libel in 1183, but not many details are known. At the end of the 12th century, an archa was established in the city, without which Jews would not have been legally allowed to conduct business. In 1210, all Jewish householders in England were imprisoned in Bristol and a hefty levy of 60,000 or 66,000 marks was imposed on them. During the Second Barons&#x27; War, the city&#x27;s archa was burned and the Jewish community was violently attacked. There was another attack in 1275, but without fatalities. The community was expelled with the rest of England&#x27;s Jews in 1290. There is a surviving Jewish ritual bath, from this time period now known as Jacob&#x27;s Well. First interpreted as a mikveh, this was subsequently re-evaluated as a Bet Tohorah, associated with the nearby Jewish cemetery at Jews Acre.

===Later Middle Ages===
By the 13th century Bristol had become a busy port. Woollen cloth became its main export during the fourteenth to fifteenth century, while wine from Gascony and Bordeaux, was the principal import. In addition the town conducted an extensive trade with the Anglo-Irish ports of southern Ireland, such as Waterford and Cork, as well as with Portugal. From about 1420–1480 the port also traded with Iceland, from which it imported a type of freeze-dried cod called &#x27;stockfish&#x27;.

In 1147 Bristol men and ships had assisted in the siege of Lisbon, which led to that city&#x27;s recapture from the Moors. A stone bridge was built across the Avon, c. 1247 and between the years of 1240 and 1247 a &quot;Great Ditch&quot; was constructed in St Augustine&#x27;s Marsh to straighten out the course of the River Frome and provide more space for berthing ships.

Redcliffe and Bedminster were incorporated into the city in 1373. Edward III proclaimed &quot;that the town of Bristol with its suburbs and precincts shall henceforth be separate from the counties of Gloucester and Somerset and be in all things exempt both by land by sea, and that it should be a county by itself, to be called the county of Bristol in perpetuity.&quot; This meant that disputes could be settled in courts in Bristol rather than at Gloucester, or at Ilminster for areas south of the Avon which had been part of Somerset. The city walls extended into Redcliffe and across the eastern part of the march which now became the &quot;Town Marsh&quot;. The major surviving part of the walls is visible adjacent to the only remaining gateway under the tower of the Church of St John the Baptist.

By the mid-14th century Bristol is considered to have been England&#x27;s third-largest town (after London and York), with an estimated 15–20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the Black Death of 1348–49. The plague inflicted a prolonged demographic setback, with the population estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000 during the 15th and 16th centuries.

One of the first great merchants of Bristol was William Canynge. Born c. 1399, he was five times mayor of the town and twice represented it as an MP. He is said to have owned ten ships and employed over 800 sailors. In later life he became a priest and spent a considerable part of his fortune in rebuilding St Mary Redcliffe church, which had been severely damaged by lightning in 1446.

The end of the Hundred Years War in 1453 meant that Britain, and thus Bristol, lost its access to Gascon wines and so imports of Spanish and Portuguese wines increased. Imports from Ireland included fish, hides and cloth (probably linen). Exports to Ireland included broadcloth, foodstuffs, clothing and metals.

It has been suggested that the decline of Bristol&#x27;s Iceland trade for &#x27;stockfish&#x27; (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol&#x27;s overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol&#x27;s customs accounts show that the port&#x27;s trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due to the increase of trade with Spain.

===Exploration===
In 1497 Bristol was the starting point for John Cabot&#x27;s voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol&#x27;s merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England&#x27;s fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow &#x27;pushed out&#x27; of Iceland.

In 1481 two local men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships looking for the mythical island of &quot;Hy-Brasil&quot;. There was no mention of the island being discovered but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form the basis for a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.

John Cabot was sponsored by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, looking for a new route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land. In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests that he might have.

From 1499 to 1508 a number of other expeditions were launched from Bristol to the &#x27;New found land&#x27;, the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot&#x27;s son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was &#x27;almost in the latitude of Gibraltar&#x27; and &#x27;almost the longitude of Cuba&#x27;. This would suggest that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.

==Early modern==
===Tudor and Stuart periods===
Bristol was made a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine becoming Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol&#x27;s friaries and monastic hospitals, together with St James&#x27; Priory, St Mary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In the case of the friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners had not been able to point to as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any objections to the royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol&#x27;s civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to St Mark&#x27;s Hospital, St Mary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total of a thousand pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at St Mark&#x27;s.

Bristol Grammar School was established in 1532 by the Thorne family and in 1596 John Carr established Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, a bluecoat school charged with &#x27;the education of poor children and orphans&#x27;.

Trade continued to grow: by the mid-16th century imports from Europe included, wine, olive oil, iron, figs and other dried fruits and dyes; exports included cloth (both cotton and wool), lead and hides. Many of the city&#x27;s leading merchants were involved in smuggling at this time, illicitly exporting goods like foodstuffs and leather, while under-declaring imports of wine.

In 1574 Elizabeth I visited the city during her &quot;Royal Progress&quot; through the western counties. The city burgesses spent over one thousand pounds on preparations and entertainments, most of which was raised by special rate assessments. In 1577 the explorer Martin Frobisher arrived in the city with two ships and samples of ore, which proved to be worthless. He also brought, according to Latimer &quot;three &quot;savages&quot;, doubtless &quot;Esqiumaux&quot;, clothed in deerskins, but all of them died within a month of their arrival.&quot;

Bristol sent three ships to the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also supplied two levies of men to the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities had no control over royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.

Anne of Denmark came to Bristol in June 1613 and was welcomed by the mayor Abel Kitchin. The visit featured a pageant on the river, with an English ship attacked by Turkish galleys, which the queen watched from the Canon&#x27;s Marsh meadow near the Cathedral. An English victory was signalled by the release of six bladders of pig&#x27;s blood poured out of the ship&#x27;s scupper holes.

===English Civil War===
In 1630 the city corporation bought the castle and when the First English Civil War broke out in 1642, the city took the Parliamentary side and partly restored the fortifications. However Royalist troops under the command of Prince Rupert captured Bristol on 26 July 1643, in the process causing extensive damage to both town and castle. The Royalist forces captured large amounts of booty and also eight armed merchant vessels which became the nucleus of the Royalist fleet. Workshops in the city became arms factories, providing muskets for the Royalist army.

In the summer of 1645, Royalist forces were defeated by the New Model Army at the Battle of Langport, in Somerset. Following further victories at Bridgwater and Sherborne, Sir Thomas Fairfax marched on Bristol. Prince Rupert returned to organise the defence of the city. The Parliamentary forces besieged the city and after three weeks attacked, eventually forcing Rupert to surrender on 10 September. The First Civil War ended the following year. There were no further military actions in Bristol during the second and third civil wars. In 1656, Oliver Cromwell ordered the destruction of the castle.

===Slave trade===

William de la Founte, a wealthy Bristol merchant has been identified as the first recorded English slave traders. Of Gascon origin, in 1480 he was one of the four venturers granted a licence &quot;to trade in any parts&quot;.
Renewed growth came with the 17th-century rise of England&#x27;s American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of Bristol&#x27;s part in the &quot;Triangular trade&quot; in Africans taken for slavery in the Americas. Over 2000 slaving voyages were made by Bristol ships between the late 17th century and abolition in 1807, carrying an estimated half a million people from Africa to the Americas in brutal conditions. Average profits per voyage were seventy per cent and more than fifteen per cent of the Africans transported died or were murdered on the Middle Passage. Some slaves were brought to Bristol, from the Caribbean; notable among these were Scipio Africanus, buried at Henbury and Pero Jones brought to Bristol by slave trader and plantation owner John Pinney.

The slave trade and the consequent demand for cheap brass ware for export to Africa caused a boom in the copper and brass manufacturing industries of the Avon valley, which in turn encouraged the progress of the Industrial Revolution in the area. Prominent manufacturers such as Abraham Darby and William Champion developed extensive works between Conham and Keynsham which used ores from the Mendips and coal from the North Somerset coalfield. Water power from tributaries of the Avon drove the hammers in the brass batteries, until the development of steam power in the later 18th century. Glass, soap, sugar, paper and chemical industries also developed along the Avon valley.

Edmund Burke was elected as Whig Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1774 and campaigned for free trade, Catholic emancipation and the rights of the American colonists, but he angered his merchant sponsors with his detestation of the slave trade and lost the seat in 1780.

Anti-slavery campaigners, inspired by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started some of the earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to be the beginning of movements for reform and women&#x27;s emancipation.

==18th and 19th centuries==

The Bristol Corporation of the Poor was established at the end of the 17th century and a workhouse, to provide work for the poor and shelter for those needing charity, was established, adjacent to the Bridewell. John Wesley founded the very first Methodist Chapel, The New Room in Broadmead in 1739, which is still in use in the 21st century. Wesley had come to Bristol at the invitation of George Whitfield. He preached in the open air to miners and brickworkers in Kingswood and Hanham.
Kingswood is the site of a recent archaeological excavation (2014) which uncovered the diversity of artisans living in the area at the time.

Bristol Bridge, the only way of crossing the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. 11 people were killed and 45 injured, making it one of the most deadly riots of the 18th century.

Competition from Liverpool from 1760, the disruption of maritime commerce through war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city&#x27;s failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the North and Midlands. The cotton industry failed to develop in the city; sugar, brass and glass production went into decline. Abraham Darby left Bristol for Coalbrookdale when his advanced ideas for iron production received no backing from local investors. Buchanan and Cossons cite &quot;a certain complacency and inertia [from the prominent mercantile families] which was a serious handicap in the adjustment to new conditions in the Industrial Revolution period.&quot;

The long passage up the heavily tidal Avon Gorge, which had made the port highly secure during the Middle Ages, had become a liability which the construction of a new &quot;Floating Harbour&quot; (designed by William Jessop) in 1804–1809 failed to overcome. Nevertheless, Bristol&#x27;s population (61,000 in 1801) grew fivefold during the 19th century, supported by growing commerce. It was particularly associated with the leading engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London, two pioneering Bristol-built steamships, the SS Great Western and the SS Great Britain, and the Clifton Suspension Bridge.
The new middle class, led by those who agitated against the slave trade, in the city began to engage in charitable works. Notable were Mary Carpenter, who founded ragged schools and reformatories, and George Müller who founded an orphanage in 1836. Badminton School was started in Badminton House, Clifton in 1858 and Clifton College was established in 1862. University College, the predecessor of the University of Bristol, was founded in 1876 and the former Merchant Venturers Navigation School became the Merchant Venturers College in 1894. This later formed the nucleus of Bristol Polytechnic, which in turn became the University of the West of England.

The Bristol Riots of 1831 took place after the House of Lords rejected the second Reform Bill. Local magistrate Sir Charles Wetherall, a strong opponent of the Bill, visited Bristol to open the new Assize Courts and an angry mob chased him to the Mansion House in Queen Square. The Reform Act was passed in 1832 and the city boundaries were expanded for the first time since 1373 to include &quot;Clifton, the parishes of St. James, St. Paul, St. Philip, and parts of the parishes of Bedminster and Westbury&quot;. The parliamentary constituencies in the city were revised in 1885 when the original Bristol (UK Parliament constituency) was split into four.

Bristol lies on one of the UK&#x27;s lesser coalfields, and from the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Though these prompted the construction of the Somerset Coal Canal, and the formation of the Bristol Miners&#x27; Association, it was difficult to make mining profitable, and the mines closed after nationalisation.

At the end of the 19th century the main industries were tobacco and cigarette manufacture, led by the dominant W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills company, paper and engineering. The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.

==Modern history==
The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, which later became the Bristol Aeroplane Company, then part of the British Aircraft Corporation and finally BAE Systems, was founded by Sir George White, owner of Bristol Tramways in 1910. During World War I production of the Bristol Scout and the Bristol F.2 Fighter established the reputation of the company. The main base at Filton is still a prominent manufacturing site for BAE Systems in the 21st century. The Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s engine department became a subsidiary company Bristol Aero Engines, then Bristol Siddeley Engines; and were bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966, to become Rolls-Royce plc which is still based at Filton. Shipbuilding in the city docks, predominately by Charles Hill &amp; Sons, formerly Hilhouse, remained important until the 1970s. Other prominent industries included chocolate manufacturers J. S. Fry &amp; Sons and wine and sherry importers John Harvey &amp; Sons.

Bristol City F.C. (formed in 1897) joined the Football League in 1901 and became runners up in the First Division in 1906 and losing FA Cup finalists in 1909. Rivals Bristol Rovers F.C. (formed in 1883) joined the league in 1920. Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formed in 1870 and have been runners up in the County Championship many times since.

Bristol City Council built over 15,000 houses between 1919 and 1939, enabling clearance of some of the worst slums in the city centre. The new estates were at Southmead, Knowle, Filwood Park, Sea Mills and Horfield. The city boundaries were extended to north and south to accommodate this growth. In 1926, the Portway, a new road along the Avon Gorge built at a cost of around £800,000, was opened linking the floating harbour to the expanding docks at Avonmouth.

As the location of aircraft manufacture and a major port, Bristol was a target of bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol&#x27;s city centre also suffered severe damage, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is still a park featuring two bombed out churches and some fragments of the castle. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre and Cabot Circus were built over bomb-damaged areas.

As with other British cities, there was immigration from various Commonwealth countries in the post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul&#x27;s sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city&#x27;s ethnic minorities.

Bristol aviation continued to develop in post war years. The Bristol Brabazon was a large trans-Atlantic airliner built in the late 1940s, based on developments in heavy bombers during the World War, but it received no sales orders and never went into production. Concorde, the first supersonic airliner was built in the 1960s, first flying in 1969. The aircraft never achieved commercial success, but its development did lay the foundation for the successful Airbus series of airliners, parts of which are produced at Filton in the 21st century.

In the 1980s the financial services sector became a major employer in the city and surrounding areas, such as the business parks on the northern fringe of what was now referred to as &quot;Greater Bristol&quot; or the &quot;Bristol Urban Area&quot; comprising the city, Easton-in-Gordano, Frampton Cottrell and Winterbourne, Kingswood, Mangotsfield and Stoke Gifford. High technology companies such as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and Orange, along with creative and media enterprises become significant local employers as traditional manufacturing industries declined.

Like much of British post-war planning, regeneration of Bristol city centre was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture and expansion of roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 one of the city centre&#x27;s tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes.

The removal of the docks to Avonmouth, seven miles (11 km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the central zone of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour) in the late 20th century. The deep-water Royal Portbury Dock was developed opposite Avonmouth Docks in the 1970s and following privatisation of the Port of Bristol has become financially successful.

At one time the continued existence of the old central docks was in jeopardy as it was seen merely as derelict industry rather than an asset to be developed for public use. Since the 1980s millions of pounds have been spent regenerating the harbourside. 1999 saw the redevelopment of the city centre and the construction of Pero&#x27;s footbridge; which now links the At-Bristol science centre at Canon&#x27;s Marsh, opened in 2000, with other Bristol tourist attractions. Private investors are also constructing studio apartment buildings. The regeneration of the Canon&#x27;s Marsh area is expected to cost £240 million. Crest Nicholson were the lead developers constructing 450 new flats, homes and waterside offices, under the guidance of The Harbourside Sponsors&#x27; Group which is a partnership between the City Council, developers, businesses, and public funders.

<doc id="1139282" wikidata="Q446551" url="?curid=1139282" title="Buick Gran Sport">
<text>The Gran Sport name has been used on several high-performance cars built by General Motors for its Buick brand since 1965. In the GM brands hierarchy, Buick was surpassed in luxury and comfort appointments only by Cadillac, which did not produce performance models. As a result, the Buick GS series were the most opulently equipped GM sport models of their era.

The Gran Sport performance enhancements on all Buick products during this era sought to affirm Buick&#x27;s tradition of producing powerful and comfortable products going back to the 1930s when all Buicks of the time were upgraded to the Buick Fireball Straight Eight, then installed the Roadmaster engine in the shortest model Special and introduced the Century, known as &quot;the banker&#x27;s hot rod&quot; with a three speed synchromesh manual transmission. The Gran Sport sought to identify cars that were fun to drive with a luxury approach.

==Skylark based Gran Sports==

The 1965 Skylark Gran Sport was the intermediate Buick Skylark with the Gran Sport option added. Although a V8 was already offered in the Skylark, the Gran Sport had the largest engine permitted by GM - a Buick V8 (called a 400 by Buick because that was the maximum engine size allowed in intermediate body cars). This engine produced 325 hp (242 kW) and 445 lb·ft (603 Nm) and was known as the &quot;nailhead&quot; engine. Buick sold more than 15,000 Skylarks with the Gran Sport option that first year, and almost as many the next. It was renamed the GS 400 in 1967, and the Gran Sport became its own model in (about) that same year along with a new &quot;400&quot; engine quite different from the famously reliable but becoming-obsolete nailhead engine design that was first introduced in 1953. Sales fell somewhat in the face of increasingly higher-performance and more popular muscle cars from other marques, including corporate stablemates Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Chevelle SS and Oldsmobile 442, when compared to those from the more conservative and luxurious Buick. Buick, however, stepped it up a notch when introducing the Stage 1 option in 1969. This limited production (less than 1,500 cars in 1969) version delivered 340 hp (253 kW) and 440 lb·ft (597 Nm).

The name Gran Sport replaced the GS moniker with the 1973 Gran Sport, and was again revived in the late eighties on the FWD Skylark model with various performance options added.

===GS California===

Buick touted the California as &quot;The Distinctive Personal Car for Americana on the GO&quot;, using the Skylark platform. The merchandising creation of the West Coast&#x27;s Mickey Garrett, the California GS became one of Buick&#x27;s entries into what is now often known as a junior musclecar. The intent of these autos were to provide the visual impact of the era&#x27;s supercars with the low maintenance and price of a more economical car, while maintaining reasonable performance levels. When reviewed with these thoughts in mind the California GS delivered quite nicely. They were fitted with the small block GS drivetrain and the exterior received the full treatment including vinyl top, chrome moulding package, GS emblems, and special California scripts. This marketing approach was also used in Colorado, using the &quot;Colorado&quot; name instead of &quot;California&quot;.

1967 was the maiden year for the California GS. It was available in California only and was not advertised nationally by Buick. Built on the thin-pillar coupe chassis it came equipped with the 340 ci/260 hp engine and Super Turbine 300 transmission. Bench seats were standard and accessories were kept to a minimum to help keep the price down. Car Life tested one in their June issue and ran the 1/4 in 16.7 seconds at 81 mph, they also recorded a top speed of 105 mph. The article contains a lengthy description of the car and how it performed during testing, it is a must read for anyone interested in learning more about the &#x27;67 California GS.

Mid year 1968 saw the official introduction of the California GS, and it is frequently known as a &#x27;69 model. Buick asked &quot;Why settle for less when the California GS, built especially for YOU, costs no more?&quot; Exclusively designed for Golden State motorists, Buick advertised the car nationally as a high performance family sports car at an economy car price. Though the car was not included in Buick&#x27;s yearly catalog it was shown in a two-page black and white fold out brochure. Custom California GS emblems again graced the rear fenders while GS ornamentation could be found in the grille and sail panels. The drivetrain included Buick&#x27;s new for &#x27;68 350-4 V8 with 10.25:1 compression and Rochester (GM) 4GC Quadrajet four-barrel (four-choke) carburetor, producing 280 hp and 375 lb·ft of torque. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 transmission (driving a 3.23:1 rear axle gear, designed for highway cruising) and bench seat interior were again the only choices. Buick also added chrome plated wheels and air cleaner lid to the two-door thin pillar coupe. Tires were on rims.

1969 was the last year of production for the California GS. The car was for the first time featured in Buick&#x27;s big brochure. A two-page color picture of the thin pillar coupe and pictures of the again standard bench seat interior were included along with equipment descriptions. Tom McCahill tested the car and recorded a 0–60 mph time of 9.5 seconds and a top speed of 110 mph. Again the car came with Buick&#x27;s 280 hp 350-4 engine but now it was mated to the new Turbo 350 transmission. Custom California emblems again graced the rear fenders, and the rear marker lights were plain red without Buick&#x27;s normal 350 or 400 script. Vinyl tops, as with previous years, were standard fare with the California&#x27;s distinctive GS logo on the sail panel.

===Gran Sport 340/350===
In 1967 Buick added a version, there was the GS 340 and the GS California sub-model, little more than the Skylark hardtop with new badging and trim, The 340 produced and 365 lb·ft (495 Nm), and less than 4,000 cars were sold. It was replaced the next year with the GS 350 and similar GS California; these used Buick&#x27;s &quot;350&quot; small-block V8 engine. A California 2-door coupe appeared in 1969; total GS sales for the year, not counting the new California coupe, were 12,465 (4,933 GS 350s, 7,532 GS 400s). Sales of the GS 350 for 1970 climbed to 9,948; in addition, 10,148 2-doors were built. The Gran Sport 350 outlived its big brothers, lasting until V8 Gran Sport production stopped in 1975, replaced by the Gran Sport 231.

===Gran Sport 400===
In 1968 and 1969 Buick offered the GS 400 in a convertible and hardtop model. Standard issue of the GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6 L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350 hp stage 1 ) and 440 ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually &quot;low&quot; 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard three-speed or optional four-speed manual gearbox was also available. Compression ratio on this engine was a moderately high 10.25:1, which allowed for the use of any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was generally fake, although it could be functional if ordered with the very rare ram air package. 1969 brought ram air as standard to the GS.

Like all of the GM versions of this body style in this period, the convertible chassis was considerably more robust than the hardtop version. In fact, the convertible chassis was a full box frame chassis that had numerous lightening holes. The hardtop chassis was a 3/4 box frame with no lightening holes. The only GM hardtop ever built with the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; convertible chassis was the GTO Judge. Same chassis. All of the GS400 convertibles were built at GM&#x27;s Fremont, California assembly line.

===Gran Sport 455===

The 400 was replaced for 1970 with the Buick V8 engine, used in the GS 455. The base model was rated at and at 2800 rpm of torque. In the optional Stage 1 trim equipped with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor was rated at SAE gross at 4600 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their &quot;as installed&quot; condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place). The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET at 105.5 mph from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale&#x27;s Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual &quot;as installed&quot; peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period).

Dennis Manner, Buick Engine development engineer still recalls the production-line pulled engine dyno test results from 1970 where the lowest HP output of the 15 tested 455 Stage 1 engines was 376 hp.

The December 2004 issue of &quot;Musclecar Enthusiast&quot; magazine conducted an engine dynamometer test of a freshly rebuilt and well documented 1970 455 Stage 1 (bored .040&quot; over to 464 cubic inches and minus the power-robbing factory engine fan, air cleaner assembly and mufflers). In that condition and with factory timing and carburetor tuning, the engine produced a maximum of 360.9 Gross Horsepower. Optimal carburetor and ignition tuning yielded a peak Gross HP reading of 381.7 HP - again with no engine fan, air cleaner or mufflers in place. While urban legend would have us believe that these engines made &quot;420 HP from the factory,&quot; actual empirical results prove otherwise. Although another dynamometer test on a 1970 Skylark GS Stage I showed 471 SAE gross hp, which is more consistent with the engine producing about 360 SAE net hp. 

The Stage 1 engine option used cylinder heads that, while using raw castings of the same pattern as all of the other Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13&quot; intake and 1.755&quot; exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio. The option also included a more aggressive camshaft, a specially tuned 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor, more aggressive ignition timing,5/8 inch oil pickup tube and a higher numerical final drive, and was available with either Turbo Hydra-matic 400 3-speed automatic transmission, or a Muncie M-22 4-speed manual transmission (although it was later discovered, and confirmed, that one 1970 GS Stage 1 convertible was produced with a 3-speed manual and a standard 3.64:1 Positraction axle ratio). Stage 1 cars equipped with air conditioning received a 3.42 axle ratio.

While powerful in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin walls in the lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads, stunningly high torque and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.

The upgraded engine option to the 1970 GS 455, the moderately priced Stage 1 package, drew a great amount of attention and controversy in the muscle-car world when in the 1980s it was listed as faster than any of the Chrysler Hemi cars in the original &quot;50 fastest muscle cars&quot; list. This Hemi &quot;vs&quot;. Stage 1 controversy has prompted several contests to settle the issue; it remains an unsettled matter and has been a great boon to car magazine sales over the years.

There was also a rare “Stage 2” option produced. This was a dealer-installed package (known as a &quot;dealer option&quot;), first offered in 1969. It included a cam, headers, intake manifold, high compression forged pistons, hollow pushrods, and some calibration changes to the ignition and carburetor. In 1970 the Stage 2 package was designed for the 455 and included special round exhaust port Stage 2 heads, matching Kustom brand headers, a radical cam, high compression forged pistons, Edelbrock B4B aluminum intake, Holley carburetor #4781 850 cfm, and other equipment for racing. Few Stage 2s even exist and Buick only ever factory assembled 1 Stage 2 test unit, it was a factory GSX clone test mule with 4-speed manual transmission used for speed testing. That GSX test mule was equipped with 4.78 gearing and was driven on the streets and tracks on the West Coast. The Stage 2 package&#x27;s existence was not made public until 1972 when the Stage 2 parts could be ordered in any combination. There is little documentation about any Stage 2 cars that were sold. Three are known to exist and all three of these cars were built as Stage 1 cars at the factory. One was owned by Kenne-Bell a factory backed Buick high performance specialist based in California, sponsored by Reynolds Buick. This car was used as a test car in the development of the Stage 2 components in conjunction with Buick engineering. The second Stage 2 was known as the Jones-Benisek car. The Jones/Benisek car is known to have been delivered as a Stage 1 car. The Stage 2 hood and scoop was added later. The Stage 2 iron heads were purchased by the owner at a local Buick Dealer. The car had a very successful drag racing career with many wins and some world records also. The third Stage 2 is known as Wiley Coyote and as the Turner car. It was originally owned by Bob Thetford and campaigned as &quot;Wiley Coyote&quot; in the NHRA. Sponsored by Kenne-Bell and Dunn Buick in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Later it was owned by Jim Turner and was very successful in NMCA winning 5 National Records.

Output and sales for the assembly-line cars were down after 1970 largely due to reduced engine compression ratios and a change from gross to net horsepower ratings. In later years, air quality regulations further limited the power in part due to the addition of catalytic converters and single exhaust pipes. However, Stage 2 parts were available over the Buick parts counter although the Stage 2 heads were discontinued after about 75 sets were produced. The discontinuation was due to porosity problems with castings. The discontinuation of the Stage 2 also was due to the ever-tightening emission standards which resulted in lower performance.

===GSX===

GSX / GSX Stage 1 was Buick&#x27;s contribution to the Classic era American Muscle car list, based on the GS455 which was in turn based on the Skylark platform adding an appearance, performance and handling package available starting in the 1970 model year. The GSX Performance and Handling package was a $1,100 option on the GS455 ($ in dollars ) in addition to the listed retail price of $3,098 ($ in dollars ) for the Buick Gran Sport which the GSX was based. The GSX was Buick&#x27;s attempt to increase showroom traffic on a newly designed Skylark body style for 1970 which started off slow but sales improved. The GSX was Buick&#x27;s answer to Pontiac&#x27;s GTO Judge, Oldsmobile&#x27;s 4-4-2 W-30, and Chevrolet&#x27;s Chevelle SS. Buick advertised it as &quot;A Brand New Brand Of Buick&quot; and &quot;Another &#x27;Light Your Fire&#x27; Car From Buick&quot;. It came standard with a 455ci engine with or without the optional Stage 1 performance engine upgrades during the first year of release. Although near the top of GM&#x27;s brand hierarchy, the GSX hardtop&#x27;s basic bodyshell was the same as the lower-priced 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle but with differing guards, grille, bumpers, doors, etc., while Pontiac and Oldsmobile midsize hardtop coupes shared a slightly different body.

Due to the late introduction of the GSX, a very special prototype was displayed at the Chicago Motor Show in February 1970 to test consumer reaction. This particular GSX had Mother Of Pearl white paint, a special fiberglass/steel ram air hood with unique modified hood scoops, one-off 3 piece rear spoiler and a prototype front spoiler, custom multicolored leather interior featuring checkerboard black and white X patterned seats and door panels. It became a hit and production started with the factory GSX looking slightly different than the prototype GSX. The GSX did not appear in the standard model catalog for 1970, however a GSX pamphlet was made available to the public. A four-page, full size pamphlet announced the GSX with artist drawn pictures and specifications. Only 678 GSXs were produced in the second half of the 1970 model year beginning in March 1970. and ending in May 1970. Just 278 were equipped with the standard 455, a further 400 purchasers selected the optional Stage 1 performance package. The impressive performance is partly due to the light weight of the 455 which is roughly less than the Chrysler 426 Hemi or Chevrolet 454. At 510 lb-ft the Buick 455 produced the highest torque output of any American production performance car, a record held for 33 years until finally surpassed by the Series 2 V10 Viper in 2003. The 1970 Buick GSX has, without doubt, the most extensive list of standard equipment high performance features of any classic era muscle car. 
It is this last fact that truly sets the GSX in a class of its own when compared to its late &#x27;60s - early &#x27;70s peers. Every single 1970 GSX Stage 1 produced received the full list of performance and handling parts. You could buy a poorly optioned Chevelle SS, a leaf-sprung, bench seat Hemi Roadrunner or even a Pontiac GTO Judge with the smaller 400ci engine and drum brakes, but there is no such thing as an under-equipped 1970 GSX.

In 1970, the GSX option was available in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White and always with the 455ci stump-puller and black interior (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). All GSXs had the distinctive full body length black stripe that crossed over the standard equipment rear spoiler and was outlined in red pin stripes. A large area of the hood was also black with a hood mounted tachometer (Buick engineers disliked the hood tachometer because it was a Pontiac part) and black front spoiler. Also standard equipment were black bucket seats, floor shifter, wide oval tires, quick ratio steering and anti-sway bars front and rear and quad-link suspension attached to a limited-slip rear differential. Some other options were automatic transmission or four speed manual, A/C or Non-A/C. Restored matching numbers versions have sold in Barrett-Jackson&#x27;s and Mecum auctions for as much as $200,000.

During 1971 and 1972, the GSX package became an option that was available on any Gran Sport. Production dropped in 1971 to only 124, and again to 44 in 1972. These numbers include the available 350-4 bbl option, the standard 455, and the Stage 1 engines.
Many GSXs survive to this day and can be seen at the Buick Gran Sport Nationals held annually in Bowling Green, KY in the middle of May (for the past number of years this time had been changed to September because of weather concerns) along with many other examples of &#x27;60s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s Buick performance models. Another Buick event is the Buick Performance Group Nationals which is held at National Trail Raceway in Columbus, Ohio early during the month of August each year.

==Other Gran Sports==
===Riviera GS===
The Riviera Gran Sport was a high-performance luxury version of the Buick Riviera, produced from 1965 through 1975.

In 1965, it was called Riviera Gran Sport and the later models were still officially called Gran Sport but showed GS badges instead of Gran Sport.
Unlike the mid-size GS models, the Riviera and Wildcat GS package included a standard 3.42 positraction rear axle until 1973.
The 1965 (and optional in 1966) Riviera Gran Sport also came with a 425 cubic &quot;Super Wildcat&quot; engine, with dual carbs and dual snorkel chrome air cleaner. You could add H2 option (Ride and handling package) for even better road handling. Shorter gear ratio for steering, 1 inch lower suspension.
===Wildcat GS===

Another GS option package was available on the Buick Wildcat and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburetors, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nailhead engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.
===Century GS / Century GS Stage 1===
In 1973–75 and in 1986, there was a Century Gran Sport. For 1973, Buick renamed its intermediate line from Skylark to Century, a nameplate previously used on Buick&#x27;s full-sized performance cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958. Like all GM intermediates, the 1973 Century received new Colonnade styling, which amounted to pillared hardtop sedans, coupes and station wagons - each of which utilized frameless windows along with fixed rear side windows, and convertibles were discontinued. on third generation Buick Century the GS name badge became the &quot;Gran Sport&quot; and was now an option package on the semi-fastback Century Colonnade coupes. The &quot;Gran Sport&quot; option included decals on the rear fenders and trunk lid reading &quot;gran sport&quot; along with suspension and appearance upgrades.

The standard engine was a 150-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8, which was the standard engine for all Centurys. In addition to the 175-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with single exhaust), the 190-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with dual exhaust) was available only on the Gran Sport. Two 455 cubic-inch V8s were available including the 250-horsepower four-barrel and the Stage 1 four-barrel rated at 270 horsepower (both with dual exhaust) - all net figures and similar to the 1972 models. In 1973 only 979 Century Gran sport 455 and 728 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled, For 350 engines there was 3 transmissions available, 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra-matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines only M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission.

The 1974 Century &quot;gran sport&quot; received exterior and interior trim changes. The same selection of engines was carried over from 1973 including the 350 four-barrel, 455 four-barrel and the 455 Stage 1 four-barrel (the 455s downrated to 245 and 255 net horsepower respectively). In this Year 455 stage 1 was one of first GM cars that receive High energy ignition distributor. Like 1973 model year for 350 engines there was 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra-matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. Radial tires were a new option for 1974 along with reclining Strato bucket seats. In 1974 only 579 Century Gran sport 455 and 478 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled.

For 1975, the Century GS, or &quot;gran sport&quot; entered its third and final year on the Colonnade body. It was reduced to a mere appearance/handling package as the 455/Stage 1 options were discontinued and Buick&#x27;s revived 231 cubic-inch V6 was the standard engine, mated to a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional Turbo Hydra-matic. The only optional engines were two 350 V8s, a two-barrel 155 horsepower version or the four-barrel option rated at 175 horsepower and offered only with the Turbo Hydra-matic. Both engines were also mated to catalytic converters for the first time this year, which mandated the use of unleaded gasoline and precluded the availability of true dual exhaust systems. Radial tires were now standard equipment and the Strato bucket seat option reverted to the non-reclining version.

Production Figures:
Both the Century GS and the larger Riviera GS (which also had been continually produced since 1965) were discontinued after the 1975 model year due to sagging sales for high-performance cars following the 1973–74 energy crisis and subsequent trends toward smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. Performance versions of the Century (and its companion Regal line) and Riviera would return in the late 1970s with the advent of Buick&#x27;s turbocharged 231 V6 introduced in 1978 on the Century/Regal intermediates and the full-sized LeSabre Sport Coupe and then the newly introduced front drive Riviera in 1979 for the &quot;S-Type&quot; which later became the T-Type, a moniker that would ultimately replace the GS badge for sporty/performance Buicks in the early 1980s.

The Century GS model returned in 1986 for what was now Buick&#x27;s front-drive intermediate-sized car (Regal continued as a coupe on the 1978-vintage rear-drive G-body until 1987). The GS was only offered as a two-door coupe and was powered by a fuel-injected 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 mated to a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission but with far less horsepower than the rear-drive Regal GN&#x27;s turbocharged/intercooled version rated at 245 horsepower. This Century GS was a one-year-only offering in 1986 sold alongside the Century T-Type coupe and sedan.

===Apollo GSX===
In 1974, the GSX consisted of a trim package on Buick&#x27;s small, X-bodied Apollo. Three engines were available on the 1974 GSX: the Chevrolet supplied 250 6-cyl.,and two Buick engines:the 350 2 barrel and 350 4 barrel versions.

===Regal GS / Regal GSX===
From 1988 to 2004 and 2010 to present There is Buick Regal GS and Gran Sport models. For third Generations Buick Regal there was a Gran Sport version model. The Gran Sport option generally contained the following items:
* Leather bucket seats and center console
* Black, wide, body side moldings (coupe only)
* Gran Touring (FE3) suspension - which included faster power steering, and revised springs and struts
* Front air dam and aero rocker panels (coupe only)
* 16 inch aluminum wheels
* Fog lamps
* Two tone paint (sedan only)
* Leather steering wheel

Beginning in late 1990, the 3.8L (231 cu in) Series I V6 producing was available. For 1996, this was updated to the Series II V6 with . The 1997–2004 body style featured a 3.8L Series II supercharged V6.

For 4th Generation Buick Regal The 3.8 liter V6 supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to 60 mph (97 km/h) took 6.7 seconds. The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced and of torque. The Regal GS&#x27;s PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.
In the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick, in collaboration with SLP Performance, came out with the Buick Regal GSX. They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. For the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5 inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at 270 horsepower and 312 pound-feet of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn&#x27;t officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.

For the 5th generation Buick Regal, the GS version of the Regal was based on the Opel Insignia OPC and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. This front-wheel drive sedan GS features Buick&#x27;s Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with Brembo front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19 inch wheels will be standard and 20 inch forged aluminum wheels will be available. The GS is expected to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds. It is equipped with GS-only high-output version of the Ecotec 2.0L turbo engine with and of torque. The GM LHU engine used in the GS trim makes 135 hp per liter.

For the 6th generation Regal, from 2018 Buick released an updated version of the Regal GS. The new Regal is equipped with a GM LGX V6 3.6 producing 310 horsepower paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission yielding acceleration from zero to 60 mph in under six seconds.

<doc id="1139288" wikidata="Q5535863" url="?curid=1139288" title="George's Dock">
<text>George&#x27;s Dock was a dock, on the River Mersey, England, within the Port of Liverpool. It was 
connected to Canning Dock to the south and George&#x27;s Basin to the north.

==History==
Construction of the dock began in 1762, and was known as North Dock prior to completion. The dock, which opened in 1771, was designed and built by Henry Berry and named after the reigning monarch, King George III. The dock basin originally covered an area of slightly more than . The port built ships bound for West Africa, North America and the Caribbean delivering and returning with Black Slaves. Benefiting greatly from the endeavor with the population of Liverpool growing from seventeen thousand, to seventy seven thousand at the end of the 18th century.

The Goree Warehouses were built to the east of the dock in 1793, and were severely damaged during a fire in 1802. Which caused over £320,000 of damage. The dock was rebuilt and expanded between 1822–5, after losing its American and Caribbean shipping to Prince&#x27;s Dock, being expanded by John Foster, Sr. Following the rebuild and expansion, the dock was mainly used by schooners carrying perishable goods.

The adjoining George&#x27;s Basin was filled in 1874. In 1899-1900 the dock was filled in to create what is now the Pier Head, to provide one central place for Liverpool Docks&#x27; offices, which before were scattered across different sites. A section of the original George&#x27;s Dock wall is still visible in the basement of the Cunard Building which stands on the site. The Goree Warehouses, which had been named after a slave market in West Africa, were destroyed by bombing during World War II.

By March 2009, work was completed on a £22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal on the site of the former basin. The canal extension provides a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway.

<text>The George&#x27;s Basin was a dock on the River Mersey, England, within the Port of Liverpool. The basin surface covered and was surrounded by George&#x27;s Dock to the south, Prince&#x27;s Dock to the north and the Mersey to the west.

Used as a berth for commercial shipping and as a dry dock for vessel repairs, the mouth of the basin was sealable with floodgates.

The basin was filled in 1874. In 1899, the adjoining George&#x27;s Dock was filled in and the site was used to create what is now the Pier Head. This provided one central place for Liverpool Docks&#x27; offices, which had been scattered across different sites.

By March 2009 work was completed on a £22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal on the site of the former basin. The canal extension provides a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway.

<text>Charles Fearne (1742–1794) was an English jurist.

==Life==
The son of Charles Fearne, judge-advocate of the Admiralty, he was born in London, and was educated at Westminster School.

Fearne adopted the legal profession, but devoted time and money to experiments: he saw a commercial application to morocco leather, and designed a musket. He died in 1794, leaving his widow and family in impecunious circumstances.

==Works==
Fearne&#x27;s 1772 work, &quot;Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders and Executory Devices&quot;, is deemed to have done &quot;more than any other to preserve the Rule in Shelley&#x27;s Case as black letter law (as distinguished from a rule of construction).&quot; His &quot;Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders and Executory Devises&quot;, the work which has made his reputation as a legal authority, and which passed through numerous editions, was called forth by a decision of Lord Mansfield in the case of &quot;Perrin v. Blake&quot;, and had the effect of reversing that decision.

An edition in 1797 was by his former pupil John Joseph Powell, and the &quot;Essay on the Nature and Operation of Fines and Recoveries&quot; (1783) by William Cruise was inspired by &quot;Contingent Remainders&quot;.

A volume entitled &quot;Fearne&#x27;s Posthumous Works&quot; was published by subscription in 1797 for the benefit of his widow.

<text>Elizabeth Becker Henley (born May 8, 1952) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and actress. Her play &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the 1981 New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best American Play, and a nomination for a Tony Award. Her screenplay for &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Biography==
Henley was born in 1952 in Jackson, Mississippi. She was one of four sisters. Her parents were Charles B. Henley, an attorney, and Elizabeth Josephine Henley, an actress. Henley attended Murrah High School in Jackson, followed by Southern Methodist University, where she was a member of the acting ensemble. While at college, Henley completed her first play, a one-act piece entitled &quot;Am I Blue&quot;. She graduated from Southern Methodist in 1974 with a BFA. From 1975 to 1976, she taught playwriting at the University of Illinois (Urbana) and the Dallas Minority Repertory Theater.

In 1976 Henley moved to Los Angeles and began work on her play &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;.

For many years, Henley dated actor, writer and director Stephen Tobolowsky, whom she met while they were students at Southern Methodist University. Their relationship ended in 1988.

==Playwright and screenwriter==
&quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; was Henley&#x27;s first professionally produced play. It opened at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in 1978, where it was declared co-winner of a new American play contest. The play then moved to New York and was produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1981 as well as the award for Best American Play of 1981 from the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle. The play also earned Henley a nomination for a Tony Award, and her screenplay for the film version of &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; was nominated for an Oscar as Best Adapted Screenplay. Henley has stated that growing up with three sisters was a major inspiration for her play &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;.

Henley&#x27;s first six plays are set in the Deep South: two in Louisiana and four in Mississippi, where she grew up.

Henley adapted her 1984 play &quot;The Miss Firecracker Contest&quot; into a 1989 film starring Holly Hunter entitled &quot;Miss Firecracker&quot;. Henley&#x27;s play &quot;Ridiculous Fraud&quot; was produced at the McCarter Theatre, Princeton, New Jersey in 2006. Her play &quot;Family Week&quot; was produced at MCC Theater, New York City in 2010, directed by Jonathan Demme.

==Criticism==
The themes in her plays often consider the importance of love, the contrast between family love and romantic love, how family and society define and confine her female characters, and the alienation and suffering of the human condition. Characters in her plays may seek happiness but are betrayed by modern civilization. Henley&#x27;s work suggests the influence of Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theory. Her Southern sense of the grotesque and absurd experienced in daily existence have caused her to be compared to other Southern writers such as Eudora Welty and Flannery O&#x27;Connor, or to be considered part of the Southern Gothic tradition.

Her plays written in the 1980s have been characterized as naturalistic portrayals of the relationship between the inner self and the world, and her characters often are outsiders and nonconformists unable to share their feelings and experiences. Her plays of the 1990s, including &quot;Abundance&quot;, the first play not set in the South, are considered more experimental than her earlier work. Henley applies new techniques and styles in these plays. Her play &quot;Revelers&quot; employs some older and traditional theatre techniques.

<doc id="1139297" wikidata="Q5775447" url="?curid=1139297" title="History of Buckinghamshire">
<text>Although the name [[Buckinghamshire]] is Anglo Saxon in origin meaning &quot;The district (scire) of Bucca&#x27;s home&quot; (referring to Buckingham in the north of the county) the name has only been recorded since about the 12th century. The historic county itself has been in existence since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of Wessex in the 10th century. It was formed out of about 200 communities that could between them fund a castle in Buckingham, to defend against invading Danes.

==Human settlement in pre-history==

Some of the places in Buckinghamshire date back much further than the Anglo-Saxon period. Aylesbury, for example, is known from archaeological digs to date back at least as far as 1500 and the Icknield Way, which crosses the county, is pre-Roman in origin. There are a wealth of places that still have their Brythonic names (Penn, Wendover), or a compound of Brythonic and Anglo Saxon (Brill, Chetwode, Great Brickhill) and there are pre-Roman earthworks all over the county. Also, Cunobelinus, a legendary king of the Catuvellauni (an ancient British tribe) is said to have had a stronghold in the area (and to have inspired the name of a group of villages known as the Kimbles).

Settlement began in the area that was to become Milton Keynes around 2000 BCE, mainly in the valleys of the rivers Ouse and Ouzel and their tributaries (Bradwell Brook, Shenley Brook). Archaeological excavations discovered several burial sites dating from 2000 BCE to 1500 BCE. Evidence for the earliest habitation was found at Blue Bridge — production of flint tools from the Middle Stone Age. In the same area, an unusually large (18 metre diameter) round house was excavated and dated to the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age, about 700BCE. Other excavations in this Blue Bridge/Bancroft hill-side uncovered a further seven substantial settlement sites, dating from then until 100 BCE.

==Roman Britain==
The Roman influence on Buckinghamshire is most widely felt in the Roman roads that cross the county. Watling Street and Akeman Street both cross the county from east to west though there is circumspection that these are based on older roads. The Romans also made use of the much older Icknield Way. The first two were important trade routes linking London with other parts of Roman Britain, and the latter was used by the Romans as a line of defence.

==Anglo-Saxons==
The single group of people who probably had the greatest influence on Buckinghamshire&#x27;s history, however, are the Anglo-Saxons. Not only did they give most of the places within the county their names, but the modern layout of the county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. One of the great battles worthy of mention in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; was fought between Cerdic of Wessex, his son Cynric and the Britons at Chearsley, which is named after Cerdic himself. Also no fewer than three saints from this period were born in Quarrendon (Saint Osyth, Saint Edburga and Saint Edith) and in the late Anglo-Saxon period a royal palace was established at Brill. The sheer wealth in the county was worthy of note when the Domesday Survey was taken in 1086.

==Norman conquest==
William the Conqueror annexed most of the manors for himself and his family: Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, William&#x27;s half brother, became a major landowner locally. Many ancient hunts became the king&#x27;s property (worthy of note are Bernwood Forest, Whaddon Chase and Princes Risborough) as did all the wild swans of England. The ancient tradition of breeding swans in Buckinghamshire for the king&#x27;s pleasure much later provided the inspiration for the heraldic supporter for Buckinghamshire County Council&#x27;s coat of arms. The Plantagenets continued to take advantage of the wealth of the county.

==Henry VIII: Buckingham gives way to Aylesbury==
Another flush of annexations of local manors to the Crown accompanied the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536), when almost a third of the county became the personal property of King Henry VIII. Henry VIII was also responsible for making Aylesbury the official county town over Buckingham, which he is alleged to have done in order to curry favour with Thomas Boleyn so that he could marry his daughter Anne. Another of Henry&#x27;s wives, Catherine Parr, also had a sphere of influence within the county at Beachampton.

==English Civil War==
In the English Civil War (1642–1649) Buckinghamshire was mostly Parliamentarian, although some pockets of Royalism did exist. The Parliamentarian John Hampden was from Buckinghamshire, known particularly for his significant and successful battle tactics at Aylesbury in 1642. Some villages to the west of the county (Brill and Boarstall for example) were under constant conflict for the duration of the war, given their equidistance between Parliamentarian Aylesbury and Royalist Oxford. Many of these places were effectively wiped off the map in the conflict, but were later rebuilt. In the north of the county, Stony Stratford was Royalist and Newport Pagnell was Parliamentarian: the line of control between the sides echoed the Danegeld 700 years earlier.

==Industrial revolution==
The Industrial Revolution and the arrival of the railway completely changed the landscape of certain parts of the county. Wolverton in the north (now part of Milton Keynes) became a national centre for railway carriage construction, and furniture and paper industries took hold in the south. In the centre of the county, the lace industry was introduced and grew rapidly, because it gave employment to women and children from poorer families. Queen Victoria was once quoted as preferring &quot;Bucks lace&quot; for her pillows. Buckinghamshire still has good rail links to London, Birmingham and Manchester and furniture is still a major industry in parts of south Bucks.

In the early to mid Victorian era a major cholera epidemic and agricultural famine took their hold on the farming industry which for so many years had been the stable mainstay for the county. Migration from the county to nearby cities and abroad was at its height at this time, and certain landowners took advantage of the cheaper land on offer that was left behind. One of the county&#x27;s most influential families, the Rothschilds, arrived in Bucks during this time and they built or renovated a wealth of magnificent houses in the county.

==20th century urbanisation==
Mass urbanisation of the very north and south of the county took place in the 20th century, which saw the new town of Milton Keynes being formed and Slough becoming heavily urbanised. This was a natural extension of the industrialisation of the landscape, and also provided employment for many local people. Both of these towns have (together with their surrounding areas) become unitary authorities in their own right and are administratively distinct from the area controlled by Buckinghamshire Council. Milton Keynes remains within the boundaries of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, but Slough was transferred in 1974 to Berkshire.

Today, Buckinghamshire is considered by many to be the idyllic rural landscape of Edwardian fiction and is known colloquially as &quot;leafy Bucks&quot;. This point of view is supported by much of the area being classed as Green Belt land, and has led to many parts of the county being very popular with commuters for London, which in turn has led to an increase in the general cost of living for local people. However, pockets of poverty still remain in the county, particularly in the large towns of Aylesbury and High Wycombe.

<text>The Worcester IceCats were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Worcester, Massachusetts, at the Worcester Centrum (Renamed to the DCU Center in 2004). In 2005 the team was renamed the Peoria Rivermen and moved to Peoria, Illinois.

==History==
The IceCats got their start when original New York Islanders owner Roy Boe purchased the Springfield Indians AHL franchise and moved it to Worcester in the summer of 1994. The team began play in the Fall of 1994 with a collection of free-agent players but as yet with no National Hockey League team affiliation. Immediately following the end of the 1994–95 season, Boe and head coach/General Manager Jim Roberts closed an affiliation deal with the St. Louis Blues. From that point on the IceCats would be the Blues&#x27; premier minor league team. The Peoria Rivermen of the East Coast Hockey League, in turn, became the IceCats&#x27; minor league affiliate in 1998, having been with St. Louis before the 1994 Worcester deal. During the 2000–01 season, Boe sold the IceCats to the St. Louis Blues. The team celebrated its tenth season in the AHL in fall 2003.

On November 9, 2004, the St. Louis Blues announced the sale of the IceCats to the owners of their ECHL affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen. The new owners moved the franchise to Peoria, Illinois, for the 2005–06 season.
