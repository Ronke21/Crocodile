<text>Bruno Bozzetto (born 3 March 1938) is an Italian cartoon animator and film director, creator of many short pieces, mainly of a political or satirical nature. He created his first animated short &quot;Tapum! the weapons&#x27; story&quot; in 1958 at the age of 20. His most famous character, a hapless little man named &quot;Signor Rossi&quot; (English: Mr. Rossi), has been featured in many animated shorts as well as starring in three feature films: &quot;Mr. Rossi Looks for Happiness&quot; (1976), &quot;Mr. Rossi&#x27;s Dreams&quot; (1977), and &quot;Mr. Rossi&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1977).

==Biography==
In 1965, Bozzetto produced his first feature-length animated film: &quot;West and Soda&quot;, a parody of American Western films. In 1968, Bozzetto released &quot;VIP my Brother Superman&quot;, a superhero parody. However, his best-known work is probably the 1976 feature film &quot;Allegro non troppo&quot;, a collection of short pieces set to classical music in the manner of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, but more humorous in nature, economical in execution and with more sophisticated narrative themes. After a long break, Bozzetto produced a live-action film in 1987, &quot;Under the Chinese Restaurant&quot;, his last feature film work until assisting on the pilot for &quot;Mammuk&quot; (2002), an animated film set in prehistoric times (now being produced by Rai Cinema and The Animation Band).

1990 saw the release of &quot;Grasshoppers (Cavallette)&quot;, which was an Academy Award nominee for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1991.

In 1995, he produced an animated short for Hanna-Barbera/Cartoon Network Studios&#x27; &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; series entitled &quot;Help?&quot; and in 1996, in cooperation with RAI and with the support of Cartoon (Media Programme of the European Union), he created &quot;The Spaghetti Family&quot;, a 26-episode cartoon television series.

Since 1999, Bozzetto turned to flash cartoons, most notably with the award-winning &quot;Europe and Italy&quot;, a witty and graphically elegant commentary on European vs. Italian socio-cultural attributes. This comic also inspired the creation of the Polandball meme.

<text>Modena Football Club 2018, commonly referred to as Modena, is an Italian football club based in Modena, Emilia-Romagna. The club was founded in 1912, and refounded in 2018, having spent the majority of its existence playing in Serie B. They play in Serie B, having won 2021–22 Serie C&#x27;s Group B title.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
Modena Football Club was formed in on 5 April 1912 as the result of a merging between existing Modenese clubs, &quot;Football Club Audax Modena&quot; and &quot;l&#x27; Associazione Studentesca del Calcio Modena&quot;. The new colours were to be yellow and blue. Modena&#x27;s first friendly match was played on 3 November 1912 in the Piazza d&#x27;Armi against Venezia.

Modena first took part Italian football league in 1912–13, where they competed in the top division. These early years saw the purchase of Attilio Fresia, perhaps the greatest player in the club&#x27;s history. During the period of the first world war, the team won the 1916 Coppa Federale.

In 1920–21, Modena lost 4–0 in the championship semi-finals to Alessandria. In the years following, there was a period of disorganization in Italian football and Modena found itself at odds with the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and moved to the CI Comitato Calcistico Italiano along with Internazionale, Venezia, Torino, Genoa and others. In 1929–30, their first in Serie A (then a single round consisting of 18 teams), the club finished in 12th place with 30 points.

In 1931–32 came the club&#x27;s first relegation to Serie B, where they remained until 1937. The 1936–37 season featured the inauguration of Modena&#x27;s new stadium, dedicated to Cesare Marzari, a former &quot;gialloblu&quot; played killed in the war in Africa. During these years, the name was changed to Modena Calcio following directives of the regime aimed at eliminating all foreign words in the sports lexicon. In the 1937–38 season, there was a return to Serie A led by the Hungarian player/coach János Nehadoma. The following season, Modena escaped relegation by just one point. The 1939–40 campaign was the year when the numbers first appeared on the shirts of players, but at the end of the season, the yellow and blue were relegated to Serie B.

===1940s, 50s and 60s===
In 1940–41, Modena returned to Serie A despite World War II considerably reducing the workforce. The following year, they fell back to Serie B. At the end of the war, however, Modena finished third in Serie A, just behind Torino and Juventus. Following the resignation of both the president and coach in 1948–49, however, the squad was relegated back to Serie B.

The club remained in Serie B throughout the 1950s. Tenor Luciano Pavarotti played on the team, making several appearances as a winger. In 1957–58, Zenit became the sponsor of the team, providing 100 million lira for promotion to Serie A, but the team finished only in seventh place. In 1959–60, the sponsor withdrew and the team was relegated to Serie C for the first time.

The 1960s began with Modena in Serie C. In 1960–61, under coach Malagoli, the team was promoted to Serie B, and the next year found Modena back in the top flight due in large part to the efforts of striker Enrico Pagliari (26 goals in 2 seasons). The following year, thanks mainly to the Brazilian Chinesinho, Modena achieved safety in Serie A, but in 1963–64, despite the return of Sergio Brighenti, Modena fell back to Serie B after a playoff defeat to Sampdoria played in Milan. For the remainder of the 1960s, the club played in Serie B.

===1970s, 80s and 90s===
In 1971–72, after changing three coaches, Modena again fell down to Serie C. Following consecutive seventh-place finishes in Serie C, Modena finally was promoted back to Serie B in 1974–75. In 1976–77, Modena achieved safety in Serie B only by beating Monza on the last day of the season. 1977–78 saw a corporate crisis in which the club was relegated to Serie C. In the following season, it was relegated even further down to Serie C2, its lowest point since the club was founded.

The beginning of the 1980s saw Modena back to Serie C1 and out of its economic crisis. Modena even won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1981 and 1982. In 1985–86, they returned to Serie B behind the 21 goals scored by Sauro Frutti. In the following season, the club was dramatically saved from relegation on the final day, beating local rivals Bologna in the derby. But in 1987–88, Modena were again relegated to Serie C1.

The 1989–90 season saw Modena promoted back to Serie B, led by their manager Renzo Ulivieri and goalkeeper Marco Ballotta who allowed a record low 9 goals conceded in 34 games. In 1991–92, following the departure of Ulivieri for Vicenza, Modena was again saved from relegation on the final day, beating Messina 2–1. The rest of the decade saw the club in tumultuous financial and sporting position, as in 1993–94 the team was relegated to C1. A year later, Modena was surprisingly relegated to C2 after losing a play-out with Massese, however the club was rescued by the FIGC due to another team&#x27;s penalty, ensuring Modena&#x27;s status in C1. The following year, only a loss to Lumezzane in the play-offs denied the club&#x27;s promotion.

===2000s to 2017 and beyond===
In 2000–01, despite the death of the chairman Luigi Montagnani in the summer, the team begins a cycle of two great years: first promoted from Serie C1 to Serie B and the following year the club returned to Serie A for the first time in 38 years. Modena begin their stint back in the top flight with a humbling 0–3 defeat at the hand of Milan, but followed it up with a historic 2–1 victory against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. The rest of the season was difficult, however, Modena secured its Serie A status on the last day of the season. The following season saw the club finish third from bottom on 30 points to be sent back to Serie B where they remained until their relegation to the third division at the end of the 2015-16 season.

On 5 November 2017, Modena was declared bankrupt after failing to pay player wages or stadium bills, which brought about a player strike and a stadium lockout. The club had not attended the previous three Serie C matches, including the match against Santarcangelo Calcio; with a total of four matches not attended, the club were officially excluded from &quot;Lega Pro&quot; on 6 November.

Following that, Modena Mayor Gian Carlo Muzzarelli issued a public manifestation of interest to entrepreneurs interested in reviving football in Modena by forming a new club to take the vacancy left by the dissolution of the &quot;Canarini&quot;. The task fell to former club president Romano Amadei, who re-founded the club and registered it in time for the 2018–19 Serie D. Former Modena sports director Doriano Tosi returned and former manager Luigi Apolloni, who gained promotion to Serie C with Parma in 2016, was appointed manager. Former Modena player Armando Perna was the first signing of the newborn side.

Modena ended the season in first place, together with Pergolettese; this forced a one-legged playoff to be hold, which ended in a 1–2 loss for the &quot;Canarini&quot;. However, Modena were readmitted to Serie C in July 2019 to fill a league vacancy.

In 2022, Modena finally won back a spot in the Italian second division, following a successful 2021–22 Serie C season under the guidance of experienced manager Attilio Tesser which saw them winning the Group B title with a two-point margin over rivals Reggiana.

<text>Rune Glifberg (born 7 October 1974), nicknamed &quot;The Danish Destroyer&quot;, is a Danish professional skateboarder. He is one of three skaters to have competed at every X Games. He has a total of 12 X Games medals. At 46, he became the oldest skateboarder to ever compete in the Olympic Games and the first male skateboarder to ever compete in a park event in the Olympic Games when he represented Denmark in the men&#x27;s park event at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

==Early life==
Rune Glifberg was born in Copenhagen and began skating at the age of 11 years after a friend brought a skateboard as a gift, which he had bought in the US. He entered his first pro contest in France in 1990 and turned pro in 1992. Glifberg moved from Denmark to Costa Mesa, California, after he finished secondary school in 1995.

==Professional skateboarding==
In the early 1990s, Glifberg turned professional as a vert skater and relocated to the United States. Glifberg signed a contract with Flip Skateboards and, as of July 2021, he remains a member of the company&#x27;s professional team.

Glifberg was sponsored by shoe company Etnies at around the same time as he joined Flip and his second signature shoe was called the , meaning &quot;defend&quot; or &quot;defense&quot; in Danish. As of September 2012, Glifberg has released a line of signature shoes with Converse that consists of &quot;The Allston&quot; and the &quot;Rune Pro Mid&quot; models.

Glifberg is a playable character in the first five games of the Tony Hawk series of video games that consists of the four &quot;Pro Skater&quot; games and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;.

==Company owner==
Glifberg is a part-owner of Pipeline Distribution and runs a Copenhagen-based event company &quot;RunEvent&quot;. RunEvent was the organizer of 2010&#x27;s &quot;Burning of the Witch&quot; skateboard contest at Amager Strandpark in Copenhagen. Burning of the Witch was jointly sponsored by Volcom, one of Glifberg&#x27;s sponsors, and &quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot;. RunEvent organized Glifberg&#x27;s 25th skateboarding anniversary that was held at Fælledparken in Copenhagen during the summer of 2011.

In 2009, Glifberg and architect Ebbe Lykke founded the skatepark design firm Glifberg+Lykke in Copenhagen. The duo have since taken the lead on a number of projects in Europe, including the Streetdome in Haderslev, Denmark; Oslo Skatehall in Oslo, Norway; Skatepark Eller in Düsseldorf, Germany; and the Urban Sport Zone in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
==Personal life==
Glifberg resided in the United States for seventeen years, living for a period in the Leucadia district of Encinitas, California. He moved back to Denmark in the early 2010s and, as of 2021, is based in Copenhagen.

<doc id="1136889" wikidata="Q212388" url="?curid=1136889" title="Omar al-Mukhtar">
<text>ʿUmar al-Mukhtār Muḥammad [[Patronymic#Arabic|bin]] Farḥāt al-Manifī (; 20 August 1858 – 16 September 1931), called The Lion of the Desert, known among the colonial Italians as Matari of the Mnifa, was a Libyan revolutionary and Imam who led the native resistance in Cyrenaica (currently Eastern Libya) under the Senussids, against the Italian colonization of Libya. A teacher-turned-general, Omar was a prominent figure of the Senussi movement and is considered the national hero of Libya and a symbol of resistance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. Beginning in 1911, he organised and led the Libyan resistance movement against the Italian colonial empire during the First and Second Italo-Senussi Wars. Externally, he also fought against the French colonization of Chad and the British occupation of Egypt. After many attempts, the Italian Armed Forces managed to capture Al-Mukhtar near Slonta when he was wounded in battle by Libyan colonial troops, and hanged him in 1931 after he refused to surrender.

==Early life==
Omar Al-Mukhtar was born in 1858 in the town of Zanzur near Tobruk, in the region of Ottoman Cyrenaica to the Arab Mnifa tribe, belonging to the Senussi (who were seen as Libyan Ashrafs clan just like Emir or King Idris es Senussi), before eventually becoming chief or leader of the clan. As a child, Omar lost his father early on and spent his youth in poverty. He was adopted by a sheikh, and was friends with the nephew of Hussein Ghariani, Sharif al Geriani. His uncle was a political-religious leader in Cyrenaica, and he received his early education at the local mosque, before continuing his studies for eight years at the Senussi University in Jaghbub, the holy city of the Senussi Tariqa. He became a popular expert on the Quran and an imam, joining the confraternity of the Senussi. He also came to be well informed of the social structure of his society, as he was chosen to settle intertribal disputes.

Mukhtar developed a strong relationship with the Senussid Movement during his years in Jaghbub and in 1895, Al-Mahdi Senoussi traveled with him south to Kufra, and on another occasion further south to Karo in Chad, where he was appointed as sheikh of Zawiyat Ayn Kalk. When the French Empire encroached on Chad in 1899, he was sent among other Senussites to help defend Chad from the French, as the Senussi considered their expansion dangerous due to their missionary activities in Central and West Africa. In 1902, Omar was recalled north after the death of Al-Mahdi, the new Senussi leader Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi appointed him as Sheikh of the troubled Zawiyat Laqsur in Northern Cyrenaica.

== Italian invasion ==


In October 1911, during the Italo-Turkish War, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Italian Royal Navy) under the command of Admiral Luigi Faravelli reached the shores of Libya, then a territory subject to Ottoman control. The admiral demanded that the Ottoman administration and garrison surrender their territory to the Italians or incur the immediate destruction of the city of Tripoli and Benghazi. The Ottomans and their Libyan allies withdrew to the countryside instead of surrendering, and the Italians bombarded the cities for three days, and then proclaimed the Tripolitanians to be &#x27;committed and strongly bound to Italy&#x27;. This marked the beginning of a series of battles between the Italian colonial forces and the Libyan armed opposition in Cyrenaica.

== Guerrilla warfare ==


A teacher of the Qur&#x27;an by profession, Mukhtar was also skilled in the strategies and tactics of desert warfare. He knew local geography well and used that knowledge to advantage in battles against the Italians, who were unaccustomed to desert warfare. Mukhtar repeatedly led his small, highly alert groups in successful attacks against the Italians, after which they would fade back into the desert terrain. Mukhtar’s men skilfully attacked outposts, ambushed troops, and cut lines of supply and communication. The &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Italian Royal Army) was left astonished and embarrassed by his guerrilla tactics.

In the mountainous region of Jebel Akhdar (&quot;Green Mountain&quot;) in 1924, Italian governor Ernesto Bombelli created a counter-guerrilla force that inflicted a severe setback to guerilla forces in April 1925. Mukhtar then quickly modified his own tactics and was able to count on continued help from Egypt. In March 1927, despite the occupation of Giarabub from February 1926 and increasingly stringent rule under Governor Attilio Teruzzi, Mukhtar surprised Italian troops at Raheiba. In 1927 and 1928, Mukhtar reorganised the Senusite forces, who were being hunted constantly by the Italians. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, Governor of Libya from January 1929, after extensive negotiations, concluded a compromise with Mukhtar (described by the Italians as his complete submission) similar to previous Italo-Senusite accords. At the end of October 1929, Mukhtar denounced the compromise and re-established a unity of action among Libyan forces, preparing himself for the ultimate confrontation with General Rodolfo Graziani, the Italian military commander from March 1930. A massive offensive in June against Mukhtar&#x27;s forces having failed, Graziani, in full accord with Badoglio, Emilio De Bono (Minister of the Colonies), and Benito Mussolini, initiated a plan to break the Libyan Mujāhideen: the 100,000 people of Jebel Akhdar would be relocated to concentration camps on the coast, and the Libyan-Egyptian border from the coast at Giarabub would be fence-closed, preventing any foreign help to the fighters and depriving them of support from the native population. These measures, which Graziani initiated early in 1931, took their toll on the Senusite resistance. The rebels were deprived of help and reinforcements, spied upon, hit by Italian aircraft, and pursued on the ground by the Italian forces aided by local informers and collaborators. 

Mukhtar&#x27;s final adversary, Italian General Rodolfo Graziani, has given a description of the Senusite leader that is not lacking in respect: &quot;Of medium height, stout, with white hair, beard, and mustache. Omar was endowed with a quick and lively intelligence; was knowledgeable in religious matters, and revealed an energetic and impetuous character, unselfish and uncompromising; ultimately, he remained very religious and poor, even though he had been one of the most important Senusist figures.&quot;

== Capture and execution ==
Mukhtar&#x27;s struggle of nearly twenty years came to an end on 11 September 1931, when he was wounded in battle near Slonta, and then captured by Libyan Savaris of the Italian Army. On 16 September 1931, on the orders of the Italian court and with Italian hopes that Libyan resistance would die with him, Mukhtar was hanged before his followers in Soluch concentration camp at the age of 73.

==Legacy==

*Omar Al-Mukhtar University was founded in 1961.
* Since 1971, Mukhtar&#x27;s face has appeared on the Libyan ten-dinar note.
* His final years were depicted in the movie &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot; (1981), starring Anthony Quinn, Oliver Reed, and Irene Papas. It was based on the struggles of Mukhtar against Rodolfo Graziani&#x27;s forces. 
* A statement by the Omar used in the movie has been popularized by Muslims, . &quot;We are people that will not surrender, we win or we die.&quot;
* In 2009, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi wore a photograph of Mukhtar in Italian captivity on his chest while on a state visit to Rome, and brought along Mukhtar&#x27;s elderly son during the visit.
* With the Libyan Civil War beginning 17 February 2011, Omar Mukhtar again became a symbol for a united, free Libya and his picture was depicted on various flags and posters of the anti-Gaddafist forces. Rebel militias named one of their brigades the &quot;Omar Mukhtar brigade&quot; after him.
* A school is named after Mukhtar in Irbid, Jordan
* A masjid is named after Mukhtar in Tampa, Florida, USA, known as Masjid Omar Al Mokhtar.
*Streets are named after Mukhtar in:

<doc id="1136892" wikidata="Q1755814" url="?curid=1136892" title="Shangri-La (Mark Knopfler album)">
<text>Shangri-La is the fourth solo studio album by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, released on 28 September 2004 by Mercury Records internationally and Warner Bros. Records in the United States. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; received generally favorable reviews.

==Background==
In March 2003, Knopfler was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road, Belgravia, and suffered a broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade, and seven broken ribs. The planned Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream Tour was subsequently cancelled. Knopfler spent seven months away from the guitar in physiotherapy, but eventually recovered and was able to return to the studio in 2004 for his fourth album and supporting tour the following year.

==Recording==
&quot;Shangri-La&quot; was recorded in February 2004 at Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California.

==Composition==
The album features Knopfler&#x27;s signature storytelling style of songwriting. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Boom, Like That&quot;, was inspired by Ray Kroc&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Grinding It Out&quot;, and the starting of McDonald&#x27;s, using many of Mr. Kroc&#x27;s exact words. &quot;Song for Sonny Liston&quot; is a song about the famous boxer, Sonny Liston. &quot;Donegan&#x27;s Gone&quot; is about Scottish musician and singer Lonnie Donegan. &quot;5.15 AM&quot; tells the story of the 1967 &quot;one-armed bandit murder&quot;. &quot;Back to Tupelo&quot; is about the life of Elvis Presley and his acting career. The album was released on LP, HDCD and in 5.1 Surround Sound on Super Audio CD (SACD) and DVD-Audio.

==Touring==

Knopfler supported the release of &quot;Shangri-La&quot; with the Shangri-La Tour, which consisted of three legs: South Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; Europe; and North America. The tour started on 28 February 2005 in Johannesburg, South Africa, and included 104 concerts in 95 cities, ending on 31 July 2005 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The tour included a five-night run at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The tour lineup included Mark Knopfler (guitar, vocals), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Richard Bennett (guitar), Matt Rollings (piano), Glenn Worf (bass), and Chad Cromwell (drums).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; received generally favorable reviews. In his review for AllMusic, James Christopher Monger gave the album three and a half out of five stars, noting that on this album, Knopfler abandoned the British folk and Celtic-influenced pop that populated his earlier solo albums and chose instead a &quot;full-blown yet quiet and considerate collection of country-folk ballads and bluesy, midtempo dirges that revel in their uncharacteristic sparseness.&quot; Instead of writing about his brush with mortality—the wry &quot;Don&#x27;t Crash the Ambulance&quot; aside—Knopfler uses his &quot;warm baritone and effortless guitar work&quot; to explore everything from the plight of the modern fisherman (on the beautiful and rustic &quot;Trawlerman&#x27;s Song&quot;), to the entrepreneurial skills of McDonald&#x27;s founder Ray Kroc (on &quot;Boom, Like That&quot;). Monger concludes:
In his review for &quot;The Music Box&quot;, John Metzger gave the album an &quot;excellent&quot; four out of five stars, writing that Knopfler has rarely sounded so relaxed and his arrangements so unassuming. Metzger continued:
In his review for &quot;MusicTap&quot;, George Bennett gave the album four out of five stars, calling Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Shangri-La&quot; the &quot;best album of his solo career&quot;. Bennett writes that Knopfler has produced &quot;the most melodic, tasteful, laid-back yet wholly engrossing tunes&quot; of his solo career. Bennett concluded that &quot;Shangri-La&quot; contains the best music and lyrics of Knopfler&#x27;s solo career—the first album to &quot;stand up solidly to anything Dire Straits did.&quot;

<doc id="1136900" wikidata="Q188547" url="?curid=1136900" title="Castiglione della Pescaia">
<text>Castiglione della Pescaia (), regionally simply abbreviated as Castiglione, is an ancient seaside town in the province of Grosseto, in Tuscany, central Italy. The modern city grew around a medieval 12th century fortress () and a large fishery, from which it acquired its designation. Today Castiglione is a very popular tourist destination with attractions that include beaches, natural parks, biking trails, historical Etruscan archaeological sites, a panoramic mediaeval hamlet as well as the natural reserve &quot;Diaccia Botrona&quot;, a swampy humid environment of historical relevance whose endangered wildlife comprise pink flamingoes, mallards and ducks. 
Castiglione della Pescaia is home to the second most expensive street in Italy for property prices, with average values exceeding those of homes in every other Italian street except one, also in Tuscany.

== Geography ==

Castiglione della Pescaia consists of a High City built on the hill that ends a chain of hills towards the sea, and of a Low City at the foot of the former, straddling the drainage canal and marina that form the central part of town.

Castiglione is located in the South-Western portion of Tuscany, with a view of the islands of Elba and Giglio, and of the promontory of Argentario. The hills that back the city slope into beaches that front the town in its entirety.
To the East of Castiglione is the rich floodplain of the Ombrone river. Nothing much remains of the ancient lake Prile that used to be Castiglione&#x27;s lifeblood.

Despite Castiglione&#x27;s popularity as a holiday destination, the town&#x27;s natural surroundings - including the sea, marshes and pinewoods typical of the Maremma area - have been meticulously preserved and are today forming protected natural reserves. Notably, in 2015 Castiglione&#x27;s sea was nominated as Italy&#x27;s most beautiful by the national non-governmental environmentalist organisation Legambiente, which not only praised the town&#x27;s seawater cleanliness but also its environmental efforts and efficient recycling.

Castiglione is the most visited seaside destination in Tuscany and it ranks second among the most visited cities in the region, being only preceded by Florence. In 2019, approximately 1.6 million tourists visited Castiglione reaching an historic record. The town is also one of the most visited in Italy.
== History ==

While Umbrians and Etruscans were most likely the first inhabitants of its location, Castiglione della Pescaia was first recorded under the name Salebrone in Roman times. The hill close to the coast proved to be an excellent location, as it dominated the sizable inland Prelius Lake, while the lake itself provided fish for food and salt, which could be traded.

In the Middle Ages, the city suffered repeated pirate attacks and almost disappeared. It resurfaced in the 9th century AD under its current name, under joint protection of the Papacy and the Republic of Pisa.

The Pisans used Castiglione as a key element in their system of defence along the Tyrrhenian coast. They built first a single tower on top of the hill, later expanded that to three towers joined by a wall that became the nucleus of the citadel. The three towers of Castiglione dominate the city seal to this day.

In the 13th century, Castiglione became an independent &quot;comune&quot;. Meanwhile, the river Ombrone had started silting up Lake Prile, which soon became a lagoon. In this newly formed lagoon, malaria mosquitoes took hold, weakening the population of Castiglione. The city requested protection from various powers (Siena, the Medici, Aragon) and finally became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

The House of Lorraine started a series of projects that greatly enhanced the lives of Castiglionesi. The swamps were drained over decades, increasing the amount of arable land, as well as killing off the malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

After Tuscany became part of Italy in 1859, Castiglione became a comune in the province of Grosseto.

==Government==
=== &quot;Frazioni&quot; ===
The municipality is formed by the municipal seat of Castiglione della Pescaia and the villages (&quot;frazioni&quot;) and hamlets of Buriano, Macchiascandona, Pian d&#x27;Alma, Pian di Rocca, Punta Ala, Roccamare, Rocchette, Tirli and Vetulonia.

=== List of mayors ===
== Main sights==
One of the most popular tourist destinations in the area is the historical Etruscan centre of Vetulonia, which hosts an Etruscan museum with an adjacent well preserved archaeological site, encompassing ancient remains of the old inhabitants of Maremma. Furthermore, the hamlets of Punta Ala, Riva del Sole, Roccamare and Rocchette are beach resorts catering mostly tourists from Central and Northern Europe.

In the territory of Castiglione della Pescaia, the Natural Reserve of Diaccia Botrona (with 18th-century Casa Rossa Ximenes) is a designated wetland area of international interest, according to the Ramsar Convention.

<text>167 (one hundred [and] sixty-seven) is the natural number following 166 and preceding 168.

==In mathematics==
167 is the 39th prime number, an emirp, an isolated prime, a Chen prime, a Gaussian prime, a safe prime, and an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and a real part of the form formula_1.

167 is the smallest number which requires six terms when expressed using the greedy algorithm as a sum of squares, 167 = 144 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1,
although by Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem its non-greedy expression as a sum of squares can be shorter, e.g. 167 = 121 + 36 + 9 + 1.

167 is a full reptend prime in base 10, since the decimal expansion of 1/167 repeats the following 166 digits: 0.00598802395209580838323353293413173652694610778443113772455089820359281437125748502994 0119760479041916167664670658682634730538922155688622754491017964071856287425149700...

167 is a highly cototient number, as it is the smallest number &quot;k&quot; with exactly 15 solutions to the equation &quot;x&quot; - φ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;k&quot;. It is also a strictly non-palindromic number.

167 is the smallest multi-digit prime such that the product of digits is equal to the number of digits times the sum of the digits, i. e., 1×6×7 = 3×(1+6+7)

167 is the smallest positive integer &quot;d&quot; such that the imaginary quadratic field Q() has class number = 11.

<text>Jeff Chandler (born Ira Grossel; December 15, 1918 – June 17, 1961) was an American actor. He was best known for his portrayal of Cochise in &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was one of Universal Pictures&#x27; more popular male stars of the 1950s. His other credits include &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot; (1948), &quot;Deported&quot; (1950), &quot;Female on the Beach&quot; (1955), and &quot;Away All Boats&quot; (1956). He also performed as a radio actor and as a singer.

==Early life==
Chandler was born Ira Grossel in Brooklyn, New York City, the only child of Jewish parents Anna (née Herman) and Phillip Grossel. He was raised by his mother after his parents separated when he was a child.

He attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he acted in school plays; his schoolmates included Susan Hayward. Chandler&#x27;s father was connected with the restaurant business and got his son a job as a restaurant cashier. Chandler said he always wanted to act, but courses for commercial art were cheaper, so he studied art for a year and worked as a layout artist for a mail-order catalogue at $18 a week.

Eventually, he saved up enough money to take a drama course at the Feagin School of Dramatic Art in New York. He worked briefly in radio, then got a job in a stock company on Long Island as an actor and stage manager. He worked for two years in stock companies, including a performance of &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; opposite famous singers and actors Gordon MacRae and his wife Sheila MacRae, who became his good friends.

Chandler formed his own company, the Shady Lane Playhouse, in Illinois in the summer of 1941. The company toured the Midwest with some success, presenting such plays as &quot;The Bad Man&quot;, &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, &quot;The New Minister&quot;, and &quot;Pigs&quot;. When America entered World War II, Chandler enlisted in the army. He served for four years, mostly in the Aleutians, finishing with the rank of lieutenant.

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
After being discharged from the army, Chandler moved to Los Angeles in December 1945 with $3,000 he had saved. Shortly after his arrival, he was involved in a serious car accident on the way to a screen test, which resulted in a large scar on his forehead.

Chandler initially struggled to find work in Hollywood, and had spent all his savings when he got his first job as a radio actor in May 1946. He went on to appear in episodes of anthology drama series such as &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;, and became well known for playing the lead in &quot;Michael Shayne&quot;. Chandler was the first actor to portray Chad Remington in &quot;Frontier Town&quot;.

=== Early film roles ===
Chandler had appeared on air in &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot; with Dick Powell, who was impressed by the actor, and put pressure on Columbia to give Chandler his first film role, a small part as a gangster in &quot;Johnny O&#x27;Clock&quot; (1947). He tested for Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; but did not get the part. He went on to play small roles as gangsters in &quot;Roses are Red&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Wall&quot;, and a policeman in &quot;Mr Belvedere Goes to College&quot;. Chandler received more attention playing Eve Arden&#x27;s love interest on radio in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, which debuted in July 1948 and became a massive hit.

His performance in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; brought him to the attention of executives at Universal, who were looking for someone to play an Israeli leader in &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot; (1949). He was cast in February 1949. Chandler impressed studio executives so much with his work that shortly into filming, Universal signed him to a seven-year contract. His first film under the arrangement was a supporting role in &quot;Abandoned&quot; (1949).
=== &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and stardom ===
Writer-director Delmer Daves was looking for an actor to play Cochise in &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950) at 20th Century Fox. The part was proving tricky to cast; in Chandler&#x27;s words, &quot;Fox was looking for a guy big enough physically to play the role and unfamiliar enough to moviegoers to lend authenticity.&quot; Chandler&#x27;s performance as a similar resistance leader-type in &quot;Sword of the Desert&quot; brought him to the studio&#x27;s attention, and he was borrowed from Universal for the role in May 1949. As part of the arrangement, Chandler signed a deal with Fox to make a film a year with them for six years. He also had to be written out of his radio shows &quot;Michael Shayne&quot; and &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; for several weeks.

&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; turned out to be a considerable hit, earning Chandler an Oscar nomination and establishing him as a star. He was the first actor nominated for an Academy Award for portraying an American Indian.

Even before &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was released, Chandler was upped to leading-man status back at Universal. He was meant to make &quot;Death on a Sidestreet&quot; and &quot;The Lady Count&quot; but neither ended up being made. Instead, he took over a role originally meant for Dana Andrews, a Lucky Luciano-style gangster in &quot;Deported&quot;, for producer Robert Buckner, who cast him in &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I got it,&quot; Chandler joked at the time, &quot;maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m saving them money.&quot; The movie was shot on location in Italy, although Chandler&#x27;s radio commitments meant some of it had to be filmed in Hollywood.

He went back to Fox for his second film for them, as an embittered Union cavalryman in &quot;Two Flags West&quot; for director Robert Wise. Chandler replaced Lee J. Cobb, and it was one of his least-typical roles, a character part rather than a leading man. Once again, location work required him to regularly commute back and forth to Hollywood throughout the shoot.

Returning to Universal, Chandler played an adventurer in &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Island&quot;, a role he liked because he said it was close to his real personality. Hollywood tended to cast him, though, in different nationalities. According to one profile, &quot;he has unusual face, with taut, bony features, which seem to fit neatly into any sort of role&quot;.

He was reunited with Fox and Delmer Daves to play a Polynesian chief in &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1951), which Chandler admitted was a variation of his performance as Cochise. It was the last film he made outside Universal for a number of years.

Back at Universal, he played a boxer in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1951), a remake of an old Lew Ayres movie. He was announced for another film with Buckner, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, which was not made; instead, he played an Arab chief in &quot;Flame of Araby&quot; (1951), opposite Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

Around this time, Chandler expressed his dissatisfaction with acting in film as opposed to radio:

[Radio actors] have to make their roles come alive, and they only have their voices with which to do it, but in pictures, the technique is quite different. The actor is only a small part of the performance. He lends his intelligence and personality to the role, but the greatest part of the performance belongs to the producer, who puts him in a certain type of part; the director, who tells him how to play it; and the cutter, who edits what&#x27;s done. That&#x27;s why I find being a movie actor not particularly gratifying. I want to eventually branch off into writing and directing.

Chandler reprised his role as Cochise in another Western, &quot;The Battle at Apache Pass&quot;, for Universal. He then went on to make a war film, &quot;Red Ball Express&quot;, and a swashbuckler, &quot;Yankee Buccaneer&quot;. He made a cameo in &quot;Meet Danny Wilson&quot; and had a change of pace when he supported Loretta Young in &quot;Because of You&quot; – which a few years later he called his favorite role. Young later said Chandler &quot;was more of a personality than an actor... a charming man.&quot;

In 1952, exhibitors voted Chandler the 22nd-most popular star in the US. 20th Century-Fox was keen to use Chandler again and offered him roles in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and &quot;The Secret of Convict Lake&quot;. Universal refused to lend him, though, as he was now one of their biggest stars.

&quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; transferred to television, but Chandler was not permitted to do TV under his contract; his part was taken by Robert Rockwell. On Peggy Lee&#x27;s radio show, he had demonstrated a talent for singing, and he pursued this through the decade.

===New contract===
In July 1952, Chandler signed a fresh contract with Universal that doubled his salary. His first movie under this was a Western, &quot;The Great Sioux Uprising&quot;. It was followed by more adventure fare: &quot;East of Sumatra&quot; and &quot;War Arrow&quot; with Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

This meant Chandler missed the part of Demetrius in &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953) at Fox, for which he had been considered and which eventually went to Victor Mature. He also missed out on the lead in the remake of &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot;, for which he had been mooted; the part was taken by Rock Hudson, who had supported Chandler in &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Both &quot;The Robe&quot; and &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; became big hits. Chandler played Cochise for the third time, a cameo in &quot;Taza, Son of Cochise&quot;, starring Hudson, who soon overtook Chandler as Universal&#x27;s biggest male star.

Universal announced him for &quot;Chief Crazy Horse&quot;, but the role ended up being played by Victor Mature. Instead, he appeared in &quot;Yankee Pasha&quot;, and started singing in nightclubs. He left the radio show &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; after five years &quot;to get a rest,&quot; he said, &quot;Although it didn&#x27;t take long to do the show, it tied up all my Sundays.&quot;

Chandler appeared in an expensive (for Universal) epic, playing the Emperor Marcian in &quot;Sign of the Pagan&quot; and co-starred with Jane Russell in &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1955), which he enjoyed because, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to be so darned monosyllabic in this one.&quot; He then made &quot;Female on the Beach&quot; with Joan Crawford and began releasing records.

===Conflicts with Universal===
In 1954, Chandler was starting to recognize how heavy his workload was:

You just can&#x27;t call your time your own. When you&#x27;re trekking the country – as I am now for my Decca records &quot;I Should Care&quot; and &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; and for Universal International, my home studio – every hour of the day, from the morning disc jockeys to the midnight program is filled. And in Hollywood, if you&#x27;re not working on a picture or getting ready for one, you have to keep studying. I make a point of answering all my mail, and when anyone asks me for an autograph, I&#x27;m not just flattered. I see that as the least I can do for the people who have given me the fruits of this world.

In May, Chandler refused to play the lead in &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot; and Universal put him on suspension. He was replaced in the role by George Nader. Chandler spoke of making &quot;Young Moses&quot; and a Western with friends Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, but neither film was made. He said that &quot;being a movie star isn&#x27;t worth it&quot;:

I can&#x27;t go anywhere as an ordinary individual. There was a time I could walk around Times Square in New York (my home town) and look into shop windows or go into a cafe and eat in peace. But no more. I can&#x27;t go anywhere unnoticed. Movie fans seem to think that actors belong to them, but we like to feel we belong to ourselves. Don&#x27;t get me wrong – I wanted fame and money when I decided to take up acting. I like being recognized – it&#x27;s flattering. But there&#x27;s always one character who spoils anything... I walk into a restaurant and get a ringside table- but you remember I also have to leave the biggest tip. If I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m labeled the tightest guy in town. And let&#x27;s face it, acting is the easiest way I know to make a buck. But I think I&#x27;m a fairly bright boy – I figure I could have made as much in some other business... Anyone in the world with imagination and initiative can become a success. Me? I like to push buttons. I was born to be an executive – an idea man. An executive is a guy who thinks things up and has other people execute them. I&#x27;d quit work immediately if I had the money, and travel for a while. I&#x27;d like to do some writing. I marked two radio scripts and have finished synopses and five movie stories.

Chandler made up with Universal, which cast him in &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot;. Chandler refused the role and was replaced again by George Nader, but this time, the dispute was not over money, but due to Chandler&#x27;s overwork.

Universal cast Chandler in an expensive remake of &quot;The Spoilers&quot;, then was given the lead in one of the studio&#x27;s most prestigious films of the year, &quot;Away All Boats&quot;.

In May, Chandler performed at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Chandler &quot;is proving remarkable in performing singing duty, even though he is not exactly a singing type&quot;.
He made a Western, &quot;Pillars of the Sky&quot;, then had a change of pace with the comedy &quot;The Toy Tiger&quot;, the fourth movie he made that year. Louella Parsons called Chandler &quot;the busiest actor in town... Jeff is so happy in his private life these days that he&#x27;s doing everything the studio wants.&quot;

Towards the end of the year, Chandler formed his own production company, Earlmar, with his agent Meyer Mishkin. This was to take effect from August 1956 onwards, when Chandler&#x27;s exclusive contract with Universal expired. However, Chandler intended to continue to make films for Universal under a multipicture contract. He was voted the seventh-most popular star with British cinema goers.

=== Producer and new contract with Universal ===
In 1956, Universal gave Chandler a leave of absence from his contract with them &quot;for a period of several months&quot; to enable him to make his own movie for Earlmar. In exchange for this, Chandler was to make two more films for Universal under his original contract with them, then enter into a new arrangement under which he would appear in two films a year over three years.

Earlmar signed a six-picture deal with United Artists, under which Chandler was to appear in at least three of the films. He acted in and produced the first Earlmar production, a Western, &quot;Drango&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s no Indian story,&quot; said Chandler, &quot;let Cochise rest in peace.&quot; Chandler bought the rights to a novel, &quot;Lincoln McEever&quot;, but it was never made; &quot;Drango&quot; turned out to be Earlmar&#x27;s sole production.

After &quot;Drango&quot;, Chandler made the final two films owed under his original contract with Universal: &quot;The Tattered Dress&quot;, playing a lawyer in a melodrama, and &quot;Man in the Shadow&quot;, co-starring opposite Orson Welles. He had commitments to make two films per year at Universal until 1959.

=== Freelance star ===
Chandler moved to Columbia Pictures and acted with Kim Novak in &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot;.

He followed this with two films for Universal, &quot;The Lady Takes a Flyer&quot; with Lana Turner, and &quot;Raw Wind in Eden&quot; with Esther Williams. A Motion Picture Exhibitor Poll listed him as the tenth-most popular male star in the US in 1957.

Chandler made another for Universal, &quot;A Stranger in My Arms&quot; with June Allyson. He was to star opposite Tony Curtis in &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959), but fell ill and had to withdraw.

Chandler&#x27;s next two movies were made for a brand new company, Seven Arts: &quot;Ten Seconds to Hell&quot;, a drama with Jack Palance for director Robert Aldrich, and &quot;Thunder in the Sun&quot;, a Western with Susan Hayward.

The last of those was distributed by Paramount, which released Chandler&#x27;s next film, another Western, &quot;The Jayhawkers!&quot; In &quot;Ten Seconds to Hell&quot; and &quot;The Jayhawkers!&quot; Chandler played villains. He later reflected &quot;I&#x27;ve tried heavies – but audiences didn&#x27;t seem to take to that.&quot;

Chandler formed another production company, August, for which he made &quot;The Plunderers&quot;, a Western, distributed by Allied Artists. Allied was so pleased with the film, they requested three more movies from August, but Chandler never got to make them.

His next film, &quot;The Story of David&quot;, was filmed for American TV, his first work in that medium, but was shown theatrically in other countries. It was shot in London and Israel. Chandler stated:

I don&#x27;t want to make pictures in other countries; I want to stay home. But suddenly there are not enough pictures being made here. All other countries are giving inducements to companies and to players; even a little country like Israel is trying to formulate a plan for subsidies. Our government still taxes the hell out of people; somebody ought to wake &#x27;em up.

Chandler appeared in &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; for Fox. He then went over to Warner Bros. to make &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, which was his last film.

==Personal life==
Chandler married actress Marjorie Hoshelle in 1946. The couple had two daughters, Jamie Tucker (born 1947) and Dana Grossel (born 1949). They separated in 1951, again in 1954, and filed for divorce in 1954. His wife complained that Chandler was &quot;chronically fatigued so that he would fall asleep wherever we were.&quot; They reconciled in March 1955.

In 1957, he had an affair with Esther Williams while they made a movie together, and his wife filed for divorce at the end of the year.

In his 1958 divorce proceedings, Chandler was revealed to be paying his wife an allowance of $1,500 per month. He said he was under contract to Universal to make two films a year at $60,000 per film for 1957 and $75,000 per film for 1958. He said he earned $250,000 in 1957 from his acting and singing, but had a lot of expenses, with his personal manager, business manager, and agent taking 25% of his income. The court ordered Chandler to continue paying $1,500 per month. Their divorce was granted in June 1959, with Chandler giving his wife $100,000 and over $2,166 per month in alimony plus $500 per month in child support. &quot;He became so absorbed by his career that he spent all time when not actually working on a picture in his business office&quot;, said his wife. &quot;I developed an ulcer.&quot;

Chandler was involved in a will dispute concerning his stepfather in 1960.

Chandler was a cousin of actor David Roya, who played the young villain Bernard Posner in &quot;Billy Jack&quot;.

When his friend Sammy Davis Jr. lost an eye in an accident and was in danger of losing the other, Chandler offered to give Davis one of his own eyes. Chandler had nearly lost an eye and had been visibly scarred in an auto accident years earlier.

Chandler had a relationship with Gloria DeHaven that was exposed in &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine. At a trial, Fred Otash said the detectives had followed them to get the story.

Esther Williams wrote in her 1999 autobiography that she broke off their relationship after he proposed because Chandler revealed he was a cross dresser. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; many friends and colleagues of Chandler rejected her claims. Jane Russell commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing. Cross-dressing is the last thing I would expect of Jeff. He was a sweet guy, definitely all man.&quot;

He was also linked with Ann Sheridan.

Chandler&#x27;s public support for Israel&#x27;s 1956 attack on Egypt during the Suez Crisis prompted the United Arab Republic to campaign for his films to be banned in Arab countries in 1960. Chandler was an active Democrat.

He represented the Screen Actors Guild during talks throughout the 1960 actors&#x27; strike.

==Death==
While working on &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot; in the Philippines, on April 15, 1961, Chandler injured his back playing baseball with U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers who served as extras in the film. He had injections to deaden the pain and enable him to finish the production.

On May 13, 1961, he entered a hospital in Culver City, California, and had surgery for a spinal disc herniation. Severe complications arose; an artery was damaged, and Chandler hemorrhaged. On May 17, in a seven-and-a-half-hour emergency operation following the original surgery, he was given 55 pints of blood. A third operation followed on May 27, in which he received an additional 20 pints of blood. He died on June 17, 1961. The cause was a blood infection complicated by pneumonia.

At the time of his death, Chandler was involved with British actress Barbara Shelley. Tony Curtis and Gerald Mohr were among the pallbearers at Chandler&#x27;s funeral, attended by more than 1,500 people. He was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City.

An investigation into Chandler&#x27;s death determined it resulted from medical malpractice, and his children sued the hospital and the doctors involved for $1.5 million. The lawsuit was settled for $233,258. A joint statement was released in which all parties agreed that no fault was admitted by the hospital or doctors.

Chandler&#x27;s estate was worth $600,000, which he left to his daughters. His ex-wife sued his estate for $80,000 for money owed under their divorce settlement.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Chandler has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1770 Vine Street.

==Critical appraisal==
Film historian David Shipman wrote this analysis of Chandler&#x27;s image:

An obituary of Chandler said:
In a 1960 interview Chandler said his favorite films were &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Battle of Apache Pass&quot;, &quot;Two Flags West&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot; (&quot;my first real love story&quot;), &quot;Sign of the Pagan&quot;, &quot;The Toy Tiger&quot; (&quot;a change for me&quot;), &quot;Drango&quot;, &quot;Raw Wind in Eden&quot; (&quot;beautiful locale&quot;), and &quot;The Lady Takes a Flyer&quot; (&quot;I had Lana Turner with me&quot;).

The famed animated action-adventure series &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;&#x27;s handsome, white-haired, veteran special agent bodyguard Race Bannon&#x27;s design was modeled after Jeff Chandler by show creator Doug Wildey.

==Singing==
Chandler had a concurrent career as a singer and recording artist, releasing several albums and playing nightclubs. In 1955 he became only the second star to play at the Riviera, after Liberace was the featured headliner. In her autobiography &quot;Hold the Roses&quot; (2002), Rose Marie wrote that &quot;Jeff Chandler was a great guy, but he was no singer. He put together an act and we opened at the Riviera. He came with a conductor, piano player, light man, press agent, and manager. None of it helped, and everybody raved about Jeff&#x27;s singing, but let&#x27;s face it: He really didn&#x27;t sing very well. He definitely had guts to open in Vegas&quot;. He left to work on a movie after three and a half weeks.

A May 1955 review of a Chandler live performance in &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;it is in the realm of pure song&quot; that Chandler &quot;falters and shows weakness.&quot;

<text>Canning Dock on the River Mersey is part of the Port of Liverpool in northern England. The dock is in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock to the south and with access to the river via the Canning Half Tide Dock to the west. The Canning Graving Docks are accessed from the dock.

==History==

Canning Dock was opened in 1737 as the Dry Dock, a protected tidal basin providing an entrance to Old Dock. Having been subsequently enclosed as a wet dock three years earlier, in 1832 it was officially named after the Liverpool MP George Canning. To the east is the site of Old Dock, built in 1709, which was the world&#x27;s first enclosed commercial dock. Canning Dock would have initially served ships involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

Access to the northern half of the dock system was via George&#x27;s Dock, George&#x27;s Basin and into Prince&#x27;s Dock. George&#x27;s Basin was filled in 1874. George&#x27;s Dock was filled in 1899, and its site is now the Pier Head.

Along with the Albert Dock and others in the immediate vicinity, Canning Dock was abandoned as a commercial shipping facility in 1972 due to falling traffic and the rising cost of dredging.

===Graving docks ===

Adjoining the dock basin are two dry graving dock built by Henry Berry between 1765 and 1769. They were lengthened and deepened by Jesse Hartley in the 1840s. In the 1980s the graving docks became part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum and home to two of the museum&#x27;s ships, the pilot cutter &quot;Edmund Gardner&quot; and the schooner &quot;De Wadden&quot;.

==Redevelopment==
Canning Dock was restored from 1983, providing access to the Canning Graving Docks, which are part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum.

By March 2009 work was completed on a £22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further of navigable waterway.

From Princes Dock, the extension passes the Pier Head and terminates at Canning Dock. The extension includes a small canal basin at Mann Island near Pier Head, and a new lock providing access to Canning Dock.

<doc id="1136942" wikidata="Q1029425" url="?curid=1136942" title="Sniff 'n' the Tears">
<text>Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears are a British rock band best known for their 1978 song &quot;Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot;, a moderate hit in many countries (including No. 15 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) (in September 1979). The band is led by singer/songwriter Paul Roberts, the band&#x27;s sole constant member.

== Formation and initial success (1973–1979) ==
An early version of Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears had been gigging in England as early as 1974. They were unable to land a record deal and the band&#x27;s singer/songwriter Paul Roberts decided to dissolve the group and move to France.

A few years later, Luigi Salvoni, the drummer from a band called Moon, listened to some demos that he and Roberts had cut in about 1975 for a French record label. Hearing some potential in them, he contacted Roberts about approaching pub rock label, Chiswick Records for a deal. Roberts, who had been concentrating on his career as a painter, agreed and Salvoni recruited some of the musicians from the demos to record &quot;Fickle Heart&quot;, their debut album. When it became apparent that things were going well and that a band would be needed for live work and promotion, Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears subsequently debuted in 1978 as a six-piece band, consisting of Paul Roberts (vocals, acoustic guitar), Loz Netto (guitars), Mick Dyche (guitars), Chris Birkin (bass), Alan Fealdman (keyboards), and Luigi Salvoni (drums &amp; percussion). Both Salvoni and Netto had been in the band Moon, which issued two albums in the UK in 1975/76.

This line-up recorded the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fickle Heart&quot;, which was produced by Salvoni. Guesting on the album as a backing vocalist was Noel McCalla, who had been Moon&#x27;s lead singer.

Though recorded in 1978, the album sat unreleased for over a year because Chiswick were in the process of changing their distribution. The band then had a substantial international hit with &quot;Fickle Heart&quot;″s lead single &quot;Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot; in 1979, aided by its driving rhythm, catchy lyrics and a Moog solo contributed by guest musician Keith Miller. However, the band fractured almost immediately after the album&#x27;s release; in a matter of months, Birkin, Fealdman, and Salvoni all left the group to pursue other interests.

Nick South took over on bass and would become a permanent member of the band. On tour, Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears were augmented by drummer Paul Robinson and keyboardist Keith Miller.

When naming the 1973 band, Roberts suggested &quot;The Tears&quot;, but their manager suggested &quot;Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears&quot; because Roberts had hay fever and sniffed a lot.

== The 1980s ==
For the group&#x27;s second album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Game&#x27;s Up&quot;, the band&#x27;s line-up consisted of Roberts, Netto, Dyche, South, and new keyboard player Keith Miller. At this point the group had no permanent drummer, and a variety of session drummers were used.

&quot;The Game&#x27;s Up&quot; yielded no hits, and Netto left the group to establish a solo career, taking Dyche with him. This left Roberts as the sole remaining original member of Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; The Tears. He decided to press on, and recruited Les Davidson as the group&#x27;s new guitarist and added Jamie Lane as the permanent drummer. This five piece line-up (Roberts, Davidson, Lane, South and Taylor) recorded two albums: &quot;Love/Action&quot; (1981), and &quot;Ride Blue Divide&quot; (1982). Again no hits were spun off from these albums, and after the contract ended with Chiswick Records, the group broke up in 1983.

Singer and songwriter Paul Roberts went on to make two solo albums for Sonet Records: &quot;City Without Walls&quot; (1985) and &quot;Kettle Drum Blues&quot; (1987), while Loz Netto issued singles like &quot;Fade Away&quot; and &quot;We Touch&quot; (the latter song turning up in an episode of the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; television show).

== Reformation (1992–present) ==
After a decade of inactivity, Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; The Tears were unexpectedly revived in 1992, after the use of &quot;Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot; in a European advertising campaign pushed the 13-year-old recording to the very top of the Dutch chart in mid-1991. Roberts took the opportunity to assemble a new version of Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears, and took them out on the road in the Netherlands and Germany. This version of the band consisted of Roberts and Davidson, with new recruits Jeremy Meek (bass) (Ex Live Wire), Steve Jackson (drums) and Andy Giddings (keyboards). This line-up also cut a new studio album in 1992, &quot;No Damage Done&quot;, which was the first new Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears release in a decade.

&quot;Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot; was prominently featured on the soundtrack of the 1997 film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and had another popular resurgence as a result. The song also appeared in episode 10 of the second season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;18 Miles Out&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next release, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Underground&quot;, featured Roberts singing and playing almost everything. He was credited with vocals, guitars, mandolin, harmonica, keyboards, bass and drum programming. However, longtime group member Les Davidson also played guitar on the album, and new member Robin Langridge handled the bulk of keyboard parts.

After another long hiatus, the band released their seventh album, &quot;Downstream&quot;, in February 2011. The Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears line-up for this album consisted of Paul Roberts (vocals, guitars, bass, keyboard), Les Davidson (guitars), Robin Langridge (keyboards), returning member Nick South (bass) and new member Richard Marcangelo (drums). Marcangelo had previously been a session player on &quot;The Game&#x27;s Up&quot;. Jennifer Maidman, who had played bass on Paul Roberts&#x27; two solo albums, also played bass on several tracks.

A line-up of Roberts, Davidson, South, Langridge and new drummer Paul Robinson issued the album &quot;Random Elements&quot; in 2017. While Roberts remained the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, for this album Davidson and Langridge also received co-writing credits on a number of tracks. Robinson had not only played on &#x27;The Game&#x27;s Up&#x27; but had toured with the group as their drummer in the late 1970s; this marked his official entry into the group 37 years later.

In 2020, Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears (now consisting only of Roberts and Davidson) issued the album &quot;Jump&quot;, which consisted of new acoustic versions of a number of songs in the band&#x27;s catalogue (including &quot;Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot;).

<doc id="1136948" wikidata="Q1009561" url="?curid=1136948" title="Bunker Hill Monument">
<text>The Bunker Hill Monument is a monument erected at the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill in Boston, Massachusetts, which was among the first major battles between the United Colonies and the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War. The 221-foot (67 m) granite obelisk was erected between 1825 and 1843 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, with granite from nearby Quincy conveyed to the site via the purpose-built Granite Railway, followed by a trip by barge. There are 294 steps to the top.

An exhibit lodge built near the base of the monument in the late 19th century houses a statue of Joseph Warren. Bunker Hill is one of the sites along the Freedom Trail and is part of Boston National Historical Park.

The monument underwent a $3.7 million renovation, completed in 2007, that included repairs, handicap accessibility improvements, and new lighting. The Bunker Hill Museum across the street was dedicated in June of that year and includes many exhibits about the battle.

==Background==
The monument was one of the first in the United States. It is not on Bunker Hill, but instead on Breed&#x27;s Hill, where most of the fighting in the misnamed Battle of Bunker Hill actually took place. An earlier memorial at the site, an wooden column topped with a gilt urn, had been erected in memory of Joseph Warren, a Mason, in 1794 by King Solomon&#x27;s Lodge of Masons.

The Monument Association, which had purchased the entire battlefield site by 1825, was forced to sell off all but the summit of the hill in 1838 to cover the cost of completing the monument.

In front of the current obelisk is a statue of Col. William Prescott, a native of Groton, Massachusetts, who died during the battle. Some popular stories claim he coined the famous phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t fire until you see the whites of their eyes&quot; during this battle; others have instead attributed it to Israel Putnam, John Stark, or Richard Gridley, rather than Prescott; but the main consensus is that none of them said it. In any case, no one at Bunker Hill could have coined the phrase; the idea behind it was already more than a hundred years old when this battle took place, and the modern phrasing of it had been used by British commanders Sir Andrew Agnew in the 1740s and James Wolfe in the 1750s, as well as by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745, famously repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great.

==Breed&#x27;s Hill==
Breed&#x27;s Hill is a glacial drumlin located in the Charlestown section of Boston, Massachusetts. It is located in the southern portion of the Charlestown Peninsula, a historically oval, but now more roughly triangular, peninsula that was originally connected to the mainland portion of Charlestown (now the separate city of Somerville) in colonial times by a short, narrow isthmus known as the Charlestown Neck. It is best known as the location where in 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War, most of the fighting in the Battle of Bunker Hill took place. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the peninsula&#x27;s shape and connections to other landforms were significantly altered, with the waters of the Charles River between Cambridge and Charlestown heavily filled in. Much of the hill is now occupied by residential construction, but the summit area is the location of the Bunker Hill Monument and other memorials commemorating the battle.

The hill is about high, and is topped by Monument Square, site of the Bunker Hill Monument. The hill slopes fairly steeply to the east and west. In addition to its historic sites and tourist-oriented facilities, the hill is the site of a great deal of residential property, as well as supporting municipal and retail infrastructure. It is about from Bunker Hill.

==History==

The Americans, having caught word of a British plan to fortify the Charlestown peninsula, decided to get to the peninsula first, fortify it, and present sufficient threat to cause the British to leave Boston. On June 16, 1775, under the leadership of General Putnam and Colonel Prescott, the Americans stole out onto the Charlestown Peninsula with instructions to establish defensive positions on the hills overlooking Boston.

A redoubt, a small and usually temporary defensive fortification, was constructed on nearby Breed&#x27;s Hill, probably due to its closer proximity to Boston compared to Bunker Hill. The next morning, June 17, the British were astonished to see the rebel fortifications upon the hill and set out to reclaim the peninsula. The resulting conflict was called the Battle of Bunker Hill because that is where Prescott originally intended—and was ordered—to build the fortifications. Also, some people considered Breed&#x27;s Hill a part of Bunker Hill, while others called it Charlestown Hill.

British soldiers under Howe sent 2,400 men to attack Breed&#x27;s Hill. A force of 1,500 colonists held off two British Army attacks, but the third attack, by British Royal Marines, forced the rebels to retreat. 450 colonists were killed or wounded, compared to 1,150 British casualties.

In 1825, the Bunker Hill Monument Association began construction of the Bunker Hill Monument, acquiring of land for the purpose.

== Construction ==
William Ticknor, a well-known Boston lawyer and antiquarian, first suggested that a memorial be built. An interested group of men met for breakfast at the home of Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins, including William Tudor, Daniel Webster, Professor George Ticknor, Doctor John C. Warren, William Sullivan, and George Blake. On May 10, 1823, the first public meeting was called. Each member subscribed five dollars, and on June 7, 1823, the Bunker Hill Monument Association was established and the work of raising money was begun. Famed nineteenth-century philanthropist Amos Lawrence contributed $10,000 to the monument&#x27;s erection.
In the spring of 1825 the directors had purchased about on the slope of Breed&#x27;s Hill, but had not yet chosen a design. The first design committee consisted of Webster, noted engineer Loammi Baldwin Jr., George Ticknor, Gilbert Stuart, and Washington Allston. One hundred dollars was offered for the best design; about 50 plans were presented in response. Choice was soon narrowed to a column and an obelisk and a new committee was appointed to procure designs and estimate expenses for each. At the next meeting the majority voted that the obelisk designed by Solomon Willard be used.

The directors laid the cornerstone on June 17, 1825. The Marquis de Lafayette (who was on a 14-month tour of the United States on the 50th anniversary of the War) performed the ceremony, Webster delivered the oration, and the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, conducted the services. Rev. Joseph Thaxter, who was wounded in the battle, officiated as chaplain at the ceremony, offering a prayer in thanks for the colonists&#x27; victory. More than 100,000 attended the event, including 190 veterans who had participated in the battle.

Blocks of granite for the monument averaged each and were quarried by wedging. They were delivered to the site at an actual cost of $5.40 per cubic yard from a quarry opened for the purpose, far below the average contract offer of $24.30 for the same. Moving the blocks proceeded somewhat slowly at first, but the Granite Railway was completed in short order and became operational on October 7, 1826, the first commercial railroad in the United States functioning as a common carrier.

Construction of the monument was frequently halted as available funds were depleted. To bring the project to completion the Monument Association in 1838 began to sell off sections of the battlefield as house lots; they were successful in raising the money, while giving up about two thirds of the area (sale of ), preserving only the summit of Breed&#x27;s Hill as the monument grounds. Neighbors disgruntled with the construction eyesore were rumored to have plans to raise money to tear down the partially completed monument. Sarah Josepha Hale and the readers of her magazine supplied funds essential to the monument&#x27;s successful completion. The capstone was laid on July 23, 1842, and the monument was dedicated on June 17 of the following year, again with a Daniel Webster oration. According to the Boston Latin School Association&#x27;s &quot;Points of Pride Quiz&quot; for December 2007, BLS boys helped erect the Boston landmark.

The Bunker Hill Monument Association maintained the monument and grounds until 1919, when it was turned over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 1976 the monument was transferred to the National Park Service and became a unit of Boston National Historical Park. The monument was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, in part for its architectural significance as a major early war memorial, and the nation&#x27;s largest-scale memorial prior to the construction of the Washington Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and was included in the Monument Square Historic District in 1987.

Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem was published in her Scenes in my Native Land, 1845 together with a description of both the monument and the battle.

<text>Te Whanga Lagoon dominates the geography of Chatham Island, in the South Pacific Ocean off New Zealand&#x27;s east coast. It covers .

It is the outflow of several small rivers in the island&#x27;s hilly south, and drains to the Pacific via gaps in Hanson Bay on the east coast of the island.

It contains many fossilized shark teeth that can be collected from the edges of the lagoon. Over time the lagoon is likely to silt up.

When first described by Dr E Dieffenbach in 1841, the lagoon was only slightly brackish and separated from the sea by a low sand bar and was about above high tide.

<doc id="1136955" wikidata="Q5140876" url="?curid=1136955" title="Cofer Black">
<text>Joseph Cofer Black (born 1950) is an American former CIA officer who served as director of the Counterterrorism Center in the years surrounding the September 11th attacks, and was later appointed Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the State Department by President George W. Bush, serving until his resignation in 2004. Prior to his roles combatting terrorism, Black served across the globe in a variety of roles with the Directorate of Operations at the CIA.

==Early life==
A native of Ridgefield, Connecticut, Black completed his BA at the University of Southern California in 1973. The next year he earned a master&#x27;s degree in international relations, also at USC. He then was accepted to a doctoral program at USC, but left in 1975 to join the CIA.

==CIA career up to 1999==
At the CIA, Black trained for the clandestine service and volunteered for Africa based on his knowledge of the region from childhood travels with his father across the continent. Initially, he worked as a case officer in Lusaka, Zambia during the Rhodesian Bush War. He then transferred to Somalia, where he served for two years during the conflict between Ethiopians and Somalis. He worked in South Africa during the National Party government&#x27;s war against guerrilla movements opposing the apartheid system. While assigned to Kinshasa, Zaire, Black was involved in the Reagan Administration&#x27;s covert action program to arm anti-communist guerrillas in neighboring Angola.

In 1993, Black transferred from London to Khartoum, Sudan, where he served as CIA station chief until 1995. This was at a low point in U.S.-Sudanese relations, due to the latter&#x27;s sponsorship of terrorism and the harboring of Carlos the Jackal and Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Black oversaw the collection of human intelligence (HUMINT) on terrorist cells and support structures; toward the end of his tenure, he was targeted by Al Qaeda for assassination (see Woodward, &quot;Bush at War&quot;, p. 9). Black was also responsible for the collection of intelligence that led to the 1994 capture of the terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal.

In 1995, Black was named the Task Force Chief in the Near East and South Asia Division. From June 1998 through June 1999, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Latin America Division.

==Director of CTC (1999–2002)==
In June 1999 Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet named Black director of the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorist Center (CTC). In this capacity, Black served as the CIA Director&#x27;s Special Assistant for Counterterrorism as well as the National Intelligence Officer for Counterterrorism. Black&#x27;s promotion was a part of Tenet&#x27;s &quot;grand plan&quot; for dealing with Al Qaeda. Black was the operational chief in charge of this effort. Tenet also put &quot;Richard,&quot; one of his own assistants, in charge of the CTC&#x27;s bin Laden tracking unit. Black still headed the CTC at the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center.

===Al-Qaeda strategy, 1999–2001===
In December 1998, CIA chief Tenet &quot;declared war&quot; on Osama bin Laden. Early in 1999 Tenet &quot;ordered the CTC to begin a &#x27;baseline&#x27; review of the CIA&#x27;s operational strategy against bin Laden.&quot; In the spring, he &quot;demanded &#x27;a new, comprehensive plan of attack&#x27; against bin Laden and his allies.&quot;

The CTC had produced a &quot;comprehensive plan of attack&quot; against bin Laden and previewed the new strategy to senior CIA management by the end of July 1999. By mid-September, it had been briefed to CIA operational level personnel, the NSA, the FBI, and other partners. The strategy was referred to as &quot;the Plan.&quot;

... [Cofer] Black and his new bin Laden unit wanted to &quot;project&quot; into Afghanistan, to &quot;penetrate&quot; bin Laden&#x27;s sanctuaries. They described their plan as military officers might. They sought to surround Afghanistan with secure covert bases for CIA operations—as many bases as they could arrange. Then they would mount operations from each of the platforms, trying to move inside Afghanistan and as close to bin Laden as they could to recruit agents and to attempt capture operations. Black wanted recruitments and he wanted to develop commando or paramilitary strike teams made up of officers and men who could &quot;blend&quot; into the region&#x27;s Muslim populations.

Parallel with these developments, in November–December 1999, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Nawaf al-Hazmi visited Afghanistan, where they were selected for the &quot;planes operation&quot; that was to become known as 9/11. Working with a Malaysian security unit, the CIA watched al-Hazmi and his companion Khalid al-Mihdhar as they attended a January 2000 Al Qaeda conference in Kuala Lumpur, later determined to be where decisions about the &quot;planes operation&quot; were made.

According to an internal CIA report on the performance of the agency prior to the 9/11 attacks, Black was criticized for not informing the FBI that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar had subsequently entered the United States. In addition, the 9/11 Commission found that while Black testified before Congress&#x27;s Joint Inquiry into 9/11 that the FBI had access to information on the two hijackers, the 9/11 Commission found no such evidence of this.

The CIA increasingly concentrated its resources on counter-terrorism, so that resources for this particular activity increased sharply. Some of the Plan&#x27;s more modest aspirations were translated into action. Intelligence collection efforts on bin Laden and Al Qaeda increased significantly from 1999. &quot;By 9/11,&quot; said Tenet, &quot;a map would show that these collection programs and human [reporting] networks were in place in such numbers as to nearly cover Afghanistan.&quot;

During the summer of 2001, Tenet, Black, and one of Black&#x27;s top assistants—&quot;Rich B&quot; (i.e. &quot;Richard&quot;)—were active in conveying the dangers of Al Qaeda to the new Bush administration. At a meeting with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and others on July 10, 2001, &quot;Rich&quot; predicted a &quot;spectacular&quot; terrorist attack against US interests &quot;in the coming weeks or months&quot; ... &quot;Multiple and simultaneous attacks are possible.&quot; After the meeting, &quot;Rich and Cofer congratulated each other,&quot; feeling that at last the CIA had gotten the full attention of the administration. At an internal CIA update in late July, &quot;Rich&quot; dramatically predicted, &quot;They&#x27;re coming here!&quot; (i.e. the United States).

One of the ways by which CIA/CTC surveilled Osama bin Laden in his Afghan base was the Predator reconnaissance drone. A joint CIA-Air Force program of flights in autumn 2000 (dubbed &quot;Afghan Eyes&quot;) produced probable sightings of the Al Qaeda leader. Black became a &quot;vocal advocate&quot; of arming the aircraft with missiles to target bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders. Throughout 2001, Black and &quot;Richard&quot; continued to press for Predators armed with adapted Hellfire anti-tank missiles. Legal and technical issues delayed the program. Black urged Tenet to promote the matter at the long-awaited Cabinet-level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism of September 4, 2001. The CIA chief did so. The CIA was authorized to &quot;deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft.&quot;

===September 11, 2001===
After the attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, some CTC staff refused an order to evacuate the CIA headquarters at Langley. This included the shift of the Global Response Center on the exposed sixth floor, which Black would eventually argue had &quot;a key function in a crisis like this.&quot; CIA Director Tenet finally accepted that Black wouldn&#x27;t leave, and that their lives would be put at risk.

The CTC obtained passenger lists from the planes that had been turned into weapons that morning, noting the presence of Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. This was the first &quot;absolute proof&quot; that the attacks were an Al Qaeda plot. The CTC had first come across the names in connection with potential terrorist activity in the winter of 1999–2000 (see above).

=== Post 9/11: Global War on Terror ===
On September 13, 2001, Black briefed President George W. Bush in the White House Situation Room and outlined a CIA-led campaign in Afghanistan in which small teams of CIA officers and Green Berets would work with the Northern Alliance to topple the Taliban government and expel Al Qaeda. Black told Bush: &quot;When we&#x27;re through with them, they will have flies walking across their eyeballs.&quot; Black told Bush that the CIA&#x27;s planning efforts had put them in a better position to respond after the attacks. Tenet later said,

How could [an intelligence] community without a strategic plan tell the president of the United States just four days after 9/11 how to attack the Afghan sanctuary and operate against al-Qa&#x27;ida in ninety-two countries around the world?

A &quot;war council&quot; (i.e. a restricted group of the National Security Council) chaired by President Bush at Camp David was convened on September 15, 2001. Black was present. Tenet proposed first to send CIA teams into Afghanistan to collect intelligence and mount covert operations. The teams would act jointly with military Special Operations units. President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been &quot;a turning point in his thinking.&quot;

Black and Armitage then flew to Moscow to seek help from Russian diplomatic and intelligence officers, as Afghanistan was in their sphere of influence. The Russians indicated their willingness to help and would not obstruct CIA activities. They warned Black about guerilla fighters being a major problem for the Russian army in Afghanistan, and provided a team to the CIA to assist with extensive on-the-ground intelligence, especially about topography and caves.

The CIA geared up to take the lead in the attack on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team, led by Gary Schroen, entered the country on September 26, 2001. A new branch was added to the CTC—CTC Special Operations, or CTC/SO. Hank Crumpton, the former head of CTC operations, was recalled to head it. Black told him, &quot;Your mission is to find al-Qa&#x27;ida, engage it, and destroy it.&quot;

Testifying at the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the September 11 attacks in 2002, Black declined the offer of anonymity because &quot;I want to look the American people in the eye.&quot;

During the &quot;war on terror&quot; Black is said to have played a &quot;leading role in many of the [CIA]&#x27;s more controversial programs, including the rendition/kidnapping and torture /interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects and the detention of some of them in secret prisons [outside the USA].&quot; A small group of officials within the CIA&#x27;s Counter-terrorism Center was put in charge of supporting the prisons and managing the interrogations. By some accounts, Abu Zubaydah was taken into custody in March 2002 in Pakistan, and after initial U.S. interrogation and treatment for gunshot wounds, sent to a secret CIA torture center in Thailand, where he was waterboarded in April or May 2002.

==Coordinator for Counter-terrorism (2002–2004)==
Black was appointed as the US Department of State&#x27;s Ambassador-at-Large for counter-terrorism in late 2002. He held this position until November 2004.

==Private sector work (2005–present)==
=== Blackwater ===
From 2005 to 2008, Black was Vice Chairman of Blackwater USA (later renamed Blackwater Worldwide, then Xe, and finally Academi), a US-based private military contractor which was &quot;the biggest of the State Department&#x27;s three private security contractors&quot;.

In March 2006, Black allegedly suggested at an international conference in Amman, Jordan, that Blackwater USA was ready to move towards providing security professionals up to brigade size for humanitarian efforts and low intensity conflicts. Black denies the allegation. Critics have suggested this may be going too far in putting political decisions in the hands of privately owned corporations. The company denies this was ever said.

Black resigned in 2008 reportedly after learning of illegal payments to Iraqi officials.

=== Blackbird Technologies &amp; Total Intelligence Solutions ===
From 2009 to 2014, Black joined Blackbird Technologies as Vice President for Global Operations. Blackbird was a technology contractor to intelligence, defense and corporate clients, before being acquired by Raytheon in 2014. Black later served as chairman of Total Intelligence Solutions (Total Intel), a private intelligence gathering group. This company was created in February 2007 by the Prince Group, the holding company that owns Blackwater. Total Intel was formed by the merger of The Black Group LLC (also led by Black), Terrorism Research Center, Inc., and Technical Defense. As of 2021, Total Intel has been absorbed by OODA group, a business intelligence and crisis response consulting group. Black appears on the firm&#x27;s list of consultants.

=== Mitt Romney presidential campaigns ===
On April 26, 2007, Black was chosen by Mitt Romney to head a campaign counter-terrorism policy advisory group during the Republican&#x27;s 2008 U.S. presidential campaign.

In October 2011, Black was chosen by Romney to serve as &quot;Special Adviser&quot; on all foreign policy issues during his 2012 presidential campaign.

=== Burisma ===
In February 2017, the Ukrainian oil and gas corporation Burisma announced the addition of Black to the company&#x27;s board of directors, leading the company&#x27;s security and strategic development efforts.

In the wake of the Hunter Biden email controversy, a report from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; associated Black&#x27;s role at the firm with a group of &quot;well-connected operatives in Washington to help persuade Ukrainian prosecutors to drop criminal cases against it.&quot;

During the 2020 presidential election, the Trump campaign shared an article from a conservative opinion outlet advancing a conspiracy theory connecting Black&#x27;s work with Burisma and his connection to Mitt Romney&#x27;s presidential campaigns. The campaign used the article to attempt to tie Romney to the growing Hunter Biden email controversy and discredit his vote to convict Trump during his first impeachment trial as a product of corrupt collusion with the Bidens. Romney associates contradicted the claims.

=== Mueller investigation ===
Black&#x27;s name appears in volume five of the 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections produced following the investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Joel Zamel, executive at Psy-Group, an Israeli private intelligence agency specializing in honey traps and perception manipulation campaigns, testified that apart from their pitch to the Trump campaign, the firm had proposed projects to three other clients: Russian oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Dmitri Rybolovlev, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, whom Black had introduced to Zamel in 2016.

=== Other roles ===
In January 2016 Black became an independent director of publicly traded biotechnology company Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO), a Maryland-based development-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cancer immunotherapies.

==Awards==

In addition to numerous exceptional performance awards and meritorious citations, Ambassador Black received the Distinguished Intelligence Medal; the CIAs highest achievement award, the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the George HW Bush Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism, the Donavan award, and the Exceptional Collector Award.

<doc id="1136958" wikidata="Q7987723" url="?curid=1136958" title="Western College Program">
<text>The Western College Program was created in 1974 when the Western College for Women merged with Miami University. The program consisted of an interdisciplinary living/learning community with small class sizes and student-designed focuses. Majors included Interdisciplinary Studies, Environmental Science, and Environmental Studies. Academics were divided into three core areas: Creativity and Culture, Social Systems, and Natural Systems.

Western, also known as the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, was cited as a primary reason for Miami University making the list of &quot;Public Ivies&quot; in Richard Moll&#x27;s book, &quot;The Public Ivies: A Guide to America&#x27;s Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities&quot;. In the mid-1960s, when it was the Western College for Women, the campus served as the staging ground for Freedom Summer, a voter registration drive in Mississippi.

==The Western campus==
Located directly east of the main campus of Miami University, Western College is characterized by winding pathways through forest and stone bridges over creeks. Peabody Hall, currently a coed dormitory, is said to be haunted by its namesake Helen Peabody. Other buildings on Western Campus include McKee Hall, Mary Lyon Hall, Kumler Chapel, Western Lodge, Ernst Theater, Western Tower, Ice House, Summer House, Sawyer Hall (former gymnasium, heating plant, pool and dining hall), Boyd Hall, Hoyt Hall, the Art Museum, and non-WCP buildings, Clawson Hall, Alexander Dining Hall, Presser Hall, Langstroth Cottage, Havighurst Hall, and Thomson Hall.

==Merger with College of Arts and Sciences==
In March 2006, Miami University Provost Jeffrey Herbst recommended to Miami University President Dr. James C. Garland that the Western College Program be phased out in favor of expanding Miami&#x27;s Honors Program. The proposal called for the creation of the Western Honors College. This proposal met with resistance from Western faculty, students and alumnae.

On June 23, 2006, The board of trustees voted to eliminate the School of Interdisciplinary Studies in favor of a &quot;Western Honors College&quot; in an attempt to expand the honors program at Miami.

On October 24, 2006, the University Senate began deliberations on the persistence of the program (without the &quot;school&quot; classification).

In January 2007, it was announced that the Western College Program would be merged into the College of Arts and Sciences. The Western College Program became the Western Program, Department of Individualized Studies. Rather than having a department of permanent faculty, the program would have one central faculty member with students taking classes led by faculty in several different departments. Students now receive a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree rather than the Bachelor of Philosophy its graduates were awarded in the Western College Program. Critics say the program may provide diverse courses with faculty from different backgrounds but the student-faculty bond which was a strongly beneficial attribute of Western&#x27;s previous incarnation may suffer. However, such concerns have turned out to be largely unfounded. The alleged plan to rid Western of permanent faculty never came to pass. After the transition, many Western College Program faculty remained as full-time faculty members for the Western Program.

<doc id="1136959" wikidata="Q1324723" url="?curid=1136959" title="GAM (group)">
<text>was a Japanese pop unit under the Hello! Project umbrella consisting of Aya Matsuura and former Morning Musume member Miki Fujimoto. This pairing was announced mid-June 2006. Previously, Matsuura and Fujimoto worked together in the one-off group Gomattou with Maki Goto.

According to Hello! Project producer Tsunku, the term GAM stands for &quot;Great Aya and Miki.&quot; After GAM&#x27;s debut, Tsunku decided to keep the group permanent instead of a one-time deal. However, with Fujimoto and Matsuura graduating from Hello! Project in March 2009, the group subsequently disbanded.

== History ==
On September 13, 2006, their first single, &quot;Thanks!,&quot; was released in Japan and made its debut at number two on the Oricon Daily Ranking chart. The single made its debut (and also peaked) the following week at number five in the Oricon Weekly Ranking chart and stayed in the top 200 for five weeks.

Their second single, , was released October 18, 2006, making its debut at number five on the Oricon Daily Ranking chart the same day. The Ninki weekly singles chart ranked &quot;Melodies&quot; as the fourth most anticipated new release of the week. On the Japanese version of the iTunes Store, the PV for the song was ranked number one on the Top Music Videos list, presumably ranked by sales, by November 3, 2006. &quot;Melodies&quot; features a more mature theme and contains several scenes implying an almost-sexual relationship between the two singers, such as the near-kiss sequence featured in the televised form of the PV; just as the two of them are about to kiss, the video comes to an abrupt end. The complete version of the PV released on the DVD showed that the two singers had actually kissed at the end of the video. Due to this, they were compared to the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. and dubbed among some listeners as the &quot;Japanese t.A.T.u.&quot;

Additionally, on the evening of the 28th of an uncertain month, Matsuura officially revealed her desire to go on a tour as part of GAM. Though her partner agreed, Fujimoto commented on how the group would need to record more original songs in order to do such a thing. Eventually, both members requested an album from producer Tsunku.

Their third single, Lu Lu Lu, was released on March 21, 2007. Three days later, &quot;Daisuki Rakuten Eagles&quot; was released as a theme song for the baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, the third Hello! Project song to do so.

<doc id="1136960" wikidata="Q596613" url="?curid=1136960" title="Exit strategy">
<text>An exit strategy is a means of leaving one&#x27;s current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure. An organisation or individual without an exit strategy may be in a . At worst, an exit strategy will save face; at best, an exit strategy will deliver an objective worth more than the cost of continuing the execution of a previous plan considered &quot;deemed to fail&quot; by weight of the present situation.

==In warfare==
In military strategy, an exit strategy is understood to minimise losses of what military jargon called &quot;blood and treasure&quot; (lives and materiel).

The term was used technically in internal Pentagon critiques of the Vietnam War (cf. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s promise of Peace With Honor), but remained obscure to the general public until the Battle of Mogadishu, Somalia when the U.S. military involvement in that U.N. peacekeeping operation cost the lives of U.S. troops without a clear objective. Republican critics of President Bill Clinton derided him for having no exit strategy, although he had inherited an active military operation from his predecessor, President George H. W. Bush. The criticism was revived later against the U.S. involvement in the Yugoslav wars, including peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and the Kosovo war against Serbia.

The term has been adopted by critics of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and especially Iraq. President George W. Bush was said to have no exit strategy to remove troops from Iraq, and critics worried about the number of Coalition soldiers and Iraqi civilians who would suffer injury or death as a result. President Barack Obama did not publicly announce an exit strategy for the troops in Afghanistan.

==In public policy==
An exit strategy may operate as a means of implementing the termination of a policy or to demonstrate that termination is feasible, for example from joining the Euro.

==In business==

In entrepreneurship and strategic management an &quot;exit strategy&quot; or &quot;exit plan&quot; is a way to transition the ownership of a company to another company (e.g. through a merger or acquisition), to investors (e.g. through an initial public offering) or to the owner&#x27;s children or family. Other types of exit strategies include management buyouts and employee buyouts. Winding up a company, whether through a bankruptcy or voluntary dissolution, is also an exit strategy. Bringing on board strategic or financial partners may be considered a form of exit, albeit a partial exit, as it may help ensure succession and survival of the business.

Exit strategies are also used to ensure businesses are prepared for the termination of significant contracts or other business relationships. &quot;There are many reasons why contracts come to an end, including non-performance by one or both parties, a significant change in the requirements of either party, or that the contract has run its course. In almost all cases, having a well-developed exit strategy is critical. The strategy is usually developed as the means by which to withdraw from a working relationship with a supplier. It can incorporate the process of returning assets, transferring back key employees and the conditions under which a relationship can terminate, for example, the failure to meet service level agreements, changes in circumstances, and ethical breaches&quot;.

Transition companies are professional mergers and acquisitions companies that assist business owners with their exit strategy. Services offered are often referred to as transition management services.

<doc id="1136961" wikidata="Q791642" url="?curid=1136961" title="Awatere River">
<text>The Awatere River is a large river flowing through Marlborough, New Zealand. Flowing along the trace of the active Awatere Fault, it runs northeast through a straight valley to the west of the Inland Kaikōura mountains. This valley is parallel with that of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River, to the south.

It flows for from its source in the mountainous interior to reach Cook Strait close to the town of Seddon.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;swift river&quot; for &quot;Awatere&quot; in Māori.

==Demographics==
The Awatere River valley, which corresponds to the statistical area of Awatere, covers , and includes the settlements of Seddon and Ward. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Awatere had a population of 1,617 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 9 people (−0.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 9 people (0.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 594 households, comprising 855 males and 759 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.13 males per female. The median age was 42.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 324 people (20.0%) aged under 15 years, 222 (13.7%) aged 15 to 29, 822 (50.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 246 (15.2%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.8% European/Pākehā, 13.2% Māori, 4.6% Pasifika, 1.9% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 13.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 51.6% had no religion, 37.7% were Christian, 0.2% were Muslim and 1.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 174 (13.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 249 (19.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $34,700, compared with $31,800 nationally. 177 people (13.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 795 (61.5%) people were employed full-time, 231 (17.9%) were part-time, and 21 (1.6%) were unemployed.

==Awatere River bridges==

In 1887 the Awatere River was without any bridge crossing and at the time was noted by Parliament to be the only river not bridged between Picton and Bluff. Planning of a 325-metre joint road and rail bridge began in 1896, designed by Peter Seton Hay, and construction by Scott Brothers Ltd, a Christchurch based company, began two years after. Back in those times, bridge building lacked the modern engineering technology that is used today, and much of the construction was done via human and animal power. The laying of caissons which formed the foundations of the bridge was notoriously treacherous to workers at the risk of developing the bends due to long exposure of working in pressurised conditions. Construction was completed on 18 July 1901. The original road/rail bridge was opened on 10 October 1902. Construction took three years at the cost of £22,500. A further £118 was spent to add a wind break to protect trains.

State Highway 1 crosses the Awatere River at its current point just north of Seddon. The initial bridge remained the crossing until 2007 when most recently traffic signals were added to either direction to control vehicles on the platform, which was only wide enough for one lane of traffic. A new $15 million two-lane road bridge was constructed with the railway being the sole use of the original bridge. The new road bridge opened to traffic in December 2008 and was officially opened on 31 January 2009. The vehicle deck on the original bridge was then decommissioned as it was deemed too expensive to retain its use for pedestrians and cyclists. 

However, the former single-lane vehicle deck below the rail deck was restored and re-opened for cyclists and walkers in December 2023, as part of the Whale Trail, a long-distance trail under construction between Picton and Kaikōura.

<text>Brick by Brick is the ninth studio album by American singer Iggy Pop, released in June 1990 by Virgin Records.

== Production and content ==

After attracting mixed reviews for much of his 1980s output, Pop hired producer Don Was, who was a longtime fan of Pop&#x27;s band the Stooges, as producer and opted for a hard rock sound. Many songs on the album incorporate a lyrical theme of the United States facing dangers of cultural decay and implosion. Slash and Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses fame were featured on the album as songwriters and performers. The cover was drawn by American cartoonist Charles Burns. The album&#x27;s personnel includes studio musicians Waddy Wachtel and Kenny Aronoff. The album is the first studio album that features Pop contributing guitar. He plays a majority of the guitar parts along with Wachtel and Slash. Was would go on to produce Pop&#x27;s album &quot;Avenue B&quot; (1999).

== Release ==

The album peaked at number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed on the charts for 37 weeks. The song &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge of the Night&quot; was released before the album as a soundtrack for the hit movie &quot;Black Rain&quot; starring Michael Douglas and Andy García. The song reached number 16 on Modern Rock Tracks. &quot;Candy&quot; reached number 30 on Mainstream Rock Tracks, number 5 on Modern Rock Tracks and number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The first single from the album, &quot;Home&quot;, reached number 2 on Modern Rock Tracks.

== Reception ==
The album gave Pop some of his strongest reviews since his David Bowie collaborations, and &quot;Candy&quot;, with the B-52&#x27;s vocalist Kate Pierson, became his first MTV hit. The video for the song found fairly heavy rotation on that station. Videos were also made for &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Butt Town&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge of the Night&quot;.

&quot;Butt Town&quot; received high praise from the MTV animated duo Beavis and Butt-Head; the latter stated, &quot;This song has the best lyrics I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;

<doc id="1136974" wikidata="Q799600" url="?curid=1136974" title="Badminton, Gloucestershire">
<text>Badminton is a village and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England. The only settlement in the parish is Badminton village, sometimes called Great Badminton to distinguish it from the hamlet of Little Badminton, about one mile to the north in Hawkesbury parish. The large country house called Badminton House is close to the north end of the village, and its surrounding deer park lies to the north and west.

==History==
The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a manor at &quot;Madmintune&quot; with 24 households. In 1612 Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, bought from Nicholas Boteler his manors of Great and Little Badminton. One century earlier the name &quot;Badimyncgtun&quot; was recorded, held by that family since 1275.

==Badminton House==
The village houses the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s residence, Badminton House, which has been the principal seat of the Somerset family since the late 17th century. Badminton House also gives its name to the sport of badminton.

==Amenities==
The village has a small shop which also serves as a post office. The nearest pub, the Fox and Hounds, is in the nearby village of Acton Turville.

The village is close to the A46 and A433 roads, and the B4040 passes south of it. The M4 motorway can be reached via the A46. The railway station in Acton Turville closed in 1968, but the line is still active. The nearest railway station is Yate on the Bristol–Gloucester line. West of the village is Badminton Airfield.

Badminton Horse Trials are held in early May each year in the parkland of Badminton House.

Badminton Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in the late 1890s or early 1900s. The club closed in 1914.

==Parish church==

The parish church of St Michael and All Angels is attached to the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s residence. The current church was built in 1785 and serves as the principal burial place of the Somerset family. Nearly all Dukes and Duchesses are interred here.

==Notable events==
Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War and later commander of all the British forces in the Crimean War was born, raised and buried in Badminton. He was the youngest son of the 5th Duke of Beaufort.

During the Second World War, Queen Mary left Marlborough House in London to take up residence at Badminton House, staying for the duration of the war. She lived there with her niece Mary, Duchess of Beaufort, wife of the 10th Duke.

Schenck was appointed midshipman in the United States Navy in 1825, and later promoted to lieutenant. During the Mexican–American War, he served under Commodore Stockton in the Conquest of California. In 1846, Schenck planted American victory flags at Santa Barbara, San Pedro and Pueblo de Los Angeles, claiming the areas as United States territory.

In 1862, Schenck was given command of in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Schenck also commanded and the 3rd Division of Admiral David Dixon Porter&#x27;s fleet in operations against Fort Fisher, and was mentioned for gallantry in Admiral Porter&#x27;s action report. He was later promoted to rear admiral on September 21, 1868, and retired on June 11, 1869.

Rear Admiral Schenck died at Dayton, Ohio, and is interred in the Woodland Cemetery in Dayton.

<text>Six ships of the United States Navy have borne the name USS &quot;Powhatan or USNS &quot;Powhatan, named in honor of Powhatan (1550–1618), an Indian chief in tidewater Virginia; the father of Pocahontas.

* , first ship of the name, was a sidewheel steam frigate, launched in 1850 and scrapped in 1887.
* USS &quot;Powhatan&quot;, second ship of the name, was a sidewheel gunboat transferred by the War Department to the Navy on 21 April 1861 and renamed on 4 November 1861.
* , third ship of the name, was a tugboat purchased in 1898. Her name was changed to in 1917; she was scrapped in 1928.
* , originally &quot;Hamburg&quot;, was built in 1899. Fourth ship of the name, she was commissioned as a troop transport and renamed &quot;Powhatan&quot; in 1917. She decommissioned in 1919 and was turned over to the Army Transport Service.
* , fifth ship of the name, was a tugboat launched in 1938. She was reclassified YTM-128 in 1944. She was active until 1970, sold for scrap in 1976, and was subsequently lost while under tow by to a scrapper in the Carolinas.
* , sixth ship of the name, was a fleet ocean tug operated by the Military Sealift Command to provide the U.S. Navy with towing service which entered service on 15 June 1979 and left service on 26 February 1999. As of May 2008, ex-&quot;Powhatan&quot; was stricken from the Military Sealift Command and leased to a private towing and salvage company for 10 years. At the recent completion of that lease, the U.S. Navy transferred the vessel to the Turkish Navy. Due to the poor condition of the vessel upon termination of the lease, BAV has overseen the refit of the vessel to include completely rebuilding of all engines and generators. Located in a shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina, the ex-&quot;Powhatan&quot; was re-commissioned into the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Inebolu&quot; recently after being completely prepped and repainted. As engine rebuilds near completion, preparations are being made for dock trials, sea trials, and then the long trek home to Turkey.</text><links>

<doc id="1136989" wikidata="Q7627452" url="?curid=1136989" title="Stuck in Wonderamaland">
<text>Stuck in Wonderamaland is the third album by the American band Dramarama, released in 1989. &quot;I Wish I Was Your Mother&quot; is a cover of the Mott the Hoople song. The band supported the album with a North American tour. &quot;Last Cigarette&quot; was a minor rock radio hit.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called the album &quot;guitar-driven rock (featuring a tastefully balanced acoustic/electric blend) that owes no small debt to the early work of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; deemed it &quot;one of the most intense, moving rock albums of the last year,&quot; writing that &quot;the twin guitars of Mr. E Boy and Peter Wood and the rhythm section of Chris Carter (bass) and Jesse (drums) play with fire, turning [John] Easdale&#x27;s existential lyrics into music that is both dreamlike and passionate.&quot;

<doc id="1136991" wikidata="Q17146064" url="?curid=1136991" title="Filing (law)">
<text>In law, filing is the delivery of a document to the clerk of a court and the acceptance of the document by the clerk for placement into the official record. If a document is delivered to the clerk and is temporarily placed or deposited with the court (but is not accepted for filing), it is said to have been lodged with or received by the court (but not filed). Courts will not consider motions unless an appropriate memorandum or brief is filed before the appropriate deadline. Usually a filing fee is paid which is part of court costs.

==Filing systems==
In civil procedure systems, filing rules can be mandatory or permissive. In a mandatory filing system, &quot;all&quot; documents of legal importance exchanged between the parties must also be concurrently filed with the court, while in a permissive filing system, &quot;nothing&quot; needs to be filed until the case reaches a point where direct judicial management is absolutely necessary (such as the brink of trial).

For example, the United States federal courts operate on a mandatory filing system (with minor exceptions for the most routine discovery exchanges). In contrast, from the reign of Edward IV during the late 1400s to the late 1990s (that is, before the 1998 promulgation of the Civil Procedure Rules), the trial courts of England and Wales normally did not maintain comprehensive pretrial case files (beyond recording the issuance of a writ to initiate a legal proceeding). Instead, after service of a writ, the parties merely served their pleadings on each other, then at some point in time, one party would ask the court to set down the case for trial (that is, put the case on a list of cases awaiting the setting or &quot;fixture&quot; of trial dates) and lodge two copies of the pleadings with the court (along with other documents relevant to the planned trial). Even after they had been lodged (i.e., temporarily deposited) with the court, the pleadings were not filed immediately. Rather, one copy was for the personal use of the judge, while the other copy would be officially filed &quot;after&quot; the trial together with the judgment to establish the court&#x27;s permanent record of the issues that had been formally adjudicated at trial. 

In the United States, a permissive filing system has persisted to the present in the state of New York, which was modified in 1992 but still largely operates in its traditional form in certain lower courts.

Filing may also refer to submission of a form to a government agency, with or without an accompanying fee.

==Filing methods==
Filing traditionally has been performed by visiting a clerk at a filing window, paying a filing fee by cash, check, or credit card, and submitting the document to be filed in duplicate or even triplicate. For each document filed, the court clerk inspects the document to ensure compliance with the court&#x27;s rules on how legal documents should be formatted, verifies that the filer has not been declared a vexatious litigant, and confirms that the case number and caption are for a valid case. 

Next, the court clerk then stamps both copies with a large stamp that indicates the name of the court and the date the document was filed, then keeps one copy for the court&#x27;s files and returns one copy to the filer for the filer&#x27;s own records. In certain jurisdictions, the clerk will stamp duplicate copies returned to the filer as &quot;file-conformed&quot; or &quot;conformed copy&quot; rather than &quot;filed&quot;. These stamps mean the duplicate copy appears to conform to the appearance of the original document, and in turn, a copy bearing such a stamp can be submitted with later filings as evidence of the earlier act of filing. But the &quot;filed&quot; stamp is reserved for the original document that goes into the court file, and will be seen outside that file only if one obtains a certified copy photocopied directly from the original document on file. 

In courts that require triplicate submissions, the third copy is then taken (either by the clerk or by the filer) to the chambers or courtroom of the judge assigned to the case. The clerk then adds the document to the docket for the case as well as any related deadlines or events.

If the document is the first pleading filed in a case (usually the complaint), the court clerk also assigns a new case number and opens a new file for the case.

A newer phenomenon is electronic filing, in which lawyers simply upload Portable Document Format electronic documents to a secure website maintained either by the court (for example, the U.S. has CM/ECF) or by a private commercial service like LexisNexis. This is convenient in that many courts can now accept filings at all hours, rather than only during regular business hours. Where e-filing is in effect, the filer is normally required to lodge a &quot;courtesy copy&quot; (that is, a conventional paper copy) at the chambers of the assigned judge by the next business day. The courtesy copy of the filing is merely used to decide the motion at issue and is discarded when no longer needed, since the electronic file is now the court&#x27;s master copy of the case file.

==Filing fees==
Generally, filing fees are controversial because some individuals believe that they impede access to justice. Although American litigants complain about fees all the time (for example, it costs $435 to file a complaint in Los Angeles), the American system is considered to be quite plaintiff-friendly by experts on comparative law. 

Many legal systems have filing fees for complaints that are &quot;proportional&quot; to the amount sought. Thus, the greater the damages sought, the higher the fee to file.

Even when one seeks a waiver for grossly unfair fees, courts tend to waive only the amount in excess of the plaintiff&#x27;s total assets, with the result that just to initiate a meritorious case, an already severely injured or damaged plaintiff may have to go bankrupt. What some consider to be the inherent unfairness of this system as actually implemented in Austria resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision, &quot;Republic of Austria v. Altmann&quot; (2004).

<doc id="1136992" wikidata="Q6835502" url="?curid=1136992" title="Michael Z. Williamson">
<text>Michael Z. Williamson (born 1967) is an American military science fiction and military fiction author best known for his libertarian-themed &quot;Freehold&quot; series published by Baen Books. Between 2004 and 2016, Williamson published eight &quot;Freehold&quot; novels, exploring military and political themes as well as first contact with alien beings. This was followed by the &quot;Forged in Blood&quot; (2017) and &quot;Freehold: Resistance&quot; (2019) anthologies, consisting of short stories taking place in the &quot;Freehold&quot; universe, some by Williamson and some by other authors, including Larry Correia, Tony Daniel, Tom Kratman and Brad R. Torgersen.

Work outside the &quot;Freehold&quot; universe includes &quot;The Hero&quot; (2004), written with John Ringo, and the time travel story &quot;A Long Time Until Now&quot; (2014). Short fiction by Williamson includes the story &quot;Soft Casualty&quot;, an exploration of psychological warfare which won a readers&#x27; choice award organized by Baen Books. Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Wisdom From My Internet&quot;, a collection of witticisms and political polemic from the Internet, was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2015, as part of the Sad Puppies campaign.

As of 2016, Williamson&#x27;s books had sold half a million copies.

==Biography==
Williamson was born in 1967 in Birkenhead, England. His family moved to Canada, then to Newark, Ohio, where he graduated from Newark High School in 1985. After high school, he joined the military and served in a support role in the Air Force for 5 years, then in the Air and Army National Guard, for a total of 22 years. Williamson&#x27;s military career included service with the United States Air Force in deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Williamson has three children and is married.

==Freehold books==

Williamson&#x27;s first book, &quot;Freehold&quot;, was released in January 2004 and made #3 on the April 2004 &quot;Locus&quot; Bestsellers list for science-fiction and fantasy paperbacks. 
&quot;Freehold&quot; tells the story of Kendra Pacelli, a young soldier who begins the book in the service of a world-dominant, authoritarian United Nations. Accused of a crime she did not commit, she flees Earth for the Freehold of Grainne where she struggles to adapt to the climate and culture of an ultra-libertarian planet. She eventually joins the Freehold military and fights in a war against a UN invasion. 
Williamson has remarked that the main character is partially based on himself and his experience immigrating from the UK to Canada and the United States.

Don D&#x27;Ammassa criticized &quot;Freehold&quot; as a political tract with an oversimplified and unrealistic view of humanity calling it a &quot;very long but frankly not very entertaining diatribe&quot;. Michael M. Jones of &quot;SF Site&quot; conversely called Williamson&#x27;s portrayal of a libertarian society &quot;sound and believable&quot; and described the book as &quot;a satisfactory debut&quot;. Ginger Armstrong of &quot;Kliatt&quot; called &quot;Freehold&quot; a &quot;highly readable SF adventure&quot; with &quot;a strong female protagonist&quot;. Carolyn Cushman of &quot;Locus&quot; noted heavy emphasis on the exposition of Libertarian ideology with plotting and pacing taking a back seat but described the novel as &quot;amazingly entertaining&quot;.

Many of Williamson&#x27;s other works are set in the universe established in &quot;Freehold&quot;. One is &quot;Contact with Chaos&quot; (2009) where humanity has first contact with alien beings. This becomes a further source of conflict between the United Nations and the Freeholders. In a review of the book, Joseph T. Major praised Williamson for refraining from heavy-handed political messages and instead creating &quot;a diverse, varied human interplanetary society ... trying to understand an exotic, alternative nonhuman society&quot;. Other novels set in the &quot;Freehold&quot; universe include &quot;Better to Beg Forgiveness...&quot; (2007) which Mark Lardas of the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; praised as
an &quot;exciting and violent adventure&quot; and &quot;Rogue&quot; (2011) which he described as Williamson setting &quot;a new, higher standard for himself&quot;. The novel &quot;Do Unto Others&quot; (2010) made the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; best-seller list in hardcover science fiction and &quot;Angeleyes&quot; (2016) sold in more than 100,000 copies.

Williamson was the editor of &quot;Forged in Blood&quot;, which was released in September 2017. The book is set in Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Freehold&quot; universe and he also wrote or co-wrote five of its 16 stories; other contributors included Larry Correia, Tony Daniel, and Tom Kratman. The stories are linked as they trace the history of a single sword, from its forging in Japan in the third century BC through to Williamson&#x27;s Freehold of Grainne in the 24th century. Mark Lardas praised the authors for creating a coherent anthology while attempting &quot;something original [by] telling a story through an object.&quot; He described the result as an &quot;engaging book&quot;. The science fiction review magazine &quot;Tangent&quot; described the work as a celebration of &quot;soldiers and their tools&quot; that is satisfying to those for whom that premise appeals. A further anthology, &quot;Freehold: Resistance&quot;, was released in December 2019. Reviewers praised the tight braiding together of the different contributions to form &quot;a mosaic novel masquerading as an anthology&quot;.

==Other works==

Among works not set in the &quot;Freehold&quot; universe is Williamson&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Hero&quot; (2004), which was written with John Ringo and made the &quot;Locus&quot; Bestseller list in February 2006. The book is a part of the &quot;Legacy of the Aldenata&quot; series. It appeared in German as &quot;Invasion – Heldentaten&quot; and in Russian as &quot;Герой&quot;. Williamson has also written the &quot;Target: Terror&quot; (2004–2005) military fiction series which is set in the world of the &quot;&quot; arcade game. His stand-alone novels include the time-travel story &quot;A Long Time Until Now&quot; (2014) which was praised for its characterization and survivalist elements. As of 2016, Williamson&#x27;s books had sold half a million copies.

Williamson has contributed short fiction to numerous anthologies, including many which take place in the &quot;Valdemar&quot; and &quot;Elemental Masters&quot; shared universes created by Mercedes Lackey. He has also contributed stories to the &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; shared universe and to many anthologies of military science fiction published by Baen. An anthology of Williamson&#x27;s short fiction, &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; (2013), was reviewed by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; which singled out &quot;The Humans call it Duty&quot; as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;Desert Blues&quot; as &quot;subtly haunting&quot;.

In 2015, Baen Books released an anthology, &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Military SF &amp; Space Opera&quot;, which was described by Don Sakers of &quot;Analog&quot; as &quot;long overdue&quot;. Baen Books invited readers to vote for the best story from the volume. Sakers commented: &quot;We can only hope that the award, like the anthology, will become an annual event.&quot; Williamson won the readers&#x27; poll for the short story &quot;Soft Casualty&quot; and was presented with an award at Dragon Con. The story deals with psychological warfare as an occupying force encounters harsh resistance tactics.

Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Wisdom from My Internet&quot; (2014), a collection of witticisms and political polemic from the Internet, was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2015, as a result of the Sad Puppies ballot manipulation campaign. Hugo voters ranked &quot;Wisdom from My Internet&quot; below &quot;No Award&quot;. Williamson himself stated while the poll was underway that he had voted for no award in all categories, including the one in which his own work appeared.

==Themes==
Williamson was recruited as an author by ex-soldier and publisher Jim Baen who &quot;recruited a batch of younger, like-minded authors from similar backgrounds&quot;; Williamson, David Drake, John Ringo and Tom Kratman. Commonalities in the works of these authors include the setting of a civilization in decline with heroes battling against conventional wisdom. John Clute comments in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; that a pattern running through the works of Williamson is a fight to maintain freedom against external enemies with the heroes adhering to libertarian principles. Clute notes the frequent presence of female heroes in Williamson&#x27;s works and feminist critic Liz Bourke describes Williamson&#x27;s treatment of female characters as &quot;less clearly marginalizing&quot; than that of John Ringo and Tom Kratman.

Blair Nicholson, in a doctoral thesis from the University of Waikato, points out commonalities in the authorial stances of Williamson and David Weber who both emphasize that in military science fiction, the hypothesized military environment must be depicted in realistic detail down to details of strategy and tactics. According to Williamson the work should then seek to &quot;explore the proposed system, and its interactions with the people – soldiers and civilians – involved&quot;. Nicholson notes that Williamson depicts the United Nations as an enemy, and particularly so in his &quot;Freehold&quot; (2004) novel, where the United Nations appears as an authoritarian oppressor. This depiction of the United Nations has parallels in the &quot;Marine in Space&quot; series by Ian Douglas and in the works of Tom Kratman and is reflective of a negative right-wing popular opinion on the institution.

<doc id="1136996" wikidata="Q444876" url="?curid=1136996" title="Paavo Haavikko">
<text>Paavo Juhani Haavikko (January 25, 1931 – October 6, 2008) was a Finnish poet, playwright, essayist and publisher, considered one of the country&#x27;s most outstanding writers. He published more than 70 works, and his poems have been translated to 12 languages.

== Biography ==
Paavo Haavikko was born and grew up in Helsinki. His father was a bookbinder and later worked in the import business. In 1951, Haavikko graduated from the Kallio Coeducational School, and published his first collection of poems. 
In the 1950s, Haavikko published several more poetry collections, culminating in the collection entitled Talvipalatsi (&#x27;The Winter Palace&#x27;; 1959). He was at the forefront of the emerging modernist movement in Finland, and in the following decades he had a profound influence on many other genres as well. As a result of his literary achievements, he became the leading writer of his generation and of the entire postwar period in Finland.
Haavikko&#x27;s first wife Marja-Liisa Vartio was also a writer. They had two children. Marja-Liisa Vartio died in 1966, and Haavikko stopped writing for a long time. Haavikko married Ritva Rainio in 1971. They lived separately since 1983.

== Career as a writer ==
Haavikko started his career as a poet, but he published in almost every genre of literature. His drama has seldom been played on traditional theatre scenes. Television series Rauta-aika illustrated freely the Finnish National epic Kalevala. Operas &quot;Ratsumies&quot; (English title: The Horseman) and &quot;Kuningas lähtee Ranskaan&quot; (English title: The King goes forth to France) were composed by Aulis Sallinen to librettos by Haavikko.

Haavikko placed many of his works in historical context but included references to more modern politics, such as Juho Kusti Paasikivi and Stalin in his play Agricola ja kettu (&#x27;Agricola and the Fox&#x27;), or Urho Kaleva Kekkonen as a Viking ruler. He scrutinized Finland&#x27;s leading politicians and civil servants in his column in weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti.

Images occurring often in Haavikko&#x27;s poetry included the king, palaces, gardens, and the woods. Haavikko was talented in describing love, romantic and relationships between men and women. After the death of his first wife he started to write about subjects less discussed in poetry: economy, politics and society.

== Reception ==
The high opinion of Haavikko&#x27;s poetry was not confined to his home country: John Ashbery considered The Winter Palace as &quot;one of the great poems of the century&quot;.

== Business life ==
From 1967 to 1983, Haavikko was literary director of the Otava publishing company, and from 1989 to his death owner of the Art House publishing company.

He and his family had a company producing peat for fuel. He also owned forest. When he died, his family inherited 3 million euros.

==Honours==
*Aleksis Kivi Prize, Finnish Literature Society, 1966
*Pro Finlandia Medal, 1967,
*Honorary Doctorate from the University of Helsinki, 1969
*Knight First Class of the White Rose of Finland, 1978
* Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1984.
*In 1993, he won the Swedish Academy Nordic Prize, known as the &#x27;little Nobel&#x27;.
*America Award, 2007

==Works==
Haavikko&#x27;s works represent many different literary genres, including the librettos for the two operas. His career as is exceptional in its mere productivity: a book every eight months according to his own reckoning.

<text>Noam David Elkies (born August 25, 1966) is a professor of mathematics at Harvard University. At age 26, he became the youngest professor to receive tenure at Harvard. He is also a pianist, chess national master, and chess composer.

==Early life and education==
Elkies was born to an engineer father and a piano teacher mother. He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City for three years before graduating in 1982 at age 15. A child prodigy, in 1981, at age 14, Elkies was awarded a gold medal at the 22nd International Mathematical Olympiad, receiving a perfect score of 42, one of the youngest to ever do so. He went on to Columbia University, where he won the Putnam competition at age 16 and four months, making him one of the youngest Putnam Fellows in history. Elkies was a Putnam Fellow twice more during his undergraduate years. He graduated valedictorian of his class in 1985. He then earned his PhD in 1987 under the supervision of Benedict Gross and Barry Mazur at Harvard University.

From 1987 to 1990, Elkies was a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows.

==Work in mathematics==
In 1987, Elkies proved that an elliptic curve over the rational numbers is supersingular at infinitely many primes. In 1988, he found a counterexample to Euler&#x27;s sum of powers conjecture for fourth powers. His work on these and other problems won him recognition and a position as an associate professor at Harvard in 1990. In 1993, Elkies was made a full, tenured professor at age 26. This made him the youngest full professor in Harvard&#x27;s history. He and A. O. L. Atkin extended Schoof&#x27;s algorithm to create the Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm.

Elkies also studies the connections between music and mathematics; he is on the advisory board of the &quot;Journal of Mathematics and Music&quot;. He has discovered many new patterns in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life and has studied the mathematics of still life patterns in that cellular automaton rule. Elkies is an associate of Harvard&#x27;s Lowell House.

Elkies is one of the principal investigators of the Simons Collaboration on Arithmetic Geometry, Number Theory, and Computation, a large multi-university collaboration involving Boston University, Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, and MIT.

Elkies is the discoverer (or joint-discoverer) of many current and past record-holding elliptic curves, including the curve with the highest-known lower bound (≥28) on its rank, and the curve with the highest-known exact rank (=20). In August 2024, he posted to a number theory listserv that he and Zev Klagsbrun had found an elliptic curve of rank at least 29 by methods similar to those used to find the rank 28 example.

==Music==
Elkies is a bass-baritone and formerly played the piano for the Harvard Glee Club. Jameson N. Marvin, former director of the Glee Club, compared him to &quot;a Bach or a Mozart&quot;, citing his &quot;gifted musicality, superior musicianship and sight-reading ability&quot;. He rings the bells of Lowell House.

==Chess==
Elkies is a composer and solver of chess problems (winning the 1996 World Chess Solving Championship). One of his problems appears in the chess trainer Mark Dvoretsky&#x27;s book &quot;Dvoretsky&#x27;s Endgame Manual&quot;. Elkies holds the title of National Master from the United States Chess Federation, but no longer plays competitively.

==Awards and honors==
In 1994, Elkies was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich. In 2004, he received a Lester R. Ford Award and the Levi L. Conant Prize. In 2017, Elkies was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

<text>Frederick Allan Hartley Jr. (February 22, 1902 – May 11, 1969) was an American Republican politician from New Jersey. Hartley served ten terms in the United States House of Representatives where he represented the New Jersey&#x27;s 8th and New Jersey&#x27;s 10th congressional districts. He is by far best known for being the House of Representatives sponsor of the Taft–Hartley Act in 1947.

==Background==
Hartley was born in Harrison, New Jersey, on February 22, 1902. After going through the Harrison public schools and Rutgers Preparatory School for high school, Hartley went on to attend Rutgers University. Following his studies in 1923, he successfully ran for the position of library commissioner for Kearny, New Jersey. After holding that position for two years, Hartley was named as the police and fire commissioner for Kearny, a position he held until 1928. In that same year, he was nominated as a Republican to run for the United States House of Representatives seat for New Jersey&#x27;s 8th congressional district. Hartley defeated the incumbent Paul J. Moore in a close election on November 6, 1928. The final vote count in the election was 64,915 votes for Hartley and 64,594 for Moore, making the margin of defeat a slim 0.2%.

==Politics==
Hartley was sworn in at age twenty-seven as the youngest member of the 71st United States Congress on March 4, 1929. Hartley was again challenged by Paul J. Moore in the 1930 House elections for the seat in New Jersey&#x27;s 8th district. In another close race, Hartley beat out Moore, capturing 44,038 votes, or 50.4% of the vote, in comparison to 43,195 votes (or 49.4%) of the vote for Moore.

He was one of a relatively small number of Republicans to hold their seats throughout the Great Depression and World War II. In the 1932 election, he defeated William W. Harrison for the House seat in New Jersey&#x27;s 10th congressional district. and in the 1934 he beat William Herda Smith. Hartley had another close race in 1936, in which he beat out Democratic challenger Lindsay H. Rudd in a close 50.2%-49.6% race. Hartley soundly defeated Rudd again in 1938, and won re-election in 1940 against William W. Holmwood, in 1942 against Frederic Bigelow, in 1944 against Luke A. Kiernan Jr., and in 1946 against his future successor Peter W. Rodino Jr.

===Taft–Hartley===
Hartley found the level of postwar labor unrest to be very disturbing, and felt that it threatened both economic and political stability. In 1946, the Republicans returned their first majority in both houses of Congress since the 1928 election in which Hartley was first elected.

With his party in the majority, Hartley served as the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 80th United States Congress. Along with Senator Robert A. Taft who was chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the next year he introduced legislation to curb what he felt were the worst of labor&#x27;s excesses. The resultant Taft–Hartley Act was a major revision of the 1935 Wagner Act (officially known as the National Labor Relations Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by the post-war Congress. The act placed limits on labor tactics such as the secondary boycott, and gave each state the option to enact right-to-work laws if it so chose (28 states have done so). This provision, known as Section 14(b), was one of the act&#x27;s most controversial.

President Harry S. Truman vetoed the act, but Congress overrode the veto on June 23, 1947, with 20 of the 45 Democratic senators and 107 of the 188 Democratic representatives joining with Republicans to override the veto. It is in the platform of all major U.S. labor unions to call for the repeal of the act, especially Section 14 (b), and at times this has been reflected in the platform of the Democratic Party. However, the only time this has ever seemed likely was when the Democrats had a huge majority in both houses of Congress following the Republican electoral disaster of 1964. Even then, the repeal bill passed 221–203 in the House, but the two-thirds majority it needed in the Senate was never attained, partly because of long filibustering by Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. Labor allies failed to break the filibuster, and the repeal bill was withdrawn by the Democratic Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, in 1966.

Hartley did not seek any further election to Congress following the term in which the act which bears his name was passed, and his service concluded on January 3, 1949.

==Later life==
Hartley ran unsuccessfully for one of the two New Jersey senatorial seats in 1954 and he returned to New Jersey and lived for fifteen more years as a business consultant, seeing the act withstand its toughest test and remain intact.

He died in Linwood, New Jersey, and was buried in Fairmount Cemetery, in Newark. His son, Al Hartley, was a cartoonist best known for his work on Archie Comics.

==Commerce==
, Cofradia is considered part of San Pedro Sula municipality, since San Pedro Sula&#x27;s development can only grow southwestward; in fact, 5 maquilas have already opened in that sector.
Development may be limited by the fact that the area is not properly legalised, and has lands to which more than one owner can produce a title; as a result it is hard to legally buy and sell property.

The commercial zone is the centre of Cofradia, where most retail buying and selling occurs.

==Events==

General Esperanzano Gregorio Ferrera surrendered at Cofradia 26 June 1931 after a six-years-long attempted uprising.

Telegraph service in Cofradia began 7 November 1905; the first telegraphist was Don Juan Magnar. Other early telegraphists were Cesar Mejia, who arrived in 1908 from an unknown location and Don Rodolfo Castillo who arrived on 7 March 1911 from Santa Bárbara.

The dam was built in 1936–37 under the supervision of engineer Gonzalo R. Luque. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time was Don José Castro López, who presided over the inauguration of the dam 24 December 1937.

==Education==

The first school was founded in 1900; its first teacher was Don Filadelfo López Morales.

A boys&#x27; school was founded in 1900, by teacher Donaldo Sabillon Vásquez.

The girls&#x27; school was founded between in 1905 and 1912; its first teacher was Elvia Julia Morales.

Another boys&#x27; school was founded in 1930 under the direction of Leandro Rodríguez.

The Miguel Paz Barahona girls school was founded 24 December 1937 at the same time as the inauguration of a municipal water system. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time, Don José Castro López, appointed Doña Laura Vda. de Alcocer the director, and in 1920 Don Donaldo was promoted to the position, with a monthly salary of Lps. 90.

At that time, sixth grade was offered only in the more advanced villages, with children in others only going to the fifth grade. The age of matriculation ranged between 7 and 18 years. The teachers were very strict disciplinarians: if a student failed to show up for school, a teacher&#x27;s assistant would seek the student out and bring him or her back to school, to be punished there by the teacher; and punished again by his or her parents upon arriving back home. The students received 8 hours of lessons daily. Teaching materials for students included a notebook made of sewn office paper, ink made with blue aniline. Pencils were of made candle wax, the satchels were made of cloth or nylon.

<doc id="1137017" wikidata="Q2758957" url="?curid=1137017" title="Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)">
<text>&quot;Today&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics; Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having suicidal thoughts. The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song&#x27;s tale of depression and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, distorted guitars.

&quot;Today&quot; was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band&#x27;s second album and major label debut, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. &quot;Today&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Disarm&quot; are credited in AllMusic for popularizing the band and &quot;sen[ding] [&quot;Siamese Dream&quot;] into the stratosphere&quot;. &quot;Today&quot; has been generally well received by critics; a &quot;Blender&quot; article described it as having &quot;achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s&quot;.

== Background and recording ==

After the release and minor success of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Gish&quot;, the Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as &quot;the next Nirvana&quot;. However, the band was experiencing several difficulties at the time. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin; James Iha and D&#x27;arcy Wretzky had recently broken up their romantic relationship; and Billy Corgan had become depressed to the point of contemplating suicide and plagued by writer&#x27;s block. Corgan recalled that &quot;after the first album, I became completely suicidal. It was an eight-month depression, give or take a month, and I was pretty suicidal for about two or three months.&quot; Under the pressure and other complications, the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in Atlanta to record the follow-up to &quot;Gish&quot;.

Corgan said, &quot;The day after I wrote &#x27;Today&#x27;, my manager heard it and said, &#x27;It&#x27;s a hit&#x27;, and I guess in a way, it was.&quot; Corgan played the self-recorded demo to producer Butch Vig and to the rest of his band, all of whom responded positively. &quot;Today&quot; already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, &quot;out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head&quot;, Corgan said. &quot;When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud.&quot; Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of &quot;Today&quot;.

&quot;Siamese Dream&quot; was completed after running four months after the deadline and considerably exceeding its budget. Virgin Records executives saw &quot;Today&quot; as the ideal lead single, but Corgan wanted &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, one of the last songs written for the album, as the lead single. Ultimately, &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; was released first, but it was only a modest success. &quot;Today&quot; brought the band popularity through wide radio airplay and a successful music video.

== Composition and lyrics ==
&quot;Today&quot; is written in the key of E-flat major (E) and its guitar parts are played in standard tuning. While Corgan briefly considered tuning the guitar down a half-step and playing the song with the fingerings and positions of E major, he said, &quot;There was something about the E voicing that I liked. So it&#x27;s absolutely, intentionally in E, not E.&quot; &quot;Today&quot; is one of the &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; songs on which Corgan took over Iha and Wretzky&#x27;s duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan &quot;can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20&quot;.

The song, spanning three minutes and 21 seconds, begins with a one-measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E major-pentatonic scale. Corgan uses this riff (along with variations on it) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song. After the riff is played four times, the rest of the band enters backed with feedback-driven guitars. Ned Raggett of Allmusic commented on the song&#x27;s ability to &quot;alternate between calmer, almost Cure-like sections and the louder crunches, [and Corgan&#x27;s] soon-to-be-trademark guitar style taking My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s own hypnotic riffing to more accessible results&quot;. The chorus, consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing barre chords, is an example of the band&#x27;s tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks. While the song does not include a standard guitar solo, a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge. Corgan explained: &quot;The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards. Then there&#x27;s a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers, a &#x27;yan-yan-yan-yan&#x27; thing, which was generated by using a Roland Space Echo to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line, &#x27;I wanna turn you on.

The dark, ironic lyrics of &quot;Today&quot;, describing a day when Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that the song is &quot;downright pretty as rock ballads go&quot; but that &quot;Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks.&quot; Corgan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;I was really suicidal ... I just thought it was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can&#x27;t get any worse.&quot; Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot; to &quot;ripping [his] guts out&quot;.

== Music video ==
The music video, directed by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success to the band through repeated airplay on MTV. Debuting in September 1993, it was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that the video&#x27;s plot was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out the rest of his ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui&#x27;s own sensibilities inspired by the film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;. The video is available on &quot;The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000)&quot; DVD, released in 2001.

The video begins with Corgan reading a comic book dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped repeatedly before the song begins. Groups of two or more people are kissing each other around him as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in various colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out, and the video ends with him walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993. The opening shots were filmed outside the Taft Hardware • Wilsons building located at 331 Center Street, Taft, CA, 93268, on the 4th street side of the building.

== Reception ==

&quot;Today&quot; has received generally positive reviews. Ned Raggett of AllMusic called the song an &quot;at-once storming but catchy smash single&quot;. Johnny Black of &quot;Blender&quot; noted that the song &quot;has achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation&quot;. Robert Christgau cited &quot;Today&quot; as one of the highlights of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. However, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Brett Hickman said &quot;nothing can make &#x27;Today&#x27; sound fresh again [on the live album &quot;Earphoria&quot;, which this particular review is of]. This is a prime example of the power that radio and MTV have in ruining a great song.&quot; &quot;Today&quot; topped &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end list of best singles, and also appeared at number 32 on &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s year-end list of best singles.

&quot;Today&quot; was one of the most successful early singles by the Smashing Pumpkins, and additionally has been recognized as one of the songs that brought the Pumpkins into the mainstream. The song was, at the time of its release, the highest-charting song by the band, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks. The song also reached a peak position of number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks, and was one of the first Pumpkins songs to chart in the UK, peaking at number 44. &quot;Today&quot; was later called one of the &quot;hits that took the cool alternative band into stadium rock territory&quot; by the BBC&#x27;s Dan Tallis in a review of the band&#x27;s greatest hits album, &quot;Rotten Apples&quot;, and similarly referred to as the &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; red carpet to the glorified frat houses of alternative rock radio&quot; by Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media.

=== Accolades ===

== Other releases ==

&quot;Today&quot; has appeared on several Smashing Pumpkins official releases, including the band&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Rotten Apples&quot; and the box set &quot;Siamese Singles&quot;. A live version of &quot;Today&quot; performed in the band&#x27;s hometown of Chicago was included on the 1994 video release &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; and on its companion album &quot;Earphoria&quot;, and was praised as &quot;a triumphant recording&quot; by Pitchfork&#x27;s Chris Dahlen. A different live recording from Chicago appears on the promotional album &quot;Live in Chicago 23.10.95&quot; and the song is featured on 14 volumes of &quot;Live Smashing Pumpkins&quot;. The song has also appeared in different versions on several Smashing Pumpkins bootlegs such as &quot;Unplugged: 100% Pure Acoustic Performances&quot;, which includes unofficial live recordings and acoustic recordings.

&quot;Today&quot; has been included in a few compilation albums. The eighteenth volume of &quot;Indie Top 20&quot;, a &quot;Melody Maker&quot;-sponsored compilation series which serves as a &quot;time capsule of U.K. indie music&quot;, features &quot;Today&quot; as its fourth track. The song appears on a two-disc MTV Dutch import, &quot;Rock Am Ring&quot;, a collection of hit singles from the early 1990s.

=== Cover versions ===

The song has been covered for several tribute albums. &quot;A Gothic–Industrial Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins&quot; features a dance music-influenced version of the song by industrial band Shining. Solomon Burke Jr., the son of influential soul musician Solomon Burke, contributed a &quot;radically altered&quot; rendition of &quot;Today&quot; for &quot;Midnight in the Patch: Tribute to the Smashing Pumpkins&quot;, performing the song in a Motown style. Other covers of &quot;Today&quot; for tribute albums include performances by Armor for Sleep on &quot;The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins&quot; and by Death Rawk Boy on &quot;Ghost Children / Friends and Enemies&quot;. The main guitar passage was also sampled by Japanese hip-hop act Dragon Ash in its song &quot;Grateful Days&quot;. It was covered by John Craigie on his album &quot;Leave the Fire Behind&quot;. Deerhunter reinterpreted the song live in 2015, following a legal dispute between frontman Bradford Cox and Corgan, &quot;transforming the song&#x27;s opening riff into a 10-minute noise-pop improvisation&quot;. In 2020 the Fruit Bats released a &quot;breezy cover&quot; of &quot;Today&quot; and a re-working of the entire &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; album. A. G. Cook also covered the song in 2020 on his debut album &quot;7G,&quot; and covered it once more under the title &quot;Today (Dream Mix)&quot; on his follow-up remix album &quot;Apple vs. 7G&quot;, using an altered chord progression. It was covered by Olivia Holt in 2021 for the TV series &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;.

<text>Hi-Fi Sci-Fi is the fifth studio album by alternative rock group Dramarama. Released in 1993, it was also their last studio album until &quot;Everybody Dies&quot; was released in 2005.

==Critical reception==
Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;what&#x27;s confusing, and a stroke, is that with Clem Burke pounding the skins and the band mixing and matching, it rocks louder, harder, and faster than anything they&#x27;ve done since going pro—or ever.&quot;

<doc id="1137033" wikidata="Q3514616" url="?curid=1137033" title="Abstract semantic graph">
<text>In computer science, an abstract semantic [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] (ASG) or term graph is a form of abstract syntax in which an expression of a formal or programming language is represented by a graph whose vertices are the expression&#x27;s subterms. An ASG is at a higher level of abstraction than an abstract syntax tree (or AST), which is used to express the syntactic structure of an expression or program.

ASGs are more complex and concise than ASTs because they may contain shared subterms (also known as &quot;common subexpressions&quot;). Abstract semantic graphs are often used as an intermediate representation by compilers to store the results of performing common subexpression elimination upon abstract syntax trees. ASTs are trees and are thus incapable of representing shared terms. ASGs are usually directed acyclic graphs (DAG), although in some applications graphs containing cycles may be permitted. For example, a graph containing a cycle might be used to represent the recursive expressions that are commonly used in functional programming languages as non-looping iteration constructs. The mutability of these types of graphs, is studied in the field of graph rewriting.

The nomenclature &quot;term graph&quot; is associated with the field of term graph rewriting, which involves the transformation and processing of expressions by the specification of rewriting rules, whereas &quot;abstract semantic graph&quot; is used when discussing linguistics, programming languages, type systems and compilation.

Abstract syntax trees are not capable of sharing subexpression nodes because it is not possible for a node in a proper tree to have more than one parent. Although this conceptual simplicity is appealing, it may come at the cost of redundant representation and, in turn, possibly inefficiently duplicating the computation of identical terms. For this reason ASGs are often used as an intermediate language at a subsequent compilation stage to abstract syntax tree construction via parsing.

An abstract semantic graph is typically constructed from an abstract syntax tree by a process of enrichment and abstraction. The enrichment can for example be the addition of back-pointers, edges from an identifier node (where a variable is being used) to a node representing the declaration of that variable. The abstraction can entail the removal of details which are relevant only in parsing, not for semantics.

== Example: Code Refactoring ==
For example, consider the case of code refactoring. To represent the implementation of a function that takes an input argument, the received parameter is conventionally given an arbitrary, distinct name in the source code so that it can be referenced. The abstract representation of this conceptual entity, a &quot;function argument&quot; instance, will likely be mentioned in the function signature, and also one or more times within the implementation code body. Since the function as a whole is the parent of both its header or &quot;signature&quot; information as well as its implementation body, an AST would not be able to use the same node to co-identify the multiple uses or appearances of the argument entity. This is solved by the DAG nature of an ASG. A key advantage of having a single, distinct node identity for any given code element is that each element&#x27;s properties are, by definition, uniquely stored. This simplifies refactoring operations, because there is exactly one existential nexus for any given property instantiation. If the developer decides to change a property value such as the &quot;name&quot; of any code element (the &quot;function argument&quot; in this example), the ASG inherently exposes that value in exactly one place, and it follows that any such property changes are implicitly, trivially, and immediately propagated globally.

<text>Satyagraha (; Sanskrit सत्याग्रह, &quot;satyāgraha&quot; &quot;insistence on truth&quot;) is a 1980 opera in three acts for orchestra, chorus and soloists, composed by Philip Glass, with a libretto by Glass and Constance DeJong.

Loosely based on the life of Mahatma Gandhi, it forms the second part of Glass&#x27;s &quot;Portrait Trilogy&quot; of operas about men who changed the world, which also includes &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; and &quot;Akhnaten&quot;.

Glass&#x27;s style can broadly be described as minimalist. The work is scored for 2 sopranos, 2 mezzo-sopranos, 2 tenors, a baritone, 2 basses, a large SATB chorus, and an orchestra of strings and woodwinds only, no brass or percussion. Principal roles are Sonja Schlesin, Mahatma Gandhi, Hermann Kallenbach and Parsi Rustomji.

The title refers to Gandhi&#x27;s concept of nonviolent resistance to injustice, satyagraha, and the text, from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, is sung in the original Sanskrit. In performance, translation is usually provided in supertitles.

==Performance history==

&quot;Satyagraha&quot; was commissioned by the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands, and first performed at the (Municipal Theatre) there on September 5, 1980, by the Netherlands Opera, featuring the choir of the Rotterdam Conservatory and the , conducted by .

The opera premiered in North America at the Artpark in Lewiston, New York, on July 29, 1981. That production was mounted later that year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The opera was also staged that same year by the Stuttgart Opera (which went on to perform the complete trilogy in 1990); this production was taped during its revival in 1983 and released on video.

The Lyric Opera of Chicago presented the first production by a major international opera company on September 28, 1987, at the Civic Opera House. Douglas Perry sang the role of Gandhi.

The UK premiere was a joint production by Bath Spa University and Frome Community College in the theatre of Kingswood School in Bath in 1997.

There was a performance by San Francisco Opera at the War Memorial Opera House in 1989.

 staged a new production of the opera in 2004 at the Theater Bonn, Germany, with a revival in 2013, with Ulrich Windfuhr conducting the Beethoven Orchester Bonn.

A new staging by the English National Opera and Improbable theatre, co-produced by the Metropolitan Opera, opened in London in April 2007 and in New York in April 2008. It was revived in London in February 2010 and in New York in November 2011; the New York performance on November 19 was part of the Met Opera: Live in HD series. It aired on Great Performances from PBS in 2012, Season 39 Episode 19 on March 22 and March 25. The Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 2011 production was streamed online on June 21 and November 1, 2020.

On September 16, 2014, a new production was staged at the Ekaterinburg State Academic Opera in Russia. The creative team included Thaddeus Strassberger (direction and scenic design), Mattie Ullrich (costume design) and Oliver von Dohnányi (conductor).

A new production by Folkoperan and Cirkus Cirkör, directed by and conducted by Matthew Wood premiered in Stockholm on September 14, 2016. It was revived twice in Stockholm in April 2017 and in May 2018. The production also went on tour to Stora Teatern in May 2017, to the Copenhagen Opera Festival in August 2018 and to the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Harvey Theater in October – November 2018. Leif Aruhn-Solén sang the role of Gandhi nearly 50 times and is therefore likely the singer who has performed the role the most.

On 18 November 2018, Vlaamse Opera premiered a production by director and choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, together with stage designer Henrik Ahr and costume designer Jan-Jan Van Essche

<doc id="1137047" wikidata="Q4018575" url="?curid=1137047" title="Waw (letter)">
<text>Waw ( &quot;hook&quot;) is the sixth letter of the Semitic abjads, including 
Phoenician &quot;wāw&quot; 𐤅, 
Aramaic &quot;waw&quot; 𐡅,
Hebrew &quot;vav&quot; , 
Syriac &quot;waw&quot; ܘ 
and Arabic &quot;wāw&quot; (sixth in abjadi order; 27th in modern Arabic order).

It represents the consonant in classical Hebrew, and in modern Hebrew, as well as the vowels and . In text with niqqud, a dot is added to the left or on top of the letter to indicate, respectively, the two vowel pronunciations.

It is the origin of Greek Ϝ (digamma) and Υ (upsilon); Latin F, V and later the derived Y, U and W; and the also derived Cyrillic У and Ѵ.

==Origin==
The letter likely originated with an Egyptian hieroglyph which represented the word &quot;mace&quot; (transliterated as &quot;ḥḏ&quot;, &quot;hedj&quot;): T3
A mace was a ceremonial stick or staff, similar to a scepter, perhaps derived from weapons or hunting tools. 

In Modern Hebrew, the word &#x27; &quot;vav&quot; is used to mean both &quot;hook&quot; and the letter&#x27;s name (the name is also written &#x27;), while in Syriac and Arabic, &quot;waw&quot; to mean &quot;hook&quot; has fallen out of use.

==Arabic wāw==
The Arabic letter &#x27; is named &#x27; &quot;wāw&quot; and is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:
Wāw is used to represent four distinct phonetic features:
*A consonant, pronounced as a voiced labial-velar approximant , which is the case whenever it is at the beginning of a word, and sometimes elsewhere.
*A long . The preceding consonant could either have no diacritic or a short-wāw-vowel mark, damma, to aid in the pronunciation by hinting to the following long vowel.
*A long in many dialects, as a result of the monophthongization that the diphthong underwent in most of words. 
*Part of the sequence . In this case it has no diacritic, but could be marked with a sukun in some traditions. The preceding consonant could either have no diacritic or have a sign, hinting to the first vowel in the diphthong.

As a vowel, &quot;wāw&quot; can serve as the carrier of a hamza: . The isolated form of &quot;waw&quot; (و) is believed to be the origins of the numeral 9.

&quot;Wāw&quot; is the sole letter of the common Arabic word &quot;wa,&quot; the primary conjunction in Arabic, equivalent to &quot;and&quot;. In writing, it is prefixed to the following word, sometimes including other conjunctions, such as &quot;wa-lākin&quot;, meaning &quot;but&quot;. Another function is the &quot;oath&quot;, by preceding a noun of great significance to the speaker. It is often literally translatable to &quot;By...&quot; or &quot;I swear to...&quot;, and is often used in the Qur&#x27;an in this way, and also in the generally fixed construction &quot;wallāh&quot; (&quot;By Allah!&quot; or &quot;I swear to God!&quot;). The word also appears, particularly in classical verse, in the construction known as &quot;wāw rubba&quot;, to introduce a description.

=== Derived letters ===

With an additional triple dot diacritic above &quot;waw&quot;, the letter then named &quot;ve&quot; is used to represent distinctively the consonant in Arabic-based Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz.
 in Kurdish, Beja, and Kashmiri; in Arabic-based Kazakh; in Uyghur.
Thirty-fourth letter of the Azerbaijani Arabic script, represents ü .
A variant of Kurdish &quot;û&quot; ; historically for Serbo-Croatian .

Also used in Kyrgyz for Үү /y/.
 in Uyghur. Also found in Quranic Arabic as in &quot;prayer&quot; for an Old Higazi merged with , in modern spelling .
 in Southern Kurdish.
In Jawi script for .
Also used in Balochi for and .

==Hebrew waw/vav==
Hebrew spelling: or or .

;The letter appears with or without a hook on different sans-serif fonts, for example:
* Arial, DejaVu Sans, Arimo, Open Sans: ו
* Tahoma, Alef, Heebo: ו

===Pronunciation in Modern Hebrew===
Vav has three orthographic variants, each with a different phonemic value and phonetic realisation:

In modern Hebrew, the frequency of the usage of vav, out of all the letters, is one of the highest, about 10.00%.

====Vav as consonant====
Consonantal vav () generally represents a voiced labiodental fricative (like the English v) in Ashkenazi, European Sephardi, Persian, Caucasian, Italian and modern Israeli Hebrew, and was originally a labial-velar approximant .

In modern Israeli Hebrew, some loanwords, the pronunciation of whose source contains , and their derivations, are pronounced with : – (but: – ).

Modern Hebrew has no standardized way to distinguish orthographically between and . The pronunciation is determined by prior knowledge or must be derived through context.

Some non standard spellings of the sound are sometimes found in modern Hebrew texts, such as word-initial double-vav: – (word-&quot;medial&quot; double-vav is both standard and common for both and , see table above) or, rarely, vav with a geresh: – .

====Vav with a dot on top====

Vav can be used as a mater lectionis for an &quot;o&quot; vowel, in which case it is known as a &quot;&quot;, which in pointed text is marked as vav with a dot above it. It is pronounced (phonemically transcribed more simply as ).

The distinction is normally ignored, and the HEBREW POINT HOLAM (U+05B9) is used in all cases.

The vowel can be denoted without the vav, as just the dot placed above and to the left of the letter it points, and it is then called &quot;&quot;. Some inadequate typefaces do not support the distinction between the &#x27; ⟨⟩ , the consonantal vav pointed with a &#x27; ⟨⟩ (compare &#x27; ⟨⟩ and consonantal vav-&#x27; ⟨⟩ ). To display a consonantal vav with &quot;&quot; correctly, the typeface must either support the vav with the Unicode combining character &quot;HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV&quot; (U+05BA, HTML Entity (decimal) &amp;#1466;) or the precomposed character (U+FB4B). 

Compare the three:
# The vav with the combining character HEBREW POINT HOLAM: 
# The vav with the combining character HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV: 
# The precomposed character: 

====Vav with a dot in the middle====

Vav can also be used as a &quot;mater lectionis&quot; for , in which case it is known as a &quot;shuruk&quot;, and in text with niqqud is marked with a dot in the middle (on the left side).

Shuruk and vav with a dagesh look identical (&quot;&quot;) and are only distinguishable through the fact that in text with niqqud, vav with a dagesh will normally be attributed a vocal point in addition, e.g. (), &quot;a market&quot;, (the &quot;&quot; denotes a shuruk) as opposed to (), &quot;to market&quot; (the &quot;&quot; denotes a vav with dagesh and is additionally pointed with a zeire, &quot;  &quot;, denoting ). In the word (), &quot;marketing&quot;, the first (&quot;&quot;) denotes a vav with dagesh, the second a shuruk, being the vowel attributed to the first.

When a vav with a dot in the middle comes at the start of a word without a vowel attributed to it, it is a &quot;vav conjunctive&quot; (see below) that comes before ב, ו, מ, פ, or a letter with a ְ (Shva), and it does the ⟨ʔu⟩ sound.

===Numerical value===
Vav in gematria represents the number six, and when used at the beginning of Hebrew years, it means 6000 (i.e. in numbers would be the date 6754.)

===Words written as vav===
Vav at the beginning of the word has several possible meanings:
* &quot;vav conjunctive&quot; (Vav Hachibur, literally &quot;the Vav of Connection&quot; — chibur means &quot;joining&quot;, or &quot;bringing together&quot;) connects two words or parts of a sentence; it is a grammatical conjunction meaning &quot; &#x27;and&quot;&#x27;. It comes at the start of a word, and is written וּ before ב, ו, מ, פ, or a letter with a ְ (Shva), ו with the following letter&#x27;s Hataf&#x27;s Niqqud before a letter with a Hataf (for example, before , before , before ), וָ sometimes before a stress and in any other case. This is the most common usage.
* &quot;vav consecutive&quot; (Vav Hahipuch, literally &quot;the Vav of Reversal&quot; — hipuch means &quot;inversion&quot;), mainly biblical, is commonly mistaken for the previous type of vav; it indicates consequence of actions and reverses the tense of the verb following it:
**when placed in front of a verb in the imperfect tense, it changes the verb to the perfect tense. For example, &quot;yomar&quot; means &#x27;he will say&#x27; and &quot;vayomar&quot; means &#x27;he said&#x27;;
**when placed in front of a verb in the perfect, it changes the verb to the imperfect tense. For example, &quot;ahavtah&quot; means &#x27;you loved&#x27;, and &quot;ve&#x27;ahavtah&quot; means &#x27;you will love&#x27;.
(Note: Older Hebrew did not have &quot;tense&quot; in a temporal sense, &quot;perfect,&quot; and &quot;imperfect&quot; instead denoting aspect of completed or continuing action. Modern Hebrew verbal tenses have developed closer to their Indo-European counterparts, mostly having a temporal quality rather than denoting aspect. As a rule, Modern Hebrew does not use the &quot;Vav Consecutive&quot; form.)
* &quot;vav explicative&quot;

===Yiddish===

In Yiddish, the letter (known as ) is used for several orthographic purposes in native words:
* Alone, a single vov represents the vowel in Northern Yiddish (Litvish) or in Southern Yiddish (Poylish and Galitzish).
* The digraph , &quot;&quot; (&#x27;two vovs&#x27;), represents the consonant .
* The digraph , consisting of a vov followed by a , represents the diphthong [] or [].
The single vov may be written with a dot on the left when necessary to avoid ambiguity and distinguish it from other functions of the letter. For example, the word &#x27;where&#x27; is spelled , as followed by a single vov; the single vov indicating is marked with a dot in order to distinguish which of the three vovs represents the vowel. Some texts instead separate the digraph from the single vov with a silent aleph.

Loanwords from Hebrew or Aramaic in Yiddish are spelled as they are in their language of origin.

==Syriac waw==


In the Syriac alphabet, the sixth letter is ܘ. Waw (ܘܐܘ) is pronounced [w]. When it is used as a mater lectionis, a waw with a dot &quot;above&quot; the letter is pronounced [o], and a waw with a dot under the letter is pronounced [u]. Waw has an alphabetic-numeral value of 6.

<text>Clarence Frederick Leary (11 January 1894 – 20 July 1918) was an officer in the United States Navy during World War I.

Leary was born in Fowey, England, and soon immigrated with his family to the United States. After the US entered World War I, on 12 June 1918 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve. He was later appointed the Executive Officer of the cargo ship USS &quot;Charlton Hall&quot; (ID-1359), with Lieutenant Commander J. L. Evans, USNRF, in command of the ship.

On 20 July 1918, a fire broke out in the hold of the &quot;Charlton Hall&quot;. Leary entered the burning hold in order to save crewmen who were trapped there. He died hours later of burns and smoke inhalation.

Lieutenant Clarence F. Leary was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his self-sacrificing valor.

==Namesakes==
Two ships, USS &quot;Leary&quot;, were named for him.

<doc id="1137058" wikidata="Q17525361" url="?curid=1137058" title="Yodh">
<text>Yodh (also spelled jodh, yod, or jod) is the tenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician &quot;yōd&quot; 𐤉, Hebrew &quot;yud&quot; , Aramaic &quot;yod&quot; 𐡉, Syriac &quot;yōḏ&quot; ܝ, and Arabic &quot;yāʾ&quot; . Its sound value is in all languages for which it is used; in many languages, it also serves as a long vowel, representing .

The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Iota (Ι), Latin I and J, Cyrillic І, Coptic (Ⲓ) and Gothic eis .

The term yod is often used to refer to the speech sound , a palatal approximant, even in discussions of languages not written in Semitic abjads, as in phonological phenomena such as English &quot;yod-dropping&quot;.

==Origins==

Yod originated from a hieroglyphic &quot;hand&quot;, or *yad.
D36
Before the late nineteenth century, the letter yāʼ was written without its two dots, especially those in the Levant.

==Arabic yāʼ==
The letter is named &quot;&quot; (). It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:
It is pronounced in four ways:
* As a consonant, it is pronounced as a palatal approximant , typically at the beginnings of words in front of short or long vowels.
*A long usually in the middle or end of words. In this case it has no diacritic, but could be marked with a kasra in the preceding letter in some traditions.
*A long In many dialects, as a result of the monophthongization that the diphthong underwent in most words.
* A part of a diphthong, . Then, it has no diacritic but could be marked with a sukun in some traditions. The preceding consonant could have no diacritic or have sign, hinting to the first vowel in the diphthong, i.e. .

As a vowel, yāʾ can serve as the &quot;seat&quot; of the hamza: 

Yāʾ serves several functions in the Arabic language. Yāʾ as a prefix is the marker for a singular imperfective verb, as in &#x27; &quot;he writes&quot; from the root K-T-B (&quot;write, writing&quot;). Yāʾ with a shadda is particularly used to turn a noun into an adjective, called a &quot;nisbah&quot; (). For instance, &#x27; (Egypt) → &quot;Miṣriyy&quot; (Egyptian). The transformation can be more abstract; for instance, &quot;mawḍūʿ&quot; (matter, object) → &quot;mawḍūʿiyy&quot; (). Still other uses of this function can be a bit further from the root: &quot;ishtirāk&quot; (cooperation) → &quot;ishtirākiyy&quot; (socialist). The common pronunciation of the final is most often pronounced as or .

A form similar to but distinguished from yāʾ is the &quot;&quot; () &quot;limited/restricted alif&quot;, with the form . It indicates a final long .

=== Alif maqṣūrah ===

In Arabic, &quot;alif maqṣūrah&quot; is the letter &quot;yāʼ&quot; without its two dots, and it is thus written as:

However, this letter cannot be used initially or medially in Arabic. The &quot;alif maqṣūrah&quot; with hamza is thus written as:
===Perso-Arabic ye===


In the Persian alphabet, the letter is generally called &quot;ye&quot; following Persian-language custom. In its isolated and final forms, the letter does not have dots (), much like the Arabic &quot;Alif maqṣūrah&quot; or, more to the point, much like the custom in Egypt, Sudan and sometimes Maghreb. On account of this difference, Perso-Arabic &quot;ye&quot; is located at a different Unicode code point than both of the standard Arabic letters. In computers, the Persian version of the letter automatically appears with two dots initially and medially: ().
In Kashmiri, it uses a ring instead of dots below (ؠ) ().
=== Returned yāʾ ===
In different calligraphic styles like the Hijazi script, Kufic, and Nastaʿlīq script, a final &quot;yāʾ&quot; might have a particular shape with the descender turned to the right (), called (&quot;returned, recurred &quot;yāʾ&quot;&quot;), either with two dots or without them.

In Urdu this is called &quot;baṛī ye&quot; (&quot;big ye&quot;), but is an independent letter used for /ɛː, eː/ and differs from the basic ye (&quot;choṭī ye&quot;, &quot;little ye&quot;). For this reason the letter has its own code point in Unicode. Nevertheless, its initial and medial forms are not different from the other &quot;ye&quot; (practically &quot;baṛī ye&quot; is not used in these positions).
== Hebrew yod ==
Hebrew spelling: ; colloquial 

;The letter appears with or without a hook on different sans-serif fonts, for example:
* Arial, DejaVu Sans, Arimo, Open Sans: י
* Tahoma, Alef, Heebo: י

===Pronunciation===
In both Biblical and Modern Hebrew, Yod represents a palatal approximant (). As a mater lectionis, it represents the vowel . At the end of words with a vowel or when it is marked with a sh&#x27;va nach, it represents the formation of a &quot;diphthong&quot;, such as , , , or .

===Significance===
In gematria, Yod represents the number ten.

As a prefix, it designates the third person singular (or plural, with a Vav as a suffix) in the future tense.

As a suffix, it indicates first person singular possessive; &quot;av&quot; (father) becomes &quot;avi&quot; (my father).

&quot;Yod&quot; in Hebrew signifies iodine. Iodine is also called يود &quot;yod&quot; in Arabic.

====In religion====

Two Yods in a row () designate the name of God Adonai and in pointed texts are written with the vowels of Adonai, which is done as well with the Tetragrammaton.

As Yod is the smallest letter, much kabbalistic and mystical significance is attached to it. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus mentioned it during the Antithesis of the Law, when he says: &quot;One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot; Jot, or iota, refers to the letter Yod; it was often overlooked by scribes because of its size and position as a mater lectionis. In Modern Hebrew, the phrase &quot;tip of the Yod&quot; refers to a small and insignificant thing, and someone who &quot;worries about the tip of a Yod&quot; is someone who is picky and meticulous about small details.

Much kabbalistic and mystical significance is also attached to it because of its gematria value as ten, which is an important number in Judaism, and its place in the name of God.

===Yiddish===

In Yiddish, the letter yod is used for several orthographic purposes in native words:
* Alone, a single yod may represent the vowel or the consonant . When adjacent to another vowel, or another yod, may be distinguished from by the addition of a dot below. Thus the word &quot;Yidish&quot; &#x27;Yiddish&#x27; is spelled . The first yod represents []; the second yod represents [] and is distinguished from the adjacent [] by a dot; the third yod represents [] as well, but no dot is necessary.
* The digraph , consisting of two yods, represents the diphthong [].
* A pair of yods with a horizontal line (&quot;pasekh&quot;) under them, , represents the diphthong [] in standard Yiddish.
* The digraph consisting of a vov followed by a yod, , represents the diphthong [].

In traditional as well as in YIVO orthography, Loanwords from Hebrew or Aramaic in Yiddish are spelled as they are in their language of origin. In Soviet orthography, they are written phonetically like other Yiddish words.

<text>Townsend Cromwell (November 3, 1922 – June 2, 1958) was an oceanographer who discovered the Cromwell current while researching drifting in the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean. He died in an airplane crash, that of the Aeroméxico Flight 111 on 2 June 1958, which killed all 39 passengers and seven crew on board. The accident, also fatal to the American fisheries research biologist Bell M. Shimada, occurred near Guadalajara, Mexico, as the men were en route to join the Scot Expedition at Acapulco. Cromwell was Senior Scientist with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Research Associate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California. His field of work was the physical environment and its relation to fisheries. He became a weather officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After receiving a B.A. degree from University of California (Los Angeles) in 1947, he returned to La Jolla, his boyhood home, as a student at Scripps, receiving an M.S. degree in oceanography from the University of California (La Jolla) in 1949. At Scripps he was strongly influenced by the oceanographer H. U. Sverdrup.

From 1949 to 1953, he was Oceanographer at Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations, Honolulu, Oscar Elton Sette, then Director, and Cromwell initiated a far-sighted and intensive survey of the physical and biological characteristics of Pacific equatorial waters, which had been the subject of much speculation but little observation. For many months he participated in the field work from the fisheries research ship , and for more and harder months he carried out the analysis of the observations. As a result of this pioneering work, the knowledge of the physical and biological structure of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been vastly advanced. These achievements are the more remarkable when one notes that comparable surveys of the equatorial Atlantic and Indian oceans are still lacking.

Cromwell confirmed the existence of upwelling at the equator, disproved the existence of upwelling at the northern edge of the Equatorial Countercurrent, and originated a reasonable model of wind-induced current transport in the equatorial zone During these studies he recognized the significance of the unexpected drift of long-line fishing gear at the equator, and in 1952 he led a &quot;Hugh M. Smith&quot; cruise using drogues in current measurements. Thus, he was responsible for the discovery of the Equatorial Undercurrent the fourth member of the equatorial current system (the North Equatorial Current, Equatorial Countercurrent, and South Equatorial Current having been known for a century).

The existence of the Equatorial Undercurrent has been amply confirmed, during measurements completed a few days before Cromwell&#x27;s death, by his colleagues J. A. Knauss and J. E. King. One result of four years in close collaboration with W. S. Wooster is a joint publication, in color, of a systematic analysis of data from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (Bull. Scripps Inst. Oceanogr., 1958). The subject that aroused Cromwell&#x27;s keenest interest is the structure and formation of oceanic discontinuities, both fronts and thermoclines (Tellus, 1956; Bull. inter-Amer. trop. Tuna Comm., in press). His work was characterized throughout by close collaboration with his associates, who became his devoted friends. His personal charm and modesty, together with his scientific interest, led a number of oceanographers to join his field of activity. These include E. D. Stroup, G. W. Groves, and R. B. Montgomery.

==Personal life==
Townsend Cromwell was born 3 November 1922 at Boston, Massachusetts, one of two sons of Richard and Lucile Cromwell. He married Katharine Huchthausen in 1947. Their children are Victoria, Katharine, Townsend, Carol Eugenia, and Elaine.

==Namesake==
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries research vessel NOAAS &quot;Townsend Cromwell&quot; (R 443) was named in Townsend Cromwell″s honor.

<text>Elsa is a former privately owned mining town in the Canadian territory of Yukon, between the Stewart River valley to the south and the Mackenzie Mountains to the north. It is located at Kilometre 97 (Mile ) of the Silver Trail, approximately north of Whitehorse and east of the Alaskan border.

==History==
The town was built in 1935 by the mining company Treadwell Yukon to support the development of a new mill for the nearby deposits of silver, lead, and zinc. Treadwell&#x27;s assets were purchased by United Keno Hill Mines (UKHM) in 1946, and by the 1950s UKHM was the second largest producer of silver in Canada and the fourth largest in the world. 

At its peak in the 1960s, Elsa was home to 600 UKHM employees and their families. Due to economic pressure from decreases in the price of silver in the late 1970s, United Keno Hill Mines ceased operations in Elsa in 1989. UKHM attempted to sell mining rights to various companies but declared bankruptcy in 1998, with its mining assets reverting to the Government of Canada. 

Elsa is now a ghost town and is closed to the public.

He was also &quot;starost prenski&quot;.

He married on 3 May 1761 Maria Theresia Gräfin Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (14 February 1736/1740 - 25 September 1806), daughter of Leopold-Ferdinand Graf Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (Chlumec nad Cidlinou (Chlumetz), 17 January 1713 – 24 October 1760) and wife (married in Vienna, 6 September 1734) Maria Teresa Capece dei Marchesi di Rofrano (3 June 1715 – 12 November 1778) by whom he had a daughter, Maria Teresa (baptized on 28 November 1760 – Tours, 2 November 1834), married in 1778 Count Wincenty Tyszkiewicz (? - 1816), &quot;referendarz wielki litewski&quot;, and a son, Józef Antoni Poniatowski. He died on 3 March 1773 of tuberculosis at the age of 38.

<text>John Abernethy (19 October 1680 – 1 December 1740) was an Irish Presbyterian minister and church leader.

==Life==
He was born at Coleraine, County Londonderry, where his father John was a Presbyterian minister. John Abernethy Senior accompanied Patrick Adair on a deputation from the general committee of Ulster presbyterians, who presented a congratulatory address to William III in London 1689, and obtained from the king a letter (9 November 1689) recommending their case to Duke Schomberg.

In his thirteenth year, John Abernethy Junior entered the University of Glasgow, and on concluding his course there went on to Edinburgh, where he soon moved into the most cultured circles. Returning home, he was licensed to preach from his Presbytery before he was twenty-one. In 1701 he was called to accept charge of an important congregation in Antrim; after an interval of two years, mostly spent in further study in Dublin, he was ordained there on 8 August 1703. He became a noted debater in the synods and assemblies of his church and a leading evangelist. He has been described as being at this time &quot;the young minister of Antrim ... a man of studious habits, heretical opinions, and remarkable ability.&quot;

In 1712, he was devastated by the loss of his wife (Susannah Jordan). Five years later, he was invited to the congregation of Usher&#x27;s Quay, Dublin, and also to what was called the Old Congregation of Belfast. The synod assigned him to Dublin. After careful consideration, he refused and remained at Antrim. This refusal aroused disapproval, and controversy followed, Abernethy standing firm for religious freedom and repudiating the ecclesiastical courts. The controversy and quarrel bear the name of the two camps in the conflict, the &quot;Subscribers&quot; and the &quot;Non-subscribers.&quot; Abernethy and his associates sowed the seeds of the struggle (1821–1840) in which, under the leadership of Dr Henry Cooke, the Arian and Socinian elements of the Irish Presbyterian Church were thrown out.

Much of what he contended for, and which the &quot;Subscribers&quot; opposed bitterly, was silently granted in the lapse of time. In 1726, the &quot;Non-subscribers&quot; were cut off, with due ban and solemnity, from the Irish Presbyterian Church. In 1730 he moved to Wood Street, Dublin, succeeding Rev. Joseph Boyse. It was said of him that, although a &quot;Non-subscriber,&quot; he was a Trinitarian. However, Dr Henry Cooke stated that Arianism &quot;made very considerable progress under the patronage of high names, as Abernethy, the author of a very excellent work upon the Attributes, who gave it a great deal of eclat&quot;. In 1731 came the greatest controversy in which Abernethy was involved. It was nominally about the Test Act, but actually on the entire question of tests and disabilities. His stand was: He was nearly a century in advance of his age. He had to reason with those who denied that a Roman Catholic or Dissenter could be a &quot;man of integrity and ability.&quot;

<text>Edward Kamau Brathwaite, CHB (; 11 May 1930 – 4 February 2020), was a Barbadian poet and academic, widely considered one of the major voices in the Caribbean literary canon. Formerly a professor of Comparative Literature at New York University, Brathwaite was the 2006 International Winner of the Griffin Poetry Prize, for his volume of poetry &quot;Born to Slow Horses&quot;.

Brathwaite held a Ph.D. from the University of Sussex (1968) and was the co-founder of the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM). He received both the Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships in 1983, and was a winner of the 1994 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Bussa Award, the Casa de las Américas Prize for poetry, and the 1999 Charity Randall Citation for Performance and Written Poetry from the International Poetry Forum.

Brathwaite was noted for his studies of Black cultural life both in Africa and throughout the African diasporas of the world in works such as &quot;Folk Culture of the Slaves in Jamaica&quot; (1970); &quot;The Development of Creole Society in Jamaica, 1770–1820&quot; (1971); &quot;Contradictory Omens&quot; (1974); &quot;Afternoon of the Status Crow&quot; (1982); and &quot;History of the Voice&quot; (1984), the publication of which established him as the authority of note on nation language.

Brathwaite often made use of a combination of customized typefaces (some resembling dot matrix printing) and spelling, referred to as Sycorax video style.
==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Lawson Edward Brathwaite was born in the capital city of Bridgetown, Barbados, to Hilton and Beryl (Gill) Brathwaite. He began his secondary education in 1945 at Harrison College in Bridgetown, and while there wrote essays on jazz for a school newspaper that he started, as well as contributing articles to the literary magazine &quot;Bim&quot;. In 1949 he won the Barbados Island Scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge, where he studied English and History.
In 1953, Brathwaite received a B.A. honours degree in history from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and he also began his association with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Caribbean Voices&quot; programme in London, where many of his poems and stories were broadcast. In 1954 he received a Diploma of Education from Pembroke College, Cambridge.

===The years in Ghana===

The year 1955 found Brathwaite working as an education officer in the Gold Coast with the Ministry of Education. This saw him &quot;witness Kwame Nkrumah coming to power and Ghana becoming the first African state to gain independence, which profoundly affected his sense of Caribbean culture and identity&quot;, and he was also able to study with the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia.

In 1960, while he was on home leave from Ghana, Brathwaite married Doris Monica Wellcome, a Guyanese graduate in Home Economics and Tropical Nutrition from the University of Leicester, with whom he had a son, Michael.

During his years in Ghana, Brathwaite&#x27;s writing flowered, with &quot;Odale&#x27;s Choice&quot; (a play) premiering at the Mfantsiman Secondary School in Cape Coast, in June 1962. A full production of the play was later taken to Accra.

===Return to the Caribbean and the UK===

In 1962–63, Brathwaite crossed the waters again and found himself as resident tutor in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies in St Lucia. Later in 1963, he made his journey to the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus in Kingston, Jamaica, to teach in the history department.

In 1966, Brathwaite spearheaded, as co-founder and secretary, the organization of the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) from London, other key figures involved being John La Rose and Andrew Salkey.

In 1971 he launched &quot;Savacou&quot;, a journal of CAM, at the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year, Brathwaite received the name Kamau from Ngugi wa Thiong&#x27;o&#x27;s grandmother at Limuru, Kenya, while on a City of Nairobi Fellowship to the University of Nairobi.

His doctoral thesis from Sussex University on &quot;The Development of Creole Society in Jamaica&quot; was published in 1971 by Oxford University Press, and in 1973 he published what is generally considered his best work, &quot;The Arrivants: A New World Trilogy&quot;, comprising three earlier volumes: &quot;Rights of Passage&quot; (1967), &quot;Masks&quot; (1968) and &quot;Islands&quot; (1969). An exhaustive bibliography of his work, entitled &quot;EKB: His Published Prose &amp; Poetry, 1948–1986&quot; was produced by his wife, Doris Monica Brathwaite, in 1986. In response to her death later that year, Brathwaite wrote &quot;The Zea Mexican Diary: 7 September 1926 – 7 September 1986&quot;.

Brathwaite described the years from 1986 to 1990 as a &quot;time of salt,&quot; in which he chronicled the death of his wife in 1986, the destruction of his archive in Irish Town, Jamaica, by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and his near-death experience as a result of a Kingston shooting in 1990.

===&quot;Maroon years&quot; and afterwards===

Kamau Brathwaite spent three self-financed &quot;Maroon Years&quot;, 1997 to 2000, at &quot;Cow Pasture&quot;, his now famous and, then, &quot;post-hurricane&quot; home in Barbados. In 1998 he married Beverly Reid, a Jamaican.

In 1992 Brathwaite took up the position of Professor of Comparative Literature at New York University, subsequently dividing his residence between Barbados and New York.

In 1994, Brathwaite was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature for his body of work, nominated by Ghanaian poet and author Kofi Awoonor, edging out other nominees including; Toni Morrison, Norman Mailer, and Chinua Achebe.

In 2002 the University of Sussex presented Kamau Brathwaite with an honorary doctorate.

In 2004, after his retirement from New York University, Brathwaite began chronicling a &quot;Second Time of Salt&quot;, musing on what he deemed a &quot;cultural lynching.&quot;

In 2006, he was the sole person that year to be awarded a Musgrave gold medal by the Institute of Jamaica, with eight silver and bronze medals going to other recipients. In 2010, Brathwaite reported the theft of the medal, as well as other items from his New York City home in the previous four years.

Brathwaite was Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at New York University and resided in Cow Pasture, Barbados.

He died aged 89 on 4 February 2020, and was accorded an official funeral on 21 February.

==Posthumous recognition and legacy==

Shortly before his death, Brathwaite was offered and had accepted the Bocas Henry Swanzy Award for Distinguished Service to Caribbean Letters, presented annually at the NGC Bocas Lit Fest. Announcing that the award, which recognises his contribution as a literary critic, literary activist, editor, and author on topics of Caribbean literature, as well as honouring the year of his 90th birthday, would be presented to his family in Barbados at a ceremony March, Bocas founder and director Marina Salandy-Brown said: &quot;It now seems even more significant to honour him and, in this time of mourning, it is a small consolation to know that news of the award brought Prof Brathwaite pleasure in his final days.&quot;

On 22 October 2020, a commissioned portrait of Brathwaite, painted by Errol Lloyd, was unveiled at his alma mater Pembroke College, Cambridge.

<text>The Daewoo Precision Industries K5 or K5/DP51 series is a 9×19mm semi-automatic pistol produced by SNT Motiv (formerly S&amp;T Daewoo) of South Korea.

The K5 was introduced in 1989. It is recoil operated and uses a conventional Browning-type locking system. It is mostly carried by commissioned officers in the South Korean military.

==Design==
The K5 is a compact, lightweight pistol with an unconventional trigger mechanism called &quot;fast action&quot;. The frame is made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum alloy with a matte anodized finish, while the slide is constructed out of forged 4140 steel with a matte finish. The barrel is made of forged 4150 steel with a (6 grooves) right twist.

The pistol features an unusual &quot;fast action&quot; trigger mechanism which allows the hammer to be decocked while still keeping the mainspring compressed. The &quot;fast action&quot; (also known as Triple Action, and most recently known as Double Action Plus+) mode allows the trigger travel of the double-action mode and the trigger weight of single-action mode. This allows a more accurate first shot due to the lighter weight of the trigger. It is also safer due to the longer trigger travel required to fire the pistol. A light pull on the trigger causes the hammer to flick back, after which the pistol would behave in conventional single-action mode.
The pistol can also be fired in traditional double and single-action modes.

The factory double-column type box magazines hold 13 or 15 rounds for the full size variant or for the compact variant 10 rounds. Smith &amp; Wesson 59-series magazines are known to be compatible with the DP51 but will protrude slightly. The magazine release is of the push button type.

The pistol has three-dot iron sights. The safety consists of an ambidextrous safety external safety and a passive firing pin block which (as its name implies) blocks the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled.

The handgrip panels are made of one piece polymer.

==Commercial sales==

The K5 was marketed commercially in the United States between the early to late 1990s through various importers, including FirstShot, Inc., Kimber of America, Inc., B-West Imports, Inc., and Davidsons, Inc. as the DP51, with a compact version known as the DP51C and S&amp;W caliber version known as the DH40.

It was reintroduced to the U.S. market through collaboration between Daewoo (now SNT Motiv) and Lionheart Industries of Redmond, WA in 2011 as the LH9, LH9C, and LH9 MKII (amongst other variants), featuring numerous updates including a redesigned hammer, wider slide serrations with added serrations to the front of the slide, redesigned grips, Cerakote finish, and optional Picatinny rail (as the MKII).

The internal design and basic functions remain identical to the original and all the parts interchange between the original and the Lionheart variants.

A later variant of the pistol was introduced in 2016 by Lionheart called the REGULUS, chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The REGULUS was made in the United States, not imported, as was the case with prior models of Lionheart pistols. 

The REGULUS built on the LH9 by adding Novak sight cuts, an accessory rail on the dust cover, and an overall change of the pistol&#x27;s aesthetic. In 2019 the REGULUS was re-released by Lionheart&#x27;s new owner when the company moved from Renton, Washington to Winder Georgia. Further refinements were made to the pistol including a redesign of the extractor, redesign of the recoil spring assembly, the addition of G10 grips, and an update to the pistol&#x27;s finish using Cerekote Elite.

<doc id="1137103" wikidata="Q20054573" url="?curid=1137103" title="Keio Flying Squadron">
<text>is a scrolling shooter video game for the Sega/Mega CD. It was developed by Victor Entertainment and first published in Japan in 1993, and later in Europe in 1994, and North America in 1995. Two sequels, &quot;Keio Flying Squadron 2&quot; and &quot;Rami-chan no Ōedo Sugoroku: Keiō Yūgekitai Gaiden&quot;, were released in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

The game refers to Japanese culture, both ancient and modern simultaneously.

==Plot==
The game is set in the Keiō era during the Edo Shogunate period of Japanese history (1865–1868). Rami Nanahikari, a naughty girl in her prime, has been raised from a young age and brought up by her grandparents to be the next Guardian of the Key to the Secret Treasure, known as &quot;Ark&quot;, and is really a descendant of aliens who came to Earth in ancient times. She does not know the importance of the Treasure, and her overbearing grandmother does not remember what secret the Key unlocks. The Key has been stolen (while Rami was at the local convenience store), and now she must get the Key back.

Wearing her bunny girl costume, Rami rides into battle on her trusty dragon, Spot, as she encounters various enemies such as tanuki, dogs, cats, monkeys, the Seven Lucky Gods, the U.S. military forces, the Russian Army, and a serpentine dragon, until she arrives at the ship of Dr. Pon Eho, a tanuki billed as the most intelligent creature on Earth with an IQ of 1400, his appearance being appropriate for the thief that he is.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of Rami riding on top of Spot, who can shoot fireballs at enemies. By earning &quot;Power-Up Items&quot;, the player increases the power of the flames to six different levels. The player can also pick up Sub-Weapons and use either the Ground Bombs, the Explosive Throwing Stars or Homing Spot Jrs. (companion fighters) depending on the type of Sub-Weapon Items available. Normally, Spot Jrs. are for covering Spot; however by pressing the &quot;C&quot; Button, they become powerful bullets projected forward. If surrounded by the enemy, the player can use the Kamikaze Attack, sacrificing the Spot Jrs. to do larger damage, only for them to reappear when Spot ceases to shoot.

==Characters==
Japanese names are given in the Western order, given name first.

*Rami Nanahikari - An alien descendant of Noah and the grandchild of an ancient family with the mission of guarding the Key to the Secret Treasure. Rami wears a traditional kimono at the beginning of the game, and later changes into her bunny suit, the formal attire of a Key Guardian. In the Japanese version of the game she is 12 years old, while in the English versions she is 20 years old. Voiced by Miho Kanno (Japanese); Samantha Paris (English).
*Spot Nanahikari - A dragon who has been serving the Key Guardian Clan and the Nanahikari family as a pet for many generations. Although a bit weak-minded and lazy, he is a fun guy and is always loyal to his owner Rami, having no problems with flying and shooting fireballs. He is called Pochi in the Japanese release of the game. Voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu (Japanese); Samantha Paris (English).
*&quot;Grandma&quot; and &quot;Grandpa&quot; Nanahikari - Rami&#x27;s biological grandparents who have raised her from a young age and brought her up to be the next Key Guardian. They were former Guardians themselves, continuing a long line of ancestors in the Key Guardian Clan that have kept the Treasure safe for many generations. Though they know their duty, they no longer remember the meaning of the Key. Voiced by Keiko Yamamoto (Japanese; Grandma), Yusaku Yara (Japanese; Grandpa); Roger L. Jackson (English; both).
*Dr. Pon Eho - A super intelligent tanuki who stole the Key to the Secret Treasure and knows of its significance. His IQ is 1400. In the Japanese version, he has a speech quirk where he ends most of his sentences with &quot;~tsupe&quot; (～っぺ). This is not present in the English versions. Voiced by Jōji Yanami (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English).
*Seven Lucky Gods - Obedient servants of Dr. Pon, consisting of Fukurokuju, Ebisu, Bishamon, Shōjō, Hotei, Benten and Daikoku.
*Narrator - Voiced by Yusaku Yara (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English).

==Development==
&quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; was made by a small team of developers; director Yasushi Endo, game designer Satoru Honda, programmer Teruhito Yamaki, and composer Tsukasa Tawada, with art and graphics by Hiroshi Ogawa and Hitoshi Kakumu, and character designs by Hiromasa Ota and Takeshi Honda. Since Victor Entertainment was originally a music company before its merge with Nihon AVC, they had been developing products that brought out the potential of CD-ROMs. Most of their previous video games were overseas ports of other games; following the release of the SNES version of &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, the developers all came together to create their first original game.

According to Honda, the developers wanted a story inspired by &quot;Kachi-kachi Yama&quot;, a Japanese folktale about a rabbit and a villainous tanuki. However, he believed that just because a rabbit was the main character did not mean that it had to be an actual rabbit in the game. He chose a bunny girl as the protagonist of the game, naming her Rami Nanahikari, and reducing her breast size in order to fit his vision. He additionally stated that the attire was chosen so that Rami could easily be seen onscreen during gameplay. Rami was also going to have a slightly mature look with longer hair and fishnet stockings (later changed to tights) for her bunny suit, but those ideas were dropped. The developers wanted to make the game more comedic than serious in order to appeal to a wider audience. Due to this, Honda had to create a worldview that fit with the idea. He also wanted it to have a sense of unity, where cute and strange characters could coexist, and be reminiscent of the eve of a festival. He decided to have the game take place in the Edo Shogunate period, feeling that it would be interesting if were set in the past rather than the future. While the first three stages were set in the Edo Shugonate period, the others were set in &quot;parallel worlds&quot;. A robot rabbit named Usagimaru was planned to be included as a Sub-Weapon, but was cut and replaced with the Explosive Throwing Stars.

For the soundtrack, Tawada wanted to make it more extravagant, so he composed some parts of the soundtrack where players could enjoy the music alone, regardless of whether it fit the game. The music also had a strong focus on Japanese sounds. &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; used a Japanese drum-like sound, which had a floor tom sound that was processed to create the effect of two drumsticks being struck with a time lag trigger. The musical instruments used in the game&#x27;s soundtrack were recorded using two Yamaha SY99 FM+PCM tone generation hybrid synthesizers.

The game features animated cutscenes produced by Studio Pierrot. The voices were recorded at Magic Capsule in April 1993, provided by Miho Kanno, Akiko Hiramatsu, Jōji Yanami, Keiko Yamamoto and Yusaku Yara. &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; was Kanno&#x27;s first time voice acting, with her playing the role of Rami, applying for it out of curiosity. Due to this, she was initially nervous about working with the other actors, but quickly got along with everyone and had a fun time recording for the game.

The game has a hidden bonus minigame, &quot;LSI Game Neko&quot; (&quot;Super Catch Game&quot; in the English versions), a parody of vintage LCD games which can be accessed by entering a cheat code on the start/options screen; playing as a cat, the goal is to catch as many of the falling objects as possible.

When &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; was released in Europe and North America, some changes were made:
* A splash screen for the game appears after the Victor/JVC logo in the Japanese and European versions, but was removed from the North American version.
* In the Japanese version, contact with solid terrain is fatal outside of boss fights, and most enemies flash different colors when hit. In the English versions, touching the ground does nothing, and the flashing-colors-when-hit behavior is mostly limited to bosses.
* An animation and title card at the beginning of each stage wherein a tanuki unravels a scroll containing the title was removed.
* Two &quot;tutorials&quot; by Dr. Pon explaining some mechanics and his minions from the first two stages (Tekkannon, a heavy armored chahakobi ningyō machine, and Victor&#x27;s dog mascot Nipper, who rides on a tamati) were removed.
* A few extensive monologues from Rami (with Spot and Grandma) and Dr. Pon before certain stages were cut, with only Rami saying the chapters&#x27; names and saying, &quot;Push to start!&quot; being translated.
* The game&#x27;s title logo was removed from the splash screens for the North American version.
* A cutscene in which Rami and Spot learn about the Secret Treasure&#x27;s whereabouts from the Old Testament in Edo Castle&#x27;s library was removed.
* Rami&#x27;s age was changed from 12 years old to 20 years old.
* Spot&#x27;s gender was changed from male to female.
* The U.S. military forces were renamed the &quot;U.S. Navy&quot;.

The translation and voice recording was done at Watanabe-Robins &amp; Associates, with the voices provided by Samantha Paris and Roger L. Jackson. Paris got the audition for Rami from her agent, went to their office to record it, and was hired for the job. Jackson first trained with Paris at her school Voicetrax before he became a professional voice actor.

==Release==
&quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; was released in Japan on August 6, 1993, in Europe in December 1994, and in North America on February 5, 1995. In the United Kingdom, a playable demo disc for &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; containing the first stage was provided by the &quot;Sega Pro CD&quot; magazine in its December 1994 issue. While the demo ends after the first stage, it is identical to the full version, and the whole game is accessible in the demo disc by using a level select cheat code. JVC also sent out bunny ears with copies of the game.

In July 2020, Limited Run Games CEO Josh Fairhurst stated that he tried to get a rerelease of &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; going, but JVC would not do it without official blessing from Sega.

==Reception==
Upon its release, the game was not commercially successful in Japan, but received critical acclaim, being praised for its graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay. It received mixed-to-positive reviews in the West. However, due to the Sega CD&#x27;s limited success and the game&#x27;s scarce distribution, it did not reach a wide audience initially. Over time, the game has attained a cult following among collectors and retro enthusiasts.

&quot;Sega Pro&quot; scored the Japanese release of the game a 49% in 1993, calling it one of &quot;many mediocre releases on CD&quot;, and stating that it &quot;contains bland and unoriginal ideas that will disappoint most players&quot;. The magazine would give the English version a score of 78% two years later in 1995, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s creepy, it&#x27;s kooky and a perfect introduction to shoot-&#x27;em-ups.&quot; &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; reviewed the game and gave it a score of 82%, calling it &quot;an enjoyable, playable blaster that doesn&#x27;t push the Mega-CD&#x27;s capabilities, but adds a good game to its catalogue&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; scored the game a 42%. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a score of 80%, stating, &quot;&quot;Keio&quot; moves as smoothly as it sounds, so novice players and serious shooters alike will enjoy it.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated, &quot;The game received an extra star because a few bits actually made us laugh, but that&#x27;s it.&quot; &quot;M! Games&quot; reviewed the game, giving it a score of 71 out of 100.

The game has appeared on multiple top lists of Mega CD games. &quot;USgamer&quot; called the game &quot;one of the rarer and more expensive titles for Sega CD&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included it among top ten Mega CD games, calling it &quot;a perfectly acceptable substitute&quot; of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Parodius&quot; that features &quot;similar style of horizontally scrolling wackiness and puts the Mega-CD hardware to good use to produce some excellent cut-scenes and a brilliant CD-quality soundtrack.&quot;

Emily Rodriguez of &quot;Retro Replay&quot; stated, &quot;Revisiting &quot;Keio Flying Squadron&quot; is like rediscovering a piece of my childhood. The game&#x27;s blend of shoot &#x27;em up action, anime aesthetics, and a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack makes it a timeless classic. It&#x27;s a shame that more people didn&#x27;t get to experience it during its initial release.&quot;

<doc id="1137111" wikidata="Q575597" url="?curid=1137111" title="Spherical cap">
<text>In geometry, a spherical cap or spherical dome is a portion of a sphere or of a ball cut off by a plane. It is also a spherical segment of one base, i.e., bounded by a single plane. If the plane passes through the center of the sphere (forming a great circle), so that the height of the cap is equal to the radius of the sphere, the spherical cap is called a &quot;hemisphere&quot;.

==Volume and surface area==
The volume of the spherical cap and the area of the curved surface may be calculated using combinations of
* The radius formula_1 of the sphere
* The radius formula_2 of the base of the cap
* The height formula_3 of the cap
* The polar angle formula_4 between the rays from the center of the sphere to the apex of the cap (the pole) and the edge of the disk forming the base of the cap.

These variables are inter-related through the formulas
formula_5, formula_6, formula_7,
and formula_8.
If formula_9 denotes the latitude in geographic coordinates, then formula_10, and formula_11.

=== Deriving the surface area intuitively from the spherical sector volume ===

Note that aside from the calculus based argument below, the area of the spherical cap may be derived from the volume formula_12 of the spherical sector, by an intuitive argument, as
:formula_13
The intuitive argument is based upon summing the total sector volume from that of infinitesimal triangular pyramids. Utilizing the pyramid (or cone) volume formula of formula_14, where formula_15 is the infinitesimal area of each pyramidal base (located on the surface of the sphere) and formula_16 is the height of each pyramid from its base to its apex (at the center of the sphere). Since each formula_16, in the limit, is constant and equivalent to the radius formula_1 of the sphere, the sum of the infinitesimal pyramidal bases would equal the area of the spherical sector, and: 
:formula_19

===Deriving the volume and surface area using calculus ===

The volume and area formulas may be derived by examining the rotation of the function 
:formula_20 
for formula_21, using the formulas the surface of the rotation for the area and the solid of the revolution for the volume.
The area is
:formula_22
The derivative of formula_23 is
:formula_24
and hence
:formula_25
The formula for the area is therefore
:formula_26
The volume is
:formula_27

==Applications==
===Volumes of union and intersection of two intersecting spheres===

The volume of the union of two intersecting spheres
of radii formula_28 and formula_29 is
:formula_30

where

:formula_31

is the sum of the volumes of the two isolated spheres, and

:formula_32

the sum of the volumes of the two spherical caps forming their intersection. If formula_33 is the
distance between the two sphere centers, elimination of the variables formula_34 and formula_35 leads
to

:formula_36

=== Volume of a spherical cap with a curved base ===

The volume of a spherical cap with a curved base can be calculated by considering two spheres with radii formula_28 and formula_29, separated by some distance formula_39, and for which their surfaces intersect at formula_40. That is, the curvature of the base comes from sphere 2. The volume is thus the difference between sphere 2&#x27;s cap (with height formula_41) and sphere 1&#x27;s cap (with height formula_3),

formula_43

This formula is valid only for configurations that satisfy formula_44 and formula_45. If sphere 2 is very large such that formula_46, hence formula_47 and formula_48, which is the case for a spherical cap with a base that has a negligible curvature, the above equation is equal to the volume of a spherical cap with a flat base, as expected.

=== Areas of intersecting spheres ===

Consider two intersecting spheres of radii formula_28 and formula_29, with their centers separated by distance formula_39. They intersect if

:formula_52

From the law of cosines, the polar angle of the spherical cap on the sphere of radius formula_28 is

:formula_54

Using this, the surface area of the spherical cap on the sphere of radius formula_28 is

:formula_56

=== Surface area bounded by parallel disks ===

The curved surface area of the spherical segment bounded by two parallel disks is the difference of surface areas of their respective spherical caps. For a sphere of radius formula_1, and caps with heights formula_34 and formula_35, the area is

:formula_60

or, using geographic coordinates with latitudes formula_61 and formula_62,

:formula_63

For example, assuming the Earth is a sphere of radius 6371 km, the surface area of the arctic (north of the Arctic Circle, at latitude 66.56° as of August 2016) is = , or = 4.125% of the total surface area of the Earth.

This formula can also be used to demonstrate that half the surface area of the Earth lies between latitudes 30° South and 30° North in a spherical zone which encompasses all of the Tropics.

== Generalizations ==

=== Sections of other solids ===
The spheroidal dome is obtained by sectioning off a portion of a spheroid so that the resulting dome is circularly symmetric (having an axis of rotation), and likewise the ellipsoidal dome is derived from the ellipsoid.

=== Hyperspherical cap ===

Generally, the formula_64-dimensional volume of a hyperspherical cap of height formula_3 and radius formula_1 in formula_64-dimensional Euclidean space is given by:
formula_68
where formula_69 (the gamma function) is given by formula_70.

The formula for formula_71 can be expressed in terms of the volume of the unit n-ball formula_72 and the hypergeometric function formula_73 or the regularized incomplete beta function formula_74 as
formula_75

and the area formula formula_76 can be expressed in terms of the area of the unit n-ball formula_77 as
formula_78
where formula_79.

A. Chudnov derived the following formulas:
formula_80 where 
formula_81
formula_82

For odd formula_83:
formula_84

==== Asymptotics ====

If formula_85 and formula_86, then formula_87 where formula_88 is the integral of the standard normal distribution.

A more quantitative bound is formula_89.
For large caps (that is when formula_90 as formula_91), the bound simplifies to formula_92.

<text>Fenix TX (styled as Fenix*TX) is an American pop punk band. The band originally formed as Riverfenix in 1995 in Houston, Texas. Under that name, they independently released an EP, &quot;G.B.O.H.&quot;, and an album, &quot;Riverfenix&quot;, before having to change their name due to a cease and desist order from the estate of actor River Phoenix. Following the change of name, they signed with major label MCA Records in 1999. On MCA, they released two further albums, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Fenix TX&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Lechuza&quot;, which collectively sold over 600,000 units. The band broke up in 2002 over creative differences.

After the split, bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Damon DeLaPaz devoted themselves to their now defunct side project Sing the Body Electric, while vocalist/guitarist Will Salazar and guitarist Chris Lewis formed the band Denver Harbor. Donnie Reyes went on to join Khobretti.

In September 2005, Fenix TX announced their reunion. They released a live album, &quot;Purple Reign in Blood&quot;, and supported it with tours across the United States and Japan.

==History==
===Early years (1995-1997)===
The band that would ultimately become Fenix TX was formed in late 1995 in Houston, Texas under the name Riverfenix by guitarists Will Salazar and Damon DeLaPaz (also the drummer for 30 Foot Fall at the time), and vocalist Carl Lockstedt. Carl&#x27;s tenure was short-lived after recruiting bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Donnie Reyes. At this point, Salazar was forced to take over vocal duties. With this solidified line-up, the four piece immediately set to work by playing extensively on the Texas pop punk scene alongside such renowned bands as 30 Foot Fall, Good Riddance and Goldfinger. Popular venues included local clubs such as Fitzgerald&#x27;s (whose head of security earned an homage in the Riverfenix song &quot;Skinhead Jessie&quot;). In 1996, the band released their debut EP &quot;G.B.O.H.&quot; under the Houston-based record label Fuzzgun Records, which they then followed by playing the Mullets Across America Tour with Home Grown, Cousin Oliver and The Hippos. During this time the band would also concentrate on distributing copies of their demos to other record labels. Mojo Records showed interest in the band, however, due to procrastination and indecision the process never came to fruition. However, two Mojo interns Richard and Stefanie Reines, were on the brink of starting their own label, Drive-Thru Records, and agreed to sign Riverfenix as their first band.

===Riverfenix/Fenix TX (1997-2000)===

In December 1997, Drive-Thru released Riverfenix&#x27;s thirteen-track full-length debut &quot;Riverfenix&quot;, produced by Jim Barnes. Within the following year, the album managed to sell out its first three print runs of 5,000 copies each, which was quite an achievement for an independent record label operating out of the owners&#x27; garage. The CD&#x27;s lyrics and melodies caught the attention of Blink-182&#x27;s Mark Hoppus, whose sister was at that time dating Riverfenix&#x27;s DeLaPaz. Hoppus offered the band an opening slot on an upcoming Blink-182 tour, and eventually became their manager. However, due to the schedule of his own band and the popularity of Blink-182&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, Hoppus passed managing duties onto Blink-182 manager Rick DeVoe. While Riverfenix&#x27;s song &quot;Speechless&quot; was slowly garnering radio airplay and major labels&#x27; attention, Hoppus&#x27; effort in promoting Riverfenix was overheard by Blink-182&#x27;s record label MCA, who showed major interest in signing the band.

Two obstacles, however, separated Riverfenix from MCA: The band was still under contract with Drive-Thru Records, who were unwilling to compromise. Additionally, the estate of late actor River Phoenix filed a cease and desist order against the band, barring further usage of the name Riverfenix. While Drive-Thru Records and MCA settled for a distribution agreement, the band discarded the &quot;River&quot; from their name and appended Texas&#x27; postal abbreviation. Thus, Riverfenix became Fenix TX. With a new record deal, Fenix TX re-recorded the majority of their 1997 eponymous album for their MCA debut &quot;Fenix TX&quot;, and released it on July 13, 1999. The album debuted at No. 115 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers. The hit single &quot;All My Fault&quot; received heavy radio and TV airplay, triggered through the song&#x27;s integration in the TV movie &quot;Jailbait&quot; (2000), which even featured a cameo appearance by Fenix TX. The music video, in return, starred Alycia Purrott from the cast of &quot;Jailbait&quot;, as well as Blink-182&#x27;s Hoppus. &quot;All My Fault&quot; reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart.

===&quot;Lechuza&quot; and breakup (2000-2002)===

Following the success of their MCA debut, Fenix TX went on numerous tours, including the Warped Tour and both national and international tours with label mates New Found Glory. However, in late 2000, drummer Reyes left the band to pursue other interests. To compensate, DeLaPaz took over drumming duties for the band and a search for a new guitarist commenced. In March 2001, James Love was announced as the replacement guitarist. Simultaneously, the band revealed the name of their follow-up record, &quot;Lechuza&quot;.

&quot;Lechuza&quot; was released on May 22, 2001 and debuted on No. 87 of the Billboard 200, with its single &quot;Threesome&quot; reaching No. 66 on the UK Singles Chart. The album featured a total of eleven songs, all of which were more raucous and energetic than those on the band&#x27;s previous efforts, with occasional escapes into heavy metal-esque guitar distortion paired with screaming vocal patterns. The reason for the change in style was Lewis&#x27; and DeLaPaz&#x27;s constant feelings of disapproval for the band&#x27;s songs, as revealed by Salazar in an interview in late 2002: &quot;[...] for Lechuza the guys were looking for a different direction so they wrote some songs that were way different, like Something Bad&#x27;s Gonna Happen and Pasture of Muppets, just so that they could have some songs that they could, in their words, actually have fun playing onstage.&quot; One of these songs, &quot;Beating a Dead Horse&quot;, explicitly addresses the problems that had arisen within the band.

Eventually, the continuously growing rift between Salazar and the other two founding members caused Love to leave Fenix TX shortly after the release of the album. Dennis Hill of the Southern Californian pop punk band Lefty temporarily filled his place, while a permanent replacement was found in Pivit&#x27;s Chris Lewis (unrelated to bassist Adam Lewis), during a tour with P.O.D. in October 2001. However, he never legally became a member, which ultimately allowed DeLaPaz and Adam Lewis to overrule Salazar in a decision to break up the band. This occurred in the middle of the writing process for what would have become Fenix TX&#x27;s third album. On September 19, 2002, the disbandment of Fenix TX was officially announced, despite Salazar&#x27;s wishes to continue the band.

===Denver Harbor and Sing the Body Electric (2002-2004)===
After the breakup in September 2002, the members of Fenix TX split to form two separate bands: Salazar and Chris Lewis started the post-grunge band Denver Harbor, along with F.O.N. members Aaron and Ilan Rubin. DeLaPaz and Adam Lewis recruited singer Anthony Scalamere, bassist Jason Torbert and ex-Fenix TX guitarist James Love (who was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Tony Montemarano in February 2004) for their experimental/hardcore side-project Big Black Boat. Soon after the formation, the name of the project was changed first to ChChCh HaHaHa and officially became Sing the Body Electric on February 15, 2004.

Denver Harbor released their debut EP &quot;Extended Play&quot; on December 16, 2003 and signed with Universal Records in May 2004. Sing the Body Electric recorded their eponymous six song EP &quot;Sing the Body Electric&quot;, which was released by Restart Records on August 10, 2004, shortly before Denver Harbor&#x27;s second effort, the full-length album &quot;Scenic&quot;, issued on October 12, 2004.

Sing the Body Electric never received major recognition. Singer Anthony Scalamere, who was known for his extreme views on contemporary music—as evidenced by an incident where he bragged about assaulting a person for wearing a Dashboard Confessional T-shirt—clashed with fellow band members. On May 26, 2005, after months of inactivity and a deadlock on Sing the Body Electric&#x27;s website, Scalamere proclaimed the breakup of the band on their message board in a profanity-plastered diatribe that implicated the unreachability of band members as a major factor. The post ended with the words &quot;sing the body is dead&quot;. In response to this, Adam Lewis wrote &quot;Well if Sing The Body Electric is dead, YOU KILLED IT!&quot; Eventually, Adam Lewis formed another band called Sub Rosa based in Los Angeles. Damon DeLaPaz has since formed alternative rock group Demasiado and punk/metal trio Laserwolf and Thunderbolt. He performed with Ape Machine, a rock band from Portland, Oregon, and recorded as a session drummer for various bands and musicians.

===Reunion, hiatus, and second reunion (2004-2016)===
On August 14, 2004, Fenix TX played two reunion shows with their last active line-up (consisting of Salazar, Chris Lewis, Adam Lewis and DeLaPaz) at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California. Both shows were filmed by Drive-Thru Records and slated to be released on DVD format, along with a CD of previously unreleased material. Due to reasons unknown, neither the DVD nor the CD have been released . However, the band reunited again exactly one year later to record a live album at The Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona, which was released under the title &quot;Purple Reign in Blood – Live&quot; on November 8, 2005.

To coincide with the new release, Fenix TX announced two farewell tours — the Before the Blackout, After the Breakup Tour in the United States, and the Drive-Thru Invasion Tour 2006 in Japan — running from October 7, 2005 until January 15, 2006. Salazar&#x27;s and Chris Lewis&#x27; other band Denver Harbor supported them on the U.S. tour, which meant that both members were required to perform two sets every night. This, and repeating logistics problems, led to many dates being cancelled on the day they were scheduled. Also, halfway through the tour, DeLaPaz was asked to leave, so Ilan Rubin from Denver Harbor replaced him for the remainder of the tour.

In February 2006, the band played another three shows with No Use for a Name before heading out on a two-week tour with Unwritten Law in the beginning of March. A European tour supported by Pensive — including England, Scotland, France, and Italy — was scheduled to take place in May 2006. However, due to Salazar developing polyps on his vocal folds, the tour was cancelled.

In April 2006, it was officially announced that Ilan Rubin replaced DeLaPaz on drums, and that Fenix TX would record their follow-up to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Lechuza&quot;. Beginning on April 29, 2006 at Give It a Name, Rubin also played drums for Lostprophets. Though he has since continued to be their drummer and recorded several tracks for 2006&#x27;s &quot;Liberation Transmission&quot;, as well as its successor. He was the drummer for Nine Inch Nails, but since has joined Angels &amp; Airwaves.

On August 14, 2009 (the five-year anniversary of the first Fenix*Tx reunion) it was announced via Fenix Tx&#x27;s Myspace that the original RiverFenix line-up was reuniting to begin working on new music for release sometime in 2010. However, the band later stated that the announcement of the original lineup reuniting was a mistake, and that they were reuniting with a different lineup. They went on a European tour in October 2010. Fenix Tx released three new tracks &quot;Bending Over Backwards&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Nothing Seems Bigger Than This&quot; for their soundcloud on January 4, 2012. Fenix Tx&#x27;s new song &quot;Spooky Action At a Distance&quot; was featured in &quot;MLB 13: The Show&quot;.

===&quot;CRE.EP&quot; (2016-2021)===
On March 22, 2016 Donnie Reyes joined the original lineup in Houston, for a performance at the Continental Club.

On April 4, 2016, it was confirmed that Fenix TX had signed to Cyber Tracks, the Los Angeles based record label owned by NOFX guitarist El Hefe and his wife Jen Abeyta. The five track EP &quot;CRE.EP&quot; was released on September 30, 2016.

On June 9, 2018, Fenix TX reported that Will Salazar would not be performing with the band during their two scheduled dates of the 2018 Warped Tour. The band reported that Salazar was still a member of the band and that &quot;it just didn&#x27;t work out.&quot; 

On September 21, 2021, the band reported via social media that Adam Lewis had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

===New vocalist and recent activity (2022–present)===
On October 11, 2022, the band was listed as a part of the lineup for When We Were Young 2023. 

In February 2023, Reddit circulated rumors that Salazar had been removed from the band&#x27;s publicity and was no longer performing with them. 

On September 8, 2023, the band reported that they had recruited Scott McLaughlin (With Confidence, Unwritten Law) as the vocalist for their upcoming performances at the House of Blues and the 2023 When We Were Young festival. Per the Facebook announcement, Salazar was working on his own projects and would not be a part of the band, and that new material was being written.

On June 11, 2024, it was announced that Adam Lewis had died from pancreatic cancer. He was 45.

On January 20, 2025, the band released a new single titled &quot;Engines&quot;.

== Musical style and critical reception ==

During the first years of their career, Fenix TX had difficulty escaping the accusations of being a Blink-182 clone, with &quot;The Daily Athenaeum&quot; referring to their 1999 sophomore album, &quot;Fenix TX&quot;, as &quot;a very good Blink-182 album&quot;. However, compared to Blink-182&#x27;s more basic instrumentation, Fenix TX is characterized by more complex guitar accompaniments, due to their TX&#x27;s dual guitar employment, as well as integrating other instruments, such as trombone and trumpet, and as unconventional vocal techniques into their sound. This allowed the band to touch upon other music genres such as ska punk and hip hop, as heard in the songs &quot;Skinhead Jessie&quot; and &quot;Apple Pie Cowboy Toothpaste&quot;. The latter includes a rap originally appearing in the 1984 comedy film &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;. However, the Fenix TX songs usually features a distortion guitar-driven sound, paired with fast-paced but melodic vocal patterns. Lyrics are conventionally a mix of political, personal, and occasionally comedic topics, as heard in the songs &quot;Minimum Wage&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, and &quot;Rooster Song&quot;, respectively.

For Fenix TX&#x27;s second recording effort, the quartet tried to distinguish themselves from its peers. The resulting album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Lechuza&quot;, was split into two parts, with half of the songs written by Salazar and the other half written by Lewis and DeLaPaz. This organization resulted in a slight shift in musical style. Though a tad edgier than before, Salazar&#x27;s songs were largely in the vein of Fenix TX&#x27;s previous material, featuring at times comical, romantic and generally positive themes combined with the band&#x27;s traditional sound. Lewis&#x27; and DeLaPaz&#x27; songs, on the other hand, were musically far more metal and hardcore-influenced and commonly featured gang vocals and more aggressive lyrics. While songs such as &quot;Something Bad Is Gonna Happen&quot; stand out with a very crisp lead guitar sound and a high-pitched guitar solo by James Love, &quot;Beating a Dead Horse&quot; (the only Fenix TX song primarily sung by Adam Lewis) contains screamed vocals and an overall hardcore feel.

Due to this stylistic disparity, &quot;Lechuza&quot; was not as well received by fans and critics as &quot;Fenix TX&quot;. In particular, the band&#x27;s attempt at composing a hardcore song (&quot;Beating a Dead Horse&quot;) elicited a great amount of criticism. In addition to the album, the band&#x27;s live performances were largely discredited for their leanings towards alternative metal, rather than a pop punk style. Yet, the loyalty of many fans outweighed the disappointment over the album, though a third full-length effort by Fenix TX would have continued in a harder direction, as the member&#x27;s post-breakup projects featured material that was originally intended for the follow-up to &quot;Lechuza&quot;.

<text>The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute is a museum and research institute located on the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton in eastern Oregon. It is the only Native American museum along the Oregon Trail. The institute is dedicated to the culture of the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla tribes of Native Americans. The main permanent exhibition of the museum provides a history of the culture of three tribes, and of the reservation itself. The museum also has a second hall for temporary exhibitions of specific types of Native American art, craftwork, history, and folklore related to the tribes.

==History==
The widely celebrated Oregon Trail sesquicentennial in 1993 served as a platform for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation to present their vision for the future, and convey their interpretation of the past. The original proposal for the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute site detailed a $13 million Oregon Trail interpretive center that would “tell the story of the Oregon Trail from a Native American perspective,” and be an economic and cultural stimulus. The Tribes anticipated the interpretive center to increase local investments and create “more than 800 full-time jobs.” The initial funding strategy included federal funds, local fund raising, grants, video poker profits, and “the commitment of timber from the U.S. Forest Service,” in constructing the interpretive center. After three years of lobbying, the Confederated Tribes were denied federal funding on the basis that the Interior Department’s budget did not &quot;include any money for Indian interpretive centers.” Shortly after the decision, the Oregon Legislature allocated a minimum of “$666,000 in lottery funds” to the construction of the Oregon Trail Interpretive center.

The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation presented a living history exhibit during the summer of 1993 at Fallen Field, in order to share Native American history and culture that predated the Oregon Trail. On August 12, 1993, “the Oregon Trail Sesquicentennial wagon train was stopped by Indians on horseback at the east boundary of the Umatilla Indian Reservation,” in order to draw attention to the lack of federal funding for the Tribes’ Oregon Trail interpretive center. Antone Minthorn, the chairman of the General Council for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, spoke to those on the Wagon Train and the gathered crowd. In his speech, he noted that the Tribes “raised more than $4 million – more than the three companion trail projects in Baker City, The Dalles and Oregon City combined,” all of which received federal funding. Minthorn’s speech focused on the importance of the proposed interpretive center to the Tribes and surrounding area:

Our vision was to create an interpretive center, telling the Tribes’ story to visitors from all over the world. This vision calls for not only exhibits, but also for an on-going center of learning and research for Indians and non-Indians for all time ... It is difficult to overstate the importance of this project to both the Tribe and this region as a whole. The Umatilla Tribes currently are attempting to deal with an unemployment rate of 28 per cent, and an average annual income of $8,000.

Minthorn’s symbolic protest called for “nation-wide support” in presenting “a different perspective of Manifest Destiny.”

In December 1993, the plans for the circular interpretive center were unveiled. Created by exhibit designer Jean Jacques Andre, the permanent exhibit planned to “focus on the Tribes before the white man’s arrival, the current reservation and the tribe’s vision for the future,” and include a section on the Oregon Trail “and its impacts on the tribal way of life.” The original funding strategy evolved to include private funding, and the Tribes used illustrated plans for the interpretive center to increase support.

In May 1994, Representative Bob Smith endorsed the interpretive center, and testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior “in support of a $2 million request for the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.” Community support efforts continued, and on September 14, 1994, the &quot;East Oregonian&quot; printed a full page description of the Tamustalik Cultural Institute, which included sketches and contribution information. The same month, a “$6.5 million loan guarantee by the Bureau of Indian Affairs” provided the financial backing the Tribes needed to move forward on construction.
On June 9, 1995, a ground-breaking ceremony was held for the Tamustalik Cultural Institute, which was attended by over 300 people. As reported by the &quot;Confederated Umatilla Journal&quot;, the ceremony “was performed by Tribal elders and students from the Tribes’ Head Start Preschool Program. Special drums were made for the boys, who were led in a song by Jay Minthorn. The girls broke ground with miniature root diggers, made especially for the occasion.” The building site was later prepared by the Oregon National Guard. Roberta Conner was announced as the first director of Tamástslikt Cultural Institute in February of 1998, and oversaw the final preparations of the institute. After ten years of planning, a “special opening ceremony was held July 24 for the tribal community, which then had a week to explore its new facility before the doors opened to the public July 31.” Within the first three weeks of opening, approximately 4,000 people visited the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute.

==Naming==
The site was initially to be named The Oregon Trail on the Umatilla Indian Reservation Interpretive Institute. Tribal elders deliberated, and decided a shorter name would be more practical. The name Tamásclikt, from the Walla Walla North East Sahaptin dialect, was suggested by Átway Celia Bearchum.

Tamásclik, a verb, means to “turn over,” as in the turning of the seasons, or years. The English spelling is Tamástslik, and the addition of a ‘t’ to the end changes the word from a verb to a name. Linguist Dr. Noel Rude made an orthographic correction to the name. The final product was the name Tamástslikt (Tuh-must-slickt), which means “interpreting our own story.”

==Mission==
The mission of the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute is “To preserve and perpetuate the diverse cultures and histories of the indigenous people now known as the Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla Tribes,” and “To educate people about our cultures, histories and contemporary lives.”

==Facilities==
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute is a 45,000 square foot building constructed with “native stone and wood.” The institute includes 15,000 square feet of permanent and temporary exhibit space. Additional on-site facilities include archive vaults, the Research Library, the Museum Store, the Kinship Café, and designated meeting areas.

===Meeting areas===
There are five designated meeting areas accessible by the public within the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute: the Gallery, the Classroom (694 usable square feet), the Conference Room (305 usable square feet), the Multipurpose Theater (1600 usable square feet), and the Celilo Lobby (2300 usable square feet). The Coyote Theater projects a short gallery introduction which is led by the guide “Spilyáy, the magical coyote.” The Celilo Lobby is &quot;a basalt-lined circular lobby featuring a floor-to-ceiling mural of Celilo Falls.&quot;

==Collections==
In 2003, the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute had “more than 2,500 artifacts in its collection area,&quot; which are stored in multiple vaults and the Research Library. In 2011, Tamástslikt Cultural Institute added &quot;five artifact donations and 220 books to the collection&quot; and received &quot;Dr. Theodore Stern archival materials on long-term loan from University of Oregon Special Collections.&quot; Collections include baskets, lithics, regalia, glass plates, audio and video recordings, local and tribal newspapers, genealogical and obituary records on tribal members, papers, books, historic and contemporary photographs, and modern artwork and beadwork from community members.

==Exhibits==

===Permanent exhibits===
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute displays three permanent interconnected exhibits: “We Were,” “We Are,” and “We Will Be.” The guide introduced in the Coyote Theater, Spilyáy, is present throughout each exhibit, and progresses the historical storyline. In “We Were,” the “Seasonal Round” displays pre-contact artifacts. Additional displays feature a winter lodge, traditional regalia, artwork, and “a recreation of the 1855 Treaty Council of Walla Walla in the tribal language. The exhibits include “interactive multi-media presentations, horse dioramas, plus replicas of a boarding school and a church.”

“We Are” displays tribal people “as soldiers and warriors, players in tribal government and the economy, leaders in salmon recovery success, balancing the modern with tradition, and still abiding by the Law of the Salmon.”

“We Will Be” displays the future “visions, hopes and concerns” of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

===Temporary exhibits===
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute houses a temporary exhibition gallery that hosts a variety of exhibits relating to Native American history and culture. These exhibits include the work of organizations and guest artists. In 2011, &quot;Twenty-nine community partners helped stage exhibits and programs for the general public.&quot;

====Current exhibits====

==Special events==
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute holds Kids Day Camps, Craft Lessons, a Community Academy, Kids Powwows, and other special events on a seasonal basis. Tamástslikt also frequently hosts guest lectures that range from related museum work to sustainability and economics.

==Conservation and sustainability==
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute participates in conservation efforts and strives for sustainability. Early in 2011, the Kinship Café “renounced Styrofoam” and committed to the use of biodegradable containers. Past improvements to the facility include the sealing of soffit vents, the installation of energy usage monitors, energy efficient lighting, and motion-activated fixtures, and the decentralization of large boilers. During the ten-year span from 2003 to 2013, the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute “successfully reduced electrical usage by 55% and natural gas usage by 75%.”

Tamástslikt Cultural Institute subscribes to the triple bottom line, or “people, planet, and profit” approach put forth by John Elkington.

===Wind turbine===
A 50 kilowatt wind turbine is to be constructed in 2013. The turbine will be funded by “grant money from Pacific Power’s Blue Sky Fund and Oregon’s wind energy incentives,” and “will be congruent with Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation wind policy – which is against wind farms but for wind power.”

==Museum governance==
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute is &quot;tribally owned and operated&quot; by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, which totaled 2,860 enrolled members at the close of 2011.

==Collaborations and auxiliary projects==

===National Park Service===
The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute “collaborated with the National Park Service and their contractors on new film projects for Whitman Mission National Historic Site, Nez Perce National Historic Park, and Big Hole National Battlefield,” and “began agreement to provide long term storage for Frenchtown Historic Site artifacts” in 2011.

===Homeland Heritage Oregon Trail maps===
The Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla Homeland Heritage Corridor map was developed by the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute. The institute published 300,000 maps in 2011.

===Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation===
In conjunction with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute is contributing to efforts to rename Oregon places containing the word “squaw” with indigenous names.

==Reciprocal partnerships==
In 2005, the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute “entered into reciprocal membership agreements” with the Oregon Historical Society and Washington State Historical Society, which extends “free admission to their museums for members of any one of the respective institutions.” This agreement was made in honor of the Lewis and Clark bicentennial and Walla Walla Treaty Council sesquicentennial. The museums collaborated previously in 2001 to develop a Dale Chihuly exhibit, and participated in artifact loans.

<doc id="1137140" wikidata="Q607965" url="?curid=1137140" title="Serie C">
<text>The Serie C (), officially known as Serie C NOW for sponsorship purposes, is the third-highest division in the Italian football league system after the Serie B and Serie A. The Lega Italiana Calcio Professionistico (Lega Pro) is the governing body that operates the Serie C.

The unification of the Lega Pro Prima Divisione and the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as Lega Pro Divisione Unica (often also abbreviated as Lega Pro) in 2014 reintroduced the format of the original Serie C that existed between 1935 and 1978 (before the split into Serie C1 and Serie C2). In May 2017, the Lega Pro assembly unanimously approved renaming the competition to its original name, Serie C.

==History==
A third division above the regional leagues was first created in Italy in 1926, when fascist authorities decided to reform the major championships on a national basis, increasing the number of teams participating by promoting many regional teams from the Third Division (Terza Divisione) to the Second Division (Seconda Divisione).

A new league running this Second Division, the &quot;Direttorio Divisioni Inferiori Nord&quot; (Northern Directory of Lower Divisions) was set up in Genoa, while football activity in the southern part of the country was run by the &quot;Direttorio Divisioni Inferiori Sud&quot; which later became the &quot;Direttorio Meridionale&quot; (Southern Directory). These leagues did not last long; after another reform they were disbanded between 1930 and 1931. Some bigger clubs who owned large pitches with dimensions of 100x60 metres were promoted to the First Division (Prima Divisione); a league defined and structured as the &quot;National Championship&quot;.

The Second Division had no relegations to regional leagues as most teams were reelected at the beginning of each new season. Once a critical threshold was reached the Italian federation decided to close the two leagues and move all teams to the &quot;Direttori Regionali&quot; (Regional Committees) so that the labour-intensive job of organisation was delegated to more efficient and organised regional staff.

The most successful teams coming from the Second Divisions in 5 years (from 1926–27 to 1930–31) composed 6 ever-growing sections of the First Division (Prima Divisione) which at the beginning had just a few teams in just one section from southern Italy.

This championship was organized by the same league governing Serie A and Serie B (the &quot;Direttorio Divisioni Superiori&quot;), even if, as opposed to the two higher divisions, it was structured in local groups with geographical criteria. The number of clubs belonging to the Prima Divisione continued to increase every year, until FIGC decided to rename it &quot;Serie C&quot; (at the beginning of the 1935–36 season) while a subsequent large reduction in 1948 led to the creation of a sole national division in 1952–53.

The reform that created the actual league was decided by Bruno Zauli in 1959 as he built on the incomplete work started by the former president Ottorino Barassi to make professional football fully recognised and organised. While Lega Calcio had a stated mission of organising professional and national divisions, the new &quot;Lega Nazionale Semiprofessionisti&quot; based in Florence had to regulate the two semiprofessional and subnational divisions: &quot;Serie C&quot; and &quot;Serie D&quot;, with the first one adopting a format of three groups of 20 teams each. In 1978 the semiprofessional sector was abolished; Serie D became an amateur section while Serie C was divided into two professional divisions (&quot;Serie C1&quot; and &quot;Serie C2&quot;), and the league changed its name to &quot;Lega Professionisti Serie C&quot;. On 20 June 2008, the league was restructured and took its current name &quot;Lega Italiana Calcio Professionistico&quot;.

After the league reform of 2014, the two previous divisions of Lega Pro Prima Divisione and Lega Pro Seconda Divisione were ultimately merged into a new league; the &quot;Lega Pro Divisione Unica&quot; or more informally addressed as just &quot;Lega Pro&quot;. This is the league structure currently in operation; comprising 60 teams that are divided geographically in three groups of 20 each. At the end of each season, four teams are promoted to Serie B (three group winners, plus one coming from a promotion playoff involving the three group runners-up). Meanwhile, nine teams are relegated to Serie D: the last-placed team from each group go down directly, whereas teams between 16th and 19th from each group place play a relegation playoff (officially referred to as &quot;play-out&quot;), with the two losing teams from each group also relegated.

In May 2017, the Lega Pro assembly unanimously approved the return to the original name Serie C. The 2017–18 Serie C season includes 19 teams in each of the three divisions after adjustments were made for excluded clubs.

==Format==
Serie C is composed of 60 teams divided equally into three groups split horizontally in geographical terms, from north to south. During the regular season, teams play in a round-robin format solely within their group, with the two halves of the season having exactly the same order of fixtures. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. At the end of the regular season one table per group is determined, based on points. If two or more teams are tied on points, the following tie-breaking criteria apply:
# Head-to-head points; 
# Head-to-head goal difference; 
# Goal difference; 
# Goals scored; 
# Lower goals against; 
# Wins; 
# Lower losses; 
# Away wins; 
# Lower home losses.
A total of 4 teams are promoted to Serie B and 9 teams are relegated to Serie D. The winner team of each group is directly promoted and qualifies for Supercoppa di Serie C. Teams which have finished in the bottom of the league are directly relegated. The other divisional changes are determined through a complex system of promotion and relegation play-offs.

===Promotion play-offs===

28 teams compete to achieve the only available spot for Serie B. 27 of them are the teams which have finished in the 2nd to 10th positions (9 per group). The 28th team is the winner of Coppa Italia Serie C. There are a total of six rounds:
* &quot;First round&quot;. Fixtures pair the 5th v 10th, 6th v 9th and 7th v 8th-placed teams;
* &quot;Second round&quot;. Fixtures pair the 4th v the worst-placed team and the best-placed team v the 2nd best-placed team from the previous round.
&quot;First round&quot; and &quot;Second round&quot; consist in single-leg games and, if teams are tied after regular time, the higher-placed team advances. 6 teams (2 per group) advance to the next round.
* &quot;Third round&quot;. The three 3rd-placed teams, Coppa Italia Serie C winner and the best-placed team from the previous round are seeded. Fixtures are drawn;
* &quot;Quarter-finals&quot;. The three 2nd-placed teams and the best-placed team from the previous round are seeded. Fixtures are drawn.
&quot;Third round&quot; and &quot;Quarter-finals&quot; consist in two-legged games, with seeded team playing at home for second leg, and, if teams are tied on aggregate, the seeded team advances. 
The four winning teams reach the &quot;Final four&quot;, composed of:
* &quot;Semi-finals&quot;;
* &quot;Final&quot;.
&quot;Final four&quot; fixtures are drawn, all games are two-legged and, if teams are tied on aggregate, the winner is decided by extra-time and a penalty shootout if required.

In order to determine the &quot;best-placed team&quot;, the following criteria apply:
# League position;
# Points;
# Wins;
# Goals scored;
# Draw.

If the winner of Coppa Italia Serie C:
# finishes in the top three, qualifies for the relegation play-offs, is relegated directly, or just declines to participate, its spot goes to the runners-up or, subordinately, if they meet the same requirements, to the 4th-placed team playing in the same group as the winner. Thus, the 5th-placed team advances automatically to the &quot;Second round&quot; and faces the worst-placed team from the &quot;First round&quot;, whose fixtures now pair the 6th v 11th, 7th v 10th and 8th v 9th-placed teams;
# finishes in the 4th to 10th positions, the 11th-placed team playing in the same group qualifies for the &quot;First round&quot;. Fixtures of the &quot;First round&quot; and &quot;Second round&quot; still respect the order of the seven participating teams as seen before, with the best-placed team (that can be the 4th or 5th-placed team if Coppa Italia Serie C winner finished 4th) entering the &quot;Second round&quot; and facing the worst-placed team among the other six which play the &quot;First round&quot;;
# gives its spot to the runners-up and they finish in the 4th to 10th positions, the 11th-placed team playing in the same group as the runners-up qualifies for the &quot;First round&quot; (for fixtures see the point 2).

===Relegation &quot;play-outs&quot;===
The number of teams which play the so called &quot;play-out&quot; in the Italian football is variable. Usually, fixtures pair the 16th v 19th and 17th vs 18th-placed teams. Matches are two-legged, the higher-placed team plays at home for second leg and, if teams are tied on aggregate, the lower-placed team is relegated to Serie D. However, if the higher-placed team finishes 9 or more points ahead of the lower-placed team, &quot;play-out&quot; is canceled and team is relegated directly.

==Homegrown players==
To encourage the development of homegrown players, all Lega Pro clubs were capped to use no more than 16 players in their squads that were older than 23 years of age (in 2019–20 season, player born before 1 January 1997), plus two wildcards for long serving players of the clubs. The clubs could use an unlimited number of under-23 players.

<text>Lega Pro Prima Divisione was the third highest football league in Italy. It consisted of 33 teams, divided geographically into two divisions of 16 and 17 teams for group A and B respectively. Until 2008 it was known as Serie C1.

Before the 1978–79 season there were only three leagues of professional football in Italy, the third being Serie C. In 1978, it was decided to split Serie C into Serie C1 and Serie C2. Serie C2, the fourth highest professional league in the Italian system, was also renamed in 2008 and was called Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
The reform, already decided by the FIGC led to the reunification with the second division starting from 2014-2015 and with the subsequent rebirth of the third division championship organized by the pro league with 60 teams divided into three groups of 20 in Lega Pro.

==Promotion and relegation==
In each division, two teams were promoted to Serie B, and three teams were relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In total, the league promoted 4 teams to Serie B and relegated 6 teams to Seconda Divisione.

The team finishing first in the regular season was directly promoted to Serie B, while teams placing 2nd to 5th were entered into a play-off semi-final for the chance of gaining the second promotional spot for that particular division.

<text>Lega Pro Seconda Divisione was the fourth highest football league in Italy, the lowest with a professional status. Usually it consisted of 36 teams, but in the 2011–12 season, there were 41 teams divided geographically into two divisions of 20 and 21. Group A covered northern and north-central Italy, Group B south-central and southern Italy. 

Until the 2007–08 season, the league was known as Serie C2. 

Before the 1978–79 season, there were only three professional football leagues in Italy, the third being Serie C. In 1978, it was decided to split Serie C into Serie C1 (the third highest league) and Serie C2. Upon its inception in 1978–79, Serie C2 consisted of four divisions, however, that number was reduced to three from the start of the 1991–92 season. The reform, already decided by the FIGC lead to the reunification with the first division starting from 2014–15 and with the subsequent rebirth of the third tier championship organized by the pro league with 60 teams divided into three groups of 20 in Lega Pro.

During the regular season, teams only played the other teams in their division. Each opponent was played twice, once at home, and once away, for a total of 34 matches. Games were scheduled such that in the first 17 matches, every opponent was played once. In the last 17 matches, the same opponents were played in the same order, with the only difference being that the venue changed.

<doc id="1137144" wikidata="Q4067124" url="?curid=1137144" title="Antisense therapy">
<text>Antisense therapy is a form of treatment that uses antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to target messenger RNA (mRNA). ASOs are capable of altering mRNA expression through a variety of mechanisms, including ribonuclease H mediated decay of the pre-mRNA, direct steric blockage, and exon content modulation through splicing site binding on pre-mRNA. Several ASOs have been approved in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere.

== Nomenclature ==
The common stem for antisense oligonucleotides drugs is -rsen. The substem -virsen designates antiviral antisense oligonucleotides.

== Antisense Oligonucleotide Development ==

Developments in ASO modification are separated into three generations. Generation one is called backbone-modified and focuses on the phosphodiester group of the nucleotide. This impacts inter-nucleotide binding. These modifications led to better distribution, reduced urinary excretion, and prolonged residence time of the ASOs in the cell. Some examples of first generation modifications include the addition of a phosphorothioate group (PS), methyl group, or nitrogen. The most common is the phosphorothioate group (PS) in which the oxygen atoms of a phosphodiester group are replaced with sulfur atoms, greatly improving efficacy and reducing degradation. Generation two is sugar-modified, focused on the ribose sugar of the nucleotide. This generation saw improved binding affinity while reducing degradation. Some examples of generation two modifications are the substitution of R group with morpholine group (MO) and the usage of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) and thiomorpholine oligomer (TMO) as linkages between the ribose sugar and phosphodiester group in the backbone. Generation three is nucleobase-modified, the least common type of modification. These modifications enhanced binding affinity and cell penetration while reducing degradation and off-target effects. Examples include the introduction of G-clamps, pseudoisocytosine, and the substitution of bases with amine, thione, halogen, alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl groups. 

== Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ==

=== Half-life and stability ===
ASO-based drugs employ highly modified, single-stranded chains of synthetic nucleic acids that achieve wide tissue distribution with very long half-lives. For instance, many ASO-based drugs contain phosphorothioate substitutions and 2&#x27; sugar modifications to inhibit nuclease degradation enabling vehicle-free delivery to cells.

=== &quot;In vivo&quot; delivery ===
Phosphorothioate ASOs can be delivered to cells without the need of a delivery vehicle. ASOs do not penetrate the blood brain barrier when delivered systemically but they can distribute across the neuraxis if injected in the cerebrospinal fluid typically by intrathecal administration. Newer formulations using conjugated ligands greatly enhances delivery efficiency and cell-type specific targeting.

==Approved therapies==

=== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ===
Tofersen (marketed as Qalsody) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of SOD1- associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2023. It was developed by Biogen under a licensing agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. In trials the drug was found to lower levels of an ALS biomarker, neurofilament light change, and in long-term trial extensions to slow disease. Under the terms of the FDA&#x27;s accelerated approval program, a confirmatory study will be conducted in presymptomatic gene carriers to provide additional evidence.

=== Batten disease ===
Milasen is a novel individualized therapeutic agent that was designed and approved by the FDA for the treatment of Batten disease. This therapy serves as an example of personalized medicine.

In 2019, a report was published detailing the development of milasen, an antisense oligonucleotide drug for Batten disease, under an expanded-access investigational clinical protocol authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Milasen &quot;itself remains an investigational drug, and it is not suited for the treatment of other patients with Batten&#x27;s disease&quot; because it was customized for a single patient&#x27;s specific mutation. However it is an example of individualized genomic medicine therapeutical intervention.

===Cytomegalovirus retinitis===
Fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene), was approved by the U.S. FDA in August 1998, as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis.

=== Duchenne muscular dystrophy ===
Several morpholino oligos have been approved to treat specific groups of mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In September 2016, eteplirsen (ExonDys51) received FDA approval for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 51 of the dystrophin transcript. In December 2019, golodirsen (Vyondys 53) received FDA approval for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript. In August 2020, viltolarsen (Viltepso) received FDA approval for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript.

===Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome===
Volanesorsen was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of familial chylomicronaemia syndrome in May 2019.

===Familial hypercholesterolemia===
In January 2013 mipomersen (marketed as Kynamro) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
===Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis===
Inotersen received FDA approval for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in October 2018. The application for inotersen was granted orphan drug designation. It was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and licensed to Akcea Therapeutics. Patisiran (sold under Onpattro) was developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, and also approved for use in the US and EU in 2018 with orphan drug designation. Its mechanism-of-action is the active substance of small interfering RNA (siRNA), which allows it to interfere with and block the production of trasnthyretin. As such, it was the first FDA-approved siRNA therapeutic.

===Spinal muscular atrophy===
In 2004, development of an antisense therapy for spinal muscular atrophy began. Over the following years, an antisense oligonucleotide later named nusinersen was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals under a licensing agreement with Biogen. In December 2016, nusinersen received regulatory approval from FDA and soon after, from other regulatory agencies worldwide.

==Investigational therapies==

=== Current clinical trials ===
As of 2020 more than 50 antisense oligonucleotides were in clinical trials, including over 25 in advanced clinical trials (phase II or III).

==== Phase III trials ====

===== Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis =====
A follow-on drug to Inotersen is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and under license to Akcea Therapeutics for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. In this formulation the ASO is conjugated to N-Acetylgalactosamine enabling hepatocyte-specific delivery, greatly reducing dose requirements and side effect profile while increasing the level of transthyretin reduction in patients.

===== Huntington&#x27;s disease =====
Tominersen (also known as IONIS-HTTRx and RG6042) was tested in a phase 3 trial for Huntington&#x27;s disease although this trial was discontinued on March 21, 2021, due to lack of efficacy. It is currently licensed to Roche by Ionis Pharmaceuticals.

==== Phase I and II trials ====
Clinical trials are ongoing for several diseases and conditions including:

Acromegaly, age related macular degeneration, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, beta thalassemia, cardiovascular disease, elevated level of lipoprotein(a), centronuclear myopathy, coagulopathies, cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, diabetes, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica, familial chylomicronemia syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy, hepatitis B, hereditary angioedema, hypertension, IgA nephropathy, Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy, multiple system atrophy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, prostate cancer, Stargardt disease, STAT3-expressing cancers, Usher syndrome.

=== Preclinical development ===
Several ASOs are currently being investigated in disease models for Alexander disease, ATXN2 (gene) and FUS (gene) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, Lafora disease, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myotonic dystrophy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease, and prion disease, Rett syndrome, spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.

<doc id="1137159" wikidata="Q3846256" url="?curid=1137159" title="Izabella Poniatowska">
<text>Countess Izabella Poniatowska (1 July 1730 – 14 February 1808) was a Polish noblewoman, sister of king Stanisław August Poniatowski.

==Life==
She was the daughter of Stanisław Poniatowski and Konstancja Czartoryska. She was reportedly close to her brother Stanisław during their childhood.

On 19 November 1748 she married Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. The marriage was arranged to give the Czartoryska-Poniatowski family political party an ally in her spouse, and she was expected by her family to influence him. However, her spouse was indifferent to her, and she left him to live with the Masovian voivode Andrzej Mokronowski, whom she eventually married. This was a time of difficulty for her, as she was exposed to conflict with her family and her elopement was treated a scandal.

===Sister of the King===
In 1763, her brother was elected king of Poland.

She was described as her brother&#x27;s close confidante and friend, and her relationship with him is described as sentimental and tender, but she was said to lack any understanding of - or interest - in political issues. In 1769, she advised the king to ally with France in order to be given a secure future with an allowance if he should be deposed by the Bar Confederation. Her brother the king granted her Moscow, Bielsko and Krosno as &quot;starosti&quot; for her personal income. She lived a life in comfort and had a private Italian orchestra, theater and ballet, and spent the winters in Warsaw and the summers in Bialystok. She was called pretty but not intelligent, and her receptions was visited by foreign travelers and diplomats. In Bialystok, she introduced several social inventions such as schools and hospitals.

She was included in the circle of advisers of her brother, and supported the career of Joachim Chreptowicz. She and her sister Ludwika Maria Poniatowska both opposed her brother&#x27;s suggested marriage to princess Sophia Albertina of Sweden. In 1783, she visited France with her husband. In 1784, she was widowed a second time.

She stayed with her brother the King in Warsaw all through the Kościuszko Uprising to support him, despite being afraid, and the first shots during the revolution is said to have been fired near her palace. She supported Stanisław Mokronowski during the uprising, but advised her brother not to endanger his safety. She followed her brother on his exile to Grodno.

<doc id="1137166" wikidata="Q3398453" url="?curid=1137166" title="Concealed carry in the United States">
<text>Concealed carry, or carrying a concealed weapon (CCW), is the practice of carrying a weapon (such as a handgun) in public in a concealed manner, either on one&#x27;s person or in close proximity. CCW is often practiced as a means of self-defense. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;NYSRPA v. Bruen&quot; (2022) decision, all states in the United States were required to allow for concealed carry of a handgun either permitlessly or with a permit, although the difficulty in obtaining a permit varies per jurisdiction.

There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect that concealed carry has on crime rates. A 2020 review by the RAND Corporation concluded there is supportive evidence that shall-issue concealed carry laws, which require states to issue permits to applicants once certain requirements are met, are associated with increased firearm homicides and total homicides. Earlier studies by RAND found that shall-issue concealed carry laws may increase violent crime overall, while there was inconclusive evidence for the effect of shall-issue laws on all individual types of violent crime. A 2004 literature review by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there is no link between the existence of laws that allow concealed carry and crime rates.

==History==
The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to &quot;keep and bear arms&quot;. Concealed weapons bans were passed in Kentucky and Louisiana in 1813. (In those days open carry of weapons for self-defense was considered acceptable; concealed carry was denounced as the practice of criminals.) By 1859, Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, and Ohio had followed suit. By the end of the nineteenth century, similar laws were passed in places such as Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma, which protected some gun rights in their state constitutions. Before the mid-1900s, most U.S. states had passed concealed carry laws rather than banning weapons completely. Until the late 1990s, many Southern states were either &quot;No-Issue&quot; or &quot;Restrictive May-Issue&quot;. Since then, these states have largely enacted &quot;Shall-Issue&quot; licensing laws, with more than half of the states legalizing &quot;constitutional carry&quot; (unrestricted concealed carry) and the remaining &quot;May-issue&quot; licensing laws being abolished in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court.

==State laws==
===Permitting policies===

* Unrestricted jurisdiction: one in which a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun. All states in this category allow any non-prohibited person to carry regardless of the state of residency.
* Permit requirement jurisdiction: one in which a permit is required to carry a concealed handgun.

Historically, some states were considered &quot;may-issue&quot; jurisdictions where an applicant was required to provide a proper cause or need to be issued a permit to carry a concealed weapon. However, on June 23, 2022, these laws were found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;.

Regulations differ widely by state, with twenty-seven of the fifty states either currently maintaining a constitutional carry policy or implementing it in the near future.

The Federal Gun-Free School Zones Act limits where an unlicensed person may carry; carry of a weapon, openly or concealed, within of a school zone is prohibited, with exceptions granted in the federal law to holders of valid state-issued weapons permits (state laws may reassert the illegality of school zone carry by license holders), and under LEOSA to current and honorably retired law enforcement officers (regardless of permit, usually overriding state law).

When in contact with an officer, some states require individuals to inform that officer that they are carrying a handgun.

Not all weapons that fall under CCW laws are lethal. For example, in Florida, carrying pepper spray in more than a specified volume (2 oz.) of chemical requires a CCW permit, whereas everyone may legally carry a smaller, “self-defense chemical spray” device hidden on their person without a CCW permit. there have been 21.52 million concealed weapon permits issued in the United States.

* Jurisdiction gives no minimum age to conceal carry in law. The age is set at 18 by federal law.

====Unrestricted jurisdictions====
An unrestricted jurisdiction is one in which a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun. This is sometimes called constitutional carry. Within the unrestricted category, there exist states that are &quot;fully unrestricted,&quot; where no permit is required for lawful open or concealed carry, and &quot;partially unrestricted,&quot; where certain forms of concealed carry may be legal without a permit, while other forms of carry may require a permit.

Some states have a limited form of permitless carry, restricted based on one or more of the following: a person&#x27;s location, the loaded/unloaded state of the firearm, or the specific persons who may carry without a permit. , these states are Illinois, New Mexico, and Washington. Some states that allow permitless concealed carry and still issue concealed carry permits may impose restrictions on concealed carry for certain places and/or at certain times (e.g., special events, large public gatherings, etc.). In some such situations, those holding a valid concealed carry permit may be exempt from such restrictions.

====Permit requirement jurisdictions====
A permit requirement jurisdiction is one in which a government-issued permit is required to carry a concealed handgun in public. Before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;, these jurisdictions were further split between &quot;shall-issue&quot;, which is the current national licensing standard where the granting of licenses is subject only to meeting determinate criteria laid out in the law, and &quot;may-issue&quot; where the granting of such licenses was at the discretion of local authorities. Since the abolishment of &quot;may-issue&quot; permitting the U.S. Supreme Court has stated it is still legal for U.S. jurisdictions subject to the Constitution to require a permit to carry a concealed handgun, and that background checks, training, and proper fees can be required without violating the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees a right of the people to carry a concealed firearm outside of the home.

==== Concealed carry on U.S. military installations ====
While members of the Armed Services may receive extensive small arms training, United States Military installations have some of the most restrictive rules for the possession, transport, and carrying of personally-owned firearms in the country.

Overall authority for carrying a personally-owned firearm on a military installation rests with the installation commander, although the authority to permit individuals to carry firearms on an installation is usually delegated to the Provost Marshal. Military installations do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, and state firearms laws generally do not apply to military bases, regardless of the state in which the installation is located. Federal law (18 USC, Section 930) generally forbids the possession, transport, and carrying of firearms on military installations without approval from the installation commander. Federal law gives installation commanders wide discretion in establishing firearms policies for their respective installations. In practice, local discretion is often constrained by policies and directives from the headquarters of each military branch and major commands.

Installation policies can vary from no-issue for most bases to shall-issue in rare circumstances. Installations that do allow the carrying of firearms typically restrict carrying to designated areas and for specific purposes (i.e., hunting or officially sanctioned shooting competitions in approved locations on the installation). Installation commanders may require the applicant to complete extensive firearms safety training, undergo a mental health evaluation, and obtain a letter of recommendation from their unit commander (or employer) before such authorization is granted. Personnel that reside on a military installation are typically required to store their personally-owned firearms in the installation armory, although the installation commander or provost marshal may permit a service member to store their personal firearms in their on-base dwelling if they have a gun safe or similarly designed cabinet where the firearms can be secured.

Prior to 2011, military commanders could impose firearms restrictions to servicemembers residing off-base, such as mandatory registration of firearms with the base provost marshal, restricting or banning the carrying of firearms by servicemembers either on or off the installation regardless of whether the member had a state permit to carry, and requiring servicemembers to have a gun safe or similar container to secure firearms when not in use. A provision was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 that limited commanders&#x27; authority to impose restrictions on the possession and use of personally-owned firearms by service members who reside off-base.

==== Concealed carry on Native American reservations ====
Concealed carry policies on Native American reservations are covered by the tribal laws for each reservation, which vary widely from &quot;No-Issue&quot; to &quot;Shall-Issue&quot; and &quot;Unrestricted&quot; either in law or in practice. Some Native American tribes recognize concealed carry permits for the state(s) in which the reservation is located, while others do not. For reservations that do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, some completely ban concealed carry, while others offer a tribal permit for concealed carry issued by the tribal police or tribal council. Tribal concealed carry permits may be available to the general populace or limited to tribal members, depending on tribal policies. Tribal law typically pre-empts state law on the reservation. The only exception is while traversing the reservation on a state-owned highway (including interstate, U.S. routes, and in some instances county roads), in which case state law and the federal Firearm Owners&#x27; Protection Act (FOPA) apply.

====Limitations on concealed carry====
Prohibitions of the concealed carry of firearms and other weapons by local governments predate the establishment of the United States. In 1686, New Jersey law stated &quot;no person or persons … shall presume privately to wear any pocket pistol … or other unusual or unlawful weapons within this Province.&quot; After the federal government was established, states and localities continued to restrict people from carrying hidden weapons. Tennessee law prohibited this as early as 1821. By 1837, Georgia passed into effect “An Act to guard and protect the citizens of this State, against the unwarrantable and too prevalent use of deadly weapons.&quot; Two years later, Alabama followed suit with “An Act to Suppress the Evil Practice of Carrying Weapons Secretly.&quot; Delaware prohibited the practice in 1852. Ohio did the same in 1859, a policy that remained in effect until 1974. Cities also regulated weapons within their boundaries. In 1881, Tombstone, Arizona, enacted Ordinance No. 9 &quot;To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons&quot;, a regulation that sparked the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral later that year.

Some permit requirement jurisdictions allow issuing authorities to impose limitations on CCW permits, such as the type and caliber of handguns that may be carried (Rhode Island, New Mexico), restrictions on places where the permit is valid (New York, Massachusetts, Illinois), restricting concealed carry to purposes or activities specified on the approved permit application (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York), limitations on magazine size (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York), or limitations on the number of firearms that may be carried concealed by a permit-holder at any given time (some states). Permits issued by all but two states (New York and Hawaii) are valid statewide. New York State pistol licenses, which are generally issued by counties, are valid statewide with one exception. A permit not issued by New York City is invalid in that city unless validated by its police commissioner. Permits issued by Hawaii are valid only in the county of issuance.

===Training requirements===
Some states require concealed carry applicants to certify their proficiency with a firearm through some type of training or instruction. Certain training courses developed by the National Rifle Association that combine classroom and live-fire instruction typically meet most state training requirements. Some states recognize prior military or police service as meeting training requirements.

Classroom instruction would typically include firearm mechanics and terminology, cleaning and maintenance of a firearm, concealed carry legislation and limitations, liability issues, carry methods and safety, home defense, methods for managing and defusing confrontational situations, and practice of gun handling techniques without firing the weapon. Most required CCW training courses devote a considerable amount of time to liability issues.

Depending on the state, a practical component during which the attendee shoots the weapon for the purpose of demonstrating safety and proficiency, may be required. During range instruction, applicants would typically learn and demonstrate safe handling and operation of a firearm and accurate shooting from common self-defense distances. Some states require a certain proficiency to receive a passing grade, whereas other states (e.g., Florida) technically require only a single shot to be fired to demonstrate handgun handling proficiency.

CCW training courses are typically completed in a single day and are good for a set period, the exact duration varying by state. Some states require re-training, sometimes in a shorter, simpler format, for each renewal.

A few states, e.g., South Carolina, recognize the safety and use-of-force training given to military personnel as acceptable in lieu of formal civilian training certification. Such states will ask for a military ID (South Carolina) for active persons or DD214 for honorably discharged persons. These few states will commonly request a copy of the applicant&#x27;s BTR (Basic Training Record) proving an up-to-date pistol qualification. Active and retired law enforcement officers are generally exempt from qualification requirements, due to a federal statute permitting qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in the United States.

Virginia recognizes eight specific training options to prove competency in handgun handling, ranging from DD214 for honorably discharged military veterans, to certification from law enforcement training, to firearms training conducted by a state or NRA-certified firearms instructor including electronic, video, or online courses. While any one of the eight listed options will be considered adequate proof, individual circuit courts may recognize other training options. A small number of states, such as Alabama and Georgia, have no training requirements to obtain a permit—only a requirement that the applicant successfully pass the required background check before issuance.

===Reciprocity===

Many jurisdictions recognize (honor) a permit or license issued by other jurisdictions. Recognition may be granted to all jurisdictions or some subset that meets a set of permit-issuing criteria, such as training comparable to the honoring jurisdiction or certain background checks. Several states have entered into formal agreements to mutually recognize permits. This arrangement is commonly called reciprocity or mutual recognition. A few states do not recognize permits issued by any other jurisdiction but offer non-resident permits for out-of-state individuals (who possess a valid concealed carry permit from their home state) who wish to carry while visiting such states. There are also states that neither recognize out-of-state concealed carry permits nor issue permits to non-residents, resulting in a complete ban on concealed carry by non-residents in such states. There are also states (Illinois and Rhode Island) that do not recognize out-of-state permits for carry-on-foot but do permit individuals with out-of-state concealed carry permits to carry while traveling in their vehicle (normally in accordance with the rules of the state of issuance).

Recognition and reciprocity of concealed carry privileges vary. Some states (e.g. Indiana, Virginia, Ohio) unilaterally recognize all permits. Others such as Michigan, limit such universal recognition to residents of the permit-issuing state. While 37  states have reciprocity agreements with at least one other state and several states honor all out-of-state concealed carry permits, some states have special requirements like training courses or safety exams, and therefore do not honor permits from states that do not have such requirements for issue. Some states make exceptions for persons under the minimum age (usually 21) if they are active or honorably discharged members of the military or a police force (the second of these two is subject additionally to federal law). States that do not have this exemption generally do not recognize any license from states that do. An example of this is the state of Washington&#x27;s refusal to honor any Texas  LTC as Texas has the military exception to age. Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Tennessee have standard and enhanced permits that have different requirements to obtain and also have unique reciprocity with different states; Utah and West Virginia have provisional permits for 18-20-year-olds with more limited recognition by other states.

Permits from Idaho (enhanced), Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota (class 1), and North Carolina have the highest number of recognition by other states (39 states). One can obtain multiple state permits in an effort to increase the number of states where that user can carry a legally concealed weapon. It is common practice to use a CCW Reciprocity Map to gain clarity on which states will honor the person&#x27;s combination of resident and non-resident permits given the variety of standards and legal policies from state to state. There are also various mobile applications that guide users in researching state concealed carry permit reciprocity.

Although carry may be legal under State law in accordance with reciprocity agreements, the Federal Gun Free School Zones Act subjects an out-of-state permit holder to federal felony prosecution if they carry a firearm within 1000 feet of any K–12 school&#x27;s property line; however, the enforcement of this statute is rare given several states&#x27; nullification statutes prohibiting state law enforcement officers from enforcing federal firearms laws. However, states may have their own similar statutes that such officers will enforce, and potentially expose the carrier to later prosecution under the Act.

===Restricted premises===
While generally a concealed carry permit allows the permit holder to carry a concealed weapon in public, a state may restrict carry of a firearm including a permitted concealed weapon while in or on certain properties, facilities or types of businesses that are otherwise open to the public. These areas vary by state (except for the first item below; federal offices are subject to superseding federal law) and can include:
* Federal government facilities, including post offices, IRS offices, federal court buildings, military/VA facilities and/or correctional facilities, Amtrak trains and facilities, and Corps of Engineers-controlled property (carry in these places is prohibited by federal law and preempts any existing state law). Carry on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (federal parks and wildlife preserves) is allowed by federal law as of the 2009 CARD Act, but is still subject to state law. However, carry into restrooms or any other buildings or structures located within federal parks is illegal in the United States, despite concealed carry being otherwise legal in federal parks with a permit recognized by the state in which the federal park is located. Similarly, concealed carry into caves located within federal parks is illegal.
* State and local government facilities, including courthouses, DMV/DoT offices, police stations, correctional facilities, and/or meeting places of government entities (exceptions may be made for certain persons working in these facilities such as judges, lawyers, and certain government officials both elected and appointed)
* Venues for political events, including rallies, parades, debates, and/or polling places
* Educational institutions including elementary/secondary schools and colleges. Some states have &quot;drop-off exceptions&quot; which only prohibit carry inside school buildings, or permit carry while inside a personal vehicle on school property. Campus carry laws vary by state.
* Public interscholastic and/or professional sporting events and/or venues (sometimes only during a time window surrounding such an event)
* Amusement parks, fairs, parades and/or carnivals
* Businesses that sell alcohol (sometimes only &quot;by-the-drink&quot; sellers like restaurants, sometimes only establishments defined as a &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;nightclub&quot;, or establishments where the percentage of total sales from alcoholic beverages exceeds a specified threshold)
* Hospitals (even if hospitals themselves are not restricted, &quot;teaching hospitals&quot; partnered with a medical school are sometimes considered &quot;educational institutions&quot;; exceptions are sometimes made for medical professionals working in these facilities)
* Churches, mosques and other &quot;Houses of worship&quot;, usually at the discretion of the church clergy (Ohio allows with specific permission of house of worship)
* Municipal mass transit vehicles or facilities
* Sterile areas of airports (sections of the airport located beyond security screening checkpoints, unless explicitly authorized)
* Non-government facilities with heightened security measures (Nuclear facilities, power plants, dams, oil and gas production facilities, banks, factories, unless explicitly authorized)
* Aboard aircraft or ships unless specifically authorized by the pilot in command or ship captain
* Private property where the lawful owner or lessee has posted a sign or verbally stated that firearms are not permitted. Some states have enacted laws prohibiting the carrying of firearms on private property, unless the property owner or lawful occupant has explicitly granted permission for the carrying of weapons on the premises.
* Any public place, while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including certain prescription or over-the-counter medications, depending on jurisdiction)

===&quot;Opt-out&quot; statutes (&quot;gun-free zones&quot;)===
Some states allow private businesses to post a specific sign prohibiting concealed carry within their premises. The exact language and format of such a sign varies by state. By posting the signs, businesses create areas where it is illegal to carry a concealed handgun—similar to regulations concerning schools, hospitals, and public gatherings.

Violation of such a sign, in some of these states, is grounds for revocation of the offender&#x27;s concealed carry permit and criminal prosecution. Other states, such as Virginia, enforce only trespassing laws when a person violates a &quot;Gun Free Zone&quot; sign. In some jurisdictions, trespass by a person carrying a firearm may have more severe penalties than &quot;simple&quot; trespass, while in other jurisdictions, penalties are lower than for trespass.

Such states include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

There is considerable dispute over the effectiveness of such &quot;gun-free zones&quot;. Opponents of such measures, such as OpenCarry.org, state that, much like other &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; laws banning gun-related practices, only law-abiding individuals will heed the signage and disarm. Individuals or groups intent on committing far more serious crimes, such as armed robbery or murder, will not be deterred by signage prohibiting weapons. Further, the reasoning follows that those wishing to commit mass murder might &quot;intentionally&quot; choose gun-free venues like shopping malls, schools, and churches (where weapons carry is generally prohibited by statute or signage) because the population inside is disarmed and thus less able to stop them.

In some states, business owners have been documented posting signs that appear to prohibit guns, but legally do not because the signs do not meet local or state laws defining the required appearance, placement, or wording of signage. Such signage can be posted out of ignorance of the law, or intent to pacify gun control advocates while not actually prohibiting the practice. The force of law behind a non-compliant sign varies based on state statutes and case law. Some states interpret their statutes&#x27; high level of specification of signage as evidence that the signage must meet the specification exactly, and any quantifiable deviation from the statute makes the sign non-binding. Other states have decided in case law that if efforts were made in good faith to conform to the statutes, the sign carries the force of law even if it fails to meet current specifications. Still, others have such lax descriptions of what is a valid sign that virtually any sign that can be interpreted as &quot;no guns allowed&quot; is binding on the license holder. 

Note that virtually all jurisdictions allow some form of oral communication by the lawful owner or controller of the property that a person is not welcome and should leave. This notice can be given to anyone for any reason (except for statuses that are protected by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other CRAs, such as race), including due to the carrying of firearms by that person, and refusal to heed such a request to leave may constitute trespassing.

===Brandishing and printing===
Printing refers to a circumstance where the shape or outline of a firearm is visible through a garment while the gun is still fully covered, and is generally not desired when carrying a concealed weapon. Brandishing can refer to different actions depending on jurisdiction. These actions can include printing through a garment, pulling back clothing to expose a gun, or unholstering a gun and exhibiting it in the hand. The intent to intimidate or threaten someone may or may not be required legally for it to be considered brandishing.

Brandishing is a crime in most jurisdictions, but the definition of brandishing varies widely.

Under California law, the following conditions have to be present to prove brandishing:

In Virginia law:

==Federal law==

===Gun Control Act of 1968===
The Gun Control Act passed by Congress in 1968 lists felons, illegal aliens, and other codified persons as prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. During the application process for concealed carry, states carry out thorough background checks to prevent these individuals from obtaining permits. Additionally, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act created an FBI-maintained system in 1994 for instantly checking the backgrounds of potential firearms buyers in an effort to prevent these individuals from obtaining weapons.

=== Firearm Owners Protection Act ===
The Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986 allows a gun owner to travel through states in which their firearm possession is illegal as long as it is legal in the states of origination and destination, the owner is in transit and does not remain in the state in which firearm possession is illegal, and the firearm is transported unloaded and in a locked container. The FOPA addresses the issue of transport of private firearms from origin to destination for purposes lawful in state of origin and destination; FOPA does not authorize concealed carry as a weapon of defense during transit. New York State Police arrested those carrying firearms in violation of state law, and then required them to use FOPA as an affirmative defense to the charges of illegal possession.

===Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act===
In 2004, the United States Congress enacted the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, 18 U.S. Code 926B and 926C. This federal law allows two classes of persons – the &quot;qualified law enforcement officer&quot; and the &quot;qualified retired law enforcement officer&quot; – to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of any state or local law to the contrary, with the exception of areas where all firearms are prohibited without permission, and certain Title II weapons.

===Federal Gun Free School Zones Act===
The Federal Gun Free School Zone Act limits where a person may legally carry a firearm. It does this by making it generally unlawful for an armed citizen to be within 1,000 feet (extending out from the property lines) of a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a K–12 school. Although a state-issued carry permit may exempt a person from this restriction in the state that physically issued their permit, it does not exempt them in other states which recognize their permit under reciprocity agreements made with the issuing state.

===Federal property===
Some federal statutes restrict the carrying of firearms on the premises of certain federal properties such as military installations or land controlled by the USACE.

===National park carry===
On May 22, 2009, President Barack Obama signed H.R. 627, the &quot;Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009&quot;, into law. The bill contained a rider introduced by Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) that prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from enacting or enforcing any regulations that restrict possession of firearms in National Parks or Wildlife Refuges, as long as the person complies with laws of the state in which the unit is found. This provision was supported by the National Rifle Association and opposed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, among other organizations. As of February 2010 concealed handguns are for the first time legal in all but 3 of the nation&#x27;s 391 national parks and wildlife refuges so long as all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are adhered to. Hawaii is a notable exception. Concealed and open carry are both illegal in Hawaii for all except retired military or law enforcement personnel. Previously firearms were allowed into parks if cased and unloaded.

===Full faith and credit (CCW permits)===
Attempts were made in the 110th Congress, United States House of Representatives (H.R. 226) and the United States Senate (S. 388), to enact legislation to compel complete reciprocity for concealed carry licenses. Opponents of national reciprocity have pointed out that this legislation would effectively require states with more restrictive standards of permit issuance (e.g., training courses, safety exams, &quot;good cause&quot; requirements, etc.) to honor permits from states with more liberal issuance policies. Supporters have pointed out that the same situation already occurs with marriage certificates, adoption decrees, and other state documents under the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; clause of the U.S. Constitution. Some states have already adopted a &quot;full faith and credit&quot; policy treating out-of-state carry permits the same as out-of-state driver&#x27;s license or marriage certificates without federal legislation mandating such a policy. In the 115th Congress, another universal reciprocity bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, was introduced by Richard Hudson. The bill passed the House but did not get a vote in the Senate.

==Legal issues==

===Court rulings===
Prior to the 1897 Supreme Court case &quot;Robertson v. Baldwin&quot;, the federal courts had been silent on the issue of concealed carry. In the from a maritime law case, the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the federal Second Amendment. However, in the context of such rulings, open carry of firearms was generally unrestricted in the jurisdictions in question, which provided an alternative means of &quot;bearing&quot; arms.

In the majority decision in the 2008 Supreme Court case of &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote;
&quot;Heller&quot; was a landmark case because, for the first time in United States history, a Supreme Court decision defined the right to bear arms as constitutionally guaranteed to private citizens rather than a right restricted to &quot;well-regulated militia[s]&quot;. The Justices asserted that sensible restrictions on the right to bear arms are constitutional, however, an outright ban on a specific type of firearm, in this case handguns, was in fact unconstitutional. The Heller decision is limited because it only applies to federal enclaves such as the District of Columbia. In 2010, the SCOTUS expanded Heller in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot; incorporating the 2nd Amendment through the 14th Amendment as applying to local and state laws. Various Circuit Courts have upheld their local and state laws using intermediate scrutiny. The correct standard is a strict scrutiny review for all &quot;fundamental&quot; and &quot;individual&quot; rights. On June 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the handgun ban enacted by the city of Chicago, Illinois, in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;, effectively extending the Heller decision to states and local governments nationwide. Banning handguns in any jurisdiction has the effect of rendering invalid any licensed individual&#x27;s right to carry concealed in that area except for federally exempted retired and current law enforcement officers and other government employees acting in the discharge of their official duties.

In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;, that the Second Amendment does protect &quot;an individual&#x27;s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.&quot; The case struck down New York&#x27;s strict law requiring people to show &quot;proper cause&quot; in order to get a concealed weapons permit, and could affect similar laws in other states such as California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, the attorney generals of each of California, Hawaii (concealed-carry licenses only), Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (permits issued by municipalities only) issued guidance that their &quot;proper cause&quot; or similar requirements would no longer be enforced.

===Legal liability===
Even when self-defense is justified, there can be serious civil or criminal liabilities related to self-defense when a concealed carry permit holder brandishes or fires their weapon. For example, if innocent bystanders are hurt or killed, there could be both civil and criminal liabilities even if the use of deadly force was completely justified. Some states technically allow an assailant who is shot by a gun owner to bring a civil action. In some states, liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon, threatens use, or exacerbates a volatile situation, or when the resident is carrying it while intoxicated. It is important to note that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states that allow concealed carry, however, forbid suits being brought in such cases, either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff, or by granting the gun owner immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that they were justified in shooting.

Simultaneously, increased passage of &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; laws allow persons who own firearms and/or carry them concealed to use them without first attempting to retreat. The &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; typically applies to situations within the confines of one&#x27;s own home. Nevertheless, many states have adopted escalation of force laws along with provisions for concealed carry. These include the necessity to first verbally warn a trespasser or lay hands on a trespasser before a shooting is justified (unless the trespasser is armed or assumed to be so). This escalation of force does not apply if the shooter reasonably believes a violent felony has been or is about to be committed on the property by the trespasser. Additionally, some states have a duty to retreat provision which requires a permit holder, especially in public places, to vacate themself from a potentially dangerous situation before resorting to deadly force. The duty to retreat does not restrictively apply in a person&#x27;s home or business though escalation of force may be required. In 1895 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Beard v. United States&quot; that if an individual does not provoke an assault and is residing in a place they have a right to be, then they may use considerable force against someone they reasonably believe may do them serious harm without being charged with murder or manslaughter should that person be killed. Further, in Texas and California homicide is justifiable solely in defense of property. In other states, lethal force is authorized only when serious harm is presumed to be imminent.

Even given these relaxed restrictions on the use of force, using a handgun must still be a last resort in some jurisdictions; meaning the user must reasonably believe that nothing short of deadly force will protect the life or property at stake in a situation. Additionally, civil liabilities for errors that cause harm to others still exist, although civil immunity is provided in the Castle Doctrine laws of some states (e.g., Texas).

===Penalties for carrying illegally===

Criminal possession of a weapon is the unlawful possession of a weapon by a citizen. Many societies both past and present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens (and to a lesser extent police) are allowed to purchase, own, and carry in public. Such crimes are public order crimes and are considered &quot;mala prohibita&quot;, in that the possession of a weapon in and of itself is not evil. Rather, the &quot;potential&quot; for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a possible need to control them. Some restrictions are strict liability, whereas others require some element of intent to use the weapon for an illegal purpose. Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances. Lawful uses of weapons by civilians commonly include hunting, sport, collection and self-preservation.

The penalties for carrying a firearm in an unlawful manner vary widely from state-to-state, and may range from a simple infraction punishable by a fine to a felony conviction and mandatory incarceration. An individual may also be charged and convicted of criminal charges other than unlawful possession of a firearm, such as assault, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, or trespassing. In the case of an individual with no prior criminal convictions, the state of Tennessee classifies the unlawful concealed carry of a loaded handgun as a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. While in New York State, a similar crime committed by an individual with no criminal convictions is classified as a Class D felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years imprisonment, to a maximum of 7 years. As New York State does not recognize any pistol permits issued in other states, the statute would apply to any individual who does not have a valid New York State issued concealed carry permit, even if such individual has a valid permit issued in another jurisdiction. In addition, the New York State statutory definition of a &quot;loaded firearm&quot; differs significantly from what may be commonly understood, as simply possessing any ammunition along with a weapon capable of firing such ammunition satisfies the legal definition of a loaded firearm in New York. The large variability of state carry laws has resulted in confusing circumstances where a person in Vermont (which requires no license of any kind to carry a concealed weapon by anyone who is not prohibited by law), could unwittingly travel into the adjacent state of New York, where such individual, despite acting entirely within the law of Vermont, would then face a mandatory 3.5-year prison sentence simply for accidentally crossing the state&#x27;s border into New York. These circumstances are aggravated by the fact that many NYS police departments as well as the New York State Police do not recognize the protections granted federally under the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which was intended to prevent such prosecutions.

==Effect on crime and deaths==
Research has had mixed results, indicating variously that right-to-carry laws have no impact on violent crime, that they increase violent crime, and that they decrease violent crime.

A 2020 study by the RAND Corporation of over 200 combinations of gun policies and outcomes found &quot;supportive evidence that shall-issue concealed carry laws are associated with increased firearm homicides and total homicides&quot;. They also found supportive evidence that child access prevention laws reduce firearm homicides and self-injuries among youth, and further evidence supporting the conclusion that stand-your-ground laws are associated with increased levels of firearm homicides. The researchers credit a much greater investment in gun safety research over the past few years with providing this and other more recent studies with stronger and more reliable evidence.

A 2004 review of the existing literature by the National Academy of Sciences found that the results of existing studies were sensitive to the specification and time period examined, and concluded that a causal link between right-to-carry laws and crime rates cannot be shown. Quinnipiac University economist Mark Gius summarized literature published between 1993 and 2005, and found that ten papers suggested that permissive CCW laws reduce crime, one paper suggested they increase crime, and nine papers showed no definitive results. A 2017 review of the existing literature concluded, &quot;Given the most recent evidence, we conclude with considerable confidence that deregulation of gun carrying over the last four decades has undermined public safety—which is to say that restricting concealed carry is one gun regulation that appears to be effective.&quot; A 2016 study in the &quot;European Economic Review&quot; which examined the conflicting claims in the existing literature concluded that the evidence CCW either increases or decreases crime on average &quot;seems weak&quot;; the study&#x27;s model found &quot;some support to the law having a negative (but with a positive trend) effect on property crimes, and a small but positive (and increasing) effect on violent crimes&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; fact-checker concluded that it could not state that CCW laws reduced crime, as the evidence was murky and in dispute. In a 2017 article in the journal &quot;Science,&quot; Stanford University law professor John Donohue and Duke University economist Philip J. Cook write that &quot;there is an emerging consensus that, on balance, the causal effect of deregulating concealed carry (by replacing a restrictive law with an RTC law) has been to increase violent crime&quot;. Donohue and Cook argue that the crack epidemic made it difficult to determine the causal effects of CCW laws and that this made earlier results inconclusive; recent research does not suffer the same challenges with causality. A 2018 RAND review of the literature concluded that concealed carry either has no impact on crime or that it may increase violent crime. The review said, &quot;We found no qualifying studies showing that concealed-carry laws decreased [violent crime].&quot;
A 2020 study in &quot;PNAS&quot; found that right-to-carry laws were associated with higher firearm deaths. A 2019 panel study published in the &quot;Journal of General Internal Medicine&quot; by medical researchers including Michael Siegel of the Boston University School of Public Health and David Hemenway of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that “shall issue&quot; concealed carry laws were associated with a 9% increase in homicides. A 2019 study in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that greater restrictions on concealed carry laws were associated with decreases in workplace homicide rates. Another 2019 study in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that states with right-to-carry laws were associated with a 29% higher rate of firearm workplace homicides. A 2019 study in the &quot;Journal of Empirical Legal Studies&quot; found that right-to-carry laws led to an increase in overall violent crime. A 2017 study in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that &quot;shall-issue laws&quot; (where concealed carry permits must be given if criteria are met) &quot;are associated with significantly higher rates of total, firearm-related, and handgun-related homicide&quot; than &quot;may-issue laws&quot; (where local law enforcement have discretion over who can get a concealed carry permit). A 2011 study found that aggravated assaults increase when concealed carry laws are adopted.

A 2019 study in &quot;Journal of American College of Surgeons&quot; found &quot;no statistically significant association between the liberalization of state level firearm carry legislation over the last 30 years and the rates of homicides or other violent crime.&quot; This is also in line with a 1997 study researching county-level data from 1977 to 1992 concluding that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths. A 2018 study in &quot;The Review of Economics and Statistics&quot; found that the impact of right-to-carry laws was mixed and changed over time. RTC laws increased some crimes over some periods while decreasing other crimes over other periods. The study suggested that conclusions drawn in other studies are highly dependent on the time periods that are studied, the types of models that are adopted and the assumptions that are made. A 2015 study that looked at issuance rates of concealed-carry permits and changes in violent crime by county-level in four shall-issue states found no increases or decreases in violent crime rates with changes in permit issuances. A 2019 study in the &quot;International Review of Law and Economics&quot; found that with one method, right-to-carry laws had no impact on violent crime, but with another method led to an increase in violent crime; neither method showed that right-to-carry laws led to a reduction in crime. A 2003 study found no significant changes in violent crime rates amongst 58 Florida counties with increases of concealed-carry permits. A 2004 study found no significant association between homicide rates and shall-issue concealed carry laws.

A 2013 study of eight years of Texas data found that concealed handgun licensees were much less likely to be convicted of crimes than were nonlicensees. The same study found that licensees&#x27; convictions were more likely to be for less common crimes, &quot;such as sexual offenses, gun offenses, or offenses involving a death.&quot; A 2020 study in &quot;Applied Economics Letters&quot; examining concealed-carry permits per capita by state found a significant negative effect on violent crime rates. A 2016 study found a significant negative effect on violent crime rates with passage of shall-issue laws. A 2017 study in &quot;Applied Economics Letters&quot; found that property crime decreased in Chicago after the implementation of the shall issue concealed carry law. A 2014 &quot;Applied Economics Letters&quot; study found states with more permissive conceal carry laws had lower murder rates than states with restrictive laws. Another 2014 study found that RTC laws by state significantly reduce homicide rates.

In 1996 economists John R. Lott, Jr. and David B. Mustard analyzed crime data in all 3,054 counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, finding counties that had shall-issue licensing laws overall saw murders decrease by 7.65 percent, rapes decrease by 5.2 percent, aggravated assaults decrease by 7 percent and robberies decrease by 2.2 percent. The study was widely disputed by numerous economists. The 2004 National Academy of Sciences panel reviewing the research on the subject concluded, with one dissenting panelist, that the Lott and Mustard study was unreliable. Georgetown University Professor Jens Ludwig, Daniel Nagin of Carnegie Mellon University and Dan A. Black of the University of Chicago in &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot;, said of the Lott-Mustard study, &quot;once Florida is removed from the sample, there is no longer any detectable impact of right-to-carry laws on the rates of murder and rape&quot;.

A 2022 study examining the Sullivan Act of 1911 found that the law had no impact on overall homicide rates, reduced overall suicide rates, and caused large and sustained decrease in gun-related suicide rates.

=== Firearms permit holders in active shooter incidents ===

In 2016 FBI analyzed 40 &quot;active shooter incidents&quot; in 2014 and 2015 where bystanders were put in peril in ongoing incidents that could be affected by police or citizen response. Six incidents were successfully ended when citizens intervened. In two stops citizens restrained the shooters, one unarmed, one with pepper spray. In two stops at schools, the shooters were confronted by teachers: one shooter disarmed, and one committed suicide. In two stops citizens with firearms permits exchanged gunfire with the shooter. In a failed stop attempt, a citizen with a firearms permit was killed by the shooter. In 2018 the FBI analyzed 50 active shooter incidents in 2016 and 2017. This report focused on policies to neutralize active shooters to save lives. In 10 incidents citizens confronted an active shooter. In eight incidents the citizens stopped the shooter. Four stops involved unarmed citizens who confronted and restrained or blocked the shooter or talked the shooter into surrendering. Four stops involved citizens with firearms permits: two exchanged gunfire with a shooter and two detained the shooter at gunpoint for arrest by responding police. Of the two failed stops, one involved a permit holder who exchanged gunfire with the shooter but the shooter fled and continued shooting and the other involved a permit holder who was wounded by the shooter. &quot;Armed and unarmed citizens engaged the shooter in 10 incidents. They safely and successfully ended the shootings in eight of those incidents. Their selfless actions likely saved many lives.&quot;

<doc id="1137189" wikidata="Q2405612" url="?curid=1137189" title="Spiritual Warfare (video game)">
<text>Spiritual Warfare is a 1992 Christian video game developed by Wisdom Tree for the Nintendo Entertainment System, it was later ported to MS-DOS, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis, and re-released as a part of the Spiritual Warfare &amp; Wisdom Tree Collection in 2017 on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The game was not officially licensed by Nintendo for the NES, so it was mostly sold in Christian bookstores instead of traditional video game retailers.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Spiritual Warfare&quot; is presented in a top-down perspective, similar to action-adventure game &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

The player controls a Christian as he traverses an overworld with various environments. Areas of the game include a park, a downtown, an airport, a warehouse district, a hotel district, a shipyard, a residential area, a junkyard, a beach, some woods, and a prison which sits upon the final demon stronghold level.

During the gameplay, angels can be encountered that give power-ups and educational video game style Bible trivia quizzes. The game has two forms of attack; a simple wind-and-dust bomb (similar to the &quot;feng chen pao&quot; depicted in the &quot;Huolongjing&quot;) and the main weapon features role-playing levels in the form of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, represented by five fruits; pears, pomegranates, apples, grapes and bananas. The in-game currency is a Dove peace symbol.

The player defeats enemies by harnessing the fruits to save souls from demons, and using the currency of peace to add more Fruits of the Spirit to their arsenal. In order to free the town of the influences of &quot;ultimate source of evil&quot;, the player must collect each of the six pieces of the Armor of God, which are guarded by bosses. Along the way, the player may collect other helpful Biblical items such as Samson&#x27;s Jawbone and Anointing Oil.

==Re-release==
The game was ported in 2017 to Steam and Humble Bundle by Piko Interactive using DOSBox, as the main featured title in the &quot;Spiritual Warfare &amp; Wisdom Tree Collection&quot; which featured the MS-DOS version of &quot;Spiritual Warfare&quot;, &quot;Bible Adventures&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot;, and &quot;Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho&quot;.

<text>Tracy Irving Richard Ulrich (born January 20, 1966), known professionally as Tracii Guns, is an American guitarist best known as the co-founder of glam metal group L.A. Guns, as well as the supergroups Brides of Destruction and Contraband. He was also a founding member of Guns N&#x27; Roses. However, he left shortly afterwards; he was replaced by guitarist Slash.

== Early life ==
Ulrich&#x27;s uncle Ron taught him how to play guitar at a young age.

Ulrich attended Fairfax High in Los Angeles. While there, he met future L.A. Guns members Robert Gardner and Michael Jagosz. The three formed a band called Pyrrhus with bassist Dani Tull. Ulrich (now going by Tracii Guns), Gardner, and Jagosz recruited Danish bassist Ole Beich for their new band in 1983, officially starting L.A. Guns after leaving Guns &#x27;N Roses.

Ulrich cites Johnny Thunders, Randy Rhoads, Eddie Van Halen, Mick Jagger, Michael Schenker, Tony Iommi, and Jimmy Page as his influences.

== Biography ==

=== First stint with L.A. Guns and Guns N&#x27; Roses (1983–1985) ===

L.A. Guns was formed by Guns in 1983, initially with singer Mike Jagosz, bassist Ole Beich, and drummer Rob Gardner. This lineup recorded the EP &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition No. 1&quot; which would be the only release from the band with its original lineup. After Jagosz was arrested in a bar fight, Bill Rose (later known as Axl Rose) joined the band as singer. Rose had previously fronted Hollywood Rose, backed by Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber. Rose&#x27;s stint in the band was short-lived, as Jagosz returned weeks later. Guns joined a newly reunited Hollywood Rose (alongside Rose, Stradlin, Gardner, and Steve Darrow) for a 1985 New Years show. Shortly afterwards, L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose merged bands to become Guns N&#x27; Roses, with the lineup consisting of Guns, Rose, Stradlin, Gardner, and Beich. Guns, Beich, and Gardner would exit Guns N&#x27; Roses just two months into the new band, with Guns leaving after an argument with Rose, claiming &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t fun anymore.&quot; Guns was replaced by Slash, while Gardner and Beich were replaced by Steven Adler and Duff McKagan respectively, forming the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

=== Reformation of L.A. Guns (1985–2002) ===
Later in 1985, Guns and singer Paul Black reformed L.A. Guns, recruiting former Dogs D&#x27;Amour singer Robert Stoddard to be the new guitarist with the group, which was rounded out by Nickey &quot;Beat&quot; Alexander on drums and Mick Cripps on bass. The group&#x27;s lineup would change with Black being replaced by Girl frontman Phil Lewis, bassist Cripps switching to guitar, replacing Stoddard, and former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels joining the group. L.A. Guns recorded their eponymous first album that was released in 1988 on Vertigo Records, charting at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On the first album&#x27;s supporting tour, Alexander was replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with the lineup being regarded as the &quot;Classic lineup&quot; of L.A. Guns. This lineup remained until 1992. In 1989, they released their second album &quot;Cocked &amp; Loaded&quot;, which charted higher on the Billboard 200 at number 38. During 1991, the band released their third album &quot;Hollywood Vampires&quot; on Polydor Records. In 1994, they released their fourth album &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, drummer Michael &quot;Bones&quot; Gersema played on parts of this recording as this was around the time Phil Lewis fired drummer Steve Riley in January 1992 after touring with Skid Row in support of Hollywood Vampires. Riley later returned to the band for the successful &quot;Vicious Circle&quot; club tour. After this, L.A. Guns were dropped from Polygram (Vertigo/Polydor) Records. Phil Lewis and Mick Cripps then left the band.

July 1995 saw Guns and Steve Riley recruit vocalist Chris Van Dahl and guitarist Johnny Crypt (ex-Ripper, aka Johnny Crystal) after seeing them perform with their band Boneyard. Six months into recording sessions, Kelly Nickels left the band and Johnny switched to the bass. In 1996, the new L.A. Guns released their fifth record, titled &quot;American Hardcore&quot;. They toured throughout 1996 and into 1997 where Tracii let Chris go, who was replaced by singer Ralph Saenz. Tracii, Steve, Johnny, and Ralph toured for the remainder of &#x27;97 and in early &#x27;98 released the six song EP &quot;Wasted&quot;. Halfway through the band&#x27;s 1998 Rock Never Stops tour, Ralph quit to form his own band, forcing the band to find a new singer. Joe Lesté from Bang Tango and Jizzy Pearl from Love/Hate were considered as candidates, with Pearl getting the job. They toured in late 1998 and early 1999 and released &quot;Shrinking Violet&quot;, produced by former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke. This release was followed shortly by Crypt&#x27;s departure.

In September 1999, the classic lineup of Tracii Guns, Steve Riley, Phil Lewis, Kelly Nickels, and Mick Cripps prepared to reunite. L.A. Guns set out on the reunion tour in October 1999 and recorded a live album in their hometown of Hollywood, enlisting Gilby Clarke as producer. The album, named &quot;&quot;, was released the following year. After the reunion, Mick and Kelly couldn&#x27;t commit to the summer 2000 tour, so they were replaced by guitarist Brent Muscat and bassist Muddy Stardust, respectively. Ratt and L.A. Guns teamed up with Warrant for a remainder-of-the-summer tour, which L.A. Guns dropped off in August due to booking problems. Mick Cripps again rejoined the band briefly in late 2000 to record an album with the band, entitled &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;, which was released on Spitfire Records in April 2001. L.A. Guns released the album &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, the last album to feature Tracii Guns, in August 2002, produced by Andy Johns, to mainly positive reviews from critics and fans. The future of L.A. Guns was in doubt until both Steve Riley and Phil Lewis told the &quot;Hairball John Radio Show&quot; that the band would continue despite Tracii Guns&#x27; involvement in Brides of Destruction.

Guns left the band in October 2002.

=== Brides of Destruction (2002–2005) ===

Despite signing a deal with Spitfire Records, Tracii Guns left L.A. Guns during the recording of a new album, to form Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx, initially with the name Cockstar, after Mötley Crüe went on hiatus. After a number of changes, the lineup was rounded off with singer London LeGrand and drummer Scot Coogan. They released &quot;Here Come The Brides&quot;, which charted at number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, in 2004 and was the first album featuring Guns to chart since Hollywood Vampires in 1991. Nikki Sixx would leave the group in October 2004. Initially Guns was to form a new band with the remaining Brides members and also offered his services to Axl Rose in a bid to join Guns N&#x27; Roses. Eventually he continued with the Brides and Scott Sorry formerly of Amen was chosen as Sixx&#x27;s replacement. Ginger of The Wildhearts was added as the band&#x27;s second guitarist. The band then started writing for what would become Runaway Brides but soon after, Ginger departed the Brides. The follow-up to Here Come the Brides, Runaway Brides, was produced by Andy Johns who had previously worked with Guns on the L.A. Guns album &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;. Three of the songs of the album were co-written by Nikki Sixx, written during the &quot;Here Come the Bride&quot; sessions with former guitarist Ginger also contributing writing on 3 tracks prior to leaving. The album saw a change in a style with it leaning towards a heavy metal sound in contrast with the hard rock/post-grunge sound of the first album. &quot;Dimes in Heaven&quot; was written as a tribute to recently deceased Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell. After signing a new deal with Shrapnel Records, the album was released in Europe on September 13 and on September 27 in the US. A video was shot for &quot;White Trash&quot; but both the album and the single failed to chart. With the formation of The Tracii Guns Band, later the second L.A. Guns, the Brides were put on indefinite hiatus.

=== Third Stint with L.A. Guns (2005–2013) ===
In 2006, Guns announced he was to perform a &#x27;Best Of&quot; tour with former L.A. Guns members Paul Black on vocals, Nickey Alexander on drums and former Brides live member Jeremy Guns rounding up the lineup on bass following a brief stint with Quiet Riot. With The Tracii Guns Band touring, this put Brides of Destruction on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Eventually The Tracii Guns Band would become the second L.A. Guns. Drummer Chad Stewart eventually joined the group replacing Nickey Alexander. On March 4, 2008, Tracii Guns&#x27; L.A. Guns was announced as one of the acts of the second Rocklahoma festival.

In 2008, Tracii Guns&#x27; L.A. Guns signed a deal with Alexis Records and began working on material for a new album with producer Steve Thompson. Singer Marty Casey, of Lovehammers, was asked to co-write some songs with the band by bassist Jeremy Guns. Eventually Paul Black left the group and Marty was asked to replace him. They finished recording the album and set a release date for March 2009. The group toured through 2008 and early 2009 and also recorded a pilot for VH1. While waiting for a release date to be set for the new album, as well as deciding on a new name for the band, Marty Casey returned to Lovehammers releasing new album &quot;Heavy Crown&quot;. Jizzy Pearl returned to front L.A. Guns for a summer tour while guitarist Alec Bauer departed the band.

After a long-running dispute with Phil Lewis (Lewis had been touring as &quot;Phil Lewis&#x27;s L.A. Guns&quot;) over the name to the group, Tracii Guns disbanded his version of L.A. Guns in July 2012.

=== Tracii Guns&#x27; League of Gentlemen (2012–present) ===

In 2012, Guns formed a blues-rock band called &quot;Tracii Guns&#x27; League of Gentlemen&quot; with front man Scott Foster Harris, a one-time member of the L.A. Guns. Harris, a native Texan, provides vocals for the League. Other musicians in the band bass player Craig &quot;Patches&quot; McCloskey, drummer Doni Gray (L.A. Guns, Burning Tree), and keyboardist John Bird. The band&#x27;s music is inspired by British and American psychedelic blues and rock music from the 1960s and 1970s.

In June 2013, the band released their debut album, &quot;The First Record&quot; through Shrapnel Records. In August 2014, &quot;The Second Record&quot; was released, again with Shrapnel Records.

=== Fourth Stint with L.A. Guns (2016-present) ===
In the summer of 2016, Guns teamed up with Phil Lewis for the first time in 14 years for a handful of shows under the name &quot;L.A. Guns&#x27; Phil Lewis + Tracii Guns&quot;. Under the &quot;L.A. Guns&quot; name, Guns and Lewis released a new album The Missing Peace on October 13, 2017.

=== Sunbomb with Michael Sweet (2021) ===
On May 14, 2021, Tracii Guns and Stryper frontman Michael Sweet released the album &quot;Evil and Divine&quot; on Frontiers Records as a project titled Sunbomb. In an interview with the radio show and podcast The Hard, Heavy &amp; Hair Show with Pariah Burke, Guns described the Doom Metal-influenced Sunbomb album as, the &quot;first focused, I-don&#x27;t-give-a-shit Metal album I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

Sometime during 2017, Guns was approached by Serafino Perugino, President and A&amp;R director of Frontiers Music SRL, about doing a solo album. Guns told Pariah Burke, &quot;no way was I going to do an instrumental album.&quot; Eventually, Guns settled on the idea of writing and recording an album of music that reminded him of &quot;what I used to listen to when I was a teenager first learning to play guitar.&quot; The result is an album of much heavier songs than Guns&#x27; usual songwriting for L.A. Guns or past projects Contraband and Brides of Destruction, though, Guns said, parts of the Sunbomb music are reminiscent of his playing in Devil City Angels. When it came time to choose a vocalist, Guns turned to Stryper&#x27;s Michael Sweet, whom Guns told Burke he had befriended years earlier during a shared tour stopover in Massachusetts.

&quot;Evil and Divine&quot; also features drums by Adam Hamilton (L.A. Guns), Johnny Martin (L.A. Guns) playing bass on song &quot;They Fought,&quot; and Mitch Davis playing bass on the other 10 tracks.

=== Other work ===
Contraband was a short-lived supergroup/side project that included vocalist Richard Black, of Shark Island, guitarist Michael Schenker, of Scorpions, UFO and Michael Schenker Group, bassist Share Pedersen, of Vixen, drummer Bobby Blotzer, of Ratt, and Guns taking up the second guitar role. They released one self-titled album in 1991 which received lukewarm reviews. The album was a commercial failure and the band disbanded shortly after, while touring with Ratt.

In 1999, Guns played a show in Hollywood, California with former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke, who produced the L.A. Guns album Shrinking Violet in the same year, as part of his solo band with the performance being released the same year as 99 Live. In 2002, Tracii contributed guitars on the Clarke&#x27;s solo album &quot;Swag&quot;, with some of these tracks appearing on the 2007 compilation album &quot;Gilby Clarke&quot;. Also in 1999, Tracii released his debut album &quot;Killing Machine&quot;, which was later re-released in 2004 with the new title of &quot;All Eyes are Watchin″&quot;.

Guns was also in Poison for a short time in early 2000, when C.C. DeVille departed the band for a month over a dispute. Guns joined Quiet Riot in December 2005, a move that was to be short lived; he left less than a month later.

In 2004, Guns featured on the album &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, the album featuring the original demos by Hollywood Rose, on tracks remixed by Gilby Clarke.

In 2007, Guns guested on the debut album &quot;Dopesnake&quot; by Hollywood Roses along with Mick Taylor formerly of The Rolling Stones, Phil Lewis and Paul Black both also of L.A. Guns, Gilby Clarke formerly of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Rock Star Supernova, Fred Coury of Cinderella and formerly of London, Teddy Andreadis, Pat Travers and Hollywood Rose founder Chris Weber.

In October 2008, Steven Adler had formed a new supergroup with Guns called Guns of Destruction. The band&#x27;s lineup rounded up by Adler&#x27;s Appetite and Enuff Z&#x27;Nuff bassist Chip Z&#x27;nuff and singer Eric Dover of Sextus and formerly of Jellyfish and Slash&#x27;s Snakepit. They were to make their live debut at the Key Club in Hollywood on November, 19 with &quot;very special guests&quot; in attendance. However the group was to be short lived and Dover soon announced that he was not involved in the project.

After performing together at the &quot;Giving 2010&quot; benefit event on May 3, 2010, Guns formed the cover band &quot;Carnival of Dogs&quot; with Matt Sorum (Velvet Revolver, Camp Freddy, formerly of Guns N&#x27; Roses and The Cult), Franky Perez (Solo, Scars on Broadway, DKFXP, Apocalyptica) and Phil Soussan (formerly of Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol and Vince Neil).

In 2012, Guns worked with Italian producer Pietro Foresti on the song &quot;America Dreaming&quot; with Italian band J27.

In 2013, Guns joined the band of the production &quot;Raiding the Rock Vault&quot; at the Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.

In 2014 Guns formed the Devil City Angels, featuring Brandon Gibbs (Cheap Thrills) vocals, Rikki Rockett (Poison) drums &amp; Eric Brittingham (Cinderella) Bass. The self-titled debut album was officially released September 11, 2015.

== Personal life ==
Ulrich has two sons. The elder, Jagger James Ulrich from his long-term relationship with fiancee Kristen, is named after Mick Jagger. His younger son, Ole Luk Ulrich with ex-wife Siri Luk, is named after bassist Ole Beich and his ex-wife&#x27;s uncle, black metal guitarist Ole Luk. Ulrich has two signature guitars named after his sons.

Ulrich has jokingly referred to his bassist Jeremy Guns (born Jeremy Carson) as his son. Several media outlets have mistakenly reported that Jeremy is Ulrich&#x27;s actual son.

<doc id="1137200" wikidata="Q5142384" url="?curid=1137200" title="Cold Station 12">
<text>&quot;Cold Station 12&quot; is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the eighty-first episode overall. It was directed by Mike Vejar from a script by Alan Brennert, and aired on November 5, 2004, on UPN. It comprises the middle-act of a three-episode arc, preceded by &quot;Borderland&quot; and followed by &quot;The Augments&quot;.

The series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. In this episode, after leaving &quot;Enterprise&quot; stranded, Doctor Arik Soong and his Augments travel to &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;, a secretive pathogen and bio-medical facility run by Starfleet Medical and the Denobulans, where much of this episode&#x27;s plot unfolds. Once inside, they begin torturing the scientists with the goal of retrieving some 1,800 augmented embryos, allowing them to expand their race.

The production team created several new sets to represent the space station itself, as well as re-using some from &quot;Borderland&quot; to represent the Klingon starship. The make-up team were required to make Brent Spiner look younger for flashbacks and to show the progression of a character&#x27;s exposure to a number of pathogens. The story-arc has been considered one of the best seen in &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and critics praised &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;, specifically for the special effects and character development, but felt that the death scene crossed the line. On first broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.1 percent of the population according to Nielsen ratings, placing it in fifth position for the timeslot.

==Plot==
After the escape of Doctor Soong and the Augments, Captain Archer and his crew proceed to the coordinates Soong had provided earlier in the mission. On Trialis IV, the away team find an abandoned building where the young Augments were raised and schooled by &quot;father&quot; Soong. They also capture a banished member of the Augments named Udar. Nicknamed &quot;Smike&quot; by his Augment siblings after a handicapped character from the comic novel Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens, he is taken to &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Analysis reveals that although Udar&#x27;s DNA is similar to the other Augments, he has none of their enhanced abilities (except for superior hearing).

Meanwhile, Soong and the Augments capture &quot;Barzai&quot;, a Denobulan medical ship, and use it to enter the medical facility called Cold Station 12 (C-12). They soon overpower security and capture the scientists there, including its chief medical officer, Doctor Jeremy Lucas (Doctor Phlox&#x27;s Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart). Due to security protocols, tensions begin to surface between Soong and Malik, as to how to coerce Lucas into divulging the entry codes. Malik convinces Soong to torture Lucas, and failing that, to expose a scientist to a deadly pathogen using a containment chamber.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; approaches within transporter range, and beams a landing party (including Phlox) to the facility. They are soon detected, however, and imprisoned with the facility&#x27;s staff. Meanwhile, Commander T&#x27;Pol, having lost contact with the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox&#x27;s friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself to a number of pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail.

==Production==
The episode was the second of a three-part storyline, which was intended to link &quot;Enterprise&quot; more closely to &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; with the return of genetically engineered &quot;Augments&quot; which had appeared alongside Khan Noonian Singh in &quot;Space Seed&quot; and the movie &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. It was preceded by the episode &quot;Borderland&quot;, and followed by &quot;The Augments&quot;. Production on the episode began on August 24, 2004, and concluded on September 1. There were several swing sets created for the episode, specifically to cover the scenes filmed on board the station. It re-used the sets created for &quot;Borderland&quot; to represent the Klingon vessel captured by the Augments. There were also sets created to represent the compound where Soong raised the genetically altered humans, which was set up different as flashbacks to the character&#x27;s childhoods were also shot for this episode. It was directed by Mike Vejar, who had directed several earlier episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, most recently &quot;Stratagem&quot;. It was written by Consulting Producer Alan Brennert, his first writing credit in the franchise.

There was some specific work required by the make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go through a series of levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot.

There were several guest actors in &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;. The character, Dr. Jeremy Lucas, had been previously mentioned in the episodes &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; and &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; as a friend of Phlox. But &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; marked the first occasion that the character appeared on screen, played by Richard Riehle. The actor had previously appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Inner Light&quot; as well as the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episodes &quot;Fair Haven&quot; and the follow-up episode &quot;Spirit Folk&quot;. Guest stars Spiner, Alec Newman and Abby Brammell resumed their roles from the previous episode in the trilogy, &quot;Borderland&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Cold Station 12&quot; was first broadcast on November 5, 2004, on UPN. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 2.1 percent of the population of the United States and by four percent of those watching television at the time. This put it in fifth place for the 8pm timeslot, behind &quot;Totally Outrageous Behavior&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Craziest Videos&quot; on Fox. It had an average of 3.4 million viewers. Brent Spiner was credited for the ratings boost, the best of season so far.

Bill Gordon, writing for the website Sci-Fi Pulse, said that it was a &quot;nearly flawless episode&quot;, with his one critique in his analysis of the plot being targeted at Captain Archer telling Soong that they were sending over the self-destruct code for the station. He said that there was an &quot;epic&quot; quality to &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; that made him compare it to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film franchise, saying that it had &quot;stellar FX shots, to first class character and story development, to a quality of writing that has been sadly lacking in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe of late.&quot;

&quot;IGN&quot; gave the episode two out of five, and saying that it &quot;lacks some of the flair of its predecessor and seems to take some storytelling shortcuts to get where it&#x27;s going, making it feel more like the usual &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode rather than something special&quot;, but hopes that the next episode will be able to deliver on the promise of the arc&#x27;s ambitious premise. 
Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation praised the episode, saying it was an improvement on &quot;Borderland&quot; and that Spiner was even better. But she found the murder of the doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far. She said that themes raised in &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; mirrored those which could have appeared on &quot;The Original Series&quot;, but that this episode didn&#x27;t take the time to discuss them. She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. 
&quot;Aint It Cool News&quot; gave it three out of five.

The mini-arc featuring the episodes &quot;Borderland&quot;, &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; and &quot;The Augments&quot; were ranked the sixth best story of &quot;Enterprise&quot; by &quot;Den of Geek&quot; writer James Hunt. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised casting Brent Spiner as the character Arik Soong.

The University of Dubuque included viewing of &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; alongside the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Beast Below&quot; in the course &quot;Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who&quot; to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many.

===Awards===
Alongside his work on the previous episode &quot;Borderland&quot;, Vince Deadrick, Jr.&#x27;s work on &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination. The award was won by Matt Taylor for his work on &quot;24&quot;.

==Home media release==
&quot;Cold Station 12&quot; was as part of the season the four DVD box set of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray release of the fourth season of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was on April 1, 2014.

<doc id="1137210" wikidata="Q390383" url="?curid=1137210" title="Pocketknife">
<text>A pocketknife is a knife with one or more blades that fold into the handle. They are also known as jackknives, folding knives, EDC knife, or may be referred to as a [[penknife]], though a penknife may also be a specific kind of pocketknife. A typical blade length is .

Pocketknives are versatile tools, and may be used for anything from whittling and woodcarving, to butchering small game, gutting and filleting small fish, aiding in the preparation of tinder and kindling for fires, boring holes in soft material, to opening an envelope, cutting twine, slicing fruits and vegetables or as a means of self-defense.

Pocketknives may also be used in conjunction with other tools and equipment for woodcraft and bushcraft.

Specialised designs are also used for mushroom hunting and gardening. Pocketknives designed for gardening include pruning knives, which are folding knives with long curved blades used for pruning, trimming cuttings, taking buds and preparing material for grafting. 
== History ==
The earliest known pocketknives date to at least the early Iron Age. A pocketknife with a bone handle was found at the Hallstatt Culture type site in Austria, dating to around 600–500 BCE. Iberian folding-blade knives made by indigenous artisans and craftsmen and dating to the pre-Roman era have been found in Spain. Many folding knives from the Viking Age have been found. They carried some friction binders, but more often they seem to have used folding knives that used a closure to keep the blade open.

== Peasant knife==
The peasant knife, farmer knife, or penny knife is the original and most basic design of a folding pocketknife, using a simple pivoted blade that folds in and out of the handle freely, without a backspring, slipjoint, or blade locking mechanism. The first peasant knives date to the pre-Roman era, but were not widely distributed nor affordable by most people until the advent of limited production of such knives in cutlery centers such as Sheffield, England commencing around 1650, with large-scale production starting around the year 1700 with models such as &quot;Fuller&#x27;s Penny Knife&quot; and the &quot;Wharncliffe Knife&quot;. Some peasant knives used a bolster or tensioning screw at the blade to apply friction to the blade tang in order to keep the blade in the open position. The smallest (Nos. 2–5) Opinel knives are an example of the peasant knife. The knife&#x27;s low cost made it a favorite of small farmers, herdsmen, and gardeners in Europe and the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th century.

== Slip joint knife ==
Most pocketknives for light duty are slipjoints. This means that the blade does not lock but, once opened, is held in place by tension from a flat bar or leaf-type backspring that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of pressure is applied. The first spring-back knives were developed around 1660 in England, but were not widely available until the Industrial Revolution and development of machinery capable of mass production. Many locking knives have only one blade that is as large as can be fitted into the handle, because the locking mechanism relies on a spring-loaded latch built into the spine or frame of the handle to lock it and it is difficult to build in multiple levers, one for each blade. Slipjoints tend to be smaller than other typical pocketknives.

Some popular patterns of slipjoint knives include:

=== Multi-tool knives ===

Multi-tool knives formerly consisted of variations on the American &quot;camper&quot; style or the &quot;Swiss Army&quot; knives manufactured by Victorinox and Wenger. However, the concept of a multitool knife has undergone a revolution thanks in part to an avalanche of new styles, sizes, and tool presentation concepts. These new varieties often incorporate a pair of pliers and other tools in conjunction with one or more knife blade styles, either locking or nonlocking.

Multitool knives often have more than one blade, including an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, saws) as well as a selection of other tools such as bottle openers, corkscrews, and scissors. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction. The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in the camper or scout pattern and has an extremely large clevis or bail. The Victorinox Swiss Army Soldier Knife has been issued a National Stock Number (NSN) to be authorized for issue to US service members. This is the first time a US military issued utility/pocket knife that was not manufactured in the United States has been adopted.

=== Miscellaneous designs ===
Another style of folding, non-locking knife is the friction-folder. These use simple friction between the blade and scales to hold the blade in place once opened; an example is the Japanese higonokami.

An electrician&#x27;s knife typically has a locking screwdriver blade but a non-locking knife blade. The two-blade Camillus Electrician&#x27;s knife (the US military version is known as a TL-29) was the inspiration for the development of the linerlock.

A credit card knife is usually a very thin knife that is the shape and size of a credit card, either when folded into a knife shape or unfolded for storage. It is designed to be carried in a wallet along with regular credit cards. Some credit card knives can contain other small tools, such as tweezers, or toothpicks.

A ballpoint pen knife is generally a pen with a concealed knife inside, which can be used as a letter opener or as a self-defense weapon.

== Lock-blade knives ==

Knives with locking blades, often referred to as &quot;lock-blade knives&quot; or &quot;clasp knives&quot;, have a locking mechanism that locks the blade into its fully opened position. This lock must be released in a distinct action before the knife can be folded. The lock-blade knife improves safety by preventing accidental blade closure while cutting. It is this locking blade feature that differentiates the lock-blade knife from either the &quot;peasant knife&quot; or the &quot;slipjoint&quot; spring-back knife. Locking knives also tend to be larger: it is easier to fit a lock into a larger frame, and larger knives are more likely to be used for more forceful kinds of work. The cost of a locking mechanism is also proportionally less than it would be on a smaller, and generally cheaper, knife.

Lock-blade knives have been dated to the 15th century. In Spain, one early lock-blade design was the Andalusian &quot;clasp knife&quot; popularly referred to as the navaja. Opinel knives use a twist lock, consisting of a metal ferrule or barrel ring that is rotated to lock the blade either open or closed. In the late 20th century lock-blade pocketknives were popularized and marketed on a wider scale. Companies such as Buck Knives, Camillus, Case, and Gerber, created a wide range of products with locks of various types. The most popular form, the &quot;lockback knife&quot;, was popularized by Buck Knives in the 1960s, so much that the eponymous term &quot;buck knife&quot; was used to refer to lockback knives that were not manufactured by Buck.

The lockback&#x27;s blade locking mechanism is a refinement of the slipjoint design; both use a strong backspring located along the back of the knife handle. However, the lockback design incorporates a hook or lug on the backspring, which snaps into a corresponding notch on the blade&#x27;s heel when the blade is fully opened, locking the blade into position. Closing the blade requires the user to apply pressure to the spring-loaded bar located towards the rear of the knife handle to disengage the hook from the notch and thus release the blade.

The Walker Linerlock, invented by knifemaker Michael Walker, and the framelock came to prominence in the 1980s. In both designs the liner inside the knife is spring-loaded to engage the rear of the blade when open and thus hold it in place. In the case of the framelock, the liner is the handle, itself. The Swiss Army knife product range has adopted dual linerlocks on their 111 mm models. Some models feature additional &quot;positive&quot; locks, which essentially ensure that the blade cannot close accidentally. CRKT has patented an &quot;Auto-LAWKS&quot; device, which features a second sliding switch on the hilt. It can operate as any linerlock knife if so desired, but if the user slides the second control up after opening, it places a wedge between the linerlock and the frame, preventing the lock from disengaging until the second device is disabled.

=== Tactical folding knife ===

Buck&#x27;s original lockback knife was originally marketed as a &quot;folding hunting knife&quot; and while it became popular with sportsmen, it saw use with military personnel as it could perform a variety of tasks. Custom knife makers began making similar knives, in particular was knifemaker Bob Terzuola. Terzuola is credited with coining the phrase &quot;Tactical Folder&quot;.

In the early 1990s, tactical folding knives became popular in the U.S.A. The trend began with custom knifemakers such as Bob Terzuola, Michael Walker, Allen Elishewitz, Mel Pardue, Ernest Emerson, Ken Onion, Chris Reeve, Rick Hinderer, Warren Thomas, and Warren Osbourne. These knives were most commonly built as linerlocks. Blade lengths varied from , but the most typical models never exceeded in blade length for legal reasons in most US jurisdictions.

In response to the demand for these knives, production companies offered mass-produced tactical folding knives. Companies such as Benchmade, Kershaw Knives, Buck Knives, Gerber, CRKT, Spyderco and Cold Steel collaborated with tactical knifemakers; in some cases retaining them as full-time designers. Tactical knifemakers such as Ernest Emerson and Chris Reeve went so far as to open their own mass-production factories.

Presenting any folding knife as a weapon, rather than a utility tool, has met criticism. Many who&#x27;ve studied knife fighting point out that even the strongest locking mechanisms have some risk of failure, so a folding knife is never going to be as reliable as a fixed-blade combat knife. Lynn Thompson, martial artist and CEO of Cold Steel, noted in an article in &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine that most tactical folding knives are too short to be of much use in a knife fight. And while his company does make and sell a tactical folder, it is not the best option during an actual fight.

The case for tactical folding knives, then, is that a less-than-ideal knife in your pocket is always more useful than an ideal knife left at home. A 10-inch fixed-blade Bowie knife, for example, may be far better for combat, but it is far less practical — and often illegal — to carry around in day-to-day life. And should there be a need to take defensive action, there&#x27;s rarely enough forewarning to plan ahead which knife to carry that day.


== Other features ==

Traditional folding knives are opened using nail-nicks, or slots where the user&#x27;s fingernail would enter to pull the blade out of the handle. This became somewhat cumbersome and required use of two hands, so there were innovations to remedy that. The thumb-stud, a small stud on the blade that allows for one-handed opening, led the way for more innovations. One of these is the thumb hole: a Spyderco patent where the user presses the pad of the thumb against a hole and opens the blade by rotating the thumb similarly to using the thumb-stud.

Another innovation of Sal Glesser, Spyderco founder, was the clip system, which he named a &quot;Clip-it&quot;. Clips are usually metal or plastic and similar to the clips found on pens except thicker. Clips allow the knife to be easily accessible, while keeping it lint-free and unscathed by pocket items such as coins. Assisted opening systems have been pioneered by makers like Ken Onion with his &quot;Speed-Safe&quot; mechanism and Ernest Emerson&#x27;s Wave system, where a hook catches the user&#x27;s pocket upon removal and the blade is opened during a draw.

One of the first one handed devices was the automatic spring release, also known as a switchblade. An innovation to pocketknives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold &quot;Kit&quot; Carson often incorporate a &quot;Carson Flipper&quot;, which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user&#x27;s index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second &quot;Flipper&quot; on the opposite side of the blade, forming a small &quot;hilt guard&quot; such as a fixed blade knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat. These &quot;flippers&quot; are now being found on other brands of knives as well, such as Kershaw, even cheaper knives, including certain versions of Schrade&#x27;s &quot;Snowblind&quot; tactical folders, and numerous others.

== Legal issues ==


Pocketknives are legal to own in most countries, but may face legal restrictions on their use. While pocketknives are almost always designed as tools, they do have the potential to be considered by legal authorities as weapons.

In the United States, knives are regulated by federal, state, and municipal laws. Some jurisdictions prohibit the possession or use of pocketknives that feature locking blades. Others prohibit certain blade styles perceived by law enforcement and legal authorities as optimal for offensive fighting, transforming the pocketknife from a utility tool into a deadly weapon. These might include knives with dirk, dagger (double-edge), bowie, or stiletto blades. In some jurisdictions it is illegal to conceal knives larger than a certain size or with blades over a certain length, particularly when combined with locking blade mechanisms. The possession or carrying of a folding pocketknife with a quick-opening mechanism such as a gravity knife, butterfly knife (balisong), or switchblade may be prohibited. Under U.S. federal law, switchblades and ballistic knives are banned from interstate shipment, sale, or import, or possession on federal or Indian lands or U.S. possessions and may be prohibited entirely in some states. Knives of any size or configuration may be prohibited by federal or state laws in certain designated areas or places, such as schools, courthouses, jails, power plants, or airports.

In the United Kingdom it is illegal to carry a folding knife having a blade with a cutting edge of more than 3 inches (just over 7.6 cm) in length in public without &quot;good reason&quot;. The terms &quot;in public&quot; and &quot;good reason&quot; are not defined, but examples of &quot;religious duty&quot;, &quot;national dress&quot; and &quot;requirement of employment or hobby&quot; are given. It is left up to a police officer&#x27;s individual subjective discretion, and ultimately a magistrate to decide if a knife is being carried &quot;in public&quot;, and for a &quot;good reason&quot;. Folding knives with blades of or less may be carried without needing to provide &quot;good reason&quot; so long as the blade is not capable of being locked in the open position. However, it is illegal to have the intention of using any object in public as a weapon, meaning that even a knife that is legal to carry without needing &quot;good reason&quot; may still be found to be illegal if the police officer has grounds to suspect it will be used as a weapon. The onus lies on the officer to prove that intent. Recent court decisions in the U.K. have made it easier for public prosecutors to obtain knife possession convictions by preventing the accused from citing self-defence or even fear of attack as a justifiable reason for carrying a knife. The U.K. government advisory website on crime and justice formerly stated that &quot;even if you carry a knife to protect yourself or make yourself feel safer but don’t intend to use it then you are committing a crime.&quot;

<text>&quot;For the Texas businessman, see Hugh Roy Cullen.&quot;

Roy Cullen, (born December 30, 1944, in Montreal, Quebec) is a former politician who was a Liberal MP for the riding of Etobicoke North in the House of Commons of Canada.

==Background==
Cullen earned his Bachelor of Arts in business administration from Bishop&#x27;s University and his Master of Public Administration from the University of Victoria. He is a chartered accountant.

Prior to his first election to the House of Commons, Cullen was a vice-president of the Noranda Forest Group and served as an assistant deputy minister in the British Columbia Ministry of Forests. He was very active in the Salvation Army, Rotary International and the United Way.

In 2008, Cullen&#x27;s book &quot;The Poverty of Corrupt Nations&quot; was published by Blue Butterfly Book Publishing. In his second book, &quot;Beyond Question Period, or What really goes on in Ottawa&quot;, which was published in 2011, he chronicles the life of an MP In Ottawa beyond the rhetoric of the cut and thrust of Question Period.

==Politics==
He was first elected in a by-election in 1996 and was subsequently re-elected in the 1997 federal elections. He stayed as MP until 2008 when he announced his retirement. He served through four sessions of parliament.

He was elected and served as chair of the Ontario Liberal Caucus from 1998 to 1999. In 1999 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, and was re-appointed following the 2000 general election. In February 2004, Cullen was elected chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, and on July 20, 2004, Mr. Cullen was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

In June 2002, he was appointed to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Task Force on Canada/U.S. Relations and to the newly formed Standing Committee for Government Operations and Estimates. In December 2002, he was asked to co-chair the Subcommittee on Public Service Renewal. He also chaired the Liberal caucus Sub-Committee on Corporate Governance.

In the leadership contest called to replace Paul Martin as leader of the Liberal Party, he initially supported Maurizio Bevilacqua and subsequently supported Michael Ignatieff when Bevilacqua withdrew from the race.

In opposition, Cullen broke with the Liberal caucus in 2007 to vote with Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative government in favour of extending Canada&#x27;s NATO-authorized combat mission in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan for two years. In all, 30 Liberal MPs voted with the government which allowed the motion to narrowly pass 149–145. In 2008, Cullen also received publicity for allegedly stating in caucus that he would defy Liberal Party leader Stéphane Dion&#x27;s whip by voting again with the Conservative Government in further extending the combat mission indefinitely. This report was denied by Cullen. Cullen announced on February 21, 2008, that he would not run in the 2008 general election.

<text>Livingston Island (Russian name &quot;Smolensk&quot;, ) is an Antarctic island in the Southern Ocean, part of the South Shetlands Archipelago, a group of Antarctic islands north of the Antarctic Peninsula. It was the first land discovered south of 60° south latitude in 1819, a historic event that marked the end of a centuries-long pursuit of the mythical &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; and the beginning of the exploration and utilization of real Antarctica. The name Livingston, although of unknown derivation, has been well established in international usage since the early 1820s.

==Geography==
Livingston Island is situated in West Antarctica, northwest of Cape Roquemaurel on the Antarctic mainland, south-southeast of Cape Horn in South America, southeast of the Diego Ramírez Islands (the southernmost land of South America), due south of the Falkland Islands, southwest of South Georgia Islands, and from the South Pole.

The island is part of the South Shetlands archipelago, an islands chain extending in east-northeast to west-southwest direction, and separated from the nearby Antarctic Peninsula by Bransfield Strait, and from South America by the Drake Passage. The South Shetlands cover a total land area of (late 20th-century estimate; the current figure might be somewhat less than that due to coastal change), comprising (from east to west) the eleven principal islands of Clarence, Elephant, King George, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston, Deception, Snow, Low and Smith, and a number of minor islands, islets and rocks.

Livingston is separated from neighbouring Greenwich Island to the east by the -wide McFarlane Strait, and from Snow Island to the west-southwest by the -wide Morton Strait. Deception Island, situated in Bransfield Strait barely southwest of Livingston&#x27;s Barnard Point, is an active volcano last erupting in 1967, 1969 and 1970 whose flooded caldera forms the by sheltered harbour of Port Foster entered by a single wide passage known as Neptune&#x27;s Bellows. There are several extinct volcanoes on Livingston Island itself that were active in the Quaternary, such as Rezen Knoll, Gleaner Heights, Edinburgh Hill and Inott Point.
The island extends from Start Point in the west to Renier Point in the east, its width varying from at the neck between South Bay and Hero Bay to between Botev Point to the south and Williams Point to the north. Livingston is the second largest island in the archipelago after King George, with surface area of (early 21st-century estimate; the current figure might be somewhat smaller due to coastal change).

The coastline is irregular, with major indentations such as South Bay, False Bay, Moon Bay, Hero, Barclay, New Plymouth, Osogovo and Walker, and peninsulas such as Hurd ( long), Rozhen (), Burgas (), Varna (), Ioannes Paulus II () and Byers (). There are many islets and rocks lying in the surrounding waters, particularly off the north coast. More sizable among the adjacent minor islands are Rugged Island off Byers Peninsula, Half Moon Island in Moon Bay, Desolation Island in Hero Bay, and Zed Islands off Williams Point.

Ice cliffs, often withdrawing during recent decades to uncover new coves, beaches, spits, points and minor islands, form most of the coastline. Except for the ice-free Byers Peninsula and some isolated patches, the land surface is covered by an ice cap with ice domes and plateaus in the central and western areas, and a number of valley glaciers formed by the more mountainous relief of eastern Livingston. Certain areas of the ice cap, especially near glacier termini or over steeper slopes, are densely crevassed and almost inaccessible without specialized equipment. Elsewhere, the surface is smooth, hard and comfortable for walking, skiing or snowmobiling. However, the danger of falling into some hidden crevasse masked by a snow bridge is ever-present, including in frequently visited and supposedly well-known localities. Protracted periods of warmer weather tend to make the snow bridges more unstable and hazardous.

Typical of the island&#x27;s glaciology are the conspicuous ash layers originating from volcanic activity on neighbouring Deception Island. The island hosts also several rock glaciers consisting of rock debris frozen in ice, such as those at Nusha Hill, MacKay Peak and Renier Point.
Along with the extensive Byers Peninsula () forming the west extremity of Livingston, the ice-free part of the island includes some minor coastal areas at Cape Shirreff, Siddins Point, Hannah Point, Williams Point, Hurd Peninsula and Rozhen Peninsula, as well as slopes in the mountain ranges, and ridges and heights in eastern Livingston that are too precipitous to keep snow. Numerous meltwater streams flow in the ice-free areas during summer, extending from hundreds of meters up to 4.5 km. Byers Peninsula alone has more than 60 such streams and as many lakes, notably Midge Lake (587 by 112 m, or 642 by 122 yd), Limnopolar Lake and Basalt Lake. Several such streams, lakes and ponds are situated in the vicinity of the Bulgarian and Spanish bases on Hurd Peninsula.

The principal mountain formations on the island comprise Tangra Mountains ( long and wide, with Mt Friesland rising to ), Bowles Ridge ( long, elevation ), Vidin Heights (, ), Burdick Ridge (), Melnik Ridge () and Pliska Ridge () in the eastern part of the island, and Oryahovo Heights (, ), and Dospey Heights (, ). The local ice relief is prone to change; in December 2016 the elevations of Mount Friesland and St. Boris Peak were and respectively, making the latter the summit of Livingston in that season. According to the American high accuracy Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA), Mount Friesland is higher than St. Boris Peak.

The first ascent of the island&#x27;s Mount Friesland summit was made by the Catalans Francesc Sàbat and Jorge Enrique from Juan Carlos I Base on 30 December 1991. Of the other notable peaks of Tangra Mountains, Lyaskovets () was first summited by the Bulgarians Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev from Camp Academia on 14 December 2004, Great Needle Peak (Falsa Aguja Peak, ) – by the Bulgarians Doychin Boyanov, Nikolay Petkov and Aleksander Shopov from Camp Academia on 8 January 2015, St. Boris – by Boyanov and Petkov from Camp Academia on 22 December 2016, and Simeon () – by Boyanov, Petkov and Nedelcho Hazarbasanov from Nesebar Gap on 15 January 2017.

Of the island&#x27;s nature, Captain Robert Fildes of the sealers and (both of them shipwrecked in the South Shetlands) wrote in 1821:

==Climate==
The climate of Livingston is polar tundra under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. Climatic conditions are influenced by the following specific factors: the island&#x27;s location in the narrowest part of the Southern Ocean (less than 600 km between the Antarctic Convergence and the Antarctic Peninsula); the relatively small amplitude of water temperatures in the surrounding sea; the local relief including Tangra Mountains, one of the highest mountain ranges in the archipelago that contributes to shaping the local atmospheric circulation; and the ice cap of the island. Surface air temperature decreases with increasing altitudes, which in the interior of eastern Livingston Island reach 550 m at the centrally located Wörner Gap and over 1400 m at the crest of Tangra Mountains.

The local variety of the Antarctic Peninsula weather is particularly changeable, windy, humid and sunless. Says Australian mountaineer Damien Gildea who climbed in the area: ‘Livingston got just about the worst weather in the world’. A US seasonal field camp on Byers Peninsula was wrecked by storm and emergency evacuated in February 2009. Whiteouts are common, and blizzards can occur at any time of the year. Temperatures are rather constant, with diurnal temperature variations seldom exceeding a few degrees. Wind chill temperatures could be up to lower than actual ones. The highest daily temperature recorded on the island is (measured at the Chilean Base), and the lowest is (at the Spanish base).

Following a period of warming during the second half of the 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula region has experienced a period of cooling in the early 21st century. For Livingston Island this cooling has reached over the 12-year period 2004–2016, and for the summer average temperatures over the same period. That has resulted in a longer snow cover duration in the coastal ice-free areas, which could be exemplified by comparing the January snow line configurations shown on the 1996 and 2016 maps of the Bulgarian base.

It can rain or snow on Livingston Island at any time of the year, although in the winter most precipitation occurs in the form of snow.

==Flora and fauna==
Charles Darwin, 23 years old as he started his biological research in neighbouring Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and the Falklands in 1832, noted (with some inaccuracy in his distances):

The coastal areas of Livingston Island are home to a selection of vegetation and animal life typical for the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, including fur, elephant, Weddell, and leopard seals, and chinstrap, gentoo, Adélie and macaroni penguins. Several other seabirds, including skuas, southern giant petrel and Antarctic terns, nest on the island during the summer months.

Spanish biological research has identified 110 species of lichens and 50 of mosses on a territory of just at the Spanish base on Hurd Peninsula, the highest species diversity recorded from any single Antarctic locality.

==History==
It was only during the nineteenth century that any land was discovered in what is now the ‘political’ territory of Antarctica, and that land happened to be Livingston Island. The English merchant William Smith in his brig , while sailing to Valparaíso in early 1819, strayed from his route south of Cape Horn and on 19 February sighted Williams Point, the northeast extremity of Livingston. That was the first land ever discovered south of 60° south latitude, in what is now the Antarctic Treaty area.

Russian explorer von Bellingshausen commented on Smith&#x27;s discovery:


Several months later Smith revisited the South Shetlands, landed on King George Island on 16 October 1819 and claimed possession for Britain. In the meantime, a Spanish man-of-war had been damaged by severe weather in the Drake Passage and sank off the north coast of Livingston on 4 September 1819. The 74-gun ship &quot;San Telmo&quot; commanded by Captain Joaquín Toledo was the flagship of a Spanish naval squadron en route to Callao to fight the independence movement in Spanish America. The officers, soldiers and sailors on board the ship, including the squadron&#x27;s Peruvian-born leader Brigadier Rosendo Porlier, are the first recorded people to die in Antarctica. While no one survived, some of her spars and her anchor-stock were found subsequently by sealers on Half Moon Beach at Cape Shirreff.

During December 1819 William Smith was back with his ship to the South Shetlands. This time he was chartered by Captain William Shirreff, British commanding officer in the Pacific stationed in Chile, and accompanied by Lieutenant Edward Bransfield who was tasked to survey and map the new lands. On 30 January 1820 they sighted the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula, unaware that three days earlier the continent had already been discovered by the Russian Antarctic expedition of Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von Bellingshausen and Mihail Lazarev.
One year later, the Russians had circumnavigated Antarctica and arrived in the South Shetlands region. On 6 February 1821 they approached Livingston Island and observed eight British and American ships off Byers Peninsula. While sailing between Deception and Livingston, Bellingshausen met with American sealer Nathaniel Palmer, yet another pioneer of Antarctic exploration who is alleged to have sighted the mainland himself during the previous November. Palmer informed the Russians that seal hunting in the area was going at full steam, with Smith alone having taken 60,000 seal skins. The Antarctic sealing industry south of 60°S was initiated in the 1819/20 summer season by the early voyage of Joseph Herring (ship&#x27;s mate during Smith&#x27;s first visit) who stepped ashore in Hersilia Cove, Rugged Island on Christmas Day of 1819, followed by James Sheffield (with second mate, a 20-year-old Nathaniel Palmer), James Weddell, and possibly Carlos Timblón from Buenos Aires.

American historian Edouard Stackpole wrote of the early 19th century sealers:


As the seals were killed onshore the hunters used to spend protracted periods of time there, seeking refuge from the elements in purpose-built stone huts, tent bivouacs or natural caves. Livingston Island became the most populous place in Antarctica for a time, its dwellers exceeding 200 in number during the 1820–23 South Shetlands sealing rush. The principal sealer ‘settlements’ on the island were situated on Byers Peninsula, as well as at Cape Shirreff and Elephant Point. Argentine archaeological research has identified 26 human-built shelter structures on Byers Peninsula alone. There were some women among the early inhabitants of the island, as evidenced by a 1985 discovery of the grave of a 21-year-old woman of mixed European and Native American descent at Yamana Beach on Cape Shirreff, dated to the early 19th century. Remains of huts and sealer artefacts are still found on Livingston, which possesses the second greatest concentration of historical sites in Antarctica (after South Georgia). The memory of that epoch survives, other than in archaeological finds, also in a dozen preserved ship logs and as many memoirs, such as the candid story published in 1844 by one Thomas Smith who sailed to Livingston in the sealer &quot;Hetty&quot; under Captain Ralph Bond during the 1820/21 season.

Sealing was replaced by another rush of unsustainable commercial exploitation during the 20th century – Antarctic whaling. This time Livingston Island was not directly involved, although the southernmost Hektor Whaling Station was operated by Norway on nearby Deception Island from 1912 to 1931. Whaling likewise depleted its resource and gave way at the turn of the 1970s to modern Antarctic fishing industry pioneered by the fishing fleets of the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany and Bulgaria.

A significant milestone in Livingston Island&#x27;s history was the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 and entered into force in 1961, which effectively placed the region south of 60° south latitude under the joint governance of the consultative (voting) parties to the treaty, providing in particular for the freedom of scientific exploration. The treaty left the personnel of the Antarctic bases under their respective home countries’ jurisdiction, and essentially froze the existing sovereignty claims. (Livingston, in particular, was claimed by Britain in 1820 with letters patent of annexation promulgated in 1908, by Chile in 1940 and by Argentina in 1942 — claims not recognized, among others, by the US and Russia, which have formally reserved their rights to claim Antarctic territories.) Since then, the evolving Antarctic Treaty System has been providing an increasingly comprehensive legal framework for all Antarctic-related activities, including environmental protection and exploitation of marine living resources, and has proved an example of uniquely successful international cooperation.

On 15 September 1976, a Lockheed SP-2E Neptune (0644/2-P-103) of the Argentine Air Force disappeared on a flight from Río Grande after making radio contact at 12:15. The plane was found crashed into Monte Bernard here eight days later, with all 11 occupants killed.

==Toponymy==
The names of many geographical features on the island refer to its early history. Among the commemorated are ship captains such as the Americans James Sheffield, Christopher Burdick, Charles Barnard, Chester, Robert Johnson, Donald MacKay, Robert Inott, David Leslie, Benjamin Brunow, Robert Macy, Prince Moores, William Napier and Daniel Clark (first mate), the Britons William Shirreff, M’Kean, John Walker, Ralph Bond, Christopher MacGregor, T. Binn and William Bowles, the Australian Richard Siddins, people like the New York shipowner James Byers, the American whaling merchants William and Francis Rotch, British Admiralty hydrographer Thomas Hurd, and John Miers, publisher of the first chart of the South Shetland Islands based on the work of William Smith, or sealing vessels like &quot;Huron&quot;, &quot;Williams&quot; (William Smith&#x27;s brig), &quot;Hersilia&quot;, &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Gleaner&quot;, &quot;Huntress&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot;, &quot;Hannah&quot;, &quot;Henry&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot; (Nathaniel Palmer&#x27;s sloop), &quot;Cora&quot;, &quot;Hetty&quot;, &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;.

Some of the place names given by the nineteenth century sealers are descriptive, such as Devils Point, Hell Gates and Neck or Nothing Passage, hazardous places where ships and people were lost; False Bay, sometimes confused in thick weather with neighbouring South Bay; Needle Peak; Black Point; or the Robbery Beaches where American sealers were robbed of their sealskins by the British. However, names like Livingston, Mount Friesland, Ereby Point and Renier Point that also became established during the first few seasons after the discovery of the island remain of unknown origin.
&quot;Livingston&quot; was the third name of the island, introduced in 1821 by the British sealer Robert Fildes (as quoted above), replacing the popular early name &quot;Friesland Island&quot; (variously spelled also as Frieseland, Freesland, Freeseland, Frezeland, Freezland, Frezland and Freezeland) and the name &quot;Smolensk&quot; given by Bellingshausen in commemoration of one of the great battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The toponyms Friesland and Smolensk are now preserved as Mount Friesland and Smolensk Strait respectively. While the name &quot;Livingston&quot; is sometimes misspelt as &quot;Livingstone&quot;, it has nothing to do with the Scotsman David Livingstone, an 8-year-old boy in 1821 who was yet to become a cotton mill worker and still later a missionary and famous explorer of Africa.

Some place names on the island are given by Argentina and Chile, such as Charrúa Ridge, Scesa Point, Arroyo Point, Bruix Cove, Ocoa Point, Dreyfus Point, Mansa Cove, Agüero Point etc. Several Argentine names commemorate crewmen of the Argentine Navy Lockheed Neptune aircraft that crashed in poor weather on the then uninhabited island on 15 September 1976, killing 10 aircrew and a civilian television cameraman. Features like Point Smellie and Willan Nunatak are named after British scientists who have carried out field work on the island. Other names reflect the Spanish and Bulgarian exploration and mapping in the area, such as Española Cove, Mount Reina Sofía, San Telmo Island, Ballester Point and Castellvi Peak (after Antonio Ballester and Josefina Castellví, doyens of the Spanish Antarctic programme), Quiroga Ridge, Dañobeitia Crag, Ojeda Beach, Enrique Hill, Sàbat Hill, Casanovas Peak, Bulgarian Beach, Krum Rock (or Krumov Kamak), Pimpirev Beach (after Christo Pimpirev, doyen and leader of the Bulgarian Antarctic programme), Vergilov Ridge, Kuzman Knoll, Dimov Gate, Gurev Gap, Yankov Gap etc. Hespérides Point is named after BIO &quot;Hespérides&quot;, a Spanish Navy oceanographic vessel serving in particular as a resupply ship for the Spanish and Bulgarian bases for many years. Rongel Point and Las Palmas Cove are also named after modern Antarctic ships.

A concentration of place names (probably the highest in Antarctica) arising from local topographic diversity – over fifty names, mostly Chilean, occurs on the small ice-free headland forming the northern extremity of Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula and ending in Cape Shirreff.

==Scientific bases and camps==

The first modern, &#x27;post-sealer&#x27; habitation facility on Livingston Island was the British base camp Station P that operated during the 1957/58 summer season at South Bay, on the east side of the small ice-free promontory ending in Hannah Point. The scientific bases of Juan Carlos I (Spain) and St. Kliment Ohridski (Bulgaria; often shortened by non-Bulgarians to &quot;Ohridski Base&quot;, sometimes misspelt as &quot;Ohridiski&quot;) were established in early 1988 at South Bay, on the northwest coast of Hurd Peninsula. Doctor Guillermo Mann Base (Chile) and adjoining Cape Shirreff Field Station (USA) operate on Cape Shirreff since 1991 and 1996 respectively, while Cámara Base (Argentina) on the tiny nearby Half Moon Island is one of the early bases in the Antarctic Peninsula region established in 1953. These facilities are used also by visiting scientists from various nations; in particular, the Bulgarian base has hosted the first steps in Antarctic research by scientists from countries such as Portugal, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Mongolia and Turkey.

All four bases are permanent settlements, although inhabited only during the summer season. Their accommodation capacity is ca. 51, 18, 11 and 12 persons respectively, making it a total of 92 persons (80 for Livingston Island proper). The number of people inhabiting the bases in any particular season is actually greater as some of them stay for part of the time and are replaced by others.
Occasional or more permanent field camps support research in remote areas of the island. Camp Byers (Spain) operates regularly on the banks of Petreles Stream, South Beaches near Nikopol Point on Byers Peninsula; that site is also designated for use as an International Field Camp. The seasonal Camp Livingston (Argentina) is also situated on Byers Peninsula, while Sally Rocks Camp (Bulgaria) supported geological research on southern Hurd Peninsula. Camp Academia site situated at elevation in upper Huron Glacier, Wörner Gap area served as a base camp of the Tangra 2004/05 topographic survey. It is accessible by routes from St. Kliment Ohridski and Juan Carlos I base respectively, and offers convenient overland access to Tangra Mountains to the south; Bowles Ridge, Vidin Heights, Kaliakra Glacier and Saedinenie Snowfield areas to the north; Huron Glacier to the east; and Perunika Glacier and Huntress Glacier to the west. The site is named for the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in appreciation of its contribution to Antarctic exploration, and has been designated as the summer post office Tangra 1091 of the Bulgarian Posts since 2004. Field work done out of Camp Academia during the 2004/05 season was noted in 2012 by Discovery Channel, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Collection and the British Antarctic Survey as a timeline event in Antarctic exploration.

==Protected areas and sites==
In order to protect Antarctica, the Antarctic Treaty system enforces a strict general regime regulating human presence and activities on the continent, and designates certain protected territories where access is allowed only for scientific purposes, and with special permission.

There are two such nature reserves on Livingston Island established in 1966: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ASPA 149 Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Island, and ASPA 126 Byers Peninsula. These comprise respectively Byers Peninsula, which is the largest ice-free land area in the South Shetlands, and the small peninsula of Cape Shirreff together with Gerlovo Beach, nearby San Telmo Island and adjacent waters.

Subject of protection in ASPA 126 are the fossils demonstrating the link between Antarctica and other austral continents, a variety of abundant flora and fauna including colonies of seals and penguins that are the subject of scientific study and monitoring, as well as numerous historical monuments dating from the nineteenth century. This territory has been identified also as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its breeding colonies of Antarctic terns and kelp gulls. ASPA 149 features diverse plant and animal life, notably penguin and seal colonies including the largest fur seal breeding colony in the Antarctic Peninsula region. No longer hunted, fur seals have successfully re-colonized their original habitats on Livingston Island and elsewhere in the Antarctic Peninsula region.
The land boundary of ASPA 126 Byers Peninsula was shifted eastwards to 60º53&#x27;45&quot;W in 2016 to include along with Byers Peninsula also all ice-free ground and ice sheet west of Clark Nunatak and Rowe Point, increasing the overall surface area of that protected territory to . Two restricted zones of scientific importance to Antarctic microbiology have been further designated within these boundaries with greater restriction placed on access with the aim of preventing microbial or other contamination by human activity: Ray Promontory in the west, and Ivanov Beach and northwestern Rotch Dome in the east.

There are two Historic Sites or Monuments of Antarctica on the island: San Telmo Cairn (HSM 59) at Cape Shirreff, which commemorates the 644 Spaniards lost on board the &quot;San Telmo&quot; in 1819, and the Lame Dog Hut (HSM 91) at St. Kliment Ohridski base, which is the oldest preserved building on Livingston Island and together with its associated artefacts is considered a part of the cultural and historic heritage of the island and Antarctica. The hut hosts the &quot;Livingston Island Museum&quot;, a branch of the National Museum of History in Sofia.

==Tourism==


Antarctic shipborne tourism was initiated in the 1957/58 season with four cruises operated by Chile and Argentina in the South Shetland Islands. Since then the number of tourists visiting Antarctica has grown to several tens of thousands annually. Over 95% of them tour the South Shetlands and the nearby Antarctic Peninsula. Hannah Point on the south coast of Livingston, Half Moon Island off its east coast, Aitcho Islands just north of Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are among the most popular destinations. Tourists arrive mainly in cruise ships, and are landed by Zodiac rigid inflatable boats to walk along designated trails led by tourist guides and enjoy picturesque scenery and wildlife. Zodiac boats are the preferred means of local sea transport, being particularly suitable for navigation among floating ice and landing at places lacking port facilities. Naturally, this is only possible in summer as the sea surface is partially or completely frozen in ice over one meter thick in winter. Visits by yachts and extreme tourism such as kayaking have become increasingly popular, too.

Cruise ships visiting Hannah Point occasionally make a sightseeing detour to the Bulgarian base, where the tourists could visit the Livingston Island Museum established in October 2012, the old and new chapels of St. Ivan Rilski – the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica consecrated in February 2003, and the Monument to the Cyrillic Script erected on Pesyakov Hill in March 2018. Livingston Island has some particular relationship with the Cyrillic alphabet as the modern system for the Romanization of Bulgarian was developed in 1995 for use in Bulgarian-related place names on the island by the Antarctic Place-names Commission, and later became official for Bulgaria, UK, USA and UN.

The northeasternmost slopes of Tangra Mountains between Elena Peak and Renier Point together with the adjacent portion of Sopot Ice Piedmont are a popular site for backcountry skiing and climbing, with skiers landed by Zodiac boats from cruise ships visiting Half Moon Island&#x27;s vicinity.

==Honours==
Several squares and streets in Bulgarian towns and cities are named after Livingston Island, such as &quot;Livingston Island Square&quot; in Samuil and Kula, and &quot;Livingston Island Street&quot; in Gotse Delchev, Yambol, Petrich, Sofia, Lovech and Vidin.

==In popular culture==

* The area of the Spanish and Bulgarian bases on Livingston Island is the setting of the book &quot;Las aventuras de Piti en la Antártida&quot; by the Spanish author and polar explorer Javier Cacho.
* The British romantic novelist Rosie Thomas (pseudonym of Janey King) wrote her book &quot;Sun at Midnight&quot; at the Bulgarian base during the 2002/03 austral summer.
* The island contributes to the mise-en-scène of the 2016 Antarctica thriller novel &quot;The Killing Ship&quot; by Simon Beaufort (joint alias of Elizabeth Cruwys and Beau Riffenburgh), with action spreading from Hannah Point to Byers Peninsula via Ivanov Beach, skirting Verila Glacier and Rotch Dome in the process.
* The naming of St. Boris Peak after a Bulgarian saint was reminded by the British press in connection with the victory of Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election on 2 May 2008, that particular day being St. Boris&#x27;s Day in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.
* The cover of the VA album &quot;Under Heaven: Vinson Massif (2010)&quot; actually features not a photo of Vinson Massif but one of Livingston&#x27;s Elena, Yavorov and Delchev Peaks instead. Both the picture and the misidentification may have possibly originated in the ‘Vinson Massif’ entry of the ‘Seven Summits Quest’ website.

<text>Tinea or ringworm is any of a variety of skin mycoses. Tinea is a very common fungal infection of the skin. Tinea is often called &quot;ringworm&quot; because the rash is circular, with a ring-like appearance.

It is sometimes equated with dermatophytosis, and, while most conditions identified as &quot;tinea&quot; are members of the imperfect fungi that make up the dermatophytes, conditions such as tinea nigra and tinea versicolor are not caused by dermatophytes.

== &quot;Tinea pedis&quot; (foot) ==
Athlete&#x27;s foot (also known as &quot;ringworm of the foot&quot;, &quot;tinea pedum&quot;, and &quot;moccasin foot&quot;) is a common and contagious skin disease that causes itching, scaling, flaking, and sometimes blistering of the affected areas. Its medical name is &quot;tinea pedis&quot;, a member of the group of diseases or conditions known as tinea, most of which are dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin), which in turn are mycoses (broad category of fungal infections). Globally, athlete&#x27;s foot affects about 15% of the population.

Tinea pedis is caused by fungi such as &quot;Epidermophyton floccosum&quot; or fungi of the genus &quot;Trichophyton&quot; including &quot;T. rubrum&quot; and &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot;. These fungi are typically transmitted in moist communal areas where people go barefoot, such as around swimming pools or in showers, and require a warm moist environment like the inside of a shoe to incubate. Fungal infection of the foot may be acquired (or reacquired) in many ways, such as by walking in an infected locker room, by using an infested bathtub, by sharing a towel used by someone with the disease, by touching the feet with infected fingers (such as after scratching another infected area of the body), or by wearing fungi-contaminated socks or shoes.

Infection can often be prevented by keeping the feet dry by limiting the use of footwear that enclose the feet, or by remaining barefoot.

The fungi may infect or spread to other areas of the body (such as by scratching one&#x27;s feet and then touching one&#x27;s groin). For each location on the body, the name of the condition changes. A fungal infection of the groin is called &quot;Tinea cruris&quot;, or commonly &quot;jock itch&quot;. The fungi tend to spread to areas of skin that are kept warm and moist, such as with insulation (clothes), body heat, and sweat.

However, the spread of the infection is not limited to skin. Toe nails become infected with fungi in the same way as the rest of the foot, typically by being trapped with fungi in the warm, dark, moist inside of a shoe. Fungal infection of the nails is called tinea unguium, and is not included in the medical definition of &quot;athlete&#x27;s foot&quot;, even though toe nails are part of the foot. Fungi are more difficult to kill inside and underneath a nail than on and in the skin. But if the nail infection is not cured, then the fungi can readily spread back to the rest of the foot. The fungi can also spread to hair, grow inside hair strands, and feed on the keratin within hair, including the hair on the feet, the hair of one&#x27;s beard, and the hair on one&#x27;s head. From hair, the fungi can spread back to skin.

To effectively treat athlete&#x27;s foot, it is necessary to treat the entire infection, wherever it is on the body, until the fungi are dead and the skin has fully healed. There is a wide array of over the counter and prescription topical medications in the form of liquids, sprays, powders, ointments, and creams for killing fungi that have infected the feet or the body in general. For persistent conditions, oral medications are available by prescription.

== &quot;Tinea unguium&quot; (nails) ==
Onychomycosis (also known as &quot;dermatophytic onychomycosis&quot;, or &quot;tinea unguium&quot; is a fungal infection of the nail. It is the most common disease of the nails and constitutes about half of all nail abnormalities.

This condition may affect toenails or fingernails, but toenail infections are particularly common. It occurs in about 10% of the adult population.

== &quot;Tinea manuum&quot; (hand) ==
&quot;Tinea manuum&quot; (or &quot;tinea manus&quot;) is a fungal infection of the hand. It is typically more aggressive than tinea pedis but similar in look. Itching, burning, cracking, and scaling are observable and may be transmitted sexually or otherwise, whether or not symptoms are present.

== &quot;Tinea cruris&quot; (groin) ==
&quot;Tinea cruris&quot;, also known as &quot;crotch itch&quot;, &quot;crotch rot&quot;, &quot;Dhobie itch&quot;, &quot;eczema marginatum&quot;, &quot;gym itch&quot;, &quot;jock itch&quot;, &quot;jock rot&quot;, &quot;scrot rot&quot; and &quot;ringworm of the groin&quot; is a dermatophyte fungal infection of the groin region in any sex, though more often seen in males. In the German sprachraum this condition is called &quot;tinea inguinalis&quot; (from Latin = groin) whereas &quot;tinea cruris&quot; is used for a dermatophytosis of the lower leg (Latin &quot;&quot;).

Tinea cruris is similar to Candidal intertrigo, which is an infection of the skin by &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. It is more specifically located between intertriginous folds of adjacent skin, which can be present in the groin or scrotum, and be indistinguishable from fungal infections caused by &quot;tinia&quot;. However, candidal infections tend to both appear and disappear with treatment more quickly. It may also affect the scrotum.

== &quot;Tinea corporis&quot; (body) ==
&quot;Tinea corporis&quot; (also known as &quot;ringworm&quot;, &quot;tinea circinata&quot;, and &quot;tinea glabrosa&quot;) is a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the arms and legs, especially on glabrous skin; however, it may occur on any part of the body, it present as annular, marginated plaque with thin scale and clear center. Common organism are &quot;Trichophyton&quot; &quot;mentagrophytes&quot; and &quot;Micosporum canis.&quot; Treatments include grisofluvine, itraconazole and clotrimazole cream.

== &quot;Tinea capitis&quot; (scalp) ==
&quot;Tinea capitis&quot; (also known as &quot;Herpes tonsurans&quot;, &quot;Ringworm of the hair&quot;, &quot;Ringworm of the scalp&quot;, &quot;Scalp ringworm&quot;, and &quot;Tinea tonsurans&quot;) is a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the scalp. The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes of the genera &quot;Trichophyton&quot; and &quot;Microsporum&quot; that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically single or multiple patches of hair loss, sometimes with a &#x27;black dot&#x27; pattern (often with broken-off hairs), that may be accompanied by inflammation, scaling, pustules, and itching. Uncommon in adults, tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-pubertal children, more often boys than girls.

At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of &quot;Trichophyton&quot; infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from &quot;Microsporum&quot; species are mainly in South America, Southern and Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans, animals, or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp, without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral antifungal agent; griseofulvin is the most commonly used drug, but other newer antimycotic drugs, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have started to gain acceptance, topical treatment include selenium sulfide shampoo.

== &quot;Tinea faciei&quot; (face) ==
&quot;Tinea faciei&quot; is a fungal infection of the face.

It generally appears as a red rash on the face, followed by patches of small, raised bumps. The skin may peel while it is being treated.

Tinea faciei is contagious just by touch and can spread easily to all regions of skin.

== &quot;Tinea barbae&quot; (beard) ==
&quot;Tinea barbæ&quot; (also known as &quot;Barber&#x27;s itch&quot;, &quot;Ringworm of the beard&quot;, and &quot;Tinea sycosis&quot;) is a fungal infection of the hair. Tinea barbae is due to a dermatophytic infection around the bearded area of men. Generally, the infection occurs as a follicular inflammation, or as a cutaneous granulomatous lesion, i.e. a chronic inflammatory reaction. It is one of the causes of folliculitis. It is most common among agricultural workers, as the transmission is more common from animal-to-human than human-to-human. The most common causes are &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot; and &quot;T. verrucosum&quot;.

== &quot;Tinea imbricata&quot; (overlapping pattern) ==
&quot;Tinea imbricata&quot; (also known as &quot;Tokelau&quot;) is a superficial fungal infection of the skin limited to southwest Polynesia, Melanesia, Southeast Asia, India, and Central America.

It is associated with &quot;Trichophyton concentricum&quot;.

== &quot;Tinea nigra&quot; (black) ==
&quot;Tinea nigra&quot; (also known as &quot;superficial phaeohyphomycosis&quot;, and &quot;Tinea nigra palmaris et plantaris&quot;) is a superficial fungal infection that causes dark brown to black painless patches on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

== &quot;Tinea versicolor&quot; (various colors) ==
&quot;Tinea versicolor&quot; (also known as &quot;dermatomycosis furfuracea&quot;, &quot;pityriasis versicolor&quot;, and &quot;tinea flava&quot;) is a condition characterized by a skin eruption on the trunk and proximal extremities, hypopigmentation macule in area of sun induced pigmentation. During the winter the pigment becomes reddish brown. Recent research has shown that the majority of tinea versicolor is caused by the &quot;Malassezia globosa&quot; fungus, although &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot; is responsible for a small number of cases. These yeasts are normally found on the human skin and only become troublesome under certain circumstances, such as a warm and humid environment, although the exact conditions that cause initiation of the disease process are poorly understood. Treatment include [griseofulivin], topical selenium shampoo and topical ketoconazole.

The condition pityriasis versicolor was first identified in 1846. Versicolor comes from the Latin, from &quot;&quot; to turn + color.

== &quot;Tinea incognito&quot; (disguised) ==
&quot;Tinea incognito&quot; is a fungal infection (mycosis) of the skin caused by the presence of a topical immunosuppressive agent. The usual agent is a topical corticosteroid (topical steroid). As the skin fungal infection has lost some of the characteristic features due to suppression of inflammation, it may have a poorly defined border, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and florid growth. Occasionally, secondary infection with bacteria occurs with concurrent pustules and impetigo.

<text>James Karygiannis ( ; , ; born May 2, 1955) is a former Canadian politician. He served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal MP from 1988 to 2014, and as member of the Toronto City Council from 2014 until 2020, when his seat was vacated due to campaign spending violations.

Karygiannis served concurrently as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal (2005) and was previously parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport (2003–2005).

In opposition, Karygiannis attracted substantive attention from the media and various ethnic community groups as he took polemical stances on foreign policy issues and as part of his role as multiculturalism critic.

On April 1, 2014, he resigned his seat as a Member of Parliament in order to stand in the Toronto municipal election for Toronto City Councillor in Ward 39, and subsequently was elected to that seat. In November 2019, Karygiannis was removed from office for exceeding election expenses in the 2018 municipal election. He was then reinstated and removed twice during the ensuing legal saga that resulted in his final removal from office on September 24, 2020.

==Personal life==
Karygiannis was born in Athens, Greece. Before entering politics, Karygiannis was a businessman and industrial engineer. He immigrated to Canada in 1966, and has a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto. He also holds a degree of Fellowship of Business Administration from the Canadian School of Management. He is married with five daughters.

==Politics==
Karygiannis has been involved with politics as a Liberal since the late 1980s, first in provincial politics and later as a federal MP. He ran as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1987 provincial election. He lost to David Reville of the Ontario New Democratic Party by about 1,500 votes. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons the following year in the federal election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent W. Paul McCrossan by 858 votes in the newly created riding of Scarborough—Agincourt.

Karygiannis was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. In June 2005, however, he strongly criticized other socially-conservative Liberals who had threatened to bring down the government on the marriage issue.

===In government===
He won a landslide re-election in the 1993 federal election as the Liberals won a majority government, and was easily re-elected in subsequent federal elections.

Karygiannis was a prominent Toronto organizer for Jean Chrétien in the Liberal Party&#x27;s 1990 leadership contest, and was credited with delivering considerable support to Chrétien from the city&#x27;s Greek community.

In 2002, Karygiannis was voted &quot;laziest MP&quot; in a poll of Parliamentary staffers by &quot;The Hill Times&quot;.

Known as a Chrétien loyalist throughout the 1990s, Karygiannis announced in 2002 that he would support Paul Martin in the next Liberal leadership contest. In making his decision, he told an interviewer that it was time for Chrétien to retire &quot;with dignity&quot;, rather than risk a potentially divisive leadership review. When Martin became Liberal party leader on December 12, 2003, he appointed Karygiannis as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport.

In April 2004, Karygiannis brought forward a private member&#x27;s motion which recognized the death of 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923 as a genocide. The motion was approved by parliament 153 to 68, with support among Liberal backbench and opposition MPs, though Prime Minister Martin and his cabinet did not show up for the free vote and insisted that the motion is non-binding. Foreign Minister Bill Graham has defended the government&#x27;s position that the event constituted a &quot;tragedy&quot; rather than the purposeful extermination of minority Armenians. In response to Martin&#x27;s assertion that foreign policy rests with the cabinet, Karygiannis said that a clear majority of Parliament saw it differently and urged Martin to live up to his promise to give MPs real clout. The Turkish government was strongly critical of the motion and argued that Canadian MPs were rewriting history, while the Turkish Embassy suggested that relations between the two countries would be harmed as a result. Local press has also described his genocide recognition cause as one that &quot;splits cultural communities&quot;.

Karygiannis played a prominent role in organizing Toronto-area support for victims of the December 2004 earthquake in Southeast Asia. He called for cooperation between the city&#x27;s Tamil and Sinhalese communities for the relief effort in Sri Lanka, and personally travelled to Sri Lanka to witness the tsunami devastation firsthand. He was later criticized by fellow Member of Parliament David Kilgour for traveling to an area of Sri Lanka dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers), as the faction was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many countries. Karygiannis defended his decision, saying that his intent was to confirm that disaster aid was reaching the region. Despite Kilgour&#x27;s concerns, Karygiannis&#x27;s travels did not provoke a diplomatic incident with Sri Lanka.

In March 2005, Karygiannis travelled to Guyana to witness the damage that recent floods had done in the country. He helped to secure CIDA aid for Guyana of over million Canadian.

When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in September 2005, Karygiannis was one of the first Canadian parliamentarians to organize a Canadian relief effort.

===In opposition===
Karygiannis was the National Chairman for MP Joe Volpe&#x27;s campaign to lead the Liberal Party of Canada, but he resigned on July 21, 2006, over disagreements with Volpe&#x27;s pro-Israeli stance on the conflict in Lebanon.

On July 26, 2006, Karygiannis said that he was considering a run for the Liberal leadership himself because he felt the other candidates were &quot;lacking&quot; on the issue of foreign policy. At the leadership convention, he supported Bob Rae, but then threw his support to Stéphane Dion when Rae was eliminated from the ballot.

In September 2007, the Canadian government announced that it would recognize the country Macedonia as the &quot;Republic of Macedonia&quot; rather than by its previous designation as the &quot;Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&quot; This decision was criticized by the government of Greece, which claims the name Macedonia as its own. Karygiannis also opposed the government&#x27;s decision and indicated that the Greek-Canadian community would mobilize against it.

In February 2009, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced that he would review and possibly reduce or eliminate federal funding to the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) after its president criticized Kenney&#x27;s pro-Israel position in the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflict. Karygiannis subsequently asked the parliamentary ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, to investigate whether Kenney was abusing his position.

During his term of services in the 40th Parliament between November 2008 and December 2010, Karygiannis voted 171 times out of a possible 311 possible votes. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; ranked him third in the list of politicians that missed votes.

On February 22, 2011, Jim Karygiannis joined a protest rally of the Armenian Youth Federation by the Embassy of Azerbaijan in Ottawa timed to the anniversary of the Nagorno-Karabakh separatist movement in Azerbaijan. During his four-minute speech, he called for the Azerbaijani ambassador Farid Shafiyev to be stripped of his diplomatic privileges and leave Canada. Shafiyev reacted by saying Karygiannis had &quot;crossed the line of civility and decency and used the language of the level of street hooliganism.&quot; Later another Liberal multiculturalism critic Rob Oliphant in a telephone call to Shafiyev expressed his regret about his colleague&#x27;s statement and added that Karygiannis&#x27;s words did not represent the attitudes of the Liberal Party.

In August 2011, Citizenship and Immigration Committee officers complained of Jim Karygiannis using abusive language and an aggressive tone while speaking to them. Karygiannis stated that the accusations were false and part of a &quot;smear campaign against him.&quot;

As a multiculturalism critic, Karygiannis attempted to unite 19 cultural groups in Ottawa on August 27, 2011, to discuss issues they faced. The event was boycotted by the Jewish, Chinese, Turkish, and Macedonian communities. A spokesperson for B&#x27;nai Brith Canada said the Liberal Party should consider putting forth a better representative of the party to deal with multiculturalism matters, due to Karygiannis&#x27;s being &quot;divisive on some issues&quot;, instead of bringing communities together. The Council of Turkish Canadians released a statement where it explained its unwillingness to participate in the event by Karygiannis&#x27;s &quot;past attempts to promote ethnic division and intolerance against Canadians of different national origin&quot;, particularly Turks, Azeris and Macedonians.

In mid-August 2011, Karygiannis&#x27;s former Conservative opponent Harry Tsai, among others, signed a collective letter on behalf of the Taiwanese Canadian Association of Toronto, requesting that Bob Rae remove Karygiannis from his multicultural critic&#x27;s post. The letter cited his poor attendance of the House of Commons and bad treatment of Canada&#x27;s Turkish and Macedonian community as reasons to be considered unfit. According to Tsai, Karygiannis contacted him by telephone saying he did not care about what they had written and expressing content that the authors of the letter &quot;had been able to write in English&quot;. In his public response, Karygiannis denied making such a comment and complained that the letter was signed in part by &quot;Turks and Macedonians, who don&#x27;t like it, because I am Greek, and they have problems with Greeks.&quot; As for Tsai&#x27;s discontent, Karygiannis explained it by the Conservative candidate&#x27;s feelings after having got &quot;his butt kicked&quot; during the election.

In July 2012, Karygiannis travelled to the South Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh, on the invitation of the Armenian National Committee of Canada, to observe its presidential election. The Azerbaijani ambassador to Canada Farid Shafiyev criticized Karygiannis for taking sides in the conflict and &quot;pandering to radical elements within his constituency&quot; in chase of &quot;ethnic votes and disregarding international law.&quot; Shafiyev also claimed Karygiannis&#x27;s entry to Nagorno-Karabakh was &quot;illegal&quot;, as he had not obtained a visa or special permission from the Azerbaijani government to travel there, and that his stay on the disputed territory was paid for by the government of Armenia. In response, Karygiannis who had been aware of Azerbaijan&#x27;s objections to his visit affirmed his decision and offered to be invited to Azerbaijan as an observer for the next election, which Shafiyev turned down as unlikely, saying Karygiannis would be declared persona non grata and denied any future entry in Azerbaijan. On August 1, members of Toronto&#x27;s Azeri community held a protest in front of the office of the Liberal Party about Karygiannis&#x27;s visit to Nagorno-Karabakh.

In February 2013, Karygiannis was accused of using his political position to intervene to facilitate the passage of five Greek musicians into Canada. He was reported to have misinformed the authorities about the purpose of their visit, stating they had intended to participate in his father&#x27;s wake, when in fact they were coming to Canada to perform at a paid concert. Karygiannis did not comment other than confirming that he had intervened in the matter but &quot;did not profit from it&quot;.

=== City councillor ===
On December 1, 2014, Karygiannis joined the Toronto city council as the elected councillor for ward 39. He was re-elected in 2018 in the redistricted ward 22.

Karygiannis was appointed to the Toronto licensing and standards committee – which deals with taxi regulations. He is a vocal opponent of Uber, Karygiannis is a lifelong personal friend of Co-Op Cab company CEO Peter Zahakos. Zahakos has made donations to Karygiannis, and is a lobbyist on taxi licensing issues. An examination by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; found that Karygiannis has received at least $7600 in campaign donations in 2014 from people connected to the taxi industry, about 10% of his total fundraising, and further found that Karygiannis had received donations from 12 individuals with the same last name and address, a house owned by an official with Diamond Taxi.

In February 2016, Karygiannis brought up the possibility of banning recording artist Beyoncé from Canada. The Super Bowl 50 halftime entertainer had a routine which paid tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Black Panthers. Karygiannis went public with his interpretation of the routine as &quot;anti-policy&quot; and &quot;pro-gun culture&quot;. Karygiannis also said &quot;All lives matter.&quot;

In May 2016, Karygiannis put forward a motion to the Toronto City Council to recognize the Pontian Greek genocide. The motion said that &quot;450,000–750,000 Pontian and Anatolian Greeks were executed&quot;.

==== Removal from office ====
On November 6, 2019, Karygiannis was removed as a member of City Council for Ward 22 due to misspending on the supplementary financial statement of his 2018 election. The &quot;Municipal Elections Act&quot; permitted a maximum of 10 per cent of total funds ($6,120.80) to be spent for &quot;parties and other expressions of appreciation&quot; in Ward 22 after election day; Karygiannis exceeded this limit by $25,962.70. Karygiannis argued that the expense was an inadvertent clerical error, which represented a legitimate and legal expense that was simply miscategorized in the wrong line item.

On November 25, Justice William Chalmers of the Ontario Superior Court ruled that Karygiannis&#x27;s explanation was acceptable and that he could retake office immediately. Karygiannis returned to City Hall and resumed his work as a councillor the next day. On December 2, 2019, Toronto resident Adam Chaleff filed an appeal of the decision.

On June 24, 2020, the Court of Appeal overturned the Superior Court&#x27;s ruling stating that Karygiannis had &quot;not clearly demonstrated to this court that this was a mere &#x27;clerical error&#x27;&quot; and he was removed from office for a second time.

On August 5, 2020, a stay on the decision was granted by the Ontario Court of Appeal while Karygiannis appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, thereby reinstating him as councillor. The Supreme Court declined to give Karygiannis leave to appeal on September 24, 2020; therefore the Court of Appeal decision was upheld and he was removed from office.

==Controversies==
On February 22, 2011, Jim Karygiannis joined a protest rally of the Armenian Youth Federation by the Embassy of Azerbaijan in Ottawa timed to the anniversary of the Nagorno-Karabakh separatist movement in Azerbaijan. During his four-minute speech, he called for the Azerbaijani ambassador Farid Shafiyev to be stripped of his diplomatic privileges and leave Canada.

In July 2012, Karygiannis caused a diplomatic scandal when he travelled to the South Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh on the invitation of the Armenian National Committee of Canada, which paid for the trip. Universally recognized as an integral part of Azerbaijan, including by Canada, Nagorno-Karabakh unilaterally declared independence in 1991 followed by a violent ethnic conflict claiming over 30,000 lives on both sides, causing more than 600,000 ethnic Azeris to be displaced as a result of an ethnic cleansing and resulting in the Armenian military occupation of 16% of Azerbaijan&#x27;s territory. Karygiannis&#x27;s mission in Nagorno-Karabakh was to observe a local presidential election, though described as unconstitutional, illegitimate and counter-productive to conflict resolution by the European Union, NATO, and specifically the OSCE, which mediates the conflict. The Azerbaijani ambassador to Canada Farid Shafiyev criticized Karygiannis for taking sides in the conflict and &quot;pandering to radical elements within his constituency&quot; in chase of &quot;ethnic votes and disregarding international law.&quot; Shafiyev also pointed to Karygiannis&#x27;s illegal entry in Nagorno-Karabakh, as he had not obtained a visa or special permission from the Azerbaijani government that are required to travel there, but had instead entered through Armenia. In addition, his stay on the disputed Azerbaijani territory was paid for by the government of Armenia. In response, Karygiannis who had been aware of Azerbaijan&#x27;s objections to his visit affirmed his decision and offered to be invited to Azerbaijan as an observer for the next election, which Shafiyev turned down as unlikely, saying Karygiannis would be declared persona non grata and denied any future entry in Azerbaijan. The Canadian embassy in Ankara, also accredited to Azerbaijan, issued a statement on July 19 saying Canada would not recognize the election and that it supports Azerbaijan&#x27;s territorial integrity. On August 1, members of Toronto&#x27;s Azeri community held a protest in front of the office of the Liberal Party, defying Karygiannis&#x27;s unsanctioned visit to Nagorno-Karabakh.

In February 2013, Karygiannis was accused of using his political position to intervene to facilitate the passage of five Greek musicians into Canada. He was reported to have misinformed the authorities about the purpose of their visit, stating they had intended to participate in his father&#x27;s wake, when in fact they were coming to Canada to perform at a paid concert. Karygiannis did not comment other than confirming that he had intervened in the matter but &quot;did not profit from it&quot;.

Karygiannis went public with his interpretation of the routine as &quot;anti-policy&quot; and &quot;pro-gun culture&quot;. Karygiannis also said &quot;All lives matter.&quot;

In May 2016, Karygiannis put forward a motion to the Toronto City Council to recognize a Greek genocide. The motion claimed that &quot;450,000–750,000 Pontian and Anatolian Greeks were executed&quot;. The motion also claimed that the genocide was the first of the 20th century, which is false. The Herero and Namaqua genocide is widely considered as the first genocide of the 20th century.

==Awards==
In 1999, Greek president Costis Stephanopoulos awarded him the decoration of the Officer&#x27;s Gold Cross of the Order of Phoenix in recognition of his many public service contributions.

On December 12. 2003, he was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. This gave him the honorific title &quot;The Honourable&quot; for Life.

In 2014, Karygiannis was awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal from the Government of Armenia for his substantial input in international recognition of the Armenian Genocide.
In 2014, he received the 25 Year of Karabakh Movement Gold Medal by the Government of The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as the first Canadian to visit the Republic in 2012 to observe the Presidential Elections.

<doc id="1137223" wikidata="Q3391888" url="?curid=1137223" title="Chatham Rise">
<text>The Chatham Rise is an area of ocean floor to the east of New Zealand, forming part of the Zealandia continent. It stretches for some from near the South Island in the west, to the Chatham Islands in the east. It is New Zealand&#x27;s most productive and important fishing ground, as well as important habitat for whales.

Relative to the rest of the Pacific Ocean waters around New Zealand, the Chatham Rise is relatively shallow, no more than deep at any point. This shallowness is made more remarkable by the depth of the ocean immediately to the north and south. To the northeast, the Hikurangi Trough, an extension of the much deeper Kermadec Trench, drops to below close to the New Zealand coast, and further from the coast the Rise borders on the Hikurangi Plateau. To the south, similar depths are achieved in the Bounty Trough. Past the eastern end of the rise, the sea floor drops away to the abyssal plain.

==Geology==

Geologically and tectonically, the Chatham Rise can be thought of as an extension of the eastern South Island. It was largely dry land at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago) and formed a large peninsula extending from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands at that time.

The Cretaceous landscape of the Chatham Rise was characterized by a volcanic landscape. Fossils found on the Chatham Islands characterize the flora and fauna of the Chatham Rise in the late Mesozoic. The region had forests dominated by gymnosperms (such as &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Mataia&quot; and &quot;Podocarpus&quot;) and Lycopodiopsida (clubmosses). Some angiosperms were also present. Dinosaurs such as theropods dwelt on the peninsula and probably evolved into numerous endemic forms (Stilwell &quot;et al.&quot; 2006).

==Commercial fishing==

The Chatham Rise is New Zealand&#x27;s most productive and important commercial fishing ground. The region is analogous to the North Sea&#x27;s Broad Fourteens, but is significantly deeper.

Warm subtropical surface waters from the north and cold subantarctic surface waters from the south meet in the vicinity of the Chatham Rise to create a subtropical front. Nutrient rich waters from the south mix with warm northern waters and create ideal conditions for plankton and the animals that feed on them.

The fishing grounds near the subtropical front and particularly the Chatham Rise provide 60% of New Zealand&#x27;s fish catch. Because the Chatham Rise is relatively shallow, it is accessible to both midwater trawling and bottom trawling. Species include the main hoki, hake, ling, silver warehou, squid, orange roughy and deep sea (oreo) dory fisheries.

The traditional approach to fisheries management has been to focus on a single species – determining how many can be caught before the breeding population is affected to the point of harming the species fishery. There is a current trend towards ecosystem based fisheries. Removing any fish affects other marine life up and down the food chain, such as marine life that eat the fish, and the marine life eating the marine life that eat the fish. Scientists from NIWA are examining over 40,000 fish stomachs to see what different species are eating across the Chatham Rise. These studies, combined with other studies on marine mammals and sea birds and with relevant ocean and climate studies, will show how the different parts fit together in the Chatham Rise ecosystem.
