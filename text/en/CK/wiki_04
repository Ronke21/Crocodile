<text>Wuzhen (, Wu: Whu-tsen &quot;Wu Town&quot;) is a historic scenic town, part of Tongxiang, located in the north of Zhejiang Province, China. It was primarily built in the 7th century during the Tang dynasty.

It lies within the triangle formed by Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai. Covering an area of , Wuzhen has a total population of 60,000, of which 12,000 are permanent residents.
Wuzhen has been the permanent host place of the annual World Internet Conference, an international Internet conference held in China, since 2014.

== Location ==

Located in the centre of the six ancient towns south of the Yangtze River, north of the city of Tongxiang, Wuzhen displays its history through its ancient stone bridges, stone pathways and delicate wood carvings.

==Notable people==

* Mao Dun, a renowned modern Chinese revolutionary writer, was born in Wuzhen, and his well-known work, &#x27;The Lin&#x27;s Shop&#x27;, describes the life of Wuzhen.
* Mu Xin, a contemporary poet, calligrapher and painter, was born and died in Wuzhen. The Mu Xin Art Museum in the town is dedicated to his work.

==Town layout==
There are four divisions in Wuzhen, of which Xizha (western district) and Dongzha (eastern district) are famous tourist destinations nowadays.
Wuzhen is also divided into six districts. These are: the traditional workshops district, the traditional local-styled dwelling houses district, the traditional culture district, the traditional food and beverage district, the traditional shops and stores district, and the water township customs and life district. Following an east-west-east circuit created by these six districts, visitors can witness reenactment of traditional practices and cultures.

==Former residence of Mao Dun==
Originally built in the mid 19th century and covering a total area of , the former residence of Mao Dun, was the Mao family home for many generations. In 1984, the building was renovated and extended to cover a total area of , opening to the public one year later. In 1988, it was listed as one of the Key State Preserved Relic Units and in 1994 was renamed the Mao Dun Museum of the City of Tongxiang. The house has three exhibition areas: &#x27;Wuzhen, the Hometown of Mao Dun&#x27;, &#x27;the Way of Mao Dun&#x27;, and &#x27;the Former Residence of Mao Dun (renovated)&#x27;. The present Mao Dun Museum lies to the east of the residence, which was formerly the Lizhi Shuyuan (Aspiration Academy) where Mao Dun spent his early school years.

==Former residence of Mu Xin==
This house is located at 186 Caishenwan, Dongzha, where Muxin spent his childhood until the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1950, Muxin&#x27;s mother was obliged to donate this house to the local government, and it was later used as a standard and metric Fastener factory. In 1999, the local government renovated this house and returned it to Muxin. Muxin lived in it until he died in 2011.

==Mu Xin Art Museum==
Mu Xin Art Museum was designed by a pupil of the famous Chinese architecture designer Ieoh Ming Pei in July 2011 and has been open to the public since November 2015. Mu Xin Art Museum is located in Xizha, Wuzhen.

==Fanglu Pavilion (Pavilion of Visits to Lu)==
The Fanglu Pavilion obtained its name from an accidental meeting between Lu Tong, the owner, and Lu Yu, the Patron Saint of Tea, during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). It is said that Lu Yu once mistakenly ate some poisonous leaves and was rescued by Lu Tong, who happened to collect tea leaves at that time. In return, Lu Yu taught Lu Tong knowledge of tea and tea-making skills, which resulted in the prosperity of Lu Tong&#x27;s teahouse. At the suggestion of one guest, Lu Tong changed the establishment&#x27;s name to the &quot;Pavilion of Visits to Lu&quot;, in memory of this respected scholar. Located to the south of Ying Bridge and backing onto the city river, the teahouse enjoys a broad view of Guanqian Street.

== Bridge within a bridge ==

The &quot;Bridge within a Bridge&quot; is a scenic attraction created by two ancient bridges, the Tongji Bridge which crosses the river from east to west and the Renji Bridge running from south to north that joins the former at one end. Either of two bridges can be seen through the arch of the other, hence the name. Having been rebuilt five times, Tongji Bridge is a and one-curvature arch bridge, with a span of . Renji Bridge, which has also undergone repairs during its history, has a length of , a width of and a span of .

Demonstration in the traditional workshops district display traditional crafts as the printing and dyeing of blue printed fabrics, the primitive techniques of cloth shoe making and tobacco-planing. Visitors may operate the machines to get an idea of how the original work was carried out over 200 years ago. The local houses here are decorated with carved wooden and stone doors and windows.

<doc id="1117898" wikidata="Q5641415" url="?curid=1117898" title="Hale School">
<text>Hale School is an independent, Anglican day and boarding school for boys, located in Wembley Downs, a western suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

Named after the school founded by Bishop Mathew Blagden Hale in 1858, Hale School claims to be the oldest private boys&#x27; school in Western Australia, a claim subsequently contested by historian and former Hale School Headmaster Dr. Ken Tregonning. The school was originally situated at the Cloisters on St Georges Terrace in Perth, relocated to the Pensioner Guard Barracks at the top of St. George&#x27;s Terrace around 1880, and then again relocated to its new Havelock Street premises in 1914 in West Perth. In 1961, the school moved to its current premises in Wembley Downs. The campus now consists of a junior school for Years Pre-Primary to Year 6, a middle school for Year 7, and a senior school for Year 8 to Year 12. The school also consists of sporting grounds and boarding facilities for regional and international students.

The school is a member of the Public Schools Association and the Junior School Heads Association of Australia.

Hale&#x27;s sister school is St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Girls&#x27; School located in Karrinyup, a nearby suburb.

In 2008, Hale School celebrated its sesquicentennial (150th) anniversary.

== History ==
Part of Australia&#x27;s colonial history, Hale School educated many prominent sons of the Swan River Colony. The school was originally known as Boys High School and the inaugural chairman was Archibald Paull Burt, a notable jurist and slaveholder in the West Indies.

Modelled on England&#x27;s prestigious public schools, it has sometimes been accused of being elitist. For example, in his biography of explorer and politician Sir John Forrest, Frank Crowley described the school&#x27;s values throughout the 1870s as &quot;a heady compound of social snobbery, laissez-faire capitalism, sentimental royalism, patriotic Anglicanism, benevolent imperialism and racial superiority&quot;.

In contemporary social commentary, for example Mark Peel&#x27;s study of class and schooling in Australia, Hale School was identified as one of the most rigorous and selective schools for boys. In recent times equity concerns have been addressed by a scholarship program, including the first full boarding scholarships in Western Australia for Indigenous students.

Since at least 1930, Hale School has misrepresented its association with Bishop Hale&#x27;s School, falsely claiming for instance that it was initially known as &quot;Bishop Hale&#x27;s Collegiate School&quot;, and later as &quot;The High School&quot;. However the two were always completely separate legal entities that coexisted for 10 years - from 1876 until 1885 - under their own separate Acts of Parliament.

Bishop Hale&#x27;s private school commenced in 1858 and was known variously as &quot;Bishop’s College&quot;, &quot;Bishop Hale&#x27;s School&quot; and &quot;Bishop’s Collegiate School&quot;. In 1863 the Church of England established the &quot;Church of England Collegiate School&quot; under an Act of Parliament Ordinance 26 Vic. No. 12, of 1863. Two years later on September 7, 1865, &quot;Bishop Hale conveyed the school property to the Governors of the Church of England Collegiate School and their successors and assigns for ever—viz., Perth Building Lots H1, and H7. Bishop Hale’s School then became the Church of England Collegiate School, but was better known and spoken of as Hale’s School.&quot; 

A decade later in 1878 the taxpayer funded secular state &quot;High School&quot; opened its doors &quot;across the road&quot; from the Collegiate School. The latter could not compete when its fee paying students reenrolled at the new taxpayer sponsored &quot;High School&quot;. The secular &quot;High School&quot; effectively and immediately put &quot;Hale&#x27;s School&quot; out of business by taking away so many of its students, if not all of them, that it was no longer viable. Nevertheless &quot;Hale&#x27;s School&quot; persisted as a legal entity for another 8 years until 1885 when the Act under which the original Bishop Hale&#x27;s School had been incorporated was dissolved. 

Bishop Hale&#x27;s Collegiate School perpetually ceased to exist 26 years after Bishop Hale commenced classes in 1858 because the creation of what is today called &quot;Hale School&quot; put it out of business.

Exactly 100 years later, in 1958, persistent historical misrepresentations by former &quot;High School&quot; students were used to convince the Parliament of Western Australia into renaming &quot;High School&quot; to &quot;Hale School&quot; - in supposed honour of its purported founder - and the &quot;High School Act (1876)&quot; became the &quot;Hale School Act (1876)&quot;, converting the secular school into a religious school under the auspices Governance of the Anglican Archbishop as Visitor.

==Controversies==
According to Edith Cowan, Western Australia&#x27;s first female member of Parliament, the Act that evolved out Bishop Hale&#x27;s School – the Church of England Collegiate School Act – co-existed with a public secular school instantiated under its own Act – the High School Act, creating two independent and theologically opposed legal entities. The latter then took the name &quot;Hale School&quot;, the commencement date of 1858, and other propaganda associating itself with Bishop Hale, about which Cowan laments:

&quot;It is only those of us who remember Bishop Hale personally and his deeply spiritual and religious type of mind (yet broad and tolerant of the views of others) who can realise the travesty of giving his name to an institution whose foundations are so unmistakably opposite to the principles he invariably upheld. Can it be wondered at that the Diocesan Council takes exception, as do other members of the Church of England, to the present High or Hale School’s use of the old Bishop Hale’s School badge, to the foundation date on its new buildings and the incorrect statement that Bishop Hale founded the High School.&quot;

===Locations===
Bishop Hale&#x27;s Collegiate School occupied buildings designed by Richard Roach Jewell in 1858 and situated on St Georges Terrace. The buildings eventually became known as &quot;The Cloisters&quot;. In 1914, the school moved to a more spacious site at Havelock Street, West Perth, opposite the Parliament of Western Australia. Finally, in 1961, the school relocated to its current premises in Wembley Downs.

== Headmasters ==

== Campus ==

Hale School&#x27;s campus is a 48-hectare site located in Wembley Downs. The administration building, Memorial Hall (including the redfoot youth theatre), Tom Hoar Dining Hall, Stowe Drama Centre, Forrest Library, Chapel of St Mark, cafeteria, clothing store, IT department and Old Haleians&#x27; Boardroom are all located on the south west corner of the campus near the main entrance.

The Peter Wright Technology Building, which houses the Design and Technology Workshop as well as Computer and Design Suites sits adjacent to the Doug Poake Pool. Also adjacent to the swimming pool is the art complex, gymnasium and change-rooms.

The John Inverarity Music and Drama Centre is located on the western side of the campus facing Unwin Avenue. This building separates the Senior School from the Junior School which is located on the north west corner of the campus, along with the junior boarding residence, Brine House. The senior boarding house is located on the eastern side of the campus while the sports playing fields occupy the north east.

=== Forrest Library ===

The new Teaching and Learning precinct on the site of the old boarding houses near the south entrance to the campus was officially opened on 1 July 2009. The main feature of this project, a new Library Resource Centre includes a dedicated Year 12 study area and Gifted and Talented and Curriculum Support rooms facing a central courtyard. Beneath the library is a new clothing store, IT department and Old Haleians&#x27; Boardroom.

While the library was open for student use from February in the 2009 school year, the official opening ceremony was not held until 1 July 2009, when the facility was officially opened by Andrew Forrest and unveiled as the Forrest Library. It honours members of the Forrest family, from Sir John Forrest to Alexander Forrest, and on to Andrew Forrest himself, who had been educated at Hale.

Also included in this precinct are a new cafeteria with internal and external seating opposite the library and a new Teaching and Learning building. The classroom block (&#x27;F-block&#x27;) consists of 17 teaching spaces for History, English and languages, as well as two language oral work rooms and new office space for teaching staff. Another important feature is a set-down and pick-up road that runs from a new 50-bay carpark adjacent to the chapel, along the front of the classroom block, past the Library undercroft, before rejoining the main drive.

In 2010 the Australian Institute of Architects awarded the Forrest Library an Architecture Award for Public Architecture.

=== John Inverarity Music and Drama Centre ===
The John Inverarity Music and Drama Centre comprises a large auditorium/theatre, backstage holding rooms, two main rehearsal studios, percussion and string studios, two large music teaching rooms and 19 music practice rooms. It was first opened for use in January 2001.

The centrepiece of the complex is the timber-lined recital auditorium which accommodates 353 patrons on stepped tiers with a flat performance area 17 m wide and 12 m deep. The auditorium design has been dictated by the requirements to have natural acoustics for music. This has been achieved through the use of a traditional &#x27;rectangular box&#x27; design with a maximum ceiling height of 8 m. The auditorium can be tuned for different instruments and various music/drama performances to achieve desired acoustic qualities. This is accomplished by a system of moveable full-height wall reflectors, suspended ceiling reflectors and rotating wall panels with differing degrees of absorptive linings. The ceiling loft is mechanised with 27 variable speed automatic winch lines which give a great degree of flexibility for a range of shows.

=== Middle school ===

The construction of a new middle school facility commenced in January 2009 and was completed in January 2010. The middle school site is located adjacent to Unwin Avenue, between the John Inverarity Music and Drama Centre and the Memorial Hall. The building contains 16 classrooms for Year 7 and 8 students. The Year 8 classrooms are on the ground floor and the Year 7 classrooms are on the first floor. The main entrance, reception and administration offices for the Head of Middle School, Deputy Head, Head of Curriculum and Head of Pastoral Care are located on a separate intermediate level, which is at street level with Unwin Avenue. Other staff facilities are located on the ground floor. In addition, the facility incorporates one of the school&#x27;s existing buildings (&#x27;L-block&#x27; classrooms) which were refurbished as music, drama and science classrooms for the middle school. The ground level of this building was refurbished as a middle school science classroom (and store room), with the upper level refitted to house a drama classroom, music classroom (with store room) and four music practice rooms.

The refurbishment of this building commenced in October 2009 but was not completed in time for the commencement of the school year in February 2010. The new building replaced the &#x27;C-block&#x27; classrooms and Senior School Library that previously occupied the site and were demolished in December 2008.

=== Junior school ===
The Hale junior school was originally built when the Wembley Downs campus was opened. Today, it has classes from pre–primary up to Year 6, with around 400 students enrolled. It was demolished in 2017 to give way to an award winning new campus. Awards include &#x27;Architecture Award for Education Architecture, Western Australia 2019&#x27; and &#x27;Learning Environments WA Chapter, Category 2: New Construction / New Individual Facility over $8m&#x27;. It features a modern design with the year groups split up into a &#x27;Lower Junior&#x27; (PP to Year 2), &#x27;Middle Junior&#x27; (Year 3 and Year 4) and &#x27;Upper Junior&#x27; (Year 5 and Year 6). All buildings have open areas, called &#x27;breakout spaces&#x27;, where students can work together in small groups or presentations can be held.

Hale School has hosted important teams over the years, including the English rugby team on occasions, namely for training during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The school hosted the English Cricket Academy, including international cricketers Michael Vaughan, Owais Shah, Stuart Broad, Rikki Clarke and Jon Lewis for nets sessions and practice matches, as seen on the front page of &quot;The West Australian&quot; on 29 November 2006.

<text>The pan-Arab colors are black, white, green and red. Individually, each of the four pan-Arab colors were intended to represent a certain aspect of the Arab people and their history.

==History==

The four colors derive their potency from a verse by 14th century Arab poet Safi al-Din al-Hilli: &quot;White are our acts, black our battles, green our fields, and red our swords.&quot;. The black is the Black Standard, which was used by the Rashidun and Abbasid Caliphate, while white was the dynastic color of the Umayyad Caliphate. Green is a color associated with Islam, the primary religion of Arabs. Green is also identified as the color of the Fatimid Caliphate by some modern sources, despite their dynastic color having been white. Finally, red was used as the Hashemite dynastic color.

Pan-Arab colors, used individually in the past, were first combined in 1916 in the flag of the Arab Revolt or Flag of Hejaz. Many current flags are based on Arab Revolt colors, such as the flags of Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and the United Arab Emirates.

In the 1950s, a subset of the Pan-Arab colors, the Arab Liberation colors, came to prominence. These consist of a tricolor of red, white and black bands, with green given less prominence or not included. The &quot;Arab Liberation tricolor&quot; or the &quot;Arab Liberation Flag&quot; was mainly inspired by the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and Egypt&#x27;s official flag under president Mohamed Naguib, which became the basis of the current flags of Egypt, Iraq, Sudan,and Yemen (and formerly in the flags of Syria, the states of North Yemen and South Yemen), and in the short-lived Arab unions of the United Arab Republic and the Federation of Arab Republics.

<text>John Hancock Life Insurance Company, U.S.A. is a Boston-based insurance company. Established April 21, 1862, it was named in honor of John Hancock, a prominent American Patriot.

In 2004, Canadian multinational life insurance company Manulife Financial acquired John Hancock and operates it as an independent subsidiary. The company and the majority of Manulife&#x27;s U.S. assets continue to operate under the John Hancock name.

==History==

On April 21, 1862, the charter of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company was approved by John A. Andrew, governor of Massachusetts.

There was not always a standardization for how the company name has been referenced. For example, a John Hancock advertisement from 1912 refers to the company as &quot;John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company,&quot; but some John Hancock advertisements and newspaper articles from the 1930s refer to it as the &quot;John Hancock Life Insurance Company.&quot; However, 1940s sources again refer to the company as the &quot;John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.&quot;

In 1964, the company financed the construction of the John Hancock Center (now known as 875 Michigan Avenue) in Chicago, which was the second tallest building in the world upon completion in 1969. The company sold the naming rights in 2018.

In 1972, Dr. Mary Ella Robertson was named as the first black woman and first female to serve on the John Hancock Board.

In 2000, led by David D&#x27;Alessandro, the company &quot;demutualized,&quot; meaning that &quot;John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company&quot; formally ceased to exist, and a new company named &quot;John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.&quot; came into existence. Policyholders received shares in the new company in exchange for giving up ownership in the old. Life insurance continued to be sold by an entity known as the &quot;John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company&quot;, a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services Inc. On January 27, 2000, shares of Hancock stock started to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JHF.

On September 29, 2003, Manulife Financial of Canada announced its intent to acquire John Hancock for $10.4 billion. The merged entity would be led by D&#x27;Alessandro, but he would step down in June 2004. The sale also included a Canadian subsidiary of John Hancock, Maritime Life; it was integrated into Manulife&#x27;s Canadian operations.

==Headquarters==
The headquarters and its 1,100 employees are based in 200 Berkeley Street, sometimes known as the &quot;Old John Hancock Building&quot; and 197 Clarendon Street. John Hancock no longer has a presence in the Back Bay tower at 200 Clarendon Street, still known by many Bostonians as the Hancock Tower. The company was headquartered at 601 Congress Street in the Seaport District from 2005 to 2018, when it consolidated with offices it had retained in the Back Bay.

==Investor Sentiment Index==
John Hancock created an index called the &quot;John Hancock Investor Sentiment Index&quot; in 2011. The company describes the index as a &quot;quarterly measure of investors&#x27; views on a range of investment choices, life goals and economic outlook.&quot;

==Leadership==
In October 2017, Marianne Harrison became the first female president and chief executive officer of John Hancock. She earned a reported $4.4 million in compensation in 2017.

On March 3, 2023, Brooks Tingle was named the new President and CEO, effective April 1, 2023, with Marianne Harrison retiring after 20 years with the company. Mr. Tingle announced his leadership plans for the company to enhance human longevity and health in Boston as a longevity hub.

<doc id="1117907" wikidata="Q878035" url="?curid=1117907" title="Epenthesis">
<text>In phonology, epenthesis (; Greek ) means the addition of one or more sounds to a word, especially in the first syllable (&quot;prothesis&quot;), the last syllable (&quot;paragoge&quot;), or between two syllabic sounds in a word. The opposite process in which one or more sounds are removed is referred to as elision.
==Etymology==
The word &quot;epenthesis&quot; comes from and &quot;en-&quot; and &quot;thesis&quot; . Epenthesis may be divided into two types: excrescence for the addition of a consonant, and for the addition of a vowel, svarabhakti (in Sanskrit) or alternatively anaptyxis ().

==Uses==
Epenthesis arises for a variety of reasons. The phonotactics of a given language may discourage vowels in hiatus or consonant clusters, and a consonant or vowel may be added to help pronunciation. Epenthesis may be represented in writing, or it may be a feature only of the spoken language.

===Separating vowels===
A consonant may be added to separate vowels in hiatus, as is the case with linking and intrusive R in English.

* &quot;drawing&quot; → &quot;draw-r-ing&quot;

===Bridging consonant clusters===
A consonant may be placed between consonants in a consonant cluster where the place of articulation is different (such as if one consonant is labial and the other is alveolar).

* &quot;something&quot; → &quot;somepthing&quot;
*&quot;hamster&quot; → &quot;hampster&quot;
* &quot;*a-mrotos&quot; → &quot;ambrotos&quot; (see below)

===Breaking consonant clusters===
A vowel may be placed between consonants to separate them.

*&quot;Hamtramck&quot; → &quot;Hamtramick&quot;

===Other contexts===
While epenthesis most often occurs between two vowels or two consonants, it can also occur between a vowel and a consonant or at the ends of words. For example, the Japanese prefix transforms regularly to when it is followed by a consonant, as in . The English suffix , often found in the form , as in (from + ), is an example of terminal excrescence.

==Excrescence==
Excrescence is the epenthesis of a consonant.

===Historical sound change===
* Latin &gt; French ()
* Old English &gt; English &quot;thunder&quot;
* French , &gt; English &quot;messenger&quot;, &quot;passenger&quot;
* French , &gt; Portuguese , 
* (Reconstructed) Proto-Germanic &gt; Old English , Old Saxon ()
* (Reconstructed) Proto-Greek &gt; Ancient Greek (; cf. &quot;ambrosia&quot;)
* Latin &gt; &quot;homne&quot; &gt; &quot;homre&quot; &gt; Spanish ()
* Latin &gt; &quot;ouir&quot; &gt; Portuguese ()

===Synchronic rule===
In French, is inserted in inverted interrogative phrases between a verb ending in a vowel and a pronoun beginning with a vowel: (&#x27;he has&#x27;) &gt; (&#x27;has he?&#x27;). There is no epenthesis from a historical perspective since the is derived from Latin (&#x27;he has&#x27;), and so the is the original third-person verb inflection. It is incorrect to call it epenthesis unless it is viewed synchronically since the modern basic form of the verb is and so the psycholinguistic process is the addition of to the base form.

A similar example is the English indefinite article &quot;a&quot;, which becomes &quot;an&quot; before a vowel. It originated from Old English (), which retained an &quot;n&quot; in all positions, so a diachronic analysis would see the original &quot;n&quot; disappearing except if a following vowel required its retention: &quot;an&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot;. However, a synchronic analysis, in keeping with the perception of most native speakers, would (though incorrectly) see it as epenthesis: &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;an&quot;.

In Dutch, whenever the suffix (which has several meanings) is attached to a word already ending in &quot;-r&quot;, an additional is inserted in between. For example, the comparative form of the adjective () is , but the comparative of () is and not the expected **. Similarly, the agent noun of () is (), but the agent noun of () is ().

===Variable rule===

In English, a stop consonant is often added as a transitional sound between the parts of a nasal + fricative sequence:

* English &quot;hamster&quot; often pronounced with an added &quot;p&quot; sound, GA: or RP: 
* English &quot;warmth&quot; often pronounced with an added &quot;p&quot; sound, GA: or RP: 
* English &quot;fence&quot; often pronounced 

===Poetic device===
* Latin (accusative plural) &gt; poetic 

The three short syllables in do not fit into dactylic hexameter because of the dactyl&#x27;s limit of two short syllables so the first syllable is lengthened by adding another &quot;l&quot;. However, the pronunciation was often not written with double &quot;ll&quot;, and may have been the normal way of pronouncing a word starting in &quot;rel-&quot; rather than a poetic modification.

===In Japanese===
A limited number of words in Japanese use epenthetic consonants to separate vowels. An example is the word , a compound of and in which an is added to separate the final of &#x27; and the initial of &#x27;. That is a &quot;synchronic&quot; analysis. As for a diachronic (historical) analysis, since epenthetic consonants are not used regularly in modern Japanese, the epenthetic could be from Old Japanese. It is also possible that Old Japanese /ame2/ was once pronounced */same2/; the would then be not epenthetic but simply an archaic pronunciation. Another example is .

A complex example of epenthesis is , from + . It exhibits epenthesis on both morphemes: → is common (occurring before a consonant), and → occurs only in the example; it can be analyzed as → (intervocalic) → ; akin to from + .

One hypothesis argues that Japanese developed &quot;as a default, epenthetic consonant in the intervocalic position&quot;.
==Anaptyxis ==
Epenthesis of a vowel is known as anaptyxis (, from Greek ). Some accounts distinguish between &quot;intrusive&quot; optional vowels, vowel-like releases of consonants as phonetic detail, and true epenthetic vowels that are required by the phonotactics of the language and are acoustically identical with phonemic vowels.

===Historical sound change===
====End of word====
Many languages insert a so-called &quot;prop vowel&quot; at the end of a word, often as a result of the common sound change where vowels at the end of a word are deleted. For example, in the Gallo-Romance languages, a prop schwa was added when final non-open vowels were dropped leaving /Cr/ clusters at the end, e.g. Latin &#x27;(shiny) black&#x27; &gt; * &gt; Old French &#x27;black&#x27; (thus avoiding the impermissible , cf. &gt; &#x27;cart&#x27;).

====Middle of word====
Similarly as above, a vowel may be inserted in the middle of a word to resolve an impermissible word-final consonant cluster. An example of this can be found in Lebanese Arabic, where &#x27;heart&#x27; corresponds to Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic . In the development of Old English, Proto-Germanic &#x27;field, acre&#x27; would have ended up with an impermissible final cluster (), so it was resolved by inserting an before the rhotic consonant: (cf. the use of a syllabic consonant in Gothic ).

Vowel insertion in the middle of a word can be observed in the history of the Slavic languages, which had a preference for open syllables in medieval times. An example of this is the Proto-Slavic form &#x27;town&#x27;, in which the East Slavic languages inserted an epenthetic copy vowel to open the closed syllable, resulting in (), which became () in modern Russian and Ukrainian. Other Slavic languages used metathesis for the vowel and the syllable-final consonant, producing *&quot;grodŭ&quot; in this case, as seen in Polish , Old Church Slavonic , Serbo-Croatian and Czech .

Another environment can be observed in the history of Modern Persian, in which former word-initial consonant clusters, which were still extant in Middle Persian, are regularly broken up: Middle Persian &#x27;brother&#x27; &gt; modern Iranian Persian , Middle Persian &#x27;column&#x27; &gt; Early New Persian &gt; modern Iranian Persian .

In Spanish, as a phonetic detail, it is usual to find a schwa vowel in sequences of a consonant followed by a flap. For instance, &#x27;vinegar&#x27; may be but also . 

Many Indo-Aryan languages carry an inherent vowel after each consonant. For example, in Assamese, the inherent vowel is &quot;o&quot; (), while in Hindi and Marathi, it is &quot;a&quot; (). Sanskrit words like (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ) etc. become ( &gt; ), ( &gt; ), ( &gt; ), ( &gt; ), ( &gt; ), ( &gt; ) etc. in Assamese. Other, non-Tatsama words also undergo anaptyxis, for example, the English word &quot;glass&quot; becomes ().

====Beginning of word====
In the Western Romance languages, a prothetic vowel was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with and another consonant, e.g. Latin &#x27;two-edged sword, typically used by cavalry&#x27; becomes the normal word for &#x27;sword&#x27; in Romance languages with an inserted : Spanish/Portuguese , Catalan , Old French &gt; modern (see also &#x27;swordfish&#x27;).

French in fact presents three layers in the vocabulary in which initial vowel epenthesis is or is not applied, depending on the time a word came into the language:

* insertion of epenthetic in inherited and commonly-used learned and semi-learned words, which then drop the following after the medieval period: Latin &gt; Old French &gt; modern &#x27;star&#x27;, &gt; Old French &gt; modern &#x27;study&#x27;, &gt; OF &gt; modern &#x27;school&#x27;
* insertion of and keeping in learned words borrowed during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance: &gt; , &gt; 
* then in the modern period, is not inserted and uncommon old learned borrowings are remolded to look more like Latin: &gt; , &gt; , &gt; learned Old French &gt; remolded to modern 

Similarly, at some point in the Proto-Armenian language and Classical Armenian, the prothetic vowel was placed at the beginning of the word before the sound , leading to words like (, ) from Iranian (), or (, ) from Iranian ().

===Grammatical rule===
Epenthesis often breaks up a consonant cluster or vowel sequence that is not permitted by the phonotactics of a language. Regular or semi-regular epenthesis commonly occurs in languages with affixes. For example, a reduced vowel or (here abbreviated as ) is inserted before the English plural suffix and the past tense suffix when the root ends in a similar consonant: &quot;glass&quot; → &quot;glasses&quot; or ; &quot;bat&quot; → &quot;batted&quot; . However, this is a synchronic analysis as the vowel was originally present in the suffix but has been lost in most words.

===Borrowed words===
Vocalic epenthesis typically occurs when words are borrowed from a language that has consonant clusters or syllable codas that are not permitted in the borrowing language.

Languages use various vowels, but schwa is quite common when it is available:

* Hebrew uses a single vowel, the schwa (pronounced in Israeli Hebrew).
* Japanese generally uses except after and , when it uses , and after , when it uses an echo vowel. For example, English &quot;cap&quot; becomes in Japanese; English &quot;street&quot;, ; the Dutch name , ; and the German name , .
* Korean uses in most cases. is used after borrowed , , , , or , although may also be used after borrowed depending on the source language. is used when is followed by a consonant or when a syllable ends with . For example, English &quot;strike&quot; becomes , with three epenthetic vowels and a split of English diphthong into two syllables.
* Brazilian Portuguese uses , which, in most dialects, triggers palatalization of a preceding or : &quot;nerd&quot; &gt; ; &quot;stress&quot; &gt; ; &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; &gt; with normal vocalization of to . Most speakers pronounce borrowings with spelling pronunciations, and others try to approximate the nearest equivalents in Portuguese of the phonemes in the original language. The word &quot;stress&quot; became &quot;estresse&quot; as in the example above.
* Classical Arabic does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word, and typically uses to break up such clusters in borrowings: Latin &gt; &#x27;street&#x27;. In Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic, copy vowels are often used as well, e.g. English/French &quot;klaxon&quot; (car horn) &gt; Egyptian Arabic &#x27;car horn&#x27;, but note French &gt; Egyptian Arabic (where corresponds to Modern Standard Arabic ). Many other modern varieties such as North Levantine Arabic and Moroccan Arabic allow word-initial clusters, however.
*Persian also does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word and typically uses to break up such clusters in borrowings except between and , when is added.
* Spanish does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word with an in them and adds &quot;e-&quot; to such words: Latin &gt; , English &quot;stress&quot; &gt; .
* Turkish prefixes close vowels to loanwords with initial clusters of alveolar fricatives followed by another consonant: &lt; Greek (), &lt; &quot;set screw&quot;, &lt; Greek (), &lt; Byzantine Greek (), &lt; &quot;steamboat&quot;, &lt; &quot;Scotland&quot;, &lt; Greek (), &lt; Greek (). The practice is no longer productive as of late 20th century and a few such words have changed back: &lt; &lt; French .

===Informal speech===
Epenthesis most often occurs within unfamiliar or complex consonant clusters. For example, in English, the name &quot;Dwight&quot; is commonly pronounced with an epenthetic schwa between the and the (), and many speakers insert a schwa between the and of &quot;realtor&quot;. Irish English and Scottish English are some of the dialects that may insert a schwa between and in words like &quot;film&quot; () under the influence of Celtic languages, a phenomenon that also occurs in Indian English due to the influence of Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi.

Epenthesis is sometimes used for humorous or childlike effect. For example, the cartoon character Yogi Bear says &quot;pic-a-nic basket&quot; for &quot;picnic basket&quot;. Another example is found in the chants of England football fans in which England is usually rendered as or the pronunciation of &quot;athlete&quot; as &quot;ath-e-lete&quot;. Some apparent occurrences of epenthesis, however, have a separate cause: the pronunciation of &quot;nuclear&quot; as &quot;&quot; () in some North American dialects arises out of analogy with other -&quot;cular&quot; words (&quot;binocular&quot;, &quot;particular&quot;, etc.) rather than from epenthesis.

In colloquial registers of Brazilian Portuguese, is sometimes inserted between consonant clusters except those with (), () or syllable-ending (; note syllable-final is pronounced in a number of dialects). Examples would be , and . Some dialects also use , which is deemed as stereotypical of people from lower classes, such as those arriving from rural flight in internal migrations to cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Brasília and São Paulo.

===In Finnish===
In Finnish, there are two epenthetic vowels and two nativization vowels. One epenthetic vowel is the preceding vowel, found in the illative case ending : → , → . The second is , connecting stems that have historically been consonant stems to their case endings: → .

In Standard Finnish, consonant clusters may not be broken by epenthetic vowels; foreign words undergo consonant deletion rather than addition of vowels: () from Proto-Germanic . However, modern loans may not end in consonants. Even if the word, such as a personal name, is native, a paragogic vowel is needed to connect a consonantal case ending to the word. The vowel is : → , or in the case of personal name, + → (elative case).

Finnish has moraic consonants: , and are of interest. In Standard Finnish, they are slightly intensified before a consonant in a medial cluster: . Some dialects, like Savo and Ostrobothnian, have epenthesis instead and use the preceding vowel in clusters of type and , in Savo also . (In Finnish linguistics, the phenomenon is often referred to as ; the same word can also mean , but it is not a phoneme in Finnish so there is usually no danger of confusion.)

For example, → , → , and Savo → . Ambiguities may result: vs. . (An exception is that in Pohjanmaa, and become and , respectively: → . Also, in a small region in Savo, is used instead.)

===In constructed languages===
Lojban, a constructed language that seeks logically-oriented grammatical and phonological structures, uses a number of consonant clusters in its words. Since it is designed to be as universal as possible, it allows a type of anaptyxis called &quot;buffering&quot; to be used if a speaker finds a cluster difficult or impossible to pronounce. A vowel sound that is nonexistent in Lojban (usually /ɪ/ as in ) is added between two consonants to make the word easier to pronounce. Despite altering the phonetics of a word, the use of buffering is completely ignored by grammar. Also, the vowel sound used must not be confused with any existing Lojban vowel.

An example of buffering in Lojban is that if a speaker finds the cluster in the word () (pronounced ) hard or impossible to pronounce, the vowel can be pronounced between the two consonants, resulting in the form . Nothing changes grammatically, including the word&#x27;s spelling and the syllabication.

==In sign language==
A type of epenthesis in sign language is known as &quot;movement epenthesis&quot; and occurs, most commonly, during the boundary between signs while the hands move from the posture required by the first sign to that required by the next.

==Related phenomena==
* Infixation: the insertion of a morpheme within a word
* Metathesis: the reordering of sounds within a word
* Paragoge: the addition of a sound to the end of a word
* Prothesis: the addition of a sound to the beginning of a word
* Tmesis: the inclusion of a whole word within another one

<text>Ernest James Renshaw (3 January 1861 – 2 September 1899) was a British tennis player who was active in the late 19th century.

Together with his twin brother William Renshaw, Ernest won the men&#x27;s doubles at Wimbledon five times. He also won the singles championship at Wimbledon once, in 1888 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983. He won the singles title at the Irish Championships on four occasions (1883, 1887, 1888, 1892). Ernest was the older of the brothers by 15 minutes and half an inch taller.

The boom in popularity of the game during the 1880s due to the modern tennis style of the Renshaw brothers became known as the &#x27;Renshaw Rush&#x27;.

==Death==
He died of the effects of carbolic acid, but evidence could not prove whether it had been taken intentionally or not.

In 1983, Ernest Renshaw was elected posthumously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame together with his brother. In 2020, a street in Leamington Spa was named after his brother and him, Renshaw Drive.

<text>Ladislas Joseph Meduna (27 March 1896 – 31 October 1964) was a Hungarian neuropathologist and neuropsychiatrist who initiated convulsive treatment, the repeated induction of grand mal seizures, as a treatment of psychosis. Observing the high concentration of glia in post-mortem brains of patients with epilepsy and a paucity in those with schizophrenia, he proposed that schizophrenia might be treated by inducing &quot;epileptic&quot; seizures. Thus, chemically induced seizures became the electroconvulsive therapy that is now in worldwide use.

With the rise of Nazism in Europe, he emigrated to Chicago in 1939. In studies with American scientists, Meduna explored carbon dioxide therapy for depression and anxiety and described oneirophrenia as a treatable psychiatric illness.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Meduna was born to a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary, in 1896. His grandfather Giuseppe Carlo (József), a descendant of the Meduna family, came from Castelcucco, Italy, to Hungary, where he became a successful and awarded salami maker. Multiple members of the family branch, including Ladislas Meduna during his military service in World War I, oftentimes used the name &quot;Meduna di Montecucco&quot; or alternatively the noble title &quot;von&quot; in their name.

Meduna studied medicine in Budapest from 1914 to 1921, his studies being interrupted by military service in the Italian front from 1915 to 1918.

===Early career===
He was appointed to the Hungarian Interacademic Institute for Brain Research, also in Budapest, where he worked under the direction of Károly Schaffer. He studied the neuropathology of the structure and development of the pineal gland and of microglia, lead poisoning, and avitaminosis. In 1927 he moved to the Psychiatric Institute with Dr. Schaffer and began clinical and research work in psychopathology.

===Induction of seizures===
Meduna&#x27;s interest in treating schizophrenia began with observations that the concentration of brain glia varied among patients who died with epilepsy (more glia than normal) and those with schizophrenia (less glia than normal). He thought that the inductions of seizures in patients with schizophrenia would increase the concentration of glia and relieve the illness. The concept was supported by reports that the incidence of epilepsy in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia was extremely low; and that a few schizophrenic patients who developed seizures after infection or head trauma, were relieved of their psychosis.

He sought ways to induce seizures in animals with chemicals. After trials with the alkaloids strychnine, thebaine, coramine, caffeine, and brucin, he settled on camphor dissolved in oil as effective and reliable. For a population with severe schizophrenia, he moved from Budapest to the psychiatric hospital at Lipotmező, outside Budapest. He began his dose-finding experiments on January 2, 1934. He was able to induce seizures in only about one-third of his subjects. Nevertheless, three of the first eleven patients had a positive response, encouraging his work (see Gazdag et al., 2009). In his autobiography, he recalls the case of a 33-year-old patient with severe catatonia who began his treatment on January 23, 1934. After just five sessions, catatonia and psychotic symptoms were abolished. Increasing his sample size to twenty-six patients, Meduna achieved recovery in ten and improvement in three more.

A major factor in Meduna&#x27;s achievement was his selection of patients: nine of the first eleven were catatonic. Catatonia is a syndrome that is remarkably responsive to induced seizures. The serendipity that catatonia was considered schizophrenia at the time made his discovery possible.

Early on, Meduna replaced camphor with pentylenetetrazol, an intravenous agent that typically induced seizures within a few minutes, compared with the long delay of 15 to 45 minutes after intramuscular administration of camphor. In addition to being a powerful analeptic drug, pentylenetetrazol is a potent cardiac and respiratory stimulant; consequently, patients experienced sensations most considered unpleasant. They were completely alert until unconsciousness from the convulsion set in, and unlike with electroconvulsive therapy, which caused retrograde amnesia that ameliorated any unpleasant memory of that treatment, patients remembered any sensations that preceded the Metrazol-induced convulsion. Meduna and some other physicians felt that the fear reaction may have been part of the reason the treatment was successful in some patients.

===Published research===
He first published his results in 1935 and then his major text in 1937. &quot;Die Konvulsionstherapie der Schizophrenie&quot; describes the results in 110 patients. Of these patients about half recovered. The results were much better for patients who were ill less than a year compared to those who had been ill for many years.

After his results were quickly reproduced in many other centers around the world, this form of therapy became widely used and recognized as the first effective treatment for schizophrenia.(A parallel development was insulin coma therapy.) A more facile form of induction of seizures, using electricity instead of chemicals, was developed by the Italian psychiatrists Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini. They treated their first patient with ECT in April 1938 and by the mid-1940s, electricity had replaced Metrazole as the induction agent.

===Carbon dioxide therapy===
Meduna also developed carbon dioxide therapy in which the patient breathed a gaseous mixture of 30% carbon dioxide and 70% oxygen called &quot;carboxygen&quot; or &quot;carbogen&quot; (and sometimes &quot;Meduna&#x27;s Mixture&quot;) that was designed to provoke a powerful feeling of suffocation, quickly triggering an unresponsive yet intense altered mental state. The treatment, while usually unpleasant or even terrifying, proved very useful for revealing previously unconscious fears. Challenging experiences on carbogen prepared patients for later psychedelic therapy in a profound way. It was not as effective as convulsive therapy in relieving the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and was therefore abandoned.

===Migration to the United States===
With the increase of antisemitism and the rise to power of Nazism, Meduna emigrated to the United States in the following year (1938), to become professor of neurology at Loyola University in Chicago. One of his last contributions to psychiatry was the study of confusional and dream-like states in psychoses (oneirophrenia) He was also a founder of the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and a President of the Society of Biological Psychiatry. After the war, he moved his research to the Illinois Psychiatric Institute, where he worked until his death in 1964.

<text>The second USS &quot;Foote&quot; (DD–169) was a in the United States Navy following World War I. She was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Roxborough&quot; (I07) and later to the Soviet Navy as Zhyostky (or &quot;Doblestny &quot;; sources vary).

==Service history==
===As USS &quot;Foote&quot;===
Named for Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, she was launched 14 December 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Lelia F. Cady, daughter of Admiral Foote; and commissioned 21 March 1919.

&quot;Foote&quot; sailed from Boston 3 May 1919 to take up an observation station off Newfoundland for the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic, made later that month by Navy seaplanes. She returned to Boston 22 May to complete her interrupted fitting out, then took part in training operations until sailing from Newport 27 August bound for a tour of duty with Naval Forces European Waters. From September through December, she served in the Adriatic, and then called at Italian and French ports homeward bound. Arriving at Boston 12 February 1920, she was placed in reserve 24 February for repairs there and at Charleston.

In the summer of 1921, &quot;Foote&quot; operated with 50 percent of her complement during summer target practice in Narragansett Bay, and returning to Charleston, she lay there and at Boston for alterations and repairs until decommissioned at Philadelphia 6 July 1922. Recommissioned 2 July 1940, &quot;Foote&quot; operated on patrol out of Charleston, until sailing 7 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, on 23 September 1940, she was decommissioned and transferred to the Royal Navy in the destroyers for land bases exchange.

===As HMS &quot;Roxborough&quot;===

Commissioned as HMS &quot;Roxborough&quot; 23 September 1940, the destroyer crossed the Atlantic to join the Western Approaches Command, guarding convoys during the dangerous last leg of their voyages into British ports. In March 1942, &quot;Roxborough&quot; took up western Atlantic escort duty out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. &quot;Roxborough&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original /50 guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar.

While with convoy HX222 &quot;Roxborough&quot; met with such heavy weather that the entire bridge structure was crushed, with eleven dead, including the Commanding Officer and 1st Lieutenant. The sole surviving executive officer managed to regain control of the ship, and under hand steering from aft, she made St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

Returning to the Tyne 10 January 1944, &quot;Roxborough&quot; lay in reserve there until transferred to the Soviet Navy on 1 August 1944.

===In Soviet service ===

On 1 August 1944 &quot;Roxborough&quot; was transferred to the Soviet Navy. She was renamed (sources vary) either &quot;Zhyostky&quot; (rus. &quot;Rigid&quot;) or &quot;Doblestny &quot; (rus. &quot;Glorious or Valiant&quot;). She was returned to Great Britain 7 February 1949 and was scrapped on 14 May 1949.

<text>Sybil Fenton Newall (17 October 1854 – 24 June 1929), best known as Queenie Newall, was an English archer who won the gold medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. She was 53 years old at the time, still the oldest female gold medal winner at the Olympic Games. Great Britain did not win another women&#x27;s archery medal at the Olympics until 2004. She joined the Cheltenham Archers Club in 1905 and was national champion twice in 1911 and 1912.

==Biography==
Sybil &quot;Queenie&quot; Fenton Newall was born in Hare Hill House, Littleborough, Rochdale (part of her father&#x27;s estate) on 17 October 1854. In 1905, along with her sister Margaret, she joined the local Cheltenham archery club. By 1907, she had won four of the five regional meetings.

She took part at the 1908 Summer Olympics, held in White City, London. The expected winner of the women&#x27;s archery, Alice Legh, chose not to compete, and so Queenie&#x27;s main rival was Lottie Dod who was a sporting all-rounder. The entire field competing in the women&#x27;s archery was British.

On the first day of the Archery competition, the weather in White City Stadium was so poor that the event was stopped at one point. On the close of the first day, Queenie was behind Dod by ten points. The second day&#x27;s weather was much improved, and Queenie overtook Dod, eventually winning with a score of 688 points, 46 points ahead of Dod, who finished in the silver medal position. The victory made Queenie the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal, at the age of 53 years and 275 days, a record which still stands as of 2012.

At the following National Championships, Newell was defeated by Alice Legh, but she went on to win it in 1911, retained it in 1912, and won it once more in 1914. She continued in the sport following the First World War, her last score was recorded by the Cheltenham archery club in 1928. She died at her home in Cheltenham on 24 June 1929.

After the 1908 Olympics, no female British archer won an Olympic medal until Alison Williamson won the bronze in the women&#x27;s individual competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
Queenie was the eldest daughter of the ten children of Henry Newall and Maria Fenton. Her father was a merchant and owned Hare Hill House and estate in Littleborough, Lancashire. Her grandfather John Fenton was the Member of Parliament for Rochdale following the 1832 and 1837 general elections. Queenie never married and instead lived with her sister Margaret in Cheltenham all her life.

<text>Sir Douglas Arthur Montrose Graham (born 12 January 1942) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party.

==Early life and family==
Graham was born in Auckland, and attended Southwell School and Auckland Grammar School. In 1965 he obtained an LLB from the University of Auckland and became a lawyer, establishing his own practice in 1968. From 1973 to 1983, he lectured in legal ethics at the University of Auckland. He was chairman of the board of the Auckland Regional Orchestra from 1982 to 1983.

His great-grandfather Robert Graham was a member of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th New Zealand parliaments, from 1855 to 1868. In 2008, his brother Kennedy Graham was elected to parliament representing the Green Party. His son, Carrick, is a public relations consultant.

==Member of Parliament==



In the lead up to the 1981 election Graham unsuccessfully challenged Allan Highet for the National nomination for the suburban Auckland electorate of Remuera. Three years later Highet retired and Graham was elected to Parliament in the 1984 election as his replacement. After entering parliament National leader Sir Robert Muldoon designated Graham spokesperson for the Arts, Insurance and EQC. When Muldoon was replaced by his deputy Jim McLay Graham was appointed Shadow Minister for Disarmament and was later allocated the Revenue portfolio as well. He initially retained those roles after McLay was ousted by Jim Bolger, but substituted the Revenue portfolio for Broadcasting in September 1987 but in a major reshuffle in February 1990 he changed back from Broadcasting to Revenue and was also appointed Shadow Minister for Constitutional Issues.

===Cabinet minister===

When the National Party won the 1990 election, Graham was appointed to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Justice, Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, and Minister of Cultural Affairs. In 1993, he became Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, perhaps his most prominent role. He was widely praised by both Pākehā and Māori for his work on numerous Treaty settlements, although opponents of the process have voiced criticisms of his policies. Later, Graham also became Attorney-General and Minister for Courts. In the 1996 election, when the Remuera seat was abolished, Graham became a list MP. He was ranked sixth on National&#x27;s party list, a relatively high placing.

On 21 May 1998 Graham was appointed to the Privy Council and became the Right Honourable Douglas Graham.

==Life after politics==
He retired from politics at the 1999 election. In the 1999 New Year Honours, Graham was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Minister of the Crown and Member of Parliament.

On 24 February 2012 he was convicted, along with fellow former Justice Minister Bill Jeffries and two other men, of breaching the Securities Act by making untrue statements to investors in his capacity as a director of Lombard Finance. Justice Robert Dobson wrote, &quot;I am satisfied that the accused genuinely believed in the accuracy and adequacy of the ... documents&quot;, but that the offences were ones of strict liability so there was no need for &quot;any form of mental intent to distribute documents that were false or misleading&quot;. Graham was sentenced to 300 hours&#x27; community service and ordered to pay $100,000 in reparation. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against conviction and increased his sentence to six months&#x27; home detention and 200 hours&#x27; community work, but the Supreme Court restored the original sentence. Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Edmund Thomas described the convictions as a &quot;grievous miscarriage of justice&quot;, saying of the crucial piece of evidence that &quot;you would never ever convict a dog on the basis of the schedule&quot;. There have been calls for his knighthood to be revoked, but Prime Minister John Key announced on 1 November 2013 that Graham would keep his knighthood.

<doc id="1117931" wikidata="Q647714" url="?curid=1117931" title="Cresta Run">
<text>The Cresta Run is a natural ice track in eastern-Switzerland used for skeleton-toboggan racing. Located in the winter sports town of St. Moritz, the run is one of the few in the world dedicated entirely to skeleton. It was built in 1884 near the hamlet of Cresta in the municipality of Celerina/Schlarigna by the Outdoor Amusement Committee of the Kulm Hotel and the people of St. Moritz. It has continued as a partnership to this day between the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC), founded in 1887, and the people of St. Moritz.

The sport of intramural sled racing originated in winter resort activities at the Kulm Hotel St. Moritz during the early 1870s. SMTC members still congregate for lunch in the &#x27;Sunny Bar&#x27; at the Kulm. In the early days of competitive sledding, the predominant style was luge-style racing, lying on one&#x27;s back, but the invention of the flexible runner sled (Flexible Flyer) in 1887, known colloquially as &#x27;the America&#x27;, led to one Mr. Cornish using the head-first style in the 1887 Grand National. He finished fourteenth due to some erratic rides but established a trend, and by the 1890 Grand National all competitors were riding head-first. The head-first style for a time became known as &#x27;Cresta&#x27; racing.

==The sport and its history==

The Cresta Run and the SMTC were founded by devotees of sledding (tobogganing in English) who adopted a head-first (prone) technique of racing down an icy run, as opposed to the feet-first (supine) and somewhat faster luge race. Both evolving sports were natural extensions of the invention of steerable sleds during the early 1870s by British guests of the Kulm hotel in St. Moritz. The initial crude sleds were developed almost accidentally—as bored well-to-do gentlemen naturally took to intramural competition in the streets and byways of mountainous downtown St. Moritz posing a risk to each other and pedestrians alike. This gave impetus to steering the sleds, and soon runners and a primitive mechanism evolved to allow some steerage along the longer curving streets of the 1870s. It also allowed higher speeds on the longer runs. Local views varied, but eventually complaints grew louder and Kulm hotel owner Caspar Badrutt built the first natural ice run for his guests, as part of his efforts to popularize wintering in the mountain resort, while careful not to lose customers to boredom, nor his workforce to injury from errant sleds on the streets.

The committee members were Major William Henry Bulpett (founder of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club), George Robertson, Charles Digby Jones (Robertson and Digby Jones planned the proposed course), C. Metcalfe, and J. Biddulph.

==The run==
The head (top) of the run is located under the remains of a 12th Century church, demolished in 1890, known as the &#x27;Leaning Tower&#x27;. The overall drop is and the gradient varies from 2.8 to 1 to 8.7 to 1 (length to drop).

The modern Cresta track is not shared with bobsled, unlike the original half-pipe sledding track built by hotelier Caspar Badrutt for his guests. Most of it is located within the contour of a steep ravine and is recreated each winter using the rocky ravine and banks of earth as a buttress for the pack ice. The run is owned and operated, created in 1885 by British military officers with the official name of the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC), but is generally referred to as &#x27;The Cresta Run&#x27;.

The course has two entrances known as &#x27;Top&#x27; and &#x27;Junction&#x27; respectively, with two banks, known as &#x27;Upper&#x27; &#x27;and &#x27;Lower&#x27;. The entrance at Junction is adjacent to the SMTC clubhouse and is about a third of the way down from Top along the run. Similarly, the exit is simply called &#x27;Finish&#x27; and given a typical average speed of more than 50 mph, an experienced rider will exit the course at more than 80 mph when riding from Top.

The track was used for the skeleton event in both the 1928 and the 1948 Winter Olympics. These were the only Olympics with skeleton until 2002.

The exclusion of women from the course, which was enforced until December 2018, dates from the late 1920s and was instituted because of injuries to female racers and the wholly incorrect belief that excessive sledding caused breast cancer. It came into effect in 1929, though women had been banned from competitive events several years earlier. Up until 2018, women were only allowed to become &quot;non-active&quot; members. In late 2018, St. Moritz Tobogganing Club meeting members voted by a two-thirds majority to allow women to ride the Cresta Run and become &quot;active&quot; members again.

== Cresta and skeleton ==

Whilst the Cresta Run is often considered to be the birthplace of modern day skeleton and acted as the course for Skeleton events in the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, Cresta &quot;riding&quot; is notably different from modern day Skeleton &quot;sliding&quot;. Cresta Riding requires significant movement on the toboggan in order to navigate the track. Such movement includes riders moving their position back and forwards on the toboggan, and actively pushing the toboggan with your right hand in order to manoeuvre through Shuttlecock and Thoma. On the other hand, modern Skeleton sliding requires much less movement on the toboggan, and the sleds are generally speaking more flexible and sensitive than those for the Cresta. Cresta Toboggans possess longer, more prominent knives on the back of the &quot;runners&quot; than their modern-day skeleton counterparts. This is in order to achieve greater grip, as unlike in modern Skeleton which takes place on Bob-Runs, one can exit the Cresta Run at numerous points if they are going too fast or are out of control.

Toboggans used by the Cresta Run are broadly separated into two primary categories: Traditionals and Flat-Tops. Traditional toboggans are the toboggans that every Cresta Rider initially starts on, and have been used since the 1900s; as an evolution of the earlier &quot;Americas&quot; toboggan. Traditionals are characterised by a prominent sliding seat and having the runners integrated into the frame. The sliding seat allows riders to move back on the toboggan prior to entry of Shuttlecock to place more weight on the knives, therefore gaining greater control and grip. Flat-Tops were introduced to the Cresta by Reto Gansser (brother of 8-time Grand National Winner Franco Gansser) in the 1960s and became the basis for modern day skeleton sleds. Flat-Tops are characterised by either a steel or carbon fibre base with removable runners. Modern-day are much more akin to Skeleton sleds, with some manufacturers providing Sleds to Olympic Skeleton teams and amateur Cresta Riders alike. Unlike the traditional toboggan, the Flat-Top lacks a moving seat, and is more sensitive and faster. As a result, the secretariat requires riders to achieve consistent rides of 48 seconds from Junction on a Traditional in order to &quot;convert&quot; to a flat-top. Converts are then taught by their &quot;Flat-Top Guru,&quot; an experienced flat top rider who is given permission by the secretariat to tutor the converts in Flat-Top riding. It is up to &quot;Tower&quot; and the Secretariat to determine whether they are a sufficiently skilled and safe rider to continue riding on a flat-top.

== The club ==
The primary purpose of the 1300 member club founded in 1887 is &quot;…the conduct of races and practice on the Cresta Run and the encouragement of tobogganing generally&quot;. While not snobbish, the Cresta Club gathers well-to-do gentlemen and is totally amateur. There are many more luge and bobsled runs world-wide, but only one Cresta devoted to head first sledding. The club asserts that most of the other sledding sports are dominated by professionals and is one of the last bastions of the genuine amateur in sport.

As in many social clubs, members are elected from a list of qualifiers called the Supplementary List. The course is open to anyone who meets the three criteria for joining the list, and need not be English. It has a lot of club rites such as the &quot;Firework&quot;, the &quot;Shuttlecock Club&quot; and a dedicated drink, the &quot;Bullshot&quot;. The highlight of the Shuttlecock Club is the yearly &quot;Shuttlecock Dinner&quot;. The dinner is organised by the Shuttlecock President. Prominent presidents have included Constantin von Liechtenstein, Gianni Agnelli, Gunther Sachs, Sir Dudley Cunliffe-Owen, Rolf Sachs, Lord Dalmeny, Graf Luca Marenzi, Marc M. K. Fischer, Lord Wrottesley, Jonny Seccombe and Sven Ley. The club sponsors more than thirty races each season which generally last from just before Christmas to late February. The track is opened as soon as it is seasonally possible to do so, and is kept open as long as natural weather conditions permit.

==Notable rider-members==

Some notably good riders from the membership of the past were Nino Bibbia, Italy; Giorgio Jegher, Jack Heaton, USA; and Billy Fiske, USA (the first American pilot killed in World War II as a volunteer in the &quot;Millionaire Squadron&quot;). In 1955 the then 71-year-old Lord Brabazon won the Cresta Run Coronation Cup at an average speed of .

Among the best riders in recent years: eight times Grand National winner was Swiss Franco Gansser, fifteen times Grand National winner Lord Wrottesley finished fourth at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and was the top record holder (49.92 in 2015), former Junction record holder Johannes Badrutt (41.02 in 1999), and current Junction record holder is German Magnus Eger (40.94 in 2017). Marcel Melcher was the youngest ever winner (aged 19, in 1979) of the Grand National.

Wing Commander Andy Green is the RAF&#x27;s team captain for the Cresta Run. Green is an established driver of land speed record cars, and holds the current land speed record which he achieved in Thrust SSC. He also drives the 1,000 mph car Bloodhound SSC.

Baron Raunchy was reported to have had the slowest ride from Junction, with a time of 380 seconds.

==Women and the Cresta==
Although since 1929 until December 2018 rules forbade women riders, it was not always so. For example, T. A. Cook records that, in 1895, various trials were made by women on the Cresta, testing different riding positions and different styles of toboggan—although at that time women riders were encouraged to use only the lower half of the course. Vera Barclay rode the Cresta Run from Top. She was followed by a young American, Charles Lowe Boorum, Jnr., who said, &quot;See you at the finish&quot;. Boorum started too fast and slid into Church Leap at such a speed that he crashed at the Shuttlecock, was hit by his toboggan and died from a fractured skull that evening.

In 2019 Carina Evans, of Britain, became the first woman to descend the Cresta Run from Top since the ban on women riders was lifted in 2018.

Towards the end of the season, there is a &quot;Ladies Event&quot; in which women compete from Junction by invitation only.

<doc id="1117939" wikidata="Q42731" url="?curid=1117939" title="Fernando Torres">
<text>Fernando José Torres Sanz (; born 20 March 1984) is a Spanish football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is the current manager of Atlético Madrid B. Due to his consistent goalscoring as a young player, Torres came to be nicknamed El Niño (&#x27;The Kid&#x27;), which stuck with him throughout his career. In his prime, he was known for his pace, prolific goalscoring, and heading.

Torres started his career with Atlético Madrid, progressing through their youth system to the first team. He made his debut in 2001 and left the club with 75 goals in 174 La Liga appearances. Torres joined Premier League club Liverpool in 2007 and became the fastest player in Liverpool history to score 50 league goals. In 2008, he finished third for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year. Striving to compete for trophies, Torres left Liverpool in January 2011 to join Chelsea for a Premier League record transfer fee of £50 million, which made him the most expensive Spanish player in history. At Chelsea, he won the FA Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and the UEFA Europa League. Torres went on to have a brief stint at AC Milan before returning to Atlético Madrid, where he won the 2017-18 UEFA Europa League. He signed for Japanese club Sagan Tosu in July 2018, before retiring from professional football after the 2019 season.

In 2003, Torres made his debut for Spain in a friendly against Portugal. He was capped 110 imes and is his country&#x27;s third-highest top goalscorer with 38 goals. With Spain, he participated in six major tournaments: UEFA Euro 2004, 2006 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012, and 2014 World Cup. Spain won the 2008, 2010, and 2012 tournaments and Torres scored in the finals of both Euro 2008 and Euro 2012. He won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals in the 2012 tournament.

==Early career==
Born in Fuenlabrada, Community of Madrid, Torres loved football as a child and joined his first youth team, Parque 84, at age five. His grandfather was an Atlético Madrid fan.

Torres began playing football as a goalkeeper. At age seven, he began playing as a striker for Mario’s Holanda, the neighbourhood’s club, using the characters from the anime &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; as inspiration. At age 10, he joined Rayo 13 and scored 55 goals in his first season. He later joined Atlético’s youth system at age 11 in 1995.

==Club career==
===Atlético Madrid===

After progressing through the ranks, Torres won his first important youth title in 1998. Atlético sent an under-15 team to compete in the Nike Cup, in Spain and Europe, to play against youth teams from other clubs; Atlético won the tournament. He was later voted the best player in Europe for the age group. In 1999, at the age of 15, Torres signed his first professional contract with Atlético. He spent his first year playing in the youth team and participated in the Honor Division when he was 16. The 2000–01 season had started poorly, as Torres suffered from a cracked shinbone which kept him out of play until December. Torres trained with the first team to get prepared for pre-season, but eventually made his debut on 27 May 2001, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, against Leganés. One week later, he scored his first goal for the club, against Albacete, and the season finished with Atlético narrowly missing out on promotion to La Liga.

Atlético were promoted to La Liga at the end of the 2001–02 season, although Torres did not perform well in the season, as he netted only 6 times in 36 appearances in the Segunda División. Torres&#x27;s first season in La Liga, 2002–03, was better, however, as he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances, with Atlético finishing in 11th place. In July 2003, soon after his takeover of the club, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had a £28 million bid for Torres rejected by Atlético&#x27;s board of directors. In the 2003–04 season, his second in La Liga, Torres made further strides, scoring 19 league goals in 35 appearances, meaning he finished as the joint third-highest scorer in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics: top scorers: 2003/2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At age 19, Torres was named Atlético&#x27;s captain. Atlético narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup, but by finishing in seventh place in the 2003–04 season, they qualified for the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup, giving Torres a first taste of a competition at the European level. He scored two goals in the two fourth round matches against OFK Beograd, with one coming in each leg. Atlético reached the final, but lost 3–1 on a penalty shoot-out to Villarreal following a 2–2 draw on aggregate. FA Premier League champions Chelsea were believed to be interested in signing Torres during the summer of 2005, but Atlético club president Enrique Cerezo said that they had &quot;no chance&quot; of signing him. Cerezo later said in January 2006 that the club was willing to listen to offers for Torres, and Torres claimed Newcastle United of the FA Premier League had made a bid to sign him in March.

Torres stated after the 2006 FIFA World Cup that he had turned down an offer to join Chelsea at the end of the 2005–06 season. He scored 14 league goals in the 2006–07 season. The English media reported that he was the main transfer target of FA Premier League club Liverpool, but Cerezo stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve received no offer from Liverpool or any other club or player.&quot; Days later, however, new reports suggested Atlético had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Torres; the fee was rumoured to be £25 million with Luis García moving to Atlético in a separate transfer deal. On 30 June, Atlético announced a deal to sign Diego Forlán from Villarreal, in what was seen as a move to replace Torres before his departure became official. On 2 July, it was reported that Torres had cut short a vacation to fly back to Madrid to finalise the move to Liverpool. The following day, Torres passed a medical at Liverpool&#x27;s Melwood training ground. He held a press conference in Madrid on 4 July to bid farewell to the Atlético fans, before completing his move to Liverpool on a six-year contract. The transfer fee was the highest in Liverpool&#x27;s history. In March 2008, manager Rafael Benítez stated in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; that Torres was acquired for around £20 million, although this figure takes into account García&#x27;s move to Atlético.

===Liverpool===
====2007–08 season====
Torres made his competitive debut for Liverpool against Aston Villa in a 2–1 win on 11 August 2007. He made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League four days past his first performance in a 1–0 victory over Toulouse, after coming on as a 79th minute substitute. His first Premier League goal came on his Anfield debut on 19 August 2007, in the 16th minute in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea. His first hat-trick came in a 4–2 victory over Reading in the League Cup on 25 September 2007, with all of his goals coming in the second half. His first goals in the Champions League came on his third appearance in the competition as Liverpool beat Porto 4–1 on 28 November 2007, as he scored twice.

Torres was named the Premier League Player of the Month for February 2008, during which he scored four goals in four appearances, including a hat-trick against Middlesbrough on 23 February 2008. This hat-trick and another in a 4–0 victory over West Ham United on 5 March 2008 meant he became the first Liverpool player since Jack Balmer in November 1946 to score a hat-trick in successive home matches. Later in March, after he scored a 47th-minute header against Reading at Anfield, he became the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler in the 1995–96 season to score 20 league goals in a season. In April, he scored another Champions League goal, this time against Arsenal in the quarter-final second leg, as Liverpool advanced to the semi-final. This goal took him onto 29 goals for the 2007–08 season in all competitions, eclipsing Michael Owen&#x27;s personal record for goals in a season. On 11 April 2008, it was announced Torres had made a six-man shortlist for the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, which was eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United. The Spanish international was also nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year Award, which was won by Cesc Fàbregas of Arsenal and was named in the PFA Team of the Year. In May, he finished second to Ronaldo for the FWA Footballer of the Year award.

On 4 May 2008, Torres scored a 57th-minute winner against Manchester City, which equalled the consecutive Anfield league goal record of eight games set by Roger Hunt. After scoring his 24th league goal in the final game of the season, a 2–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, he set a new record for the most prolific foreign goal scorer in a debut season in England, eclipsing Ruud van Nistelrooy&#x27;s 23 goals. He ended the season in joint second place with Emmanuel Adebayor in the race for the Premier League golden boot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics: top scorers: 2007/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Torres was subject to media speculation that Chelsea were willing to pay £50 million to sign him, but Torres responded by saying it would be &quot;many years&quot; before he left Liverpool. Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks also negated the idea of a transfer, saying he would not allow Torres to leave the club at any price.

====2008–09 season====
Torres made a scoring start to the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom right-hand corner away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out for two to three weeks. Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres&#x27;s former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008.

Torres made his return for Liverpool on 8 November 2008 after coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 3–0 victory against West Bromwich Albion. He said he would be interested in returning to former club Atlético eventually, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I will retire there, but I would like to go back and finish some things that are left to do.&quot; He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain, which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists. He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December, and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup. He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009. Despite having spent a year and a half at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 greatest Liverpool players&quot;, reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time.

Torres faced his old rivals Real Madrid on 10 March 2009 in the Champions League last 16 and due to an ankle injury, he had a painkilling injection before the game to enable him to play. He scored the first goal of the game, which ended as a 4–0 victory, meaning Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals 5–0 on aggregate. Four days later, he lined up against Manchester United at Old Trafford and he scored the equaliser in a game that finished as a 4–1 victory. His goal celebration at Old Trafford endeared him to Liverpool fans when he held out his hand to United fans – making the &quot;five times&quot; gesture –
signifying Liverpool&#x27;s five Champions League titles (to United&#x27;s three). He was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the second season running in April 2009. Torres scored his 50th goal for Liverpool on 24 May 2009 against Tottenham on the final day of the 2008–09 season, his 84th appearance.

====2009–10 season====

Following the end of the season, Torres agreed a new contract with Liverpool, which he signed on 14 August. By signing, Torres had the option of a one-year extension after the contract&#x27;s expiration in 2013. Torres scored two goals in a 3–2 win over West Ham United on 19 September 2009, a result that took Liverpool to third in the Premier League. One week later, he scored his first hat-trick of the 2009–10 Premier League season in a 6–1 victory over Hull City at Anfield. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for September, after scoring five goals during the month and becoming the Premier League&#x27;s top goalscorer. On 25 October 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 victory for Liverpool over Manchester United, after which Rafael Benítez praised Torres&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;We were waiting for that final pass. When it came we knew he would score.&quot; 

Torres was named in the FIFPro World XI for the second successive season in December 2009. His stoppage-time winning goal against Aston Villa on 29 December 2009 made him the fastest Liverpool player ever to score 50 league goals. He was substituted on 65 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City on 4 April 2010, which Benítez justified by saying Torres was &quot;exhausted&quot;. Torres made his last appearance of the season scoring twice in a 4–1 victory over Benfica in the Europa League on 8 April 2010, and it was announced on 18 April that he would miss the rest of the season to undergo knee surgery. This meant that Torres finished the season with 22 goals in 32 games in all competitions, finishing as Liverpool&#x27;s top scorer for the second time.

====2010–11 season====

Following Roy Hodgson&#x27;s appointment as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres would not be sold by the club, saying, &quot;He is not for sale and we don&#x27;t welcome any offers for him. We want to keep him.&quot; Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, &quot;He has told us that he is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous.&quot; Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: &quot;My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed.&quot;

Torres made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season in the opening match, a 1–1 draw with Arsenal on 14 August 2010, entering the game as a substitute in the 74th minute. He scored his first goal of the season with the winner in a 1–0 victory over West Brom on 29 August 2010, his 50th goal at Anfield in all competitions. Torres scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory at home to Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2010, his first goal since August. He scored his final goals for Liverpool in a 3–0 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2011.

===Chelsea===
On 27 January 2011, Torres was the subject of a £40 million bid from Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s Chelsea, which was rejected by Liverpool. He handed in an official transfer request to Liverpool the next day, which was rejected. Torres completed his move to Chelsea on a five-and-a-half-year contract on 31 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee reported to be £50 million, which set a new record for a British transfer and made him the sixth most expensive footballer in history. He made his Chelsea debut on 6 February 2011 in a 1–0 home defeat to former club Liverpool. On 23 April 2011, Torres scored his first goal for Chelsea against West Ham United in a 3–0 victory, which ended a run of 903 minutes of football without a goal. This was his only goal for Chelsea in the 2010–11 season, having made 18 appearances for his new club.

====2011–12 season====
Torres got the 2011–12 season underway in Chelsea&#x27;s 0–0 draw away against Stoke City on 14 August 2011, in which his &quot;link-up play was sharp, plus he was willing to make intelligent runs into space to receive the ball&quot;. He scored his second goal at Chelsea, and his first of the season, on 18 September 2011, in a 3–1 away defeat to Manchester United. However, that was overshadowed by his miss at an open goal. He scored his second goal of the season at home to Swansea City in a 4–1 victory. Ten minutes after his goal, however, a two-footed challenge on Mark Gower resulted in his first red card in English football and a three-match domestic suspension. On 19 October 2011, Torres scored two goals in a 5–0 victory against Genk in the Champions League, his first in Europe since the quarter-final of the 2008–09 Champions League with his old club Liverpool, against Chelsea. His next Chelsea goals came after scoring twice and also assisting two others against Championship team Leicester City in an FA Cup quarter-final on 18 March 2012, ending a goal drought that stretched 24 games. On 31 March 2012, Torres scored his first Premier League goal since 24 September 2011, against Aston Villa in a 4–2 away win.

Torres came on as a substitute for Didier Drogba on 24 April 2012 to score a last-minute goal against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final, which gave Chelsea a 2–2 draw, and cemented Barcelona&#x27;s elimination from the tournament. Chelsea were already winning on the away goals rule, but finally won on aggregate score (3–2). He scored the first hat-trick of his Chelsea career in a 6–1 win against Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge on 29 April 2012. Torres came on in the second half of the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final on 19 May 2012, directly after Bayern Munich&#x27;s opening goal, and following a 1–1 draw after extra time Chelsea won the penalty shoot-out 4–3. His first full season at Chelsea finished with 11 goals in 49 appearances.

====2012–13 season====
Torres started the 2012–13 season in the 2012 FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Villa Park, where he scored the opening goal, as Chelsea lost 3–2. On 19 August 2012, he appeared in Chelsea&#x27;s first league match in a 2–0 away win against Wigan Athletic. Torres scored his first goal of the season in Chelsea&#x27;s next match on 22 August 2012, a 4–2 home win against Reading, scoring the third goal to give his side the lead. He also scored against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Norwich City as Chelsea topped the table in the early weeks of the season.

Torres was sent off for receiving two yellow cards against Manchester United on 28 October 2012, the second for diving, leaving Chelsea with nine men after teammate Branislav Ivanović was also sent off; the team went on to lose 3–2. Torres scored his first goal in the Champions League for the season after deflecting Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov&#x27;s clearance into goal, as Chelsea needed a 94th-minute winner from Victor Moses to secure a 3–2 victory on 7 November 2012. On 21 November 2012, Roberto Di Matteo was replaced as Chelsea manager by Rafael Benítez, who had previously coached Torres at Liverpool. It was reported that one reason for Benítez&#x27;s appointment was to help Torres return to his best form.

Torres ended a goal drought that stretched over 11 hours of game time with two goals in Chelsea&#x27;s 6–1 defeat of Nordsjælland in the Champions League on 5 December 2012. Three days later, he scored another two goals, ending a run of eight Premier League games without a goal, as Chelsea defeated Sunderland 3–1. He then scored in Chelsea&#x27;s 2012 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final 3–1 win against Monterrey of the Mexican Liga MX on 13 December 2012, before playing in the 1–0 defeat to Brazilian Série A side Corinthians in the final three days later.

On 14 March 2013, Torres scored the third goal as Chelsea defeated Steaua București 3–1 to advance 3–2 on aggregate to the quarter-final of the Europa League. With this goal, Torres became the first player to score in seven different competitions in one season. He scored twice against Rubin Kazan in the 3–1 win in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final on 4 April 2013, before scoring again in the second leg 3–2 defeat, with Chelsea progressing to the semi-final 5–4 on aggregate. Torres scored the opening goal in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–1 triumph over Benfica in the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final on 15 May 2013. During the final match of the season, a 2–1 home win over Everton, he scored his first league goal of 2013, and finished the season with 22 goals in 64 matches.

====2013–14 season====

Torres was selected to start by Chelsea&#x27;s new manager José Mourinho against Hull City on the opening day of the 2013–14 season, where he won a fifth-minute penalty kick. He scored his first goal of the season in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup against Bayern Munich. On 28 September 2013, he was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–1 Premier League draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.

Torres made his 100th start for Chelsea against Schalke 04 in a Champions League match on 22 October 2013 and marked the occasion by scoring two goals in a 3–0 win. His first Premier League goal of the season came on 27 October as he scored the winning goal in the 90th minute over title challengers Manchester City, while also providing the assist for André Schürrle&#x27;s opener.

===AC Milan===
Torres joined Italian Serie A club AC Milan on a two-year loan on 31 August 2014. He debuted on 20 September, replacing Andrea Poli for the last 14 minutes of a 1–0 home defeat against Juventus and scored his first Milan goal with a looping header in their 2–2 draw with Empoli two days later.

===Return to Atlético Madrid===
On 27 December 2014, it was announced that Torres&#x27;s move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015, but two days later, he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atlético Madrid on loan until the end of the 2015–16 season. The loan was agreed after Alessio Cerci went the opposite way from Atlético to Milan on the same day. Torres&#x27;s unveiling at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 4 January drew a crowd of 45,000 persons. He played the first match of his second spell on 7 January, starting in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last 16 tie against Real Madrid. He had no shots on target and was replaced by Koke after 59 minutes, but Atlético won 2–0. Eight days later in the second leg, he scored two goals – in the first minute of each half – as Atlético advanced, his first goals in an away Madrid derby. Torres scored in the first minute again in the quarter-finals, albeit in a 2–3 home defeat against Barcelona.
Torres scored the winning kick in Atlético&#x27;s 3–2 penalty shoot-out defeat of Bayer Leverkusen in the second leg of the teams&#x27; Champions League round of 16 tie on 17 March 2015. Four days later, he scored his first La Liga goal since his return in the third minute of a 2–0 win against Getafe.

On 6 February 2016, Torres scored his 100th goal with Atlético Madrid in a 3–1 home league victory against Eibar on his 295th appearance for the club. The following month, he marked his 300th appearance for Atlético by scoring in a 3–1 victory over Valencia. He scored the opening goal of Atlético&#x27;s UEFA Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona at the Camp Nou on 5 April, before being sent off ten minutes later in an eventual 2–1 loss.

Torres signed for Atlético permanently on 5 July 2016, on a one-year contract. In February 2017, he scored his 100th league goal in Spanish football when he netted a brace against Leganés. On 4 July 2017, Torres signed a new one-year contract with the &quot;Rojiblancos&quot; to stay with his boyhood club for one more year after they were banned from signing new players.

Torres came on as a 90th-minute substitute on 16 May 2018 as Atlético beat Marseille 3–0 at Parc Olympique Lyonnais in the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final. He scored two goals in his last match with Atlético in a 2–2 draw versus Eibar in the final week of championship.

===Sagan Tosu and retirement===
Torres signed for J1 League club Sagan Tosu on 10 July 2018. He scored his first goal for the club on 22 August in the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, netting in a fourth round victory over Vissel Kobe. His first league goal followed five days later when he scored once and assisted a further two in a 3–0 win over Gamba Osaka. On 21 June 2019, Torres announced that he would retire from football. He made his farewell in a J1 League match against Vissel Kobe on 23 August 2019, when he faced former Spain teammates Andrés Iniesta and David Villa. The game ended in a 6–1 defeat for Sagan Tosu.

==International career==
===2001–02: Success at youth level===
In February 2001, Torres won the Algarve Tournament with the Spain national under-16 team. The under-16s took part in the 2001 UEFA European Under-16 Championship in May, which they also won, with Torres scoring the only goal in the final, as well as finishing as the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer, and was also named the player of the tournament. In September 2001, Torres represented the under-17 team at the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship, but the team failed to progress through the group stage. In July 2002, he won the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship with the under-19 team and was again the only goalscorer in the final. Also, he finished as top scorer and was named player of the tournament.

===2003–06: Senior debut and early years===

Torres debuted for the Spanish senior squad on 6 September 2003 in a friendly against Portugal, scoring his first goal against Italy on 28 April 2004. He was selected for the Spanish squad for UEFA Euro 2004. After appearing as a late substitute in Spain&#x27;s first two group games, he started for the deciding game against Portugal. Spain were losing 1–0 and, towards the end of the game, he hit the post.
Torres scored 7 goals in 11 appearances in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, making him Spain&#x27;s top scorer for qualification, including a vital two goals against Belgium and his first international hat-trick against San Marino. At his first ever appearance in a FIFA World Cup finals at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Torres scored the final goal in a 4–0 victory over Ukraine with a volley. In the second group match, Torres scored twice against Tunisia, first in the 76th minute to take Spain 2–1 into the lead, and then again from a penalty kick in the 90th. With three goals, he finished the tournament as Spain&#x27;s top scorer alongside fellow striker David Villa.

===2007–08: European Champions===
Torres was called up for Spain&#x27;s Euro 2008 squad, where he set up Villa to score Spain&#x27;s first goal of the tournament in the first game in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under criticism for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually &quot;irritated with himself&quot;. He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain&#x27;s next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it&#x27;s the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world.&quot; He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner David Villa in the Team of the Tournament.

===2009–10: World Cup champions===
Torres made his 60th appearance for Spain in a 2010 World Cup qualification victory over Turkey on 28 March 2009, becoming the youngest player to reach this milestone.

Torres was named in Spain&#x27;s team for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in June. He scored his second hat-trick for Spain after 17 minutes into a Confederations Cup match against New Zealand on 14 June, thus recording the fastest hat-trick by a player for Spain. He played for Spain as they were defeated 2–0 by the United States in the semi-final, as well as the third-place play-off, which Spain won 3–2 against South Africa after extra time.

Having undergone knee surgery on 18 April 2010, and missing the end of the Premier League season, Torres&#x27;s rehabilitation and fitness was closely monitored by Spain manager Vicente del Bosque. Although still out injured, Torres was selected for Spain&#x27;s 2010 FIFA World Cup squad in May. On 8 June, Torres made his first appearance on the field in exactly two months, coming on as a substitute on 66 minutes against Poland in a pre-World Cup friendly.

Torres came on as a substitute on 61 minutes in Spain&#x27;s opening World Cup match on 16 June, a 1–0 defeat to Switzerland. He started the next two matches against Honduras and Chile and although his performances in the group stage were described as below-par, he received backing from Del Bosque. Torres came on as a substitute on 105 minutes in the final as Spain won the World Cup for the first time following a 1–0 victory over the Netherlands on 11 July 2010.

===2011–12: Euro 2012 glory===
Torres was selected in Del Bosque&#x27;s Euro 2012 squad. In his first start of the tournament, he netted two goals as Spain defeated the Republic of Ireland 4–0 to eliminate them from the tournament. In the tournament final, Torres came on as a substitute against Italy, scoring one goal and assisting another, as Spain won a second consecutive European Championship with a 4–0 victory. This secured him the Golden Boot for the tournament with three goals and one assist, having played fewer minutes than Mario Gómez, who also had three goals and one assist.

Torres won his 100th cap against Saudi Arabia on 7 September 2012, making him the sixth-highest capped player for Spain, and started the game as captain in goalkeeper Iker Casillas&#x27; absence.

===2013–14: Confederations Cup top scorer and final World Cup===
He became the first player in history to score four goals in one game in a FIFA Confederations Cup match during a 10–0 win over Tahiti on 20 June 2013 in the 2013 Confederations Cup. Torres also became the first player to score two hat-tricks in the Confederations Cup, and with five goals and one assist won the tournament&#x27;s Golden Shoe, ahead of Fred having played fewer minutes.

In his first international for 11 months, Torres scored a penalty in a World Cup warm-up match against Bolivia on 30 May 2014. The day after, he was named in Spain&#x27;s final squad for the tournament, ahead of Álvaro Negredo and Fernando Llorente. After substitute appearances in the team&#x27;s opening two matches, Torres was named in the starting line-up for the third group match with the team&#x27;s elimination already confirmed. He scored Spain&#x27;s second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Australia in Curitiba.

==Style of play==
Torres was described as having &quot;an eye for the spectacular&quot; and being &quot;capable of world-class skill&quot;, as well as being regarded as a &quot;technically proficient, highly successful striker&quot;. He had the ability to find open spaces and capitalize on defensive errors. A hard-working striker, Torres was known for chasing down and putting pressure on opposing defenders. He was also capable of creating chances for other attackers; this also saw him being deployed in a deeper role as a second striker on occasion.

Due to his consistent goalscoring as a young player, Torres was nicknamed &quot;El Niño&quot; (&#x27;The Kid&#x27;). He could score with his head and both feet. In his prime (2007-2010), his prolific goalscoring earned him a reputation as the best striker in the world at that time. Prior to the 2009 Confederations Cup, the &quot;CBC&quot; described him as: &quot;The golden boy of Spanish soccer and one of the most dangerous forwards in the game. Nicknamed El Niño (The Kid), Torres is coming off a solid second season for Liverpool in which he scored 14 goals. Torres is lightning quick, a deadly finisher and a player of such high class with the ball at his feet that he routinely makes the spectacular look ordinary.&quot; However, Torres lost most of his pace and form in later seasons due to injuries.

==Coaching career==
On 25 July 2021, Torres became head coach of Atlético Madrid’s Juvenil A (U19) team. On 11 June 2024, he became head coach of Atlético Madrid B. His debut on the first day of the Primera Federación season was a 1–0 home loss to Atlético Sanluqueño.

==Personal life==
Torres&#x27;s parents are José Torres and Flori Sanz. He married Olalla Domínguez Liste on 27 May 2009 in a private ceremony in El Escorial, Madrid. The couple have three children: two daughters and a son.

Torres featured in a video for &quot;Ya nada volverá a ser como antes&quot; by Spanish pop rock group El Canto del Loco, and the singer, Dani Martín, is friends with him. In 2009, he released an autobiography entitled &quot;Torres: El Niño: My Story&quot;. Torres likes the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and has a tattoo of his name in Tengwar on his left forearm.

In 2011, a stadium in Fuenlabrada was built in his honor.

<doc id="1117940" wikidata="Q4781149" url="?curid=1117940" title="Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.">
<text>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 (3d Cir. 1983), was the first time an appellate level court in the United States held that a computer&#x27;s BIOS could be protected by copyright. As second impact, this ruling clarified that binary code, the machine readable form of software and firmware, was copyrightable too and not only the human-readable source code form of software.

Franklin Computer Corporation introduced the Franklin Ace 1000, a clone of Apple Computer&#x27;s Apple II, in 1982. Apple quickly determined that substantial portions of the Franklin ROM and operating system had been copied directly from Apple&#x27;s versions, and on May 12, 1982, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It cited the presence of some of the same embedded strings, such as the name &quot;James Huston&quot; (an Apple programmer), and &quot;Applesoft,&quot; on both the Apple and Franklin system disks.

Franklin admitted that it had copied Apple&#x27;s software but argued that it would have been impractical to independently write its own versions of the software and maintain compatibility, although it said it had written its own version of Apple&#x27;s copy utility and was working on its own versions of other software. Franklin argued that because Apple&#x27;s software existed only in machine-readable form, and not in printed form, and because some of the software did not contain copyright notices, it could be freely copied. The Apple II firmware was likened to a machine part whose form was dictated entirely by the requirements of compatibility (that is, an exact copy of Apple&#x27;s ROM was the only part that would &quot;fit&quot; in an Apple-compatible computer and enable its intended function), and was therefore not copyrightable.

The district court found in favor of Franklin. However, Apple appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which, in a separate case decided three days after Franklin won at the lower level, had determined that both a program existing only in a written form unreadable to humans (e.g. object code) and one embedded on a ROM were protected by copyright. (See &quot;Williams Elec., Inc., v. Artic Int&#x27;l, Inc.&quot;, 685 F.2d 870 (1982)). The Court of Appeals overturned the district court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Franklin&quot; by applying its holdings in &quot;Williams&quot; and going further to hold that operating systems were also copyrightable. The Court remanded the case to the District Court for a determination regarding whether Apple&#x27;s operating system was one of a very limited number of ways to achieve its function. If it was, then Franklin would not be liable for copyright infringement. The parties settled.

Apple was able to force Franklin to withdraw its clones by 1988. The company later brought non-infringing clones to market, but as these models were only partially compatible with the Apple II, and as the Apple II architecture was by this time outdated in any case, they enjoyed little success in the marketplace.

IBM believed that IBM PC clone makers such as Eagle Computer and Corona Data Systems similarly infringed on its copyright, and after &quot;Apple v. Franklin&quot; successfully forced them to stop using the BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS in 1984, however, and similar products such as AMI BIOS, which were clean-room engineered and did not contain any of IBM&#x27;s code, permitted computer makers to legally build essentially 100% PC-compatible clones without having to reverse engineer the PC BIOS themselves.

Another impact of the decision was the rise of the shrink-wrap proprietary software commercial business model, where before a source code driven software distribution schema dominated.

<text>The College Football Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and interactive attraction devoted to college American football. The National Football Foundation (NFF) founded the Hall in 1951 to immortalize the players and coaches of college football that were voted first team All-American by the media.

In August 2014, the Chick-fil-A College Football Hall of Fame opened in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The facility is a attraction located in the heart of Atlanta&#x27;s sports, entertainment and tourism district, and is adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park.

==History==

===Early plans===
In 1949, Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was selected as the site for football&#x27;s Hall of Fame, via a vote by thousands of sportswriters, coaches, and athletic leaders. Rutgers was chosen for the location because Rutgers and Princeton played the first game of intercollegiate football in New Brunswick on November 6, 1869.

Secondary plans in 1967 called for the Hall of Fame to be located at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the location of the first contest under rules now considered to be those of modern football, between teams from Rutgers and the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University; Rutgers won 6–4. Rutgers donated land near its football stadium, office space, and administrative support. After years of collecting donations starting in 1949 for the construction of the building with ground not having been broken and no plans to do so, the New Jersey Attorney General began an investigation of the finances of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s foundation, the National Football Foundation. In response, the Foundation moved its operations to New York City, where it continued to collect donations for several years.

===Kings Mills===
When the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office began its own investigation, the foundation moved to Kings Mills, Ohio in suburban Cincinnati, where a building finally was constructed adjacent to Kings Island in 1978. In choosing the site, it had been hoped that the museum could attract the same visitors attending the adjacent Kings Island amusement park, but this failed to happen. The Hall opened with good attendance figures early on, but visitation dwindled dramatically as time went on and never truly met projections. Attendance, which had been projected to be 300,000 annually, peaked at 80,000 per year and dwindled to 30,000 per year. The facility closed in 1992. Nearby Galbreath Field remained open as the home of Moeller High School football until 2003. In 2024, Mercy Health Kings Mills Hospital opened on the site.

===South Bend===


In September 1991, the National Football Foundation opened a national search for a new location, soliciting bids from cities. It first started by offering bids to cities with local National Football Foundation chapters. Thirty-five such cities replied, including South Bend, Indiana.

The South Bend bid proposal was led by Bill Starks and Edward &quot;Moose&quot; Krause of the South Bend chapter of the National Football Foundation, who then approached South Bend mayor Joe E. Kernan about the concept. Kernan brought the concept to the city&#x27;s Project Future department, tasked with bringing new attractions to the city to assist its economic development. Patrick McMahon, Project Future&#x27;s executive director, collaborated with over a hundred people to craft a proposal for South Bend to host the Hall of Fame, which was presented to the National Football Foundation in November 1992. The proposal slated for a $14 million facility to be constructed in South Bend&#x27;s downtown. Several sites in the city had been explored, such as a site near the Indiana Toll Road and various sites in the city&#x27;s downtown, but a location near Century Center was the top choice.

On July 13, 1992, William Pearce, chairman of the National Football Foundation, made the announcement that South Bend had won the bid to host the Hall of Fame&#x27;s new location. South Bend had beaten out other locales, including Atlanta, Houston, the New Jersey Meadowlands, New Orleans.

The new location was opened in South Bend, Indiana, on August 25, 1995. Despite estimates that the South Bend location would attract more than 150,000 visitors a year, the Hall of Fame drew about 115,000 people the first year, and about 60,000 annually after that.

By the late 1990s, some had already begun to criticize the Hall of Fame in South Bend as a failure, due to a lack of corporate sponsorship and poor turnout even during special events.

In September 2009, Archie Manning, the chairman of the National Football Foundation, announced that the museum would be moving to Atlanta. The South Bend location closed in December of 2012.

===Atlanta===
In 2009, the National Football Foundation decided to move the College Football Hall of Fame to Atlanta, Georgia. The possibility of moving the museum has been brought up in other cities, including Dallas, which had the financial backing of multi-millionaire T. Boone Pickens. However, the National Football Foundation ultimately decided on Atlanta for the next site. The new $68.5 million museum opened on August 23, 2014. It is located next to Centennial Olympic Park, which is near other attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, CNN Center, and the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. The Hall of Fame is located near the Georgia Institute of Technology of the ACC (home to the oldest stadium in Division I FBS, Bobby Dodd Stadium), 10 blocks from Georgia State University of the Sun Belt Conference, and roughly from the University of Georgia of the SEC. The new building broke ground on January 28, 2013. Sections of the architecture are reminiscent of a football in shape.

The facility is and contains approximately of exhibit and event space, interactive displays and a 45-yard indoor football field. Atlanta Hall Management operates the College Football Hall of Fame.

During the George Floyd Protests on May 29, 2020, the Hall of Fame was damaged and looted by protesters. Hall of Fame CEO Kimberly Beaudin told ESPN that only the gift shop was looted, adding that &quot;no artifacts or displays were damaged&quot;. In 2022, civil rights icon and Pitt Hall of Famer Bobby Grier along with family and Blake Van Leer were invited for a VIP tour. Grier&#x27;s football story is being made into a future film.

==Inductees==
As of 2018, there are 997 players and 217 coaches enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame, representing 308 schools. Thirteen players, two coaches and one inanimate object (the Goodyear Blimp) were slated for induction in 2019.

===Players by school===
==Criteria for induction==
The National Football Foundation outlines specific criteria that may be used for evaluating a possible candidate for induction into the Hall of Fame.

# A player must have received major first team All-America recognition.
# A player becomes eligible for consideration 10 years after his last year of intercollegiate football played.
# Football achievements are considered first, but the post-football record as a citizen is also weighed.
# Players must have played their last year of intercollegiate football within the last 50 years. 
# The nominee must have ended his professional athletic career prior to the time of the nomination.
# Coaches must have at least 10 years of head coaching experience, coached 100 games, and had at least a .600 winning percentage.

The eligibility criteria have changed over time, and have occasionally led to criticism.

<doc id="1117945" wikidata="Q1247086" url="?curid=1117945" title="Greek art">
<text>Greek art began in the Cycladic and Minoan civilization, and gave birth to Western classical art in the subsequent Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (with further developments during the Hellenistic Period). It absorbed influences of Eastern civilizations, of Roman art and its patrons, and the new religion of Orthodox Christianity in the Byzantine era and absorbed Italian and European ideas during the period of Romanticism (with the invigoration of the Greek Revolution), until the Modernist and Postmodernist. 
Greek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making.

== Ancient period ==

Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek Cycladic and the Minoan civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient Egypt.

There are three scholarly divisions of the stages of later ancient Greek art that correspond roughly with historical periods of the same names. These are the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The Archaic period is usually dated from 1000 BC. The Persian Wars of 480 BC to 448 BC are usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC is regarded as the event separating the Classical from the Hellenistic period. Of course, different forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and varied to a degree from artist to artist. There was a sharp transition from one period to another.

The art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of sculpture and architecture. In the West, the art of the Roman Empire was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in Greco-Buddhist art, with ramifications as far as Japan. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Pottery was either blue with black designs or black with blue designs.

== Byzantine period ==

Byzantine art is the term created for the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire.)
The term can also be used for the art of states which were contemporary with the Byzantine Empire and shared a common culture with it, without actually being part of it, such as Bulgaria, or Russia, and also Venice, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. It can also be used for the art of people of the former Byzantine Empire under the rule of Ottoman Empire after 1453. In some respects, the Byzantine artistic tradition has continued in Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

Byzantine art grew from the art of ancient Greece and, at least before 1453, never lost sight of its classical heritage, but was distinguished from it in a number of ways. The most profound of these was that the humanist ethic of ancient Greek art was replaced by the Christian ethic. If the purpose of classical art was the glorification of man, the purpose of Byzantine art was the glorification of God.

In place of the nude, the figures of God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs of Christian tradition were elevated and became the dominant - indeed almost exclusive - focus of Byzantine art. One of the most important forms of Byzantine art was, and still is, the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school, it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first signiand the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

== Post-Byzantine and modern period ==

&quot;Cretan School&quot; describes the school of icon painting, also known as &quot;Post-Byzantine art&quot;, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.

The &quot;Heptanese School&quot; of painting (, also known as the &quot;Ionian Islands&#x27; School&quot;) succeeded the Cretan School as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the Ionian Islands, which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.

Modern Greek art, after the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, began to be developed around the time of Romanticism. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country&#x27;s geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. Munich, as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek &quot;Munich School&quot; (Greek academic art of the 19th century). Nikolaos Gysis was an important teacher and artist at the Munich Academy and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists. Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. Theodoros Vryzakis specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 Greek War of Independence. Nikiphoros Lytras concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. Georgios Jakobides devoted his attention to infants and children and he would laterbecome the first Director of the new National Gallery of Athens. Georgios Roilos was another leading painter of the period closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. Konstantinos Volanakis was inspired mostly by the Greek sea.

Other notable painters of the era are Theodore Ralli, Ioannis Altamouras and the folk painter Theofilos Hatzimichail. Notable sculptors of the era are Leonidas Drosis (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis.

<text>Leopold (, c. 1108 – 18 October 1141), known as Leopold the Generous (), was margrave of Austria (appearing in lists as Leopold IV) from 1136, and duke of Bavaria from 1139 until his death in 1141.

==Biography==
He was one of the younger sons of Margrave Leopold III, the Holy. It is not known why he was originally preferred to his brothers Adalbert and Henry Jasomirgott.

Through his mother Agnes, he was related to the Hohenstaufen. In the course of their struggle against the competing Welfen family, he was given the formerly Welfish Bavaria as a fief by Emperor Conrad III. He managed to maintain his position there, as his brother Otto was Bishop of Freising there.

The most important measure of his short reign was the &quot;Exchange of Mautern&quot; entered into with the Bishop of Passau in 1137. The bishop was given the St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Vienna, while the Margrave received extended stretches of land from the bishop outside the city walls, with the notable exception of the territory where a new church was to be built, which was to become St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral.

Leopold died unexpectedly at Niederaltaich Abbey in Bavaria and was succeeded by his brother Henry.

<text>Thursday Next is the protagonist in a series of comic fantasy, alternate history mystery novels by the British author Jasper Fforde. She was introduced for the first time in Fforde&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, released on 19 July 2001 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. , the series comprises seven books, in two series. The first series is made up of the novels &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;, &quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot; and &quot;Something Rotten&quot;. The second series is so far made up of &quot;First Among Sequels&quot;, &quot;One of Our Thursdays Is Missing&quot; and &quot;The Woman Who Died a Lot&quot;. As of November 2023, the next novel, Dark Reading Matter, is planned for 2025. 

==Background==
Thursday is the daughter of Wednesday Next and Colonel Next, a former agent with Special Operations Network department 12 (SO-12), known as the Chronoguard. She has two brothers, Anton and Joffy. Anton, however, was killed in the Crimean War.

In the novel&#x27;s parallel universe, England is a republic, with George Formby as its first president, elected following the success of Operation Sea Lion (the mooted Nazi invasion of Great Britain), occupation, and liberation. There is no United Kingdom, and Wales is the independent &quot;Socialist Republic of Wales&quot;. The Crimean War is still being waged in 1985, Russia still has a Czar, and the Whig Party still exists in the House of Commons.

In this universe, genetic engineering is advanced, allowing Thursday to have a pet dodo – a rare Version 1.2 – Pickwick. Re-engineered mammoths can cause damage to local gardens if in their path, and there is a Neanderthal rights movement, given the resurrection of this kindred branch of human evolution. The duck is extinct in this universe. Computer and aviation technology are far behind our own timeline, with the transistor having never been invented (computers are still massive and run on vacuum tubes) and research into the jet engine unfunded as propeller and dirigible technology are viewed as &#x27;good enough&#x27;.

The Goliath Corporation is a megalithic company that appears to make many of the goods in this alternate world and also acts as a de facto shadow government, being able to take over important police investigations.

In the world of Thursday Next, literature is a much more popular medium than in our world, and Thursday is a member of SO-27, the Literary Detectives or LiteraTecs. Her work is centered on Swindon, where she, her husband, infant, and mother live. The importance that literature has in this alternate England is reflected in the fact that so many people want to change their name to that of famous authors that some must be numbered, by law- e.g. John Milton 432. &#x27;WillSpeak&#x27; machines are often to be found in public places, such as railway stations - these contain a mannequin of a Shakespearian character and will quote that character&#x27;s most famous speeches upon payment.

In addition, the line between literature and reality becomes increasingly thin, allowing characters in the books and those in &#x27;real life&#x27; to jump in and out of novels. This leads Thursday to change the ending of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, the joke being that the plot we know in our reality is the far superior change caused by Thursday. This also happens to other classic novels: &quot;Uriah Heep&quot; becomes the obsequious, and generally insincere character we know, due to an accident inside the book world, and Thursday&#x27;s uncle Mycroft becomes Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s brother.

Thursday also finds that the characters in novels are self-aware, knowing they are in a book. They make comments stating they are not needed until page &#x27;such and such,&#x27; rather like actors in a play, and thus have time to help Thursday.

The world of fiction has its own police force – Jurisfiction – to ensure that plots in books continue to run smoothly with each reading. Thursday ends up hiding in a book, and working for Jurisfiction. The book &quot;Caversham Heights&quot; is a detective novel featuring Detective Inspector Jack Spratt and his sergeant, Mary Mary, (listed as Mary Jones in WOLP) who swaps with Thursday. Spratt and Mary get their own Fforde series, The Nursery Crime Division books, and appear in &quot;The Big Over Easy&quot; and &quot;The Fourth Bear&quot; featuring crimes against characters in classic children&#x27;s literature.

==Biography==

Thursday is in her mid-thirties at the start of the first book, and, by the end of it, had married Landen Parke-Laine. Thursday juggles her work in Swindon and the world of fiction, battling the machinations of the insidious Goliath Corporation, members of the Hades family and other evils at every turn.

Her biographer and stalker, &quot;Millon de Floss&quot;, reveals more about her life at the beginnings of chapters in &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;, &quot;The Well of Lost Plots&quot; and &quot;Something Rotten&quot;.

Her father, Colonel Next, is a rogue member of the ChronoGuard (SpecOps 12), a temporal policing agency, and officially does not exist, having been eradicated by his former bosses (using the simple but effective method of a timely knock on the door just before his conception; despite this, his children and grandchild still exist, likely due to Thursday&#x27;s son Friday Next being the eventual head of the ChronoGuard, and/or the extensive powers of Colonel Next himself). The elder Next does, however, remain at large throughout the time-space continuum, and still frequently finds time to visit Thursday, usually by stopping time around her so they can talk without his being arrested by the ChronoGuard. Colonel Next&#x27;s first name is unknown to everybody but him, a consequence of his eradication. Thursday has two brothers, Anton, who died in the Crimean War, and Joffy, who is a minister for the Global Standard Deity (GSD).

Thursday also has a pet dodo called Pickwick. Although dodos had been extinct for some time, in Fforde&#x27;s fictional universe they have been reintroduced through cloning, a popular hobby. Pickwick was 12 years old in 1985, when &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; was set, and has some unusual characteristics, including missing wings. She is a version 1.2 dodo, and the DNA sequencing wasn&#x27;t complete until the release of version1.7. Although initially Thursday Next believed Pickwick to be male, she later turned out to be female when she laid an egg. Her noise is represented as &quot;plock plock&quot; in the books.

Around Thursday Next a fictional world was created, reflected on several websites of the fictional organisations.

==Bookworld==
The BookWorld is a fictitious and complex environment that acts as a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; area of books. The BookWorld is most likely &quot;created&quot; by what is known as the Great Panjandrum, a person/thing that is thought to be of the highest of authority, yet is never present, acting as a god of sorts to the BookWorld. As the word panjandrum means someone in high authority, this reaffirms this possibility.

Consisting of 52 levels total, the Great Library acts as a lobby of sorts for the BookWorld and serves as a public gateway onto any book ever created. 26 of the upper levels, organized according to the author&#x27;s last name, are laid out in a cross shape, with 4 rows of bookcases radiating from a central point. In order to determine whether bookjumping into a book of choice is deemed appropriate or not, the book cover is either green, for &quot;open&quot;, or red for &quot;unavailable&quot;. At the top of the Great Library is a large dome that appears to see a large forest like area below, with other Great Libraries in the distance; there being one for every language. The 26 basements, known as the Well of Lost Plots, hold unpublished works, although whether they are arranged alphabetically by level or not has yet to be discovered. Books which are not published are scrapped, and their text recycled for future works. The Cheshire Cat is the librarian of the Great Library, although due to redistricting in England since the book in which he appears was written, the Cheshire Cat is now known as the Cat Formerly Known as Cheshire, or Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat.

The &quot;engine room&quot; of BookWorld, Text Grand Central uses so-called &quot;storycode engines&quot; to observe changes in books and allow the reader to read books using a complex &quot;imaginotransference system&quot; to supposedly continue the images being created in the reader&#x27;s mind.

Within the depths of the Well of Lost Plots, the Text Sea is the source of all text for all books, and is the general burial ground for all destroyed characters to be once more reduced to text. Composed of a random jumble of words and punctuation, words are &quot;trawled&quot; for using scrawltrawlers, the equivalent of large fishing boats that capture words.

===Communication===
Mass communication in the BookWorld is provided by footnoterphones and mobilefootnoterphones. Messages from others appear as footnotes in the text, the &quot;number&quot; of a footnoterphone being the chosen character&#x27;s book, chapter, page number, paragraph, and line in a book. Connection between phones is created by hidden tunnel conduits that are invisible in the book, such tunnels spanning distances between other books and other genres. Connections can be crossed and filtered out using &quot;textual sieves&quot;, which filter out all incoming text. Junkfootnoterphones are the &quot;spam&quot; messages of BookWorld, frequently appearing in the Well of Lost Plots. News is also put over footnoterphones, which can be turned on and off at will.

Newspapers are the second choice for receiving news in BookWorld. The primary newspaper in the BookWorld is called &quot;The Word&quot;. Specific newsletters, such as &quot;Moveable Type&quot;, the official newsletter of Jurisfiction, may apply to certain groups of characters.

===Transportation===
While bookjumping appears to be a given talent to all fictional characters, the bookjumping ability is a rarity in those from outside BookWorld. Bookjumping involves &quot;reading&quot; yourself into a book, appearing in the storyline at the point read. Such natural talent or ability may be approved in some manner by teaching &quot;quality&quot; bookjumping, and bookjumping may be possible without reading the text aloud. In order to avoid potentially destroying a book&#x27;s plot, however, one must be careful to avoid jumping directly into an area where the plot is occurring, although most bookjumps send the jumper to a place directly outside of the narrative area. A bookjump is characterized by a &quot;fade out&quot; of the character bookjumping.

If a character cannot or does not wish to bookjump, they will have to utilize a method of private transportation. The only such transportation known is that of TransGenre Taxis, a bookjumping taxi service that may be used for a monetary fee.

Most unorganized crime takes place in the Well of Lost Plots, due to its lack of crime control in that area. Such common crime includes illegal selling of plot devices, characters, and others.

Due to the frequent instability of much of the BookWorld, a public police agency, instated by the Council of Genres (See &quot;Government&quot;), uses bookjumping and other devices to keep the BookWorld under control. The central and only crime-preventing force, Jurisfiction has jurisdiction over nearly all areas of the BookWorld. Once having volunteered for Jurisfiction, the applicant then becomes an apprentice to a chosen Jurisfiction agent. All agents are given an essential TravelBook, a necessary item for all situations. Containing needed Jursifiction devices and a link back to the Great Library as well as other popular works of fiction, the TravelBook also acts as a guide to the BookWorld and is password protected to each individual member. Agents deemed appropriate are also given the password to an unpublished work that acts as a bestiary and a research faculty for BookWorld creatures. (See &quot;Creatures&quot;.) Upon passing a written exam and practical exam, an apprentice is given full agent status.

===Government===
While Jurisfiction is given a large amount of power in the BookWorld, the primary legislative government is the Council of Genres, made up of a representative from every genre in the BookWorld. Ruling upon various issues and creating ordinances to counteract them, there is no official executive of the Council of Genres. Concerning judiciary matters, the Council has no control. Courtroom scenes across the BookWorld are used for this purpose, the judge and jury of each scene presiding over the case at hand.

===Creatures===
Adjective-creating creatures and maggot-like in appearance, bookworms act as portable thesauri, changing common adjectives into others (for example &quot;nice&quot; into &quot;amiable&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot;). Their presence is welcome in most areas, however, should too many infest one area, the area uses too many adjectives and &quot;flowery language&quot;, making the text unreadable.

A variety of species occurring, the grammasite was a failed attempt to change nouns into verbs. Escaping from the experiment, their release resulted in a disaster, as they can contribute severe damage to a book. The known types of grammasites include adjectivores, which suck all description from an object, and verbisoids, as well as others. Verbisoids can be beaten by irregular verbs.

===Languages===
Although the actual language of the BookWorld is English, there are also other Great Libraries that are apparently completely other languages. The actual sublanguages of each BookWorld, however, are regarded as fonts. Thus (according to Bradshaw&#x27;s BookWorld Companion), &quot;Courier Bold is the traditional language of those in the support industries such as within the Well of Lost Plots, and Lorem Ipsum is the gutter slang of the underworld—useful to have a few phrases in case you get into trouble in Horror or Noir.&quot;

(Lorem ipsum is a dummy text used to demonstrate layout. It is the only language Friday Next speaks as a young child.)

===Real-world allusions===
On his website Fforde reports that the Swindon Town Planning office, due to expansion and the need to name new streets, asked him if he would mind them using names of characters from his books. While Fforde seems to have written the page with his tongue in his cheek several new streets in the Orchid Vale area of Swindon have the names of literary characters that appear in the Thursday Next series. These include Thursday Street, Friday Street, Mycroft Road, Havisham Drive, Estella Close, Eyre Close, Braxton Road and Bradshaw Court.

<doc id="1117957" wikidata="Q1535333" url="?curid=1117957" title="Marmolejo">
<text>Volcán Marmolejo is a high Pleistocene stratovolcano in the Andes on the border between Argentina and Chile. It is located NNE of the active San José volcano, and is the southernmost -plus peak in the world. The Argentine portion is within the Argentinean protection area of Provincial Reserve for Multiple Use and Natural Recreation Manzano / Portillo de Piuquenes. It is on the border of two provinces: Argentinean province of Mendoza and Chilean province of Cordillera. Its slopes are within the administrative boundaries of the two cities: Argentinean city of Tunuyán and the Chilean commune of San José de Maipo.

== First ascent ==
Marmolejo was first climbed by Hermann Sattler, Sebastian Krückel and Albrecht Maass (Germany) October 1, 1928.

== Elevation ==
It has an official height of 6108 meters. Other data from available digital elevation models: SRTM yields 6097 metres, ASTER 6103 metres, ALOS 6085 metres and TanDEM-X 6129 metres. The height of the nearest key col is 4005 meters, leading to a topographic prominence of 2103 meters. Marmolejo is considered a Mountain Range according to the &quot;Dominance System&quot; and its dominance is 34.43%. Its parent peak is Tupungato and the Topographic isolation is 42.9 kilometers.

<doc id="1117969" wikidata="Q144075" url="?curid=1117969" title="Dental technician">
<text>A dental technician is a member of the dental team who, upon prescription from a dental clinician, constructs custom-made restorative and dental appliances.

There are four major disciplines within dental technology. These are &quot;fixed prosthesis&quot; including crowns, bridges and implants; &quot;removable prosthesis&quot;, including dentures and removable partial dentures; &quot;maxillofacial prosthesis&quot;, including ocular prosthesis and craniofacial prosthesis; and &quot;orthodontics and auxiliaries&quot;, including orthodontic appliances and mouthguards.

The dentist communicates with the dental technician with prescriptions, drawings, and measurements taken from the patient. The most important aspect of this is a dental impression into which the technician flows a gypsum dental stone to create a replica of the patient&#x27;s anatomy known as a dental cast. A technician can then use this cast for the construction of custom appliances.

==Fixed restorations==
A fixed dental restoration is an appliance designed to replace a tooth or teeth that may have been lost or damaged by injury, caries or other oral diseases. These restorations are distinguished from other restorations by the fact that once they have been placed by a dentist the patient can not remove them.
Such restorations include crowns, bridges, veneers, fixed implant restorations, pivot teeth, inlays and onlays.

==Removable restorations==
Removable restorations are dental appliances to replace one or more teeth that have been completely lost. These restorations ideally remain stable in normal function but can be removed by the patient for cleaning and at night. Removable restorations are either retained by the patients soft tissue as in full dentures, anchored and stabilized by other teeth as with partial dentures and overdentures or on implant attachments as with implant-retained overdentures and partial dentures.

==Orthodontics==
Orthodontic technicians make removable orthodontic appliances with wires, springs, and screws on prescription from an orthodontist to either move teeth to form a more harmonious occlusion and aesthetic appearance of teeth or to maintain the position of previously moved teeth.

== Specialization ==
Training to become a dental technician requires a combination of academic study as well as experience gained from working on the job. Therefore, regardless of the country that they are from, after becoming a qualified technician (so long as the title of “dental technician” exists there) one has finished their studies, but not their training since these crafts take years of experience to master.

Depending on the position held by the dental technician, their specific title could differ as well (“ceramicist”, “polisher”, “orthodontist”, etc.). In fact, due to the complexity of the work that is carried out by dental technicians, a professional generally specializes in one field of dental prosthesis. Since the range of devices to design and create is extremely varied, it would be impossible to make all of them with the same set of skills, further, to completely master any technique may require years of experience.

In general, the first step a dental technician makes is to “master the plaster”, meaning that they first start in the part of the lab where dental impressions are made, cutting models, and mounting articulators. The dental technician may acquire the ability to carry out various and disparate tasks in the lab, being able to even execute most steps in the production of various prosthetics, such as removable partial dentures, complete and partially made of resin, and orthodontic devices (including braces and retainers). Nevertheless, as mentioned previously, dental technicians need to specialize; in fact, there are many specific dental labs that exist for each and every type of prosthesis.

The distinct specialties are described below:

=== Polisher ===
A polisher is a dental technician who dedicates themselves to the setup of teeth, either in making removable prosthetics made of resin or metal, molding the neck of the tooth, or loading the resin. Within their profession, they can also be referred to as a waxer.

=== Metalworker ===
A metalworker is a dental technician who is in charge of casting dental rods, which means they mold the metal and obtain the metallic frames for fixed prostheses, similar to the removable prosthetics made of resin. They are also in charge of processing and reworking said metal. These professionals can also be in charge of designing the wax patterns of removable metallic prostheses, such as the copings of crowns and fixed bridges. Among other things, this depends on the dental technician and the lab in which they work.

=== Prosthetic orthodontists ===
It is very common to differentiate a prosthetist who works with removable orthodontics, as it is normal to find professionals who specialize in this field. Removable equipment consists of a variety of different devices, each with specific naming and characteristics. Prosthetic orthodontists should be both agile and precise when handling different pliers and manipulating wires.

=== Ceramicist ===
A ceramicist is a dental physician who has specialized in the final stage of making fixed prosthetics, which consists of the assembly of ceramic on different prosthetic structures such as: bridges, crowns, prosthetic implants or prosthetic attachments. This technique is complex and requires artistic talent, so much so that dental technicians can achieve different levels of ability, developing their creativity to a greater or lesser extent to give your teeth the most natural look possible. As such, ceramicists are often considered valued professionals.

== Products ==
Dental technicians predominantly make dentures, or similarly, create artificial parts that are intended to basically replace the natural, missing teeth of the patient.

Therefore, dental technicians make complete resin prosthetics (commonly called &quot;dentures&quot;), partial prosthetics (being metallic or made of resin), bridges and crowns of any type (fixed prosthetics, also called dental implants), and mixed prosthetic devices. Further, dental technicians also make all removable orthodontic devices (removable orthodontics), dental splints, individual compression trays, temporary resin prosthetics, bite plates, as well as study models. Dental technicians are also in charge of making composites (the repairing of prosthetics in case they break) and relining (the readjustment of prosthetics when they are too big or become flimsy in the mouth due to the reabsorption of alveolar bone over time). All of these, concerning the plaster models or instructor models, being a crime that acts on the patient&#x27;s mouth.

In every country that legally regulates the profession of dental technicians, the prosthetist is the only professional trained and authorized by law to make the previously mentioned products.

By law, dental technicians can never, even if there is a medical prescription, take impressions- the client of the prosthetists is legally the dentist, and it is considered an intrusive crime by the Penal Code if a prosthetist touches the mouth of the patient.

== Objectives ==
The goal of a dental technician can be summarized as restoring functionality, health, and aesthetic of the mouth.

The only goal of a prosthetist is not just to create a prosthetic, but rather to restore the loss of functionality of a patient&#x27;s mouth, from mastication and swallowing to speaking and correct phonetics. Through the work of a prosthetist, a patient&#x27;s oral health, mechanical function, hygiene, and comfort are revamped, including the aesthetic of the mouth and face.

This objective is a combined effort between clinical and lab members, an effort that is, in part, coordinated and achieved by the dentist and the prosthetist. That said, the only one in charge of the creation of prosthetics is the prosthetist, being a handcrafted, personalized, unique item designed in the dental lab.

<doc id="1117970" wikidata="Q5297072" url="?curid=1117970" title="Doom painting">
<text>A &quot;Doom painting&quot; or &quot;Doom&quot; is a traditional English term for a wall-painting of the Last Judgement in a medieval church. This is the moment in Christian eschatology when Christ judges souls to send them to either Heaven or Hell. 

&quot;Doom painting&quot; typically refers to large-scale depictions of the Last Judgement on the western wall of churches, visible to congregants as they left, rather than to representations in other locations or media. Many examples survive as wall-paintings in medieval churches, most dating from around the 12th to 13th centuries, although the subject was common from the 1st millennium until (in countries remaining Catholic) the Counter-Reformation. Most dooms in English churches were destroyed by government authority during the English Reformation.

The most famous of all Doom paintings, &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, painted in 1537 to 1541, comes at the end of the tradition, and is unusually sited on the east wall behind the altar.

==The term &quot;Doom&quot;==
Doom or &quot;the Doom&quot; was a specific term for the Last Judgement and first cited to c. 1200 by the OED (&quot;doom&quot;, 6), a sense surviving in this artistic meaning and in phrases such as the &quot;crack of doom&quot; and the word &quot;doomsday&quot;, the latter going back to Old English. The original OED in the late 19th century already described this sense of &quot;doom&quot; as &quot;archaic&quot;, but it remains in use in descriptions of (mostly) British medieval churches. 

==Purpose and iconography==
Dooms were encouraged by the early medieval Church as an instrument to highlight the contrasts between the reward of Heaven and the agony of Hell so as to guide Christians away from misbehaviour and sin. A Doom was usually positioned either on the rear (liturgical Western) wall, if that space was available, or at the front (chancel end) of a church, often on the chancel arch itself so that it would be constantly visible to worshippers as they faced the altar during services.

Although there are many different versions, the composition stays broadly the same. On the left side of a Doom painting (that is, on Christ&#x27;s right hand) is Heaven, whilst on the right (Christ&#x27;s left) is Hell. At the top of the image Jesus Christ sits in glory with his right hand encouraging the saved upward, and his left hand pointing down to Hell for the damned. Typically flanking him is the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Apostle on his left, sometimes with the twenty-four elders mentioned in the Book of Revelation encircling the three of them. The angels blow trumpets to raise the dead for judgement. Commonly the Archangel Michael is in the centre, with the scales he will use to weigh the souls of humanity to see if individually they are fit for Heaven: one person is on one side of the scale while demonic creatures that represent the sins committed by the person are on the other side of the scale. The creatures try to tip the scales in their favour while, in some versions of the painting, the Virgin Mary places a rosary next to the person she wishes to protect, or puts her hand on the scale to counterbalance the demons. In some other versions, while one of the saved enters Heaven, a demon tries to pull them in with the damned, while an angel fights the demon for the soul.

Those who are worthy are brought to the gates of Heaven, frequently represented by a castle with large walls built to keep out sinful impurities. This is most commonly depicted on the left hand side of Doom paintings. Groups of angels adorn the walls of Heaven celebrating the saved as they approach Heaven&#x27;s gates, where Saint Peter waits with his keys.

Those on the other side are deemed unworthy of Heaven, usually seized by demons and brought into the Hellmouth, beyond which, mostly out of sight, lie the bowels of hell.

A decisive factor in the Doom or Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal works of mercy were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.

At Chaldon in Surrey the west wall of the church has a painting of the Ladder of Salvation (a subject common in the Eastern Church but this is the only example in England). This painting dates from about 1200 and is 17.5 ft long and 11.21 ft high. It is in the church of Saints Peter and Paul, Chaldon (built before 1086 AD), and depicts images of the ways of salvation and damnation and their result.

<text>Chauncey Allen Goodrich (October 23, 1790 – February 25, 1860) was an American clergyman, educator and lexicographer. He was the son-in-law of Noah Webster and edited his &quot;Dictionary&quot; after his father-in-law&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Goodrich was the son of Elizur and Anne Willard (Allen) Goodrich. His father was a lawyer and member of the United States House of Representatives. He was also the grandson of the Reverend Elizur Goodrich. His uncle, also named Chauncey Goodrich, was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and a U.S. senator from Connecticut.

==Biography==

Chauncey Allen Goodrich graduated from Yale in 1810, served as tutor there in 1812–1814, and afterward studied theology. He settled in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1810 as pastor of the Congregational church there, but feeble health obliged him to leave in 1817. In 1820 he was chosen president of Williams College, but declined the office. He was professor of rhetoric and oratory in Yale from 1817 until 1839 when he was transferred to the chair of pastoral theology in that institution, which chair he held till his death.

Dr. Goodrich exerted a wide influence, and co-operated with many learned societies. As a teacher he inspired his pupils to the highest effort. He was a liberal benefactor of the Yale Divinity School. The degree of D.D. was conferred on him by Brown University in 1835. Dr. Goodrich made numerous contributions to periodical literature, and in 1829 established the &quot;Christian Quarterly Spectator&quot;, with which he was connected nearly ten years, being its sole editor after 1830. While a tutor at Yale, Dr. Goodrich published a Greek grammar (1814) based on the grammar by C.F. Hachenberg, and in 1830, at the request of President Timothy Dwight, he prepared a textbook, &quot;Greek and Latin Lessons&quot; (1832), which was extensively used in New England.

Soon after the publication of the &quot;American Dictionary&quot;, by his father-in-law, Noah Webster (1828), Dr. Goodrich was entrusted by its author with power to superintend an abridgment of the work, which he did, conforming the orthography more nearly to the common standard. This edition, in the preparation of which he was assisted by Benjamin Silliman, Denison Olmsted, and others, was issued in 1847, and the “Universal” edition of the same work appeared in 1856. In 1859 the supplement was issued, to which comprehensive additions were made. At the time of his death Dr. Goodrich was engaged on a radical revision of the dictionary, but he died before the work received its final form, and it was published under the supervision of Noah Porter (1864). He was also engaged in preparing a new edition of the Bible, with English text, as one of the American Bible society&#x27;s “committee on versions.” Dr. Goodrich was also the author of &quot;Select British Eloquence&quot; (1852). A commemorative discourse by President Theodore D. Woolsey has been published as a pamphlet (New Haven, 1860).

Goodrich Street, a principal thoroughfare linking Prospect Street and Dixwell Avenue along the division between northern New Haven and southern Hamden in Connecticut, is named for him.

The club was first founded on 8 April 1906 but it was disbanded again in 1915 due to problems with where they were allowed to play. On 30 March 1921, 30 young people from the football department of Lyngby IF decided to break away and start their own club. They named it Lyngby Boldklub af 1921. For the first few years, they played at Lundtofte Flyveplads, using the flight hangars as locker rooms. In 1949 the club moved to the area where the present-day Lyngby Stadion is located.

Lyngby was the first club in Denmark to wear the club&#x27;s name on the kits, which happened in 1961. In 1983 the club became Danish champions for the first time and in 1984 the club played in the European Cup losing to Sparta Prague with 1–2,0–0 in the second round after beating KS Elbasani in the first round with 3–0,3–0. In 1986 the club was the first one to win its group in the UEFA Intertoto Cup without loss of points.

The club won its second Danish championship in 1992 on Gentofte Stadion. In 1996 the club was eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Club Brügge, even though playing a 1–1 draw in Belgium. 1996 was also the year when Lyngby&#x27;s chairmen, Flemming Østergaard and Michael Kjær sold team captain Larsen to FC Copenhagen. The sale sparked harsh protests among the fans. In 1997 Østergaard and Kjær left Lyngby to become chairmen in FC Copenhagen. They were joined by striker Jónsson.

In December 2001 the club went bankrupt and was forced to finish the season using only amateur players. Hardly surprising, the team finished the season in last place and was subsequently relegated an additional two leagues due to the bankruptcy. As a result, the team went straight from playing in the Superliga to playing in the amateur league Danmarksserien, just below the three Danish pro leagues. In 2003 the team was promoted to the 2nd Division (the third best league), as winner of Danmarksserien, and on 18 June 2005 the team gained promotion to the 1st Division by finishing 3rd in the 2nd Division.

In the 2006–07 season the team won the Danish 1st Division thus returning to the top flight only five and a half seasons after going bankrupt. Another highlight of the 2006–07 season occurred on 12 April 2007 as Lyngby advanced to the semi-finals of the Danish Cup for the first time in several years, by winning 1–0 against AC Horsens on Lyngby Stadion.

Lyngby achieved a third place in the 2016-17 season, just a season after being promoted from the 1. Division. In the second half of the 2017-18 season, however, the club experienced financial difficulties, due to irregularities at the club owner, Hellerup Finans, which later went bankrupt. This led to the departure of several key players, before, on 9 February 2018, the club was bought and saved by a group of local business people and fans known collectively as Friends of Lyngby. This was not enough for Lyngby to hold its place in the Superliga, as the club lost two play-off matches against 1. Division number 3, Vendsyssel FF, being relegated to 1. Division. Just over a year later, on 2 June 2019, fortunes were reversed, as Lyngby, finishing 3rd in 1. Division, won 3–2 on aggregate against Vendsyssel FF, securing its re-promotion to the top flight.

On May 28, 2024, it was announced that Philadelphia based Union Sports and Entertainment had entered into a strategic partnership with Lyngby Boldklub, also acquiring a minority stake in the club.

<doc id="1117979" wikidata="Q719461" url="?curid=1117979" title="VSEPR theory">
<text>Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory ( , ) is a model used in chemistry to predict the geometry of individual molecules from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms. It is also named the Gillespie-Nyholm theory after its two main developers, Ronald Gillespie and Ronald Nyholm.

The premise of VSEPR is that the valence electron pairs surrounding an atom tend to repel each other. The greater the repulsion, the higher in energy (less stable) the molecule is. Therefore, the VSEPR-predicted molecular geometry of a molecule is the one that has as little of this repulsion as possible. Gillespie has emphasized that the electron-electron repulsion due to the Pauli exclusion principle is more important in determining molecular geometry than the electrostatic repulsion.

The insights of VSEPR theory are derived from topological analysis of the electron density of molecules. Such quantum chemical topology (QCT) methods include the electron localization function (ELF) and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (AIM or QTAIM).

==History==
The idea of a correlation between molecular geometry and number of valence electron pairs (both shared and unshared pairs) was originally proposed in 1939 by Ryutaro Tsuchida in Japan, and was independently presented in a Bakerian Lecture in 1940 by Nevil Sidgwick and Herbert Powell of the University of Oxford. In 1957, Ronald Gillespie and Ronald Sydney Nyholm of University College London refined this concept into a more detailed theory, capable of choosing between various alternative geometries.

==Overview==
VSEPR theory is used to predict the arrangement of electron pairs around central atoms in molecules, especially simple and symmetric molecules. A central atom is defined in this theory as an atom which is bonded to two or more other atoms, while a terminal atom is bonded to only one other atom. For example in the molecule methyl isocyanate (H3C-N=C=O), the two carbons and one nitrogen are central atoms, and the three hydrogens and one oxygen are terminal atoms. The geometry of the central atoms and their non-bonding electron pairs in turn determine the geometry of the larger whole molecule.

The number of electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom is determined after drawing the Lewis structure of the molecule, and expanding it to show all bonding groups and lone pairs of electrons. In VSEPR theory, a double bond or triple bond is treated as a single bonding group. The sum of the number of atoms bonded to a central atom and the number of lone pairs formed by its nonbonding valence electrons is known as the central atom&#x27;s steric number.

The electron pairs (or groups if multiple bonds are present) are assumed to lie on the surface of a sphere centered on the central atom and tend to occupy positions that minimize their mutual repulsions by maximizing the distance between them. The number of electron pairs (or groups), therefore, determines the overall geometry that they will adopt. For example, when there are two electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their mutual repulsion is minimal when they lie at opposite poles of the sphere. Therefore, the central atom is predicted to adopt a &quot;linear&quot; geometry. If there are 3 electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their repulsion is minimized by placing them at the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered on the atom. Therefore, the predicted geometry is &quot;trigonal&quot;. Likewise, for 4 electron pairs, the optimal arrangement is &quot;tetrahedral&quot;.

As a tool in predicting the geometry adopted with a given number of electron pairs, an often used physical demonstration of the principle of minimal electron pair repulsion utilizes inflated balloons. Through handling, balloons acquire a slight surface electrostatic charge that results in the adoption of roughly the same geometries when they are tied together at their stems as the corresponding number of electron pairs. For example, five balloons tied together adopt the &quot;trigonal bipyramidal&quot; geometry, just as do the five bonding pairs of a PCl5 molecule.

===Steric number===

The steric number of a central atom in a molecule is the number of atoms bonded to that central atom, called its coordination number, plus the number of lone pairs of valence electrons on the central atom. In the molecule SF4, for example, the central sulfur atom has four ligands; the coordination number of sulfur is four. In addition to the four ligands, sulfur also has one lone pair in this molecule. Thus, the steric number is 4 + 1 = 5.

===Degree of repulsion===
The overall geometry is further refined by distinguishing between &quot;bonding&quot; and &quot;nonbonding&quot; electron pairs. The bonding electron pair shared in a sigma bond with an adjacent atom lies further from the central atom than a nonbonding (lone) pair of that atom, which is held close to its positively charged nucleus. VSEPR theory therefore views repulsion by the lone pair to be greater than the repulsion by a bonding pair. As such, when a molecule has 2 interactions with different degrees of repulsion, VSEPR theory predicts the structure where lone pairs occupy positions that allow them to experience less repulsion. Lone pair–lone pair (lp–lp) repulsions are considered stronger than lone pair–bonding pair (lp–bp) repulsions, which in turn are considered stronger than bonding pair–bonding pair (bp–bp) repulsions, distinctions that then guide decisions about overall geometry when 2 or more non-equivalent positions are possible. For instance, when 5 valence electron pairs surround a central atom, they adopt a &quot;trigonal bipyramidal&quot; molecular geometry with two collinear &quot;axial&quot; positions and three &quot;equatorial&quot; positions. An electron pair in an axial position has three close equatorial neighbors only 90° away and a fourth much farther at 180°, while an equatorial electron pair has only two adjacent pairs at 90° and two at 120°. The repulsion from the close neighbors at 90° is more important, so that the axial positions experience more repulsion than the equatorial positions; hence, when there are lone pairs, they tend to occupy equatorial positions as shown in the diagrams of the next section for steric number five.

The difference between lone pairs and bonding pairs may also be used to rationalize deviations from idealized geometries. For example, the H2O molecule has four electron pairs in its valence shell: two lone pairs and two bond pairs. The four electron pairs are spread so as to point roughly towards the apices of a tetrahedron. However, the bond angle between the two O–H bonds is only 104.5°, rather than the 109.5° of a regular tetrahedron, because the two lone pairs (whose density or probability envelopes lie closer to the oxygen nucleus) exert a greater mutual repulsion than the two bond pairs.

A bond of higher bond order also exerts greater repulsion since the pi bond electrons contribute. For example in isobutylene, (H3C)2C=CH2, the H3C−C=C angle (124°) is larger than the H3C−C−CH3 angle (111.5°). However, in the carbonate ion, , all three C−O bonds are equivalent with angles of 120° due to resonance.

==AXE method==
The &quot;AXE method&quot; of electron counting is commonly used when applying the VSEPR theory. The electron pairs around a central atom are represented by a formula AXmEn, where &quot;A&quot; represents the central atom and always has an implied subscript one. Each &quot;X&quot; represents a ligand (an atom bonded to A). Each &quot;E&quot; represents a &quot;lone pair&quot; of electrons on the central atom. The total number of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;E&quot; is known as the steric number. For example in a molecule AX3E2, the atom A has a steric number of 5.

When the substituent (X) atoms are not all the same, the geometry is still approximately valid, but the bond angles may be slightly different from the ones where all the outside atoms are the same. For example, the double-bond carbons in alkenes like C2H4 are AX3E0, but the bond angles are not all exactly 120°. Likewise, SOCl2 is AX3E1, but because the X substituents are not identical, the X–A–X angles are not all equal.

Based on the steric number and distribution of &quot;X&quot;s and &quot;E&quot;s, VSEPR theory makes the predictions in the following tables.

===Main-group elements===
For main-group elements, there are stereochemically active lone pairs &quot;E&quot; whose number can vary between 0 to 3. Note that the geometries are named according to the atomic positions only and not the electron arrangement. For example, the description of AX2E1 as a bent molecule means that the three atoms AX2 are not in one straight line, although the lone pair helps to determine the geometry.


===Transition metals (Kepert model)===
The lone pairs on transition metal atoms are usually stereochemically inactive, meaning that their presence does not change the molecular geometry. For example, the hexaaquo complexes M(H2O)6 are all octahedral for M = V3+, Mn3+, Co3+, Ni2+ and Zn2+, despite the fact that the electronic configurations of the central metal ion are d2, d4, d6, d8 and d10 respectively. The Kepert model ignores all lone pairs on transition metal atoms, so that the geometry around all such atoms corresponds to the VSEPR geometry for AXn with 0 lone pairs E. This is often written MLn, where M = metal and L = ligand. The Kepert model predicts the following geometries for coordination numbers of 2 through 9:

==Examples==
The methane molecule (CH4) is tetrahedral because there are four pairs of electrons. The four hydrogen atoms are positioned at the vertices of a tetrahedron, and the bond angle is cos−1(−) ≈ 109° 28′. This is referred to as an AX4 type of molecule. As mentioned above, A represents the central atom and X represents an outer atom.

The ammonia molecule (NH3) has three pairs of electrons involved in bonding, but there is a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. It is not bonded with another atom; however, it influences the overall shape through repulsions. As in methane above, there are four regions of electron density. Therefore, the overall orientation of the regions of electron density is tetrahedral. On the other hand, there are only three outer atoms. This is referred to as an AX3E type molecule because the lone pair is represented by an E. By definition, the molecular shape or geometry describes the geometric arrangement of the atomic nuclei only, which is trigonal-pyramidal for NH3.

Steric numbers of 7 or greater are possible, but are less common. The steric number of 7 occurs in iodine heptafluoride (IF7); the base geometry for a steric number of 7 is pentagonal bipyramidal. The most common geometry for a steric number of 8 is a square antiprismatic geometry. Examples of this include the octacyanomolybdate () and octafluorozirconate () anions. The nonahydridorhenate ion () in potassium nonahydridorhenate is a rare example of a compound with a steric number of 9, which has a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.

Steric numbers beyond 9 are very rare, and it is not clear what geometry is generally favoured. Possible geometries for steric numbers of 10, 11, 12, or 14 are bicapped square antiprismatic (or bicapped dodecadeltahedral), octadecahedral, icosahedral, and bicapped hexagonal antiprismatic, respectively. No compounds with steric numbers this high involving monodentate ligands exist, and those involving multidentate ligands can often be analysed more simply as complexes with lower steric numbers when some multidentate ligands are treated as a unit.

==Exceptions==
There are groups of compounds where VSEPR fails to predict the correct geometry.

===Some AX2E0 molecules===

The shapes of heavier Group 14 element alkyne analogues (RM≡MR, where M = Si, Ge, Sn or Pb) have been computed to be bent.

===Some AX2E2 molecules===
One example of the AX2E2 geometry is molecular lithium oxide, Li2O, a linear rather than bent structure, which is ascribed to its bonds being essentially ionic and the strong lithium-lithium repulsion that results. Another example is O(SiH3)2 with an Si–O–Si angle of 144.1°, which compares to the angles in Cl2O (110.9°), (CH3)2O (111.7°), and N(CH3)3 (110.9°). Gillespie and Robinson rationalize the Si–O–Si bond angle based on the observed ability of a ligand&#x27;s lone pair to most greatly repel other electron pairs when the ligand electronegativity is greater than or equal to that of the central atom. In O(SiH3)2, the central atom is more electronegative, and the lone pairs are less localized and more weakly repulsive. The larger Si–O–Si bond angle results from this and strong ligand-ligand repulsion by the relatively large -SiH3 ligand. Burford et al showed through X-ray diffraction studies that Cl3Al–O–PCl3 has a linear Al–O–P bond angle and is therefore a non-VSEPR molecule.

===Some AX6E1 and AX8E1 molecules===

Some AX6E1 molecules, e.g. xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) and the Te(IV) and Bi(III) anions, , , , and , are octahedral, rather than pentagonal pyramids, and the lone pair does not affect the geometry to the degree predicted by VSEPR. Similarly, the octafluoroxenate ion () in nitrosonium octafluoroxenate(VI) is a square antiprism with minimal distortion, despite having a lone pair. One rationalization is that steric crowding of the ligands allows little or no room for the non-bonding lone pair; another rationalization is the inert-pair effect.

===Square planar ML4 complexes===
The Kepert model predicts that ML4 transition metal molecules are tetrahedral in shape, and it cannot explain the formation of square planar complexes. The majority of such complexes exhibit a d8 configuration as for the tetrachloroplatinate () ion. The explanation of the shape of square planar complexes involves electronic effects and requires the use of crystal field theory.

===Complexes with strong d-contribution===

Some transition metal complexes with low d electron count have unusual geometries, which can be ascribed to d subshell bonding interaction. Gillespie found that this interaction produces bonding pairs that also occupy the respective antipodal points (ligand opposed) of the sphere. This phenomenon is an electronic effect resulting from the bilobed shape of the underlying sdx hybrid orbitals. The repulsion of these bonding pairs leads to a different set of shapes.

The gas phase structures of the triatomic halides of the heavier members of group 2, (i.e., calcium, strontium and barium halides, MX2), are not linear as predicted but are bent, (approximate X–M–X angles: CaF2, 145°; SrF2, 120°; BaF2, 108°; SrCl2, 130°; BaCl2, 115°; BaBr2, 115°; BaI2, 105°). It has been proposed by Gillespie that this is also caused by bonding interaction of the ligands with the d subshell of the metal atom, thus influencing the molecular geometry.

===Superheavy elements===
Relativistic effects on the electron orbitals of superheavy elements is predicted to influence the molecular geometry of some compounds. For instance, the 6d5/2 electrons in nihonium play an unexpectedly strong role in bonding, so NhF3 should assume a T-shaped geometry, instead of a trigonal planar geometry like its lighter congener BF3. In contrast, the extra stability of the 7p1/2 electrons in tennessine are predicted to make TsF3 trigonal planar, unlike the T-shaped geometry observed for IF3 and predicted for AtF3; similarly, OgF4 should have a tetrahedral geometry, while XeF4 has a square planar geometry and RnF4 is predicted to have the same.

==Odd-electron molecules==
The VSEPR theory can be extended to molecules with an odd number of electrons by treating the unpaired electron as a &quot;half electron pair&quot;—for example, Gillespie and Nyholm suggested that the decrease in the bond angle in the series  (180°), NO2 (134°),  (115°) indicates that a given set of bonding electron pairs exert a weaker repulsion on a single non-bonding electron than on a pair of non-bonding electrons. In effect, they considered nitrogen dioxide as an AX2E0.5 molecule, with a geometry intermediate between and . Similarly, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an AX2E1.5 molecule, with a geometry intermediate between  and .

Finally, the methyl radical (CH3) is predicted to be trigonal pyramidal like the methyl anion (), but with a larger bond angle (as in the trigonal planar methyl cation ()). However, in this case, the VSEPR prediction is not quite true, as CH3 is actually planar, although its distortion to a pyramidal geometry requires very little energy.

<text>IP aliasing is associating more than one IP address to a network interface. With this, one node on a network can have multiple connections to a network, each serving a different purpose.

According to the Linux Kernel documentation, 

In the Linux kernel, it was first implemented by Juan José Ciarlante in 1995. On Solaris IP aliasing was called logical network interface and was first available in Solaris 2.5 in 1995. It has also been possible in Microsoft Windows NT since (at least) Windows NT 3.51, released in 1995.

IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. This demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example you could have one server that is acting as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server and DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or indeed the opposite you could decide to replace the three different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration overhead. In this case you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical network interfaces. Another reason to use IP aliasing could be to have the computer on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single physical interface.

<doc id="1117992" wikidata="Q3512547" url="?curid=1117992" title="Dental porcelain">
<text>Dental [[porcelain]] (also known as dental ceramic) is a dental material used by dental technicians to create biocompatible lifelike dental restorations, such as crowns, bridges, and veneers. Evidence suggests they are an effective material as they are biocompatible, aesthetic, insoluble and have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale. For certain dental prostheses, such as three-unit molars porcelain fused to metal or in complete porcelain group, zirconia-based restorations are recommended.

The word &quot;ceramic&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;keramos&quot;, meaning &quot;potter&#x27;s clay&quot;. It came from the ancient art of fabricating pottery where mostly clay was fired to form a hard, brittle object; a more modern definition is a material that contains metallic and non-metallic elements (usually oxygen). These materials can be defined by their inherent properties including their hard, stiff, and brittle nature due to the structure of their inter-atomic bonding, which is both ionic and covalent. In contrast, metals are non-brittle (display elastic behavior), and ductile (display plastic behaviour) due to the nature of their inter-atomic metallic bond. These bonds are defined by a cloud of shared electrons with the ability to move easily when energy is applied. Ceramics can vary in opacity from very translucent to very opaque. In general, the more glassy the microstructure (i.e. noncrystalline) the more translucent it will appear, and the more crystalline, the more opaque.

== Composition ==
Ceramic used in dental application differs in composition from conventional ceramic to achieve optimum aesthetic components such as translucency.

As example the composition of dental feldspathic porcelain is as follows:
* Kaolin 3-5%
* Quartz (silica) 12-25%
* Feldspar 70-85%
* Metallic colourants 1%
* Glass up to 15%

== Classification ==
Ceramics can be classified based on the following:
=== Classification by Microstructure ===
At the microstructural level, ceramics can be defined by the nature of their composition of amorphous-to-crystalline ratio. There can be an infinite variability of the microstructures of materials, but they can be broken down into four basic compositional categories, with a few subgroups:
* Composition category 1 – glass-based systems (mainly silica), example is the feldspathic porcelain.
* Composition category 2 – glass-based systems (mainly silica) with fillers, usually crystalline (typically leucite or, more recently, lithium disilicate)
* Composition category 3 – crystalline-based systems with glass fillers (mainly alumina) 
* Composition category 4 – polycrystalline solids (alumina and zirconia).

Dental ceramic is generally regarded as biologically inert. However, other toxicities may exist from depleted uranium as well as some of the other accessory materials; in addition, the restoration may increase wear on opposing teeth.

=== Classification by Processing Technique ===
* Powder/liquid, glass-based systems
* Machinable or pressable blocks of glass-based systems
* CAD/CAM or slurry, die-processed, mostly crystalline systems

=== Classification of crystalline ceramics ===
== Types of dental ceramics ==

The range of dental ceramics determined by their respective firing temperatures are:
* Ultra-low
Fired below 850 °C - mainly used for shoulder ceramics (aims to combat the problem of shrinkage, specifically at the margins of the prep, when the early sintered ceramic state is fired to produce the final restoration), to correct minor defects and to add colour/shading to restorations
* Low fusing 
Fired between 850 and 950 °C - to prevent the occurrence of distortion, this type of ceramic should not be subjected to multiple firings
* Higher fusing
This type is used mainly for denture teeth

==Laboratory procedure==
The dentist will usually specify a shade or combination of shades for different parts of the restoration, which in turn corresponds to a set of samples containing the porcelain powder. There are two types of porcelain restorations:

* Porcelain fused to metal 
* Complete porcelain 
Ceramic restorations can be built on a refractory die, which is a reproduction of a prepared tooth made of a strong material with the ability to withstand high temperatures, or it can be constructed on a metal coping or core.

For ceramic fused to metal restorations, the black color of metal is first masked with an opaque layer giving it a shade of white before consecutive layers are built up. The powder corresponding to the desired shade of dentine base is mixed with water before it is fired. Further layers are built up to mimic the natural translucency of the enamel of the tooth. The porcelain is fused to a semi-precious metal or precious metal, such as gold, for extra strength.

Systems which use an aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide or zirconia core instead of metal, produces complete porcelain restorations.

=== Firing ===

Once the mass has been built up, it is fired to allow fusion of the ceramic particles which in turn forms the completed restoration; the process by which this is done is referred to as ‘firing’.

The first firing forces water out and allows the particles to coalesce. During this initial process, a large amount of shrinkage occurs until the mass reaches an almost void-free state; to overcome this the mass is built-up to a size larger than the final restoration will be.

The mass is then left to cool slowly to prevent cracking and reduced strength of the final restoration.

Adding more layers to build up the restoration to the desired shape and/or size requires the ceramic to undergo further rounds of firing.

=== Staining ===

Ceramic can also be stained to show tooth morphology such as occlusal fissures and hypoplastic spots. These stains can be incorporated within the ceramic or applied onto the surface.
=== Glazing ===

Glazing is required to produce a smooth surface and it&#x27;s the last stage of sealing the surface as it will fill porous areas and prevent wear on opposing teeth. Glazing can be achieved by re-firing the restoration, which fuses outer layers of the ceramic, or by using glazes with lower fusing temperatures; these are applied on the outer surface of the restoration in a thin layer. Any adjustments are then made with polishing rubbers and fine diamonds.

=== Use of CAD-CAM ===
Recent developments in CAD/CAM dentistry uses special partially sintered ceramic (zirconia), glass-bonded ceramic or glass-ceramic (lithium disilicate) formed into machinable blocks, which are fired again after machining.

By utilising in-office CAD/CAM technology, clinicians are able to design, fabricate and place all-ceramic inlays, onlays, crowns and veneers in a single patient visit. Ceramic restorations produced by this method have demonstrated excellent fit, strength and longevity. Two basic techniques can be used for CAD/CAM restorations:

* Chairside single-visit technique
* Integrated chairside–laboratory CAD/CAM procedure

== Ceramic restorations==
Ceramic restorations are indicated for most dental applications including:

* Veneers
* Inlays
* Onlays
* Crowns
* Bridges
* Implant supra- and sub-structures
* Denture teeth
However, each system will have its own set of specific indications and contraindications which can be obtained from the manufacturer&#x27;s guideline.

== Contraindications for ceramic restorations ==
Ceramic restorations are contraindicated when a patient presents with the following: 
* Parafunction; individuals who suffer from bruxism or clenching
* Short clinical crown
* Immature teeth
* Unfavourable occlusion
* Supragingival preparations (when used alongside adhesive cements)

== Other uses ==

=== Denture teeth ===
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is the material of choice for denture teeth, however ceramic denture teeth have been, and still are used for this purpose. The main benefit associated with the use of ceramic teeth is their superior wear resistance. There are however a number of disadvantages to using ceramic for denture teeth including their inability to form chemical bonds with the PMMA denture base; rather, ceramic teeth are attached to the base via mechanical retention which increases the chance of debonding during use over time. Additionally, they are more likely to fracture due to their brittle nature.

=== Endodontic posts ===
Ceramic can be used in the construction of non-metallic posts, however, it is a brittle material and as such may fracture within the root canal or may cause fracture of the root due to its increased strength. Another disadvantage is that once placed, removal may not be possible.

<doc id="1117997" wikidata="Q8049319" url="?curid=1117997" title="Yargo (novel)">
<text>Yargo is a romantic science fiction novel by Jacqueline Susann. It was written during the 1950s, but not published until 1979, four years after Susann&#x27;s death.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Yargo&quot; tells the story of Janet Cooper, a young woman from Avalon, New Jersey, who is abducted by aliens from the planet Yargo. During her interplanetary adventures with these intelligent but emotionless extraterrestrials, she falls in love with their leader.

==Background==
Jacqueline Susann had long been interested in science fiction; her widower, Irving Mansfield, said that when they first met, she wanted to spend their dates at the Hayden Planetarium instead of at nightclubs. In the early 1950s, she began to write &quot;Yargo&quot;, originally called &quot;The Stars Scream&quot;. She finished the book in 1956, and gave it to MCA agent George Chasin, who attempted to sell the story to Hollywood. Unsuccessful, he put the manuscript aside, where it was forgotten until Chasin reportedly was cleaning out a filing cabinet after Susann&#x27;s death. Irving Mansfield suggested Chasin send it to Bantam Books, Susann&#x27;s long-time paperback publisher; Bantam accepted it for publication, with a first printing of 1.3 million copies. The story also appeared in the February 1979 issue of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, which had enjoyed a huge success five years earlier when it published Susann&#x27;s original novella, &quot;Dolores&quot;. &quot;Yargo&quot; was published on February 28, 1979.

==Reception==
Critical notices were negative: one critic wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s awful, as usual, and it will sell, as usual.&quot; &quot;The Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Book Review&quot; stated that &quot;Yargo&quot; is &quot;mildly entertaining,&quot; but &quot;has no lasting value... except perhaps as a curiosity.&quot; &quot;Yargo&quot; was, nonetheless, a best seller, spending seven weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Mass Market Paperback list. The blog The Sleaze Factor, that celebrates trashy books, movies and pop culture, found &quot;Yargo&quot; &quot;Very delightful indeed.&quot; He continues, &quot;Contrary to what some may believe, &quot;Yargo&quot; is surprisingly effective. Of course you have to dig Jacqueline Susann to really get this one. We’re not talking about [fantasy and science fiction author] Alan Dean Foster here. &quot;Yargo&quot; is just a quick and satisfying—and yes, silly—read that will make anyone on the Susann band wagon smile and appreciate her range as a trashy novelist.&quot;

<doc id="1117998" wikidata="Q437303" url="?curid=1117998" title="Leopold VI, Duke of Austria">
<text>Leopold VI (15 October 1176 – 28 July 1230), known as Leopold the Glorious, was Duke of Styria from 1194 and Duke of Austria from 1198 to his death in 1230. He was a member of the House of Babenberg.

== Biography ==
Leopold VI was the younger son of Duke Leopold V and his wife, Helena of Hungary (daughter of Géza II of Hungary and Euphrosyne of Kiev). He was betrothed to the Damsel of Cyprus in 1193, but the marriage never took place.

In contravention of the provisions of the Georgenberg Pact, the Babenberg reign was divided after the death of Leopold V: Leopold VI&#x27;s elder brother, Frederick I, was given the Duchy of Austria (corresponding roughly to modern Lower Austria and eastern Upper Austria), while Leopold VI himself became Duke of Styria. The duchies were reunified under Leopold VI when Frederick died after only four years of rule.

Leopold VI participated in the Reconquista in Spain and in two crusades, the Albigensian Crusade in 1212 and the failed Fifth Crusade from 1217 to 1221, and—like his predecessors—attempted to develop the land by founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Lilienfeld in the Lower Austrian valley of the Traisen River, where he was buried after his death. Besides that, he supported the then highly modern mendicant Orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans. He elevated Enns to the status of a city in 1212, and Vienna in 1221, the territory of which was nearly doubled.

Under Leopold&#x27;s rule, the Gothic style began to reach Austria - the &quot;Cappella Speciosa&quot; in his temporary residence of Klosterneuburg is known as the first building influenced by it in the Danube area - a reconstruction of it can be seen today in the palace gardens of Laxenburg.

Leopold&#x27;s court is known as a center of the Minnesang, &quot;e.g&quot;., Walther von der Vogelweide, Neidhart von Reuental and Ulrich von Liechtenstein were active here. Also, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; may have been written in his court.

Babenbergian Austria reached the zenith of its prestige under Leopold&#x27;s rule. Evidence of this is given by his marriage to the Byzantine princess Theodora Angelina and his attempt to end the War of the Keys by mediating between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX. This is what he was working on when he died in 1230 at San Germano.

==Children==
Leopold and Theodora Angelina had:
# Margaret, Duchess of Austria (1204 – 29 October 1266), married Henry, the eldest son and heir presumptive of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, then after he died, married King Ottokar II of Bohemia.
# Agnes of Austria (19 February 1205 – 29 August 1226), married Albert I, Duke of Saxony
# Leopold of Austria (1207–1216) died when he climbed a tree and fell at Klosterneuburg
# Henry II, Duke of Mödling (1208 – 28 November 1228), married Agnes of Thuringia; their only daughter, Gertrudis, was the general heiress of the House of Babenberg after the death of her uncle
# Gertrude of Austria (1210–1241), married Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia
# Frederick II, Duke of Austria (25 April 1211 – 15 June 1246)
# Constantia of Austria (6 April 1212 – 5 June 1243), married Henry III, Margrave of Meissen

<text>Elizur Goodrich (March 24, 1761 – November 1, 1849) was an eighteenth-century American lawyer and politician from Connecticut. He served as a United States representative from Connecticut and Collector of Customs. He was also the brother of US Senator Chauncey Goodrich, son-in-law of Founding Father Oliver Wolcott.

==Biography==

Born in Durham in the Connecticut Colony, he was the son of Elizur Goodrich. He graduated from Yale College in 1779, was a tutor there from 1781 to 1783, and studied law. After his was admitted to the bar in 1783, he began the practice of law in New Haven. He served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1795 to 1802 and was its Clerk for six sessions and its Speaker for two.

In the 1796 United States presidential election he was a Federalist elector for president, supporting Federalist candidate John Adams against Democratic-Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson.

He was elected to represent Connecticut At-Large to the Sixth and Seventh Congresses, but only served in the Sixth Congress from March 4, 1799, to March 3, 1801 because President John Adams appointed him collector of customs for the Port of New Haven. After a short time he was removed from the office of collector by Adams&#x27; successor, President Thomas Jefferson. The discussion of this act elicited from Jefferson a letter in which he avowed his approval of removal for political opinions.

Goodrich was elected to the Governor&#x27;s Council in Connecticut in 1803, serving until 1818. He taught law at Yale from 1801 to 1810 and was probate judge from 1802 to 1818. From 1803 to 1822 he was also Mayor of New Haven. From 1803 to 1807, he also served as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors.

Goodrich was a member of the Yale Corporation, the university&#x27;s governing body, from 1809 to 1818 and was its Secretary from 1818 to 1846. Yale conferred the degree of LL.D. on him in 1830. Goodrich died in New Haven on November 1, 1849, and is interred in Grove Street Cemetery.

He was featured among the 1,700 Congressmen who are on the List of members of the US Congress who owned slaves at one point in American history.

==Personal life==
Goodrich&#x27;s son, Chauncey Allen Goodrich, married Noah Webster&#x27;s daughter. His brother, also named Chauncey Goodrich, was a member of the United States House of Representatives.

Goodrich&#x27;s wife, Annie Willard Allen Goodrich, was the sister of John Allen, a United States representative from Connecticut and a member of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors.

His sister-in-law, Mary Ann Wolcott Goodrich, through his brother Senator Chauncey Goodrich, was the daughter of the Signatory of the US Declaration of Independence, Oliver Wolcott, and sister of US Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott Jr..

<doc id="1118005" wikidata="Q53560" url="?curid=1118005" title="Tommy Haas">
<text>Thomas Mario Haas (; born 3 April 1978) is a German–American former professional tennis player. He competed on the ATP Tour from 1996 to 2017, and was ranked world No. 2 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in May 2002. Haas won 15 career titles in singles, including a Masters title at the 2001 Stuttgart Masters, and a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He reached the semifinals of the Australian Open three times, and in Wimbledon once. He reached the quarterfinal stage at each of the majors.

==Early life==
Born in Hamburg, Germany to Brigitte and Peter Haas, Tommy started playing his own version of tennis when he was four years old, using a wooden plank to hit balls against the wall or into his father&#x27;s hands. When his father observed his talents, he started bringing Haas to work, as he was a tennis coach.

At five, Haas won his first youth tournament, in Hamburg. At eight, he won his second, in Munich. Between 11 and 13, Haas twice won the Austrian Championship, the German Championship, and the European Championship.

Haas&#x27;s talents were noted by tennis guru Nick Bollettieri. He was so impressed by the young German&#x27;s talent that he offered Haas the chance to stay and train at his Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Florida, for free, and Haas began attending at age 11. At 13, speaking little English, Haas moved full-time to Florida to train at the academy.

His sister, Sabine, also played professional tennis.

==Tennis career==
===Juniors===
As a junior Haas reached as high as No. 11 in the junior world singles rankings in 1995 (and No. 5 in doubles).

===1996–2000: World Team Cup champion, first title, Grand Slam Cup final, Olympic Silver===
In 1996, Haas became a professional tennis player. He played his first Grand Slam tournament at the US Open, losing in the first round to compatriot Michael Stich in four sets. He gained attention as a future star when he won his first ATP title in 1999, made it to the semifinals of the Australian Open, and was a finalist in the Grand Slam Cup. The following year, he won a silver medal at the Sydney Olympics defeating Wayne Ferreira, Andreas Vinciguerra, Àlex Corretja, Max Mirnyi and Roger Federer en route to the gold medal match where he lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He also beat Andre Agassi at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships in the second round.

===2001–2005: World No. 2, Masters champion, second World Team Cup victory and injuries===
In 2001, he won four ATP titles, including his first Masters shield, finishing 2001 as world No. 8 and only missing out on playing in the season-ending Masters Cup because of Goran Ivanišević&#x27;s Wimbledon victory, which meant Ivanišević took the eighth and final spot. In the 2002 Australian Open, he won in five sets against Todd Martin and Roger Federer, and in four against Marcelo Ríos to reach the semifinals. He led Marat Safin two sets to one but suffered from a stiff shoulder after a rain delay, and Safin won the match, taking the final two sets 6–0, 6–2. Haas was quickly rising to the top of the tennis ranks when his career was suddenly halted at No. 2 in the world by a severe accident that nearly claimed the lives of his parents, leaving his father in a coma. Haas spent much of 2002 taking care of his family. At the end of this lay-off, he injured his shoulder, requiring a major operation. He was plagued by further injuries and related complications afterwards and did not return to professional tennis fully until 2004. Before his parents&#x27; accident and his injuries, he had a winning record against several former and future No. 1 ranked players: 3–0 against Andy Roddick, 2–1 against Roger Federer, 2–1 against Marat Safin, and 2–0 against Jim Courier, as well as 5–5 against Pete Sampras. Haas won two more ATP titles in his return year of 2004, while trying to gain back his form.

===2006: Three titles, second US Open quarterfinal===

In 2006, Haas won three ATP tournaments and reached the quarterfinals at the US Open, where he was knocked out by Nikolay Davydenko after having been up two sets. Haas began having severe cramps in his legs in the third set. During the match he was visibly disturbed, repeatedly hitting his legs with his racquet, frustrated at the cramps.

At the end of the year, he had to win the Paris Masters to qualify for the Masters Cup, the ATP year-end final. He lost after a semifinal run to Dominik Hrbatý with health problems and did not play again for the rest of the year.

===2007: Australian Open and Davis Cup semifinals, back to top 10===
In 2007, Haas, with his long hair now cut short, had battled his way to his third Australian Open semifinal, which included matches against David Nalbandian and a five-set quarterfinal rematch against Nikolay Davydenko. He lost his semifinal match against first-time Grand Slam finalist Fernando González from Chile in straight sets. Despite this loss, Haas returned to the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time since 2002.

On 25 February, at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, Haas stopped Andy Roddick&#x27;s quest for the final, winning in two sets. This was the first time Haas had won a title without facing a single break point in any of his matches, as well as the first time he had won titles in consecutive seasons. Haas also became only the second player to win three titles at Memphis, the other being Jimmy Connors, who won in 1979, 1983, and 1984.

Haas reached the quarterfinals of the Pacific Life Open, an ATP Masters Series tournament held in Indian Wells, California, where he lost to Andy Murray in a third-set tiebreaker. In the 2007 ATP Champion&#x27;s Race, Haas, the 13th seed (10th-ranked), not known for being much of a grass court player, advanced to the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time, defeating Zack Fleishman, Tomáš Zíb, and No. 21 seed Dmitry Tursunov. His run came to an end after he suffered a torn abdominal muscle and had to withdraw a day before playing Roger Federer.

At the US Open, Haas equaled his best result in New York by reaching the quarterfinals with five-set wins over Sébastien Grosjean and James Blake. He beat Blake in a fifth-set tiebreak, saving match points. His run ended, however, with a three-set loss to Nikolay Davydenko.

===2008–2009: Injuries, Wimbledon semifinal, return to top 20===
In the first half of 2008, Haas was derailed by injuries, causing him to miss both the Australian Open and the French Open. This dropped him significantly in the rankings, as he was unable to back up his semifinal performance at the Australian Open the year before. He made it to the quarterfinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, defeating Andy Murray in three sets. He was then forced to withdraw from his quarterfinal match against Roger Federer due to injury.

He reached the third round at Wimbledon with a four-set win over Guillermo Cañas and a straight-set win over 23rd seed Tommy Robredo. He then fell to Andy Murray in four sets.

In the hard-court season, he got to the semifinals of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., but lost to Juan Martín del Potro. At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, he beat former world No. 1 Carlos Moyà, and then lost to Nikolay Davydenko in the second round. At the US Open, he beat 12th seed Richard Gasquet in five sets. He then fell to Gilles Müller of Luxembourg in five sets, despite cruising in the first two sets.

At the beginning of the new season, Haas pulled out of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open due to elbow problems. However, he appeared in the Kooyong Exhibition game, where he beat Mardy Fish.

At the 2009 Australian Open, Haas beat Eduardo Schwank in the first round and Flavio Cipolla in the second. In the third round, he fell to the tournament&#x27;s first seed and eventual champion Rafael Nadal.

At the SAP Open in San Jose, California, he joined forces with Czech Radek Štěpánek to clinch his first doubles title, after losing in the singles quarterfinals to defending champion Andy Roddick.

Haas lost in the first round in both Memphis and Delray Beach. He did not succeed in defending his quarterfinal points at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, as he fell to Novak Djokovic in the third round, after defeating Óscar Hernández and Rainer Schüttler. He suffered another failure in the Miami Masters, losing to Mikhail Kukushkin.

In Houston, Texas, at the River Oaks Men&#x27;s Clay Championship, Haas was defeated by Björn Phau in the quarterfinals, after he defeated defending champion Marcel Granollers in the second round.

As a qualifier in Madrid, he defeated Ernests Gulbis, before losing to Andy Roddick.

At the French Open, Haas matched his best result since 2002. He defeated Andrei Pavel in straight sets, and then won a five-setter against Leonardo Mayer. After defeating Jérémy Chardy in the third round, Haas was narrowly defeated by the former world No. 1 and eventual champion, Roger Federer, in the fourth round. At a crucial stage in the third set, Haas was only five points away from his biggest win on clay, but was unable to convert a break point that would have seen him serve for the match at 5–3. Federer hit a vital winner to save the break point, en route to a comeback victory.

At the Gerry Weber Open, Haas won his first title on grass in his 21st ATP World Tour final. In the process, he defeated fourth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round, Mischa Zverev in the quarterfinals, and Philipp Kohlschreiber in the semifinals. He defeated the tournament&#x27;s second seed Novak Djokovic, in the final.

This victory made Haas one of a small group of players to have won ATP titles on all three major surfaces (grass, clay, and hard courts.) With Haas&#x27; success at this tournament and at the French Open, his ranking rose to no. 35.

At Wimbledon, Haas won a five-set match against Marin Čilić. Haas was up two sets to love and had match points in the fourth set, then had to save two match points serving at 5–6 before the match was suspended due to darkness after over four hours of play, at 6–6 in the fifth. The next day, Haas broke Cilic at 8–8 and eventually held on to win. Haas then comfortably defeated Igor Andreev to reach the quarterfinals. There, he defeated Novak Djokovic for the second time in three weeks to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time in his career, where he faced Roger Federer in a rematch of their encounter in Paris. Haas lost, ensuring Federer&#x27;s historic seventh Wimbledon final. This success at Wimbledon made Haas rise to No. 19 in the rankings.

Haas continued his late career resurgence by making it to the semifinals at the LA Tennis Open, defeating Marat Safin in the quarterfinals, before losing to Sam Querrey. He made it to the third round at the US Open, losing narrowly to Fernando Verdasco, after being up a break in each set.

===2010–2011: Continued injuries and absence ===
Following his comeback, however, Haas suffered from another bout of injury. He made the third round of the 2010 Australian Open, defeating Simon Greul and Janko Tipsarević, but did not play after February 2010, spending time recovering from right hip and right shoulder surgeries. He missed the rest of the 2010 season and once more dropped out of the ATP rankings. He returned to action partnering Radek Štěpánek in doubles in Munich in May 2011, but then lost in the first round. His return match in singles came at the 2011 French Open, where he lost in round one. He also went down in the first round at Wimbledon, but reached the third round of the US Open, losing to Juan Mónaco in four sets. Other than Grand Slams, he played little tennis, competing in only ten other tournaments, mainly in July, August, and October.

===2012: 13th title, second ATP Comeback Player of the Year award===

Haas began the 2012 season at the Brisbane International, but had to withdraw in the second round. Nevertheless, he competed more regularly in 2012 than in previous seasons. He qualified for the French Open, progressing to the third round, and reached the semifinals of the BMW Open, returning to the world&#x27;s top 100.

As a wildcard at the Gerry Weber Open in Germany, Haas won the title for the second time thanks to wins over former champions Tomáš Berdych and Philipp Kohlschreiber en route to the final, where he defeated world No. 3 and five-time champion Federer in two sets. However, Haas was subsequently defeated in the first round of Wimbledon later that month, letting a two-sets-to-one lead slip against compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Haas lost to world No. 206, Pavol Červenák in the Stuttgart clay-court tournament at the second-round stage.

Haas continued to find good form during the second half of the season. He reached the finals of the German Open Tennis Championships 2012, losing to Juan Mónaco, and the Citi Open, losing to Alexandr Dolgopolov. These two runs saw Haas rise back into the top 50. Haas went on to reach two quarterfinals in Masters 1000 tournaments, his best performance at that level since 2008. Haas briefly returned to the top 20 in the world in October 2012, and he finished the season ranked No. 21. This was enough to earn him the Comeback Player of the Year award for a second time.

===2013: French Open quarterfinal, victory over No.1, comeback to No.11 ===
Haas lost in the Australian Open first round. In February at the SAP Open he reached his 25th career final against defending champion Milos Raonic, but lost in straight sets. Next he played in Delray Beach International Tennis Championships as a former 2006 champion, where he lost to Ernests Gulbis in three sets in the semifinals.

At Indian Wells, he lost in the fourth round to Juan Martín del Potro after saving match point to beat Nicolás Almagro in the previous round. In Miami, he beat world No. 1, Novak Djokovic, in straight sets. It was his first victory over a top-ranked player since he defeated Andre Agassi in 1999. He followed this up with a victory over Gilles Simon to reach his first Miami semifinal, and first Masters 1000 semifinal since the 2006 Paris Masters. There, he lost to third seed David Ferrer, 6–4, 2–6, 3–6.

In May, he won his first title of the year at Munich, beating Philipp Kohlschreiber in an all-German final.

Haas made history at the French Open, when he missed a record twelve match points against John Isner in the fourth set of their third round match. Isner won the set on a tiebreak, but in the fifth set Haas went on to recover from 2–4 down and saved a match point against him at 4–5 to eventually win 10–8. Haas beat Mikhail Youzhny in the fourth round but eventually lost to Djokovic in straight sets in the quarter finals.

At Wimbledon, Haas advanced to the fourth round to set up a rematch against Djokovic but again lost in straight sets.

===2014–2018: Last career final, Indian Wells Tournament Director, retirement===
====2014====

Haas started the season at the Heineken Open in Auckland, where he lost in the second round against Jack Sock in straight sets. At the Australian Open, he was forced to retire with a recurring shoulder problem against Guillermo García López in the first round after trailing 5–7, 2–5 on serve. After the setback, he participated in the first round of the Davis Cup against Spain. He teamed up alongside Philipp Kohlschreiber in doubles, taking a four-set victory to hand Germany a place in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2011.

Haas then hired compatriot Alexander Waske as his new coach. His goal was to qualify for his first season-end ATP World Tour Finals. In his next tournament, the Zagreb Indoors, Haas reached the final by defeating Benjamin Becker, Andrey Kuznetsov, and Daniel Evans. In the final, he was beaten by defending champion Marin Čilić in straight sets.

At the 2014 BMW Open, Haas was the defending champion. He made it to the semifinals, but lost to Martin Kližan. Haas reached the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open, where he was defeated by Roger Federer in straight sets. Haas reached the quarterfinals of the Rome Masters after beating third seed Stan Wawrinka. He then retired in the quarterfinals to Grigor Dimitrov.

Haas missed the rest of the 2014 season to have an operation on his injured right shoulder which had forced him to retire from several events.

====2015====
After a later than expected return from injury, in the grass court season in June 2015, Haas played his comeback match at Stuttgart as a wild card. In the first round he beat Mikhail Kukushkin in straight sets but then lost to Bernard Tomic in straight sets in the second round. Haas then played at the Gerry Weber Open, losing in the first round to eventual finalist Andreas Seppi. His next tournament was Wimbledon, where he reached the second round. After beating Dušan Lajović, he lost to world No. 8 Milos Raonic in four sets.. At the US Open, Haas was defeated by Fernando Verdasco in a five-setter in the first round.

====2016====
In April 2016, Haas, at 38, had toe surgery and was out for nine months, &quot;I know that there&#x27;s a chance that I might not come back from this&quot;, Haas said. &quot;I know it will be a very, very hard task, but there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind I&#x27;m certainly going to try.&quot;

In June 2016, Tommy Haas was named the new Indian Wells Tournament Director. &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled to join the BNP Paribas Open as its new Tournament Director and look forward to working with one of the finest sporting events in the world&quot;, said Haas. &quot;There is a reason that the BNP Paribas Open has been voted Tournament of the Year by both tours for consecutive years, as the tournament and venue continue to provide a world-class experience for players, fans and sponsors. I look forward to joining the experienced Indian Wells staff, building upon the foundation they have created, and working to take the event to even greater heights.&quot;

====2017====
In January 2017, Haas made his first ATP Tour appearance in 15 months at the Australian Open. In the first round, he retired after the second set because he felt physically &quot;empty&quot;.

In April 2017, Haas won his first match at ATP-level in 21 months in Houston. At the age of 39, he defeated the almost 20 years younger Reilly Opelka in the first round. This victory made him the oldest player to win an ATP Tour match since Jimmy Connors in 1995. He then lost to top seed Jack Sock in three sets.

At the Monte-Carlo Masters, Haas beat world No. 40 Benoît Paire in straight sets in the first round. In the second round, he lost to Tomáš Berdych in a close match.

In June, Haas reached the quarterfinals of the MercedesCup in Stuttgart after upsetting Roger Federer in the second round and Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the first round. In the quarterfinals, he lost to sixth seed Mischa Zverev in straight sets.

Haas played his last ATP tournament in Kitzbühel in August 2017, where he lost in the first round to compatriot Jan-Lennard Struff. He was not given a wild card for the US Open and cancelled his participation at the Vienna Open.

====2018====
At the 2018 Australian Open, Haas coached Lucas Pouille.

In February, it was assumed that Haas ended his career because of an interview he gave a California newspaper. On 15 March 2018, he officially announced his retirement from the ATP World Tour.

==Post-retirement activity==
In July 2020, Haas played the Berlin tennis exhibitions, where he beat Jan-Lennard Struff before he lost to Dominic Thiem.

==Playing style==
Haas was an all-court player, capable of playing well on clay, hard, and grass surfaces. Nick Bollettieri noted Haas as having &quot;one of the greatest backhands in the world&quot;, praising its versatility and power. Haas also possessed a powerful slice backhand, which he used to disrupt the rhythm of the point and to construct offensive positions. He also possessed a strong serve and a functional set of volleys.

Haas was known for his refined footwork and racquet skills, both of which he used to construct quick defensive-to-offensive transitions. He was widely considered one of the best players to have never won a grand slam, having been restricted by numerous injuries. Reviewers described him as having nice &quot;fluidity&quot; and how his game overall allows him to adapt to most situations, as demonstrated by his equal win percentage over both right and left-handed players, as well as his relatively even win percentages on all surfaces. Haas&#x27; mental game was described as solid, boasting a positive win record in deciding sets (3rd or 5th).

==Personal life==
On 27 January 2010, Haas became a United States citizen, but continued to represent Germany in tennis.

In 2006, Hass began dating American actress Sara Foster. They have two daughters, Valentina Evelyn (b. 2010) and Josephine Lena (b. 2015). In August 2024, they announced their separation after 18 years together.

<doc id="1118006" wikidata="Q1752642" url="?curid=1118006" title="Thanet District">
<text>Thanet is a local government district in Kent, England. The council is based in Margate and the district also contains the towns of Broadstairs, Ramsgate and Westgate-on-Sea, along with several villages. It takes its name from the Isle of Thanet, a former island which gradually became connected to the mainland between the 12th and 16th centuries.

The district lies on the north-eastern tip of Kent, bordering the City of Canterbury to the west and Dover District to the south. It is predominantly coastal, with north, east and southeast-facing coastlines.

==History==

The Isle of Thanet is the major part of the district. This was formerly an island separated from the mainland by the Wantsum Channel. The channel gradually closed between the 12th and 16th centuries through a combination of natural silting and artificial land reclamation. An Isle of Thanet Rural District covering the rural parts of the isle had existed from 1894 until it was abolished in 1935 to form part of Eastry Rural District.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the whole area of three former districts and part of a fourth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Margate Municipal Borough
*Ramsgate Municipal Borough
*Broadstairs and St Peter&#x27;s Urban District
*Eastry Rural District (parishes of Acol, Minster, Monkton, St Nicholas-at-Wade and Sarre only, rest went to Dover District)
The new district was named Thanet, after the isle which covered approximately the same area.

==Governance==
Thanet District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 Thanet District Council election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

The current composition of Thanet District Council&#x27;s Cabinet is as follows:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in February 2024, the composition of the council was:

The independent councillor and the Greens sit together as the &quot;Green and Independent Group&quot;. The next elections are due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 56 councillors representing 23 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district straddles two constituencies, one of which extends beyond the district boundary to include parts of neighbouring districts:
*East Thanet, represented by Polly Billington, Labour.
*Herne Bay and Sandwich, represented by Roger Gale, Conservative.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Cecil Street in the centre of Margate. The building was originally designed in the early 1970s to be a new headquarters for Margate Borough Council, but by the time the building was finished in 1974 that council had been abolished and absorbed into the larger Thanet District Council. The building was formally opened on 9 April 1975.

==Towns and parishes==
The district contains 11 civil parishes, covering most of the area. The parish councils for Broadstairs and St Peter&#x27;s, Ramsgate, and Westgate-on-Sea have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the title &quot;town council&quot;. The two parishes of Sarre and St Nicholas-at-Wade share a grouped parish council.
*Acol
*Birchington
*Broadstairs and St Peter&#x27;s
*Cliffsend
*Manston
*Minster
*Monkton
*Ramsgate
*Sarre
*St Nicholas-at-Wade
*Westgate-on-Sea

The town of Margate comprises an unparished area. The Thanet councillors representing the wards covering Margate act as charter trustees, choosing one of their number to be the mayor of Margate each year.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 census, the population of Thanet was 134,186, an increase of about 6000 in the ten years since the previous census.

==Economy==
The whole district suffers from seasonal unemployment, in spite of its proximity to London, because of various factors, among them being inward migration, high numbers of old people, and low numbers of affluent people. It is not helped by poor overall indicators for health. In a study of resilience to economic downturns, Thanet was poorly rated at 295th out of 324 districts. Unemployment levels are nearly twice the South East of England as a whole, and as a result a great deal of planning is being done to encourage more businesses to relocate to the District. The Thanet &amp; East Kent Chamber produces a weekly business digest, the Thanet &amp; East Kent Insider, which reports on economic activity in the private and public sectors.

New projects underway include: A new community centre for Broadstairs. Redevelopment and renovations are to be undertaken at Margate&#x27;s Dreamland (a Heritage Amusement Park); Cliftonville (Lido site); and a Holiday Inn (hotel), now open. A large retail and residential development on Ramsgate seafront, known as Royal Sands, started construction in 2011 but was quickly halted. A multimillion-pound art gallery The Turner Contemporary (opened by Tracey Emin in April 2011) in Margate and this has created the opening of many new shops in the Margate old town and visitor numbers have far exceeded expectation. Margate has been chosen as a Mary Portas retail town. Large investment and building work is taking place in schools across the island.

In addition, the District Council has introduced an empty property initiative and has compulsory purchased empty and derelict buildings with the objective of bringing them back into use.

The Thanet Offshore Wind Project, near North Foreland, began operating in September 2010. The project is expected to have a total capacity of up to 300 MW which, on average, is sufficient to supply approximately 240,000 homes with green energy. The project will thus make a significant contribution to the government&#x27;s national and regional renewable energy targets. Thanet Earth is the largest greenhouse development in the UK, covering an area of 91 hectares with 7 greenhouses each the size of 10 football pitches producing cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers all year.

Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs each have shopping centres with a mix of local and national retailers complemented by Northdown Road, Cliftonville, Westgate and Birchington-on-Sea. Westwood at the centre of Thanet has seen much major development in recent years with the building of Westwood Cross shopping centre which is the home of national retailers and several restaurant chains including a Travelodge hotel. Associated development has taken place around the shopping centre spawning other retail parks. National retailer Primark opened a new superstore in October 2012, the largest Primark store in Kent.

==Transport==

The rail connections are via the Chatham Main Line through Margate to Ramsgate, and the Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line. New high-speed rail links from London to Thanet began in December 2009, and it is now possible to travel from Margate to St Pancras railway station at an average speed of 96 kmh (around 60 mph); maximum speed of 225 km/h (around 140 mph). This will form part of the UK&#x27;s first true high-speed commuter service, according to the South Eastern Railway Company. Main road links are the A28 which brings traffic from Canterbury and Ashford; and the A299, north coast route. The Saxon Shore Way Long distance footpath skirts the coast.

There is an airport, now closed, at Manston, formerly RAF Manston, but later renamed by its commercial operators as Kent International Airport. The airport closed permanently on 15 May 2014. Because it was used as a U.S. airbase during the Second World War it has one of the longest runways in the UK, and while open it was designated by the United Nations as an emergency landing site for aircraft in trouble.

Ferry services are no longer running from the Port of Ramsgate, and the council is currently in dispute with the former operators over the payment of £3.3 million

==Health==
Thanet has a large hospital: the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, known as the QEQM. Extension work which started in 2007 has made the QEQM a major hospital site.

As of July 2010, overall indicators of health were poor for Thanet:
* Health is worse in Thanet than in England on average
* Life expectancy is lower than for England
* There are health inequalities: in deprived areas life expectancy is 5 years lower for women and 10 years lower for men
* Teenage pregnancies are high compared to the England average
* Estimated smoking rates are average but death rates from smoking are significantly higher
* Binge drinking is around the national average
* Children are significantly less active than average
* Significantly higher than average number of people admitted to hospital for alcohol-specific conditions
* Significantly higher than average rate of diabetes
* Significantly higher than average rate of mental health problems

==Media==
Local newspapers are the &quot;Thanet Extra&quot;, part of the KM Group; &quot;Isle of Thanet Gazette&quot; and &quot;Thanet Times&quot; (merged with Adscene, October 2009), (the Thanet Times was withdrawn in October 2012) all owned by Northcliffe Media; and the midweek Your Thanet published online by KOS Media. The county-wide newspaper &quot;Kent on Saturday&quot; also serves the district.

Local radio stations are;

*KMFM Thanet (previously known as Thanet Local Radio) owned by the KM Group. (All Programmes are networked with other KM Kent stations).
*Community non-commercial station Academy FM Thanet on 107.8FM and online and via mobile app it broadcasts from within Marlowe Academy, Ramsgate.
*The county-wide Heart South
*BBC Radio Kent

National TV stations carry regional news:
The ITV1 service is provided currently by Meridian Broadcasting; and the BBC South East Today.

Thanet also has a local online radio and podcasting service currently operating online only known as &#x27;Thanet Community Radio&#x27; (TCR). The station works closely with Dover-based &#x27;Dover Community Radio&#x27; (DCR) which operates in a similar way.

==Education==

Thanet has a wide variety of local schools including approximately 41 primary schools such as Drapers Mills, Palm Bay, and Upton. Outstanding secondary schools include Dane Court Grammar, and Chatham and Clarendon Grammar. The community learning within the district is varied and wide, including charitable training organisations such as East Kent ITeC Ltd, and organisations such as Margate Adult Education Centre, Thanet Skills Studio and Thanet Stage School. East Kent College is a provider of further education in Thanet and a Training Provider that works with local businesses to raise the level of education across the region. In 2023, Nelson College London overtook the former Canterbury Christ Church University campus in Broadstairs, offering HND courses in Business and Hospitality Management.

==Climate==
Thanet enjoys a maritime climate, being surrounded on three sides by the sea. This generally results in mild winters and warm, dry summers.

<doc id="1118008" wikidata="Q3620435" url="?curid=1118008" title="Anthotype">
<text>An anthotype (from Greek άνθος anthos &quot;flower&quot; and τύπος týpos &quot;imprint&quot;, also called Nature Printing) is an image created using photosensitive material from plants under the influence of light (e.g. UV light, rays of sun).

An emulsion is made from crushed flower petals or any other light-sensitive plant, fruit or vegetable.

A sheet of paper is covered with the emulsion, and then it is dried.

Some leaves, a transparent photo positive or other material is placed on the paper; and then it is exposed to direct full sunlight until the image part not covered by the material is bleached out by the sun rays.

The original color remains in the shadowed parts depending on the exposure. The paper remains sensitive against such rays. It cannot be fixed.

Note: The color of anthocyanidins, anthocyans, carotinoids, and other light sensitive plant material may depend on PH of the water and of the paper.

==History==
The photo-sensitive properties of plants and vegetables have been known to scholars for centuries. Among many early observations the experiments of Henri August Vogel in Paris are of particular interest. In 1816 he discovered that an alcoholic tincture of either red carnations, violets or corn poppy turned white behind blue glass in a few days, while it remained unchanged behind red glass after about the same time. Cotton and paper colored with these tinctures exhibited the same differences.

The anthotype process was discovered in 1839 by Sir John Herschel. Herschel referenced an experiment on October 11, 1839 in a paper published in 1840 at the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Herschel gave the anthotype process a proper introduction in his 1842 paper to the same institution. Mary Somerville built on Herschel&#x27;s research and documented it in a letter to him dated 1845. Sir John Herschel presented her findings to the Royal Society, giving her full credit in his 1845 paper.

Herschel&#x27;s research into making photographic images from flowers was limited and was ultimately abandoned since no commercial application was feasible from a process which takes days to produce an image.

The process continued to be listed in photographic literature of the time but was likely little used.

Over time the process earned a reputation for being too impractical. Image permanence have been brought into question, but this problem seems to be mostly related to choice of flower or plant matter.

==How it works==
==Other flower suggestions==
Henry H. Snelling writes based on his research: &quot;Viola odorata--or sweet scented violet, yields to alcohol a rich blue color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper. Senecio Splendens -- or double purple groundsel, yields a beautiful color to paper.&quot;

Bingham, quoting by Sir John Herschel, recommends Corchorus japonicus flower (japanese Jute) for a &quot;&quot;fine yellow colour&quot; that &quot;upon exposure to sunlight, it is in about half an hour rendered quite white&quot;&quot;.

<text>JasPer is a computer software project to create a reference implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e. ISO/IEC 15444-1) - started in 1997 at Image Power Inc. and at the University of British Columbia. It consists of a C library and some sample applications useful for testing the codec.

The copyright owner began licensing the code to the public under an MIT License-style license in 2004 in response to requests from the open-source community. JasPer operated as a component of many software projects, both free and proprietary, including (but not limited to) netpbm (as of release 10.12), ImageMagick and KDE (as of version 3.2). the GEGL graphics library supported JasPer in its latest Git versions.

In a series of objective JPEG-2000-compression quality tests conducted in 2004, &quot;JasPer was the best codec, closely followed by IrfanView and Kakadu&quot;.
However, Jasper remains one of the slowest implementations of the JPEG-2000 codec, as it was designed for reference, not performance.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;JasPer&quot; has simultaneous connotations with Canada&#x27;s Jasper National Park, with the semi-precious gemstone, jasper, and with &quot;JP&quot; as an abbreviation of the JPEG-2000 standard.

<text>The second Stanhope–Sunderland ministry (1718–1721) was a continuation of the British Whig government headed by The Earl of Sunderland and The Earl Stanhope. These had taken power in 1717 to form the first Stanhope–Sunderland ministry, and in 1718 they interchanged positions, with Sunderland becoming First Lord of the Treasury. The ministry terminated upon Stanhope&#x27;s death in February 1721.

<text>Tongatapu is the main island of Tonga and the site of its capital, Nukualofa. It is located in Tonga&#x27;s southern island group, to which it gives its name, and is the country&#x27;s most populous island, with 74,611 residents (2016), 70.5% of the national population, on . Tongatapu is Tonga&#x27;s centre of government and the seat of its monarchy.

Tongatapu has experienced more rapid economic development than the other islands of Tonga, and has thus attracted many internal migrants from them.

==Geography==
The island is (or including neighbouring islands) and rather flat, as it is built of coral limestone. The island is covered with thick fertile soil consisting of volcanic ash from neighbouring volcanoes. At the steep coast of the south, heights reach an average of , and maximum , gradually decreasing towards the north.

North of the island are many small isolated islands and coral reefs which extend up to from Tongatapu&#x27;s shores. The almost completely closed Fanga&#x27;uta and Fangakakau Lagoons are important breeding grounds for birds and fish as they live within the mangroves growing around the lagoon&#x27;s shores. The lagoons were declared a Natural Reserve in 1974 by the government.

==Climate==
Tongatapu has a rather cooler climate than the rest of Tonga as it is the southernmost group of islands in the country. Because of this, fruit production is lower in Tongatapu than it is in the warmer islands in the north.

==History==
===People of the Lapita culture===

Tongatapu is known as having one of the highest concentration of archaeological remains in the Pacific. The earliest traces of Lapita pottery found in Tonga was from around 900–850 BC, 300 years after the first settlements in Tonga were established. Archaeologist David Burley discovered the pottery around the Fanga&#x27;uta Lagoon, away from the Lapita pottery found at Santa Cruz in the Solomon Islands.

Tonga was always the seat of the Tui Tonga Empire, but in an area of distances up to , it was often only a symbolic rule. From the first capital at Toloa, around 1000 years ago, to the second capital at Heketā, at the site of the Haamonga a Maui Trilithon, none boasts more traditional attractions than the third capital at Mua (from 1220–1851) with more than 20 royal grave mounds.

===Europeans===
Tongatapu was first sighted by Europeans on 20 January 1643 by Abel Tasman commanding two ships, the &quot;Heemskerck&quot; and the &quot;Zeehaen&quot; commissioned by the Dutch East India Company of Batavia (Jakarta). The expedition&#x27;s goals were to chart the unknown southern and eastern seas and to find a possible passage through the South Pacific and Indian Ocean providing a faster route to Chile. The expedition set sail from Batavia on 14 August 1642. Tasman named the island &quot;t’ Eijlandt Amsterdam&quot; (Amsterdam Island), because of its abundance of supplies. This name is no longer used except by historians.

Commander James Cook, sailing the British vessel &quot;Resolution&quot; visited the island on October 2, 1773 by some accounts and by other accounts October 1774, returning again in 1777, with Omai, whereupon they left some cattle for breeding. These were still flourishing in 1789 when &quot;Bounty&quot;, under Fletcher Christian visited.

The earliest mention of the name Tongatapu (spelled &quot;Tongataboo&quot; in the text) was by James Cook in 1777, as he wrote his memoirs for the &quot;Three Voyages Around the World, Volume 1&quot;.

British and American whalers were regular visitors to the island for provisions, water and wood. The first on record was the &quot;Hope&quot;, in April–May 1807. The last known to have called was the &quot;Albatross&quot; in November–December 1899.

<text>Ludwig Ritter von Höhnel (6 August 1857, Preßburg – 23 March 1942, Vienna) was an Austrian naval officer and explorer. He was trained at the naval academy in Fiume, then part of the Austrian empire. His brother was the naturalist Franz Xaver Rudolf von Höhnel (1852–1920).

==Journey with Teleki 1887–1888==

Höhnel was the second-in-command of Count Sámuel Teleki von Szek&#x27;s expedition to Northern Kenya in 1887–1888. He and Teleki were the first Europeans to see Lake Turkana, which they named Lake Rudolf after the expedition&#x27;s patron Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, and also Lake Stefanie, named after Prince Rudolf&#x27;s wife Princess Stéphanie of Belgium. Höhnel acted as the expedition&#x27;s cartographer, scientist, and diarist. Teleki and Höhnel made numerous observations on the climate, flora, and fauna of the territories visited and collected more than 400 ethnographical objects, most of them from Maasai and Kikuyu tribes. Their observations provided important contribution to ethnographical knowledge. The scientific results of the journey were published by Höhnel in several articles and in a book written in German and translated into Hungarian and English, titled &quot;The Discovery of Lakes Rudolf and Stefanie&quot; (1892). In 1892 Höhnel was awarded the Carl Ritter Medal (silver) &quot;for a first successful pioneering trip and for [his] meritorious geographic performance.&quot; The East African chameleon, known as Höhnel&#x27;s Chameleon (&quot;Trioceros hoehnelii&quot;) was named after Ludwig von Höhnel.
==Journey with Chanler 1892–1894==
Between 1892 and 1894, Höhnel explored the territory in the vicinity of Mount Kilimanjaro with American magnate William Astor Chanler. They proceeded inland from the coast, mapping the north-eastern part of the Mount Kenya massif, the Guasso Nyiro River, the Lorian Swamp, the Tana River, Lake Rudolph and then Lake Stefanie. They were the first westerners to come into contact with the Tigania, the Igembe Meru and the Rendille people in this region (Carl Peters had passed to the south in 1889). On 30 January 1893, they were attacked by some 200 warriors of the Wamsara (a subgroup of the Meru), who retreated after killing three porters. The expedition was eventually stranded in what is now the Meru North District of Kenya because of the death of all of its 165 pack animals (probably due to trypanosomiasis) and the desertion of many of the 200 porters. On 24 August 1893, Höhnel was gored by a rhinoceros in the groin and lower abdomen and was forced to leave Chanler and return to Zanzibar and then Vienna, arriving in February 1894. Out of about five hundred photos taken during the journey, 155 photographs taken by Höhnel have survived.

During this expedition, Höhnel and Chanler explored over of previously unmapped territory, fixed the exact position of Mount Kenya, and viewed the Nyambeni hills, Chanler&#x27;s Falls, and the Lorian Swamp, and mapped the course of the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro River. Five specimens donated to the Smithsonian were previously unknown species, including two species of butterflies, two species of reptiles, and Chanler&#x27;s Mountain Reedbuck.

==Later life==
After recovering from his injuries, Höhnel became an officer on board the corvette SMS Donau, and traveled in 1897 to the Mediterranean and along the coast of West Africa south to Cameroon, then across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, and to New York and Newport, Rhode Island. During the trip, the ship&#x27;s captain suffered a heart attack and Höhnel was made provisional commandant until June 1898. Also on this voyage he met the future US president Theodore Roosevelt, who was then in his words the &#x27;much feared&#x27; police commissioner of New York. After this, Höhnel was assigned as officer of the deck to the central battery ship , whose executive officer was Commander Anton Haus, the future commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

In 1899 Höhnel became Emperor Franz Joseph&#x27;s aide-de-camp and later (1905–09) led an official Austro-Hungarian delegation to Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. He also commanded the Austro-Hungarian torpedo cruiser in a voyage to Australia and Polynesia in the summer of 1905. Höhnel was instrumental in introducing the chamois into New Zealand, negotiating the acquisition in 1905 of six does and two bucks from Neuberg in Austria. They finally arrived in New Zealand on board the &quot;SMS Turakino&quot; in 1907. He was the commanding officer of the armored cruiser and the commander of the navy yard in Pula.
In February 1907, he submitted a formal request to the navy for permission to marry Valeska von Ostéren (1870–1947) (permission was required as per Austrian naval regulations). However, permission was denied, because it was discovered that Valeska&#x27;s brother had published an anti-Jesuit novel in 1906 which had offended the powerful Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Höhnel was eventually forced to choose between his marriage and his naval career. He married Valeska in August 1909 and subsequently resigned in the rank of captain. In 1912 he was promoted to rear admiral, probably in recognition of his duties as aide-de-camp to the emperor.

===Post-naval career===
Höhnel wrote an autobiography centered on the turbulent years preceding the fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, providing insights into African exploration, the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and prominent personalities of the Habsburg court, including Admiral Hermann von Spaun, Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, and Rudolf Montecuccoli. The complete manuscript remained in the possession of the family of William Astor Chanler for many decades and was finally published in 2000.

Höhnel later wrote a 56-page account of his service as aide-de-camp to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, which was never published.

He died in Vienna in March 1942, and is buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Höhnel is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of chameleon, &quot;Trioceros hoehnelii&quot;. In 1958 the Ludwig von Höhnel Lane in Vienna was named after him.

<text>Lyngby Stadion is a combined football and athletics stadium in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. It is owned by the municipality of Lyngby-Taarbæk. It is the home of the football club Lyngby Boldklub, and Trongårdens IF athletics association.

The stadium has a capacity of approximately 10,000 with 3,100 seated. The stadium was taken in use for Lyngby in 1949 and it consists of two stands, the &quot;old&quot; and the &quot;new&quot; stand. The old stand was built in 1968 and the new stand, which primarily is a no-seated stand followed. Lights were installed in 1964. In 1989 the &quot;new&quot; clubhouse by the stadium was taken in use. In 2007 and 2008 there were many discussions if the stadium should be expanded, or whether Lyngby-Taarbæk municipality should build a new stadium for the club.

<doc id="1118032" wikidata="Q667289" url="?curid=1118032" title="Georgenberg Pact">
<text>The Georgenberg Pact (also called the Georgenberg Compact, ) was a treaty signed between Duke Leopold V of Austria and Duke Ottokar IV of Styria on 17 August 1186 at Enns Castle on the Georgenberg mountain.

The treaty consisted of two parts. The first part was an agreement under which the childless and deathly ill Ottokar IV, the first and last Styrian duke from the Otakar dynasty who had contracted leprosy while on the Third Crusade, was to pass his duchy to the Austrian duke Leopold V and to his son Frederick from the Franconian Babenberg dynasty, under the stipulation that Austria and Styria would henceforth remain united forever. The second part consists of a delineation of rights of the Styrian estates and citizens. It has been incorrectly called by English-speaking historians a &quot;Styrian Magna Carta&quot;, for it sought to maintain the rights of the Styrian &quot;ministeriales&quot; in anticipation of the Babenberg acquisition.

The territory of Styria at the time went far beyond the modern Austrian state of Styria, and included lands not only in modern Slovenia (Lower Styria), but also in Upper Austria, more precisely the &quot;Traungau&quot; region around the cities of Wels and Steyr, as well as the present-day districts of Wiener Neustadt and Neunkirchen in Lower Austria.

The case of succession came to pass upon Ottokar&#x27;s death in 1192, Styria has since then remained connected to Austria. The treaty was acknowledged by Emperor Frederick II in 1237. It was continued under the rule of the Habsburg dynasty after the line of Babenberg dukes became extinct in 1246; despite several interludes when the Styrian lands were ruled by Inner Austrian cadet branches. The Georgenberg Pact thus was the first step towards the creation of a complex of &quot;hereditary lands&quot; of the Habsburg monarchy.

The Pact formed an integral part of the Austrian constitution until the Revolutions of 1848. The original document is kept at the Styrian State Archive in Graz.

<doc id="1118035" wikidata="Q762268" url="?curid=1118035" title="Automatic programming">
<text>In computer science, automatic programming is a type of computer programming in which some mechanism generates a computer program, to allow human programmers to write the code at a higher abstraction level.

There has been little agreement on the precise definition of automatic programming, mostly because its meaning has changed over time. David Parnas, tracing the history of &quot;automatic programming&quot; in published research, noted that in the 1940s it described automation of the manual process of punching paper tape. Later it referred to translation of high-level programming languages like Fortran and ALGOL. In fact, one of the earliest programs identifiable as a compiler was called Autocode. Parnas concluded that &quot;automatic programming has always been a euphemism for programming in a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer.&quot;

Program synthesis is one type of automatic programming where a procedure is created from scratch, based on mathematical requirements.

==Origin==
Mildred Koss, an early UNIVAC programmer, explains: &quot;Writing machine code involved several tedious steps—breaking down a process into discrete instructions, assigning specific memory locations to all the commands, and managing the I/O buffers. After following these steps to implement mathematical routines, a sub-routine library, and sorting programs, our task was to look at the larger programming process. We needed to understand how we might reuse tested code and have the machine help in programming. As we programmed, we examined the process and tried to think of ways to abstract these steps to incorporate them into higher-level language. This led to the development of interpreters, assemblers, compilers, and generators—programs designed to operate on or produce other programs, that is, &quot;automatic programming&quot;.&quot;

==Generative programming==
Generative programming and the related term meta-programming are concepts whereby programs can be written &quot;to manufacture software components in an automated way&quot; just as automation has improved &quot;production of traditional commodities such as garments, automobiles, chemicals, and electronics.&quot;

The goal is to improve programmer productivity. It is often related to code-reuse topics such as component-based software engineering.

==Source-code generation==
&quot;Source-code generation&quot; is the process of generating source code based on a description of the problem or an ontological model such as a template and is accomplished with a programming tool such as a template processor or an integrated development environment (IDE). These tools allow the generation of source code through any of various means.

Modern programming languages are well supported by tools like Json4Swift (Swift) and Json2Kotlin (Kotlin).

Programs that could generate COBOL code include: 
* the DYL250/DYL260/DYL270/DYL280 series
* Business Controls Corporation&#x27;s SB-5
* Peat Marwick Mitchell&#x27;s PMM2170 application-program-generator package
These application generators supported COBOL inserts and overrides.

A macro processor, such as the C preprocessor, which replaces patterns in source code according to relatively simple rules, is a simple form of source-code generator. Source-to-source code generation tools also exist.

Large language models such as ChatGPT are capable of generating a program&#x27;s source code from a description of the program given in a natural language.

Many relational database systems provide a function that will export the content of the database as SQL data definition queries, which may then be executed to re-import the tables and their data, or migrate them to another RDBMS.

==Low-code applications==
A low-code development platform (LCDP) is software that provides an environment programmers use to create application software through graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional computer programming.

<doc id="1118036" wikidata="Q2647107" url="?curid=1118036" title="Suranne Jones">
<text>Sarah Ann Akers (née Jones; born 27 August 1978), known professionally as Suranne Jones, is an English actress and producer. Known for her numerous collaborations with screenwriter Sally Wainwright, she rose to prominence playing Karen McDonald on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot; between 2000 and 2004. Upon leaving, she furthered her television career in drama series such as &quot;Vincent&quot; (2005–2006), &quot;Strictly Confidential&quot; (2006), &quot;Harley Street&quot; (2008), and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (2009).

Jones starred as Detective Rachel Bailey in the police procedural &quot;Scott &amp; Bailey&quot; (2011–2016), and garnered further attention with headline roles in &quot;Single Father&quot;, &quot;Five Days&quot; (both 2010), &quot;A Touch of Cloth&quot; (2012–2014), and &quot;The Crimson Field&quot; (2014). For her portrayal of Gemma Foster—a GP who suffers personal betrayal—in &quot;Doctor Foster&quot; (2015–2017), Jones received several awards, including the 2016 British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. Subsequent credits include &quot;Save Me&quot; (2018), &quot;Vigil&quot; (2021–present), and &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; (2019–2022). For the latter, on which she served as executive producer, Jones was again nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress.

On stage, Jones has appeared in productions of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (2005), &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (2009), &quot;Top Girls&quot; (2011), &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2014), and &quot;Frozen&quot; (2018). She is married and has one child.

==Early life==
Jones was born Sarah Ann Jones in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, on 27 August 1978. She has an older brother named Gary. Jones was raised Catholic; her priest suggested to her father she be christened Sarah Ann(e) instead of Suranne, her great-grandmother&#x27;s name, as Suranne was not &quot;a proper name&quot;. 

She grew up in a house on Foxdenton Lane, surrounded by two farms and their fields and commented that one of her earliest memories is of &quot;cows looking in the window as we ate our tea&quot;. As a child she was talkative, and later recounted that her priest would tell her, &quot;I&#x27;m praying you can concentrate just a bit more&quot;.

Jones was educated at Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School in Middleton. Talking of her childhood, she commented, &quot;I think I always wanted to be different and felt very stifled at school&quot;. She also said, &quot;I was bullied at school and I let that get hold of me and withdrew into myself — I regret letting that happen.&quot; She became a member of the Oldham Theatre Workshop and completed a BTEC National Diploma in Performing Arts, which she felt &quot;[wasn&#x27;t] quite the same as drama school&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
Jones began acting professionally aged 16. Andrew Billen of &quot;The Times&quot;, acknowledging her professional career beginnings at 16, wrote that &quot;she took to the stage at 8&quot;. Jones later said that her first role was at the age of 8, in &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; as Gloria. 

Upon joining the trade union Equity, Jones took on the stage name &quot;Suranne Jones&quot;, as her birth name was already taken, and union rules dictate that each union member must have a different name. Having obtained an agent at 15, she began to act in the theatre. Jones&#x27;s television career began in 1997, with a small role in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in April 1997 as Mandy Phillips, a girlfriend of Chris Collins (Matthew Marsden). She was then cast in a television advert for Maltesers, guest starred in episodes of series such as &quot;City Central&quot; and had a small role in &quot;My Wonderful Life&quot;. She auditioned for the role of Charity Dingle on the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, becoming one of the final four actresses considered for the part, although the role was eventually given to Emma Atkins. She also auditioned for the part of Geena Gregory on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, although she felt she knew Jennifer James would win the role — which she did — upon seeing her at the auditions.

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
In 2000, some weeks after her unsuccessful audition for Geena Gregory, Jones was contacted by &quot;Coronation Street&quot; bosses, who offered her the part of a new character. Jones took on the role of Karen Phillips (no relation to Mandy), making her first appearance on 21 June. The character, after marrying Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), took on his surname, and became Karen McDonald. Described as &quot;a bulldog in hoop earrings&quot; and a &quot;Victoria Beckham wannabe&quot;, the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) receiving high viewing ratings. Jones also began modelling for men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;, saying: &quot;I was 21, and within three weeks of me joining Corrie I was in Barbados doing a bikini shoot [...] I was quite impressionable and I&#x27;d just say yes to everything because I wanted to keep my job. The press officer is saying: &#x27;Do this and you&#x27;ll be the new young funky sexy girl.&#x27; We were all doing it at that time, but I realised quite quickly that I needed to concentrate on what I was doing&quot;.

In May 2004, it was announced that Jones was to leave &quot;Coronation Street&quot; after four years of playing Karen. She described working on a soap opera as &quot;exhausting&quot;, remarking, &quot;I was living and breathing Karen McDonald&quot;. She made her last appearance as Karen on Boxing Day 2004. Of her tenure as Karen McDonald on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Jones later remarked: &quot;I just thought, while she&#x27;s brilliant and I&#x27;m enjoying her, I&#x27;ve got to get out&quot;.

===2005–2010===
Jones stated that upon her departure from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, she received numerous offers to appear in reality TV programmes, which she declined, quipping: &quot;lots of money to go off and eat a crocodile&#x27;s knob, or whatever&quot;. Ignoring reality TV offers, in autumn 2005, Jones starred in an ITV&#x27;s detective drama series &quot;Vincent&quot;, with Ray Winstone in the title role; this was Jones&#x27;s first television role since leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot; the previous year. In the same year, she starred on the West End stage in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; opposite Rob Lowe and John Barrowman, which earned her the Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in the musical special &quot;Celebrate Oliver!&quot; which was screened on BBC1. In 2006, she starred as Snow White in the pantomime &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; at the Manchester Opera House alongside Justin Moorhouse and fellow &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actor John Savident. She also appeared in Kay Mellor&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Confidential&quot;, in which she played a bisexual sex therapist.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2007, Jones starred in a Yorkshire- and London-based black comedy, &quot;Dead Clever&quot; with Helen Baxendale and Dean Lennox Kelly on ITV1. In autumn 2007, Jones undertook a national tour in the stage run of the film &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, where she played Emma, opposite Linda Gray and John Bowe. In 2008 she played Martha, one of the female leads, in the ITV medical series &quot;Harley Street&quot;. Her performance drew mixed reviews, with one critic commenting on her character&#x27;s &quot;ludicrous&quot; received pronunciation accent; the programme&#x27;s tepid critical reception, combined with poor viewer ratings, signalled its end after just one series.

In January 2009, Jones appeared in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, a three-part drama on ITV1, where she plays Ruth Slater, a woman released from prison after serving a 15-year prison sentence for the murder of two policemen. Naturally brown-haired, Jones dyed her hair &quot;tobacco yellow&quot; with &quot;big roots&quot;; Jones joked that whilst not filming she &quot;really should have worn a wig&quot;. Additionally, the character of Ruth wore no make-up throughout, with Jones stating she was left feeling &quot;quite exposed&quot;, but nonetheless saying &quot;Ruth wouldn&#x27;t have worn any make-up, I don&#x27;t think&quot;. Jones received favourable reviews for her portrayal, with Brian Viner of &quot;The Independent&quot; writing: &quot;a stunning performance, the stuff of Bafta nominations if ever I saw it. Heck, on the back of it she might even get propelled into the movies, and bring a bit of North Country sense to the Golden Globes&quot;. Viner summarised his review of &quot;Unforgiven&quot; by stating, &quot;Five stars all round, and six for Jones&quot;. Jones later stated, &quot;I loved that role. They don&#x27;t come along that often. It was seen by the broadsheets as well as the tabloids. It gave me a little bit of credibility, I suppose&quot;.

Later in the year, in November, she played the role of the Mona Lisa in the two-part episode &quot;Mona Lisa&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. In December, Jones starred in the Manchester Royal Exchange&#x27;s production of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, by Noël Coward, which ran until late January 2010. Jones was nominated for the Times Breakthrough Award at the 2010 South Bank Show Awards, the last ever ceremony, but lost to David Blandy. When discussing her nomination she said, &quot;You do question &#x27;What am I breaking through?&#x27; Am I breaking through the perception of people who just thought I was a screaming banshee in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;? Is it that I&#x27;ve worked hard and I&#x27;ve got better? Is it that now it&#x27;s alright to say that I&#x27;m alright? I don&#x27;t know what I was breaking through, but I knew that it was nice to feel included and patted on the back for a lot of hard work&quot;. Jones was described by Andrew Billen of &quot;The Times&quot; as being in a category of &quot;those brave, talented few who earn their wings on a soap and then fly gloriously beyond it&quot;. In March 2010 Jones starred in &quot;Five Days&quot;, a non-connected sequel to the 2007 series of the same name, as the female lead DC Laurie Franklin. Later in the year, she starred as Sarah in &quot;Single Father&quot; on BBC1, a character who falls in love with a widower, Dave (David Tennant), who was married to her best friend before her death.

On 18 December 2010, a cover of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;True Colors&quot; featuring Jones, by the Manchester Show Choir, was released.

===2011–2016===
In May 2011, Jones played the central character of Idris in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;; when the &#x27;soul&#x27; of the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS is extracted from the ship, Idris becomes its new host, allowing the TARDIS to talk with the Doctor through Idris. Jones was cast due to writer Neil Gaiman wanting an actress, in the words of Jones, who is &quot;odd; beautiful but strange-looking, and quite funny&quot; to play the role of Idris. Dan Martin, the reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noted that &quot;Suranne Jones arguably sets the standard by which all guest stars must now be judged here [...] Jones was electrifying throughout&quot;. Also in May, Jones played DC Rachel Bailey in ITV&#x27;s detective series, &quot;Scott &amp; Bailey&quot;, opposite Lesley Sharp, who plays DC Janet Scott. The series is based upon an original idea by Jones and Sally Lindsay, her former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; co-star. After strong viewing figures and moderate critical success &quot;Scott &amp; Bailey&quot; returned for a further four series between 2012 and 2016, with Jones serving as an executive producer on series five.

In July 2011, Jones starred as Marlene, a career woman living in Thatcher&#x27;s Britain, in the Minerva Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Top Girls&quot; by Caryl Churchill in Chichester. Michael Billington, reviewing it for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, remarked that &quot;Suranne Jones captures excellently the hidden regrets of the go-getting Marlene&quot;. The production was later transferred to the West End&#x27;s Trafalgar Studios. In August 2011, it was announced that Jones would star alongside John Hannah in a spoof detective drama written by Charlie Brooker and Daniel Maier called &quot;A Touch of Cloth&quot;. The programme aired in August 2012 on Sky1. Jones plays DC Anne Oldman, the &quot;plucky, no-nonsense sidekick&quot; of DCI Jack Cloth (Hannah). In March 2012, Jones began filming &quot;The Secret of Crickley Hall&quot;, a BBC1 dramatisation of the 2006 best-selling novel by James Herbert. She plays the lead role of Eve Caleigh, a woman who moves to Crickley Hall in an attempt to move on from the loss of her son, only to be haunted by supernatural occurrences. Jones described the series as a &quot;classic haunted house spine-chiller with an emotional family story at its heart.&quot; Jones returned to the London stage in 2013 in a 20th-anniversary revival of Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s play, &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;. The play ran between 13 April and 25 May at the Arts Theatre, London, before a short national tour. 

In 2013, Jones starred as herself in &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot;: &quot;Stage Door Johnnies&quot;, a comedy mockumentary about obsessive theatre fans airing on Sky Arts. Later that year, Jones played a young judge &quot;battling to keep her head above water in the murky depths of the justice system&quot; in &quot;Lawless&quot;, a television pilot, broadcast on Sky1 as part of its Drama Matters strand. In August 2013, it was announced that Jones was cast opposite Hermione Norris and Oona Chaplin in &quot;The Crimson Field&quot;, a BBC drama set in a field hospital in France during the First World War. The drama, which was broadcast in April 2014, marked Jones&#x27;s first acting appearance in a period drama. In February 2014, Jones starred in Sarah Ruhl&#x27;s stage adaptation of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. The play received generally positive reviews from critics, with Jones&#x27;s performance being described as &quot;superb&quot; by Matt Trueman in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In September 2015, Jones starred as the title character in the BBC One thriller &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;, as a GP whose life begins to unravel when she suspects her husband of infidelity. The programme earned widespread critical acclaim, with &quot;Radio Times&quot; noting that &quot;a career-best Suranne Jones was unstoppably brilliant&quot;; the magazine placed &quot;Doctor Foster&quot; second in a roundup of the Top 40 best television shows of 2015. For her performance, Jones received the National Television Award for Best Drama Performance, the Broadcasting Press Guild Award for Best Actress, the Royal Television Society Award for Best Actor (female) and the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress at the respective 2016 ceremonies.

===2017–present===
In September 2017, the second series of &quot;Doctor Foster&quot; premiered, garnering positive critical reception. Jones, originally hesitant to film another series, was persuaded after hearing writer Mike Bartlett&#x27;s plans for the script. She also served as associate producer for the programme&#x27;s second series, which was filmed in autumn 2016. 

The same month, shooting began for an ensemble cast production of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, based on the 1848 novel of the same name. Airing the following September, Jones played the role of Miss Pinkerton, the haughty former headmistress of protagonist Becky Sharp (Olivia Cooke). In February 2018, Jones starred in the Sky Atlantic drama &quot;Save Me&quot;, playing the mother of a missing teen. Jones&#x27;s performance received positive reviews, with Rebecca Nicholson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing: &quot;you get the impression that Jones could act grief in her sleep, but she is impressively subtle here&quot;. 

From February to May 2018, Jones returned to the West End in a revival of Bryony Lavery&#x27;s stage play &quot;Frozen&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. Jones portrayed Nancy, the grieving mother of an abducted child opposite Jason Watkins. While the production received mixed reviews, Jones&#x27;s performance was well received, described as &quot;unflinchingly truthful and spontaneous&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;. Jones missed the last four performances of the show&#x27;s three-month run due to illness, citing the play&#x27;s &quot;deeply affecting&quot; subject matter as a contributing factor.

Later in May, Jones began filming BBC and HBO co-production &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot;, written, produced and directed by Sally Wainwright. Jones had signed on in July 2017 to play the lead role of Anne Lister, a lesbian Yorkshire industrialist in the 1830s. Described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;a core member of Wainwright&#x27;s unofficial repertory company&quot;, the series marks Jones&#x27;s fourth collaboration with Wainwright. Premiering in April 2019 in the US and a month later in the UK, James Poniewozik of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Jones&#x27;s performance is a marvel, exuding vitality, charisma and sexual confidence. But she also brings Anne an empathy, humanity and glimpses of vulnerability that make her more than simply a flawless Regency-era Mary Sue.&quot; Jones&#x27;s performance was also praised by Matthew Gilbert of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, who wrote: &quot;Jones is a gale force wind on the show, driving it forward with her confidence and cool. She gives us a dynamic woman living out gender fluidity and attraction to women at a time of ignorance and intolerance. Her Anne rejects social convention—and has the money to do it—as she fervently and undauntedly pursues her desires. But then Jones adds in a hidden vulnerability that can be heartbreaking. It&#x27;s the best, most faceted performance of the year, though few seem to know that.&quot; 
&quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; returned to BBC One for a second series on 10 April 2022.

In July 2019, Jones received the script for the second series of &quot;Save Me&quot;, titled &quot;Save Me Too&quot;, with a 14-week shoot commencing the following month. &quot;Save Me Too&quot; was released on 1 April 2020, and a third season was expected in 2022.

On 1 November 2019, a collaborative cover of &quot;Symphony&quot; by Jones and the Half Moon Theatre was released as a part of the BBC Children In Need album &quot;Got It Covered&quot;. Jones also provided uncredited vocals on the album&#x27;s cover track &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;.

On 5 August 2021, Jones appeared in the title role of &quot;I Am Victoria&quot;, the first in a second series of one-off dramas created by BAFTA winner Dominic Savage, focussing on various women&#x27;s issues, in this case, mental health challenges.

Jones subsequently took the lead role of DCI Amy Silva in the six-episode BBC series &quot;Vigil&quot;, which aired weekly in the UK from 29 August 2021, and streamed all episodes on 23 December in the US. The submarine thriller with an underlying lesbian love story drew an initial audience of 13.4 million viewers, becoming the BBC&#x27;s most successful drama in years.

In March 2022, the first project from TeamAkers, the production company formed by Jones and her husband Laurence Akers, was announced as &quot;Maryland&quot;, a three-part drama set on the Isle of Man.

It was announced on January 30 2025 that Jones and Jodie Whittaker would star in &quot;Frauds&quot;, a 6-part ITV heist series about 2 confidence women.

==Personal life==
Jones lives in Muswell Hill, north London, with her husband, freelance scriptwriter and former magazine editor Laurence Akers. They met in 2013 at the wedding of Jones&#x27;s long-term friend, actress Sally Lindsay, to musician Steve White. They were married in 2014. In an interview with &quot;Vogue&quot;, Jones stated that her legal name had become Sarah Anne Akers. She gave birth to a son in March 2016.

Jones has been involved with various charitable organisations. When she was a teenager, her mother Jenny was diagnosed with breast cancer, with Jones saying, &quot;At the time we did a breast cancer campaign together. I still do a lot of charity runs.&quot; Jones also has worked with Christian Aid, travelling to Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo to help with projects concerning HIV, women&#x27;s rights and child soldiers.

<text>Jaisalmer , nicknamed &quot;The Golden city&quot;, is a city in the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan, located west of the state capital Jaipur, in the heart of the Thar Desert. It serves as the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer district. It is a former medieval trading center and the historic capital of the kingdom of Jaisalmer, founded in 1156 by Rawal Jaisal of the Bhati clan of Rajputs. Jaisalmer stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone and is crowned by the World Heritage Site, Jaisalmer Fort, a sprawling hilltop citadel supported by 99 bastions. This fort contains a royal palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples of both the fort and of the town below are built of finely sculptured yellow sandstone. The town has a population, including the residents of the fort, of about 78,000. Jaisalmer ranked 9th on Booking.com&#x27;s Top 10 The Most Welcoming cities in the world. It is the only Indian city on the list.

==Etymology==
Jaisalmer was founded by Jaisal Singh, popularly known as Rawal Jaisal, in 1156 AD. It is named after its founder, with &quot;Jaisal&quot; representing the king&#x27;s name and the term &quot;Mer&quot; or &quot;Meru&quot; is of Sanskrit origin, signifying a mountain or a high, prominent place, and it has been historically used in the names of various geographical features and landmarks, like Ajmer.

==History==

===Medieval history===

The state of Jaisalmer had its foundations in what remains of the Empire ruled by the Bhati dynasty. Early Bhati rulers ruled over large empire stretching from Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan to Sialkot, Lahore and Rawalpindi in modern-day Pakistan to Bhatinda, Muktsar and Hanumangarh in modern-day India. The empire crumbled over time because of continuous invasions from Central Asia. According to Satish Chandra, the Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan made an alliance with the Bhati rulers of Multhan, because they wanted to end the slave raids made by the Turkic ruler of Ghazni, however the alliance was defeated by Alp Tigin in 977 CE. Bhati dominions continued to be shifted towards the South as they ruled Multan, then finally got pushed into Cholistan and Jaisalmer where Rawal Devaraja built Dera Rawal / Derawar. Jaisalmer was the new capital founded in 1156 by Rawal Jaisal and the state took its name from the capital. 

===Modern history===
On 11 December 1818 Jaisalmer became a British protectorate in the Rajputana Agency.

Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, the main source of income for the kingdom was levies on caravans, but the economy was heavily affected when Bombay emerged as a major port and sea trade replaced the traditional land routes. Ranjit Singh and Bairi Sal Singh attempted to turn around the economic decline but the dramatic reduction in trade impoverished the kingdom. A severe drought and the resulting famine from 1895 to 1900, during the reign of Salivahan Singh, only made matters worse by causing widespread loss of the livestock that the increasingly agriculturally based kingdom relied upon.

The attempts of Jawahir Singh (1914–1949) at modernisation were also not entirely successful in turning the kingdom&#x27;s economy around, and the drylands of Jaisalmer remained backward compared with other regions of Rajputana, especially the neighbouring state of Jodhpur. Nonetheless, the extensive water storage and supply, sanitation, and health infrastructures developed in the 1930s by the prime minister Brijmohan Nath Zutshi provided significant relief during the severe droughts of 1941 and 1951. During 1930–1947, Jawahir Singh and his ministers also promoted technical education and the academic disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering in the state.

After the departure of the British from India in 1947, Jawahir Singh signed an Instrument of Accession to the new Union of India, while retaining some internal autonomy until the 1950s.

<text>A dental implant (also known as an endosseous implant or fixture) is a prosthesis that interfaces with the bone of the jaw or skull to support a dental prosthesis such as a crown, bridge, denture, or facial prosthesis or to act as an orthodontic anchor. The basis for modern dental implants is a biological process called osseointegration, in which materials such as titanium or zirconia form an intimate bond to the bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge, or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic or crown.

Success or failure of implants depends primarily on the thickness and health of the bone and gingival tissues that surround the implant, but also on the health of the person receiving the treatment and drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration. The amount of stress that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since biomechanical forces created during chewing can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using computed tomography with CAD/CAM simulations and surgical guides called stents. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy bone and gingiva. Since both can atrophy after tooth extraction, pre-prosthetic procedures such as sinus lifts or gingival grafts are sometimes required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.

The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.

The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury, inadequate primary stability), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10-to-15-year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time. Artificial intelligence is relevant as the basis for clinical decision support systems at the present time. Intelligent systems are used as an aid in determining the success rate of implants.
==Medical uses==
The primary use of dental implants is to support dental prosthetics (i.e. false teeth). Modern dental implants work through a biologic process where bone fuses tightly to the surface of specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.

The US has seen an increasing use of dental implants, with usage increasing from 0.7% of patients missing at least one tooth (1999–2000), to 5.7% (2015–2016), and was projected to potentially reach 26% in 2026. Implants are used to replace missing individual teeth (single tooth restorations), multiple teeth, or to restore edentulous (toothless) dental arches (implant retained fixed bridge, implant-supported overdenture). While use of dental implants in the US has increased, other treatments to tooth loss exist.

Dental implants are also used in orthodontics to provide anchorage (orthodontic mini implants). Orthodontic treatment might be required prior to placing a dental implant.

An evolving field is the use of implants to retain obturators (removable prostheses used to fill a communication between the oral and maxillary or nasal cavities). Facial prosthetics, used to correct facial deformities (e.g. from cancer treatment or injuries), can use connections to implants placed in the facial bones. Depending on the situation the implant may be used to retain either a fixed or removable prosthetic that replaces part of the face.

===Single tooth implant restoration===
Single tooth restorations are individual freestanding units not connected to other teeth or implants, used to replace missing individual teeth. For individual tooth replacement, an implant abutment is first secured to the implant with an abutment screw. A crown (the dental prosthesis) is then connected to the abutment with dental cement, a small screw, or fused with the abutment as one piece during fabrication. Dental implants, in the same way, can also be used to retain a multiple tooth dental prosthesis either in the form of a fixed bridge or removable dentures.

There is limited evidence that implant-supported single crowns perform better than tooth-supported fixed partial dentures (FPDs) on a long-term basis. However, taking into account the favorable cost-benefit ratio and the high implant survival rate, dental implant therapy is the first-line strategy for single-tooth replacement. Implants preserve the integrity of the teeth adjacent to the edentulous area, and it has been shown that dental implant therapy is less costly and more efficient over time than tooth-supported FPDs for the replacement of one missing tooth. The major disadvantage of dental implant surgery is the need for a surgical procedure.

===Implant retained fixed bridge or implant supported bridge===
An implant supported bridge (or fixed denture) is a group of teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. They are similar to conventional bridges, except that the prosthesis is supported and retained by one or more implants instead of natural teeth. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments in the same way as a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.

===Implant-supported overdenture===
A removable implant-supported denture (also an implant-supported overdenture) is a removable prosthesis which replaces teeth, using implants to improve support, retention and stability. They are most commonly complete dentures (as opposed to partial), used to restore edentulous dental arches. The dental prosthesis can be disconnected from the implant abutments with finger pressure by the wearer. To enable this, the abutment is shaped as a small connector (a button, ball, bar or magnet) which can be connected to analogous adapters in the underside of the dental prosthesis.

===Orthodontic mini-implants (TAD)===
Dental implants are used in orthodontic patients to replace missing teeth (as above) or as a temporary anchorage device (TAD) to facilitate orthodontic movement by providing an additional anchorage point. For teeth to move, a force must be applied to them in the direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment. They are indicated when needing to shorten treatment time, or as an alternative to extra-oral anchorage. Mini-implants are frequently placed between the roots of teeth, but may also be sited in the roof of the mouth. They are then connected to a fixed brace to help move the teeth.

=== Small-diameter implants (mini-implants) ===
The introduction of small-diameter implants has provided dentists the means of providing edentulous and partially edentulous patients with immediate functioning transitional prostheses while definitive restorations are being fabricated. Many clinical studies have been done on the success of long-term usage of these implants. Based on the findings of many studies, mini dental implants exhibit excellent survival rates in the short to medium term (3–5 years). They appear to be a reasonable alternative treatment modality to retain mandibular complete overdentures from the available evidence.

==Composition==

A typical conventional implant consists of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained. Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N .05 percent, C .10 percent, H .015 percent, Fe .50 percent, and O .40 percent) is the most commonly used titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, anodic oxidation or various-media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant. If C.P. titanium or a titanium alloy has more than 85% titanium content, it will form a titanium-biocompatible titanium oxide surface layer or veneer that encloses the other metals, preventing them from contacting the bone.

Ceramic (zirconia-based) implants exist in one-piece (combining the screw and the abutment) or two-piece systems - the abutment being either cemented or screwed – and might lower the risk for peri‐implant diseases, but long-term data on success rates is missing.

==Technique==

===Planning===
====General considerations====
Planning for dental implants focuses on the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of the bones of the jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants and there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.

It has been suggested that radiotherapy can negatively affect the survival of implants. Nevertheless, a systemic study published in 2016 concluded that dental implants installed in the irradiated area of an oral cavity may have a high survival rate, provided that the patient maintains oral hygiene measures and regular follow-ups to prevent complications.

====Biomechanical considerations====
The long-term success of implants is determined in part by the forces they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and increase the likelihood of failures.

The design of implants has to account for a lifetime of real-world use in a person&#x27;s mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of tests to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person&#x27;s mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.

When a more exacting plan is needed beyond clinical judgment, the dentist will make an acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.

====Bisphosphonate drugs====
The use of bone-building drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs, requires special consideration with implants because they have been associated with a disorder called medication-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow-release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high-dose or high-frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival. Additional precaution can be taken by administering pentoxifylline and tocopherol both pre-operatively and post-operatively.

===Main surgical procedures===
====Placing the implant====
Most implant systems have five basic steps for placement of each implant:

# Soft tissue reflection: An incision is made over the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each referred to as a flap, are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.
# Drilling at high speed: After reflecting the soft tissue, and using a surgical guide or stent as necessary, pilot holes are placed with precision drills at highly regulated speed to prevent burning or pressure necrosis of the bone.
# Drilling at low speed: The pilot hole is expanded by using progressively wider drills (typically between three and seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low.
# Placement of the implant: The implant screw is placed and can be self-tapping; otherwise, the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque so as not to overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).
# Tissue adaptation: The gingiva is adapted around the entire implant to provide a thick band of healthy tissue around the healing abutment. In contrast, an implant can be &quot;buried&quot;, where the top of the implant is sealed with a cover screw and the tissue is closed to completely cover it. A second procedure would then be required to uncover the implant at a later date.

====Timing of implants after extraction of teeth====
There are different approaches to placement dental implants after tooth extraction. The approaches are:
#Immediate post-extraction implant placement.
#Delayed immediate post-extraction implant placement (two weeks to three months after extraction).
#Late implantation (three months or more after tooth extraction).

An increasingly common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes the placement of a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.

====One versus two-stage surgery====
After an implant is placed the internal components are covered with either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is flush with the surface of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.

In the early stages of implant development (1970−1990) implant systems used a two-stage approach, believing that it improved the odds of initial implant survival. Subsequent research suggests that no difference in implant survival existed between one-stage and two-stage surgeries, and the choice of whether or not to &quot;bury&quot; the implant in the first stage of surgery became a concern of soft tissue (gingiva) management.

When tissue is inadequate, deficient or mutilated by the loss of teeth, adjacent bone or gingiva, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingival flat is surgically placed around the healing abutments. The downside of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two stages now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.

===Additional procedures to augment deficient bone in implant site===

For an implant to osseointegrate, it needs to be surrounded by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, it needs to have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement. All techniques of augmenting the alveolar bone in preparation for implant placement are invasive and associated with a degree of morbidity.

====Hard tissue (bone) reconstruction====

Bone grafting is necessary when there is a lack of bone. Also, it helps to stabilize the implant by increasing survival of the implant and decreasing marginal bone level loss. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of in bone height, and in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+ mm of bone, B=7–9 mm, C=4–6 mm and D=0–3 mm) where an implant&#x27;s likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.

To achieve an adequate width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The most frequently used is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft, forming a new bony base for the implant.

Three common procedures are:
# Sinus lift
# Lateral alveolar augmentation (increase in the width of a site)
# Vertical alveolar augmentation (increase in the height of a site)

Other, more invasive procedures, also exist for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where the blood supply to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best is based on an assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3 mm loss), moderate (4–6 mm loss) or severe (greater than 6 mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.

====Soft tissue (gingiva) reconstruction====
The gingiva surrounding a tooth has a 2–3 mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, a band of strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep the implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).

When an adequate band of attached tissue is absent, it can be recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods that can be used to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.Xenogeneic collagen matrices are used for gingival augmentation after dental implantation.

Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, a band of full, plump gingiva is needed to fill in the space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue complication is called a black triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4 mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.

====The orthodontic implant site-switching technique====
Alveolar bone resorption is a common side effect of tooth removal (extraction) due to severe tooth decay, trauma, or infection that limits dental implant placement. Surgical bone augmentation is associated with limitations such as high cost, bone graft rejection or failure, pain, infection, and the addition of 6–12 months to the treatment time till the graft matures. Compared with invasive bone augmentation surgery, orthodontic tooth movement has the capacity to regenerate the deficient alveolar ridge and create adequate bone volume for implant placement. This is particularly useful when restoring one or two missing teeth with implants; however, the orthodontic implant site-switching technique can only be used when there is an edentulous area adjacent to healthy teeth that can be moved orthodontically into the edentulous site and generate healthy bone volume for implant placement.

Orthodontic tooth movement can generate new bone. This is because of the fibres of the periodontal ligament (PDL) surrounding the teeth and attached to the alveolar bone, the stretched fibres in the PDL stimulate the osteoblasts depositing new alveolar bone. For instance, the orthodontic forced eruption of hopeless teeth can augment the bone vertically and eliminate or reduce the amount of bone graft required prior to implant placement.

Similarly, where there is a bone-deficient edentulous (toothless) site, it is possible to move the healthy adjacent teeth into this area, closing the edentulous space and simultaneously creating an implant site with enough bone adjacent to where implant placement was originally planned.

==Recovery==

The prosthetic phase begins once the implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance that it will integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even in the event of early loading (less than three months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.

=== Healing time ===
There are various options for when to attach teeth to dental implants, classified into:
#Immediate loading procedure.
#Early loading (one week to twelve weeks).
#Delayed loading (over three months)
For an implant to become permanently stable, the body must grow bone to the surface of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them). However, later research suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.

===Single teeth, bridges and fixed dentures===
An abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a &quot;stock&quot; (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.

The platform between the implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the collar of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.

Regardless of the abutment material or technique, an impression of the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There does not appear to be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.

===Prosthetic procedures for removable dentures===

When a removable denture is worn, retainers to hold the denture in place can be either custom made or &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; (stock) abutments. When custom retainers are used, four or more implant fixtures are placed and an impression of the implants is taken and a dental lab creates a custom metal bar with attachments to hold the denture in place. Significant retention can be created with multiple attachments and the use of semi-precision attachments (such as a small diameter pin that pushes through the denture and into the bar) which allows for little or no movement in the denture, but it remains removable. However, the same four implants angled in such a way to distribute occlusal forces may be able to safely hold a fixed denture in place with comparable costs and number of procedures giving the denture wearer a fixed solution.

Alternatively, stock abutments are used to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention to improve the quality of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.

===Maintenance===
After placement, implants need to be cleaned (similar to natural teeth) with a periodontal scaler to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone has periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns should be expected to discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from opposing teeth and the restoration material. Where implants are used to retain a complete denture, depending on the type of attachment, connections need to be changed or refreshed every one to two years. An oral irrigator may also be useful for cleaning around implants.

The same kinds of techniques used for cleaning teeth are recommended for maintaining hygiene around implants, and can be manually or professionally administered. Examples of this would be using soft toothbrushes or nylon-coated interproximal brushes. The one implication during professional treatment is that metal instruments may cause damage to the metallic surface of the implant or abutment, which can lead to bacterial colonisation. To avoid this, there are specially designed instruments made with hard plastic or rubber. Additionally rinsing (twice daily) with antimicrobial mouthwashes has been shown to be beneficial. There is no evidence that one type of antimicrobial is better than the other.

Peri-implantitis is a condition that may occur with implants due to bacteria, plaque, or design and it is on the rise. This disease begins as a reversible condition called peri-implant mucositis but can progress to peri-implantitis if left untreated, which can lead to implant failure. People are encouraged to discuss oral hygiene and maintenance of implants with their dentists.

There are different interventions if peri-implantitis occurs, such as mechanical debridement, antimicrobial irrigation, and antibiotics. There can also be surgery such as open-flap debridement to remove bacteria, assess/smooth implant surface, or decontaminate implant surface. There is not enough evidence to know which intervention is best in the case of peri-implantitis.

==Risks and complications==

===During surgery===
Placement of dental implants is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, such as the inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when the lining of the maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.
===First six months===

==== Primary implant stability ====
Primary implant stability refers to the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient&#x27;s bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading poses a higher risk of implant failure than conventional loading.

The relevance of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant in the first weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.

====Immediate post-operative risks====
# Infection (pre-op antibiotics reduce the risk of implant failure by 33 percent but do not affect the risk of infection).
# Excessive bleeding
# Flap breakdown (less-than 5 percent)

====Failure to integrate====
An implant is tested between 8 and 24 weeks to determine if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5 mm.

Dental implant success is related to operator skill, quality and quantity of the bone available at the site, and the patient&#x27;s oral hygiene, but the most important factor is primary implant stability. While there is significant variation in the rate that implants fail to integrate (due to individual risk factors), the approximate values are 1 to 6 percent

Integration failure is rare, particularly if a dentist&#x27;s or oral surgeon&#x27;s instructions are followed closely by the patient. Immediate loading implants may have a higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.

===Long term===
The long-term complications that result from restoring teeth with implants relate directly to the risk factors of the patient and the technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.

Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93–98 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.
In compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue and can cause periimplantitis.

Criteria for the success of the implant supported dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction on the part of the patient. The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5 mm on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic. In addition, the patient should ideally be free of pain, paraesthesia, able to chew and taste and be pleased with the esthetics.

The rates of complications vary by implant use and prosthetic type and are listed below:

====Single crown implants (5-year)====
# Implant survival: 96.8 percent
# Crown survival: metal-ceramic: 95.4 percent; all-ceramic: 91.2 percent; cumulative rate of ceramic or acrylic veneer fracture: 4.5 percent
#Peri-implantitis: 9.7 percent up to 40 percent
#Peri-implant mucositis: 50 percent
# Implant fracture: 0.14 percent
# Screw or abutment loosening: 12.7 percent
# Screw or abutment fracture: 0.35 percent

====Fixed complete dentures====
# Progressive vertical bone loss, but still in function (peri-implantitis): 8.5 percent
# Failure after the first year 5 percent at five years, 7 percent at ten years 
# Incidence of veneer fracture at: 
#::5-year: 13.5 to 30.6 percent, 
#::10-year: 51.9 percent (32.3 to 75.5 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent)
#::15-year: 66.6 percent (44.3 to 86.4 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent)
# 10-year incidence of framework fracture: 6 percent (2.6 to 9.3 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent)
# 10-year incidence of esthetic deficiency: 6.1 percent (2.4 to 9.7 percent with a confidence interval at 95 percent)
# prosthetic screw loosening: 5 percent over five years to 15 percent over ten years
The most common complication being fracture or wear of the tooth structure, especially beyond ten years with fixed dental prostheses made of metal-ceramic having significantly higher ten-year survival compared those made of gold-acrylic.

====Removable dentures (overdentures)====
# Loosening of removable denture retention: 33 percent
# Dentures needing to be relined or having a retentive clip fracture : 16 to 19 percent

==History==


There is archeological evidence that humans have attempted to replace missing teeth with root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of precious metals. Some Egyptian mummies were found to have transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made of ivory. Etruscans produced the first pontics using single gold bands as early as 630 BC and perhaps earlier. Wilson Popenoe and his wife in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower mandible of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of sea shells, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, and the formation of calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.

In modern times, a tooth replica implant was reported as early as 1969, but the polymethacrylate tooth analogue was encapsulated by soft tissue rather than osseointegrated.

The early part of the 20th century saw a number of implants made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield&#x27;s implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal&#x27;s positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.

In the 1950s research was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised a method of constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the soft tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Per-Ingvar Brånemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed &quot;rabbit ear chamber&quot; for use in the rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Brånemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Brånemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, was one of the first to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Brånemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as &quot;osseointegration&quot;. Since then implants have evolved into three basic types:

# Root form implants; the most common type of implant indicated for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.
# Zygoma implant; a long implant that can anchor to the cheek bone by passing through the maxillary sinus to retain a complete upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, it has not been shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, depending on the size of the reconstruction required.
#Small-diameter implants are implants of low diameter with one-piece construction (implant and abutment) that are sometimes used for denture retention or orthodontic anchorage.

<text>The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) is a region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram populated by evolved cool luminous stars. This is a period of stellar evolution undertaken by all low- to intermediate-mass stars (about 0.5 to 8 solar masses) late in their lives.

Observationally, an asymptotic-giant-branch star will appear as a bright red giant with a luminosity ranging up to thousands of times greater than the Sun. Its interior structure is characterized by a central and largely inert core of carbon and oxygen, a shell where helium is undergoing fusion to form carbon (known as helium burning), another shell where hydrogen is undergoing fusion forming helium (known as hydrogen burning), and a very large envelope of material of composition similar to main-sequence stars (except in the case of carbon stars).

==Stellar evolution==
When a star exhausts the supply of hydrogen by nuclear fusion processes in its core, the core contracts and its temperature increases, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. The star becomes a red giant, following a track towards the upper-right hand corner of the HR diagram. Eventually, once the temperature in the core has reached approximately , helium burning (fusion of helium nuclei) begins. The onset of helium burning in the core halts the star&#x27;s cooling and increase in luminosity, and the star instead moves down and leftwards in the HR diagram. This is the horizontal branch (for population II stars) or a blue loop for stars more massive than about .

After the completion of helium burning in the core, the star again moves to the right and upwards on the diagram, cooling and expanding as its luminosity increases. Its path is almost aligned with its previous red-giant track, hence the name &quot;asymptotic giant branch&quot;, although the star will become more luminous on the AGB than it did at the tip of the red-giant branch. Stars at this stage of stellar evolution are known as AGB stars.

===AGB stage===
The AGB phase is divided into two parts, the early AGB (E-AGB) and the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB). During the E-AGB phase, the main source of energy is helium fusion in a shell around a core consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen. During this phase, the star swells up to giant proportions to become a red giant again. The star&#x27;s radius may become as large as one astronomical unit ().

After the helium shell runs out of fuel, the TP-AGB starts. Now the star derives its energy from fusion of hydrogen in a thin shell, which restricts the inner helium shell to a very thin layer and prevents it fusing stably. However, over periods of 10,000 to 100,000 years, helium from the hydrogen shell burning builds up and eventually the helium shell ignites explosively, a process known as a helium shell flash. The power of the shell flash peaks at thousands of times the observed luminosity of the star, but decreases exponentially over just a few years. The shell flash causes the star to expand and cool which shuts off the hydrogen shell burning and causes strong convection in the zone between the two shells. When the helium shell burning nears the base of the hydrogen shell, the increased temperature reignites hydrogen fusion and the cycle begins again. The large but brief increase in luminosity from the helium shell flash produces an increase in the visible brightness of the star of a few tenths of a magnitude for several hundred years. These changes are unrelated to the brightness variations on periods of tens to hundreds of days that are common in this type of star.

During the thermal pulses, which last only a few hundred years, material from the core region may be mixed into the outer layers, changing the surface composition, in a process referred to as &quot;dredge-up&quot;. Because of this dredge-up, AGB stars may show S-process elements in their spectra and strong dredge-ups can lead to the formation of carbon stars. All dredge-ups following thermal pulses are referred to as third dredge-ups, after the first dredge-up, which occurs on the red-giant branch, and the second dredge up, which occurs during the E-AGB. In some cases there may not be a second dredge-up but dredge-ups following thermal pulses will still be called a third dredge-up. Thermal pulses increase rapidly in strength after the first few, so third dredge-ups are generally the deepest and most likely to circulate core material to the surface.

AGB stars are typically long-period variables, and suffer mass loss in the form of a stellar wind. For M-type AGB stars, the stellar winds are most efficiently driven by micron-sized grains. Thermal pulses produce periods of even higher mass loss and may result in detached shells of circumstellar material. A star may lose 50 to 70% of its mass during the AGB phase. The mass-loss rates typically range between 10−8 and 10−5 M⊙ year−1, and can even reach as high as 10−4 M⊙ year−1; while wind velocities are typically between 5 and 30 km/s.

===Circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars===
The extensive mass loss of AGB stars means that they are surrounded by an extended circumstellar envelope (CSE). Given a mean AGB lifetime of one Myr and an outer velocity of , its maximum radius can be estimated to be roughly (30 light years). This is a maximum value since the wind material will start to mix with the interstellar medium at very large radii, and it also assumes that there is no velocity difference between the star and the interstellar gas.

These envelopes have a dynamic and interesting chemistry, much of which is difficult to reproduce in a laboratory environment because of the low densities involved. The nature of the chemical reactions in the envelope changes as the material moves away from the star, expands and cools. Near the star the envelope density is high enough that reactions approach thermodynamic equilibrium. As the material passes beyond about the density falls to the point where kinetics, rather than thermodynamics, becomes the dominant feature. Some energetically favorable reactions can no longer take place in the gas, because the reaction mechanism requires a third body to remove the energy released when a chemical bond is formed. In this region many of the reactions that do take place involve radicals such as OH (in oxygen rich envelopes) or CN (in the envelopes surrounding carbon stars). In the outermost region of the envelope, beyond about , the density drops to the point where the dust no longer completely shields the envelope from interstellar UV radiation and the gas becomes partially ionized. These ions then participate in reactions with neutral atoms and molecules. Finally as the envelope merges with the interstellar medium, most of the molecules are destroyed by UV radiation.

The temperature of the CSE is determined by heating and cooling properties of the gas and dust, but drops with radial distance from the photosphere of the stars which are –. Chemical peculiarities of an AGB CSE outwards include:
*Photosphere: Local thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry
*Pulsating stellar envelope: Shock chemistry
*Dust formation zone
*Chemically quiet
*Interstellar ultraviolet radiation and photodissociation of molecules – complex chemistry

The dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich stars has an initial role in determining whether the first condensates are oxides or carbides, since the least abundant of these two elements will likely remain in the gas phase as COx.

In the dust formation zone, refractory elements and compounds (Fe, Si, MgO, etc.) are removed from the gas phase and end up in dust grains. The newly formed dust will immediately assist in surface catalyzed reactions. The stellar winds from AGB stars are sites of cosmic dust formation, and are believed to be the main production sites of dust in the universe.

The stellar winds of AGB stars (Mira variables and OH/IR stars) are also often the site of maser emission. The molecules that account for this are SiO, H2O, OH, HCN, and SiS. SiO, H2O, and OH masers are typically found in oxygen-rich M-type AGB stars such as R Cassiopeiae and U Orionis, while HCN and SiS masers are generally found in carbon stars such as IRC +10216. S-type stars with masers are uncommon.

After these stars have lost nearly all of their envelopes, and only the core regions remain, they evolve further into short-lived protoplanetary nebula. The final fate of the AGB envelopes are represented by planetary nebulae (PNe).

===Physical samples===

Physical samples, known as presolar grains, of mineral grains from AGB stars are available for laboratory analysis in the form of individual refractory presolar grains. These formed in the circumstellar dust envelopes and were transported to the early Solar System by stellar wind. A majority of presolar silicon carbide grains have their origin in 1–3 M☉carbon stars in the late thermally-pulsing AGB phase of their stellar evolution.

===Late thermal pulse===
As many as a quarter of all post-AGB stars undergo what is dubbed a &quot;born-again&quot; episode. The carbon–oxygen core is now surrounded by helium with an outer shell of hydrogen. If the helium is re-ignited a thermal pulse occurs and the star quickly returns to the AGB, becoming a helium-burning, hydrogen-deficient stellar object. If the star still has a hydrogen-burning shell when this thermal pulse occurs, it is termed a &quot;late thermal pulse&quot;. Otherwise it is called a &quot;very late thermal pulse&quot;.

The outer atmosphere of the born-again star develops a stellar wind and the star once more follows an evolutionary track across the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. However, this phase is very brief, lasting only about 200 years before the star again heads toward the white dwarf stage. Observationally, this late thermal pulse phase appears almost identical to a Wolf–Rayet star in the midst of its own planetary nebula.

Stars such as Sakurai&#x27;s Object and FG Sagittae are being observed as they rapidly evolve through this phase.

Mapping the circumstellar magnetic fields of thermal-pulsating (TP-) AGB stars has recently been reported using the so-called Goldreich-Kylafis effect.

===Super-AGB stars===
Stars close to the upper mass limit to still qualify as AGB stars show some peculiar properties and have been dubbed super-AGB stars. They have masses above and up to 9 or (or more). They represent a transition to the more massive supergiant stars that undergo full fusion of elements heavier than helium. During the triple-alpha process, some elements heavier than carbon are also produced: mostly oxygen, but also some magnesium, neon, and even heavier elements. Super-AGB stars develop partially degenerate carbon–oxygen cores that are large enough to ignite carbon in a flash analogous to the earlier helium flash. The second dredge-up is very strong in this mass range and that keeps the core size below the level required for burning of neon as occurs in higher-mass supergiants. The size of the thermal pulses and third dredge-ups are reduced compared to lower-mass stars, while the frequency of the thermal pulses increases dramatically. Some super-AGB stars may explode as an electron capture supernova, but most will end as oxygen–neon white dwarfs. Since these stars are much more common than higher-mass supergiants, they could form a high proportion of observed supernovae. Detecting examples of these supernovae would provide valuable confirmation of models that are highly dependent on assumptions.

<doc id="1118047" wikidata="Q1018128" url="?curid=1118047" title="Palermo, Buenos Aires">
<text>Palermo is a or neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is located in the north of the city, near the Río de la Plata.

It has a total land area of 17.4 km2 and a population of 249,016. It is the only within the administrative division of Comuna 14.

Palermo is perhaps best known as the polo capital of the world. Each year, in November, the city hosts the Argentine Polo Open, commonly known as the Palermo Open.

==History==
The name of the area is derived from the still-existing Franciscan abbey of &quot;Saint Benedict of Palermo&quot;, an alternative name for Saint Benedict the Moor. Saint Benedict the Moor lived from 1526 to 1589 and is a complementary patron saint of Palermo, the capital city of Sicily.

In an alternative history of the name, a folk story supported by journalists, the land would have been originally purchased by an Italian immigrant named Juan Domingo Palermo in the late 16th century, shortly after the foundation of Buenos Aires in 1580. Juan Manuel de Rosas built a country residence there which was confiscated after his fall in 1852.

The area grew rapidly during the last third of the 19th century, particularly during the presidency of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who was responsible for the creation of the Buenos Aires Zoological Gardens and the Parque Tres de Febrero in 1874, and Plaza Italia and the Palermo Race Track in 1876, all on the grounds of what had been Rosas&#x27; pleasure villa.

During the 20th century, the Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens (1902), Jorge Newbery Airport (1948), the water purification plant, several sport clubs, the Galileo Galilei planetarium (1966), and the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens (1967) were developed.

==Subdivisions==
Although appearing as one big swath on the official map, Palermo can be subdivided into several contrasting and acutely individual parts, the most clearly delimited of which may be considered further &quot;de facto&quot; neighborhoods of Buenos Aires.

===Palermo Chico y Barrio Parque===
The most upmarket part of Palermo, &quot;Palermo Chico&quot; (&quot;Small&quot; or &quot;Exclusive&quot; Palermo), is on Palermo&#x27;s north-eastern edge, across Figueroa Alcorta Avenue and between San Martín de Tours and Tagle streets. Neighboring &quot;Barrio Parque&quot; is strictly a residential area, laid out in winding streets by Carlos Thays; many of the wealthy and famous own homes in this section, which also includes numerous embassies and the San Martín National Institute. It was once an area full of splendid mansions set in broad private parks; many have been demolished by developers. The quarter nevertheless remains one of the wealthiest in the city, home to luxury condominium and apartment developments, the largest of which is currently the Le Parc Figueroa Alcorta towers. MALBA, the Museum of Latin American Art in Buenos Aires, is located next door between Barrio Parque and the Paseo Alcorta shopping center.

===Palermo Norte, Alto Palermo y Villa Freud===
Alto Palermo is downtown Palermo, the main shopping area and transport hub around Santa Fe Avenue. Centered on Las Heras Park and the Alto Palermo Shopping Center, this section is the easternmost edge of Palermo and borders the Recoleta section known as Barrio Norte. Palermo Norte is located along Libertador Avenue to the northwest of Palermo Chico, and the site of landmarks such as the Argentine Automobile Club and the National Museum of Decorative Arts.

Villa Freud, based around Plaza Güemes, is a residential area known for its high concentration of psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, hence its name.

===Palermo Nuevo y Palermo Zoológico===

This area borders Palermo Norte further northwest along Libertador Avenue centered on the Monument to the Four Regions of Argentina; raised by the Spanish community in 1910, this landmark is commonly referred to as the &quot;Spanish Monument&quot;. The Buenos Aires Zoo, the Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens, La Rural expo grounds, the U.S. Embassy and Ambassador&#x27;s Residence, the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens, and Parque Tres de Febrero (commonly known as &quot;Bosques de Palermo&quot;, or &quot;Palermo Woods&quot;) are located in this area. Inspired by the &quot;Bois de Boulogne&quot; in Paris and the Prater (or Vienna Meadow) in Vienna, the Palermo Woods are the largest green area in the city of Buenos Aires and itself includes landmarks such as the Rose Garden, the Eduardo Sívori Museum, and the Galileo Galilei planetarium.

===Las Cañitas y La Imprenta===
Las Cañitas, further northwest along Libertador, was a tenement district early in the twentieth century; but it has since become an upmarket area of high-rises, restaurants and bars, particularly in the vicinity of the Palermo Racetrack and the Campo Argentino de Polo. The King Fahd Islamic Cultural Center was built in the 1990s just east of the Polo fields. The Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers headquarters and other military installations, such as the Central Military Hospital and the Military Geographic Institute, are located to the south.

La Imprenta, west of Las Cañitas, borders the Belgrano ward. One of its best-known landmarks is the Parish of San Benito Abad and the neighboring &quot;Solar de la Abadía&quot; shopping gallery.

===Palermo Viejo===

Palermo Viejo (Old Palermo) is, as its name implies, the oldest part. It runs from Santa Fe Avenue south to Córdoba Avenue, and from Avenida Dorrego east to Coronel Díaz Street. The neighborhood is centered on Plaza Palermo Viejo, and reflects an older Spanish Colonial Revival style in architecture, often &quot;recycled&quot; with modern elements. The new headquarters of the National Research Council, opened in 2011 in the refurbished former GIOL winery, is a notable recent example of this trend.

Such well-known figures as Jorge Luis Borges and Che Guevara once lived in this ward and indeed Borges first wrote poetry in the then quiet barrio. Borges&#x27;s poem &quot;Fundacion mitica de Buenos Aires&quot; names a typical square (bordered by Guatemala, Serrano, Paraguay, and Gurruchaga streets) adjacent to his childhood home, a popular tourist landmark. It was historically a residential area, popular with immigrant communities from Poland, Armenia, Ukraine, and Lebanon; as well as old Spanish and Italian families, whose traditions are reflected in local restaurants, churches, schools and cultural centres.

===Palermo Soho===

Palermo Soho is a small area of Palermo Viejo around Plaza Serrano (officially Plazoleta Cortázar) near Palermo&#x27;s south-western edge. It is a newly fashionable area for fashion, design, restaurants, bars, and street culture. The atmosphere in many cafés and restaurants strives to be &quot;alternative&quot;, which makes this area of the city especially popular with young, upper-middle-class Argentines as well as foreign tourists looking for a &quot;hipster&quot; neighborhood. The traditional low houses have been adapted into boutiques and bars, creating a bohemian feel. The square has a crafts fair.

===Palermo Hollywood===
In the mid-nineties a number of TV and radio producers installed themselves in the area between Córdoba, Santa Fe, Dorrego, and Juan B. Justo Avenues in Palermo Viejo. For that reason, this part of the neighborhood began to be called &quot;Palermo Hollywood&quot;. Currently, it is best known for the concentration of restaurants, sports clubs (such as Club Atlético Palermo, the oldest one), cafés, and an active nightlife.

===Pacífico===
This area is centered on Santa Fe Avenue, a few blocks both north and south from Pacífico bridge, so-called because of the Mitre railway line—previously called the &quot;Buenos Aires to Pacific Railway&quot;—bridge which spans the avenue and is an urban landmark and reference point. Pacifico is a mid-market commercial area and an important transport hub, for the train, metro and many bus lines connect here.

==Public transportation==

Buenos Aires Underground Line D has several stations within Palermo&#x27;s boundaries under Santa Fe and Cabildo avenues: Bulnes, Scalabrini Ortiz, Plaza Italia, Palermo, Ministro Carranza, and Olleros (at the limit with Colegiales). Currently, no other Underground line serves the area, but eventually Line F and Line I will pass through it once completed.

Four commuter railway lines go through the neighborhood: Retiro - José León Suárez (Mitre Line), Retiro - Tigre (Mitre Line), Retiro - Pilar (San Martín Line), and Retiro - Villa Rosa (Belgrano Norte Line). A total of five railway stations are located in Palermo. Inaugurated in 2011, the Metrobus Juan B. Justo also goes through Palermo, though there are no other planned Metrobus lines there.

<text>MX4J is a project to create an open-source implementation of Java Management Extensions (JMX). The JMX specification is a Java Specification Request (see JSR 003) currently in maintenance release 1.2; the new JSR 160 has been issued to address connectivity to a remote JMX agent. MX4J implements both JSR 3 and JSR 160.

The MX4J project goals can be simplified as:

* Closely adhere to the JMX specification.
* Develop a highly robust codebase.
* Be 100% compatible with the reference implementations.

Due to its simplicity, MX4J is widely adopted in open source projects like Jetty Server, Tomcat, Geronimo, Harmony, ObjectWeb JOnAS and many others.

Activity on MX4J project has now ceased.

<doc id="1118055" wikidata="Q2988641" url="?curid=1118055" title="Self-tapping screw">
<text>A self-tapping screw is a screw that can tap its own hole as it is driven into the material. More narrowly, self-tapping is used only to describe a specific type of thread-cutting screw intended to produce a thread in relatively soft material or sheet materials, excluding wood screws. Other specific types of self-tapping screw include self-drilling screws and thread rolling screws.

==Mechanism==

Self-tapping screws have a wide range of tip and thread patterns, and are available with almost any possible screw head design. Common features are the screw thread covering the whole length of the screw from tip to head and a pronounced thread hard enough for the intended , often case-hardened.

For hard substrates such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting a gap in the continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a flute and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth).

For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.

Not all self-tapping screws have a sharp tip. The &quot;type B&quot; tip is blunt and intended for use with a pilot hole, often in sheet materials. The lack of a sharp tip is helpful for packaging and handling and in some applications may be helpful for reducing the clearance necessary on the reverse of a fastened panel or for making more thread available on a given length screw.

== Thread-forming vs. thread-cutting ==
Self-tapping screws can be divided into two classes: those that &quot;displace&quot; material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it, known as &quot;thread-forming&quot; self-tapping screws, and self-tappers with sharp cutting surfaces that &quot;remove&quot; the material as they are inserted, termed &quot;thread-cutting&quot; self-tapping screws.

Thread-forming screws may have a non-circular plan view, such as the five-fold symmetry of the pentalobular or the three-fold symmetry of Taptite screws, while thread-cutting screws may have one or more flutes machined into their threads, yielding cutting edges.

==Self-drilling screws==

Some self-tapping screws such as the Tek screw brand, are also self-drilling, which means that in addition to the thread-forming section there is also a fluted tip much like the tip of a center drill. These screws combine hole drilling, threading and fastener installation into one driving motion (instead of separate drilling, tapping, and installing motions); they are thus very efficient in a variety of hard-substrate applications, from assembly lines to roofing. Some types incorporate a sealing washer, for fastening roofing sheets to purlins.

==Sheet metal screw==
Sheet metal screws (sometimes called &quot;sheet-metal self-tappers&quot;, P–K or PK screws from the brand name &quot;Parker Kalon&quot;, the company which pioneered the manufacture of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of screw which can form a thread in thin sheet metal. Pan-head self-tapping screws are common in metal cases for electrical equipment, while flatter-headed truss or flat countersunk headed self-tapping screws are found in aviation applications.

==Winged self-tapper==
Winged self-drilling have thin wings wider than the thread formed just behind the self drilling head. These cut a clearance hole in soft materials (such as wood or plastic), but are destroyed by more robust materials (such as metal). Thus, to clamp some material to metal, the clearance drilling, tap drilling, thread tapping, and fixing itself can happen in a single operation from one side, with the materials in their final position.

==Wood screw==

Wood screws are technically self-tapping, but are not referred to as such.

==Applications==
Self-tapping screws are used in a variety of applications ranging from DIY carpentry to surgery.

=== Surgical ===
Dental implants and orthopedic bone screws are both examples of self-tapping screws used in surgery. Different thread profiles are used for either denser cortical bone or the spongy cancellous bone.

<text>Wardite is a hydrous sodium aluminium phosphate hydroxide mineral with formula: NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4·2(H2O). Wardite is of interest for its rare crystallography. It crystallizes in the tetragonal trapezohedral class and is one of only a few minerals in that class. Wardite forms vitreous green to bluish green to white to colorless crystals, with pyramidal {102} or {114} faces and with {001} usually present masses. Also appears as fibrous encrustations. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 and a specific gravity of 2.81–2.87.

Wardite was named for Henry Augustus Ward (1834–1906) of the University of Rochester in New York. It first described in 1896 for an occurrence in Clay Canyon, Fairfield, Utah County, Utah, US.

==Occurrence==
It occurs with variscite in phosphate nodules and occurs uncommonly in pegmatites and phosphate deposits through alteration of amblygonite. 

Wardite is a rare mineral, which has been found in approximately 70 locations worldwide, but generally on a microscopic scale, with only a few occurrences of significant specimens. The finest specimens, boasting crystals up to 4 cm in size, originate from Rapid Creek and the Big Fish River in the Dawson mining district, Alaska (USA). Good quality specimens, measuring up to 1 cm, have also been discovered in Lavra da Ilha, Taquaral, Itinga, Minas Gerais, Brazil. In Spain, it appears in the form of crystals up to 1 cm found in cavities within montebrasite at the Tita mine in Golpejas, Salamanca.

<text>Bukovskyite (also known as &quot;clay of Kutná Hora&quot;) is an iron arsenate sulfate mineral with formula: Fe2(AsO4)(SO4)(OH)·7H2O which forms nodules with a reniform (kidney-shaped) surface. Under a microscope, these nodules appear as a collection of minute needles similar to gypsum. Some can be seen with the naked eye and occur inside the nodules.

Bukovskyite was first described from pit heaps from the Middle Ages, where sulfate ores had been mined at Kank, north of Kutná Hora in Bohemia, Czech Republic, and other old deposits in the vicinity. Only recently defined and acknowledged, it was approved by the IMA in 1969.

Bukovskyite was collected a long time ago from the overgrown pit heaps by the inhabitants of Kutná Hora. It was used for poisoning fieldmice and other field vermin. This poisonous clay, known also by the place name as &quot;clay of Kutná Hora&quot;&#x27;, was widely known and it was considered to be &#x27;arsenic&#x27; (arsenic trioxide). In 1901 Antonín Bukovský (1865–1950), a Czech chemist, who studied minerals of old pit heaps, proved it was an arsenate.

<text>The KC 85 (&#x27;KC&#x27; meaning &quot;Kleincomputer&quot;, or &quot;small computer&quot;) were models of microcomputers (KC 85/2, KC 85/3 and KC 85/4) built in East Germany by VEB Mikroelektronik &quot;Wilhelm Pieck&quot; Mühlhausen. The first model in the series, the HC 900, originally designed as a home computer and introduced in 1984, was renamed to KC 85/2 in 1985 to de-emphasize its use as consumer good.

Despite similar names, the KC 85 computers were not directly related to the KC 87 series produced by VEB Robotron-Meßelektronik &quot;Otto Schön&quot; Dresden.

The availability of the KC 85 series for private customers was very limited. The computers were mostly used at educational institutions, organizations, and enterprises.

==Technical information==
They were based on the U880 CPU (an East German clone of the Z80), with clock speeds of 1.75 MHz (KC 85/2, KC 85/3) and 1.77 MHz (KC 85/4). 

Unlike the Pravetz series 8 personal computers, manufactured in Bulgaria, which were equipped with dedicated displays, floppy disks and quality keyboards, the entire KC series used TV sets for display purposes. Connectors provided were TV-out via coaxial cable, composite video, RGB video. Generic tape recorders was used for data storage. The KC 85 used a separate keyboard driven by a remote control IC.

The KC 85/2 was the first computer made in Mühlhausen and had only font ROMs for capital letters, and no BASIC in ROM. Later, the KC 85/3 was introduced and this one had a &quot;KC-BASIC&quot; [de] interpreter in ROM, freeing the user from having to load it from a cassette every time. Both systems typically had 16 KB of free RAM, but could be expanded with add-on modules. The module sockets feature prominently on photos, as they occupy the upper 50% of the casing.
The KC 85/4 had 64 KB of RAM, not counting the video ram of more than 40 KB, and better graphics capabilities. In fact, the KC 85/2 and KC 85/3 were practically indistinguishable in board design except for a different ROM and an internal piezo speaker. The KC 85/4 board was redesigned, but featured the same digital-to-analog video PCB as the previous generation.

All KC-series computers from Mühlhausen were capable of displaying graphics at a resolution of 320×256 pixels. The video ram layout was awkwardly split into a 256x256 portion and a 64x256 portion to avoid a time-consuming multiplication with 40 when addressing video memory. On the KC85/4 the video ram layout was changed in a backwards-incompatible manner to 40 columns of 256 bytes and the bytes in one column were put into consecutive memory addresses. The kernel interface was of course kept as-is and software that relied on it could continue running unchanged. The color possibilities were limited in the typical color-cell fashion: each 4×8-pixel cell had a single foreground (out of 16) and background color (out of 8, slightly darker than foreground equivalents). 
This limitation was brought down to 1×8 on the KC 85/4 (the color cells on both the KC85/3 and KC85/4 were thus quite small compared to contemporary systems). The KC85/4 also featured a special 4-color (black, white, red, cyan) mode which could color every pixel independently. The colors were not paletted. There was no &quot;text mode&quot;, everything had to be painted; this combined with the video RAM layout described above and ROM code made the KC 85/2-3 rather slow at printing and scrolling (improved very much on KC 85/4). There were no blitters, sprites or hardware scrolling, not a single hardware register with which to influence the display drawing process, the sole exception being the blink attribute, whose frequency could be tuned by programming the dedicated CTC register and which required no CPU assistance. The KC85/4 added one bit to select which of the two buffers to display and one bit to switch between high color (using color cells) and high color-resolution mode (using the color RAM as a second bit plane). The video subsystem was developed in-house and implemented entirely with a few dozen series 7400 ICs. With the KC 85/2 and KC 85/3 CPU access to video memory would interfere with screen redraw and cause visual distortions as pixel data could not be read from VRAM and the previously loaded strip of 8 pixels was simply drawn again. This issue was fixed in the KC 85/4 too - one video period of 8 horizontal pixels is divided evenly into 3 phases: (1) an 8 bit wide CPU access (r/w), (2) fetch 8 bits of pixel data and (3) fetch 8 bits of color data. The KC 85/4 was also the first capable of switching between 2 independent locations in video ram, allowing double buffering.

Sound and tape output was implemented by a CTC IC driving flipflops to generate square waves. A zero was represented by one period of a 2400 Hz tone, a one by a 1200 Hz tone. There was also a sync tone of 600 Hz prefixing each byte. The signal from the tape was read back, passed through a band pass filter and an interrupt would be generated each time the audio signal crossed the 0 V base line.

Data was stored on tape in blocks of 128 byte. Each block was prefixed by brief silence and a
series of 1 bits. Approximately 8000 (7 seconds officially, but it could be shorter) for the first block and 160 (133 msec) for each
subsequent block. Following that was the 1 byte block number, 128 data bytes and 1 byte checksum.
The tape could be rewound in case a block was not read correctly and loading would continue at
that block offset. The first block of the file contained metadata: filename, file type, load address,
entry point address and so forth.

Memory bank-switching was common since the total address space was only 64 KB. When running Mühlhausen&#x27;s BASIC, the video RAM (at 0x8000) was banked in only during video operations, thus the maximum BASIC free RAM was about 47 KB instead of 32 KB. The module extension system also used bank-switching and made it theoretically possible to extend to megabytes of RAM (even more modules could be used by adding expansion devices, yielding sort of a tower), however neither BASIC nor most of the applications were prepared to use this as free space.

The keyboard of the KC 85/2-4 was based on the U807D, a clone of the Mullard SAB3021 used in TV infrared remote controls. The U807D scanned the 63 regular keys with its 8 + 8 drive/sense pins and produced a 7 bit pulse width modulated signal (0: 5 ms, 1: 7 ms). The main computer would detect the presence of pulse delineating bursts (150 us) and generate interrupts. The main CPU would thus be interrupted 7 times for each keystroke and could measure the time between the interrupts to recover the serial data word. A special shift key made the U807D produce keycodes 64-127. To the computer the keyboard appeared as a device with 126 keys. Transmission occurred through the same wire that provided power to the keyboard. Since the keyboard was connected to the 12V voltage rail through a resistor, an increase in current consumption could be measured between the resistor and the cable as a voltage drop, inside the main computer. The keyboard just had to set a digital output low and shunt some additional current to ground. All the while the keyboard supply voltage was kept stable by a simple 9V zener diode, with which the controller IC was connected in parallel and if it remained within a certain window of current usage, 9V is what it would see.

There was a single 8867 kHz crystal oscillating at twice the PAL chrominance frequency and a divide-by-10, multiply-by-16 phase-locked loop was used to derive a 14.2 MHz clock from which the pixel clock (7.1 MHz) and processor clock (1.77 MHz) was derived by division by 2 and 8, respectively (KC85/2, KC85/3 and KC85/4 used the same circuit for this purpose, since the digital to analog video conversion PCB where the clock generation was situated did not change between revisions). There was still a slight difference in effective clock rate, the KC85/2 and KC85/3 skipped a few CPU cycles at the end of each scanline, to provide in a simple manner to the entire system the illusion of a horizontal resolution (including blanking) divisible by 8, the KC85/4 did not. None of the revisions had provisions for either vertical blank interrupts or horizontal blank interrupts.

The wiring diagrams are freely available and there were also a lot of different (and often home-made) schemes and hardware parts. Various magazines published programs and hardware diagrams and also instructions on how to build them.


==Programming languages==
The KC 85 could be programmed in assembly language and BASIC (the KC 85/2 had to load BASIC from tape), but it was possible to use various modules (sold by VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen) or load software from tape, thus allowing programming in Forth and Pascal. The operating system was CAOS (&quot;Cassette Aided Operating System&quot;). It was a simple monitor where one could run different &quot;system services&quot; like LOAD (load a program), JUMP (into extension module ROM), MODIFY (memory cells) or BASIC (if it had been built into the ROM or had been loaded from tape). New commands could be added to the menu by magic numbers (standard: codice_1) anywhere in the memory space.

In the last years of the GDR, a floppy attachment (&quot;tower&quot;-style, too) was produced. It featured a 4 MHz CPU and a 5¼&quot; Floppy drive (you could have up to four of them). These (literally: the U 880 A in the attachment did) were able to run CP/M, which was called MicroDOS. (One had to JUMP from the base system to the floppy system and boot from a floppy—another CAOS or MicroDOS). There was also a disk extension mode for CAOS.

==Hobby projects==
There were a lot of different projects for the KC 85:
*a new keyboard (The original being extremely poorly manufactured)
*RAM disk
*interfaces (V.24 and others)
*text systems; &quot;WordPro&quot; actually featured 80 characters per line mode (4 × 8 font)
*connection to electronic typewriters (like the GDR-product &quot;Erika S 3004&quot;) as keyboard and printer (but dot matrix emulation was very slow)
*programming language BASICODE (a special BASIC dialect); BASICODE-programs were even broadcast by radio

<text>Campylite is a variety of the lead arsenate mineral mimetite which received the name from the Greek &#x27;kampylos&#x27;- bent, on account of the barrel-shaped bend of its crystals. It has also been used as an alternate name for pyromorphite.

It occurs in the upper lead deposits through the oxidation of galena or cerussite. The main deposits are Příbram in Bohemia and Dry Gill, Caldbeck Fells, near Wigton, Cumbria, England.

<text>Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary of the American Language is an American dictionary published first in 1951. As of 2022, the work is owned by HarperCollins Publishers.

==Overview==
The first edition was published by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, in two volumes or one large volume, including a large encyclopedic section. In 1953, World published a one-volume college edition (Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary), without the encyclopedic material. It was edited by Joseph H. Friend and David B. Guralnik and contained 142,000 entries, said to be the largest American desk dictionary available at the time.

The second college edition, edited by Guralnik, was published in 1970. World Publishing was acquired by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1980 and they continued the work with a third edition in 1989 edited by Victoria Neufeldt. A fourth edition was edited by Michael Agnes and published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1999, containing 160,000 entries; a fifth, edited by Andrew N. Sparks et al. and published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2014, contains around 165,000 and 1703 pages. The latest publication of the Fifth Edition is 2020, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. The newest edition contains 1728 pages. 

One of the salient features of &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World&quot; dictionaries has been its unusually full etymology, that is, the origin and development of words and the relationship of words to other Indo-European languages. The work also labels words which have a distinctly American origin.

The college edition is the official desk dictionary of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and United Press International. It was the primary dictionary of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; from 1977 until 2024, when it reverted to Merriam-Webster.

== Publisher ==

Although the title refers to Noah Webster, the work is unrelated to the series of Webster&#x27;s dictionaries published by the Merriam-Webster Company, which indeed are descended directly from Noah Webster&#x27;s original publications. By contrast, &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot; merely cites Webster as a generic name for any American English dictionary, as does Random House&#x27;s line of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Unabridged&quot; and derived dictionaries.

&quot;Webster&#x27;s New World&quot; student and children&#x27;s editions were produced for younger readers but were discontinued since 1996. Dictionaries for foreign languages, American English, Large Print, and English writing style guides have also been produced. 

As of 2024, its current publisher offers only the following works: &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition&quot; (2020 hardcover), &quot;Webster’s New World Dictionary, Fifth Edition&quot; (2016 mass market paperback), &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Pocket Dictionary, Fourth Edition&quot; (2016 Trade Paperback), &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Roget&#x27;s Pocket Thesaurus&quot; (2008 Trade paperback), and &quot;Webster’s New World® Crossword Puzzle Dictionary, 2nd Ed.&quot; (2017 Trade paperback.)

<text>Denebola is the second-brightest individual star in the zodiac constellation of Leo. It is the easternmost of the bright stars of Leo. It has the Bayer designation Beta Leonis or β Leonis, which are abbreviated Beta Leo or β Leo. Denebola is an A-type main sequence star with 75% more mass than the Sun and 15 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. Based on parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the star is at a distance of from the Sun. Its apparent visual magnitude is 2.14, making it readily visible to the naked eye. Denebola is a Delta Scuti type variable star, meaning its luminosity varies very slightly over a period of a few hours.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;β Leonis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Leonis&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. In Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; (1603), it was designated β (Beta) as the second-brightest star in the constellation. It also bears the Flamsteed designation of &quot;94 Leonis&quot; (assigned on the basis of increasing right ascension rather than luminosity) and additional designations followed as the star was recorded in subsequent star catalogues.

The traditional name &quot;Denebola&quot; is shortened from &#x27;, from the Arabic phrase &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;tail of the lion&#x27;, as it represents the lion&#x27;s tail, the star&#x27;s position in the Leo constellation. (Deneb in Cygnus has a similar name origin.) In the &quot;Alphonsine Tables&quot; it was recorded as Denebalezeth. On R. A. Proctor&#x27;s 1871 star chart of the Northern Hemisphere it was designated &quot;Deneb Aleet&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Denebola&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

15th century astronomer Ulugh Beg, gives the name &quot;Al Ṣarfah&quot;, the Changer (i.e. of the weather), as the star&#x27;s individual title. Al-Biruni, a Muslim scholar and polymath of the 11th century, wrote of it: &quot;The heat turns away when it rises, and the cold turns away when it disappears.&quot;

Ancient Chinese astronomers designated it the first star of the five-star asterism &quot;Seat of the Five Emperors&quot;, hence its Chinese name 五帝座一 (&quot;Wǔdìzuò-yī&quot;).

In Hindu astronomy, Denebola corresponds to the Nakshatra (a sector along the ecliptic) named &quot;Uttara Phalgunī&quot; (second reddish one).

Denebola, along with Spica and Arcturus, is part of the Spring Triangle asterism, and by extension, also of the Great Diamond together with the star Cor Caroli.

==Properties==
Denebola is a relatively young star with an age estimated at less than 400 million years. Interferometric observations give a radius that is about 173% that of the Sun. Its high rate of rotation results in an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge. It has 75% more mass than the Sun, which results in a much higher overall luminosity and a shorter life span on the main sequence.

Based upon the star&#x27;s spectrum, it has a stellar classification of A3 Va, with the luminosity class &#x27;Va&#x27; indicating this is a particularly luminous dwarf, a main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of Denebola&#x27;s outer envelope is about , which results in the white hue typical of A-type stars. Denebola has a high projected rotational velocity of 128 km/s, which is of the same order of magnitude as for the very rapidly rotating star Achernar. The Sun, in comparison, has an equatorial rotation velocity of 2 km/s. This star is believed to be a Delta Scuti variable star that exhibits fluctuations in luminosity of 0.025 magnitudes roughly ten times per day.

Denebola shows a strong infrared excess, indicating there is a circumstellar debris disk of cool dust in orbit around it. This dust has a temperature of about . Observations with the Herschel Space Observatory have provided resolved images, which show the disk to be located at a mean radius of 39 astronomical units from the star. As the Solar System is believed to have formed out of such a disk, Denebola and similar stars such as Vega and Beta Pictoris may be candidate locations for extrasolar planets.

Kinematic studies have shown that Denebola is part of a stellar association dubbed the IC 2391 supercluster. All the stars of this group share a roughly common motion through space, although they are not gravitationally bound. This suggests that they were born in the same location, and perhaps initially formed an open cluster. Other stars in this association include Alpha Pictoris, Beta Canis Minoris and the open cluster IC 2391. In total more than sixty probable members of the group have been identified.

<doc id="1118070" wikidata="Q415644" url="?curid=1118070" title="Brazilianite">
<text>Brazilianite, whose name derives from its country of origin, Brazil, is a typically yellow-green phosphate mineral, most commonly found in phosphate-rich pegmatites.

It occurs in the form of perfect crystals grouped in druses, in pegmatites, and is often of precious-stone quality. One noted deposit of brazilianite is in the surroundings of Conselheiro Pena, in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

Some of these are found on leaves of muscovite with their strong silvery glitter, ingrown in their parent rock. The crystals, dark greenish-yellow to olive-green, sometimes measure up to in length and in width. Crystals of similar shape and dimensions have been discovered in another deposit in Minas Gerais, near Mantena, but they lack the perfection of the crystal form. Many brazilianite specimens found in mineral collections originated from the Palermo and the Charles Davis mines in Grafton County, New Hampshire.

== Composition ==

Brazilianite, NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4 is a hydrous sodium aluminium phosphate that forms through the metasomatic alteration of amblygonite-montebrasite. Amblygonite, LiAlPO4F in combination with quartz goes through an OH-F exchange to make montebrasite, LiAlPO4{F,OH} at temperatures greater than 480 °C. Natromontebrasite, NaAl(PO4)(OH), is formed when montebrasite does though Li-leaching process and there is a Na cation exchange at temperatures less than 450 °C. Brazilianite concludes this process by forming as natromontebrasite combines with fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. Due to its formation caused by the amblygonite-montebrasite alteration and the presence of tourmaline in the environment where brazilianite forms, different elements are present in the mineral such as P, Al, Fe, Mn, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Na, K, F, and Cl. There are many substitution possibilities in the brazilianite formula. Besides sodium, being replaced by any other element, iron can replace aluminium, and vanadates or arsenates can replace the phosphates.

== Structure ==

Brazilianite is composed of chains of edge-sharing Al-O octahedra that are linked by P-O tetrahedra with sodium in the cavity of the framework. The crystal structure of brazilianite is a~11.23 Å, b~10.14 Å, c~7.10 Å, β~97.4° and Z = 4. The Al-octahedra has two types of octahedral coordination: trans-AlO4(OH)2 and trans-AlO3(OH)3. The two phosphorus atoms in brazilianite are coordinated in a tetrahedral with four oxygen atoms each. The sodium atom is located within the P-O and Al-O polyhedral in an irregular cavity. The coordination of the sodium is best described as the uncommon seven-coordination. The presence of a hydrogen ion in the same cavity where a sodium ion is causes a repulsion between the two, forcing sodium to one side of the cavity so that is it more coordinated with oxygen than its other side. Gatehouse et al., 1974 described the four remaining hydrogen as being in a chain and contributing to the complexity of the structure but Gatta et al., 2013, gives a well define H-bonding scheme and how these hydrogen items confines in OH groups. One of the hydrogen in brazilianite splits to make a fifth hydrogen. The splitting of this hydrogen has not been explained why it happens but it was shown that it can affect the hydrogen bond configuration. Some of the oxygen atoms in the four OH groups in brazilianite act as donors and some as acceptors of the hydrogen bond. One of these oxygen items is both a donor and acceptor to accommodate the hydrogen that split into two.

== Physical properties ==

Brazilianite is a mineral in the monoclinic system that is part of the point group 2/m and belongs to the space group P21/n. The crystals of brazilianite are elongated and prismatic along [100]. Most common forms that are measured in brazilianite {010}, {110}, { 11}. It displays a perfect cleavage on (010), it is brittle and has a conchoidal fracture. The mineral has a Mohs hardness of 5.5 and was believed it had a specific gravity of 2.94 which was first determined by Pough and Henderson, 1945. With the second occurrence of the mineral, it was determined that the specific gravity of the mineral was actually 2.98. Brazilianite has a vitreous luster, has a white streak, and the mineral is translucent to transparent. The color of brazilianite ranges from dark yellow-green to a pale yellow. Brazilianite begins to lose its color when heated to 200 °C and becomes colorless when it is heated to 300 °C.

== Geological occurrence ==
Brazilianite is typically found in granite pegmatite and it is often found within the cavities within the pegmatite where quartz, beryl and mica are also found. Different habits of brazilianite have been found in different locations. Brazilianite is often found with muscovite. The Corrego Frio pegmatite where brazilianite is found in Brazil is an altered pegmatite dike that had weathered biotite schist between its walls. In New Hampshire, the pegmatite where the brazilianite was found was made up of 99 percent albite, mica, and quartz. Brazilianite also found with tourmaline and feldspar. The sequence of the mineral formation in the pegmatite in Brazil had not been determined. The sequence of mineral formation in New Hampshire was quartz, brazilianite, apatite, whitlockite, and quartz. During the hydrothermal stage, the pegmatite containing the brazilianite is traversed by a late stage low temperature hydrothermal veins where amblygonite-montebrasite is altered to form brazilianite. Brazilianite has been described from other granite pegmatites in Brazil and the United States. It has also been found in different locations in the world, including Rwanda, Yukon Creek in Canada, Argentina, China, France, and Australia.

== Special characteristics ==
Brazilianite is sometimes used as a gemstone.
Brazilianite is relatively new phosphate minerals along with amblygonite, turquoise and apatite that are used as gemstones. Brazilianite is often confused with amblygonite, apatite, chrysoberyl, beryl, and topaz. Even though it was first described in 1945, its discovery was actually in 1944 but it was believed it was chrysoberyl until analysis was done to the mineral indicating a new mineral. The State of Minas Gerais is the largest producer and exporter of gemstones in Brazil and is accountable for 74 percent of the official production which includes brazilianite. It is soft and fragile causing it not to be a popular stone. When brazilianite is heated, it loses it yellow color and becomes colorless.

<doc id="1118076" wikidata="Q1066160" url="?curid=1118076" title="Zippeite">
<text>Zippeite is a hydrous potassium uranium sulfate mineral with formula: K4(UO2)6(SO4)3(OH)10·4(H2O). It forms yellow to reddish brown monoclinic-prismatic crystals with perfect cleavage. The typical form is as encrustations and pulverulent earthy masses. It forms as efflorescent encrustations in underground uranium mines. It has a Mohs hardness of 2 and a specific gravity of 3.66. It is strongly fluorescent yellow under ultraviolet light and is moderately radioactive.

==Historical usage==
A mineral which caught the attention of a Bohemian metallurgist, Adolf Patera, in the 1850s by its striking colour. It was named after the Austrian mineralogist Franz Xaver Maximilian Zippe (1791–1863). This was during the period when the fame of the Jachymov silver mines was dying out. On top of the large, forgotten pit-heaps, powdery minerals began to appear, vividly coloured, originating from the decomposition of the pitchblende. These colourful layers, in which zippeite was in the majority, gave Patera the idea of utilizing the uranium minerals in the manufacture of paints. Mining began in 1859 not only for the products which resulted from uraninite&#x27;s decomposition, but for uraninite itself. A variety of yellow paints were manufactured because among all the secondary minerals on the pit-heap there was a prevalence of the yellow powdery coatings.

Zippeite is one of the so-called &#x27;uranium ochres&#x27;. It occurs in association with uranopilite, a monoclinic, complex water-soluble alkaline with other secondary uranium minerals in the weathered veins of uranium. Apart from Jachymov in Bohemia it occurs mainly near Wölsendorf in Bavaria (Germany) and also in the US states of Utah and New Mexico. Zippeite is no longer used for the manufacture of paints, but is still used as a source of depleted uranium.

<text>Natun Asom Gana Parishad (&#x27;New Assamese People&#x27;s Association&#x27;) was a political party in the Indian state of Assam. NAGP was formed through a split of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP).

NAGP was led by former Union Law Minister and MP Dinesh Goswami and former Assam Home Minister Bhrigu Kumar Phukan. Goswami and Phukan had been prominent leaders of the Assam Agitation led by All Assam Students Union and All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad in the early 1980s. Other prominent leaders of the party included former Assam Education Minister Brindaban Goswami and former Assam Legislative Assembly speaker Pulakesh Barua.

In 1994, NAGP merged with AGP with Bhrigu Phukan as the Working President of the Asom Gana Parishad. Phukan was later removed from the post of party Working President and was finally expelled from AGP in 1997 following differences with party president and the then Chief Minister of Assam Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. Another leader of NAGP, former state Education minister Brindaban Goswami later on became the president of AGP.

<text>Vicente Rojo Lluch (8 October 1894 – 15 June 1966) was Chief of the General Staff of the Spanish Armed Forces during the Spanish Civil War. He is considered to have been one of the best commanders of the civil war.

==Early life==
He was the posthumous son of a military man who fought against the Carlists and in the campaigns of Cuba, from where he returned ill.

In 1911 Rojo entered the Infantry Academy at the Alcazar of Toledo, receiving his commission in 1914 with the rank of second lieutenant, fourth in a class of 390 cadets. After having been assigned to Barcelona he went on to the Group of Regulars from Ceuta (the &quot;Regulares&quot; were Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers). He was later posted back to Barcelona and to La Seu d&#x27;Urgell.

In 1922, having risen to the rank of captain, he returned to the Infantry Academy in Toledo, where he occupied diverse educational and administrative positions. He was one of the editors of the curricula on the subjects of &quot;Tactics&quot;, &quot;Weaponry&quot; and &quot;Firepower&quot; for the new section of the Military Academy of Zaragoza. In this period at the Academy he collaborated on the foundation and direction of the Military Bibliographical Collection, along with captain Emilio Alamán.

In August 1932, he left the Academy to enter the Superior War School with the objective to make the course of the General Staff. During his time at the academy, a peculiar event took place in which he proposed to the cadets a tactical assumption that consisted of passing through the river Ebro to establish a route in the Reus-Granadella, an operation very similar to one a few years later, during the civil war, he would later put into practice in the famous Battle of the Ebro in the area between Mequinenza and Amposta. He was promoted to major on 25 February 1936.

== Spanish Civil War ==
When the Civil War started (July 1936), Rojo - a devout Catholic, and linked to the conservative Unión Militar Española - stayed loyal to the Republican Government and was one of the military professionals who participated in the reorganization of the Spanish Republican Army.

In October 1936 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was designated head of the General Staff of the Forces of Defense commanded by General Jose Miaja, head of the Junta de Defensa de Madrid created to defend the capital at all costs after the transfer of the Republican government from Madrid to Valencia. In this capacity he prepared an effective defense plan for the city that prevented its fall. Afterwards, his fame as an organizer increased. As head of the Central Army HQ, he demonstrated outstanding performance in the planning of the main operations developed by the mentioned Army, in the battles of Jarama, Guadalajara, Brunete and Belchite.

On 24 March 1937 he was promoted to colonel, and after the formation of the Negrín government in May, was made Head of the General Command Staff of the Armed Forces and head of the General Staff of the Ground forces. From this new position he was in charge of directing the expansion of the People&#x27;s Army, and created the denominated Mobile Army, that served as the offensive advance force of the Republican Army.

On 22 September 1937 he was promoted to the rank of general. Throughout that year he planned the offensives of Huesca, Brunete, Belchite, Zaragoza and Teruel. He was awarded the highest Republican decoration, the &quot;Placa Laureada de Madrid&quot; on 11 January 1938 for his planning of the last mentioned operation.

The most ambitious operation he carried out throughout 1938 was the offensive of the Ebro, a plan that grew from the previously mentioned tactical assumption developed in the Superior War School, that gave rise to the long running battles of the Ebro that developed from 25 July to 16 November 1938. In these battles the Republic gambled its international prestige, its endurance and the possibility of being able to give a favorable turn to the course of the war. In December 1938 he planned an offensive in Andalusia and Extremadura in order to halt the Nationalist offensive against Catalonia, but the generals Matallana and Miaja rejected the plan and the offensive didn&#x27;t start until January 1939 and failed.

== Exile ==
After the fall of Catalonia, in February 1939, he moved with the government to France, where on 12 February 1939 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, only the second one in the Republican army.

After a brief stay in that country, the Service of Emigration of Spanish Republicans (SERE) paid his passage to Buenos Aires. Between 1943 and 1956 he taught as a professor at the military school of Bolivia.

Rojo has been considered one of the most prestigious military officers of the Republic, and of the war as a whole. His figure was respected even by his Nationalist opponents. The most surprising homage is Francisco Franco&#x27;s portrayal of him in the film &quot;Raza&quot;.

== Return to Spain and death ==
In February 1957 he returned to Spain, where most of his family already lived. This return was made possible through a series of negotiations which involved several Nationalist military officers in Madrid, F. José Luís Almenar Betancourt S.J., a Jesuit who was in contact with him during his stay in Bolivia, and the Bishop of Cochabamba, a former military chaplain who had served under Rojo.

Although he was not bothered in the beginning by the Francoist authorities, on 16 July 1957 the &quot;Special Court for the Repression of Masonry and Communism&quot; informed him that he would be prosecuted for the crime of military rebellion, in his position as ex-commander of the Army. This was the customary charge for professional military officers who had not joined the rebels in 1936. At his trial, Rojo was asked if he&#x27;d ever considered joining the rebels. He replied that he&#x27;d thought about doing so more than once for &quot;sentimental reasons&quot;, but remained loyal to the Republic out of a sense of obligation.

He was sentenced to 30 years, but did not serve a single day as the sentence was suspended, and he was soon pardoned. Franco held Rojo in such high esteem that he granted him the pension due a Lt. General of the Spanish army upon his return to Spain. A number of nationalist officers have publicly said that if Rojo had been allowed to conduct operations without the interference of Soviet officers, the outcome of the war might have been different. (&quot;Franco: The Man and his Nation&quot;; George Hills. Macmillan Company (1967).

Vicente Rojo died at his home in Madrid on 15 June 1966. Of the obituaries appearing in the Spanish press, only the one in &quot;El Alcázar&quot;, – mouthpiece of the Francoist ex-combatants – and the one by noted Falangist writer Rafael Garcia Serrano in the party press, amply eulogized his military achievements.

He wrote several books detailing his military experiences in the civil war, which were published in the following order: &quot;¡Alerta a los pueblos!&quot; (1939), &quot;¡España heroica!&quot; (1961) and &quot;Así fue la defensa de Madrid&quot; (1967).

<doc id="1118081" wikidata="Q13084" url="?curid=1118081" title="Dubhe">
<text>Dubhe is a multiple star system in the northern constellation of Ursa Major. It is formally designated Alpha Ursae Majoris, Latinised from α Ursae Majoris, Despite being designated &quot;α&quot; (alpha), it is the second-brightest object in the constellation. Alpha Ursae Majoris is the northern of the &#x27;pointers&#x27; (or &#x27;guards&#x27;), the second being Beta Ursae Majoris, or &#x27;Merak&#x27; – this pair of stars point towards Polaris, the North Star. α Ursae Majoris is located at a distance of approximately 123 light years from the Sun, based on parallax measurements.

Although it is part of the constellation of Ursa Major, it is not part of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that have a common motion through space.

==Components==
This is a spectroscopic binary made up of the stars designated &quot;α Ursae Majoris A&quot; and &quot;α Ursae Majoris B&quot;. The pair orbit at a separation of about 23 astronomical units (AU) with a period of 44.5 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.44. There is another spectroscopic binary at an angular separation of 7.1 arcminutes, forming a 7th magnitude pair showing an F8 spectral type with an orbital period of 6.035 days and an eccentricity of 0.09. It is sometimes referred to as Alpha Ursae Majoris C, but is separately catalogued as HD 95638. Together they form a quadruple star system.

Component A is the system&#x27;s primary, and it has a stellar classification of K0III. This is a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence after consuming the hydrogen at its core. It is 280 million years old with 3.7 times the Sun&#x27;s mass and has expanded 26 times the radius of the Sun. The star is radiating 340 times the luminosity of the Sun from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,650 K. The secondary star, component B, is an A-type main-sequence star that has a class of A5V. α Ursae Majoris has been reported to vary in brightness by about a thousandth of a magnitude. Ten radial oscillation modes have been detected, with periods between 6.4 hours and 6.4 days.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;α Ursae Majoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Ursae Majoris&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Dubhe&quot;, which is derived from the Arabic for &#x27;bear&#x27;, , from the phrase &quot;&quot; &#x27;the back of the Greater Bear&#x27;. The ancient Egyptians called it &quot;Ak&quot;, meaning &#x27;The Eye&#x27;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Dubhe&quot; for the star α Ursae Majoris A.

The Hindus refer to the star as &quot;Kratu&quot;, one of the Seven Rishis.

In Chinese, Běi Dǒu, meaning &quot;Northern Dipper&quot;, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Ursae Majoris itself is Běi Dǒu yī, () and Tiān Shū, ().

==In culture==
Dubhe is the official star of the State of Utah.

&quot;Dubhe&quot; was a ship in the United States Navy. The Danish National Home Guard Navy ship MHV806 is also named&quot; Dubhe&quot;.

<text>Knebworth is a village and civil parish in the north of Hertfordshire, England, immediately south of Stevenage. The civil parish covers an area between the villages of Datchworth, Woolmer Green, Codicote, Kimpton, Whitwell, St Paul&#x27;s Walden and Langley, and encompasses the village of Knebworth, the small village of Old Knebworth and Knebworth House.

==History==
There is evidence of people living in the area as far back as the 11th century as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is referred to as Chenepeworde with a recorded population of 33 households and land belonging to Eskil (of Ware), a thegn of King Edward the Confessor. The name &#x27;Knebworth&#x27; may mean either the farm belonging to the 5th century Saxon Dane, Cnebba, or simply There is an alternative interpretation, though, that the name could instead have meant &#x27;village on the hill&#x27;. The spelling of the name &#x27;Chenepeworde&#x27; has since changed to become the modern spelling of &#x27;Knebworth&#x27;.

The original village, now known as Old Knebworth, developed within the parish of the Church of St Mary and St Thomas. The stone church was built around 1120, and although the Domesday Book makes no mention of the church there is speculation to suggest there may have been a Saxon church of timber on the site before the more substantial one was built.

The manor passed into the hands of the Lytton family around 1492, when the manor house was rebuilt to a Late Gothic manor house. The house changed very little until the 19th century when it was re-modelled into the present-day Tudor Gothic building.

Knebworth was a largely agricultural community, producing wheat and barley in particular. The proximity to London via the Great North Road (subsequently the A1, and now the B197 since the opening of the A1(M) motorway in 1962) made it possible to transport produce.

By the start of the 19th century Knebworth had a population of around 250 people but the Industrial Revolution and the railway coming to Knebworth changed that. Initial development of the newer Knebworth village was centred a mile to the east of Old Knebworth on the area around the new railway station and the Great North Road. The route of the railway – which was originally meant to go through Codicote to the west – was negotiated by Lord Lytton so that it would go through the grounds of Knebworth, and have a station built there.  The Great Northern Railway, itself opened in 1850, opened a station at Knebworth in 1884. The station created a brand-new settlement called Knebworth Station – known later as New Knebworth, and later still, just as Knebworth – with the original village becoming known as Old Knebworth. Lord Lytton set up a company, Knebworth Garden Villages, to build homes either side of the railway embankment. Prior to this, only a few farmhouses had stood nearby, including Swangley&#x27;s farm and Deards End farm. The station site eventually grew to include a signal box and goods yard to the north, approximately where Kerr Close is now.

Migrants from London, neighbouring counties, and even more distant areas of the country came to work in the new settlement.

At the turn of the century the architect Edwin Lutyens built Homewood, south-east of Old Knebworth, as a dower house for Edith Bulwer-Lytton. Her daughter, the suffragette Constance Lytton, also lived there, until just before her death in 1923. Edith&#x27;s third daughter, Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton, had married Lutyens in 1897. Lutyens was responsible for a number of notable buildings in the new village of Knebworth as well, including the Bank, St Martin&#x27;s church, the Golf Clubhouse and the telephone exchange.

Knebworth has, since 1974, been famously associated with numerous major open air rock and pop concerts at Knebworth House. These include Knebworth Fair in 1976, featuring the Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd, which had an attendance of almost 250,000 as well as Queen&#x27;s final live performance which took place on 9 August 1986 and drew an attendance estimated at 125,000.

On 30 June 1990, Pink Floyd played at Knebworth. Nearly 31 years later, on 30 April 2021, this performance was released as a live album.

In 1996, Oasis played there to a quarter of a million people over two nights, for which 2.5 million people (4% of the British population) applied for tickets, a figure that could have led to 20 sold-out nights, and remains the highest recorded demand for a British concert to date. Most recently, for three nights in August 2003 Robbie Williams performed to the largest crowd ever assembled for a single performer.

<doc id="1118088" wikidata="Q5640912" url="?curid=1118088" title="Hal Roach (comedian)">
<text>Hal Roach (4 November 1927 – 28 February 2012) was a prominent Irish comedian. He spent over 60 years in show business as a live performer, having also recorded albums, DVDs and was featured in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for the longest-running engagement of a comedian at the same venue: 26 years at Jury&#x27;s Irish Cabaret, Jury&#x27;s Ballsbridge Hotel, Dublin. Despite having the same first and last name, he is not related to the pioneering comedy film producer of the same name known for his work with Laurel and Hardy, The Little Rascals, and Harold Lloyd. Coincidentally, both people of the same first and last name are known for comedy.

==Early life==
Born John Roche in Waterford, where he attended the Manor Christian Brothers school, Roche began his career after winning a local talent competition as a boy soprano. He initially toured with an illusionist and specialised in magic, but later moved to comedy.

==Comedy==
A typical Hal Roach joke is as follows: &quot;He told me that I have a cult following, at least I think that&#x27;s what he said&quot;.

Another-
&quot;There is a man sitting in the middle of the road casting his fishing line... now none of us is perfect, but c&#x27;mon! So I asked him, &quot;How many have you caught today?&quot; He said, &quot;You&#x27;re the ninth.&quot;

Perhaps his most famous catchphrase is &quot;Write it down, it&#x27;s a good one!&quot;.

He was a regular panelist on the 1970s RTÉ television show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; which was based on the original American version of the same name.

Roach has been cited as a major influence by other comedians such as Brendan Grace.

Roach was popular particularly with American tourists visiting Ireland. His act played heavily on traditional tourist imagery of Ireland and on Irish jokes. Several of his shows have been released on cassette and CD, and they are popular with tour bus drivers in several English-speaking countries who play them to passengers to help pass the time between destinations.

==Death==
After suffering from a long bout of ill health, Roach died on 28 February 2012. The following month, RTÉ broadcast a tribute to Roach in one of its graveyard slots, a repeat airing of a programme from the &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; series first broadcast in 1972.

<doc id="1118090" wikidata="Q2412078" url="?curid=1118090" title="The Icicle Works">
<text>The Icicle Works (also known as Icicle Works in the United States) are an English alternative rock band, named after the 1960 short story &quot;The Day the Icicle Works Closed&quot; by science fiction author Frederik Pohl. They had a top 20 UK hit with &quot;Love Is a Wonderful Colour&quot; (1983). In the US and Canada, they had one top 40 hit, the 1984 single &quot;Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)&quot;.

Consisting of singer/guitarist/keyboardist/songwriter Ian McNabb, drummer Chris Sharrock, and bassist Chris Layhe, the band released four albums from 1984 to 1988. The original band broke up in 1989, but McNabb has continued to perform under the Icicle Works name with various replacement members. After an absence of 35 years, Layhe rejoined the group in 2024; the current Icicle Works line up consists of Ian McNabb and Chris Layhe, who tour as an acoustic duo.

==History==
===1980–1983: Formation and early years===
The band was founded in Liverpool in 1980 when bassist Chris Layhe (who had been in a couple of local rock bands including Elanor and Blind Owl) answered an advertisement for a musical collaborator placed by 20-year-old Ian McNabb. The two got together and started writing. They added drummer Chris Sharrock (who had previously drummed for the Cherry Boys), and began playing live shows as &quot;The Icicle Works&quot;.

In 1981, the band recorded a six-song independently released cassette entitled &quot;Ascending&quot;. In 1982, they released the independent single &quot;Nirvana&quot;, which made it to No. 15 on the UK Indie Chart. The following year, the Icicle Works were signed to the Beggars Banquet label, who issued the single &quot;Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)&quot; on their subsidiary label Situation Two.

Later that year, The Icicle Works released their biggest UK hit, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Love Is a Wonderful Colour&quot;, which was a Top 15 single. Their 1984 eponymous debut album followed shortly thereafter, reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the US top 40. Appearing on the US top 40 singles chart at around the same time (and hitting the Canadian top twenty) was &quot;Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)&quot;, a retitled and slightly remixed version of the band&#x27;s Situation Two release of 1983.

===1984–1988: Touring years===
After the release of their self-titled debut album the Icicle Works struggled to match their initial commercial success. They continued to receive critical acclaim as a live band and secured a loyal fan base both in the UK and abroad.

In September 1984, the band issued the UK-only single &quot;Hollow Horse&quot;, which flopped (though it later became a live favourite in the band&#x27;s sets). A series of follow-up singles similarly missed the charts, including the Motown-flavoured &quot;All The Daughters&quot; and the folk-rock inspired &quot;Seven Horses&quot;. Added to the live line-up around this time was keyboardist Chris &quot;Tugsie&quot; Turrill; Turrill was not an official member of the band, and did not play on any of their recordings. Prior to Turrill&#x27;s arrival, both McNabb and Layhe had previously doubled up on instruments playing guitar, keyboard and percussion at live gigs. Layhe was often seen playing the octobans and McNabb occasionally played an open tuned guitar with his right hand and a keyboard with his left.

The band&#x27;s second LP, &quot;The Small Price of a Bicycle&quot; came out in mid-1985. The album was a UK-only release—their US label, Arista Records, dismissed the album as &#x27;punk-rock demos&#x27; and declined to release it. 
Beginning in 1986, though the band was still officially a trio, keyboardist Dave Green became an auxiliary member of The Icicle Works, replacing Turrill. Green both played at live shows and contributed to the band&#x27;s recordings.

In early 1986, Beggars&#x27; Banquet compiled all the 12&quot; mixes of the band&#x27;s singles onto a UK-only LP entitled &quot;Seven Singles Deep&quot;, which hit No. 52 on the UK Albums Chart.

In July 1986, The Icicle Works had a UK chart hit with the almost punk-sounding &quot;Understanding Jane&quot;, which peaked at No. 52. The song was later covered by The Wildhearts on their 2008 covers album &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard It Before, vol. 1&quot;.

The pop-oriented follow-up single &quot;Who Do You Want For Your Love&quot; peaked at No. 54, and January 1987&#x27;s &quot;Evangeline&quot; peaked at No. 53. All three songs found their way on to the 1987 album &quot;If You Want to Defeat Your Enemy Sing His Song&quot;, produced by Ian Broudie. The album was released in both Britain and North America and hit No. 28 on the UK Albums Chart.

Later in 1987, The Icicle Works issued the single &quot;High Time&quot;. It peaked at No. 76 in the UK, but in 1988 it hit No. 13 on the newly created US Modern Rock chart.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Blind&quot;, was produced by McNabb and issued in 1988, and reached the Top 40 of the album chart. The album featured 13 tracks in the UK and Canada, but the US version of the album featured a different track listing, slightly edited versions of a few songs, and a different cover. Still, both versions of the album contained &quot;High Time&quot; and the minor British hit &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;, which peaked at No. 59.

===1989–1991: New line-up and split===
By the late 1980s, tensions within the group were increasing, allegedly due to McNabb&#x27;s controlling ways. By 1988, in addition to writing virtually all of The Icicle Works&#x27; material (as well as singing and playing guitar) McNabb was producing the group&#x27;s records.

Shortly after &quot;Blind&quot; was issued, drummer Chris Sharrock departed to The La&#x27;s. Sharrock would later join The Lightning Seeds and World Party, and would drum for Robbie Williams, Del Amitri, Eurythmics, Oasis and Beady Eye. As of 2018 he is the drummer for Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds. Layhe also departed at this time. Beggars Banquet subsequently dropped the group from their roster.

McNabb continued to perform under the name The Icicle Works for a while. Dave Green was promoted to official membership status, although he left the band within a year. Zak Starkey was added on drums for a time, and various keyboardists, bassists, and guitarists passed through before the band released their final album &quot;Permanent Damage&quot; (1990), recorded for Epic/Sony. By that time, the band&#x27;s line-up was McNabb, bassist Roy Corkill, former 10cc and Jethro Tull drummer Paul Burgess, keyboardist Dave Baldwin, and backing vocalist Mark Revell. 

&quot;The reason Permanent Damage was an Icicle Works album was because Muff Winwood, who signed me to Epic, wanted a brand name that he knew was dependable, and wasn’t very keen on me just becoming Ian McNabb. But it was effectively a solo album.&quot; - Ian McNabb/

This &#x27;second-generation&#x27; version of The Icicle Works broke up after &quot;Permanent Damage&quot; failed to chart, and Epic dropped the band. McNabb&#x27;s solo career officially began in 1991 with the release of the single &quot;Great Dreams of Heaven&quot;.

In 1992, a compilation called &quot;The Best of The Icicle Works&quot; was released, containing the best of their work from the Beggars Banquet years. Two years later, a live recording of a 1987 concert was issued.

===2006–present: Revival===

After having been a solo act for 15 years, in 2006 McNabb reactivated The Icicle Works name for a series of six UK concerts in October of that year. This version of the band consisted of McNabb, former &#x27;second-generation&#x27; Icicle Works bassist Roy Corkill, and two new members: keyboard player Richard Naiff and drummer Mathew Priest, both of McNabb&#x27;s long-time solo touring band.

The Icicle Works appeared at GuilFest 2007 and played a nine-date UK tour in December 2007. McNabb and company played two free shows as &#x27;The Icicle Works&#x27; in Liverpool in January 2008.

McNabb continued to play gigs as a solo artist throughout 2009 and 2010. After a three-year hiatus from performing, The Icicle Works played a series of 30th Anniversary gigs in 2011. Gigs took place sporadically through the rest of the decade, before group activity wound down temporarily in 2022.

In 2024, Layhe officially rejoined The Icicle Works after a 35-year absence. Now consisting solely of McNabb and Layhe, the band undertook a series of acoustic gigs performing as a duo.

Roy Corkill died in August 2024.

<doc id="1118092" wikidata="Q4354752" url="?curid=1118092" title="Static (DC Comics)">
<text>Static (Virgil Ovid Hawkins) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Milestone Comics founders Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, Derek T. Dingle, and Christopher Priest. The character first appeared in a 3-page preview in &quot;Icon&quot; #1 (May 1993) with his first full appearance in &quot;Static&quot; #1 (June 1993), written by McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III and illustrated by John Paul Leon. He is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans with superhuman abilities known as metahumans. Not born with his powers, Hawkins&#x27; abilities develop after an incident exposes him to a radioactive chemical called &quot;Quantum Juice&quot;, turning him into a &quot;Bang Baby&quot; (a sub-category of metahuman).

The character drew much inspiration and was in fact designed to represent a modern-era Spider-Man archetype. After the closing of Milestone Comics, Static was incorporated into the DC Universe and became a member of the Teen Titans.

Static has made numerous appearances in other forms of media. The character has been featured in various animated series, including &quot;Static Shock&quot;, a version of the storyline made slightly more suitable for a younger audience, as well as animated films and video games.

==Publication history==

An African-American teenager, Static was a key character of Milestone Comics, an independently owned imprint of DC Comics founded by Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, Derek T. Dingle, and Christopher Priest with a greater representation of minority heroes. Originally developed for Marvel Comics, Static would become a main staple of the Milestone line. When initially creating the first five characters for Milestone Comics, it was decided that Static should be a teenage hero, similar to Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man. Static&#x27;s civilian identity, Virgil Hawkins, was named after Virgil D. Hawkins, a black man who was denied entrance to the University of Florida&#x27;s law school due to his race in 1949. The character&#x27;s superhero identity was suggested by Priest (who co-developed the original Milestone bible with McDuffie), inspired by the song &quot;Static&quot; by James Brown.

The character was introduced in one of the first four titles of comic books published by Milestone in 1993. His early adventures were written by Dwayne McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III, and penciled by John Paul Leon. Virgil Hawkins was fifteen years old when he became Static. In the comics, Virgil&#x27;s family consists of his father, Robert, who works at Paris Island Hospital; his mother, Jean; and his sister, Sharon. Virgil attends Ernest Hemingway High School in the city of Dakota with his friends: Frieda Goren, Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Stone, Larry Wade, Chuck, Felix, and Daisy Watkins. In the guise of Static, Virgil eventually rescues &quot;Rick Stone&quot; from danger. Not unlike Spider-Man, the character has a propensity for witty banter and humor, especially when engaged with opponents. In addition, Virgil utilizes his knowledge of science and pop culture in various battles and scenarios as Static.

McDuffie described the character:&quot;Like any other awkward 15-year-old, Virgil Hawkins worries about pocket money, getting beaten up, and drugs. But recently, he&#x27;s had even &quot;more&quot; on his mind: stuff like his powers, his secret identity, and drugs. Because, when innocents are in danger, and Virgil can slip away from class, the geeky youth becomes Static, the dashing, adventurous superhero!&quot;

During the DC FanDome, Static voice actor Phil LaMarr stated:

A self-professed geek, Virgil is portrayed as avid comic book and video game fan, something that was retained for his animated incarnation. In the comics, Virgil regularly visits the local comic store, in addition to creating fan comics with his friends, and participates in HeroClix-style and other tabletop role-playing games. In addition, he has been shown to be an avid video gamer at several points in both his series and the Teen Titans. In the 2001 miniseries &quot;Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool&quot;, it is shown that at that point in time, Virgil is into collecting Pokémon cards and he likes Pikachu (the flagship Pokémon of the franchise and a fellow user of electricity).

In an interview, former &quot;Teen Titans&quot; writer Geoff Johns expressed interest in having Static as part of the team: &quot;I really wanted Static on the team, but there&#x27;s so much red tape there that every time I requested it DC said &#x27;not yet&#x27; and so I never got to have him&quot; and later stating he had plans for the character since &quot;Teen Titans #1&quot; (vol. 3). Any obstructions were eventually resolved and Static appeared in the &quot;Terror Titans&quot;, with his Milestone continuity folded in the mainstream &quot;New Earth&quot; continuity.

Static joined to the mainstream DC Universe where he would be added to the Teen Titans. Static made his first canonical DC Universe appearance in &quot;Terror Titans&quot; #4, battling Rose Wilson in the final round of the Dark Side Club Tournament.

Static was expected to receive his own series in 2011. The series was to be written by Felicia Henderson and drawn by Scott McDaniel, but was cancelled before the first issue could be released following the death of Static&#x27;s creator, Dwayne McDuffie. However, a very limited one-shot titled &quot;Static Shock Special&quot; was released in June 2011, written by Henderson and drawn by Denys Cowan. &quot;Batwoman&quot; artist JH Williams III provided the one-shot&#x27;s cover. A new series featuring Static titled &quot;Static Shock&quot; was launched in September 2011 as part of DC&#x27;s relaunch after the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event. The book is written by John Rozum and drawn by Scott McDaniel, who also co-wrote. As part of an effort to better integrate Static into the mainstream DCU, the title takes place in New York City rather than Dakota.

A new &quot;Static Shock&quot; digital comic series was released in February 2021.

==Fictional character biography==
===Dakota Verse===

Doused with an experimental chemical during a gang war he was caught up in, high school student Virgil Ovid Hawkins gains a variety of electromagnetic powers and becomes a costumed crusader against crime. Like most teenaged heroes in the Spider-Man mold, he is often overwhelmed by the combined responsibilities of his career as a superhero and typical adolescent problems.

A resident of the city of Dakota, Virgil first gained his electromagnetic powers at a huge showdown between the gangs of the city, when he hoped to get revenge on a gang member who had been bullying him. The authorities arrive and release tear gas with what they believe to be a harmless radioactive marker so that any gang members would not escape arrest. The cops do not know the marker had been further spiked with an experimental mutagen called Quantum Juice (Q-Juice). This event ultimately came to be known as the so-called &quot;Big Bang&quot;. Those who were exposed came to be referred to as &quot;bang babies&quot; because the Big Bang was their metahuman birth.

When the agency behind the experiment tried to capture him, he fights back, discovering that he has gained the ability to generate, manipulate, and control electromagnetism. Virgil names himself &quot;Static&quot; and, armed with his wits and powers, became a superhero. For the most part, Virgil keeps his secret from his family, but his friend, Frieda Goren, learns his identity when he attempts to protect her from becoming a prize in a small skirmish between gangs.

Virgil is aided by friends Rick Stone and Larry Wade. He shows romantic interest in his friend and confidante Frieda Goren, but she is involved with Larry Wade. He dates a girl named Daisy Watkins, but his &#x27;responsibilities&#x27; as Static interfere with their dates too many times and Daisy calls their relationship off. In &quot;STATIC SHOCK: Rebirth of the Cool&quot;, Virgil is involved with a girl named Madison, but Frieda ends up fighting with her over him.

Static confronts numerous bang babies and other super powered adversaries: Hotstreak, Tarmack, Holocaust, Commando X, Puff, Coil, Snakefingers, Rift, The Swarm, Dr. Kilgore, Rubberband Man, Brat-atat-tat, Prometheus, Run, Jump &amp; Burn, Boom Box, Powerfist, LaserJet, etc. Other Bang-Babies that Static has encountered include Virus, D-Struct and Hyacinth.

In the mini-series &quot;Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool&quot; it is revealed that Virgil has given up his superhero career as Static. He enjoys his time being a normal civilian again, but on occasion misses being a superhero where his friend and confidant Frieda gets him to begrudgingly admit.

Virgil eventually returns to his superhero persona after being persuaded by many of his fellow superheroes, including Blitzen and Hardware for one final battle.

After the final battle with a man named John Tower who is later revealed to have been the first and greatest superhero in the Milestone Universe, Virgil decides to fully return to his career as Static. Virgil then informs Frieda it likely won&#x27;t be on a full-time basis as it was before.

====Working with other heroes====
Later in the comic line, Static is aided by allies: the Shadow Cabinet, the Blood Syndicate, and DCPD officer Captain Summers, who has a big interest in police cases involving Bang-Babies. Static teams up with Page, the sidekick to Kobalt, to stop a maddened Bang-Baby who had become half-fly. Static takes a moment to scold Page, who, in his opinion, seems more concerned with making excuses over their initial meet up than what was more important, stopping the danger.

Static ends up joining the unofficial group called Heroes. Multiple superheroes come together to protect the town of Iberia from a dam break. Many innocent citizens perish, but the heroes are still recognized for their efforts in saving the survivors and doing what they could. Static appears among the group, quips &quot;You started the X-Men without me&quot;, and talks his way onto the team. Minutes later, the Shadow Cabinet, now corrupt, sends a death squad after a few of his newfound friends.

===DC Universe===
In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Orion kills his father Darkseid, destabilizing the multiverse. Dharma transfers the Milestone characters to the DC universe, altering history so that they always existed there. Following this, Static joins the Teen Titans.

====Return to Dakota====
Virgil finally decides to see his family again after learning that a deadly virus has been infecting citizens of Dakota, including Sharon. After returning home, Virgil reunites with his family as well as Frieda, and learns that his girlfriend Madison has left him during his absence. He discovers that whoever created the virus is also selling limited supplies of the vaccine, and attacks the lab where it is being made. Upon breaking into the facility, Static is surprised and knocked out by Holocaust.

After refusing to help Holocaust in his pursuits, Static is imprisoned in a specialized containment unit alongside Aquagirl, Wonder Girl, and Bombshell. Holocaust informs the heroes that he plans to kill them and weaponize their abilities to sell them, but is ambushed by the rest of the Titans before this can happen. Holocaust easily defeats them, only to be confronted by Cyborg, who has recruited former Titans Kid Flash and Superboy.

The three are able to hold off Holocaust long enough for Virgil and the others to escape, and ultimately the combined might of all ten Teen Titans is enough to defeat the villain once and for all. After this, Virgil reconciles with Frieda and tells her that he has tricked his family into believing that he has taken part in a quantum physics fellowship, thus giving him an excuse to live in San Francisco with the rest of the Titans. He also makes one last attempt to win back Madison, but she silently rejects him. After this, Virgil and the other Titans decide to head home, with Superboy and Kid Flash as members again.

After a mission to another dimension to rescue Raven, Virgil returns home to find that he no longer has his powers. Furious and scared over his situation, as well as his inability to help Miss Martian awaken from her coma, Virgil attempts to leave the Tower and return to Dakota. He is stopped by Cyborg, who tells Virgil that he will be of no help to anyone back home without his abilities, and tells him that he has arranged for Virgil to be taken to Cadmus Labs to find a way to get his powers back. Superboy offers to travel to Cadmus to support his friend, but Virgil tells him that the Titans need him now. Following a farewell breakfast, Static leaves for Cadmus, with Wonder Girl assuring him that he will always have a place on the team.

===The New 52===

Following &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Virgil and his family leave Dakota for New York after an unspecified tragic incident that, among other things, left his sister, Sharon, as two separate, identical entities. Hardware gives Virgil a new costume and modified flying disk, which enables the two to remain in contact despite living in different cities. Hardware also gives him an internship at S.T.A.R. Labs as an after school job; he has Virgil posing as a prodigy kid that he (in his civilian identity, Curtis Metcalf) had recruited from the Juvenile Court System, on a commuted sentence, as his cover-story. During his first major battle, Static defeats the villain, Sunspot, and earns the attention of a criminal syndicate known as the Slate Gang.

&quot;Static Shock&quot; was cancelled as of issue #8 as part of DC&#x27;s &quot;Second Wave&quot; of &quot;The New 52&quot; titles and replaced by an alternative title.

In &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, Virgil designs the cape and wing apparatus of Red Robin&#x27;s new costume while at S.T.A.R.

Later, while recuperating at S.T.A.R. Labs from a previous battle, the Titans seek Virgil&#x27;s help in curing Kid Flash, whose cells Virgil discovers are rapidly deteriorating as a result of an alteration of his powers. Virgil provides Kid Flash with a new costume (based on a personal sketch for a variant of the Flash&#x27;s costume) containing materials that realign his molecules while stabilizing his powers, saving Kid Flash in the process.

===2021 Milestone Returns===

&quot;Milestone Returns&quot; created a new version of Static, combining ideas from previous Static comics and the &quot;Static Shock&quot; TV series. Several villains original to the series - Ebon, Onyx, Shiv, and Talon - were incorporated into the comics, and pre-existing villains Puff and D-Struct were redesigned to resemble their animated counterparts. Additionally, Rick Stone was renamed Richie Foley and given his animated version&#x27;s powers and status as the superhero Gear. 
Starting in &quot;Milestone Returns&quot; Issue #0, which takes place on Earth-93 (also known as Earth-M), 16-year-old Virgil Hawkins goes to a Black Lives Matter protest in the city of Dakota with his friends Frieda and Daisy, where the police use unstable, untested tear gas created by Alva Industries, inadvertently causing the &quot;Big Bang&quot; and granting several people metahuman powers. Curtis Metcalf, a long-time employee of Alva Industries, anticipates Alva will blame him for the incident and goes into hiding. Virgil is found unconscious after the Big Bang and wakes up in the hospital, being watched by his parents and sister. While he is physically unharmed, he stays home from school, getting used to controlling his new powers.

When he returns to school two weeks later, he sees the school bully Francis Stone, now calling himself &quot;Hotstreak&quot;, harassing other students. Virgil uses his powers in front of other students to stop Hot-Streak, stopping well before an officer comes to intervene. When the officer comes to see what is going on, Hot-Streak says he slipped. Elsewhere in Dakota, a classmate of Virgil&#x27;s, Darius, livestreams about the people who have transformed, being called Bang-Babies by the media. Meanwhile, a man named Holocaust starts building an army of metahumans.

In &quot;Static: Season One&quot;, the day after Virgil&#x27;s fight with Hot-Streak, several students save for him and Virgil&#x27;s friends believe someone else fought the bully. Seeking revenge, Hot-Streak attacks Virgil at his home, lighting it on fire. Virgil successfully keeps the damage to a minimum and defeats Hot-Streak once more, but his family develop concerns over his powers while he fears having to fight Hot-Streak again. Virgil contacts Metcalf, having met him previously during an &quot;Inventors of Tomorrow&quot; event, during which the latter informs him of a storage locker he owns. As Virgil explores the locker, the police arrive, believing him to be Metcalf. He dons a mask and suit, grabs as many items as he can carry, and escapes the police. Arriving home, Virgil modifies the suit.

After being captured by government armed forces and joining them in exchange for immunity, Hot-Streak helps them kidnap several Bang Babies. Virgil attempts to stop them, but is stopped by Darius. Hot-Streak and Agent Jones attempt to take Virgil from his home, but his parents bar the pair from entering. With the neighborhood watching, Hot-Streak and Jones are forced to leave empty-handed. As Virgil resolves to rescue the captured Bang Babies, Sharon provides him with glucose tablets so he can re-energize and an emergency line to her. With help from Darius, Frieda, and Ritchie, Virgil finds the facility containing the Bang Babies and takes the name Static.

Upon entering the facility, Virgil fights Hot-Streak, but is able to defend himself and restrain the latter. After Darius locates the Bang Babies, Virgil frees them, but a separate group of Bang Babies hired by the government attempt to stop the breakout. They attack Static, but he defeats them, convincing them that they need to work together. Sending forces to stop him, Jones uses an intercom to warn Virgil to surrender, but Richie discovers the location of Jones&#x27; servers, allowing Virgil to overload them while the others escape.

Days later, the Hawkins family reluctantly approve of Virgil becoming a superhero, with Sharon providing him with an updated suit. As the media attempt to spin a story about the Bang Babies attacking the government, Virgil hijacks the signals and tells the truth of what happened.

==Powers and abilities==
Static&#x27;s powers allow him to control electromagnetic phenomena, in particular allowing him to manifest and manipulate both electrical and magnetic energy—Static&#x27;s powers could be best described as superconductor electromagnetism; the latter is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. Using electricity, Static can telekinetically manipulate objects and generate force fields.

Furthermore, Static is immune to psychic attacks due to his bioelectric field. He is highly intelligent and knowledgeable in pop culture.

Static also wields a &quot;Bō&quot;-staff and a special disc that he can levitate for transportation.

==Supporting characters==

Static has a number of supporting characters, from best friends Rick Stone, Larry Wade, and Frieda Goren to sometime love interest Daisy Watkins.

==Other versions==
Static appears as a major character in the 2010 limited series &quot;Milestone Forever&quot;, a project designed to detail the final fates of the Milestone launch characters prior to being entering DC&#x27;s continuity. In Static&#x27;s tale, Virgil is retired and pursuing a career in medicine. Rick (now known by his television moniker of &quot;Richie&quot;) is also now working as a director in Los Angeles, and is open about his homosexuality. Ten years later, Virgil has become a doctor, married Frieda, and has two children, Larry and Sadie, both of whom inherited his electrical abilities.

<text>Ernst Oswald Johannes Gotthard Gotthilf Westphal (Khalavha in Venda, South Africa, 1919 - Bredasdorp near Cape Town, South Africa, 27 November 1990) was a South African linguist and an expert in Bantu and Khoisan languages. From 1949 to 1962 he taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.

== Biography ==

Ernst Westphal was born at Khalava in Venda, the son of German Lutheran missionary parents. His father was Gotthard Westphal and his grandfather, also Ernst Westphal, was with his wife Wilhelmine the teacher and mentor of Solomon Plaatje. Already as a child E.O.J. Westphal was fluent in German, English, and Afrikaans, like many South Africans. His first and native language, however, was Venda, and as a child he was initiated into the partly secret Venda rites for young men.

He studied Zulu and Southern Sotho under Clement Martyn Doke at the University of the Witwatersrand and, after graduating in 1942, was a Lecturer there 1942–1947. He was lecturer in Bantu Languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London 1949–1962, where his best friend was Guy Atkins (the brother of Vera Atkins), also a scholar of African languages. Another friend and associate was Fenner Brockway. Westphal was Professor of African Languages in the School of African studies at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, from 1962 until his retirement in 1984, and was recognized as an authority on the click languages of the San people, the Khoisan languages, in many of which he was fluent. Rycroft has stated that Westphal spoke six major languages as a native, another six almost perfectly, and of the African languages two hundred or more spoken well. In Lisbon Westphal translated texts and inscriptions found in Mozambique from their original language into Portuguese on behalf of the Portuguese government, collaborating with Prof. de Almeida. Westphal&#x27;s doctoral thesis &quot;The Sentence in Venda&quot; (University of London, 1955) is said to have been based entirely on his own knowledge of the language, using no other source.

Westphal&#x27;s family has been deeply involved in the cultural life of South Africa for over a hundred years. His grandfather, Gotthilf Ernst Westphal, for example, saw the potential of the teenage Sol Plaatje, then a student at the Mission Station in Pniel, Northern Cape, and gave him private tuition. Among other contributions, Plaatje was a founder and first General Secretary of the African National Congress (ANC). Like E.O.J. Westphal, he possessed extraordinary linguistic gifts, and he was a polyglot.

Westphal was also one of the founders of SANCCOB (South African National Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds), the story of which is documented in Marie Philip&#x27;s book &quot;Gregory. Jackass Penguin&quot;, translated from the Afrikaans book by Marie Philip and Adèle Naudé: &quot;Gregory. Kaapse pikkewyn&quot;, 1971.

Westphal had three sons: Robin Peter, (1945-2015), Richard Geoffrey, (1948-1996), and Jonathan Westphal, born 1951. Prof. Westphal&#x27;s second wife Althea had originally taken his ashes from Africa to Zennor, Cornwall, England, to be buried at St Senara&#x27;s Church, but in the event he was buried in Port Appin, Scotland, near Glencoe, Highland. His tombstone carries the words, &quot;A True Son of Venda&quot;.

A Festschrift was posthumously published in his honour, &quot;African linguistic contributions: presented in honour of Ernst Westphal&quot;, edited by Derek F. Gowlett (Pretoria: Via Afrika, 1992).

==Bibliography==
Westphal published many scholarly articles and books, including:
* &quot;The Sentence in Venda&quot;, University of London, London School of Oriental and African Studies, 1955.
* &quot;Kwangari: An Index of Lexical Types&quot;, University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies, 1958.

<text>The Jharkhand Party (JP) is one of the oldest political parties in India. formed on 5 March 1949 by &quot;Marang Gomke&quot; Jaipal Singh Munda in Ranchi. The party grew out of the demand for a separate Jharkhand state.

The Jharkhand Party participated in the Bihar Legislative Assembly elections of 1952, 1957, and 1962. For more than 15 years, the Jharkhand Party was the only major opposition political party against the Indian National Congress in Bihar. In 1955, the Jharkhand Party submitted a memorandum for the creation of a separate state of Jharkhand to the States Reorganization Commission, but the state was not created for linguistic and economic reasons.

==Central Working Committee==

* National President = Enos Ekka
* Executive President = Ajit Kumar
* Principal General Secretary = Ashok Kumar Bhagat
* Executive President = Kiran Aind

==History==

In 1936, Jaipal Singh Munda was approached by Chhotanagpur Unnati Samaj&#x27;s leaders to be president of the organization. Singh changed the name of Chhotanagpur Unnati Samaj to Akhil Bhartiya Adivasi Mahasabha in 1939. Singh became president of Adivasi Mahasabha. At the Ramgarh session of Congress in 1940, he discussed with Subash Chandra Bose the need to form a separate Jharkhand state. Bose replied that such a request would affect the struggle for freedom. After the independence of India, the Adivasi Mahasabha re-emerged as the Jharkhand Party and it accommodated non-tribal people to achieve long-term goals. Singh is popularly known as &quot;Marang Gomke&quot; (meaning &#x27;Great Leader&#x27;) by the Adivasis of Chhotanagpur.

The party fared well in the 1952 elections, and got 34 out of 325 seats in Bihar Legislative Assembly, becoming a major opposition party.

The Jharkhand Party participated in the 1952 election and won 34 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. In 1955, the Jharkhand Party submitted a memorandum for creation of separate state to States Reorganization Commission, but the demand was not accepted because the region had many languages and tribal languages were in the minority. In 1957 and 1962 Legislative Assembly election, the winning candidates of the party reduced to 31 and 20 in subsequent elections.

Jaipal Singh was disappointed by the declining popularity of his party and rejection of its demand for a separate Jharkhand. In 1963 the Jharkhand Party merged with Indian National Congress. The merger was quite unpopular within the party ranks, and a number of splinter groups were formed, incliuding the All India Jharkhand Party, the Hul Jharkhand Party, and Veer Birsa Dal.

In 1967, N.E. Horo became an MLA of the Jharkhand Party from Kolibera by election.

In 1971, the Jharkhand Party was reorganized by Bagun Sumrai, who was elected president. Horo became general secretary of the party.

On 12 March 1971, the Jharkhand Party arranged the Jharkhand-Mang diwas agitations in front of the parliament.

In 1975, N.E. Horo was elected president of the party and Noren Hansda was elected general secretary.

In 1990, N.E. Horo was elected president, working president Lal Ranvijay Nath Sahdeo, Ashok Bhagat General Secretary in byniel conference.

2005 Anosh ekka elected kolebira vidhansabha election and becoming the cabinet minister and also rural development and transport minister of Jharkhand State, Anosh Ekka elected president and Ashok Bhagat Principal general secretary in general conference.

On 8 January 2009, Jharkhand Party candidate Raja Peter defeated sitting Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren by over 9,000 votes in presidency of Anosh Ekka and Shri Ashok Kumar Bhagat-Principal General Secretary.

<text>Gallagher and Lyle were a Scottish musical duo, comprising singer-songwriters Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle. Their style consisted mainly of pop, soft and folk rock oriented songs.

Their first recognition came in 1968, when they were signed by the Beatles to write for Apple Records&#x27; artists. They were founding members of the band McGuinness Flint and wrote the 1970 UK chart hit &quot;When I&#x27;m Dead and Gone&quot;. 

In 1972, they formed the duo Gallagher and Lyle, whose fifth album &quot;Breakaway&quot; charted well, the title track being a cover hit for Art Garfunkel in 1975, and it included the hit songs &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Stay with You&quot;. Don Williams took their song &quot;Stay Young&quot; to No. 1 on the US Country charts.

The duo split in 1980, but re-formed in 2010 and worked together on an intermittent basis, mainly as a live act, until 2018.

Gallagher and Lyle have worked, jointly and individually, on records with, among others, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Ronnie Wood, Joan Armatrading, Ralph McTell, Sandy Denny, Fairport Convention and Jim Diamond. Artists who have released Gallagher and Lyle songs include Bryan Ferry, Ringo Starr, Elkie Brooks, Fairport Convention, Art Garfunkel and Joe Brown.

==Career==
They joined forces in 1959, initially as members of a local Largs-based band, The Bluefrets. They began writing original material for the band, while Gallagher also co-wrote &quot;Mr Heartbreak&#x27;s Here Instead&quot; for Dean Ford and the Gaylords (later to become Marmalade). The duo issued a one-off single, &quot;Trees&quot; b/w &quot;In The Crowd&quot; under the name &#x27;Gallagher-Lyle&#x27; on UK Polydor 56093 in 1967. They also backed singer James Galt, a friend of theirs from Largs, on two singles for Pye Records that are now highly prized by northern soul collectors: &quot;Comes The Dawn&quot;/&quot;My Own Way&quot; and &quot;With My Baby&quot;/&quot;A Most Unusual Feeling&quot;. The first of these was composed by Gallagher, Lyle and Galt, while the second was written by, firstly, Lyle alone and secondly by Gallagher and Lyle. 

They were then signed by Apple Records where they wrote for one of the label&#x27;s most successful artists aside from The Beatles and Beatles-related acts, Mary Hopkin. Songs for Hopkin included &quot;Sparrow&quot;, &quot;The Fields of St. Etienne&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Jefferson&quot;. In 1970 Gallagher and Lyle were amongst the founders of McGuinness Flint, writing nine of the 11 songs on the group&#x27;s debut album, including the UK Singles Chart Top 5 hits &quot;When I&#x27;m Dead and Gone&quot; and &quot;Malt and Barley Blues&quot;, both of which were produced by Glyn Johns. They recorded a second album with McGuinness Flint, &quot;Happy Birthday Ruthy Baby&quot;, again writing most of the songs, before leaving to form the duo Gallagher and Lyle in 1972. 

Their first album as a duo, &quot;Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle&quot;, was produced by Glyn Johns and released on Capitol; they then signed to A&amp;M Records. They were to record three more albums with Johns, &quot;Willie and the Lapdog&quot;, &quot;Seeds&quot; and &quot;The Last Cowboy&quot;. Their fifth album &quot;Breakaway&quot; utilised US producer David Kershenbaum and it was with this release, in 1976, that they charted again, with the hits &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Stay With You&quot;, both of which reached Number 6 in the UK Singles Chart and also charted in the US.

Their mellow sound was only briefly in vogue and elusive further success (another minor hit in the UK was &quot;Every Little Teardrop&quot;) prompted their split in 1980, by which time three more albums had been issued: &quot;Love On The Airwaves&quot; (which went silver in the UK), &quot;Showdown&quot; and &quot;Lonesome No More&quot;. The last of these was issued on Mercury; a further album recorded for that label, &quot;Living On The Breadline&quot;, has never been released. The duo&#x27;s original version of &quot;A Heart In New York&quot;, which was to have been included on that set, appeared on 1991&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Heart On My Sleeve – The Very Best of Gallagher and Lyle&quot;.

Gallagher and Lyle sang and performed as members of Ronnie Lane and The Slim Chance Band on the hit single &quot;How Come&quot; and the ensuing album &quot;Anymore for Anymore&quot;, and they have worked, jointly and individually, on records with Mary Hopkin, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Ronnie Wood, Elkie Brooks, Joe Egan, Andy Fairweather Low, Gary Brooker, Dennis Coulson, Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup, Champion Jack Dupree, Joan Armatrading, Ralph McTell, Sandy Denny, Fairport Convention and Jim Diamond.

Other artists who have recorded Gallagher and Lyle songs include: Bryan Ferry, Colin Blunstone, Donavon Frankenreiter, Elkie Brooks, Fairport Convention, Fury in the Slaughterhouse, Joe Brown, Judith Durham, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Phil Everly, Ricky Nelson, Ringo Starr, Rita Coolidge, Status Quo, The Fureys, Lemon Jelly, and Jim Capaldi.

==Reunion==
The seeds for a reunion were sown in 2007 when both Gallagher and Lyle, as session musicians, appeared on an album by Canadian singer-songwriter Chris Tassone; this was recorded at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios. In April 2009, the two Scots attended the opening of the Largs Heritage Centre. The following year, the duo re-formed.

In October 2010 the pair staged two charity concerts in Largs in aid of Haylie House, a residential care home in the town. This was followed in June 2011 by &#x27;The Big Gig&#x27;, an all-star charity concert at Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowland nightclub, in which they performed alongside Midge Ure, Jim Diamond and Marti Pellow. In September of that year, the duo appeared at the outdoor MOARE Festival in Faversham, Kent, which was headlined by former Average White Band stalwart Hamish Stuart.

2012 saw Gallagher and Lyle undertake their first tour since 1979, consisting of 9 dates at 8 Scottish venues. Their two dates at The Green Hotel in Kinross, a large golf resort, earned them the Mundell Music Award for Best UK Performance of the year, to add to their Tartan Clef Award for Lifetime Achievement, which they had received in November 2010.

The soundtrack to the 2012 documentary film &quot;We Went To War&quot;, directed by Michael Grigsby and relating the stories of three Vietnam War veterans, features the song &quot;I Was A Soldier&quot;, which was written and performed by Gallagher and Lyle.

In March 2016, Gallagher and Lyle performed together at the Belfast Nashville Songwriters&#x27; Festival. In November 2016, the duo returned to The Green Hotel in Kinross for four concerts.

The summer of 2017 saw the duo perform as part of the &#x27;Byre at The Botanics&#x27; season in St Andrews, and also at the Belladrum Festival in Inverness and the Albany Theatre in Greenock.

In March 2018, the duo returned to Belfast to perform once more at the Belfast Nashville Songwriters&#x27; Festival. On 13 March 2018, it was announced on Facebook that Benny Gallagher&#x27;s and the duo&#x27;s fan pages were to be closed down; the duo has been inactive since then.

==Stage musical==
&quot;Caledonia USA&quot;, a musical based on the songs of Gallagher and Lyle, was staged in Largs in April 2016. Originally titled &quot;When I&#x27;m Dead and Gone&quot;, it was subsequently retitled after a new song written specially for the show by Gallagher and Lyle.

==References in popular culture==
&quot;When I&#x27;m Dead and Gone&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 British comedy-drama film &quot;East is East&quot;.

British chick-lit author Lisa Jewell&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;After The Party&quot; makes reference to &quot;I Wanna Stay With You&quot;.

The late British broadcaster Kenny Everett staged a visual interpretation of &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; on his BBC TV show in the early 1980s.

The Variety Club of Great Britain has used &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; to promote its Gold Heart Appeal.

British Electronic music duo Lemon Jelly sampled &quot;I Wanna Stay With You&quot; on the track &quot;&#x27;75 aka Stay With You&quot;, which is on their third studio album &#x27;64-&#x27;95.

NOTE: All the duo&#x27;s original studio albums for A&amp;M and Mercury, excluding the eponymous debut, were reissued on CD in 2004 by River Records.

Universal Music Japan reissued the duo&#x27;s first four albums as limited edition CDs (with excellent sound), including the debut, with bonus tracks in 2016, thus making the rare A&amp;M B-sides &quot;Joie De Vivre&quot; and &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; available on CD along with both sides of the duo&#x27;s Polydor single, &quot;Trees&quot; and &quot;In The Crowd&quot;.

<text>Vena () is a king in Hinduism, notorious for his wickedness and misrule. A descendant of the first Manu, he bans all worship, offerings, and sacrifices upon his accession. After denying all petitions to restore these practices, Vena is slain by sages with their consecrated blades of grass. He is succeeded by the legendary king Prithu, who springs from his right arm.

In the Rigveda (10.123), Vena is a personification of a celestial being, perhaps the rainbow. The name of the hymn is also &quot;Vena&quot;, as is the name of the author of RV 9.85.

== Genealogy ==

The Bhāgavata Purāṇa traces the origin of Vena as a descendant of Dhruva and Cākṣuṣa Manu.

Dhruva&#x27;s eldest son, Utkala, did not ascend the throne. So, Dhruva&#x27;s second son, Vatsara, was made the king. Vatsara married Svarvīthi, who gave birth to Puṣpārṇa, Tigmaketu, Iṣa, Ūrja, Vasu, and Jaya.

Puṣpārṇa married Prabhā and Doṣā. Doṣā gave birth to Pradoṣa, Niśitha and Vyuṣṭha. Vyuṣṭha married Puṣkariṇī, and gave birth to Sarvatejas, who had a son – Cākṣuṣa Manu, from his wife Ākūti. Manu and his wife Nadvalā had twelve sons. Ulkmuka, one of Manu&#x27;s sons, and his wife Puṣkariṇī (who had the same name as the wife of Vyuṣṭha) had six sons. Anga, one of Ulmuka&#x27;s sons, married Sunīthā, who gave birth to Vena.

The Padma Purāṇa mentions that Sunīthā is the ugly daughter of Mṛtyu (death), and hence Vena is regarded to have been wicked from birth.
== Legend ==

=== Origin ===
The Padma Purana states that Sunitha, Vena&#x27;s mother, was a cruel woman, who enjoyed hurting other people. Once, when she went to the forest to play with her maids, she saw a gandharva named Suśaṅkha. The handsome youth was engaged in a penance to propitiate the goddess of music, Saraswati. Sunitha started to annoy him, but Suśaṅkha resisted her attempts to distract him. Bitter that the youth was ignoring her, she struck him. Suśaṅkha was angered, but did not wish to strike a woman. Sunitha boasted of her lineage from Yama to him, but he was unimpressed. When Sunitha met Suśaṅkha again, she struck him with a whip. Furious, and shivering in pain, the youth cursed her thus: 
=== Birth ===
According to the Bhagavata Purana, once, when King Anga was performing the ashvamedha sacrifice, the deities did not accept his oblations, for he did not have a son. On the advice of sages, Anga performed another sacrifice and venerated Vishnu. From the sacrificial fire arose a person with milk-boiled rice (&quot;payasam&quot;). Anga fed the rice to his wife, Sunitha, who gave birth to a son. The son, from his childhood, was attached to his maternal grandfather Mrityu (a portion of Adharma), and turned to unrighteousness. He acted like a beast, ruthlessly hunting innocent deer. Seeing his wicked acts, he was named Vena, &#x27;the tormentor&#x27;. Unable to disciple his child, Anga lost his peace of mind, and left his kingdom in disgust, retiring to the forest. Fearing anarchy and thieves, the sages and the people crowned Vena as the king, even though they were dissatisfied with the prince.

=== Reign and death ===
When Vena became the king, the thieves immediately stopped their crimes and hid themselves. However, Vena proclaimed that in his kingdom, no one would perform a sacrifice, and that they would not spend a single coin on religious acts. He banned religion. The sages visited Vena&#x27;s court to conciliate the king, offering him wisdom about dharma (duty), moksha (salvation), and his responsibility as a ruler from the Dharmashastras. They asked him to restore the practice of sacrificial offerings and religious ceremonies. Vena declared their devotion towards Yajneshvara to be foolish, for he himself was the embodiment of all the deities. He commanded that all of his subjects worship him rather than any other being. Angered by the insult that the king had made towards their Brahmin birth, and the deity Vishnu, the sages slew him with consecrated blades of grass, while uttering the &quot;huṃ&quot; sound&quot;.&quot; A grieving Sunitha preserved her son&#x27;s corpse by chanting mantras and applying medicines.

=== Birth of Prithu ===
After the death of Vena, there was anarchy, since Vena had no sons and heirs. Thieves and evil men begun to plunder and steal from innocent people. Wishing to continue the line of Vena&#x27;s father, Anga, they kneaded the thigh of Vena, from which a dwarfish man appeared, with black features and blood-red eyes. The man bowed before the sages and asked them of his purpose. The sages told him to sit (&quot;niṣīda&quot;), after which he named himself&quot;.&quot; The man is said to have accepted all the sins committed by Vena unto himself. Thereafter, the descendants of the man came to be known as the Nishadas, dwelling in the Vindhya mountains.

The sages then began to knead the corpse’s right hand, from which a shining man, Prithu, bearing a divine bow, arrows, and armour appeared. The sages observed that Prithu had the mark of the Sudarshana Chakra, after which they identified him as a form of Vishnu. He was crowned as the new king, and went on to become a powerful ruler, restoring religious rites and sacrifices.

The people sought out Prithu, informing him that during the anarchy before his accession, the world had become so gloomy and dark that the earth-goddess, and incarnation of Lakshmi, Bhumi, had decided that she would not provide crops to humans anymore. She had taken the form of a cow and gone into hiding, making the earth empty of any vegetation. Furious, Prithu chased Bhumi through the three worlds, bearing his bow, Ajagava. When he finally cornered her, she pleaded with him to spare her. She allowed him and the sages to milk her, which restored the vegetation and vitality of the earth, as well as its people. Hence, Vishnu was able to make his consort restore her prosperity to the human race, as Prithu. Due to this reason, Bhumi acquired the epithet Prithvi.

<doc id="1118112" wikidata="Q863103" url="?curid=1118112" title="Billy Fury">
<text>Ronald Wycherley (17 April 1940 – 28 January 1983), better known by his stage name Billy Fury, was an English musician. An early star of rock and roll, he spent 332 weeks on the UK singles chart. His hit singles include &quot;Wondrous Place&quot;, &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot;. Fury also maintained a film career, notably playing rock performers in &quot;Play It Cool&quot; in 1962 and &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; in 1973.

AllMusic journalist Bruce Eder stated that Fury&#x27;s &quot;mix of rough-hewn good looks and unassuming masculinity, coupled with an underlying vulnerability, all presented with a good voice and some serious musical talent, helped turn [him] into a major rock and roll star in short order&quot;. Others have suggested that his rapid rise to prominence was due to his &quot;Elvis-influenced hip swivelling and, at times, highly suggestive stage act&quot;.

==Early years==
Fury was born Ronald Wycherley at Smithdown Hospital (later known as Sefton General Hospital, since demolished) on Smithdown Road in Liverpool on 17 April 1940. He commenced music lessons on the piano before he was a teenager and was bought his first guitar by the age of 14. Wycherley fronted his own group in 1955 but simultaneously worked full-time on a tugboat and later as a docker. He entered and won a talent competition and by 1958 had started composing his own songs.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wycherley went to meet pop manager and impresario Larry Parnes at the Essoldo Theatre in Birkenhead, hoping to interest one of Parnes&#x27; protégés, singer Marty Wilde, in some of the songs he had written. Instead, in an episode that has since become pop music legend, Parnes pushed young Wycherley up on stage right away. He was such an immediate success that Parnes signed him, added him to his tour, and renamed him &quot;Billy Fury&quot;.

However, his early sexual and provocative stage performances received censure, and he was forced to tone them down. In October 1959, the UK music magazine, &quot;NME&quot;, commented that Fury&#x27;s stage antics had been drawing much press criticism.

He released his first hit single for Decca, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, in 1959. He also appeared in a televised play &quot;Strictly for Sparrows&quot;, and subsequently on &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; In March 1960, he reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart with his own composition &quot;Colette&quot;, followed by &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot; and his first album &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (1960), which featured a young Joe Brown on lead guitar, with backup vocals by the Four Jays. After securing more hits and splitting from his band Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Parnes held auditions in Liverpool for a new group. Among those who auditioned were the Beatles, who at this time were still calling themselves the Silver Beetles. They were offered the job for £20 a week on condition that they sacked their bassist Stuart Sutcliffe. John Lennon refused and the band left after Lennon had secured Fury&#x27;s autograph.

===UK chart and film success===
Fury concentrated less on rock and roll and more on mainstream ballads, such as &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; (which reached No. 3 and No. 2 respectively in the UK Singles Chart in 1961). Fury confessed to the &quot;NME&quot; that &quot;I wanted people to think of me simply as a singer – and not, more specifically, as a rock singer. I&#x27;m growing up, and I want to broaden my scope. I shall continue to sing rock songs, but at the same time my stage act is not going to be as wild in the future&quot;. It was Decca&#x27;s decision to mould Fury into a teen idol after his last self-penned song, &quot;My Christmas Prayer&quot;, had failed to chart. The years 1961 through 1963 were Fury&#x27;s best years chartwise. In 1962, he appeared in his first film, &quot;Play It Cool&quot;, modelled on the Elvis films. It featured Helen Shapiro, Danny Williams, Shane Fenton and Bobby Vee, who appeared with the Vernons Girls. The hit single from the film was &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot;. There were other notable performances by several British actors and performers such as Richard Wattis, Lionel Blair and Dennis Price.

Fury&#x27;s &quot;We Want Billy!&quot; (1963) was one of the first live albums in UK rock history, and featured renditions of his hits and cover versions of several R&amp;B songs such as &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot;.

In 1965 he appeared in the film &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Horse&quot;, which also featured his backing group the Gamblers, the Bachelors, Amanda Barrie, Michael Medwin and Jon Pertwee. The album from the film was made available in stereo. Fury left Decca Records in 1966, after signing to a five-year recording contract with Parlophone.

Having had more UK hits, such as &quot;It&#x27;s Only Make Believe&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot; (written by Dick Glasser, not to be confused with the Paul McCartney song), both in 1964, and &quot;In Thoughts of You&quot; (1965), Fury began a lengthy absence from the charts in 1967, and underwent surgery for heart problems in 1972 and 1976 which led to his abandoning touring. Despite spending many weeks in the charts, Fury never achieved a number one single, but he remained popular even after his hits stopped. &quot;I Will&quot; became a US hit for Dean Martin (1965) and for Ruby Winters (1977).

===Later years===
In 1973, Fury emerged from a period of semi-retirement to appear as &#x27;Stormy Tempest&#x27; in the film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. The film starred David Essex and Ringo Starr; it was roughly based on the early days of the Beatles. Starr was from the Dingle area of Liverpool, as was Fury, and had originally played drums for Rory Storm &amp; the Hurricanes, whom the Stormy Tempest group were said to be modelled on.

In the mid-1970s, Fury went out on the road with Marty Wilde. Away from the spotlight, he focused on wildlife preservation. Fury&#x27;s health deteriorated and he underwent two open heart surgeries—the first in 1972 and the second in 1976. In 1978, Fury was declared bankrupt for unpaid taxes to the Inland Revenue. The taxes dated back to 1962, and amounted to £16,780. Fury was also forced to sign over his royalties and publishing income. A new release, &quot;Be Mine Tonight&quot; (1981), failed to make an appearance in the UK Singles Chart. Worse was to follow in March 1981 when Fury, working on his own farm, collapsed and almost died. He returned to touring later that year, and his next two singles, &quot;Love or Money&quot; and &quot;Devil or Angel&quot;, barely dented the UK chart.

In 1981 and 1982, Fury was signed to Polydor Records by A&amp;R man Frank Neilson, and he recorded a comeback album, &quot;The One and Only&quot; (released posthumously), with Shakin&#x27; Stevens&#x27; producer Stuart Colman. Owing to his health, Fury did little touring to promote the new album. His last public appearance was at the Sunnyside pub, Northampton, on 4 December 1982. A few days before he died, Fury recorded a live performance for the Channel 4 television show &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, featuring six of his old hits; however, at the request of his mother, only four of them were broadcast.

==Personal life==
Fury was a keen birdwatcher. He lived with businesswoman Lee Everett Alkin, better known as &quot;Lady Lee&quot; Middleton, from 1959 to 1967.

During this time, he had a short relationship with actress Amanda Barrie, his co-star in &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Horse&quot;. Fury went from Liverpool to London (like the Beatles) and he lived in Number 1 Cavendish Avenue, the same street as Paul McCartney. He is remembered and honoured with a Blue Plaque there.

Fury married Judith Hall in May 1969, but later left her for heiress Lisa Voice. They lived together in London, and sometimes on Fury&#x27;s farm in Wales, from 1971 until his death, although they were leading separate lives for the last two years.

==Death==

After returning from a recording session in the early hours of 28 January 1983, Fury collapsed from a heart attack at his home in London. His manager Tony Read found him unconscious the next morning. He was taken to St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Paddington, but died later in the afternoon, aged 42. Rheumatic fever, which he first contracted as a child, damaged his heart and ultimately contributed to his death. A week after his death, a funeral service was held at the St John&#x27;s Wood church in London, for which his body was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Among the mourners were Larry Parnes, Marty Wilde, Jess Conrad, Eden Kane, Tony Read, Hal Carter and Mick Green, in addition to family members, friends and fans. The choir sang a special version of Billy&#x27;s Decca hit &quot;I&#x27;m Lost Without You&quot;. After the service Fury&#x27;s body was buried at Mill Hill cemetery, in North London. A song issued posthumously entitled &quot;Forget Him&quot; became his final chart hit.
==Legacy==

In 1999, a TV documentary about Fury called &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; was broadcast on the BBC channel, narrated by Ian Dury. Between 1999 and 2000, the song &quot;Wondrous Place&quot;, a favourite of Fury&#x27;s (he re-recorded it at least three times during his career), later received wide airplay on British television when it was used as the theme for a Toyota Yaris car advertisement. In 2005, Spencer Leigh from BBC Radio Merseyside published a biography book about Fury called &quot;Wondrous Face – The Billy Fury Story&quot;. In 2008, a biographical documentary film &quot;Billy Fury: His Wondrous Story&quot; was released on DVD.

On 19 April 2003, a bronze statue of Fury was unveiled by Jack Good at the National Museum of Liverpool Life. The sculpture, by Tom Murphy, a Liverpool sculptor, was donated by &#x27;The Sound of Fury&#x27; fan club after the money was raised by fans.

In 2010, Camden Council named a previously unnamed alleyway &quot;Billy Fury Way&quot; in his honour. It starts just off Finchley Road near Finchley Road &amp; Frognal station and runs to West Hampstead Station. He had recorded at the nearby Decca Studios. The alleyway was decorated with a large mural of his face (at the West Hampstead end), which was unveiled and blessed on 29 July 2011.

Eight of Fury&#x27;s EMI recordings remained unreleased on mainstream CD until June 2010, when they appeared on a 29-track issue, &quot;The Complete Parlophone Singles&quot;, released by Peaksoft (PEA009). The singer&#x27;s estate licensed the tracks to benefit his memorial fund, which finances equipment purchases for hospital heart units. In November 2011, further co-operation between the estate and Peaksoft resulted in the issuing of a second CD, &quot;The Lost Album&quot; (PEA014), which attempted to construct the format of an album recorded by Fury in 1967–71, but which was never released.

Fury&#x27;s backing band from 1970 until 1976, when he stopped touring due to ill health, were Fury&#x27;s Tornados, named by Fury and his then manager Hal Carter. They continue to tour in the theatre show &quot;Halfway to Paradise: The Billy Fury Story&quot;. Fury is also remembered in the work of tribute bands such as another theatre show called &quot;The Billy Fury Years&quot;. The film &quot;Play It Cool&quot; was first released on DVD on 10 February 2014.

<doc id="1118119" wikidata="Q9397013" url="?curid=1118119" title="Exit pupil">
<text>In optics, the exit pupil is a virtual aperture in an optical system. Only rays which pass through this virtual aperture can exit the system. The exit pupil is the image of the aperture stop in the optics that follow it. In a telescope or compound microscope, this image is the image of the objective element(s) as produced by the eyepiece. The size and shape of this disc is crucial to the instrument&#x27;s performance, because the observer&#x27;s eye can see light only if it passes through the aperture. The term &quot;exit pupil&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the diameter of the virtual aperture. Older literature on optics sometimes refers to the exit pupil as the Ramsden disc, named after English instrument-maker Jesse Ramsden.

==Visual instruments==
To use an optical instrument, the entrance pupil of the viewer&#x27;s eye (the image of the anatomical pupil as seen through the cornea) must be aligned with and be of similar size to the instrument&#x27;s exit pupil. This configuration properly couples the optical system to the eye and avoids vignetting because the eye captures all of the rays exiting the instrument. The location of the exit pupil thus determines the eye relief of an eyepiece. Good eyepiece designs produce an exit pupil of diameter approximating the eye&#x27;s apparent pupil diameter and located about 20 mm away from the last surface of the eyepiece for the viewer&#x27;s comfort. If the disc is larger than the eye&#x27;s pupil, then light will be lost instead of entering the eye. If the disc is too close to the last surface of the eyepiece, then the eye will have to be uncomfortably close for viewing; if too far away, then the observer will have difficulty maintaining the eye&#x27;s alignment with the disc because there is no instrumental help to physically hold the eye position. 

Since the eye&#x27;s pupil varies in diameter with viewing conditions, the ideal exit pupil diameter depends on the application. An astronomical telescope requires a large exit pupil because it is designed to be used for looking at dim objects at night, while a microscope will require a much smaller exit pupil since an object being observed will be brightly illuminated. A set of 7×50 binoculars has an exit pupil just over 7.14 mm, which corresponds to the average pupil size of a youthful dark-adapted human eye in circumstances with no extraneous light. The emergent light at the eyepiece then fills the eye&#x27;s pupil, meaning no loss of brightness at night due to using such binoculars (assuming perfect transmission). In daylight, when the eye&#x27;s pupil is only 4 mm in diameter, over half the light will be blocked by the iris and will not reach the retina. However, the loss of light in the daytime is generally not a concern since there is so much light to start with. By contrast, 8×30 binoculars, often sold with emphasis on their compactness, have an exit pupil of only 3.75 mm. That is sufficient to fill a typical daytime eye pupil, making these binoculars better suited to daytime than night-time use. The maximum pupil size of a human eye is typically 5–9 mm for individuals below 25 years old and decreases slowly with age as shown as an approximate guide in the table here.

The optimum eye relief distance also varies with application. For example, a rifle scope needs a very long eye relief to prevent recoil from causing it to strike the observer.

The exit pupil can be visualized by focusing the instrument on a bright, nondescript field, and holding a white card up to the eyepiece. This projects a disc of light onto the card. By moving the card closer to or further away from the eyepiece, the disc of light will be minimized when the card is at the exit pupil, and the bright disc then shows the diameter of the pupil. A clear vial of milky fluid can be used to scatter light rays exiting the eyepiece, making their paths visible. These rays appear as an hourglass shape converging and diverging as they exit the eyepiece, with the smallest cross-section (the waist of the hourglass shape) representing the exit pupil.

==Telescopes==
For a telescope, the diameter of the exit pupil can be calculated by dividing the focal length of the eyepiece by the focal ratio (f-number) of the telescope. In all but the cheapest telescopes, the eyepieces are interchangeable, and for this reason, the magnification is not written on the scope, as it will change with different eyepieces. Instead, the f-number of the telescope is typically written on the scope, as well as the objective diameter D and focal length L. The individual eyepieces have their focal lengths written on them as well.

In the case of binoculars however, the two eyepieces are usually permanently attached, and the magnification and objective diameter (in mm) is typically written on the binoculars in the form, e.g., 7×50. In that case, the exit pupil can be easily calculated as the diameter of the objective lens divided by the magnification. The two formulas are of course equivalent and it is simply a matter of which information one starts with as to which formula to use.

==Photography==

The distance of the exit pupil from the sensor plane determines the range of angles of incidence that light will make with the sensor. Digital image sensors often have a limited range of angles over which they will efficiently accept light, especially those that use microlenses to increase their sensitivity. The closer the exit pupil to the focal plane, the higher the angles of incidence at the extreme edges of the field. This can lead to pixel vignetting. For this reason, many small digital cameras (such as those found in cell phones) are image-space telecentric, so that the chief rays strike the image sensor at normal incidence.

<doc id="1118120" wikidata="Q3305916" url="?curid=1118120" title="Non-blocking I/O (Java)">
<text>java.nio (NIO stands for New Input/Output) is a collection of Java programming language APIs that offer features for intensive I/O operations. It was introduced with the J2SE 1.4 release of Java by Sun Microsystems to complement an existing standard I/O. NIO was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 51. An extension to NIO that offers a new file system API, called NIO.2, was released with Java SE 7 (&quot;Dolphin&quot;).

==Features and organization==
The APIs of NIO were designed to provide access to the low-level I/O operations of modern operating systems. Although the APIs are themselves relatively high-level, the intent is to facilitate an implementation that can directly use the most efficient operations of the underlying platform.

The Java NIO APIs are provided in the package and its subpackages. The documentation by Oracle identifies these features. 
* Buffers for data of primitive types
* Character set encoders and decoders
* A pattern-matching facility based on Perl-style regular expressions (in package )
* Channels, a new primitive I/O abstraction
* A file interface that supports locks and memory mapping of files up to codice_1 bytes (2 GiB)
* A multiplexed, non-blocking I/O facility for writing scalable servers

===NIO buffers===
NIO data transfer is based on buffers ( and related classes). These classes represent a contiguous extent of memory, together with a small number of data transfer operations. Although theoretically these are general-purpose data structures, the implementation may select memory for alignment or paging characteristics, which are not otherwise accessible in Java. Typically, this would be used to allow the buffer contents to occupy the same physical memory used by the underlying operating system for its native I/O operations, thus allowing the most direct transfer mechanism, and eliminating the need for any additional copying. In most operating systems, provided the particular area of memory has the right properties, transfer can take place without using the CPU at all. The NIO buffer is intentionally limited in features in order to support these goals.

There are buffer classes for all of Java&#x27;s primitive types except codice_2, which can share memory with byte buffers and allow arbitrary interpretation of the underlying bytes.

====Usage====
NIO buffers maintain several pointers that dictate the function of their accessor methods. The NIO buffer implementation contains a rich set of methods for modifying these pointers:
* The codice_3 method, rather than performing a &quot;flip&quot; or paging function in the canonical sense, moves the &quot;position&quot; pointer to the origin of the underlying array (if any) and the &quot;limit&quot; pointer to the former position of the &quot;position&quot; pointer.
* Three codice_4 methods are supplied for transferring data out of a NIO buffer. The bulk implementation, rather than performing a &quot;get&quot; in the traditional sense, &quot;puts&quot; the data into a specified array. The &quot;offset&quot; argument supplied to this method refers not to the offset from within the buffer from which to read, nor an offset from the &quot;position&quot; pointer, but rather the offset from 0 within the target array.
* Unless using the absolute codice_4 and codice_6 methods, any codice_4 or codice_6 is conducted from the &quot;position&quot; pointer. Should one need to read from a different position within the underlying array, whilst not adjusting the &quot;writing&quot; position, the codice_9 and codice_10 methods have been supplied.
* The codice_9 method effectively stores the position of the &quot;position&quot; pointer by setting the &quot;mark&quot; pointer to the position of the &quot;position&quot; pointer. The codice_10 method causes the &quot;position&quot; pointer to move to the &quot;mark&quot; pointer&#x27;s position.
* Upon invocation of the codice_13 method or the codice_3 method the &quot;mark&quot; pointer is discarded.
* The codice_13 method does not ensure zero-ing of the buffer, but does return the &quot;limit&quot; pointer to the upper boundary of the underlying array, and the &quot;position&quot; pointer to zero.
* codice_6 and codice_4 operations for NIO buffers are not thread safe.
* You can only codice_18 a from a up to codice_1 in size (2GiB); regions beyond this limit can be accessed using an offset greater than zero.

===Channels===
Channels (classes implementing the interface ) are designed to provide for bulk data transfers to and from NIO buffers. This is a low-level data transfer mechanism that exists in parallel with the classes of the higher-level I/O library (packages and ). A channel implementation can be obtained from a high-level data transfer class such as , , or , and vice versa. Channels are analogous to &quot;file descriptors&quot; found in Unix-like operating systems.

File channels () can use arbitrary buffers but can also establish a buffer directly mapped to file contents using memory-mapped file. They can also interact with file system locks. Similarly, socket channels ( and ) allow for data transfer between sockets and NIO buffers.

codice_20 can be used to do a file copy, which is potentially far more efficient than using old read/write with a byte array. The typical code for this is:

// Getting file channels
try(FileChannel in = FileChannel.open(source, StandardOpenOption.READ);
 FileChannel out = FileChannel.open(target, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)) {

 // JavaVM does its best to do this as native I/O operations.
 in.transferTo(0, in.size(), out);

===Selectors===
A selector ( and subclasses) provides a mechanism for waiting on channels and recognizing when one or more become available for data transfer. When a number of channels are registered with the selector, it enables blocking of the program flow until at least one channel is ready for use, or until an interruption condition occurs.

Although this multiplexing behavior could be implemented with threads, the selector can provide a significantly more efficient implementation using lower-level operating system constructs. A POSIX-compliant operating system, for example, would have direct representations of these concepts, select(). A notable application of this design would be the common paradigm in server software which involves simultaneously waiting for responses on a number of sessions.

===Character sets===
In Java, a character set is a mapping between Unicode characters (or a subset of them) and bytes.
The package of NIO provides facilities for identifying character sets and providing encoding and decoding algorithms for new mappings.

===Reception===
It is unexpected that a Channel associated with a Java IO RandomAccess file closes the file descriptor on an interrupt, whereas RandomAccessFiles&#x27; associated FileChannel does do this.

==JDK 7 and NIO.2==
JDK 7 includes a package which, with the class (also new to JDK 7), among other features, provides extended capabilities for filesystem tasks, e.g. can work with symbolic/hard links and dump big directory listings into buffers more quickly than the old File class does.
The package and its related package, , provide comprehensive support for file I/O and for accessing the file system. A zip file system provider is also available in JDK 7.

The codice_21 is an example of emulating extensible enums with interfaces. In Java, it is not possible to have one codice_22 extend another codice_22. However, it is possible to emulate an extensible codice_22 type by having an codice_22 implement one or more interfaces. codice_26 is an enum type that implements both the codice_27 and codice_28 interfaces, which emulates the effects of an extensible codice_22 type. A small down-side to this approach is that implementations cannot be inherited between various codice_22 types.

<text>Tuariki John Edward Delamere (born 9 December 1951) is a former New Zealand politician and athlete. He was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in the Te Tai Rawhiti electorate, representing the New Zealand First party, in the 1996 New Zealand general election. He was later a member of the Te Tawharau party, before losing his seat in 1999.

Delamere served in the Fourth National Government, including as Minister of Customs, Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, and Minister of Immigration.

==Early life==
John Edward Delamere was born in 1951 at a military hospital in Papakura, and was educated in Tauranga, attending Tauranga Boys&#x27; College. Of Māori descent through his soldier father, his iwi affiliations include Whakatohea, Te Arawa and Te Whanau-a-Apanui. Delamere adopted the name Tuariki, his father&#x27;s name, in 1997 after he was appointed as a Cabinet minister. Tuariki means &quot;chief of high standing&quot;.

In 1967 and 1969, he was recognised as the top Māori student in New Zealand. He then attended Washington State University on an athletic scholarship. Delamere obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1974. He later obtained a Master of Business Administration from Long Island University.

Delamere served in the United States Army from 1974 to 1978. He was an accountant stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and later joined the staff at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After leaving the United States, Delamere worked as chief financial officer for Polynesian Airlines. In the early 1990s, he held a number of bureaucratic roles in New Zealand, including for the Department of Justice and Te Puni Kōkiri.

Delamere also had a sporting career. He competed and set records in long jump and triple jump, representing New Zealand in those events in the 1974 Commonwealth Games at Christchurch. At Washington State, he pioneered the technique of a full somersault in long jump competitions, which was later banned.

Delamere is married to Jo-Ell; they share three children and eight grandchildren.

==Member of Parliament==
===New Zealand First===
Delamere unsuccessfully sought the National Party nomination in the West Auckland electorate in 1990. He joined New Zealand First in 1993 but did not contest that year&#x27;s general election.

Delamere entered politics in the 1996 elections, when he successfully stood as a candidate for the New Zealand First party in the Te Tai Rawhiti electorate, defeating Sir Peter Tapsell and becoming one of the group known as the Tight Five. Immediately after being elected, he was appointed to Cabinet as part of New Zealand First&#x27;s coalition deal with the National Party. Initially, Delamere was given ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Department and the Public Trust Office; he was also associate Treasurer. He became Minister of Customs and Associate Minister of Health when Neil Kirton was fired in September 1997.

Delamere oversaw the restructuring of the Valuation Department into a Crown-owned company, Quotable Value New Zealand Limited, and the transfer of employees to that company and, in the case of the Valuer-General, to Land Information New Zealand. The restructure was intended to create &quot;improved efficiencies&quot; and cost-savings. As Associate Minister of Health, Delamere held responsibility for Māori health, health regulation and protection, environmental health (including the Smokefree Environments Act) and Pharmac. An anti-smoking campaigner, Delamere declared himself &quot;out to destroy&quot; cigarette companies. He announced a new requirement for health warnings on cigarette packets to be in larger text in August 1998. He sought to ban smoking from all restaurants, schools, and public buildings and to ban displays of cigarettes in stores. These policies would eventually be advanced by the subsequent Labour and National governments.

=== Independent ===
The National–New Zealand First coalition began to break apart in 1998. Following the sudden replacement of Te Tai Tokerau MP Tau Henare as New Zealand First deputy leader with Peter Brown, newspaper reports suggested New Zealand First&#x27;s Tight Five MPs would break away to form a new Māori-led political party. Delamere initially denied involvement, but a leaked report written by Delamere outlined the strategy to launch such a party. Several New Zealand First ministers, including leader Winston Peters, walked out of a Cabinet meeting after disagreeing with the Government&#x27;s policy to sell shares in Wellington Airport. Peters was ultimately sacked from the Cabinet by the prime minister, Jenny Shipley. Despite reports that Delamere was intending a leadership challenge against Peters, Delamere resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August, opting to stay as an independent MP supporting the government. Describing his split from Peters, he said, &quot;I have been lucky and privileged to be here and that&#x27;s all thanks to Winston, I acknowledge that, but at the end of the day, he doesn&#x27;t own my soul.&quot;

In Shipley&#x27;s 31 August 1998 ministerial reshuffle, Delamere was removed from the Cabinet but continued as an associate minister in the finance and health portfolios; he was additionally appointed Minister of Immigration and Minister for Pacific Island Affairs. This, combined with his former role as customs minister, led political commentator Morgan Godfery in 2019 to describe Delamere as &quot;the first Māori to control the borders since... 1840.&quot; On 22 December 1998, Delamere announced gay and lesbian couples applying for permanent residency would have the same rights as straight de facto couples: a change the former immigration minister Max Bradford stated was too difficult.

Delamere was fired from the immigration portfolio in late 1999 after a scandal regarding the application of immigration rules. Specifically, it emerged that Delamere had approved permanent residency for a group of Chinese businessmen provided they invested generously in various Māori development schemes. Delamere was widely criticised for using his authority to ensure that money was given to certain groups. Delamere himself claimed that his actions were a perfectly reasonable method of addressing Māori development needs. Although he lost the immigration portfolio, he retained his other roles.

Through 1998 and 1999, Delamere publicly considered introducing legislation to support the establishment of Māori constituencies for Bay of Plenty Regional Council. This was reported to be a source of tension between him and Peters before the coalition government collapsed. The legislation was later introduced by Labour MP Mita Ririnui and passed in 2001.

=== Te Tawharau ===
Shortly before the 1999 election, Delamere joined the small Māori Te Tawharau party, giving it its first representation in Parliament. He had previously declined to join the Mauri Pacific party, established by five other former New Zealand First MPs, including three of the Tight Five. Shortly prior to the election, Delamere announced that Te Tawharau would support only a Labour Party government on confidence and supply if it won seats in the new Parliament. This was at odds with Delamere&#x27;s unwavering support of the legislative programme of the Shipley Administration. In the elections, Delamere contested the new Waiariki electorate — he placed second, with 20.01% of the vote. The winner was Mita Ririnui of the Labour Party. He was also placed second on the party list of the Mana Māori Movement, which Te Tawharau was affiliated with, but the party did not win any seats.

== Later career ==

=== Private sector career ===
Since leaving Parliament, Delamere has established himself as an immigration consultant, founding the company of Tuariki Delamere &amp; Associates.

In 2000 Delamere rejoined the New Zealand National Party, the party he had started his political career with. However he ruled out a return to Parliament to concentrate on his business concerns.

In March and November 2005, Delamere appeared in court on charges of fraud. The trial began in the High Court in Auckland on 7 February 2007. After a 4-week trial, the jury found him not guilty of all charges after less than 2 hours of deliberation on 2 March 2007.

In late May 2023, Delamere represented a Chinese overstayer known as &quot;Chen&quot; (or &quot;Feng&quot;). Chen alleged that he had been mishandled by Immigration New Zealand compliance officers during a dawn raid in 2022, resulting in a broken left wrist. Immigration NZ disputed Chen&#x27;s account, claiming that he sustained his injuries while attempting to flee compliance officers and resisted arrest. Delamere complained about Chen&#x27;s treatment to the Police, Independent Police Conduct Authority and MBIE. In addition to overstaying his visa, Chen was also charged with being linked to an organised fraud group that was involved in organising travel plans and visa applications. Chen disputed the charges and has applied for refugee status with the Immigration Protection Tribunal, claiming that he risked arrest if deported to China. In response to Chen&#x27;s case, Delamere described Chen&#x27;s case as a &quot;crock of lies&quot; on the part of the immigration department. He also criticised Immigration New Zealand for continuing with dawn raids despite the New Zealand Government&#x27;s apology for dawn raids targeting Pasifika overstayers during the 1970s.

===Return to politics with The Opportunities Party===
In July 2020, more than twenty years after Delamere last stood for office, he joined The Opportunities Party (TOP) and served as its immigration spokesperson and candidate for Auckland Central in the 2020 election. During the 2020 election held on 17 October, Delamere only obtained 320 votes while the TOP party obtained 776 party votes in Auckland Central based on preliminary results.
