<text>The alternative pathway is a type of cascade reaction of the complement system and is a component of the innate immune system, a natural defense against infections.

The alternative pathway is one of three complement pathways that opsonize and kill pathogens. The pathway is triggered when the C3b protein directly binds a microbe. It can also be triggered by foreign materials and damaged tissues.

==Signaling cascade==
This change in shape allows the binding of plasma protein Factor B, which allows Factor D to cleave Factor B into Ba and Bb.

Bb remains bound to C3(H2O) to form C3(H2O)Bb. This complex is also known as a fluid-phase C3-convertase. This convertase, the alternative pathway C3-convertase, although only produced in small amounts, can cleave multiple C3 proteins into C3a and C3b. The complex is believed to be unstable until it binds properdin, a serum protein. The addition of properdin forms the complex C3bBbP, a stable compound which can bind an additional C3b to form alternative pathway C5-convertase.

The C5-convertase of the alternative pathway consists of (C3b)2BbP (sometimes referred to as C3b2Bb). After the creation of C5 convertase (either as (C3b)2BbP or C4b2a3b from the classical pathway), the complement system follows the same path regardless of the means of activation (alternative, classical, or lectin). C5-convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b binds sequentially to C6, C7, C8 and then to multiple molecules of C9 to form membrane attack complex.

==Regulation==
Since C3b is free and abundant in the plasma, it can bind to either a host cell or a pathogen surface. To prevent complement activation from proceeding on the host cell, there are several different kinds of regulatory proteins that disrupt the complement activation process:
* Complement Receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35) and DAF (decay accelerating factor also known as CD55) compete with Factor B in binding with C3b on the cell surface and can even remove Bb from an already formed C3bBb complex
* The formation of a C3 convertase can also be prevented when a plasma protease called complement factor I cleaves C3b into its inactive form, iC3b. Factor I requires a C3b-binding protein cofactor such as complement factor H, CR1, or membrane cofactor of proteolysis (MCP or CD46)
* Complement factor H can inhibit the formation of the C3 convertase by competing with factor B for binding to C3b; accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase; and act as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. Complement factor H preferentially binds to vertebrate cells (because of affinity for sialic acid residues), allowing preferential protection of host (as opposed to bacterial) cells from complement-mediated damage.
* CFHR5 (Complement factor H-Related protein 5) is able to bind to act as a cofactor for factor I, has decay accelerating activity and is able to bind preferentially to C3b at host surfaces.

==Role in disease==
Dysregulation of the complement system has been implicated in several diseases and pathologies, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in which kidney function is compromised. Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is now believed to be caused, at least in part, by complement overactivation in retinal tissues. Alternative pathway activation also plays a significant role in complement-mediated renal disorders such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 glomerulopathy, and C3 glomerulonephritis (Dense Deposit Disease or MPGN Type II).

<doc id="1140227" wikidata="Q6285735" url="?curid=1140227" title="Joseph N. Welch">
<text>Joseph Nye Welch (October 22, 1890 – October 6, 1960) was an American lawyer who served as the chief counsel for the United States Army while it was under investigation for Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, an investigation known as the Army–McCarthy hearings. His confrontation with McCarthy during the hearings, in which he asked McCarthy &quot;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?&quot;, is seen as a turning point in the history of McCarthyism.

== Early life ==
Welch was born in Primghar, Iowa, on October 22, 1890, the seventh and youngest child of English immigrants Martha (Thyer) and William Welch. He attended Grinnell College and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1914, then attended Harvard Law School and graduated in 1917, magna cum laude, with the second highest grade point average in his graduating class. Welch married Judith Lyndon on September 20, 1917. They had two sons, Joe and Lyndon. He enlisted in the United States Army for World War I. After joining as a private in August 1918, he applied for a commission. Welch was attending officer training school at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky, when the Armistice took place. His services no longer required, Welch was discharged from the Army on November 27, 1918.

==Career==
Beginning in 1923, Welch was a partner at Hale and Dorr, a Boston law firm, and lived in nearby Walpole, Massachusetts.

=== Army–McCarthy hearings ===
On June 9, 1954, the 30th day of the Army–McCarthy hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy&#x27;s list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants &quot;before sundown&quot;. McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on a man in his Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, which Brownell had called &quot;the legal mouthpiece of the Communist Party&quot;.
Welch had privately discussed the matter with Fisher beforehand and the two agreed Fisher should not participate in the hearings. Welch dismissed Fisher&#x27;s association with the NLG as a youthful indiscretion and attacked McCarthy for naming the young man before a nationwide television audience without prior warning or previous agreement to do so:


When McCarthy tried to renew his attack, Welch interrupted him:

McCarthy tried to ask Welch another question about Fisher, and Welch interrupted:

At this, those watching the proceedings broke into applause. Welch&#x27;s TV performance turned the tide of public and press opinion against McCarthy overnight. In July, a Republican senator introduced a motion, which passed later that year, censuring McCarthy for acts that &quot;tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute, to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate, and to impair its dignity.&quot;

In his review of the film &quot;Point of Order&quot; that depicted the hearings, Vincent Canby called Welch &quot;one of the great performers ever to appear on the small screen&quot; whether in demanding Cohn expose the security risks in the nation&#x27;s defense plants or accepting a heavily insincere compliment from Cohn, in a manner which demolished Cohn.

===Acting===
Welch played a Michigan judge in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959). He said he took the role because &quot;it looked like that was the only way I&#x27;d ever get to be a judge.&quot; Welch actually took the part on the condition that his wife, Agnes, would be in the film. She was cast as a juror. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for the role. He also narrated the television shows &quot;Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Dow Hour of Great Mysteries&quot;.

==Personal life==
His first wife, Judith Lyndon, died on December 21, 1956, and he married Agnes Rodgers Brown in 1957. After remarrying, he moved to Harwich Port, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, where he lived until his death.

Sixteen days before his 70th birthday, and fifteen months after the release of &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, Welch suffered a heart attack and died on October 6, 1960, at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1977 NBC biopic &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;, Welch was played by Burgess Meredith.
* In the 1992 HBO film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;, Welch was played by Ed Flanders.
* Welch&#x27;s &quot;Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator&quot; passage appears as an excerpt in the R.E.M. song &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot; on their fifth studio album, &quot;Document&quot;.

<text>Ian Edmund Bannen (29 June 1928 – 3 November 1999) was a Scottish actor with a long career in film, on stage, and on television. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965), the first Scottish actor to receive the honour, as well as two BAFTA Film Awards for his performances in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Offence&quot; (1973) and John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987).

On stage, Bannen was renowned for his interpretations of William Shakespeare and Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and was an original member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He won the 1981 Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Translations&quot;.

==Early life==
Bannen was born in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, the son of lawyer John James Bannen (died 1958), of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, and Agnes Clare, née Galloway. After attending St Aloysius&#x27; College, Glasgow and Ratcliffe College, Leicestershire, Bannen served in Egypt as a corporal in the British Army. His first acting role came in a 1947 Dublin stage production of &quot;Armlet of Jade&quot;. He became a successful figure on the London stage, making a name for himself in the plays of both Shakespeare and Eugene O&#x27;Neill. He was an original member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and appeared on Broadway.

==Career==
Bannen&#x27;s film debut was in the early 1950s with a small role in &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1951), and he quickly rose to prominence, primarily in a wide range of supporting roles. He had a very significant role as Stoker Samuel Bannister in &quot;Yangtse Incident&quot;. During the early stages of his career he worked with the Boulting Brothers on &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot;. His performance as Crow in &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)&quot; earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, making him the first Scottish actor to receive this honour; he also received a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year – Actor. That same year, he starred alongside Sean Connery in the WWII prison drama &quot;The Hill&quot;.

Director John Schlesinger cast him as a replacement for Alan Bates in the part of well-off homosexual doctor Daniel Hirsh in his controversial film &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), after Bates was deemed unavailable to shoot. According to screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt, Bannen never felt comfortable with the part. The anxiety adversely affected his performance during the early filming. Schlesinger replaced Bannen with Peter Finch, who received an Oscar nomination for the role. Bannen later regretted this, saying not taking the role had set back his career.

In 1979 he played Jim Prideaux in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.

==Acclaim==
Bannen received an Academy Award nomination in 1965 for Best Supporting Actor, for his performance in &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; as Ratbags Crow, one of the survivors of a plane crash. He also received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as suspected child molester Kenneth Baxter in &quot;The Offence&quot; (1973). He also won acclaim for his roles as Brother Benedict in &quot;Lamb&quot; (1986), Grandfather George in John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987) (for which he received a second Best Supporting Actor BAFTA nomination), the elder Robert de Brus in &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995) and as the touchingly crafty villager in &quot;Waking Ned Devine&quot; (1998).

In 1996, he was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA Scotland.

He was the subject of an episode of &quot;This is Your Life&quot; in 1999, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

==Death==
Bannen was killed, aged 71, in a car accident near Loch Ness in November 1999. He and his wife, Marilyn Salisbury, who had been driving, were discovered in an overturned vehicle in Knockies Straight between Inverness and Fort Augustus. Marilyn, a veterinary physician for the Ministry of Agriculture, suffered only minor injuries. They had married in 1978; Bannen had met Salisbury, 17 years his junior, in a car park following a performance as Hamlet. They had no children. She died on 28 August 2019.

==Legacy==
Coatbridge College, Lanarkshire annually presents the Ian Bannen Memorial Award to the best actor or actress in its classes.

Bannen was posthumously given the 2000 Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award.

<doc id="1140236" wikidata="Q953044" url="?curid=1140236" title="Cycle of the Werewolf">
<text>Cycle of the Werewolf is a horror novella by American writer Stephen King, featuring illustrations by comic-book artist Bernie Wrightson. Each chapter is a short story unto itself. It tells the story of a werewolf haunting a small town as the moon turns full once every month. It was published as a limited-edition hardcover in 1983 by Land of Enchantment, and in 1985 as a mass-market trade paperback by Signet. King also wrote the screenplay for its film adaptation, &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985). It is King&#x27;s shortest novel to date at 127 pages, which makes it technically a novella.

==Synopsis==
The story is set in the fictional town of Tarker&#x27;s Mills, Maine. Each chapter is a month on the calendar. A werewolf is viciously killing local citizens at each full moon, and the otherwise normal town is living in fear. The protagonist of the story is Marty Coslaw, a 10-year-old boy in a wheelchair. The story goes back and forth from the terrifying incidents to Marty&#x27;s youthful day-to-day life and how the horror affects him.

The werewolf&#x27;s first victim is a railroad worker stuck in a tool-and-signal shack during a New Year&#x27;s Day blizzard. Next is a woman in her bedroom who is depressed over not having a man on Valentine&#x27;s Day, followed by a drifter on St. Patrick&#x27;s, one of Marty&#x27;s friends in the city park on April Fools, the janitor of the Grace Baptist Church on Homecoming Sunday in May, the owner of the town&#x27;s only diner, the town constable while he sits in his pickup truck, a herd of hogs at a local farm on Labor Day, and finally an abusive husband around Thanksgiving.

In July, the town&#x27;s Independence Day fireworks have been cancelled. This is very upsetting to Marty, who has been looking forward to them all year. Feeling bad for his nephew, Marty&#x27;s uncle brings him some fireworks, warning Marty to set them off really late so his mother will not find out. While outside enjoying his own private Independence Day celebration as the rest of his family is asleep, the werewolf attacks Marty, who manages to put out the monster&#x27;s left eye with a package of firecrackers. The werewolf escapes and police ignore Marty&#x27;s report because they are looking for a human murderer, not a werewolf. Marty is sent away to Vermont to stay with family for the rest of the summer. As the year continues, the bloodshed occurs again every full moon.

Fall comes and so does Halloween. To celebrate, Marty goes trick-or-treating with his father. While out, he sees Reverend Lowe, the local Baptist preacher, wearing an eyepatch, and he realizes that the Reverend is the monster. However, Lowe does not recognize Marty, as his face is covered by a Yoda mask. Marty, whose family is Catholic, never attend services at Lowe&#x27;s church, which is why he did not work out the werewolf&#x27;s identity sooner.

Over the next few weeks, Marty sends the pastor anonymous letters asking him why he does not kill himself and end the terror. In December, he sends the last letter—signed with his name. Unbeknownst to Reverend Lowe, Marty has convinced his somewhat reluctant uncle to have two silver bullets made and to come spend New Year&#x27;s Eve (which falls on the full moon) with him. Right before midnight, the werewolf breaks into the house to kill Marty. Marty shoots the werewolf twice with the silver bullets, blowing out the beast&#x27;s other eye. After the wolf dies, it changes back into Reverend Lowe, much to the shock of everyone present.

==Characters==

===The Coslaw family===
; Marty Coslaw
: Marty Coslaw, a 10-year-old paraplegic, serves as the novella&#x27;s protagonist. He hears the werewolf howling in March and is attacked by the beast in July, where he blinds it in one eye with a package of Black Cat firecrackers. He discovers the identity of the creature to be Reverend Lester Lowe in October and kills him with a silver bullet in December.
; Nan Coslaw
: Marty&#x27;s mother; she tries to treat him as if he were no different from any other 10-year-old boy.
; Herman Coslaw
: Marty&#x27;s father; he is uncomfortable interacting with his disabled son, speaking to him in a patronizing voice (called the &#x27;Big Pal&#x27; voice by Marty). He is the coach at Tarker&#x27;s Mills High School.
; Kate Coslaw
: Marty&#x27;s 14-year-old sister; she seems jealous of all the attention Marty gets throughout much of the novella.
; Grandpa Coslaw
: Marty&#x27;s paternal grandfather; he lives with the family. Marty has a good relationship with his grandfather, who is described as being the typical grandfather. He is noted for being a heavy sleeper.
; Uncle Al
: Marty&#x27;s wild-living maternal uncle; he always seems to be in the doghouse with his sister. Al treats Marty better than anyone else in the story, and buys him the fireworks Marty uses to blind the werewolf in one eye after the Fourth of July fireworks are cancelled. He also supplies Marty with the silver bullets and the gun he uses to kill the beast in December.

===The werewolf===
Reverend Lester Lowe, the werewolf, is first mentioned in the story in April, preaching a sermon about the coming of spring. Around May, he has a nightmare in which his entire congregation—and then he himself—transform into werewolves before he awakens. The next morning, he finds Clyde Corliss, a custodian, dead on the pulpit at his church. He is seen as a pillar of the community and has been viewed that way for years, coming to call Tarker&#x27;s Mills home.

Lowe has not been a werewolf his entire life, nor has he been a werewolf since he first arrived in Tarker&#x27;s Mills. In fact, it is never explained (nor that he has any idea) about how he became a werewolf, but he suspects that it has something to do with some flowers he picked at a cemetery on Sunshine Hill months prior to his first transformation. He went to put them in vases at the church vestry, but they turned black and died before he could finish the relatively quick job. He has no reason to pinpoint this event as the beginning of his curse, but he believes that this was the beginning of the events. As the werewolf, he serves as the primary antagonist of the novella.

Lowe comes to realize that he is the werewolf after having awakened with fresh blood on his fingernails and (to his horror) mouth. He also discovers his clothes are missing or sometimes finds scratches and bruises, which appear to have come from running through the woods. The nightmare in May serves as a further omen to his curse, but he does not fully realize his curse until July 5, when he awakens with his left eye blasted out. After Halloween, he began getting anonymous letters from someone who knows his secret, suspecting that it is the person whom he attacked in July and failed to kill, the person who blasted his left eye out. In November, he acknowledges that he is the werewolf and decides that he cannot risk going out in the woods, as he could be killed by the group of vigilantes who had taken to the woods that month.

To avoid the vigilantes, he travels to Portland, where he coincidentally kills Tarker&#x27;s Mills resident Milt Sturmfuller outside a cheap motel. After returning home, he decides to find out whom he attacked in July, and confront that person. Marty eventually signs his name to the last letter he sends in December, shortly before the next full moon. Lowe is killed by Marty on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

===The victims===
;Arnie Westrum
: Arnie is a railroad employee killed sometime in the wee hours of the morning on New Year&#x27;s Day in January. He was snowbound in a blizzard after trying to clear snowdrifts off the tracks which had blocked the trains. Westrum manages to hit the werewolf with a pick axe once before it killed him.
; Stella Randolph
: Stella is a plus-sized, unpartnered twenty-two-year-old seamstress whose business is beginning to fail. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, she sends herself cards from 1980s heartthrobs and longs for a sweetheart. She sees the werewolf watching her from outside her window and lets it in, believing she is dreaming and he is her fantasy sweetheart come to life. The werewolf pounces on her and kills Stella in her bed.
; The drifter
: A drifter killed on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in March, he is found by an employee of the Electric and Gas Company while searching for downed lines. His body is surrounded by wolf prints.
; Brady Kincaid
: Brady Kincaid is an 11-year-old boy killed while flying his kite on April Fool’s Day. He had an expensive kite and stayed out too late as he became fascinated by it. He is found the next day, decapitated and disemboweled in the town park.
; Clyde Corliss
: Corliss is found dead in the Grace Baptist Church by Reverend Lowe on Homecoming Sunday in May. He had done janitorial work at the church since the late 1970s.
; Alfie Knopfler
: Knopfler is the owner of the Chat &#x27;n&#x27; Chew, the town&#x27;s only diner. He is killed after high-school graduation in June in his diner. He sees the werewolf transform in front of him before he is killed.
; Constable Lander Neary
: Neary is the town constable and is frustrated by his inability to solve the case and by his patronizing treatment by the Maine State Police. Neary reveals that Marty was sent to stay with some relatives in Stowe, Vermont, for the rest of the summer after his attack in July. His fellow troopers do not let Neary interview the boy, but allow him to have a copy of the deposition Marty gave to them. In it, Marty describes the werewolf in vivid detail, which both the troopers and Neary ignore, including the fact that the werewolf is now missing his or her left eye in human form. Had they not ignored this fact, they could have apprehended Lowe immediately. Both Neary and the troopers believe Marty is suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress syndrome and that the werewolf is a manifestation by Marty&#x27;s psyche as a mental block to the trauma. Neary is killed in August while drinking in his parked truck.
; Elmer Zinneman&#x27;s pigs
: Zinneman is a pig farmer who has his entire pen of pigs killed by the werewolf, but manages to avoid being killed himself on Labor Day in September. He sees something indeterminate running into the woods after his last pig dies, but he cannot say who or what it is that he saw. The next day, he discusses the carnage with his brother Pete from two counties away. Pete tells Elmer that he knows that a werewolf is on the loose in Tarker&#x27;s Mills, citing the unusual tracks in the mud as evidence. The two decide to begin hunting for the beast in November.
; Milt Sturmfuller
: Sturmfuller is the town librarian who is shown to physically abuse his wife in March and again in October. He begins an affair in November and starts staying at a hotel in Portland. He&#x27;s ironically killed by the werewolf while at the hotel in Portland, Lowe having gone there to avoid the vigilante group set up by Zinneman.

==Background and reception==
The story started out as a calendar by Zavista with illustrations by renowned comic-book artist Bernie Wrightson. Each month featured a drawing by Wrightson complete with a short vignette by King. King found the size of the vignettes, which were both small and extremely limited, to be a problem. King proceeded with a short novel and had it published by Land of Enchantment in 1983, complete with Wrightson&#x27;s illustrations.

In the author&#x27;s notes at the end of the book, King admits to taking liberties with the lunar cycle. For example, if a full moon was on New Year&#x27;s Day, another one would not occur on Valentine&#x27;s Day, but these dates are widely recognized in January and February. He explains that this was done to focus the relevant months more clearly in the readers&#x27; minds. Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Cycle of the Werewolf&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #72, writing, &quot;This is of course a werewolf yarn, competently told despite wearying heaps of bodies before we get any actual plot; the triumph of the cute, crippled kid detective over Incarnate Evil comes as no surprise. OK, but expensive for a short story.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
The novella was adapted into a film, &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, in 1985, starring Corey Haim as Marty, Everett McGill as Reverend Lowe, Gary Busey as Marty&#x27;s uncle, Megan Follows as Marty&#x27;s sister, Terry O&#x27;Quinn as the local sheriff, Kent Broadhurst as Brady&#x27;s father, and James Gammon as Arnie Westrum. The movie received mixed reviews and it has since achieved cult status in the US, after appearing on television regularly. In 1985, Signet Books re-issued &quot;Cycle of the Werewolf&quot; under the title &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; in an edition that included King&#x27;s screenplay alongside the original novella. This edition also includes a foreword by King, recounting the impetus of the novella and the background of the film adaptation.

<doc id="1140244" wikidata="Q1191474" url="?curid=1140244" title="Department of the Environment (Australia, 2013–2016)">
<text>The Australian Department of the Environment was a department of the Government of Australia that existed between September 2013 and July 2016. The department was charged with responsibility for developing and implementing national policy, programs and legislation to protect and conserve Australia&#x27;s environment and heritage.

==Structure==
The department was an Australian Public Service Department of State in the environment portfolio, under the &quot;Public Service Act 1999&quot;.

The head of the department was its Secretary, Gordon de Brouwer, responsible to the Minister for the Environment, Josh Frydenberg.

==History==
The department was formed by way of an Administrative Arrangements Order issued on 18 September 2013. It absorbed the responsibilities of the former Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and climate change from the former Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education.

The department was dissolved in July 2016 and its functions, along with energy policy functions, were moved to the newly established Department of the Environment and Energy.

From when it was established in September 2013 to when it was dissolved in July 2016 the department faced significant cuts (25 per cent cut from the organisation&#x27;s budget over four years), in line with the Coalition Government&#x27;s environmental deregulation policies.

== Mission ==
The stated aims of the department were to achieve the protection and conservation of the environment; to ensure that Australia benefits from meteorological and related sciences and services; and to see that Australia&#x27;s interests in Antarctica are advanced. The department developed and implemented national policy, programs and legislation to protect and conserve Australia&#x27;s environment and heritage.

==Operational activities== 
The functions of the department were broadly classified into the following matters:

*The Great Barrier Reef
*Environment protection and conservation of biodiversity
*Air quality
*National fuel quality standards
*Land contamination
*Meteorology
*Administration of the Australian Antarctic Territory, and the Territory of the Heard Island and McDonald Islands
*Natural, built and cultural heritage
*Environmental information and research
*Ionospheric prediction
*Co-ordination of sustainable communities policy
*Population policy
*Urban environment
*Development and co-ordination of domestic climate change policy
*Renewable energy target policy, regulation and co-ordination
*Greenhouse emissions and energy consumption reporting
*Climate change adaptation strategy and co-ordination
*Co-ordination of climate change science activities
*Renewable energy
*Greenhouse gas abatement programs
*Community and household climate action
*Water policy and resources

=== Programs ===
The department managed a number of major programs. The most significant of those dealing with natural resource management came under the umbrella of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Both the Trust and National Action Plan were administered jointly with the Department of Agriculture.

=== Divisions ===
Divisions of the department included the Australian Antarctic Division, Supervising Scientist Division, Heritage Division, Parks Australia, Policy and Communications, Australian Wildlife, Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, Australian Land and Coasts plus a number of executive agencies and statutory authorities.

=== Environmental protection ===
The Department of the Environment administered environmental laws, including the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; and a range of other Acts. It was also responsible for Australia&#x27;s participation in a number of international environmental agreements.

=== Islands administration ===
The department administered areas of the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, and oversees certain policy areas in Norfolk Island and Christmas Island.

<doc id="1140250" wikidata="Q918995" url="?curid=1140250" title="Mohammed Bouyeri">
<text>Mohammed Bouyeri ( ; born 8 March 1978) is a Moroccan-Dutch citizen serving a life sentence without parole at the Nieuw Vosseveld prison for the 2004 murder of Dutch film director Theo van Gogh. A member of the Hofstad Network, he was incarcerated in 2004 and sentenced in 2005.

== Early life ==
Bouyeri was born 8 March 1978 in Amsterdam-Oost, the Netherlands, a second-generation Moroccan-Dutchman of Berber origin. At the age of 7, he moved to Slotervaart/Overtoomse Veld. He was considered to be a promising student; completed his higher secondary education at the Mondriaan Lyceum. He was a havo student, while many Moroccan youth in the Netherlands would only advance to lower vmbo education, including most of Bouyeri&#x27;s class. A former teacher later described him as &quot;timid and observant&quot;, determined to get his diploma. 

He was one of a few local Moroccan boys who got on well with the local police, who otherwise had very negative contact with the Muslim community. In 1994, a local youth center was torn down and replaced with a center for migrants, which Bouyeri and others in the community resented as it serviced adults rather than young people.

== Education ==
In 1997, he began university at the Inholland Hogeschool of Applied Sciences in Diemen. He spent five years studying at the school, being involved in various courses, but finished none of them. He switched majors repeatedly, from accounting to business information technology, but did not put in much effort. In the Netherlands in the 90s, foreign origin students faced higher than usual dropout rates at universities, contributed to by cultural adjustment problems and educational disadvantages they may face.

In summer 2000, Bouyeri, alongside some other men, stormed the school&#x27;s cafe and began a fight with the other patrons, deliberately attacking the Dutch people present. The cafe was disliked by the Muslim students of the school, who viewed it as excluding them. In 2001 Bouyeri got into a fight with a man who was dating one of his sisters. When the police arrived, Bouyeri was found to be holding a knife. Bouyeri attempted to stab one of the responding officers, before throwing the knife at their head. Bouyeri was sentenced to prison, which he served in a detention center in Almere, and was released towards the end of 2001. 

After his release from prison Bouyeri attempted to be a productive member of society. Around the time of his release, his mother died and the September 11 attacks occurred. During 2002 Bouyeri started a course in social teaching assistance at the Amsterdam Hogeschool of Applied Sciences, and started working at the , a community center in Slotervaart/Overtoomse Veld. Bouyeri campaigned for the opening of a youth center in the secondary school, but this plan was rejected by the authorities. He began to believe that Dutch society and its institutions were anti-Moroccan.

== Radicalization ==
After his mother died in 2002 and his father remarried in 2003, he started to live according to strict interpretations of Sunni Islamic Sharia law. At university, he changed his major several times and left after five years without obtaining a degree. Bouyeri used the pen name &quot;Abu Zubair&quot; for writing and translating, under which he wrote radical texts. He often posted letters online and sent emails under this name. 

He would move in spring 2002 out of his parents house to a small apartment in Slotermeer; after this, he became increasingly active online. He would produce pamphlets containing antisemitic and anti-Dutch content. Additionally, due to his strict adherence to Sharia, he could perform fewer and fewer tasks at . For example, he refused to serve alcoholic beverages and did not want to be present at activities attended by both women and men. Finally, he put an end to his activities at altogether. He grew a beard and began to wear a djellaba. He frequently visited the El Tawheed Mosque where he met other radical Sunnis, among whom was the suspected terrorist Samir Azzouz. He was part of the Hofstad Network.
== Murder of Theo van Gogh ==

Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was an often polemic critic of several aspects and figures of Dutch society, including religion. In 2004, van Gogh and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali refugee who had become a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, directed a short film called &quot;Submission, Part I&quot; about Islam and violence against women. 

Bouyeri murdered van Gogh on the early morning of 2 November 2004 in front of the Amsterdam-Oost borough office (Dutch: &quot;stadsdeelkantoor&quot;) while van Gogh was bicycling to work. Bouyeri shot van Gogh eight times with a handgun and also wounded two bystanders. Wounded, van Gogh ran to the other side of the road and fell to the ground in the cycle lane. Bouyeri then walked up to van Gogh, who was still lying down, and shot him several more times at close range. Bouyeri then used a large knife to slit van Gogh&#x27;s throat and attempted to decapitate him, after which he stabbed the knife deep into van Gogh&#x27;s chest, reaching his spinal cord. He then used a fillet knife to attach a five-page note to van Gogh&#x27;s body before fleeing.

The note called for the death of all unbelievers and several people he personally disliked. The note was primarily addressed to Ali, calling her a heretic and a willing collaborator of &quot;Zionists and Crusaders&quot;, saying she would be destroyed. It also attacked other people, containing repeated references to Jewish politicians, referring to a &quot;Jewish cabal&quot; that he said ruled the Netherlands, who he said were Ali&#x27;s masters. Also included in this cabal, according to Bouyeri, were several politicians who were actually not Jewish. 

Van Gogh died at the scene of the crime.

=== Arrest ===
Following an exchange of gunfire with police, during which he was wounded with a shot to his leg, Bouyeri was arrested close to the scene of the crime shortly after its commission. When arrested, Bouyeri had on his person a farewell poem titled (). The poem is written as a standard Dutch rhyming poem. It expressed Bouyeri&#x27;s desire to be killed by the police and become a martyr. In his interrogations, he exercised his right to remain silent.

== Legal proceedings ==

On 11 November 2004, public prosecutor Leo de Wit charged Bouyeri for: 

* Murder
* Attempted murder (of a police officer)
* Attempted manslaughter (of bystanders and police officers)
* Violation of the law on gun control
* Suspicion of participation in a criminal organization with terrorist aims
* Conspiracy to murder with a terrorist purpose against van Gogh, Representative Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the other people mentioned in the letter
He was charged under the Netherlands&#x27; new anti-terrorism law. On 28 November, current affairs program Opsporing Verzocht broadcast a custody photograph of Bouyeri as part of a public appeal from the Public Prosecution Service to retrace his movements in the days prior to the attack on van Gogh. Bouyeri&#x27;s lawyer, Peter Plasman, objected to the broadcast and sued the State and broadcaster AVRO in an Amsterdam court on grounds of violation of personal privacy. Plasman appealed for an injunction before the broadcast to prevent the picture from being released, which was denied. The publishing of Bouyeri&#x27;s photograph was personally approved by justice minister Piet Hein Donner.

Bouyeri&#x27;s trial took place over two days, 11 and 12 July 2005, in a high-security building in Amsterdam&#x27;s Osdorp neighbourhood. In a letter on 8 July, Bouyeri announced that he would not attend the trial voluntarily and that he did not accept the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The prosecutor demanded that he be forcibly transported to the courthouse, which the court granted. Bouyeri&#x27;s attorneys attended the trial, but they did not ask questions or make closing arguments. Bouyeri appeared before the court carrying a Quran under his arm.

At the trial, Bouyeri expressed no remorse for the murder he admitted to having committed, telling van Gogh&#x27;s mother, &quot;I do not feel your pain. I do not have any sympathy for you. I cannot feel for you because I think you&#x27;re a non-believer.&quot; Bouyeri also expressed that he would do it again if given the chance. Bouyeri also argued that &quot;in the fight of the believers against the infidels, violence is approved by the prophet Muhammad.&quot;

The prosecutor demanded life imprisonment for Bouyeri, stating, &quot;The defendant rejects our democracy. He even wants to bring down our democracy. With violence. He is insistent. To this day. He sticks to his views with perseverance.&quot; On 26 July 2005, Bouyeri was sentenced to life in prison, which is the severest punishment under Dutch law. Unlike other European countries, life imprisonment carries no chance of parole in the Netherlands, with the only possibility for release being via a pardon by the reigning monarch. Other than war criminals, Bouyeri was only the 28th person to receive this punishment in the Netherlands since 1945, and the only person to receive a life sentence for a single murder without aggravating circumstances. Life sentences were seen only with multiple-homicide cases, but the () that went into effect on 10 August 2004 extended it to leaders of terrorist organisations. Imprisonments ordinarily in excess of 15 years can be upgraded to life imprisonment, as was the case with Bouyeri. 

In 2014, the investigation was reopened to discuss whether Bouyeri could have had help. Bouyeri is held in the EBI (Supermax) facility within Nieuw Vosseveld prison. There, he met Ridouan Taghi with whom he developed a close bond. Because of this relationship, Bouyeri was moved to another prison. Taghi and Bouyeri continued to write to each other in Arabic, with their writings mostly consisting of Quran verses. In 2017, Bouyeri barricaded himself in his jail&#x27;s kitchen while threatening prison staff by saying that whoever forbade him from praying would get &quot;a dagger between the ribs&quot;. In 2018, he relayed a hand-written book to politicians through a courrier criticizing Richard Dawkins and inviting them to convert to Islam.

== In popular culture ==
* South African artist Marlene Dumas drew a portrait of Bouyeri in 2005 that has been displayed in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.
* Leon de Winter&#x27;s bestselling 2012 novel &quot;Acts of Kindness&quot; features Bouyeri and van Gogh as characters.
* Journalist Theodor Holman, one of van Gogh&#x27;s best friends, wrote a film in 2014 called &quot;2/11 – Het Spel van de Wolf&quot; (a reference to the date van Gogh was killed, 2 November; &quot;The Game of the Wolf&quot;) suggesting that the CIA had been responsible for the killing, as he claimed they had pressured the Dutch secret service to not arrest Bouyeri, in order to use him to get to someone with ties to Al-Qaeda. The film premiered at the Netherlands Film Festival in October 2014 and played on national television on 2 November 2014. The title alludes to Van Gogh&#x27;s movie &quot;06/05&quot;, in which it&#x27;s implied that Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s murder was facilitated by the Dutch secret service agency.

<text>In pragmatics, the origo is the reference point on which deictic relationships are based.

In most deictic systems, the origo identifies with the current speaker (or some property thereof). For instance, if the speaker, John, were to say &quot;This is now my fish&quot;, then John would be the origo, and the deictic word &quot;my&quot; would be dependent on that fact. Likewise, his use of the word &quot;this&quot; and &quot;now&quot; communicate his properties, namely his location and point in time. 

The word origo comes from Latin &quot;origo&quot;, which means &quot;origin&quot; (pl. &quot;origines&quot;). &quot;Origo&quot; is also the origin of the English word &quot;origin&quot;.

This word also occurs in the term phrase &quot;fons et origo&quot;, meaning &quot;source and origin&quot; (&quot;fons&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, &quot;et&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;origo&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;).

<doc id="1140286" wikidata="Q208760" url="?curid=1140286" title="Merlion">
<text>The Merlion () is the official mascot of Singapore. It is depicted as a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish. Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both the city state and its people in sports teams, advertising, branding, tourism and as a national personification.

The Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the tourism board. Its name combines &quot;&quot;, meaning the sea, and &quot;lion&quot;. The fish body represents Singapore&#x27;s origin as a fishing village when it was called &quot;Temasek&quot;, which means &quot;sea town&quot; in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore&#x27;s original name—&quot;Singapura&quot;—meaning &quot;lion city&quot; or &quot;kota singa&quot;.

The symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium, for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in use from 26 March 1964 to 1997 and has been its trademarked symbol since 20 July 1966. Although the STB changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol. Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion frequently appears on STB-approved souvenirs.

== History ==

The Merlion was conceptualised by the vice-chancellor Kwan Sai Kheong of the University of Singapore and constructed from November 1971 to August 1972 by Singapore sculptor Lim Nang Seng (). It measures 8.6 metres high and weighs 70 tons. The project cost about S$165,000.
On 15 September 1972, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew officiated the installation ceremony of the Merlion statue. The original statue stood at the mouth of the Singapore River in Merlion Park.

The completion of the Esplanade Bridge in 1997 blocked the views of the Merlion from the Marina Bay waterfront. The location of the Merlion was also no longer at the entrance of Singapore River due to land reclamation works and also not sprouting water due to a water pump malfunction in 1998, requiring maintenance works on it.

To give the Merlion an unblocked view of the Singapore River, it was suggested to raise the Merlion on a pedestal at its original location. It was deemed unsuitable as the view would still be blocked by the bridge. The other solution was to relocate the Merlion to other places. Possible relocation sites considered included 120 metres away at a new Merlion Park, Nicoll Highway Extension Bridge, Esplanade Park, Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, a promontory at Marina Centre (near where the Singapore Flyer is located now), a promontory site at Bayfront (near the tip of Marina Bay Sands integrated resort) and Kim Seng Park. A new Merlion Park, 120 metres away, on a newly reclaimed promontory in front of the Fullerton Hotel with a Merlion Pier was chosen after the other relocation choices were either unsuitable or not technically feasible.

The relocation took two days, from 23 to 25 April 2002. A carefully engineered journey required one barge, two DEMAG AC1600S cranes of 5000 tonnes lifting capacity, plus a team of 20 engineers and workers on site. The entire statue was hoisted onto the barge, which then sailed to the new installation site at the current Merlion Park, near the mouth of Singapore River. During the voyage, the statue had to be hoisted from the barge, over the Esplanade Bridge and then back onto the barge, as it was too tall to pass underneath.

Exactly 30 years after he officially unveiled the Merlion, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew returned on 15 September 2002 to ceremonially welcome the statue again, this time in its new home. A viewing deck now stretches over the Singapore River, allowing visitors to pose for a photograph with a front or side view of the Merlion, including a new city skyline backdrop in the picture. The sculpture was aligned to face East, a direction advised to be most auspicious. Relocated, the statue once more spouted water from its mouth. The Merlion now has a new two-unit water pump system with units working alternatively, so a backup is always on standby. The relocation and new site (four times larger than the original) cost S$7.5 million.

From 5 June till 10 July 2006, the Merlion at Merlion Park underwent maintenance. The last one was right after its relocation. Dirt and stains were removed using high-pressure water streams, and various wear and tear of the statue was mended.During that period, visitors were greeted with illustrated hoardings and canvases covering the safety nets and scaffolding. The illustrations were designed by Miel, an award-winning senior artist at &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. The illustration on the canvases made them look like shower curtains, with the Merlion sticking its head out with the shadow of its tail behind the curtain. The illustration on the hoardings showed the Merlion scrubbing himself with a brush and showering using a Merlion shower head spouting water. The Merlion said, &quot;EXCUSE ME while I take a shower...&quot; in a speech bubble.

The Merlion on Sentosa was designed and sculpted by an Australian Artist named James Martin. It is made of Glass Reinforced Cement over a steel armature that is attached to the centre.

The Merlion Park was temporarily turned into a single-unit hotel suite, as part of an artwork by Tatzu Nishi, for the duration of the 2011 Singapore Biennale.

== Incident ==
On Saturday, 28 February 2009, at about 4:26 pm, the Merlion in the Merlion Park was struck by lightning. A breaking news from 938NOW local radio showed an image with fragments from the Merlion&#x27;s head on the ground.

Examination of the damage was done quickly with wooden scaffolding set up on Sunday, 1 March 2009 for workers to take a closer look at the hole. The incident happened as a result of the lack of lightning protection on the Merlion itself.

==Merlion statues==


Within Singapore, there are six Merlion statues in Singapore which are approved by the STB.

* The 8.6-metre-tall original statue at Merlion Park.
* The smaller two-metre-tall statue standing behind the original statue weighed 3 ton and was commonly referred to as the &quot;Merlion cub&quot;. It was inlaid with Chinese porcelain plates and bowls as part of its design.
* The three-metre-tall glazed polymarble statue at Tourism Court (near Grange Road) completed in 1995
* The three-metre-tall polymarble statue placed on Mount Faber&#x27;s Faber Point
*A pair of Merlion statues were constructed by the Ang Mo Kio Residential Committee in 1999. They are sitting at the entrance of the car park along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1.

One of the previously approved statues, a 37-metre-tall gigantic replica at Sentosa, with Mouth Gallery Viewing Deck on the ninth storey, another viewing gallery on its head and Sentosa Merlion Shop, and capable of shining laser beams from its eyes, was closed on 20 October 2019. The area around the statue would be replaced by a Sentosa Sensoryscape project targeted to be completed by 2022.

The statues can also be found outside of Singapore in various countries, namely Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, China, Cambodia and the United Kingdom.

In addition, a Roaring Racer Mii Racing Suit based on the Merlion was introduced in the Winter Tour event for &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; in January 2023.

===In literature===
* Edwin Thumboo cemented the iconic status of the Merlion as a personification of Singapore with his poem &quot;Ulysses by the Merlion&quot; in 1979. Due to Thumboo&#x27;s status as Singapore&#x27;s unofficial poet laureate and the nationalistic mythmaking qualities of his poetry, future generations of Singaporean poets have struggled with the symbol of the Merlion, frequently taking an ironical, critical, or even hostile stand – and pointing out its artificiality and the refusal of ordinary Singaporeans to accept a tourist attraction as their national icon. The poem &quot;attracted considerable attention among subsequent poets, who have all felt obliged to write their own Merlion (or anti-Merlion) poems, illustrating their anxiety of influence, as well as the continuing local fascination with the dialectic between a public and a private role for poets, which Thumboo (as Yeats before him, in the Irish context) has wanted to sustain as a fruitful rather than a tense relation between the personal and the public.&quot; Among the poems of this nature are &quot;Merlign&quot; by Alvin Pang and &quot;Love Song for a Merlion&quot; by Vernon Chan. More recent poems include &quot;Merlion: Strike One&quot; by Koh Buck Song in the 2009 anthology, &quot;Reflecting on the Merlion&quot;.
* Merlions as a species were fictional characters in Gwee Li Sui&#x27;s &quot;Myth of the Stone&quot; (1993), the first full-length graphic novel published in Singapore. They were depicted as calm and wise creatures that fought on the side of good and eventually overcame the dreaded Kraken. Gwee further popularised the iconoclastic image of the spitting Merlion in the early 1990s. It reappeared later with his well-loved poem &quot;Propitiations&quot; in his book of poems &quot;Who Wants to Buy a Book of Poems?&quot; (1998).

===As mascots and performance characters===
* For the inaugural Singapore 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, a pair of mascots, Lyo and Merly, were introduced. Merly is a &quot;Merlion-ess cub&quot; based on the Merlion. Her hair is inspired by the lion top half, while her fish half is represented in light-blue scales on her body. Unlike the actual merlion, she has hands and legs instead of a tailfin.
* The 37m-tall Sentosa Merlion appeared in the &quot;Magical Sentosa&quot; show, awakening at the last scene of the show and shining two laser beams out of its eyes at the audience. (Similar to the storyline of the &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; show.)
* The popular Instagram plushie MerRyan is a merlion.

===In local parlance===
* Singaporeans often substitute the term &quot;Merlion&quot; in lieu of vomiting, in reference of the constant gushing of water from the Merlion&#x27;s mouth.

===In sculpture===
* A small Merlion, complete with a plaque giving information about the original statues, forms part of the decoration in the &quot;Mystic East&quot; area of British theme park Chessington World of Adventures.
* The Merlion was featured– or, depending on the point of view, not featured– during the 2005 Venice Biennale in the controversial work &quot;Mike&quot; by artist Lim Tzay Chuen. He had proposed taking the sculpture in the Merlion Park to the Singapore Pavilion at the exhibition, but was refused by the STB. STB offered to install of a life sized replica of the Merlion at the Singapore Pavilion at the Venice Biennale which was rejected by Lim.

<doc id="1140293" wikidata="Q4772832" url="?curid=1140293" title="Anthony John Clark">
<text>Anthony John Clark OBE FRSE (18 September 1951 – 12 August 2004) was an English molecular biologist who was a founder of applying molecular technology to farm animals. He was director of the Roslin Institute from 2002 to 2004.

==Background==
Born in Blackpool, Clark&#x27;s family moved to Lincolnshire and he was educated at Barton Grammar School. He graduated with a degree in natural sciences from Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. He then completed a Masters degree at the University of Western Ontario, with a thesis on the regulation of development in a mudsnail. His PhD on Satellite DNA was conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit in Edinburgh.

==Career==
After achieving his doctorate, Clark joined John Bishop&#x27;s team at the Institute of Genetics, University of Edinburgh, where he carried out research into the genes in the liver of mice. In 1985 he was appointed to the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (subsequently the Roslin Institute) where he began work in genetic modification to produce a sheep giving milk with human proteins. He was successful within five years. Tracy, born in 1990, was the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein, making 35g of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (used in treatment of cystic fibrosis) in each litre of her milk. During the 1990s, Clark continued to develop transgenic techniques on large animals. With his colleagues, he produced a sheep from which a prion protein gene had been removed, the first time this had been achieved in a large animal. Clark&#x27;s work set the stage for Ian Wilmut&#x27;s team at Roslin to clone a sheep, Dolly (1996), the result of transplanted DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilized egg cell. He was appointed an OBE in 1997 for his contribution to Science.

==Personal life== 
Clark met Helen Banfield at Cambridge in 1973, when they were both students. They married in 1975 in Canada and moved to Edinburgh in 1977 where he took his doctorate. They had two sons, Charlie (1989), and Laurie (1991). One of his greatest pleasures was spending time with his family on the remote Isle of Colonsay, in the Inner Hebrides. He was respected by colleagues for his leadership, direction and the support he gave them. Clark died at the age of 52, suffering from depression. He was found hanged in his holiday home.

<doc id="1140294" wikidata="Q2296791" url="?curid=1140294" title="Molly Bloom">
<text>Molly Bloom is a fictional character in the 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce. The wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not. Molly is having an affair with Hugh &#x27;Blazes&#x27; Boylan. Molly, whose given name is Marion, was born in Gibraltar on 8 September 1870, the daughter of Major Tweedy, an Irish military officer, and Lunita Laredo, a Gibraltarian of Spanish descent. Molly and Leopold were married on 8 October 1888. She is the mother of Milly Bloom, who, at the age of 15, has left home to study photography. She is also the mother of Rudy Bloom, who died at the age of 11 days. In Dublin, Molly is an opera singer of some renown.

The final chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, often called &quot;Molly Bloom&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot;, is a long and almost entirely unpunctuated passage comprising her thoughts as she lies in bed next to Leopold.

==Soliloquy==

Ms Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy is the eighteenth and final &quot;episode&quot; of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, in which the thoughts of Molly Bloom are presented in contrast to those of the previous narrators, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus. Molly&#x27;s physicality is often contrasted with the intellectualism of the male characters, Stephen Dedalus in particular.

Joyce&#x27;s novel presented the action with numbered &quot;episodes&quot; rather than named chapters. Most critics since Stuart Gilbert, in his &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses&quot;, have named the episodes and they are often called chapters. The final chapter is referred to as &quot;Penelope&quot;, after Molly&#x27;s mythical counterpart.

In the course of the monologue, Molly accepts Leopold into her bed, frets about his health, and then reminisces about their first meeting and about when she knew she was in love with him. The final words of Molly&#x27;s reverie, and the final words of the book, are:

Joyce noted in a 1921 letter to Frank Budgen that &quot;The last word (human, all too human) is left to Penelope.&quot; The episode both begins and ends with &quot;yes&quot;, a word that Joyce described as &quot;the female word&quot; and that he said indicated &quot;acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance.&quot; This last, clear &quot;yes&quot; stands in sharp contrast to her unintelligible first spoken line in the fourth chapter of the novel.

Molly&#x27;s soliloquy consists of eight enormous &quot;sentences&quot;, The concluding period following the final words of her reverie is one of only two punctuation marks in the chapter, the periods at the end of the fourth and eighth &quot;sentences&quot;. When written this episode contained the longest &quot;sentence&quot; in English literature, 4,391 words expressed by Molly Bloom (it was surpassed in 2001 by Jonathan Coe&#x27;s &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot;).

==Sources==

Joyce modelled the character upon his wife, Nora Barnacle; indeed, the day upon which the novel is set—16 June 1904, now called Bloomsday—is that of their first date. Nora Barnacle&#x27;s letters also almost entirely lacked capitalization or punctuation; Anthony Burgess said that &quot;sometimes it is hard to distinguish between a chunk of one of Nora&#x27;s letters and a chunk of Molly&#x27;s final monologue&quot;. Some research also points to another possible model for Molly in Amalia Popper, one of Joyce&#x27;s students to whom he taught English while living in Trieste. Amalia Popper was the daughter of a Jewish businessman named Leopoldo Popper, who had worked for a European freight forwarding company (Adolf Blum &amp; Popper) founded in 1875 in its headquarters in Hamburg by Adolf Blum, after whom Leopold Bloom was named. In the (now published) manuscript &quot;Giacomo Joyce&quot;, are images and themes Joyce used in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;.

<doc id="1140295" wikidata="Q2418647" url="?curid=1140295" title="Nyishi people">
<text>Nyishi community is the largest ethnic group in Arunachal Pradesh in north-eastern India. The Nyishi language belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family, however, the origin is disputed. Their population of around 300,000 makes them the most populous tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, closely followed by the tribes of the Adi according to 2001 census.

Polygyny is prevalent among the Nyishi. It signifies one&#x27;s social status and economical stability and also proves handy during hard times like clan wars or social huntings and various other social activities. This practice, however is diminishing especially with the modernization and also with the spread of Christianity. They trace their descent patrilineally and are divided into several clans.

== Origin ==
As per the Nyshi mythology, there were many versions of Abo Tanyi in the form of spirits and other beings. Nyiha (Niya) is one of the sons of Abo Tanyi, which is the first perfect human being, and the Nyishi are his descendants.

The human being genealogy/ancestry is recalled as:

Tanyi - Nyiha - Hari &amp; Haring.

Hari - Riku - Kunghi - Hingbing - Bingdung and Bingley.

Haring - Ringdo - Dopum, Dodum and, Dolu.

To learn more about the Genealogy of the Nyishi Tribe,

== Etymology ==

In Nyishi, &quot;Nyi&quot; refers to &quot;a human&quot; and the word &quot;shi&quot; denotes &quot;here, this or being&quot;, thereby Nyishi means human being or this human. The Nyishis are mentioned as the Dafla people in the contemporary Ahom documents and consequently, the British documents and historians of the post-independence period also used the same term. The Nyishi are geographically concentrated around the Dafla Hill range, located in the northern part of the Papum Pare district. Previously, they were referred to as Dafla, a term replaced by &quot;Nyishi&quot; through the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act of 2008. 

==Distributions==
They are spread across eight districts of Arunachal Pradesh: Kra Daadi, Kurung Kumey, East Kameng, West Kameng, Papum Pare, Keyi Panyor, parts of Lower Subansiri, Kamle, and Pakke Kessang district. The Kurung Kumey and Kra Daadi districts have the largest concentration of Nyishi population. The Nyishis also live in the Sonitpur and North Lakhimpur districts of Assam.

== Economy ==
The Nyishi are agriculturalists who practice &quot;jhum&quot;, known as &quot;rët rung-o&quot; in Nyishi, which is a form of shifting cultivation. The principal crops raised include paddy (rice), &quot;toppu&quot; (maize), &quot;mekung&quot; (cucumber), &quot;tak-yi&quot; (ginger), &quot;aeng&quot; (yams) and &quot;temi&quot; (millet), thumpe &quot;(pumpkin)&quot;, perring (&quot;bean&quot;) and some leafy vegetables as their self-subsistence products. Rice is the staple food of the people, supplemented by fish, meat of various animals, edible tubers. Before a Western market economic system arrived, they used a barter system. They greatly valued the generalized reciprocity and also balance reciprocity in their economic system. A locally-made drink known as &quot;upo&quot; (the two types of &quot;upo&quot;: &quot;pone&quot;, made of rice, and &quot;polin&quot; which is made of millet) is served at every social gatherings and important events. The Nyishis are typically fond of it. Traditional ways of preparing them include fermentation, steaming, roasting and smoking. Recently they have been forced to move towards a market based exchange economy.

== Attire ==
Traditionally, Nyishi plaited their hair and tie it neatly at the forehead with locally-made thread. A brass skewer passes horizontally through the tied hair. Cane rings were worn around the waist, arms and legs. Men wore a cane helmet surmounted with the beak of the great Indian hornbill. The usage of actual hornbill beaks is discouraged these days due to tough wildlife protection laws since the great Indian hornbill is a protected species and generally due to growing awareness among the people as well. Nowadays It is being supplemented by beaks made of cane or other materials and the entire headgear/cane helmet itself is readily available in the market for purchase. Additional decorations varied depending upon the status of the person and were symbols of manly valor.

The clothing of the men consists of two types of sleeveless shirts (letum) and with black and white stripe (pomo) made from thick cotton cloth, striped gaily with blue and red together with a mantle of cotton or wool fastened around the throat and shoulders. Strings made of beads in varying sizes and colours are also worn, mainly for decoration purposes and to show the wearer&#x27;s status. They also carry a machete or dao (&quot;uryu&quot;) in Nyishi) (short sword) and a knife (&quot;&quot;) in a bamboo sheath that are mostly covered with animal furs. Their ornaments consist of a spear with an iron head, a large sword (&quot;uryu&quot;), and a bow and arrows which are tipped with poison (&quot;um-yu&quot;). During war both the chest and back are covered with shields made from sabbe buffalo hide, and over it they wear a black cloak made of indigenous fibre.

The Nyishi women generally wear a sleeveless mantle of striped or plain cloth, its upper part tucked tightly over the breast and enveloping the body from the armpits to the centre of the calves addition with different colour tops worn underneath among which red ( / ) is generally used . A ribbon is tied at the waist. A girdle consisting of metal disks, beads, and cane garters is worn at the waist. Their hair is parted in the middle, plaited and tied into a chignon just above the nape. Their ornaments include multicolored bead necklaces, brass chains, metal bells, huge brass or silver earrings and heavy bracelets of various metals.

== Religion ==
&quot;Nyokum, Boori-Boot, and Longte&quot; are the festivals celebrated by the Nyishi people, which commemorates their ancestors.

As per the Donyi Polo, the Nyishi believes that everything in nature has owner (&quot;spirit or uyu,wiyu&quot;). The priest (&quot;Nyubh&quot;) acts as the translator/mediator/negotiator between the human and the spirit and performs rituals and animals sacrifices to please the spirits. The spirits may be benevolent or malevolent.

Christian missionaries began operating in Arunachal Pradesh in the 1950s; however, many of their proselytising activities were limited by the government until the 1970s. According to a 2011 survey, many of the Nyishi people have become Christian (31%), followed by Hinduism (29%), with many of the remaining still following the ancient indigenous Donyi-Polo.

According to Nyishi history, the concept of institutionalized religion was absent, as there were no alternative forms of worship or deities beyond the spirits of nature that could be classified as a distinct religion. After coming in contact with British India, the idea of religion was known. The spread of Christianity and Hinduism led to the need for preservation of indigenous religion Donyi Polo.

== The Hornbill issue ==
The Nyishis, who traditionally wear cane helmets surmounted by the crest of a hornbill beak (known as &quot;pudum&quot; or &quot;padam&quot;), have considerably affected the population of this bird.

Several organizations, such as the Arunachal Wildlife and Nature Foundation and the Wildlife Trust of India, have been trying to stop the Nyishi hunting these birds in order to protect them from extinction. Nature reserves, such as the Pakke Sanctuary, are being set up to protect the birds, while artificial materials, such as fiberglass, have been introduced as an alternative to the hornbill beak in Nyishi dress.

Hornbill Nest Adoption Program(HNAB) has been going on since 2011, which is a community led conservation initiative through which local tribal villagers protect nest trees of hornbills in forests around villages on the fringe of the Pakke Tiger Reserve. The hunters from Nyishi tribe are now protectors who try to save the hornbill population, due to which hornbill populations have been doing well inside the protected area.

<text>The Harker School is a private, co-educational school located in San Jose, California. Founded in 1893 as Manzanita Hall, Harker has three campuses: Bucknall, Union, and Saratoga, named after the streets on which they lie.

The Bucknall campus houses the Lower School (kindergarten through grade 5), the Union campus houses the Middle School (grades 6–8), and the Saratoga campus houses the Upper School (grades 9 through 12).

Harker School&#x27;s tuition varies by campus, and is higher than comparable private schools in the Bay Area. Many of the 35+ after-school programs have historically been included in the tuition.

== History ==

The Harker School was founded as three distinct schools, which merged in 1972 to form Harker Academy and in 1993, Harker School.

=== Manzanita Hall and Palo Alto Military Academy ===
In 1891, Stanford University founding president David Starr Jordan influenced Frank Cramer to open the Palo Alto Preparatory School for Boys. The school was renamed &quot;Manzanita Hall&quot; in 1892, and by September 1894 the school enrolled 24 students. In 1893, the school was a boys day school and boarding school. The &quot;Manzanita Hall&quot; school began at 1129 Parkinson Avenue in Palo Alto, California. In 1915, the enrollment was 60 boys. in 1919, &quot;Manzanita Hall&quot; was purchased and renamed &quot;Palo Alto Military Academy&quot;, which remained until 1972.

=== Miss Harker&#x27;s School ===
In 1902, &quot;Miss Harker&#x27;s School&quot; was founded by Catherine Harker as a girls day school, with a limited boarding school, also located in Palo Alto. In 1917, the enrollment was 40 girls and it served as a preparatory school for competitive colleges such as Stanford University. From 1902 to 1907, &quot;Miss Harker&#x27;s School&quot; was located at 1121 Bryant Street in Palo Alto; and moved to 1050 Greenwood Avenue in Palo Alto, where the campus expanded and the nearby streets were renamed (Melville and Harker Street) to reflect the campus.

=== Harker Academy ===
In 1972, the &quot;Palo Alto Military Academy&quot; and &quot;Miss Harker&#x27;s School&quot; merged to form the &quot;Harker Academy&quot;. With the merger, the school moved to 500 Saratoga Avenue in San Jose, California. in 1993, its name changed to &quot;Harker School&quot;.

In 1954, the Harker School joined the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

== Campus ==

=== Upper school ===
The upper school, offering grades 9 through 12, is located on the Saratoga Avenue campus. The campus was previously home to an all-girls school, &quot;Mother Butler Memorial High School&quot;, which merged with Archbishop Mitty High School in 1969. The upper school was added to the K–8 program in 1998, with the first class of graduates in 2002.

=== Middle school ===
The middle school is located on the Union campus, the former site of the Harker Preschool. Since the opening of the upper school in 1998, most students choose to remain at Harker School after middle school. Many components ease the shift from the lower school to the middle school, including various athletic and artistic programs. There is also a fine arts requirement: students in grades 7 and 8 must take at least one arts class or participate in one art event in order to graduate (sixth graders are encouraged to do so, as well).

=== Lower school ===
The elementary school is located on the Bucknall campus, the former site of &quot;Bucknall Elementary School&quot;. The campus was purchased by Harker School in 1997. The lower school also has an after-school orchestra, as well as sports and other activities.

== Academics ==

<text>The Byrd Glacier () is a major glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide.
It drains an extensive area of the Antarctic plateau, and flows eastward to discharge into the Ross Ice Shelf.

==Location==

The Byrd Glacier flows eastward between the Britannia Range to the north and the Churchill Mountains to the south.
It discharges into the Ross Ice Shelf at Barne Inlet.
Its mouth lies between Cape Kerr to the north and Cape Selborne to the south.
The valley below the glacier used to be recognised as one of the lowest points not to be covered by water on Earth (assuming ice does not count as water), reaching below sea level.

The glacier was named by the NZ-APC after Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, United States Navy, American Antarctic explorer.

==Mouth==
===Barne Inlet===
A reentrant about wide occupied by the lower part of Byrd Glacier, lying between Cape Kerr and Cape Selborne on the west side of the Ross Ice Shelf. Discovered by the BrNAE (1901-04) and named for Lt. Michael Barne, RN, a member of the expedition, who with Sub-Lt. George F.A. Mulock, RN, mapped the
coastline this far south in 1903.

===Cape Kerr===
A high snow-covered cape at the north side of Barne Inlet, the terminus of Byrd Glacier at the W side of the Ross Ice Shelf.

===Cape Selborne===
A high snow-covered cape at the south side of Barne Inlet, the terminus of Byrd Glacier at the west side of the Ross Ice Shelf.
Discovered by the BrNAE (1901-04) and named for William Waldegrave Palmer Selborne, Second Earl of Selborne, who entered the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1900. Not: Cape Selbourne, Cape Selhora.

<text>A headliner often is a composite material that is adhered to the inside roof of automobiles, aircraft, and yachts. It typically consists of a face fabric with nonwoven or foam backing. Headliners consist of multilayered composite materials that bring together multiple functionalities, including the requested look, feel, stiffness, and sound reduction needed in cars. Automotive headliners are optimised with respect to head impact counter measures or to integrate additional LED lighting film behind the fabric. Most headliners consist of a tricot knit fabric that is napped to provide a soft touch and uniform appearance. The fabric is adhered to melted polyurethane foam. This fabric-foam composite is glued to the interior fiberglass roof of the automobile.

There are more complex knit products used as a face fabric, as well as less expensive non-woven products. Recent headliner developments include environmentally friendly products made of recyclable backing-adhesive and face fabrics.

In yachts, foam-backed vinyl is often used.

==Replacements==
When a headliner fails, it sags or falls from the roof. One can use upholstery twist pins (a flat-headed corkscrew-like pin) to effect a temporary repair, but repairs usually involve tacking or replacing the entire headliner. Heat, humidity, and time rapidly degrade the bond that the polyurethane foam has with the face fabric. As the foam oxidizes and yellows, the fabric-foam bond fails. This failure is more common in cars produced in the 1970s.

Replacing the entire headliner fabric is usually necessary as the oxidized foam can prove nearly impossible to remove from the sagging fabric.

<doc id="1140316" wikidata="Q5469048" url="?curid=1140316" title="Forest Park (Springfield, Massachusetts)">
<text>Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts, is one of the largest urban, municipal parks in the United States, covering of land overlooking the Connecticut River. Forest Park features a zoo, aquatic gardens, and outdoor amphitheater, in addition to design elements like winding wooded trails, and surprising, expansive views. The site of America&#x27;s first public, municipal swimming pool, currently, during the holiday months Forest Park hosts a popular high-tech lighting display, known as &quot;Bright Nights&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the park was not designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, although it was designed by his firm.

==History==

In 1884, Springfielder Orick H. Greenleaf offered for the establishment of a park to be named Forest Park. Shortly after, approximately were donated by wealthy philanthropist Everett Hosmer Barney. Barney made his fortune as a Civil War arms producer and later as a businessman, inventing clamp-on ice skates and rollerskates.
In 1890 Barney built an elaborate, turreted -story Victorian mansion on a hill at the west end of his estate, which featured a spectacular view of the Connecticut River and Metro Center Springfield. The mansion&#x27;s elaborate carriage house still stands, today serving as a restaurant and banquet hall in Forest Park.

To create the parcel of land on which Forest Park was built, Greenleaf and Barney convinced several of their wealthy friends and neighbors to donate much of the remaining land that would ultimately make-up the 735-acre Forest Park. They both became members of the Board of Park Commissioners, which also listed John Olmsted (resigned on March 1, 1886). At the time, much of this land was located in the neighboring suburb of Longmeadow, Massachusetts, (which had separated from Springfield nearly a century before the construction of Forest Park). Ultimately, Longmeadow ceded complete control of Forest Park to the City of Springfield. 

In October 2017, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced that the state would assume the $3 million costs to repair a culvert at the main entrance of the park.

On Aug. 27, 2024, Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno and Parks Director Tom Ashe unveiled a new street sign for Chief Joe Luvera Way. Joseph Luvera (1930 - 2021) founded the Springfield Park Rangers in 1990, and served as its volunteer chief for over 25 years. He led a group of more than two dozen volunteer rangers. The newly named street is inside the Trafton Road entrance to the park. The mayor called Joe an &quot;unsung hero&quot; and &quot;dedicated public servant.&quot;

==Interstate 91==
The Barney Mansion was used for Forest Park events until the mid-1950s, when about of the park, including of the former Barney estate, were taken to construct the Springfield/Longmeadow sections of Interstate 91. Barney&#x27;s house stood atop the hill at the northwest corner of the park, and the highway construction may have threatened its foundations; anticipating that, it was razed.
Ultimately, the construction of I-91 severed the Forest Park&#x27;s connection to the Connecticut River.

The Barney Mansion&#x27;s stained glass windows were moved to a house in Palmer, Massachusetts, where the demolition contractor lived at the time. The mausoleum of Barney&#x27;s son and a carriage house still survive from the estate, along with many remnants of an extensive arboretum and water gardens planted by Barney around 1900. The developer of the Forest Park neighborhood continued this theme by planting many specimen trees, especially around Magnolia Terrace. This historic neighborhood with many fine examples of Victorian houses abuts the park on the north, while a small enclave of Springfield&#x27;s stately brick colonial homes and the town of Longmeadow, Massachusetts borders the park to the south.

==Attractions==
Among the Forest Park&#x27;s notable year-round attractions are the Forest Park Zoo, which features large cats, monkeys, birds, and a number of other &quot;exotic and indigenous animals&quot;; several playgrounds; Porter Lake; an ice hockey and ice-skating rink, Cyr Arena; several baseball diamonds and a grandstand; a rose garden; a bocce court; a lawn bowling court; basketball and tennis courts; an aquatic garden (in the Asian style); numerous promenades; a beach volleyball court; several wooded groves; picnic areas; America&#x27;s first public swimming pool (1899); ponds with various waterfowl; an exhibit of ancient dinosaur tracks, and an eternal flame that burns 24 hours a day honoring President John F. Kennedy.

The ruggedly contoured valley of Pecousic Brook occupies more than half of the south side of the Forest Park. This area has been left largely Naturalist in style, although it features many walking trails and a few elegant bridges. This network of trails includes the Meadowbrook Ravine Trail, accessible near Barney Pond, and is a wide, well-traveled path with outlets to the Forest Park neighborhood of Springfield. 

The park is also home to many species of birds and wildlife.

The statue at the Route 5 entrance to Forest Park was created by Peter Wolf Toth and is part of the &quot;Trail of the Whispering Giants&quot;. The statue represents Omiskanoagwiak.

A statue of a golden retriever, &quot;Stone Dog II&quot;, currently stands between the park&#x27;s largest playground and the zoo. The statue is a near replica of an older statue (known by Springfield natives and park patrons as &quot;Stone Dog&quot;), which went missing from the park in 1987. The original &quot;Stone Dog&quot; dates back to the late 19th century.

Since 1970, the Environmental Center for Our Schools (or ECOS, as it is commonly called) takes all Springfield public school students in grades four through seven on a two-day environmental learning outing in Forest Park. The headquarters of this organization is located in Forest Park.

==Camp STAR==
During Summer, Camp STAR/Angelina is an inclusive camp for children of all abilities, ages 3 to 22 years old. Some of the special needs populations the camp has worked with include: developmental delays, ADD/ADHD, emotional problems, learning disabilities, and visual and hearing impairments. Camp STAR/Angelina is a 6-week summer program. The camp is located on the outskirts of Forest Park off Trafton Road and activities include swimming, sports, games, crafts, field trips and an end of camp variety show.

==Bright Nights==

&quot;Bright Nights at Forest Park&quot; is a national attraction from Thanksgiving through New Year&#x27;s Day. It is a lighting spectacle that features time and color coordinated lighting exhibits. Trees and sculptures are decorated to look like various scenes and characters, including many from the works of Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Many scenes are animated; others are simply decorative. One of the spectacles&#x27; most elaborate exhibits is a replica of Everett Barney&#x27;s mansion. Viewers in automobiles queue up to drive for approximately three miles along a meandering path through the park to see the displays.

<text>The Britannia Range () is a range of mountains bounded by the Hatherton Glacier and Darwin Glacier on the north and the Byrd Glacier on the south, westward of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

==Exploration and naming==
The Britannia Range was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901–04) under Robert Falcon Scott.
It was named after HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, a vessel utilized as the Britannia Royal Naval College in England, which had been attended by several officers of Scott&#x27;s expedition.

==Location==

The Britannia Range is east of the Antarctic Plateau.
It is south of the Darwin Mountains and the Cook Mountains, which are north of the Hatherton Glacier and the Darwin Glacier.
At the mouth of the Darwin Glacier the range adjoins the Gawn Ice Piedmont, which extends into the Ross Ice Shelf to the east.
The Byrd Glacier flows northeast past the south side of the Gawn Ice Piedmont.
It divides the Britannia Range from the Churchill Mountains to the south.

==Major glaciers==
* Hatherton Glacier (), a large glacier flowing from the polar plateau generally eastward along the south side of the Darwin Mountains and entering Darwin Glacier at Junction Spur.
* Darwin Glacier (), a large glacier in Antarctica. It flows from the polar plateau eastward between the Darwin Mountains and the Cook Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf. The Darwin and its major tributary the Hatherton are often treated as one system, the Darwin–Hatherton.
* Byrd Glacier (), a major glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide. It drains an extensive area of the Antarctic plateau, and flows eastward to discharge into the Ross Ice Shelf.

==Features==
* Turnstile Ridge (), a ridge about long, lying north of Westhaven Nunatak at the northwest extremity of the Britannia Range.
* Derrick Peak (), a prominent ice-free peak, high, overlooking the south side of Hatherton Glacier, west of the north end of Johnstone Ridge.
* Mount Henderson (), a prominent mountain, high, standing west of Mount Olympus.
* Ravens Mountains (), a symmetrical group of mountains on the west side of Hughes Basin. The mountains are long and rise to in Doll Peak.
* Hughes Basin (), a large basinlike névé which is bounded except to the south by Ravens Mountains, Mount Henderson, Mount Olympus and Mount Quackenbush. The feature is long and the ice surface descends north–south from near Mount Olympus to near Darnell Nunatak, where there is discharge to Byrd Glacier.
* Mount McClintock (), the highest mountain () in the Britannia Range, surmounting the south end of Forbes Ridge, east of Mount Olympus.
*Mount Aldrich (), a massive, somewhat flat-topped mountain standing at the east side of Ragotzkie Glacier.

<text>Warren Mercer Oates (July 5, 1928 – April 3, 1982) was an American actor best known for his performances in several films directed by Sam Peckinpah, including &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969) and &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; (1974). Another of his most acclaimed performances was as officer Sam Wood in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967). Oates starred in numerous films during the early 1970s that have since achieved cult status, such as &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971), &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; (1971), and &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (1975). Oates also portrayed John Dillinger in the biopic &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973) and as the supporting character U.S. Army Sergeant Hulka in the military comedy &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981). Another notable appearance was in the classic New Zealand film &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; (1977), in which he played the commander of the American forces in the country.

==Early life==
Warren Oates was born and reared in Depoy, a tiny rural community in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, located just a few miles west of Greenville, the county seat. According to the federal census of 1940, he was the younger of two sons born to Sarah Alice (née Mercer) and Bayless Earle Oates, who owned a general store. His brother, Gordon, was five years his senior. On his father&#x27;s side, Warren was of English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. He attended Louisville Male High School in Louisville, Kentucky, until 1945, but did not graduate from that institution. He did, however, later earn a high-school equivalency diploma. After high school, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps for two years (1946–1948), serving in its air wing as an aircraft mechanic and reaching the rank of corporal. Oates became interested in theater while attending the University of Louisville, where in 1953, he starred in several plays produced by the school&#x27;s Little Theater Company. Four years later, in New York City, he got an opportunity to star in a live production of the television series &quot;Studio One&quot;.

==Career==
Oates moved to Los Angeles, where in the 1950s, he began to establish himself in guest roles in weekly television Westerns, including &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, &quot;Buckskin&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Trackdown&quot;, &quot;Tate&quot;, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Subterranean City&quot; (October 14, 1958) of the syndicated &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, Oates played a gang member, Pete, who is the nephew of series character Skip Johnson (Lang Jeffries). In the story line, rescuers Johnson and Wes Cameron (Jim Davis) search for a lost girl in the sewer tunnels and encounter three criminals hiding out underground. Pete soon breaks with his gang companions and joins the firemen Wes and Skip in locating the missing child.

In 1961, Oates guest-starred in the episode &quot;Artie Moon&quot; in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Lawless Years&quot; crime drama about the 1920s. In 1962, he appeared as Ves Painter in the short-lived ABC series &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;, co-starring Jack Lord, a program about rodeo contestants.

Oates also played in a number of guest roles on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (in &quot;The Purple Testament&quot; and &quot;The 7th Is Made Up of Phantoms&quot; S5 E10 1963, in which he costarred with Randy Boone and Ron Foster), &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (&quot;The Mutant&quot; [1964]), &quot;Combat! &quot;(&quot;The Pillbox&quot; [1964]) and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (&quot;Welcome Stranger&quot; [1965]). During the 1960s and 1970s, he guest-starred on such shows as &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (&quot;The Hotshot&quot; [1965]), &quot;Lancer&quot;, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. While making a guest appearance on a segment of the Western television series &quot;Dundee and the Culhane&quot;, Oates managed to steal the show with his off-camera antics and bloopers that had everyone on the set rolling. After a long day of filming, he headed over and set his footprints in concrete along with all the other stars who appeared at Apacheland Movie Ranch.

&quot;There were 40 [Western] series, and I went from one to the other. I started out playing the third bad guy on a horse and worked my way up to the number-one bad guy,&quot; Oates once quipped. Oates did play the good guy once as Deke Bassop in the title role of the episode “The Bassops” on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1964.

Oates first met Peckinpah when he played a variety of guest roles in &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958–1963), a popular television series co-created and sometimes directed by Peckinpah. He also played a supporting role in Peckinpah&#x27;s short-lived series &quot;The Westerner&quot; in 1960. The collaboration continued as he worked in Peckinpah&#x27;s early films &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962) and &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965) and resulted in two of his most famous film roles. In the 1969 Western classic &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, he portrayed Lyle Gorch, a long-time outlaw who chooses to die with his friends during the film&#x27;s violent conclusion. According to his wife at the time, Teddy, Oates had the choice of starring in &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot;, to be filmed in Los Angeles, or &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; in Mexico. &quot;He had done &quot;Return of the Seven&quot; in Mexico; he got hepatitis, plus dysentery, but off he went again with Sam [Peckinpah]. He loved going on location. He loved the adventure of it. He had great admiration for Sam.&quot; In &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;, the dark 1974 action/tragedy also filmed in Mexico, Oates played the lead role of Bennie, a hard-drinking, down-on-his-luck musician and bartender hoping to make a final score. The character was reportedly based on Peckinpah. For authenticity, Oates wore the director&#x27;s sunglasses while filming scenes of the production.

Although the Peckinpah film roles are his best-known, his most critically acclaimed role is GTO in Monte Hellman&#x27;s 1971 cult classic &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;. The film, although a failure at the box office, is studied in film schools as a treasure of the 1970s, in large part due to Oates&#x27; performance. Film critic Leonard Maltin remarked that Oates&#x27; performance as GTO was as good as any he had seen and should have won the Oscar. Oates had a close relationship with Hellman, and worked with him on three other films: the western film &quot;The Shooting&quot; (1966), co-starring a young Jack Nicholson, &quot;Cockfighter&quot; (1974), and &quot;China 9, Liberty 37&quot; (1978), in which Peckinpah, who was also a friend of Hellman&#x27;s, featured in a rare acting role. Oates&#x27; wife Teddy said, &quot;Sam Peckinpah and Monte Hellman were the two directors with whom Warren would work anytime, anywhere.&quot;
In addition to Peckinpah and Hellman, Oates worked with several major directors of his era, including Leslie Stevens in the 1960 film &quot;Private Property&quot;, his first starring role; Norman Jewison in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967); Joseph L. Mankiewicz in &quot;There Was a Crooked Man...&quot; (1970); John Milius in &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973); Terrence Malick in &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973); Philip Kaufman in &quot;The White Dawn&quot; (1974); William Friedkin in &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978); and Steven Spielberg in &quot;1941&quot; (1979).

He appeared in the Sherman Brothers&#x27; musical version of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1973), as Muff Potter, the town drunk. He also starred in &quot;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&quot; (1960), &quot;Return of the Seven&quot; (1966), &quot;The Split&quot; (1968), &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1973), &quot;Drum&quot; (1976), and played the title role in a 1971 crime drama, &quot;Chandler&quot;. Oates costarred three times with friend Peter Fonda in &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971), &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (1975), and &quot;92 in the Shade&quot; (1975).

Oates was cast in Roger Donaldson&#x27;s 1977 New Zealand film &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; together with New Zealand actor Sam Neill. A political thriller with action film elements, &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; follows the lead character &quot;Smith&quot; (Neill) as New Zealand plunges into a police state, as a fascist government institutes martial law after industrial disputes flare into violence. Smith gets caught between the special police and a growing resistance movement, and reluctantly becomes involved. Oates plays the role of Willoughby, commander of the American forces stationed in New Zealand and working with the New Zealand fascist government to find and subdue &quot;rebels&quot; (the resistance movement).

A year before his death, Oates costarred with Bill Murray in the 1981 military comedy &quot;Stripes&quot;. In the role of the drill sergeant, Sgt. Hulka, Oates played the straight man to Murray&#x27;s comedic character. The film was a huge financial success, earning $85 million at the box office. In 1982, he costarred opposite Jack Nicholson in director Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Border&quot;.

In 1981, Oates also costarred as a fanatical Southern preacher-turned-Confederate officer in &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;, a CBS TV miniseries that aired in November 1982. His last two films were not released until 1983: &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; and &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, both filmed in late 1981. Both films are dedicated to him, along with Monte Hellman&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Iguana&quot;, which ends with the titles &quot;For Warren&quot;.

==Death==
Oates was ill with influenza in the weeks before his death. On April 3, 1982, at the age of 53, he died of a heart attack while taking an afternoon nap at his home in Los Angeles, after having experienced chest pains and shortness of breath earlier that day. An autopsy determined that he had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After his funeral, in accordance with Oates&#x27; wishes, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at his ranch in Montana.

==Legacy==
Oates has a dedicated cult following because of his performances in Peckinpah&#x27;s studio films and television shows, Monte Hellman&#x27;s independent works, his films with Peter Fonda, and in a number of B movies from the 1970s. During a screening of Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;, Richard Linklater introduced the film, and gave 16 reasons why viewers should love it. The sixth was: &quot;Because there was once a god who walked the Earth named Warren Oates.&quot;

The documentary film &quot;Warren Oates: Across the Border&quot; was produced by Tom Thurman in 1993 as a tribute to the actor&#x27;s career.

Oates was the subject of a 2009 biography, &quot;Warren Oates: A Wild Life&quot;, written by Susan Compo.

<doc id="1140327" wikidata="Q1424799" url="?curid=1140327" title="World Toilet Organization">
<text>The World Toilet Organization (WTO) is a global non-profit organization whose goal is to improve toilet and sanitation conditions worldwide. It was founded in 2001 with 15 members and has now grown to 151 member organizations in 53 countries. The WTO is also the organizer of the World Toilet Summit, the Urgent Run and initiated the United Nations World Toilet Day.

==History==
The World Toilet Organisation was founded by Jack Sim in Singapore on 19 November 2001.

==Initiatives==
===World Toilet Day===
World Toilet Day (WTD) was founded on 19 November 2001, and the inaugural World Toilet Summit (WTS) was held on the same day. Created by the WTO, World Toilet Day&#x27;s supreme purpose is to draw attention to the ongoing global sanitation crisis. NGOs, the private sector, civil society organizations and the international community joined in to mark the global day. The United Nations also officially recognizes this day due to the need to raise awareness about the world&#x27;s sanitation crisis.
==== Urgent Run ====
The WTO commemorates WTD annually with the Urgent Run. The Urgent Run is a call for urgent action to end the sanitation crisis and aims to bring communities around the world together to raise awareness for the global sanitation challenge and engage people with sanitation issues in their local communities. For the past few years, in the lead-up to United Nations World Toilet Day, communities worldwide have come together to organize sanitation-themed Urgent Runs in varying formats and include fun runs, educational events, toilet cleaning programs, awareness walks, carnivals and even motorbike parades. They are organized by community groups, companies, universities, volunteers and NGOs to engage their local communities on their sanitation challenges.

=== Projects supported ===
==== Rainbow School Toilet Initiative ====
WTO&#x27;s Rainbow School Toilet Initiative was launched in 2015. In 2016 four rural schools, with an estimated 1,300 students (average 300 students per school) benefited from the new toilet buildings equipped with a recyclable wastewater treatment plant.

==== Floating Community Toilet Project ====
Until 2018, no proper sanitation existed for the almost 100,000 people living in floating communities on Cambodia&#x27;s Tonlé Sap Lake. To address sanitation issues in these floating communities, Wetlands Work! (WW) developed the HandyPod, a product that contains the raw sewage and treats it by harnessing various biological processes. This project aims to eliminate open defecation by providing sanitation systems to floating schools and teaching students to use toilets; improve sanitation and hygiene; reduce school absences due to diarrhea; increase school attendance, especially for girls, as well as drive demand for household toilets.

The WTO and WW raised funds for the project through various platforms and in 2016 a total of eight HandyPods have been installed, befitting approximately 900 students and 650 indirect beneficiaries in their households.

=== World Toilet College ===
The World Toilet College (WTC) started as a social enterprise in 2005 with the belief that there is a need for an independent world body to ensure best practices and standards in toilet design, cleanliness and sanitation technologies. While the lack of toilets is an endemic problem, poor management and hygienic maintenance are equally serious issues. A well-kept toilet will encourage proper usage and prevent deadly diseases.

Since 2005, WTC has trained more than 5,000 people across its various courses and conducted programs and courses.

== Logo ==
The logo of the World Toilet Organization consists of a heart-shaped toilet seat which moves slightly up and down.

<text>Herston is an inner suburb of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Herston had a population of 2,311 people.

== Geography ==
Herston is located by car north of the Brisbane GPO.

The area of Herston includes the Herston Health Precinct on its eastern side. This includes the Royal Brisbane and Women&#x27;s Hospital, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the &quot;Herston Quarter&quot; which is a development site to replace the former Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital which moved to another site in 2014. Herston also includes the Ballymore Stadium Rugby Union venue in the northwest and Victoria Park on the southern side of Herston Road. The park includes the Victoria Park golf course and the heritage-listed former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse built in 1931.

The rest of Herston is mostly a residential suburb, with some areas of light industry near the main roads. Many of Herston&#x27;s residents are employed by the hospital or nearby at the Queensland University of Technology in Kelvin Grove. There is also a significant student population that studies at the university.

The Herston Quarter is a development site in Herston adjacent to the Royal Brisbane and Women&#x27;s Hospital on the site of the former Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital which was merged into the Queensland Children&#x27;s Hospital in South Brisbane. The site includes the restoration of the historic Royal Brisbane Hospital Nurses&#x27; Homes.

== History ==
Herston was first settled by Europeans in the 1850s. Sir Robert Herbert, Queensland&#x27;s first premier, built a farm in the area, and lived in the farmhouse with his then Attorney-General, John Bramston. They named their house &quot;Herston&quot;, a combination of their surnames, which eventually became the name of the suburb. It has been speculated that the two men may have been in a kind of homosexual relationship at the time or at least a kind of very strong and intimate male friendship.

Many of Herston&#x27;s streets were named after local identities of the time. Bowen Bridge Road and Bowen Park were named after Sir George Bowen, Queensland&#x27;s first governor. Butterfield Street was named after local schoolmaster William Butterfield. Hetherington Street was named after coal industry identity John William Hetherington, and Garrick Terrace got its name from James Francis Garrick, the man who purchased Herston from Herbert and Bramston.

Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital Special School opened on 11 August 1919. As the name suggests, the school provided education to children who were patients in the hospital. On 1 December 2014 it became the Royal Brisbane and ACT for Kids Campus of the Lady Cilento Children&#x27;s Hospital School. On 1 January 2019 it became a campus of the Queensland Children&#x27;s Hospital School (reflecting the name change of the Lady Cilento Children&#x27;s Hospital).

St Joan of Arc Catholic church opened on Sunday 5 December 1920 when it was blessed and opened by Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig. St Joan of Arc Catholic School opened on 14 July 1924 under the Sisters of the Presentation. The school closed in 1968.

From the eastern side of the suburb was served by frequent tram services along Bowen Bridge Road, with routes converging from Chermside, Kalinga (until 1962), Stafford, and Grange. These services combined to provide the suburb with an off-peak service of a tram every 2½ minutes along Bowen Bridge Road in the late 1950s. This service ceased in December 1968. From the western side of the suburb was served by trams which ran along Kelvin Grove Road. This service also ceased in December 1968.

Herston Methodist Church opened on Saturday 24 March 1923 on the corner of Aberleigh and Scott Roads (). It was an unpretentious hardwood building . The church was still operating in 1990 but had closed prior to March 2020.

On 13 October 1928 St Luke&#x27;s Anglican Mission Hall was dedicated by Archbishop Gerald Sharp. Although Herston was within the parish of Holy Trinity Church at Fortitude Valley, Herston residents had wanted a closer place of worship. The mission hall was in a converted residence with the front rooms being used as a chapel and a Sunday School. A new church was dedicated on 29 April 1962 by Archbishop Reginald Halse and consecrated on 18 October 1964 by Archbishop Philip Strong. Its closure on 7 May 1993 was approved by Assistant Bishop Wood. It was located on the corner of Wyndham and Weightman Streets ().

Between 1953 and November 1968, the suburb was also served by Brisbane City Council trolley-buses which connected the suburb with Fortitude Valley and ran through to Stanley Bridge in East Brisbane. The trolley-buses ran along Herston Road and Butterfield Street, past Ballymore football ground, terminating near the intersection of Prospect Terrace and Kelvin Grove Road.

Wattlebrae Hospital School opened on circa 1957 and closed on circa 1958.
In 2009, a decision was made to merge the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital with Mater Children&#x27;s Hospital in Stanley Street, South Brisbane to create a single children&#x27;s hospital in Brisbane. The decision was very controversial with many people opposed to the merger, while others supported the merge but argued over location of the new hospital (some favouring the Herston site and other favouring the South Brisbane site). The Queensland Children&#x27;s Hospital opened on 29 November 2014, adjacent to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, in South Brisbane, with the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital and the Mater Children&#x27;s Hospital closing immediately as their patients were transferred to the Queensland Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In November 2014, the Queensland Government sought applications from developers to develop the site into a mixed-use precinct which would complement the adjacent health and educational facilities. Three lead developers were short-listed in July 2015. On 1 October 2015, the government issued a call for detailed proposals from the two remaining shortlisted parties to develop the site, Stockland having withdrawn. The remaining proponents were Frasers Property Australia with Australian Unity and Lend Lease with Trinity Health. On 9 December 2015, the government announced that part of the development would include a government-funded Specialist Rehabilitation and Ambulatory Care Centre (SRACC) with 100 rehabilitation beds and 32-day surgery beds with seven operating theatres and three endoscopy rooms.

The project to redevelop the Herston Quarter site is expected to cost the Queensland Government over ten years to develop a mixed health, aged care, residential and retail precinct. On 14 August 2016, Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that Australian Unity had won the tender for the redevelopment, and there were expected to be 700 construction jobs and 1000 ongoing jobs on the site. It was announced to include a 132-bed specialist rehabilitation and ambulatory care centre for burns, stroke and other recovering patients. Further stages will have a private hospital for day-surgery, a residential aged-care home for over 100 people, research facilities, accommodation for 250 medical students, nurses scientists and visiting experts. The development will be overseen by the Metro North Hospital and Health Service.

On 25 August 2016, HASSELL was announced as the design partner for the Herston Quarter project. Watpac was announced as the builder.

The Herston Quarter was declared a &quot;Priority Development Area&quot; (PDA) on 18 November 2016 by the Queensland Government under the &quot;Economic Development Act 2012&quot;. The declaration of a PDA removes the affected land from the planning and development processes of both the &quot;Sustainable Planning Act 2009&quot; and &quot;Brisbane City Plan 2014&quot;. The PDA is managed by Economic Development Queensland within the Department of Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning. In addition, an Interim Land Use Plan was prepared to fast-track the development of a Specialist Rehabilitation and Ambulatory Care Centre. On 6 July 2017 the PDS (Proposed Development Scheme) was released for consultation.

On 6 August 2017, the State Government released development plans for the Herston Quarter project.

<doc id="1140356" wikidata="Q2558698" url="?curid=1140356" title="World Toilet Day">
<text>World Toilet Day (WTD) is an official United Nations international observance day on 19 November to inspire action to tackle the global sanitation crisis. Worldwide, 4.2 billion people live without &quot;safely managed sanitation&quot; and around 673 million people practice open defecation. Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to &quot;Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all&quot;. In particular, target 6.2 is to &quot;End open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene&quot;. When the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 was published, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said, &quot;Today, Sustainable Development Goal 6 is badly off track&quot; and it &quot;is hindering progress on the 2030 Agenda, the realization of human rights and the achievement of peace and security around the world&quot;.

World Toilet Day exists to inform, engage and inspire people to take action toward achieving this goal. The UN General Assembly declared World Toilet Day an official UN day in 2013, after Singapore had tabled the resolution (its first resolution before the UN&#x27;s General Assembly of 193 member states). Prior to that, World Toilet Day had been established unofficially by the World Toilet Organization (a Singapore-based NGO) in 2001.

UN-Water is the official convener of World Toilet Day. UN-Water maintains the official World Toilet Day website and chooses a special theme for each year. In 2020 the theme was &quot;Sustainable sanitation and climate change&quot;. In 2019 the theme was &#x27;Leaving no one behind&#x27;, which is the central theme of the Sustainable Development Goals. Themes in previous years include nature-based solutions, wastewater, toilets and jobs, and toilets and nutrition. World Toilet Day is marked by communications campaigns and other activities. Events are planned by UN entities, international organizations, local civil society organizations and volunteers to raise awareness and inspire action.

Toilets are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on public health, human dignity, and personal safety, especially for females. Sanitation systems that do not safely treat excreta (feces) allow the spread of disease. Serious soil-transmitted diseases and waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, dysentery and schistosomiasis can result.

== Convener ==


In 2013, UN-Water and the &quot;Thematic Priority Area (TPA) on Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation&quot; received the mandate to oversee World Toilet Day each year. This mandate is described in the United Nations Resolution A/67/L.75.

In consultation with the UN-Water World Toilet Day Task Force, made up of UN-Water member organizations, UN-Water selects the theme based on that year&#x27;s World Water Development Report and develops content for World Toilet Day communications campaigns.

UN-Water manages the World Toilet Day website which promotes key issues and stories, provides communications and campaigns resources, and announces events and opportunities to participate.

The overall World Toilet Day campaign mobilizes civil society, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, academics, corporations and the general public to participate in the associated social media and communications campaigns. Ultimately, the aim is to encourage organizations and governments to plan activities and action on sanitation issues to make progress on Sustainable Development Goal 6.

== Annual themes ==

Starting in 2012, World Toilet Day themes were selected for each year and form the basis of the related communications campaigns. Since 2016, the same overall annual theme has been used for both World Toilet Day and World Water Day, based on the World Water Development Report. 
* 2012 – &quot;I give a shit, do you?&quot; (slogan)
* 2013 – Tourism and water
* 2014 – Equality and dignity
* 2015 – Toilets and nutrition
* 2016 – Toilets and jobs
* 2017 – Wastewater
*2018 – Nature-based solutions (slogan: &quot;When Nature calls&quot;)
* 2019 – Leaving no one behind – The campaign draws attention to those people being &quot;left behind without sanitation and the social, economic and environmental consequences of inaction&quot;. This is closely related to Sustainable Development Goal 6 which has a target to eliminate open defecation and ensure &quot;everyone has access to sustainable sanitation services by 2030, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations&quot;.
* 2020 – Sustainable sanitation and climate change
* 2021 – Valuing toilets: The WTO and Bill Gates both believe that if value can be given to toilet waste, then funds will be generated to pay for any cleanup including profits for entrepreneurs interested in investing in related industries.
* 2022 – Groundwater and sanitation – making the invisible visible.
* 2023 - Accelerating Change
* 2024 - Toilets are a place for peace.

== Examples of activities and events ==

=== Launch of reports ===
Some organizations launch toilet-related (or sanitation-related) reports on World Toilet Day. For example:
* The Toilet Board Coalition (2017) &quot;Sanitation Economy&quot;
* Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) (2017) &quot;Guide to strengthening the enabling environment for faecal sludge management&quot;
* The International Labour Office (ILO) (2016) &quot;WASH@Work: self-training handbook
* WHO, UNICEF and USAID (2015) &quot;Improving Nutrition Outcomes with Better Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Practical Solutions for Policies and Programmes&quot;

=== Events ===

*2019: Planned events for World Toilet Day 2019 include for example a workshop in the USA entitled &quot;Manure Management – What Poop Can Teach Youth!&quot;, art installations in Ireland under the theme &quot;Think Before You Flush&quot;, and a &quot;Toilets for all Campaign in Rural areas&quot; in Madhya Pradesh, India.
*2018: Events for World Toilet Day in 2018 included diverse activities such as a &#x27;hackathon&#x27; in Ghana to promote digital solutions, a seminar hosted by Engineers without Borders in Denmark, a screening and discussion of the Bollywood movie &quot;&quot; (in English – &quot;Toilet: A Love Story&quot;) in Canada, and a school drawing competition in India.
* 2017: Members of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) used the momentum around World Toilet Day in 2017 to update Wikipedia articles on WASH-related topics. This contributed to public education about the sanitation crisis. The documentary &quot;Follow the Flush,&quot; released 19 November 2017, educated people about what happens beneath the streets of New York City after a person flushes a toilet in Manhattan. In the lead-up to World Toilet Day 2017, communities worldwide came together for sanitation-themed &quot;Urgent Runs&quot;. More than 63 events were held in 42 countries. Events included fun runs, awareness walks, toilet cleaning programs, carnivals and even motorbike parades. Countries participating include: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, China, Congo-Brazzaville, France, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, United States and Vietnam.

==Impacts==
=== Social media impacts ===
The World Toilet Day campaign and related publications reach millions of people through social media, dedicated websites and other channels. Over 100 events in 40 countries were registered on the World Toilet Day website in both 2016 and in 2017. In 2017, the hashtag #WorldToiletDay had a maximum potential reach of over 750 million people on social media. In 2018, the maximum potential reach increased by 15%,compared to 2017; the online activity and authors also increased by 12% and 22% compared to 2017, respectively.

== History ==
On 19 November 2001, the NGO World Toilet Organization (WTO) was founded by Jack Sim, a philanthropist from Singapore. He subsequently declared 19 November as World Toilet Day. The name &quot;World Toilet Day&quot; and not &quot;World Sanitation Day&quot; was chosen for ease of public messaging, even though toilets are only the first stage of sanitation systems.

World Toilet Day events and public awareness campaigns increase public awareness of the broader sanitation systems that include wastewater treatment, fecal sludge management, municipal solid waste management, stormwater management, hygiene, and handwashing. Also, the UN Sustainable Development Goals call for more than just toilets. Goal 6 calls for adequate sanitation, which includes the whole system for assuring that waste is safely processed.

The WTO began pushing for global recognition for World Toilet Day and, in 2007, the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) began to actively support World Toilet Day, too. Their efforts to raise attention for the sanitation crisis were bolstered in 2010 when the human right to water and sanitation was officially declared a human right by the UN.

In 2013, a joint initiative between the Government of Singapore and the World Toilet Organization led to Singapore&#x27;s first ever UN resolution, named &quot;Sanitation for All&quot;. The resolution calls for collective action to end the world&#x27;s sanitation crisis. World Toilet Day was declared an official UN day in 2013. That resolution was adopted by 122 countries at the 67th session of the UN General Assembly in New York.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2016. On World Toilet Day on 19 November 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged broad action to renew efforts to provide access to adequate sanitation for all. He reminded everyone of the &quot;Call to Action on Sanitation&quot; which was launched in 2013, and the aim to end open defecation by 2025. He also said: &quot;By many accounts, sanitation is the most-missed target of the Millennium Development Goals.&quot;

The UN Deputy Secretary-General, Jan Eliasson, was honored on World Toilet Day in 2016 in New York for his deep commitment to breaking the sanitation taboo. For example, he had delivered a video message to attendees of a WaterAid and Unilever joint event in the European Parliament on World Toilet Day 2014. In 2016, UN-Water supported &quot;A Toast for Toilets&quot; in New York with the United Nations Mission of Singapore.

==Background==

Worldwide, 4.2 billion people live without &quot;safely managed sanitation&quot; and around 673 million people worldwide practice open defecation. Having to urinate in the open can also be difficult for women and girls. Females tend to resort to the cover of darkness to give them more privacy, but then risk being attacked when alone at night.

It has been estimated that 58% of all cases of diarrhea worldwide in 2015 were caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate handwashing. This resulted in half a million children under the age of five dying from diarrhea per year. Providing sanitation has been estimated to lower the odds of children suffering diarrhea by 7–17%, and under-five mortality by 5–20%.

The Human Right to Water and Sanitation was recognized as a human right by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on 28 July 2010. Lack of access to sanitation (toilets) has an impact on public health, dignity, and safety. The spread of many diseases (e.g. soil-transmitted helminthiasis, diarrhea, schistosomiasis) and stunted growth in children is directly related to people being exposed to human feces because toilets are either not available or not used.

Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to provide sanitation for all.

<text>The 1985 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1985 season. The 82nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Kansas City Royals and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Royals upset the heavily favored Cardinals in seven games. The Series was popularly known as the &quot;Show-Me Series&quot; or the &quot;I-70 Showdown Series,&quot; as both cities are in the state of Missouri which is nicknamed the &quot;Show Me State&quot; and are connected by Interstate 70.

The Cardinals won the NL East division by three games over the New York Mets, then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers four games to two in the NL Championship Series. The Royals won the AL West division by one game over the California Angels, then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays four games to three in the AL Championship Series.

The Cardinals were seeking to win their NL-leading 10th World Series title, while the Royals were seeking their first World Series title. The Royals were completing one of the most successful decades by any expansion team, with six division titles and two pennants from 1976 to 1985. This was the first World Series in which all games were played at night. Also, this was the second all-Missouri World Series; the first in was all-St. Louis series between the Cardinals and Browns (a decade later, they became the Baltimore Orioles). This was the second of five World Series played completely on artificial turf; the first was in and the others were in , and 2020.

This is the most recent World Series in which the designated hitter was not used in an AL baseball park. From to 1985, the DH was used in all games in even-numbered years. In odd-numbered years, like this World Series, the pitchers from both were required to bat for themselves throughout the series, as in the National League. Beginning with the next World Series, the DH rule was used only at the AL representative&#x27;s park.

The 1985 World Series is best remembered for an incorrect safe call made by first base umpire Don Denkinger in Game 6. With St. Louis leading the World Series 3-2 and in possession of a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning, Denkinger incorrectly called Jorge Orta safe. The Royals won the game 2-1 on a two-run walk-off single and then won Game 7 by a score of 11-0.

The 1985 World Series marked the fifth time in World Series history that a team came back from a three games to one deficit to win a championship, and the first in which that team lost the first two games of the series at home (in the following year&#x27;s Series, the New York Mets won after losing the first two series games at home). Bret Saberhagen&#x27;s victories in Games 3 and 7, allowing only a single run across his two starts, earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.

In their 17th season, the Royals won their first World Series title; their next appearance was 29 years later in against the San Francisco Giants, but they lost in seven games. A year later, the Royals won their second title, over the New York Mets.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
When Lonnie Smith led off for the Royals, he became the first player in MLB history to be traded from a team (the St. Louis Cardinals) during a season and play against that team in the World Series the same season.

John Tudor scattered seven hits in innings for the Cards and won with relief help from Todd Worrell. The Royals struck first in the second on Steve Balboni&#x27;s RBI single with runners on first and second, but the Cardinals tied it off of Danny Jackson in the third on Willie McGee&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third. Next inning, Tito Landrum doubled with one out, then scored on late-season acquisition César Cedeño&#x27;s RBI double to give Jackson the loss despite Jackson throwing seven innings of two-run ball. The Cardinals padded their lead in the ninth off of Dan Quisenberry when Tom Herr singled to lead off and scored on Jack Clark&#x27;s double.

This was the first Saturday night game in World Series history. The Series began on a Saturday from 1969 through 1976, and again from 1985 through 2006 (with the exception of 1990, which began on a Tuesday night).

===Game 2===
The Royals went up 2–0 in the fourth off of Danny Cox when Willie Wilson hit a leadoff single that was followed by back-to-back RBI doubles by George Brett and Frank White. However Charlie Leibrandt continued a history of tough luck in the postseason. The previous year, he had lost Game 3 of the 1984 ALCS, 1–0, to the Detroit Tigers when he pitched a three-hit complete game. He lost Game 4 in the 1985 ALCS in the ninth inning. Clinging to a two-run lead in the ninth of this game, manager Dick Howser opted to not send in his relief ace Dan Quisenberry to close out the game. Leibrandt allowed a leadoff double to Willie McGee, then was only one out from tying the series at one apiece when he allowed an RBI single to Jack Clark. After a double and walk loaded the bases, Terry Pendleton cleared them with a double and gave the Cardinals a 4–2 lead. Quisenberry came in and after he walked Darrell Porter he got out of the inning. Jeff Lahti earned a save with a scoreless bottom of the inning. The Cardinals&#x27; four run ninth would be the only inning in the series in which they scored more than one run.

===Game 3===
The Royals got back into the series by riding ace Bret Saberhagen to a 6–1 victory against twenty-game winner Joaquín Andújar. Saberhagen flashed messages on the television screen to his pregnant wife who was due to give birth any day. She eventually gave birth on October 26 (in Game 6). The Royals went up 2–0 in the fourth on Lonnie Smith&#x27;s two-run double that scored Jim Sundberg and Buddy Biancalana, who had walked and singled, respectively. Royals second baseman Frank White made history by becoming the first second baseman in the history of the World Series to hit in the clean-up spot in the batting order. White came through with a two-run home run off of Andújar in the fifth after George Brett got on base. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game in the sixth off of Bret Saberhagen on consecutive singles by Ozzie Smith, Tom Herr, and Jack Clark. The Royals padded their lead in the seventh off of Ricky Horton when George Brett drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a balk, then scored on White&#x27;s double. Two outs later, White scored on Buddy Biancalana&#x27;s single to cap the scoring.

===Game 4===
John Tudor&#x27;s complete game shutout put the Cardinals on the verge of winning their second World Series in four years. Tito Landrum, only playing due to a tarp injury to Vince Coleman, continued to make his case for series MVP with a home run in the second off of Bud Black. Next inning, Willie McGee homered also to make it 2–0 Cardinals, who added to their lead in the fifth when Terry Pendleton tripled with one out and scored on Black&#x27;s throwing error on Tom Nieto&#x27;s bunt attempt. The best chance for the Royals to score was in the seventh inning, when they loaded the bases on two singles and a walk. With pinch-hitter Hal McRae up for Buddy Biancalana, he grounded to the third baseman to end the threat. Tudor allowed just five hits in a complete game while striking out eight with one walk while Black went just five innings and allowing three runs on four hits and three walks.

===Game 5===
Entering this game, the Royals were 3–0 in must-win games in playoff elimination games. They improved their record to 4–0 with a decisive victory over the Cardinals, again by the score of 6–1. The Royals struck first on Frank White&#x27;s groundout with runners on second and third in the top of the first off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied it off of Danny Jackson in the bottom half on back-to-back two-out doubles by Tom Herr and Jack Clark. However, they would not score after that. The Royals broke the game open in the second when Buddy Biancalana singled to score Jim Sundberg, who doubled with one out. After Lonnie Smith walked, Willie Wilson tripled home both runs to make it 4–1. The Royals added to their lead in the eighth off of Jeff Lahti on shortstop Ozzie Smith&#x27;s throwing error on Danny Jackson&#x27;s ground ball, then in the ninth on Pat Sheridan&#x27;s RBI double. Jackson was the winning pitcher, following the same formula and pitching rotation as the Royals did in the ALCS where Jackson also won Game 5. Jackson threw an immaculate inning in the 7th, becoming the only pitcher to do so during a postseason game to date. Jackson scattered five hits, allowing only one run in a complete game.

===Game 6===
A pitcher&#x27;s duel unfolded between Danny Cox and Charlie Leibrandt, the tough-luck loser in Game 2. The game was marked by controversy. In the fourth inning of the scoreless game, the Royals&#x27; Frank White may have stolen second base, but was ruled out in a close call. The batter, Pat Sheridan, hit a single to right field two pitches later. If White had been on base when Sheridan singled, the Royals would have likely taken a 1–0 lead. Instead, Leibrandt and Cox traded scoreless innings until the eighth, when pinch-hitter Brian Harper singled home Terry Pendleton, who had singled earlier, to give the Cardinals a 1–0 lead.

The Cardinals&#x27; 1–0 lead entering the bottom of the eighth was the result of St. Louis taking the upper hand after two situations that were mirror images of each other: In consecutive half-innings – the bottom of the seventh and the top of the eighth – both teams had runners on first and second with their respective starting pitcher coming to bat. Kansas City manager Dick Howser opted to leave Leibrandt in the game to bat, but the Royals starter struck out to end the inning. In contrast, Whitey Herzog pulled Cardinals starter Cox for pinch hitter Harper, who then had the game&#x27;s first hit with runners in scoring position to put St. Louis ahead 1–0.

In the bottom of the ninth, Herzog called on rookie reliever Todd Worrell to relieve setup man Ken Dayley, who had pitched the eighth and would have been the winner had the Cardinals won. The first batter, pinch-hitter Jorge Orta, sent a chopping bouncer to the right of Jack Clark. He tossed the ball to Worrell, who tagged the bag ahead of Orta, but Clark&#x27;s toss was behind Worrell, causing the running Orta to come between umpire Don Denkinger and his view of the lunging Worrell&#x27;s glove. Denkinger called Orta safe. TV replays – not used by officials for play review until 2008 – indicated that Orta should have been called out, and an argument ensued on the field. The Cardinals argued briefly, but as crew chief and believing he had made the correct call, Denkinger did not reverse it. Orta remained at first. In his book &quot;You&#x27;re Missing a Great Game&quot;, Herzog wrote that he later wished he had asked Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who was in attendance, to overrule the call and declare Orta out. If Ueberroth had refused to do so, Herzog would have pulled his team from the field and forfeited the game.

Instead of one out and no one on, the Royals now had no outs and a runner on first for batter Steve Balboni. Balboni lifted a pop-up in foul territory along the edge of the first base dugout. Jack Clark, who had only recently made the transition from right field to first base that season, lost track of the ball as he looked to find the dugout and the ball dropped on the top step of the dugout. Balboni then singled two pitches later, putting runners at first and second with nobody out. Onix Concepción was sent in as a pinch runner for the slow-footed Balboni. Catcher Jim Sundberg attempted to sacrifice the runners over, but he failed. With two strikes, he bunted anyway, and sent it back to Worrell, who threw to third to force out Orta, the only out the Cardinals would record. Porter then allowed a passed ball, advancing Concepción and Sundberg to third and second, respectively.

With first base now open and two runners in scoring position, Herzog then chose to walk Royals pinch hitter Hal McRae to set up a potential double play. McRae was replaced by the faster John Wathan to pinch-run to avoid a potential double play. With the bases loaded and one out, Royals pinch hitter Dane Iorg (a former Cardinal who had won a championship ring with them in 1982) blooped a single to right field. Concepción scored the tying run and Sundberg approached the plate with the winning run. Right fielder Andy Van Slyke&#x27;s throw was on target, but Sundberg slid home safely with the game-winning run.

The Royals celebrated the rally, and mobbed home plate. The Cardinals went to their dressing rooms, only to find champagne waiting for them and plastic over their lockers in anticipation for the celebration that never came. Denkinger stated that he still believed he had made the right call until he later met with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after the game and had the opportunity to see the replay himself. He would later claim that he was waiting to hear the ball land in Worrell&#x27;s glove while watching the bag for Orta&#x27;s foot. Due to the crowd noise in Royals Stadium, he ruled Orta safe because he never heard Worrell catch the ball. &quot;I was in good position, but Worrell is tall, the throw was high, and I couldn&#x27;t watch his glove and his feet at the same time,&quot; Denkinger told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. &quot;It was a soft toss, and there was so much crowd noise, I couldn&#x27;t hear the ball hit the glove.&quot; ABC showed the play from three different angles; two were high above the field and one was from behind third base, all with what Denkinger claimed he didn&#x27;t get: a clear view of Clark&#x27;s throw and Worrell&#x27;s catch. Denkinger was scheduled to be the home plate umpire in Game 7.

===Game 7===
One night after becoming a father, Bret Saberhagen tossed a five-hitter and got all the offense he needed when Darryl Motley homered to left off John Tudor in the second inning, after a walk to Steve Balboni. In the third, Lonnie Smith led off with a walk, and with one out George Brett hit an infield single. After a double steal, Tudor issued walks to Frank White to load the bases and Jim Sundberg to force in Smith, making it 3–0. Tudor was replaced with Bill Campbell after only innings. Balboni singled to left off Campbell to score Brett and White to make it 5–0. Tudor walked four and was charged with all five runs. In the dugout, he angrily punched an electrical fan, cutting his pitching hand.

The Royals blew the game open in the bottom of the fifth. A succession of five Cardinal pitchers allowed six Royals runs, five coming after two were out. Campbell gave up a single to Sundberg and was immediately replaced by Jeff Lahti, who allowed four hits to score four runs before being replaced by Ricky Horton. After Horton gave up a single to Brett and fell behind on the count 2-0 to Frank White, Herzog replaced him with Joaquín Andújar, normally a starter but pressed into relief. Andújar allowed an RBI single to White, increasing the Royals lead to 10–0. With Sundberg at the plate (the Royals had batted around), Andújar twice charged home plate umpire Denkinger to disagree with his strike zone. First, Denkinger called an Andújar pitch a ball. Herzog, who had been berating Denkinger for most of the game, rushed from the dugout to defend Andújar, and was ejected — reportedly after saying to Denkinger, &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t even be here if you hadn&#x27;t missed the fucking call last night!&quot; According to Denkinger, he replied, &quot;Well, if you guys weren&#x27;t hitting .120 in this World Series, we wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot; The next pitch was also called a ball to walk Sundberg, and Denkinger ejected Andújar, who then charged at Denkinger. It took three teammates to restrain him and get him off the field. Andújar was suspended for the first ten games of the 1986 season for his outburst. Although it has been rumored that Herzog sent in Andújar specifically to bait Denkinger, Herzog himself has said several times that Andújar was the only pitcher who still had anything left in his arm. After Game 5 loser Bob Forsch&#x27;s first pitch was wild to score Brett, he got out of the fifth-inning nightmare. He pitched a clean sixth inning and Ken Dayley kept the Royals off the scoreboard for the last two innings, but it was not enough as the Cardinals could not score against Saberhagen.

The Cardinals&#x27; .185 batting average was the lowest for a seven-game World Series until the New York Yankees hit .183 in the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Cardinals also scored only thirteen total runs—an all-time low for a seven-game series—scoring only once in the final 26 innings of the series. If they had held on for the win in Game 6, they still would have been outscored in the series 15–13.

This was Kansas City&#x27;s second major professional sports championship, joining the Chiefs&#x27; victory in Super Bowl IV in January 1970. These franchises have since added four more championships, with the Royals winning the 2015 World Series, and the Chiefs winning Super Bowls LIV, LVII and LVIII.

==Composite box==
1985 World Series (4–3): Kansas City Royals (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)
==Broadcasting==
ABC televised the series, with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentators Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver. This was the first World Series broadcast for McCarver, who would go on to call a record 24 World Series telecasts with ABC, CBS and Fox. Howard Cosell was originally scheduled to be in the booth with Michaels and Palmer, but was removed from his assignment just prior to Game 1 because of the controversy surrounding his book &quot;I Never Played the Game&quot;.

CBS Radio broadcast the series nationally, with Jack Buck on play-by-play and Sparky Anderson providing color commentary. Locally, Royals&#x27; flagship station WIBW (Topeka) aired the games in Kansas City with Denny Matthews and Fred White alternating on play-by-play and color, while in St. Louis the Cardinals&#x27; flagship KMOX simulcast the CBS Radio coverage due to Buck&#x27;s status as the team&#x27;s primary local announcer during the regular season, although regular analyst Mike Shannon was sidelined in favor of Anderson.

==Aftermath==
The Royals became the first team ever to win the World Series after losing the first two games at home. The following year, the New York Mets accomplished the same feat by defeating the Boston Red Sox in seven games in the World Series. In the 1996 World Series, the New York Yankees lost their first two games at home against the defending 1995 World Series champion Atlanta Braves before winning four straight to claim the title. The Royals also were the fifth team in MLB history to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series, the previous teams being the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates, 1958 New York Yankees, 1968 Detroit Tigers, and the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates. The 1985 Royals had also come back from a three games to one deficit to win the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, making them the first and so far only team to do so (the championship series had changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in 1985). The six elimination games won by the Royals represent a Major League record for a single postseason, a record which would later be equaled by the 2012 San Francisco Giants. The Royals also became the first team to win two Game 7s in one postseason. The 2017 Houston Astros are the only other team to achieve this feat.

In the immediate aftermath of the 1985 World Series, umpire Don Denkinger received many hateful letters from Cardinals fans due to his blown call in Game 6 that essentially cost the Cardinals a World Series. Denkinger contacted Major League Baseball Security, which in turn contacted the FBI, when he received a particularly menacing letter with no return address that said that if the writer saw Denkinger in person, he would &quot;blow him away&quot; with a .357 Magnum. According to Denkinger, FBI agents visited the letter writer and told him, &quot;You&#x27;re done. This is the end of it. You will not correspond with him in any manner, and life will go on.&quot;

Denkinger had other big umpiring assignments after the 1985 Series. He was behind the plate for the All-Star Game the following season, and he was named crew chief for the 1988 ALCS, 1991 World Series, and 1992 ALCS. He retired in 1998, ironically with his last game being at Kauffman Stadium on June 2, 1998. After retirement, Denkinger would lean into his fame of the blown call, regularly appearing at sports memorabilia shows (including ones in St. Louis) willing to autograph photos depicting &quot;The Call&quot;. Nevertheless, many publications consider his blown call in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series one of the biggest umpire blunders in MLB history.

In 1987, the Cardinals won the NLCS in seven games over the San Francisco Giants. In the World Series against the Minnesota Twins, after having fallen behind 2-0 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, they won their next three games at home. However, back at the Metrodome, they lost the last two and again fell one game short of a World Series title. It would be the Cardinals&#x27; last World Series appearance until 2004. The Cardinals did not win another World Series until 2006.

The Royals did not play in another postseason game until the 2014 American League Wild Card Game, and did not win another World Series until the following season, in 2015.

The introduction of interleague play to major league baseball in 1997 allowed the I-70 Series to be revived in regular season games each year. Through the 2022 season, the Cardinals lead the regular-season interleague series, 73-47, though Kansas City still holds the World Series win over St. Louis, as it was the last and only time the two teams have faced off in the postseason.

<text>Penzberg (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Benschberg&quot;) is a city (although some see it as a town) in the Weilheim-Schongau district, in Bavaria, Germany. It is located about 50 km south of Munich, and had a population of around 17,000 in 2020. A historic coal mining town, Penzberg today is known for its pharmaceutical industries.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Poennesperch&quot; in a 1275 contract, when it was sold to the Benediktbeuern Abbey. Surface coal mining had already started in the 16th century, though it was ended by the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the industrial exploitation of coal did not begin until 1800. In 1919 Penzberg received town privileges.

===World War 2===
An allied air raid on 16 November 1944 severely damaged the town, including the parish church, but did not affect the local coal mine, the heart of the town&#x27;s economic life.

In order to follow Hitler&#x27;s &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy (Nero Decree), the local Nazi leaders wanted to blow up the coal mine which was the economic life blood of the town (&quot;The End: Hitler&#x27;s Germany 1944–45&quot; by Ian Kershaw – p344), so, on 28 April 1945 (the social democratic mayor of Penzberg until the Nazi takeover in 1933) and others deposed the Nazi mayor. However, it was not long before the officer commanding a local Wehrmacht unit had the leaders of the revolt arrested. When, on the evening of the same day, Gauleiter Paul Giesler heard about the incident, he gave orders that the leaders were to be shot immediately without trial. To achieve this, a Werwolf group, around 100 strong, was dispatched, storming the town hall. They arrested and shot Rummer and seven fellows. During the night, a further eight suspected resistance fighters were hanged by a &quot;drumhead court-martial&quot; under SA brigade leader . Among the victims were two women, one of them pregnant. The very next day, the Americans arrived. The massacre is known as the &quot;&quot; (Night of Penzberg Murder). The mine was not destroyed, and remained open until 1966 when it closed for economic reasons; the adjacent power plant was also shut down in 1971.

==Transport==
The town is served by Penzberg station on the Kochelsee Railway.

==Important buildings==

<doc id="1140368" wikidata="Q1479952" url="?curid=1140368" title="Kadamba dynasty">
<text>The Kadambas were an ancient royal family from modern Karnataka, India, that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district in India. The kingdom was founded by Mayurasharma in , and at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. An indication of their imperial ambitions is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers, and the marital relations they kept with other kingdoms and empires, such as the Vakatakas and Guptas of northern India. Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with the help of some native tribes and claimed sovereignty. The Kadamba power reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma. 

The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with autonomy. From the mid-6th century the dynasty continued to rule as a vassal of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties. Notable among these are the Kadambas of Goa, the Kadambas of Halasi and the Kadambas of Hangal. During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled the Karnataka region, the Mauryas and later the Satavahanas, were not natives of the region and therefore the nucleus of power resided outside present-day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil, at an administrative level. In the History of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad-based historical starting point in the study of the development of the region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language.

==History==
===Origin===

There are several legends regarding the origin of the Kadambas. According to one such legend the originator of this dynasty was a three-eyed four-armed warrior called Trilochana Kadamba (the father of Mayurasharma) who emerged from the sweat of the god Shiva under a Kadamba tree. Another legend tries to simplify it by claiming Mayurasharma himself was born to Shiva and Bhudevi (goddess of the earth). Other legends tie them without any substance to the Nagas, and the Nandas of northern India. An inscription of claims that Kadamba Rudra, the founder of the kingdom, was born in a forest of Kadamba trees. As he had &quot;peacock feather&quot;-like reflections on his limbs, he was called Mayuravarman. From the Talagunda inscription, one more legend informs that the founding king of the dynasty, Mayurasharma was anointed by &quot;the six-faced god of war Skanda&quot;.

Historians are divided on the issue of the geographical origin of the Kadambas, whether they were of local origin or earlier immigrants from northern India. The social order (caste) of the Kadamba family is also an issue of debate, whether the founders of the kingdom belonged to the Brahmin caste as described by the Talagunda inscription, or of local tribal origin. Historians Chopra et al. claim the Kadambas were none other than the Kadambu tribe who were in conflict with the Chera kingdom (of modern Kerala) during the Sangam era. The Kadambas find mention in the Sangam literature as totemic worshipers of the Kadambu tree and the Hindu god Subramanya. According to R.N. Nandi, since the inscription states the family got its name by tending to the totem tree that bore the beautiful Kadamba flowers, it is an indication of their tribal origin. However the historians Sastri and Kamath claim the family belonged to the Brahmin caste, believed in the Vedas and performed Vedic sacrifices. According to the Talagunda and the Gudnapur inscriptions, they belonged to the &quot;Manavya Gotra&quot; and were &quot;Haritiputrās&quot; (&quot;descendants of &quot;Hariti&quot; lineage&quot;), which connected them to the native Chutus of Banavasi, a vassal of the Satavahana empire and the Chalukyas who succeeded them. According to Rao and Minahan, being native Kannadigas, the Kadambas promptly gave administrative and political importance to their language Kannada after coming to power.

===Birth of kingdom===
One of their earliest inscriptions, the Talagunda inscription of crown prince Santivarma () gives what may be the most possible cause for the emergence of the Kadamba kingdom. It states that Mayurasharma was a native of Talagunda, (in present-day Shimoga district of Karnataka state) and his family got its name from the Kadamba tree that grew near his home. The inscription narrates how Mayurasharma proceeded to Kanchi in along with his guru and grandfather Veerasharma to pursue his Vedic studies at a &quot;Ghatika&quot; (&quot;school&quot;). There, owing to some misunderstanding between him and a Pallava guard or at an &quot;Ashvasanstha&quot; (&quot;horse sacrifice&quot;), a quarrel arose in which Mayurasharma was humiliated. Enraged, the Brahmin discontinued his studies, left Kanchi swearing vengeance on the Pallavas and took to arms. He collected a faithful group of followers, routed the Pallava armies and &quot;Antarapalas&quot; (frontier guards) and firmly rooted himself in the dense forests of the modern Srisailam (Sriparvata) region. After a prolonged period of low intensity warfare against the Pallavas and other smaller kings such as the Brihad-Banas of Kolar region, he was able to levy tributes from the Banas and other kingdoms and finally proclaimed independence. According to Indologist Lorenz Franz Kielhorn who deciphered the Talagunda inscription, unable to contain Mayurasharma the Pallavas under king Skandavarman had to accept his sovereignty between the Arabian Sea (known as &quot;Amara&quot; or &quot;Amarawa&quot;) to &quot;Premara&quot; or &quot;Prehara&quot; which could be interpreted as either ancient Malwa in central India or the Tungabhadra or Malaprabha region in central Karnataka. According to the historian and epigraphist M. H. Krishna Iyengar a fragmentary inscription of Mayurasharma at Chandravalli which pertains to a water reservoir contained the names of Abhiras and Punnatas, two contemporary kingdoms who ruled as the northern and southern neighbors of Mayurasharma&#x27;s Kadamba kingdom. The Talagunda inscription also confirms Mayurasharma was the progenitor of the kingdom. The inscription gives a graphic description of the happenings after the Kanchi incident:
Thus, according to Ramesh, in an act of righteous indignation was born the first native kingdom of Karnataka, and the Pallava King Skandavarman condescended to recognize the growing might of the Kadambas south of the Malaprabha river as a sovereign power. Majumdar however feels even an inscription as important as the Talagunda pillar inscription leaves many a detail unanswered. Scholars such as Moraes and Sastri opine that Mayurasharma may have availed himself of the confusion in the south that was created by the invasion of Samudragupta who in his Allahabad inscription claims to have defeated Pallava King Vishnugopa of Kanchi. Taking advantage of the weakening of the Pallava power, Mayurasharma appears to have succeeded in establishing a new kingdom. According to epigraphist M.H. Krishna, Mayurasharma further subdued minor rulers such as the Traikutas, the Abhiras, the Pariyathrakas, the Shakasthanas, the Maukharis, the Punnatas and the Sendrakas. The fact that Mayurasharma had to travel to distant Kanchi for Vedic studies gives an indication that Vedic lore was quite rudimentary in the Banavasi region at that time. The Gudnapur inscription which was discovered by epigraphist B.R. Gopal states that Mauryasharma, whose grandfather and preceptor was Veerasharma and his father was Bandhushena, developed the character of a Kshatriya (warrior caste). Sen feels the successor of Mayurasharma, Kangavarma changed his surname from &quot;Sharma&quot; to &quot;Varma&quot;.

===Expansion===
Mayurasharma was succeeded by his son Kangavarma in . He had to fight the Vakataka might to protect his kingdom (also known as Kuntala country). According to Jouveau-Dubreuil he was defeated by the King Prithvisena but managed to maintain his freedom. Majumdar feels Kangavarma battled with King Vidyasena of the Basin branch of the Vakataka kingdom with no permanent results. His son Bhageerath who came to power in is said to have retrieved his fathers losses. According to Kamath, the Talagunda inscription describes Bhageerath as the sole &quot;lord of the Kadamba land&quot; and the &quot;great Sagara&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;great Ocean&quot;) himself indicating he may have retrieved their losses against the Vakatakas. But contemporary though Vakataka inscriptions do not confirm this. His son Raghu died fighting the Pallavas in though some inscriptions claim he secured the kingdom for his family. He was succeeded by his younger brother Kakusthavarma in . Kakusthavarma was the most powerful ruler of the dynasty. According to Sastri and Moraes, under the rule of Kakusthavarma, the kingdom reached its pinnacle of success and the Talagunda record calls him the &quot;ornament of the family&quot;. The Halasi and Halmidi inscriptions also hold him in high esteem.

From the Talagunda inscription it is known that he maintained marital relations with even such powerful ruling families as the imperial Guptas of the northern India. One of his daughters was married to King Madhava of the Ganga dynasty. According to the Desai one of his daughters was married to Kumara Gupta&#x27;s son Skanda Gupta (of the Gupta dynasty), and from Balaghat inscription of Vakataka king Prithvisena we know another daughter called Ajitabhattarika was married to the Vakataka prince Narendrasena. He maintained similar relations with the Bhatari vassal and the Alupas of South Canara. According to Desai and Panchamukhi evidence from Sanskrit literature indicates that during this time the notable Sanskrit poet Kalidasa visited the Kadamba court. Moraes and Sen feel the visit happened during the reign of Bhageerath. According to Sen, Kalidasa was sent by Chandragupta II Virakmaditya to conclude a marriage alliance with the Kadambas.

His successor Santivarma () was known for his personal charm and beauty. According to an inscription he wore three crowns (&quot;pattatraya&quot;) to display his prosperity, thus &quot;attracting the attention of his enemies&quot;, the Pallavas. When the Pallava threat loomed, He divided his kingdom in and let his younger brother Krishnavarma rule over the southern portion and deal with the Pallavas. The branch is called the Triparvata branch and ruled from either Devagiri in the modern Dharwad district or Halebidu. Majumdar considers Krishnavarma&#x27;s rule as somewhat obscure due to lack of his inscriptions though the records issued by his sons credit him with efficient administration and an &quot;ashvamedha&quot; (horse sacrifice). It is known that he possibly lost his life in battle with the Pallavas. According to the Hebbatta record his successor and son Vishnuvarma had to accept the suzerainty of the Pallavas despite showing initial allegiance to his uncle Santivarma ruling from Banavasi whom he described in an earlier record as &quot;lord of the entire Karnata country&quot;. In , his son Simhavarma came to power but maintained a low profile relationship with Banavasi. In the northern part of the kingdom (the Banavasi branch), Santivarma&#x27;s brother Shiva Mandhatri ruled from for more than a decade. In Santivarma&#x27;s son Mrigeshavarma came to the throne and faced the Pallavas and Gangas with considerable success. The Halasi plates describes him the &quot;destroyer of the eminent family of the Gangas&quot; and the &quot;destructive fire&quot; (&quot;pralayaanala&quot;) to the Pallavas. His queen Prabhavati of the Kekaya family bore him a son called Ravivarma. Mrigeshavarma was known to be a scholar and an expert in riding horses and elephants.

After Kakusthavarma only Ravivarma () was able to build the kingdom back to its original might during a long rule lasting up to . Numerous inscriptions from his rule, starting from fifth up to the thirty-fifth regnal years give a vivid picture of his successes which was marked by a series of clashes within the family, and also against the Pallavas and the Gangas. He is credited with a victory against the Vakatakas as well. Historian D. C. Sircar interprets Ravivarma&#x27;s Davanagere record dated (king&#x27;s last regnal year) and claims that the king&#x27;s suzerainty extended over the whole of South India as far as the Narmada river in the north and that the people of these lands sought his protection. Ravivarma donated land to a Buddhist Sangha (temple) in his 34th regnal year in to the south of the Asandi Bund (&quot;Setu&quot;) which showed his tolerance and encouragement of all faiths and religions. A Mahadeva temple constructed during his rule finds mention in a Greek writing of the period. According to the Gudnapur inscription, lesser rulers such as the Punnatas, the Alupas, the Kongalvas and the Pandyas of Uchangi were dealt with successfully. The crux of the kingdom essentially consisted of significant areas of the deccan including large parts of modern Karnataka. King Ravivarma of the Banavasi branch killed king Vishnuvarma of the Triparvata branch according to Moraes and successfully dealt with a rebelling successors of Shiva Mandhatri at Ucchangi. The Pallava king Chandadanda (another name for Pallava king Santivarman) also met the same fate according to Sathianathaier. Ravivarma left two of his brothers, Bhanuvarma and Shivaratha to govern from Halasi and Ucchangi.

===Decline===
After Ravivarma&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his peaceful son Harivarma in according to the Sangolli inscription. According to the Bannahalli plates, Harivarma was killed by a resurgent Krishnavarma II (son of Simhavarma) of the Triparvata branch around when he raided Banavasi, thus uniting the two branches of the kingdom. Around the Chalukyas who were vassals of the Kadambas and governed from Badami conquered the entire kingdom. The Kadambas thereafter became vassals of the Badami Chalukyas. In later centuries, the family fragmented into numerous minor branches and ruled from Goa, Halasi, Hangal, Vainad, Belur, Bankapura, Bandalike, Chandavar and Jayantipura (in Odisha). That the Kadambas of Banavasi were a prosperous kingdom is attested to by the famous Aihole inscription of the Chalukyas which describes Banavasi in these terms:
==Administration==

The Kadamba kings, like their predecessors the Satavahanas, called themselves &quot;Dharmamaharajas&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;Virtuous kings&quot;) and followed them closely in their administrative procedures. The kings were well read and some were even scholars and men of letters. Inscriptions describe the founding king Mayurasharma as &quot;Vedangavaidya Sharada&quot; (&quot;master of the Vedas&quot;), Vishnuvarma was known for his proficiency in grammar and logic, and Simhavarma was called &quot;skilled in the art of learning&quot;.

This wisdom and knowledge from the ancient Hindu texts called (the &quot;Smritis&quot;) provided guidance in governance. Mores identified several important positions in the government: the prime minister (&quot;Pradhana&quot;), steward of household (&quot;Manevergade&quot;), secretary of council (&quot;Tantrapala&quot; or &quot;Sabhakarya Sachiva&quot;), scholarly elders (&quot;Vidyavriddhas&quot;), physician (&quot;Deshamatya&quot;), private secretary (&quot;Rahasyadhikritha&quot;), chief secretary (&quot;Sarvakaryakarta&quot;), chief justice (&quot;Dharmadhyaksha&quot;) above whom was the king himself, other officials (&quot;Bhojaka&quot; and &quot;Ayukta&quot;), revenue officers (&quot;Rajjukas&quot;) and the writers and scribes (&quot;Lekhakas&quot;). The Gavundas formed the elite land owners who were the intermediaries between the king and the farmers collecting taxes, maintaining revenue records and providing military support to the royal family. The army consisted of officers such as &quot;Jagadala&quot;, &quot;Dandanayaka&quot; and &quot;Senapathi&quot;. The organization was based on the strategy called &quot;Chaurangabala&quot;. Guerrilla warfare was not unknown and may have been used often to gain tactical advantage.

A crown prince (&quot;Yuvaraja&quot;) from the royal family often helped the king in central administration at the royal capital. Some governed in the far off provinces. This experience not only provided future security and know-how for the king to be, but also kept administration controls within trusted family members. This is seen in the case of kings Shantivarma, Kakusthavarma and Krishnavarma. King Kakusthavarma had appointed his son Krishnavarma as viceroy of Triparvatha region. King Ravivarma&#x27;s brothers Bhanu and Shivaratha governed over Halasi and Uchangi provinces respectively. Some regions continued to be under hereditary ruling families such as the Alupas, the Sendrakas, the Kekeyas and the Bhataris. While Banavasi was the nerve center of power, Halasi, Triparvata and Uchangi were important regional capitals. The kingdom was divided into provinces (&quot;Mandalas&quot; or &quot;Desha&quot;). Under a province was a district (&quot;Vishayas&quot;), nine of which have been identified by Panchamukhi. Under a district was a Taluk (&quot;Mahagramas&quot;) comprising numerous villages under which were the villages in groups of ten (&quot;Dashagrama&quot;). The smallest unit was the village (&quot;Grama&quot;) which appears to have enjoyed particular freedoms under the authority of headman (&quot;Gramika&quot;).

Apart from the various divisions and sub-divisions of the kingdom, there was a concept of urban settlement. The fifth-century Birur copper plate inscription of king Vishnuvarma describes Banavasi as &quot;the ornament of &quot;Karnata desa&quot;, adorned with eighteen &quot;mandapikas&quot;&quot; (toll collection centers) indicating it was a major trade center at that time. Numerous inscriptions make reference to the rulers at Banavasi as &quot;excellent lords of the city&quot; (&quot;puravaresvara&quot;). Excavations have revealed that Banavasi was a settlement even during the Satavahana period. By the fifth century, it was a fortified settlement and the Kadamba capital (&quot;Kataka&quot;). A later inscriptions of of the Chalukyas refer to Banavasi and its corporate body (&quot;Nagara&quot;) as a witness to the granting of a village to a Brahmin by the monarch. A reference to the mercantile class (&quot;Setti&quot;) further indicates the commercial importance of Banavasi.

One sixth of land produce was collected as tax. Other taxes mentioned in inscriptions were the levy on land (&quot;Perjunka&quot;), social security tax paid to the royal family (&quot;Vaddaravula&quot;), sales tax (&quot;Bilkoda&quot;), land tax (&quot;Kirukula&quot;), betel tax (&quot;Pannaya&quot;) and professional taxes on traders such as oilmen, barbers and carpenters. Inscriptions mention many more taxes such as internal taxes (&quot;Kara&quot; and &quot;anthakara&quot;), tax on eleemosynary holdings (&quot;panaga&quot;), presents to kings (&quot;Utkota&quot;) and cash payments (&quot;Hiranya&quot;). The capital Banavasi had eighteen custom houses (&quot;mandapika&quot;) that levied taxes on incoming goods. In recognition of military or protective service provided by deceased warriors, the state made social service grants (&quot;Kalnad&quot; or &quot;Balgacu&quot;) that supported their family. In addition to erecting a hero stone which usually included an inscription extolling the virtues of the hero, the grant would be in the form of land. Such land grant could be as small as a plot, as large as several villages, or even a large geographical unit depending on the heroes status.

==Economy==

Inscriptions and literature are the main source of information about the economy and the factors that influenced it. According to Adiga, from studies conducted by historians and epigraphists such as Krishna, Kalburgi, Kittel, Rice, B.R. Gopal and Settar, it is clear the kingdom depended on revenues from both agricultural and pastoral elements. Numerous inscriptions, mainly from the modern Shimoga, Bijapur, Belgaum, Dharwad and Uttara Kannada regions (the ancient divisions of Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Banavasi-12,000) mention cattle raids, cowherds and shepherds. The numerous hero stones to those who fought in cattle raids was an indication of not only lawlessness but also of the importance of herding. The mention of the terms &quot;gosai&quot; (female &quot;goyiti&quot;), &quot;gosasa&quot;, &quot;gosasi&quot; and &quot;gosahasra&quot; in the adjective, the imposition of taxes on milk and milk products, the existence of large cattle herds and the gifting of a thousand cows as a mark of the donors affluence (&quot;gosahasram pradarum&quot;) indicate cow herding was an important part of the economy. There are records that mention the shepherd settlements (&quot;kuripatti&quot;), cowherd settlements (&quot;turpatti&quot;) and numerous references to small hamlets (&quot;palli&quot;).

Mixed farming, a combination of grazing and cultivation, mostly controlled by the wealthy Gavunda peasantry (today&#x27;s Gowdas), seems to be the thing to do, for both the quantum of grain produced and number of cattle head determined opulence. There are several records that mention the donation of both gracing and cultivable land in units of &quot;kolagas&quot; or &quot;khandugas&quot; to either those who fought cattle thieves or to their families. A nomadic way of life is not prevalent in most communities, with the exception of hill tribes called Bedas. A semi-nomadic community, according to Durrett, they frequently depended on cattle thieving from outlying farms and the abduction of women. The Bedas subsisted by selling to merchants stolen cattle and such produce from the forest as meat, sandalwood and timber, and crops from disorganized agriculture.

From inscriptions three types of land are evident; wet or cultivable land (&quot;nansey&quot;, &quot;bede&quot;, &quot;gadde&quot; or &quot;nir mannu&quot;) usually used to cultivate paddy (called &quot;akki gadde&quot;,&quot;akki galdege&quot; or &quot;bhatta mannu&quot;) or a tall stout grain yielding grass called &quot;sejje&quot;; dry land (&quot;punsey&quot;, rarely mentioned) and garden land (&quot;totta&quot;). A sixth-century grant refers to garden land that grew sugarcane (&quot;iksu&quot;). Other crops that were also cultivated were barley (&quot;yava&quot;), areca nut (&quot;kramuka&quot;), fallow millet (&quot;joladakey&quot;), wheat (&quot;godhuma&quot;), pulses (&quot;radaka&quot;), flowers were mostly for temple use and such lands called &quot;pundota&quot;, fruits such as plantains (&quot;kadali&quot;) and coconuts are also mentioned.

Village (&quot;palli&quot;) descriptions in lithic and copper plate records, such as the Hiresakuna 6th-century copper plates from Soraba, included its natural (or man made) bounding landmarks, layout of agricultural fields, repairs to existing and newly constructed water tanks, irrigation channels and streams, soil type and the crops grown. Repairs to tanks and construction of new ones was a preoccupation of elite, from kings to the &quot;Mahajanas&quot;, who claimed partial land ownership or a percentage of produce irrigated from the tank or both. Taxes were levied on newly irrigated lands, an indication the rulers actively encourage the conversion of dry land to cultivable wet land. An important distinction is made between types of landholdings: &quot;Brahmadeya&quot; (individual) and &quot;non-Brahmadeya&quot; (collective) and this is seen in inscriptions as early as the third-fourth century in South India. Records such as the Shikaripura Taluk inscription indicate occasionally women were village headmen and counselors, and held land (&quot;gavundi&quot;).

Functioning purely on the excess produce of the rural hinterland were the urban centers, the cities and towns (&quot;mahanagara&quot;, &quot;pura&quot;, and &quot;Polal&quot;) that often find mention in Kannada classics such as &quot;Vaddaradhane&quot; (c. 900) and &quot;Pampa Bharata&quot; (c. 940). References to townships with specialized classes of people such as the diamond and cloth merchants and their shops, merchant guilds (corporate bodies), important temples of worship and religious hubs, palaces of the royalty, vassals and merchants (&quot;setti&quot;), fortifications, courtesan streets, and grain merchants and their markets are a clear indication that these urban entities were the centers of administrative, religious and economic activity.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The end of the Satavahana rule in the third century coincided with the advent of two religious phenomena in the Deccan and South India: the spread of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. This was a direct result of the Gupta dynasties ardent patronage to Hinduism in northern India and their aversion to other religions. According to Sastri, till about the fifth century, South India witnessed a harmonious growth of these religions and the sects related to them without hindrance.

Appeasement of local deities and local practices which included offerings of sacrifices often went alongside popular Vedic gods such as Muruga, Shiva, Vishnu and Krishna. However, from the seventh century onward, the growing popularity of Jainism and Buddhism became a cause for concern to the Hindu saints who saw the growth of these new faiths as heretic to mainstream Hinduism. This new found Hindu resurgence, especially in Tamil country, was characterized by public debates and enthusiastic rebuttals by itinerant saints. Their main purpose was to energize and revive Hindu Bhakti among the masses and bring back followers of sects considered primitive, such as the Kalamukhas, Kapalikas and Pasupatas, into mainstream Hinduism.
The Kadambas were followers of Hinduism as evidenced by their inscriptions. The situation was the same with their immediate neighbors, the Gangas and the Pallavas. According to Adiga, their patronage to Brahmins well versed in the Vedas is all too evident. Inscriptions narrate various land grants to Brahmins that specify their lineage (&quot;gotra&quot;) as well as Vedic specialization. According to Sircar, the early rulers called themselves &quot;Brahmanya&quot; or &quot;Parama-brahmanya&quot;, an indication of their propensity toward Vaishnavism (a branch of Hinduism). The founding king Mayurasharma was, according to the Talagunda inscription, a Brahmin by birth though his successors may have assumed the surname&quot;Varma&quot; to indicate their change to Kshatriya (warrior) status. An inscription of Vishnuvarma describes him as the &quot;protector of the excellent Brahmana faith&quot;. His father Krishnavarma-I performed the Vedic &quot;ashvamedha&quot; (&quot;Horse sacrifice&quot;). There are numerous records that record grants made to Brahmins. According to Sircar, some fifth and sixth century inscriptions have an invocation of &quot;Hari-Hara-Hiranyagarbha&quot; and &quot;Hara-Narayana Brahman&quot; (Hari and Hara are another name of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Shiva).

The Talagunda inscription starts with an invocation of the Hindu god Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions start with an invocation of the god Vishnu. Madhukeshvara (a form of Shiva) was their family deity and numerous donations were made to the notable Madhukeshvara temple in Banavasi. Inscriptions mention various Shaiva sects (worshipers of the god Shiva) such as Goravas, Kapalikas, Pasupatas and Kalamukhas. Famous residential schools of learning existed in Balligavi and Talagunda. Vedic education was imparted in places of learning called &quot;Agrahara&quot; and &quot;Ghatika&quot;. However, they were tolerant to other faiths. The Kadamba kings appear to have encouraged Jainism as well. Some records of King Mrigeshavarma indicate describe donations to Jain temples and that King Ravivarma held a Jain scholar in high esteem. Names of such noted Jain preceptors as Pujyapada, Niravadya Pandita and Kumaradatta find mention in their inscriptions. Jainas occupied commanding posts of importance in their armies. According to Adiga, image worship, which was originally prohibited, was now popularized among the common man and the monks. This helped raise funds for the construction of Jain temples (&quot;Chaitya&quot;). Installation of images of Jain monks (&quot;Jaina&quot;) in temples and a steady move toward ritualistic worship among the laymen undermined the concept of &quot;quest for salvation&quot; and the ascetic vigor of the religion.

Grants were made to Buddhist centers as well. According to Kamath, the royal capital Banavasi had long been a place of Buddhist learning. In the seventh century, the Chinese embassy Xuanzang described Banavasi as a place of one hundred &quot;Sangharamas&quot; where ten thousand scholars of both the Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism lived. However, according to Ray, while there is evidence to prove that certain pre-Kadamba royal families, such as the Mauryas and Chutus may have patronized Buddhism, there is not much to say regarding the ruling Kadamba family, vast majority of whose inscriptions are Brahminical grants. In fact, according to Ray, the traces of Buddhist stupa sites that have been discovered in Banavasi are located outside the town.

===Society===
The caste system was prevalent in the organized Hindu society with the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas at the top. This had a deep impact on such socially important events as marriage. Even Jainism and Buddhism which initially found popularity by avoiding social hierarchy began to develop the trappings of a caste-based society. This particular feature was, according to Singh, a unique feature of Jainism in what is modern-day Karnataka during the early medieval period. Both the sects of Jainism, the Digambara and the Śvetāmbara followed a strict qualification process for persons worthy of initiation. Jinasena&#x27;s classic &quot;Adipurana&quot; counts purity of ancestry, physical health and soundness of mind as the main attributes that made a person worthy of such initiation. Both Jinasena and Ravisena (author of &quot;Padmapurana&quot;) discuss the existence of a &quot;varna&quot; (distinction or caste) based society and the responsibilities of each &quot;varna&quot;.

Majumdar notes that the Buddhist and Jain literature of the period accounts for the four &quot;varna&quot; by placing the Kshatriya above the Brahmin. While the Brahminical literature points to a tradition that permitted a Brahmin man to marry a woman of Kshatriya caste, a Brahmin woman was not allowed to marry a non-Brahmin man. Just the contrary seems to be the case with Buddhist and Jain literature which deema the marriage of a Brahmin man to Kshatriya woman as unacceptable but that of a Kshatriya man to a Brahmin woman as acceptable. Thus a caste system was in play with all the three main religions of the times. However, Majumdar does point out the highly assimilate nature of the Hindu society where all the early invaders into India, such as the Kushans, the Greeks, the Sakas and the Parthians were all absorbed into the Hindu society without a trace of their earlier practices.

A unique feature of medieval Indian society was the commemoration of the deceased hero by the erection of memorial stones (&quot;hero stone&quot;). These stones, the inscriptions and relief sculptures on them were meant to deify the fallen hero. According to Upendra Singh, The largest concentration of such stones, numbering about 2650 and dated to between the fifth and thirteenth centuries, are found in the modern Karnataka region of India. While most were dedicated to men, a few interesting ones are dedicated to women and pets. The Siddhenahalli, the Kembalu and the Shikaripura hero stones extol the qualities of women who died fighting cattle rustlers or enemies. The Gollarahatti and the Atakur inscription are in memory of a dog that died fighting wild boar, and the Tambur inscription of a Kadamba king of the Goa branch describes his death from sorrow of losing his pet parrot to a cat, and the Kuppatur stone was in memory of a bonded servant who was given the honorific &quot;slayer of the enemy&quot; (&quot;ripu-mari&quot;) for bravely fighting and killing a man-eater Tiger with his club before succumbing to his injuries.

According to Altekar, the practice of &quot;sati&quot; appears to have been adopted well after the Vedic period, because there was no sanction for the practice in the funeral hymns of the Rig Veda. According to him, even in the Atharva Veda, there is only a passing reference of widow being required to lie by the side of her husband&#x27;s corpse on the funeral pyre, then alight from it before it was lit, for the chanting of hymns to commence that blessed her with future wealth and children. This was an indication that window remarriage was in vogue. Altekar points out that even the authors of the &quot;Dharmasutras&quot; (400 BCE – )and the &quot;Smritis&quot; (), such as Manu and Yagnavalkya, do not make any mention of any ritual resembling &quot;sati&quot; in their description of the duties of women and widows in society, but rather prescribed the path of worldly renunciation as worthy. It is from about that the practice of &quot;sati&quot; begins to appear in the literature of Vatsyayana, Bhasa (&quot;Dutagatotkacha&quot; and &quot;Urubhanga&quot;), Kalidasa (&quot;Kumarasambhava&quot;) and Shudraka (&quot;Mirchchhakatika&quot;), with a real case in when deceased general Goparaja&#x27;s wife immolated herself on her husband&#x27;s pyre. Then around 606, the mother of King Harshavardhana decided to predecease her terminally ill husband.

This however did not find immediate support with noted poets such as Bana () and other tantra writers who considered &quot;sati&quot; inhuman and immoral. However around , the tide began to turn in northern India, especially in Kashmir, but found a later stronghold in Rajasthan. The belief in &quot;sati&quot; began to appeal, especially to the warrior classes, and the theory that performing &quot;sati&quot; cleansed the deceased husband of earthly sins and assured the couple a place in heaven caught on. Occasionally concubines, mothers, sisters, sisters-in-law and even ministers, servants and nurses joined in the act. This took its time to reach the Deccan (Kadamba territory) and the deep south (Tamil country) where the earliest cases, voluntary as they were, are seen by about . What was once a Kshatriya only practice came to be adopted by the Brahmins and even some Jains from around . In the modern Karnataka region (Kadamba territory), there are only eleven cases between and forty-one cases between , mostly in the warrior communities indicating an overall lack of appeal.

Physical education was very popular with men. The book &quot;Agnipurana&quot; encouraged men to avoid calisthenics with either partially digested food in their body or on a full stomach. Bathing with cold water after exercises was considered unhealthy. Medieval sculptures depict youth in physical combat training, doing gymnastics such as lifting the weight of the body with both hands, and doing muscular exercises such as bending a crowbar. The terms &quot;malla&quot; and &quot;jatti&quot; occur often in literature indicating wrestling was a popular sport with the royalty and the commoners. Wrestlers of both genders existed, the woman fighters meant purely for the entertainment to a male audience. Several kings had titles such as &quot;ahavamalla&quot; (&quot;warrior-wrestler&quot;), &quot;tribhuvanamalla&quot; (&quot;wrestler of the three worlds&quot;). The book &quot;Akhyanakamanikosa&quot; refers to two types of combative sports, the &quot;mushtiyuddha&quot; (&quot;fist-fight&quot;) and &quot;mallayuddha&quot; (or &quot;mallakalaga&quot;, &quot;wrestling fight&quot;). Wrestlers were distinguished based on their body weight, age, skill, proficiency and stamina. Those who exemplified themselves were recognized and maintained on specific diets.

Much of the information we get about activities such as archery and hunting is from classics such as the &quot;Agni Purana&quot; (post 7th century) and others. The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; says &quot;one who has made the vision of both of his mental and physical eyes steady can conquer even the god of death&quot;. An archers proficiency, which depended as much on his footwork as on his fingers and keen eyesight, was proven if he could hit bullseye by just looking down at the target&#x27;s reflection (&quot;Chhaya-Lakshya&quot; in &quot;Adipurana&quot; of , or &quot;Matsya-vedha&quot; in &quot;Manasollasa&quot; of ). Additional information is available in medieval sculptures which depict various archery scenes including one where a lady is taking aim from a chariot. Hunting was a favorite pass time of royalty in forest preserves. It served as entertainment, physical exercise and a test of endurance (&quot;mrigiyavinoda&quot; and &quot;mrigiyavilasa&quot;). The medieval sculptors spared no effort in depicting hunting scenes. The &quot;Manasollasa&quot; describes twenty one types of hunt including ambushing deer at waterholes with the hunting party dressed in green and concealed in the hollows of trees. It mentions a special breed of hunting dogs chosen from places such as the modern Jalandhar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha which were preferred for their stamina in chasing and cornering the prey. According to the &quot;Vikramankadevacharita&quot; queens and courtesans accompanied the king on horseback.

===Architecture===

According to Kamath, the Kadambas are the originators of the Karnataka architecture. According to Moraes their architectural style had a few things in common with the Pallava style. Kamath points out that their &quot;Vimana&quot; style (sanctum with its superstructure) is a Kadamba invention. A good example of this construction is seen in the Shankaradeva temple at Kadarolli in the modern Belgaum district. The structures themselves were simplistic with a square &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (sanctum) with an attached larger hall called &quot;mantapa&quot;. The superstructure (&quot;Shikhara&quot;) over the sanctum is pyramidal with horizontal non-decorative stepped stages tipped at the a pinnacle with a &quot;Kalasha&quot; (or &quot;Stupika&quot;).

The beginnings of Kadamba architecture can be traced to the fourth century based on evidence in the Talagunda pillar inscription of . The inscription makes mention of a Mahadeva temple of the Sthanagundur &quot;Agrahara&quot; which Adiga identifies with the protected monument, the Praneshvara temple at Talagunda. The Praneshvara temple bares inscriptions of Queen Prabhavati (of King Mrigeshavarma) from the late fifth century and of their son King Ravivarma. From these inscriptions, Adiga concludes the temple existed in the late fourth century. Further, according to Adiga, the pillar inscription supports the claim that the earliest structure existed there as early as the third century and was under the patronage of the Chutu Satakarnis of Banavasi.

Most of their extant constructions are seen in Halasi and surrounding areas with the oldest one ascribed to King Mrigeshavarma. Other notable temples in Halasi include the Hattikesavara temple with perforated screens by the doors, the Kallesvara temple with octagonal pillars, the Bhuvaraha Narasimha temple and the Ramesvara temple which shows a &quot;Sukhanasa&quot; projection (small tower) over the vestibule (&quot;Ardhamantapa&quot;) that connects the sanctum to the hall. All temples at Halasi have pillars with decorative capitals. The Kadamba style of tower was popular several centuries later and are seen in the Lakshmi Devi Temple at Doddagaddavalli (built by the Hoysalas in the 12th century) and the Hemakuta group of temples in Hampi built in the 14th century. In addition to temples, according to the art historian K.V. Soudara Rajan, the Kadambas created three rock-cut Vedic cave temples cut out of laterite at Arvalem in Goa. Like their temples, the caves too have an &quot;Ardhamantapa&quot; (&quot;half mantapa&quot;) with plain pillars and a sanctum which contain images of Surya (the sun god), Shiva and Skanda.

In later centuries, Kadamba architecture was influenced by the ornate architectural style of their overlords, the Kalyani Chalukyas (Later Chalukyas). The best representations of this style are seen in the Mahadeva temple at Tambdi Surla in modern Goa built with an open &quot;mantapa&quot; in the late 12th-13th century by the Kadambas of Goa; the single shrined (&quot;ekakuta&quot;) Tarakeshvara temple (modeled after the Mahadeva Temple, Itagi) built prior to with an open &quot;mantapa&quot; (and an ornate domical ceiling), a closed &quot;mantapa&quot;, a linked gateway and a Nandi &quot;mantapa&quot; (hall with the sculpture of the Nandi the bull); the Madhukeshwara temple at Banavasi which shows several Later Chalukyas style additions over a pre-existing Early Chalukya surroundings; and the 12th century, three shrined (&quot;Trikutachala&quot;) Kadambeshvara temple with open and closed &quot;mantapa&quot; at Rattihalli.
===Language===
According to the epigraphist D. C. Sircar, inscriptions have played a vital role in the re-construction of history of literature in India as well as the political history of the kingdoms during the early centuries of the first millennium. Some inscriptions mention names of noted contemporary and earlier poets (Aihole inscription of Ravikirti which mentions the Sanskrit poets Kalidasa and Bharavi). The development of versification and the &quot;Kavya&quot; style (&quot;epic&quot;) of poetry appears first in inscriptions before making their appearance in literature. Further some &quot;Kavya&quot; poets were the authors of inscriptions too (Trivikramabhatta composed the Bagumra copper plates and the Sanskrit classic &quot;Nalachampu&quot;). In the early centuries of the first millennium, inscriptions in the Deccan were predominantly in the Prakrit language. Then came a slow change with records appearing in bilingual Sanskrit-Prakrit languages around the middle of the fourth century, where the genealogy information is in Sanskrit while the functional portion was in Prakrit. From around the fifth century, Prakrit fell out of use entirely and was replaced by the Dravidian languages. In the Kannada speaking regions in particular, the trend was to inscribe in Sanskrit entirely or in Sanskrit-Kannada.

The credit of the development of Kannada as a language of inscriptions between the fourth and sixth centuries goes to the Kadambas, the Gangas and the Badami Chalukyas. Among the early ones are the Halmidi stone inscription and the Tagare copper plates which are ascribed to the Kadambas. While the main content of the inscriptions were in Sanskrit, the boundary specifications of the land grant were in Kannada. In subsequent two centuries, not only do inscriptions become more numerous and longer in size, these inscriptions show a significant increase in the usage of Kannada, though the invocatory, the implicatory and the panegyric verses are in Sanskrit. Settar points out that there are inscriptions where the implicatory verses have been translated verbatim into Kannada also. In fact Kannada composed in verse meters start making their appearance in inscriptions even before being committed to literature.

Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main sources of the Kadamba history. The Talagunda, Gudnapur, Birur, Shimoga, Muttur, Hebbatta, Chandravalli, Halasi and Halmidi inscription are some of the important inscriptions that throw light on this ancient ruling family of Karnataka. Inscriptions of the Kadambas in Sanskrit and Kannada ascribed to Kadamba branches have been published by epigraphists Sircar, Desai, Gai and Rao of the Archaeological Survey of India. The Kadambas minted coins, some of which have Kannada legends which provide additional numismatic evidence of their history. The Kadambas (along with their contemporary Ganga dynasty of Talakad) were the first rulers to use Kannada as an additional official administrative language, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription of . The historian Kamath claims Kannada was the common language of the region during this time. While most of their inscriptions are in Sanskrit, three important Kannada inscriptions from the rule of the early Kadambas of Banavasi have been discovered.

Recent reports claim that the discovery of a 5th-century Kadamba copper coin in Banavasi with Kannada script inscription &quot;Srimanaragi&quot; indicating that a mint may have existed in Banavsi that produced coins with Kannada legends at that time. The discovery of the Talagunda Lion balustrade inscription at the Praneshvara temple during excavations in 2013, and its publication by the ASI in 2016, has shed more light on the politics of language during the early Kadamba era. The bilingual inscription dated to 370 CE written in Sanskrit and Kannada is now thought to be the oldest inscription in the Kannada language.

==In modern times==
&quot;Kadambotsava&quot; (&quot;The festival of Kadamba&quot;) is a festival that is celebrated every year by the Government of Karnataka in honor of this kingdom. The creation of the first native Kannada kingdom is celebrated by a popular Kannada film, &quot;Mayura&quot; starring Raj Kumar. It is based on a popular novel written in 1933 with the same name by Devudu Narasimha Sastri. On 31 May 2005 Defence minister of India Pranab Mukherjee commissioned India&#x27;s most advanced and first dedicated military naval base named INS Kadamba in Karwar.

The Indian state government of Goa owned bus service is named after the Kadambas Dynasty and is known as Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTCL).The royal lion emblem of the Kadambas is used a logo on its buses. The lion emblem logo became an integral part of KTCL since its inception in 1980 when the corporation was set up to provide better public transport service.

<doc id="1140393" wikidata="Q5380048" url="?curid=1140393" title="Ensoniq MR61">
<text>The Ensoniq MR61 is a 61-key music workstation synthesizer that Ensoniq released in 1996. It features a 16-track sequencer, digital effects, and several hundred onboard sounds or patches.

This music workstation got rid of some previous classical Ensoniq features, such as polyphonic after-touch (replacing it with a mono version) and full sound editability. Its concept of usage was also radically different from previous Ensoniq keyboards, such as the TS-10. The machine&#x27;s operating system was created with numerous operational and MIDI software bugs. An updated OS chip that resolved these issues was created and is still available from third-party vendors. Most problems were compensated for by an improved 64-note polyphony, high quality 24-bit effects and a quick (but not fully editable) sequencer. The addition of the Idea Pad, which was essentially a MIDI capture buffer, allowed the user to quickly move anything recently played on the MIDI keyboard, including pitch-bend, mod, and MIDI real-time controllers to a track in the sequencer.

While the direct sample loading facilities of the previous TS/ASR models were lost, a rare add-on card, called the MR-Flash, allowed the MR/ZR keyboards to load up to 4 mebibytes of samples into permanent flash ROM, via floppy disk drive. However, no sample library import facilities were offered, so existing ASR/TS owners couldn&#x27;t use their sample files on the new machine. A drum machine with pro-quality mixable preset patterns, benefited from the unusually large internal drum sounds library (approx. 700 samples) and was integrated with the sequencer, but it was impossible to create patterns inside the machine. Instead, a program that allowed a user to create drum patterns on PC was developed, thus allowing the user to create numerous rhythms that could be loaded onto disk and work within the fluid drum machine and all aspects of the keyboard.

The effects section runs at full 44.1 kHz quality, unlike the TS engine at 32 kHz. The routing scheme was also simplified from previous machines and sports similarities with Roland&#x27;s XP machines.

All MR versions could house up to three expansion cards, each one holding up to 24 megabytes of samples and sound data. That was a first for Ensoniq products. Three are known: Perfect Piano, Urban Dance Project and World Sounds. Each cost about $250. A fourth card, the Drums Expansion, could give the rack version a feature that was a standard part of the keyboard versions. It was a 2 mebibyte add-on and contained about 700 drum sounds. A fifth card was the aforementioned flash expansion.

The MR76 was the 76-note weighted keyboard version. The MR-Rack (which actually appeared before the keyboard versions) shared the same architecture and sounds, with the obvious exception of the sequencer and drum machine. Also, while the rack version could take the same wave expansion cards of the keyboard counterparts, it was not compatible with the flash ROM sample-loading add-on.

You can hear some Ensoniq MR-Sounds on the Janet Jackson Song Together Again and her album The Velvet Rope from 1997.

<text>Shrine Catholic Schools is a private, co-educational Catholic school serving preschool through grade 12. It is located in Royal Oak, Michigan,and affiliated with National Shrine of the Little Flower.

The school consists of Shrine Catholic Grade School on one campus and Shrine Catholic Academy (middle school) and Shrine Catholic High School on another campus.

The school was founded as Little Flower High School, an all-girls school, in the late 1930s. The all-boys school, Shrine High School, was added later, and the schools were eventually merged.

==History==
Father Charles Coughlin helped establish the institution while serving as one of the first Roman Catholic priests to preach to a widespread audience over the medium of radio during the Great Depression. His program became increasingly controversial as World War II approached, bringing national attention to the parish. The Bishop asked Fr. Coughlin to give up his radio show, which he did. The school maintained the name &quot;Shrine of the Little Flower High School&quot; into the 1960s, when it became &quot;Shrine High School&quot; until its latest name change in 2001.

==Academy &amp; High School Campus==
Shrine&#x27;s 6th through 12th grade campus is located on 20 acres in Royal Oak, Michigan. Features of the school include a chapel, learning resource center, an academic and college counseling center, three science labs, a two-story visual arts lab, football field, 2 fitness centers, and a student center dining hall. A new field house and the new Sanders Auditorium are the result of a renovation on the schools campus. Current technology is found throughout the school. The school has recently renovated classrooms to help support the addition of 6th grade students into the academy.

==Athletics==
Shrine participates in the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) and is a member of the Catholic High School League (CHSL) in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. The school has placed 17 athletes into the CHSL Hall of Fame.

Shrine&#x27;s sports include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, golf, cross-country, football, men&#x27;s hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s softball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s skiing, and women&#x27;s tennis.

<text>Blue Thunder is a 1983 American action thriller film directed by John Badham.

The Blue Thunder helicopter itself did exist as two copies of modified French Aérospatiale Gazelles.

A spin-off television series, also called &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, ran for 11 episodes in 1984.

==Plot==
Frank Murphy is a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) air support division pilot and troubled Vietnam War veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. His newly assigned observer is novice Richard Lymangood. The two patrol the city at night and give assistance to police forces on the ground when needed.

Upon returning from patrol, the pair are placed under a two-week suspension for allegations of voyeurism during a nearby mugging incident gone wrong that leads to the shooting death of city councilwoman Diana McNeely. Murphy is shortly reinstated for duty and is instructed to attend a private sunrise demonstration in the Mojave Desert at &quot;Pinkville&quot; and is selected to pilot an advanced helicopter, informally called &quot;&quot;The Special&quot; &quot; but given the nickname &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, during an evaluation exercise. It is a military-style combat aircraft intended for police use in surveillance and against possible large-scale civic disobedience or terrorism during the 1984 Summer Olympics.

With robust bulletproof armor, powerful armament, and other accoutrements, such as thermal infrared scanners, unidirectional microphones and cameras, built-in mobile telephone, computer and modem, a six-barreled 20 millimeter electric cannon, a &quot;whisper mode&quot; that lets the aircraft fly silently and a U-matic video cassette recorder; &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; appears to be a formidable tool in the war on crime. Murphy notes wryly that with enough of these helicopters &quot;you could run the whole damn country.&quot;

When McNeely&#x27;s death is seemingly turning out to be more than just a random murder, Murphy begins his own covert investigation. He discovers that a subversive action group is intending to use &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; in a military role to quell urban disorder under the project codename T.H.O.R. (&quot;Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response&quot;), and are secretly eliminating political opponents to advance their agenda, which McNeely was looking into at the time.

Murphy suspects the involvement of his old Vietnam nemesis, former United States Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane, the primary test pilot for &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; and someone who felt Murphy was &quot;unsuitable&quot; for the program. During a test flight operation over the city, Murphy and Lymangood use &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; to follow and video record a meeting between Cochrane and the other government officials which would implicate them in the conspiracy, but Cochrane unexpectedly looks outside and sees &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; hovering in front of their window and realize what has happened.

After landing, Lymangood secures the tape and hides it, but is captured upon returning to his home, interrogated, and then killed while trying to escape from them. Murphy hijacks &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; and arranges to have his girlfriend Kate retrieve the tape and deliver it to the local news station, using the helicopter to thwart her pursuers. After a crazy high-speed journey through the city which wrecks many police and civilian vehicles, Kate arrives at the news station, but is almost confronted by one of the conspirators; the reporter Kate was sent to find intercepts Kate and gets the tape back, while the conspirator is knocked unconscious by a security guard before it can be electronically erased.

Deeming Murphy as a security risk, Cochrane and the other conspirators employ every asset they can manage to bring &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; down, including the initial support of the municipal government; beginning with two LAPD Bell 206s. After Murphy incapacitates the first one, forcing it to land via autorotation, he engages in a cat-and-mouse chase with the second by slaloming down the Los Angeles River viaduct until his pursuer crashes. Following this, two Air National Guard F-16 fighters are deployed to deal with Murphy, but he manages to shoot one of them down and evade the other. In the process, one heat-seeking missile destroys a barbecue stand in Little Tokyo and a second missile hits the sun-warmed windows of an ARCO Plaza high-rise building, in both cases having been fooled into missing the prototype by the heat generated by the false targets. Appalled at the heavy destruction in the city so far, and wanting to avoid further collateral damage, the mayor then suspends the hunt-and-destroy operation.

Cochrane, frustrated and bent on finally putting down his former subordinate, defies his orders to stand down and ambushes &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; in a heavily-armed Hughes 500 helicopter. After a tense battle, Murphy shoots Cochrane down, executing a 360° loop through use of &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; turbine boost function. His vehicle having sustained heavy damage and running low on fuel, Murphy then destroys &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; by landing it in front of an approaching freight train; the helicopter erupts in a huge fireball, but Murphy quietly walks away unharmed and disappears, his enemies assuming he was killed in the explosion.

In the meantime, the tape is made public, and the conspirators are arrested.

==Production==
Co-writers Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Don Jakoby began developing the plot while living together in a Hollywood apartment in the late 1970s, where low-flying police helicopters woke them on a regular basis. Their original script was a more political one, attacking the concept of a police state controlling the population through high-tech surveillance and heavy armament. They sought and received extensive script help from Captain Bob Woods, then-chief of the LAPD&#x27;s Air Support Division. The first draft of the screenplay for &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; was written in 1979 and featured Frank Murphy as more of a crazy main character with deeper psychological issues, who went on a rampage and destroyed much of Los Angeles before finally falling to F-16s.

The script was rewritten by American screenwriter Dean Riesner with directions on the style of dialogue from director John Badham.

Filmed on location in Los Angeles beginning in the late months of 1981, &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; was one of Warren Oates&#x27; last films before his death on April 3, 1982, which occurred during post-production, and the film is dedicated to him. He made one movie and one TV episode before and after filming during 1981–1982 that were released after &quot;Blue Thunder.&quot;

Although the film was shot in Los Angeles and real-life neighborhoods are mentioned, the LAPD did not allow any references to be made to them. Hence, the police force is known as the more-generic &quot;Metropolitan Police&quot; and Frank Murphy is part of the fictional &quot;ASTRO Division&quot;, rather than the real-life &quot;Air Support Division&quot;. However, Air Support assignments are often known as ASTRO, or &quot;Air Support to Regular Operations&quot;.

The LAPD Hooper Heliport, which was still under construction at the time, filled in as the home base for the fictional version of the police air unit. The drive-in theater scene where Frank&#x27;s girlfriend Kate recovers the tape was filmed at the Pickwick Theatre in Burbank, California; the theater has since then been demolished and replaced by a Pavilions supermarket.

Malcolm McDowell, who portrayed antagonist F. E. Cochrane; ironically has an intense fear of flying in real life and not even his then-wife Mary Steenburgen could persuade him to overcome his phobia. In an interview for &quot;Starlog&quot; in 1983, Badham recalled, &quot;He was terrified. He used to get out and throw up after a flight.&quot; McDowell&#x27;s grimaces and discomfort can be seen during the climactic battle between Murphy and Cochrane in the film. Steenburgen commented to filmmakers afterward, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how you got him up there, I can&#x27;t even get him in a 747!&quot;

===Blue Thunder helicopter===

Designer Mickey Michaels created the helicopters used in the film after reviewing and rejecting various existing designs. The helicopters used for &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; were French built Aérospatiale SA-341G Gazelles modified with bolt-on parts and Apache-style canopies. Two modified Gazelle helicopters, a Hughes 500 helicopter, and two radio-controlled F-16 fighter models were used in the filming of the movie. The helicopters were purchased from Aérospatiale by Columbia Pictures for $190,000 each and flown to Cinema Air in Carlsbad, California where they were heavily modified for the film. These alterations made the helicopters so heavy that various tricks had to be employed to make it look fast and agile in the film. For instance, the 360° loop maneuver Murphy performs at the end of the film, which catches Cochrane so completely by surprise that he is easily shot down by Murphy&#x27;s gunfire and killed, was carried out by a radio controlled model.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Blue Thunder&quot; was released on May 13, 1983. It was the number 1 ranked film in the United States on its opening weekend, taking in $8,258,149 at 1,539 theaters, overtaking the previous number 1 film &quot;Flashdance&quot;. The film was ranked No. 2 in its second and third weekends. Overall, in the US, it earned $42,313,354 over its 66 days of release. &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; was released in West Germany on February 5, 1983, before its US release, and it was released worldwide between June and September 1983. Its UK release was August 25, 1983. It was released in East Germany and South Korea in 1984. Its total international box office income is unreported. The film earned $21.9 million from video rentals in the US.

===Critical response===
 On Metacritic it has a score of 66% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a ripsnorting live-action cartoon, utterly implausible but no less enjoyable for that&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Blue Thunder&quot; hovers just this side of trash and the other side of credibility, but it propels a willing audience into adrenaline heaven.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The action sequences are what the film is all about, and these are remarkably well done, including a climactic, largely bloodless shootout among helicopters and jet fighters over Los Angeles.&quot;

C. J. Henderson reviewed &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 63. Henderson commented that &quot;&quot;Blue Thunder&quot; is this year&#x27;s must-see action film. See it.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #14 and commented that &quot;For those who want a film that is both filled with action &quot;and&quot; thought provoking, &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; is a sure bet. Watch out, George, the Jedi have competition.&quot;

The film garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Film Editing for Frank Morriss and Edward Abroms, but lost out to &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

==Cultural references==
An acronym used in the film, &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Just Another Fucking Observer&quot;, is police community and is mentioned repeatedly in the film in reference to any police helicopter&#x27;s non-pilot second officer, in this case Daniel Stern&#x27;s character of Richard Lymangood. In the related TV series, the reference is expurgated for prime-time television as &quot;Just Another &quot;Frustrated&quot; Observer&quot; for Clinton Wonderlove (Dana Carvey).

A screen still from &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; of the helicopter flying in front of the Los Angeles skyline is used as the background image of the title screen in the Sega 1987 video game &quot;Thunder Blade&quot;.

In the &quot;TaleSpin&quot; episode &quot;Baloo Thunder,&quot; the episode title and certain plot elements are referenced and parodied from the film, when ace pilot Baloo helps out his inventor friend Buzz, who is being framed for stealing a &quot;Top Secret Project&quot; from his industrialist employer Shere Khan by an ambitious corporate spy within Khan Industries for a rival competitor, which in reality is the new invention for its time period: the helicopter.

In the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player can infiltrate a military base and steal an attack helicopter to perform vigilante missions known as &quot;Brown Thunder&quot;, spoofing the film.

==Video game==
In 1987, Coca-Cola Telecommunications released a &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; video tape cartridge for Worlds of Wonder&#x27;s short lived Action Max game system. Using footage from the film, the player plays the pilot of the Blue Thunder helicopter as he tries to prevent the World Peace Coalition from being attacked by a terrorist organization.

==Remake==
In 2015, Sony proposed a remake of &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; focusing on drone technology, with Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca as producers, and Craig Kyle as writer. In 2017, it was announced that Columbia Pictures would be overseeing the remake.

<doc id="1140407" wikidata="Q670579" url="?curid=1140407" title="The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)">
<text>The Incredible Hulk is an American television series based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. The series aired on the CBS television network and starred Bill Bixby as Dr. David Banner, Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk, and Jack Colvin as Jack McGee.

In the series, Dr. David Banner, a widowed physician and scientist who is presumed dead, travels across the United States under assumed names and finds himself in positions where he helps others in need despite his terrible secret: Following an accident that altered his cells, in times of extreme anger or stress, he transforms into a huge, savage, incredibly strong green-skinned humanoid, who has been named the Hulk. In his travels, Banner earns money by working temporary jobs while searching for a way to either control or cure his condition. All the while, he is obsessively pursued by a tabloid newspaper reporter, Jack McGee, who is convinced that the Hulk is a deadly menace whose exposure would enhance his career.

The series two-hour television pilot movie, which established the Hulk&#x27;s origins, aired on November 4, 1977. The series 80 episodes were originally broadcast by CBS over five seasons from 1978 to 1982. It was developed and produced by Kenneth Johnson, who also wrote or directed some episodes. The series ends with David Banner continuing to search for a cure.

In 1988, the filming rights were purchased from MCA/Universal by New World Television for a series of TV movies to conclude the series&#x27; storyline. The broadcast rights were, in turn, transferred to rival NBC. New World (which at one point owned Marvel) produced three television films: &quot;The Incredible Hulk Returns&quot; (directed by Nicholas J. Corea), &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot;, and &quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (both directed by Bill Bixby). Since its debut, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; has garnered a worldwide fan base.

==Premise==
David Banner, M.D., is a physician and scientist employed at California&#x27;s Culver Institute, who is traumatized by the car accident that killed his beloved wife, Laura. Haunted by his inability to save her, Banner and his research partner, Dr. Elaina Marks, study people who were able to summon superhuman strength during moments of extreme stress. Obsessed with discovering why he was unable to exhibit such super-strength under similar conditions, Banner hypothesizes that high levels of gamma radiation from sunspots contributed to the subjects&#x27; increase in strength. Impatient to test his theory, Banner conducts an unsupervised experiment in the laboratory, bombarding himself with gamma radiation. However, the radiology equipment has recently been recalibrated, and Banner unknowingly receives a massive overdose. He initially thinks that the experiment has failed, but, when he injures himself while changing a flat tire, Banner&#x27;s anger triggers his transformation into a , green skinned, superhumanly strong creature who is driven by rage, and has only a primitive intelligence. The creature reverts to Banner when he calms down, and, since Banner is unable to remember what occurs while in his transformed state, he goes to Marks for help. The two of them slowly piece together what happened and investigate the nature of the metamorphosis, and the possibility of a cure. Their efforts are hindered by tabloid reporter Jack McGee, who was initially investigating Banner and Marks&#x27; superhuman strength research but now suspects them of being connected to the reports of a green-skinned monster roaming the area. While snooping around their laboratory, McGee unknowingly triggers a fire, and Banner rushes back into the laboratory to save Marks, only for the creature to emerge from the fire with her in his arms, dying. Mistakenly believing that Banner was killed in the fire along with Marks and that the creature was responsible for their deaths, McGee publishes a story naming the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; as their killer and urges law enforcement to capture him. Believed to be dead, Banner grimly resolves to travel from place to place, assuming different identities and odd jobs to support himself and enable his search for a cure. He also finds himself feeling obliged to help the people he meets out of whatever troubles have befallen them. Inevitably, doing so puts him in perilous situations that trigger his transformations into the Hulk, which in turn attracts the attention of McGee, who is obsessively pursuing the mysterious creature across the country, both to prevent further violence and to bring legitimacy to his story.

Despite the rampages, the Hulk usually does good for the people Banner encounters in his travels. Each episode inevitably ends with Banner back on the road, fearful that the Hulk&#x27;s appearances will bring unwanted scrutiny from the authorities and the ever-persistent McGee.

Prior to the beginning of the series, a different version (also provided by Cassidy) was used for the second pilot movie, &quot;The Return of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (later re-titled &quot;Death in the Family&quot;):

==Production==

===Development===
In early 1977, Frank Price, head of Universal Television (known today as NBCUniversal Television), offered producer and writer Kenneth Johnson a deal to develop a television show based on any of several characters they had licensed from the Marvel Comics library. Johnson turned down the offer at first, but then, while reading the Victor Hugo novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, he became inspired and decided to add elements from the novel, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and the idea of Greek tragic hubris, and then began working to develop the Hulk comic into a TV show.

Johnson made several changes from the comic book; this was partly to translate it into a live-action show that was more believable and acceptable to a wide audience, and also because he disliked comics and thus felt it best that the show be as different from the source material as possible. In the character&#x27;s origin story, rather than being exposed to gamma rays during a botched atomic testing explosion, Banner is gamma-irradiated in a more low-key laboratory mishap during a test on himself. Another change was Banner&#x27;s occupation, from physicist to medical researcher/physician. Although the comic book Hulk&#x27;s degree of speaking ability has varied over the years, the television Hulk did not speak at all—he merely growled and roared. Hulk co-creator Stan Lee later recounted: &quot;When we started the television show, Ken said to me, &#x27;You know, Stan, I don&#x27;t think the Hulk should talk&#x27;. The minute he said it, I knew he was right. [In the comics], I had the Hulk talking like this: &#x27;Hulk crush! Hulk get him!&#x27; I could get away with it in a comic, but that would have sounded so silly if he spoke that way in a television show&quot;. Because red is the color of rage, Johnson also wanted Hulk to be red instead of green, but had to give up on that one and use Hulk&#x27;s color from the comics.

The Hulk&#x27;s strength is far more limited than in the comic book, which Johnson felt was necessary for the show to be taken seriously by viewers. The Hulk still retained a healing factor, however. For instance, in &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;, Banner is in a serious accident that severs his spinal cord, leaving him paraplegic, but after his next transformation into the Hulk he is able to walk within minutes while in that form, and Banner&#x27;s spine is completely restored by the end of the episode. In the majority of episodes, the only science-fiction element was the Hulk himself. Johnson also omitted the comic book&#x27;s supporting characters, instead using original character Jack McGee.

Johnson changed the name of the Hulk&#x27;s comic book alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner, to Dr. David Banner for the television series. This change was made, according to Johnson, because he did not want the series to be perceived as a comic book series, so he wanted to change what he felt was a staple of comic books, and Stan Lee&#x27;s comics in particular, that major characters frequently had alliterative names. According to both Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, it was also changed because CBS thought the name Bruce sounded &quot;too gay-ish&quot;, a rationale that Ferrigno thought was &quot;the most absurd, ridiculous thing [he had] ever heard&quot;. On the DVD commentary of the pilot, Johnson says that it was a way to honor his son David. &quot;Bruce&quot; ultimately became the television Banner&#x27;s middle name, as it had been in the comics. It is visible on Banner&#x27;s tombstone at the end of the pilot movie, and that footage is shown at the beginning of every episode of the series.

In an interview with Kenneth Johnson on the Season 2 DVD, he explains that he had also wanted the Hulk to be colored red rather than green. His reasons given for this were that red, not green, is perceived as the color of rage, and also that red is a &quot;human color&quot;, whereas green is not. However, Stan Lee, an executive at Marvel Comics at the time, said that the Hulk&#x27;s color was not something that could be changed, because of its iconic image.

Stan Lee told Kenneth Plume in a June 26, 2000, interview: &quot;&quot;The Hulk&quot; was done intelligently. It was done by Ken Johnson, who&#x27;s a brilliant writer/producer/director, and he made it an intelligent, adult show that kids could enjoy. He took a comic book character and made him somewhat plausible. Women liked it and men liked it and teenagers liked it... It was beautifully done. He changed it quite a bit from the comic book, but every change he made, made sense&quot;.

===Casting===
For the role of Dr. David Banner, Kenneth Johnson cast Bill Bixby—his first choice for the role. Jack Colvin was cast as &quot;Jack McGee&quot;, the cynical tabloid newspaper reporter—modeled after the character of Javert in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;—who pursues the Hulk. Arnold Schwarzenegger auditioned for the role of the Hulk, but was rejected due to his inadequate height, according to Johnson in his commentary on &quot;The Incredible Hulk – Original Television Premiere&quot; DVD release. Actor Richard Kiel was hired for the role. During filming, however, Kenneth Johnson&#x27;s son pointed out that Kiel&#x27;s underdeveloped physique did not resemble the Hulk&#x27;s. Soon, Kiel was replaced with professional bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, although a very brief shot of Kiel (as the Hulk) remains in the pilot. According to an interview with Kiel, who saw properly out of only one eye, he reacted badly to the contact lenses used for the role, and also found the green makeup difficult to remove, so he did not mind losing the part.

The opening narration was provided by actor Ted Cassidy, who also provided the Hulk&#x27;s voice-overs (mainly growls and roars) during the first two seasons. Cassidy died during the production of season two in January 1979. The Hulk&#x27;s vocalizations for the remainder of the series were provided by actor Charles Napier, who also made two guest-starring appearances in the series.

====Guest stars and cameos====
During the series&#x27; five-season run, many actors familiar to viewers, or who later became famous for their subsequent works, made appearances on the series, including: future &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot; co-star Susan Sullivan in the original pilot; Brett Cullen, also of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;; Kim Cattrall, of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; fame; Ray Walston, co-star of Bixby&#x27;s first series, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;; Brandon Cruz, co-star of &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;; Lou Ferrigno, who along with starring as the Hulk, appeared in one episode (&quot;King of the Beach&quot;) as a different character; Bixby&#x27;s ex-wife Brenda Benet; and in an uncredited role, the bodybuilder and professional wrestler Ric Drasin as the half-transformed Hulk in &quot;Prometheus&quot; (parts 1 and 2).

Mariette Hartley won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her guest appearances as Dr. Carolyn Fields in the episode &quot;Married&quot; (aka &quot;Bride of the Incredible Hulk&quot;) in season two.

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the writer and artist team who created the Hulk for Marvel Comics, both made cameo appearances in the series. Kirby&#x27;s cameo was in the season two episode &quot;No Escape&quot;, while Lee appeared as a juror in &quot;Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (the 1989 post-series TV movie).

===Make-up===
Initially, the Hulk&#x27;s facial make-up was quite monstrous, but after both pilots, the first two weekly episodes and New York location shooting for the fourth, the design was toned down. The makeup process used to transform Ferrigno into the Hulk took three hours. The hard contact lenses Ferrigno wore to simulate the Hulk&#x27;s electric-green eyes had to be removed every 15 minutes because he found wearing them physically painful. The green fright wig he wore as the Hulk was made of dyed yak hair.

===Music===
Joe Harnell, one of Kenneth Johnson&#x27;s favorite composers, composed the music for &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. He was brought into the production because of his involvement with the series &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, which Johnson had also created and produced. Some of the series&#x27; music was collected into an album titled &quot;The Incredible Hulk: Original Soundtrack Recording&quot;. 
The show&#x27;s main theme, &quot;The Lonely Man&quot;, is heard in two distinct arrangements, the opening credits features the piece in an up-tempo, percussive arrangement whilst a sad, melancholic solo-piano version is played over the closing credits, which usually shows Banner hitchhiking. down a lonely highway.

The show&#x27;s secondary theme, &quot;The Love Theme from The Incredible Hulk&quot;, was used extensively in both the pilot episode and in the Season 2 opener &quot;Married&quot;, and it made sporadic appearances throughout the show&#x27;s run.

==Themes==
Often, Banner&#x27;s inner struggle is paralleled by the dilemmas of the people he encounters, who find in Dr. Banner a sympathetic helper. Producer Kenneth Johnson stated: &quot;What we were constantly doing was looking for thematic ways to touch the various ways that the Hulk sort of manifested itself in everyone. In Dr. David Banner, it happened to be anger. In someone else, it might be obsession, or it might be fear, or it might be jealousy or alcoholism! The Hulk comes in many shapes and sizes. That&#x27;s what we tried to delve into in the individual episodes&quot;.

===Syndication===
The series first went into syndication in September 1982. It has aired as reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel and was one of the series that the channel showed at its inception in September 1992. It has also aired on Retro Television Network, and ran on Esquire Network from 2014 to 2015. Series reruns began airing on most MeTV affiliates in February 2016. The series began airing on most H&amp;I affiliates in May 2017. El Rey Network started airing the series in portrait-form in January 2017.

===Made-for-TV movies===
Two episodes of the series appeared first as stand-alone television movies, but these were later re-edited into one-hour length (two-parters) for syndication. They were produced as pilots before the series officially began in 1978:
*&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1977) (distributed in theaters in some countries)
*&quot;The Return of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (1977) (also shown overseas as a feature film); retitled &quot;Death in the Family&quot; for syndication

After the cancellation of the television series in 1982, Bill Bixby retained an interest in producing new adventures featuring the Hulk for television. In 1984, just two years after the cancellation of the weekly series, he made a proposal to Nicholas Hammond, who had played Peter Parker in the 1977–79 TV series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, to develop a new TV movie featuring both the Hulk and Spider-Man. Although nothing came of this idea, three television movies were eventually produced with Bixby and Ferrigno reprising their roles. All of these aired on NBC:
*&quot;The Incredible Hulk Returns&quot; (1988) – This marked the first time that another Marvel Universe character appeared in the milieu of the TV series. David Banner meets a former student (played by Steve Levitt) who has a magical hammer that summons Thor (played by Eric Allan Kramer), a Norse god who is prevented from entering Valhalla. It was set up as a backdoor pilot for a live-action television series starring Thor. This project marked Jack Colvin&#x27;s final appearance as McGee.
*&quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (1989) – David Banner meets a blind lawyer named Matt Murdock and his masked alter ego, Daredevil. The Incredible Hulk and the Daredevil battle Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin of Crime). Daredevil was portrayed by Rex Smith, and John Rhys-Davies portrayed Fisk. This was also set up as a backdoor pilot for a live-action television series featuring Daredevil. Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as one of the jury members overlooking Banner&#x27;s trial.
*&quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot; (1990) – David Banner falls in love with an Eastern European spy (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and saves two kidnapped scientists. The film ends with the Hulk taking a fatal fall from an airplane, reverting to human form just before he dies.

Despite the apparent death of the Hulk in the 1990 film, another Hulk television movie was planned, &quot;Revenge of the Incredible Hulk&quot;. It was rumored that in this film the Hulk would be able to talk after being revived with Banner&#x27;s mind, and that it was abandoned because of Bill Bixby&#x27;s death from cancer in November 1993. However, Gerald Di Pego (writer/executive producer of &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot;, and &quot;Revenge of the Incredible Hulk&quot;) revealed that the film was canceled before Bixby&#x27;s health began to decline, owing to disappointing ratings for &quot;Death of&quot;, and that Banner was to have been revived without the ability to change into the Hulk at all, reverting to (still non-speaking) Hulk form only in the film&#x27;s final act.

==Home media==
Universal released all 5 seasons on DVD in Region 1 from 2006 to 2008; a complete series DVD set was also released.

Fabulous Films released &quot;The Incredible Hulk - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in the UK on September 30, 2008. They subsequently released the complete series (not including the three post-series TV movies) on Blu-ray in December 2016.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the two-hour pilot has a score of 57% based on seven reviews, for an average rating of 5.4/10, while the first season has a rating of 75% based on eight reviews, for an average rating of 6.0/10. Writing for the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot;, Steve Watkins noted that Lou Ferrigno &quot;did the strong, silent type like nobody&#x27;s business&quot;, and was &quot;natural&quot; in the titular role.

A retrospective on the TV series reported that the episodes that fans of the show most often cited as the best of the series are &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (pilot), &quot;Married&quot;, &quot;Mystery Man&quot;, &quot;Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The Snare&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, &quot;The First&quot; and &quot;Bring Me the Head of the Hulk&quot;.

===Ratings===

* 1977–1978: #26 (tied with &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;)
* 1978–1979: #44 (tied with &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Dear Detective&quot;)
* 1979–1980: #42 
* 1980–1981: #49 
* 1981–1982: #34

&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was a solid ratings performer, usually winning its Friday night time slot, and even became a hit in Europe, despite superheroes generally being much less popular there than in the United States.

==Other media==
The series led to a syndicated newspaper strip that ran from 1978 to 1982. It used the same background and origin story as the series but narrated stories outside of it.

Power Records (Peter Pan records) created an LP in 1978 entitled &quot;The Incredible Hulk: Hear Four Exciting All New Action Adventure Stories! – Black Chasm, Monster From The Deep, The Assassin &amp; Blind Alley&quot;. In the stories he is referred to as &quot;David Banner&quot; and is also a name–changing drifter seeking a cure.

In 1979, Ideal Toy Company released a board game called: The Incredible Hulk – Smash–Up Action Game. In the game you have to try &amp; create a lab in order to find a cure for &#x27;Dr. David Banner&#x27;, again referencing the series.

In 1979, a Hulk &quot;video novel&quot; in paperback form was released, with pictures and dialog from the pilot.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has homaged the show twice. The first time, during the opening credits of the film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), Bruce Banner&#x27;s (Edward Norton) experiment which serves as his origin story as the Hulk is shown as the same as in the television series. The show&#x27;s opening sequence is homaged in the Disney+ series &quot;She-Hulk: Attorney at Law&quot; (2022) during the episode &quot;Whose Show Is This?&quot;. It is recreated to focus on Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk (Tatiana Maslany), with Banner (Mark Ruffalo) also appearing, dressed as David. Stan Lee created She-Hulk to ensure CBS did not create a female Hulk first and acquire the rights to the concept.

<text>Charles Van Dell Johnson (August 25, 1916  – December 12, 2008) was an American actor and dancer. He had a prolific career in film, television, theatre and radio, which spanned over 50 years, from 1940 to 1992. He was a major star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during and after World War II, known for his upbeat and &quot;all-American&quot; screen persona, often playing young military servicemen, or in musicals.

Originally a Broadway dancer, Johnson achieved his breakthrough playing a rookie bomber pilot in &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; (1943). Throughout the war years, he became a popular Hollywood star, as the embodiment of the &quot;boy-next-door wholesomeness&quot; playing &quot;the red-haired, freckle-faced soldier, sailor, or bomber pilot who used to live down the street&quot; in such films as &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (also 1943) and &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944). After World War II, he continued to play similar heartthrob and military characters, equal parts in serious dramas like &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954), and in light musicals like &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954).

After the end of his contract with MGM, he transitioned largely into television, though he continued to make regular film appearances in featured and supporting parts, earning an Emmy Award nomination for his performance in the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;. He continued to maintain a regular presence in musical theatre, most notably as Professor Harold Hill in the West End productions of &quot;The Music Man&quot; and Georges in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, before retiring from acting in the early 1990s. At the time of his death in 2008, he was one of the last surviving matinee idols of Golden Age of Hollywood.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Newport, Rhode Island, the only child of Loretta (née Snyder) and Charles E. Johnson, a plumber and later a real-estate salesman. His father was born in Sweden and came to the United States as a child, and his mother had Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother was allegedly an alcoholic who left the family when he was a child, and he was not close to his father.

==Career==

Johnson performed at social clubs in Newport while in high school. He moved to New York City after graduation in 1935 and joined the off-Broadway revue &quot;Entre Nous&quot;.

===Broadway===
Johnson toured New England in a theater troupe as a substitute dancer, but his acting career began in earnest in the Broadway revue &quot;New Faces of 1936&quot;. He returned to the chorus after that and worked in summer resorts near New York City. In 1939, director and playwright George Abbott cast him in Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; in the role of a college boy and as understudy for all three male leads. He had an uncredited role in the film adaptation of &quot;Too Many Girls&quot;, which costarred Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, then Abbott hired him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly&#x27;s understudy in &quot;Pal Joey&quot;.

===Warner Bros.===
Johnson was about to move back to New York when Lucille Ball took him to Chasen&#x27;s Restaurant, where she introduced him to MGM casting director Billy Grady who was sitting at the next table. This led to screen tests by Hollywood studios. His test at Columbia Pictures was unsuccessful, but Warner Brothers put him on contract at $300 a week. He was cast as a cub reporter opposite Faye Emerson in the 1942 film &quot;Murder in the Big House&quot;. His eyebrows and hair were dyed black for the role. Johnson&#x27;s all-American good looks and easy demeanor were ill-suited to the gritty movies that Warner made at the time, and the studio dropped him at the expiration of his six-month contract.

===MGM===
Johnson was soon signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The studio provided him with classes in acting, speech, and diction. He then had an uncredited part as a soldier in &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot; (1942). He attracted attention in a small part in &quot;The War Against Mrs. Hadley&quot; (1942), and this encouraged MGM to cast him in their long-running series Dr. Kildare. These films had starred Lew Ayres as Dr. Kildare and Lionel Barrymore as Dr. Gillespie; Ayres&#x27; career was hurt due to being a conscientious objector, so the series focused on Dr. Gillespie mentoring new doctors. Johnson played Dr. Randall Adams in &quot;Dr. Gillespie&#x27;s New Assistant&quot; (1942).

MGM then cast Johnson as Mickey Rooney&#x27;s soldier brother in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943), a huge hit. He returned as Randall Adams in &quot;Dr. Gillespie&#x27;s Criminal Case&quot; (1943) and was in uniform again for &quot;Pilot No. 5&quot; (1943). He had a small role as a reporter in &quot;Madame Curie&quot; (1943).

===&quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; and stardom===
Johnson&#x27;s big break was in &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; starring Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne, in which he played a young pilot who acquires a deceased pilot as his guardian angel. During the film&#x27;s production in 1943, Johnson was involved in a serious car accident that left him with a metal plate in his forehead and a number of scars on his face that plastic surgery could not completely correct or conceal. Johnson also underwent brain surgery. He recovered at the home of Keenan Wynn before returning to acting. He wore heavy makeup to hide the scars for the rest of his career. MGM wanted to replace him in &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, but Tracy insisted that he be allowed to finish the picture, despite his long absence. The film was a great hit, earning a profit of over one million dollars and launching Johnson as a star.

Johnson&#x27;s injuries from the car accident exempted him from service in World War II. Many other actors were serving in the armed forces, so the accident greatly benefited Johnson&#x27;s career. He later said, &quot;There were five of us. There was Jimmy Craig, Bob Young, Bobby Walker, Peter Lawford, and myself. All tested for the same part &quot;all&quot; the time.&quot; Johnson was very busy, often playing soldiers; he joked of this period, &quot;I remember... finishing one Thursday morning with June Allyson and starting a new one Thursday afternoon with Esther Williams. I didn&#x27;t know which branch of the service I was in!&quot;

MGM built up Johnson&#x27;s image as the all-American boy in war dramas and musicals. His first top-billed role in an &quot;A&quot; picture was the musical &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; (1944) which was a big success; it was his first film with June Allyson. He had a smaller part in &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1944), then reprised his role as Dr. Adams in &quot;3 Men in White&quot; (1944).
===Post-war career peak===
Johnson played Ted Lawson in &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944) which told the story of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in April 1942. He played Dr. Adams one last time in &quot;Between Two Women&quot; (1945). He starred in &quot;Thrill of a Romance&quot; (1945), a musical with Esther Williams, and &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot; (1945), a musical remake of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; with Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon, and Ginger Rogers. In 1945, he tied with Bing Crosby as the top box office stars.

He was reunited with Williams in &quot;Easy to Wed&quot; (1946), a musical remake of &quot;Libeled Lady&quot;. He supported Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in &quot;State of the Union&quot; (1948), and he supported Clark Gable and Pidgeon in the war drama &quot;Command Decision&quot; (1948).
===MGM under Dore Schary===
20th Century Fox borrowed Johnson to make the comedy &quot;Mother Is a Freshman&quot; (1948) with Loretta Young. Back at MGM, he was given a role in the film noir &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; (1949). In 1949, he starred with Judy Garland in &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot;, which also marked the first film appearance of Liza Minnelli as Garland&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s young daughter. He next worked in &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949), a movie about the Battle of the Bulge produced by MGM&#x27;s new studio head Dore Schary.
Johnson made the comedy &quot;The Big Hangover&quot; (1950), then was reunited with Williams in &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot; (1951). He appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot; (1951). He played an officer leading Japanese-American troops of the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe in the Schary-produced film &quot;Go for Broke!&quot; (1951). He had a small part in &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Country&quot; (1951) and was reunited with Allyson for &quot;Too Young to Kiss&quot; (1951). MGM lent him to Columbia for &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954) in the role of Stephen Maryk. He refused to allow concealment of his facial scars when being made up as Maryk, believing that they enhanced the character&#x27;s authenticity. Herman Wouk describes Maryk as having &quot;ugly but not unpleasant features&quot; in the novel. One commentator noted years later that &quot;Humphrey Bogart and Jose Ferrer chomp up all the scenery in this maritime courtroom drama, but it&#x27;s Johnson&#x27;s character, the painfully ambivalent, not-too-bright Lieutenant Steve Maryk, who binds the whole movie together.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine commented that Johnson &quot;was a better actor than Hollywood usually allowed him to be.&quot;

Johnson next teamed with Gene Kelly as the sardonic second lead of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954). He had the lead in &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (1954), his last film for MGM. He had a five-year contract with Columbia to make one film a year.

Unlike some other stars of that era, Johnson did not resent the restrictions of the studio system. In 1985, he said that his years at MGM were &quot;one big happy family and a little kingdom&quot;. &quot;Everything was provided for us, from singing lessons to barbells. All we had to do was inhale, exhale and be charming. I used to dread leaving the studio to go out into the real world, because to me the studio was the real world.&quot;

===Freelancer===
During the 1950s, Johnson continued to appear in films and also appeared frequently in television guest appearances. He appeared as the celebrity mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; airing on November 22, 1953, but was not questioned by the panel due to advance notice of his appearance. He then appeared again on the May 22, 1955, airing and was guessed by Fred Allen. He was in &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1955) at Columbia then made &quot;The Bottom of the Bottle&quot; (1956) at Fox. He received favorable critical notices for the 1956 dramatic film &quot;Miracle in the Rain&quot;, co-starring Jane Wyman, in which he played a good-hearted young soldier preparing to go to war, and in the mystery &quot;23 Paces to Baker Street&quot;, in which he played a blind playwright residing in London. He returned to MGM for &quot;Slander&quot; (1956) and &quot;Action of the Tiger&quot; (1957).

Johnson appeared as the title character of the highly rated &quot;spectacular,&quot; &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, a musical version of Robert Browning&#x27;s poem, set to the music of Edvard Grieg. Featuring Claude Rains in his only singing and dancing role, it aired on November 26, 1957, as part of NBC&#x27;s week of Thanksgiving specials. The program was so successful it spawned a record album and was repeated in 1958. Syndicated to many local stations, it was rerun annually for many years in the tradition of other holiday specials.

On February 19, 1959, Johnson appeared in the episode &quot;Deadfall&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot; in the role of Frank Gilette, a former outlaw falsely charged with bank robbery. He is framed by Hugh Perry, a corrupt prosecutor played by Harry Townes, and Deputy Stover, portrayed by Bing Russell. Convicted of the robbery, Gilette is captured by outlaws while on his way to prison, and the sheriff, Roy Lamont, portrayed by Grant Withers, is killed.

In 1959, Johnson turned down an opportunity to star as Eliot Ness in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, which went on to become a successful television series with Robert Stack as Ness.

Johnson guest-starred as Joe Robertson, with June Allyson and Don Rickles, in the 1960 episode &quot;The Women Who&quot; of the CBS anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. In 1961 Johnson traveled to England to star in Harold Fielding&#x27;s production of &quot;The Music Man&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre in London. The show enjoyed a successful run of almost a year, with Johnson playing the arduous leading role of Harold Hill to great acclaim.
In 1968 he was in the successful MGM film &quot;&quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968 film)&quot; along with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.

Johnson also guest-starred on &quot;Batman&quot; as &quot;The Minstrel&quot; in two episodes (39 and 40) in 1966. In the 1970s, he appeared on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. He played a lead character in the 1976 miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, and was nominated for a prime time Emmy Award for that role. In the 1980s, he appeared on an episode of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; along with June Allyson. He also appeared in a special two-part episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Musical: My Ex-Mom; The Show Must Go On; The Pest, Parts 1 and 2&quot; which aired on February 27, 1982, and co-starred Ann Miller, Ethel Merman, Della Reese, Carol Channing, and Cab Calloway.

In the 1970s, after twice fighting bouts of cancer, Johnson began a second career in summer stock and dinner theater. In 1985, returning to Broadway for the first time since &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, he was cast in the starring role of the musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;. In that same year he appeared in a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot;. At the age of 75, now grey and rotund, he toured in &quot;Show Boat&quot; as Captain Andy. His last film appearance was in &quot;Three Days to a Kill&quot; (1992). In 2003, he appeared with Betsy Palmer for three performances of A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot; at a theater in Wesley Hills, New York.

==Personal life==
Johnson married former stage actress Eve Abbott (1914–2004) on January 25, 1947, the day after her divorce was finalized from actor Keenan Wynn. Their daughter Schuyler was born in 1948. By this marriage, Johnson gained stepsons Edmond Keenan (Ned) and screenwriter Tracy Keenan Wynn. In a statement by Eve, published after her death at age 90, she said MGM had engineered her marriage to Johnson to cover up his alleged homosexuality. &quot;They needed their &#x27;big star&#x27; to be married to quell rumors about his sexual preferences and unfortunately, I was &#x27;It&#x27;the only woman he would marry.&quot; Commenting on their complicated relationships, Keenan Wynn&#x27;s father Ed Wynn said, &quot;I can&#x27;t keep them straight. Evie loved Keenan. Keenan loves Evie. Van loves Evie. Evie loves Van. Van loves Keenan. Keenan loves Van.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s biographer Ronald L. Davis writes that it &quot;seems to have been well known in the film capital&quot; that Johnson had homosexual tendencies, but this was never reported or hinted at by newspaper columnists or movie magazine writers during the era when Johnson made movies. Studio executive Louis B. Mayer made strenuous efforts to quash any potential scandal regarding Johnson and any of his actor-friends whom Mayer suspected of being homosexual. Johnson&#x27;s marriage to Eve Abbott ended four years after Mayer&#x27;s death when Johnson, performing as Professor Harold Hill in &quot;The Music Man&quot; in the West End in London, is alleged to have begun an affair with a male dancer in the production, according to her son Ned Wynn. He claimed that Johnson left her &quot;for a mana boy, really. He&#x27;s the lead boy dancer.&quot; The couple separated in 1961 and their divorce was finalized in 1968.

In contrast to his &quot;cheery Van&quot; screen image, Eve claimed that he was morose and moody because of his difficult early life. She reported that he had little tolerance for unpleasantness and would stride into his bedroom and seclude himself at the slightest hint of trouble. He had a difficult relationship with his father growing up, and he was estranged from his daughter at the time of his death.

==Later years and death==

Johnson retired from acting in the early 1990s and lived in a penthouse at 405 East 54th Street on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side. He moved to Tappan Zee Manor, an assisted living facility in Nyack, New York. He died there on December 12, 2008, at age 92. His remains were cremated.

==Legacy==
Johnson was never nominated for an Academy Award and, during the height of his career, was noted mainly for his cheerful screen presence. Reflecting on his career after his death, one critic observed that Johnson was &quot;capable of an Oscar-worthy performance, and that&#x27;s more than most movie stars can claim&quot;. For his contribution to the film industry, Johnson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6600 Hollywood Blvd.

<doc id="1140411" wikidata="Q3085570" url="?curid=1140411" title="Nightbird (Erasure album)">
<text>Nightbird is the eleventh studio album by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released by Mute Records on 24 January 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 25 January 2005 in the United States.

==History==
&quot;Nightbird&quot; received mixed reviews and was only a moderate commercial success, charting no higher than number 27 in UK. Despite the mixed critical reception, many longtime fans of the band hailed it as a return to the sound and feel of classic Erasure albums like &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Chorus&quot;. Singer Andy Bell&#x27;s revelation that he was HIV-positive just prior to the album&#x27;s release shed new meaning on the songs&#x27; introspective and sometimes melancholy lyrics.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Breathe&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number four – Erasure&#x27;s highest peak since &quot;Always&quot; hit number four in 1994. No singles from the album charted on the U.S. &quot;Breathe&quot; became Erasure&#x27;s second number-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart – their first being &quot;Victim of Love&quot; in 1987.

A massive concert tour accompanied this album which travelled across Europe and the UK as well as North America. The tour, dubbed &quot;The Erasure Show&quot;, featured the extravagant set designs and costume changes Erasure is known for. The tour wrapped up in June 2005.

The album graphic artwork was made by the British artist Rob Ryan.

&quot;Nightbird&quot; was Erasure&#x27;s first studio album not to be issued on vinyl; none of the three singles were released commercially on vinyl, although promotional remix 12&quot;s exist. A vinyl version was finally released in 2016 for the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Nightbird&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 53 based on 14 reviews.

In a review for AllMusic, critic reviewer David Jeffries wrote: &quot;Bell&#x27;s dealings with HIV have obviously influenced &quot;Nightbird&quot;, but he rarely points right to it, making the album adaptable to any listener&#x27;s own introspection. Smart, moving, approachable, and well constructed, &quot;Nightbird&quot; is Erasure&#x27;s mature masterpiece.&quot; Christian Hoard from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained: &quot;&quot;Nightbird&quot; is full of elegant dance pop topped by the choirboy-like Bell singing about love, heartache and dreams. One could easily mistake &quot;Nightbird&quot; for something the duo made in the Eighties.&quot;

== Track listing ==
===2016 &quot;Erasure 30&quot; 30th anniversary BMG reissue LP===
Subsequent to their acquisition of Erasure&#x27;s back catalog, and in anticipation of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, BMG commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007&#x27;s &quot;Light at the End of the World&quot;. All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gram vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.

This marked the first release of this album on vinyl.

<doc id="1140419" wikidata="Q4863054" url="?curid=1140419" title="Baroque pearl">
<text>Baroque pearls are pearls with an irregular, non-spherical shape. Shapes can range from minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinched, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical nucleation bead.

Nowadays, most jewelry stores selling baroque pearl jewelry offer cultured freshwater pearls rather than wild freshwater pearls, which are significantly more expensive. Cultured freshwater pearls are affordable and lend themselves well to various pearl jewelry designs. Pearl jewelry stores may bleach or dye freshwater cultured pearls after harvesting to enhance their color. 

The most valuable baroque pearls are the South Sea and the Tahitian pearls, which are produced by &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot; (black-lipped oysters) and &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; (gold-lipped and silver-lipped oysters). 
Western Australia is currently the world&#x27;s largest cultivator of pearls from &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; oysters, whereas Tahiti is the number one cultivator of pearls from &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot; oysters.

Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the thickness of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls.

==Career==

===College===
Carrieri was born in San Antonio, Texas. After a successful high school career at North Stafford High School in Stafford, Virginia, Carrieri played college soccer at the University of North Carolina, where he was hugely successful. In his rookie year, he scored 13 goals and 3 assists, and was named the ACC Rookie of the Year. He did just as well his second year, finishing with 12 goals and 5 assists, and was named a third team NCAA All-American. In his junior season, he led the nation by scoring 25 goals, and added an astonishing 14 assists, and was named an NCAA first-team All-American. He also played club soccer for the Prince William Cardinals.

===Professional===
In 2000, Carrieri played two games, scoring three goals, with the New Brunswick Brigade in the Premier Development League. Following his junior season, Carrieri signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. He was drafted first overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the San Jose Earthquakes, and immediately vowed to lead the team to a championship. Although the Earthquakes won the MLS Cup that year, Carrieri was not there to see it - shortly into the season he was traded to the Colorado Rapids for Junior Agogo. Carrieri had a relatively impressive rookie campaign with the Rapids, registering 5 goals and 4 assists in only 14 games with the team. In his second year with the team, Carrieri established his reputation as a quality American forward in scoring 12 goals and 5 assists for the Rapids, including a remarkable 2nd half hat trick on July 4 (the second in club history) in front of 61,213 fans at Invesco Field at Mile High. In his third year, Carrieri&#x27;s production slowed, partially because of a contested (and temporary) move to right midfield, and he finished the year with 3 goals and 8 assists. Following the season, Carrieri was not re-signed by the Rapids, apparently partially because of conflicts with the coach Tim Hankinson, and partially because of salary cap concerns.

Carrieri signed before the 2004 season with the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the A-League. He had a solid season with the team, finishing the year with 8 goals and 8 assists in 27 games. After the end of the season, he played one game with the Chicago Fire, after being called up as an injury replacement. Carrieri also briefly played indoor for the Chicago Storm of the MISL. In 2005, with coach Tim Hankinson no longer at the helm, the Rapids brought back Carrieri for tryouts, but did not offer him a contract after pre-season. He then signed with Richmond Kickers of the then A-League. In 2006, Richmond went down to USL-2. Still under contract with the Kickers, Carrieri stayed with the newly demoted club and helped lead them to the 2006 USL Second Division Championship, where he scored the championship winning goal for the Kickers. In 2007, he became one of the first players to sign with the expansion USL First Division club Carolina RailHawks. He played in twenty-eight games, most as a starter, before announcing his retirement from professional soccer on March 18, 2008.

After spending 2008 coaching with the Capital Area Soccer League in Raleigh, North Carolina, Carrieri was coaxed out of retirement in 2009 by the Richmond Kickers, and he subsequently played 5 games and scored 1 goal for the team on the way to winning the 2009 USL2 championship. On January 14, 2010, Richmond announced the re-signing of Carrieri for the 2010 season.

<doc id="1140443" wikidata="Q3029022" url="?curid=1140443" title="Cultured pearl">
<text>Cultured pearls are pearls which are formed within a cultured pearl sac with human intervention in the interior of productive living molluscs in a variety of conditions depending upon the mollusc and the goals. Having the same material as natural pearls, cultured pearls can be cultivated in seawater or freshwater bodies. Over 95% of the pearls available on the market are cultured pearls.

== Development of a pearl ==

A pearl is formed when the mantle tissue is injured by a parasite, an attack of a fish, or another event that damages the external fragile rim of the shell of a mollusk shell bivalve or gastropod. In response, the mantle tissue of the mollusk secretes nacre into the pearl sac, a cyst that forms during the healing process. Chemically speaking, this is calcium carbonate and a fibrous protein called conchiolin. As the nacre builds up in layers of minute aragonite tablets, it fills the growing pearl sac and eventually forms a pearl.

Natural pearls are initiated in nature more or less by chance, but cultured pearls are human-initiated, formed by inserting a tissue graft from a donor mollusk, upon which a pearl sac forms, and the inner side precipitates calcium carbonate, in the form of nacre or &quot;mother-of-pearl&quot;. 

The most popular and effective method for creating cultured pearls utilizes the shells of freshwater river mussels harvested in the Midwestern U.S., from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Shells with the common names &quot;Washboard&quot;, &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, &quot;Ebony&quot;, &quot;Pimpleback&quot;, and &quot;Three Ridge&quot; are popular for use in pearl culture due to their compatibility with the host animal and the nacre they are to be covered by. These high-quality and sought-after shells are first sliced into strips and then into cubes. The edges and corners are ground down until they are a roughly spherical and then milled to become perfectly round, and brought to a highly polished finish.
== Pearl nuclei: the core of modern cultured pearls ==

A pearl nucleus or a bead for cultured pearl is a sphere (usually) or other shape (occasionally) formed only by cutting and polishing a nacreous shell used to accommodate the nacre secreted from a graft of mantle tissue, that eventually forms the centre of a beaded cultured pearl. While the material can be of anything that does not negatively affect the health of a pearl oyster, the modern age pearl cultivators normally use freshwater bivalves that either come from the US Mississippi River or China&#x27;s freshwater bodies located in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces.

===Nucleation===

The cultured pearls on the market today can be divided into two categories. The first category covers the beaded cultured pearls, including Akoya, South Sea, Tahiti, and the large, modern freshwater pearl, the Edison pearl. These pearls are gonad-grown, and usually one pearl is grown at a time. This limits the number of pearls at a harvest period. The pearls are usually harvested after one year for &quot;akoya&quot;, 2–4 years for Tahitian and South Sea, and 2–7 years for Edison. This perliculture process was first developed by British biologist William Saville-Kent, who passed the information along to Tatsuhei Mise and Tokichi Nishikawa from Japan.

The second category includes the non-beaded freshwater cultured pearls, like the Biwa or Chinese pearls. As they grow in the mantle, where on each wing up to 25 grafts can be implanted, these pearls are much more frequent and saturate the market completely. An impressive improvement in quality has taken place in the last 10 years, when the formerly rice grain-shaped pebbles are compared with the near round pearls of today. In the last two years, large, near perfectly round, bead-nucleated pearls up to 15 mm in diameter with metallic luster have been produced.

The nucleus bead in a beaded cultured pearl is generally a polished sphere made from freshwater mussel shell. Along with a small piece of mantle tissue from another mollusk (donor shell) to serve as a catalyst for the pearl sac, it is surgically implanted into the gonad (reproductive organ) of a saltwater mollusk. In freshwater perliculture, only the piece of tissue is used in most cases, and is inserted into the fleshy mantle of the host bivalve. South Sea and Tahitian pearl oysters, as &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; and &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot;, respectively, which survive the subsequent surgery to remove the finished pearl, are often implanted with a new, larger bead as part of the same procedure, and then returned to the water for another 2–3 years of growth. An experimental process using a radio-frequency identification nucleus allows the provenance of cultured pearls to be tracked.

==History==

=== Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD) ===

One of the first recorded histories of cultured pearls was found in the ancient China during the Song Dynasty. The cultivation method was the same as the Mabe-pearl (half pearl) that we know of today. Instead of using the shells or saibo as the core, they used a mold to create a buddhist figure made from lead. The mold was then inserted into the freshwater mussel shell, &quot;Hyriopsis cumingii&quot;.

=== Reaching Europe ===
In 1637, Mr. Song Yingxing compiled a Chinese encyclopedia called Tiangong Kaiwu (天工開物). Chapter 18 of this collection mentioned about the pearls and the formation theory. Along the line of history and with the help of the Silk Road, Tiangong Kaiwu arrived in Europe and was translated. Scientists who were fascinated by the mysteries of pearls began their quest to find out how pearls are formed.

=== Formation Theories and Cultivation Research ===
From the 16th to the 18th century, the western world advanced in pearl research as new technologies, such as microscopes, developed. Scientists began more sophisticated research on pearl formation, developing new theories one after another. &quot;Disease Causation Theory (Guillaume Rondeletius, 1507 - 1566), Egg Causation Theory (Chauveton, 1578), Sand Grain Causation Theory (Sir R. Redding, 1674), Parasite Causation Theory (D. E. von Baer, 1830),&quot; and the &quot;Pearl Sac Theory&quot; &quot;(William Saville Kent, 1893)&quot; were all theories that tried to explain the pearls&#x27; formation. 

=== The Rise of the Modern Cultured Pearl Industry ===
Mikimoto Kōkichi was able to use Nishikawa&#x27;s technology. After the patent was granted in 1916, the technology was immediately commercially applied to&quot; akoya&quot; pearl oysters in Japan in 1916. Mise&#x27;s brother was the first to produce a commercial crop of pearls in the &quot;akoya&quot; oyster. Mitsubishi&#x27;s Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the South Sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton and Palau. Mitsubishi was the first to produce a cultured South Sea pearl – although the first small commercial crop of pearls was not successfully produced until 1928.

The original Japanese cultured pearls, known as &quot;akoya &quot;pearls, are produced by a species of small pearl oyster, &quot;Pinctada fucata&quot;, which is no bigger than 6 to 8 cm in size, hence &quot;akoya&quot; pearls larger than 10 mm in diameter are extremely rare and highly priced. Today, a hybrid mollusk is used in both Japan and China in the production of &quot;akoya&quot; pearls. Furthermore, other &quot;Pinctada&quot; and &quot;Pteria&quot; species are also used for producing cultured pearls today.

===Modern industry===

The development of cultured pearls took much of the chance, risk, and guesswork out of the pearl industry, allowing it to become stable and predictable, and fostering its rapid growth over the past 100 years. Today, more than 99% of all pearls sold worldwide are cultured pearls. Colored pearls, which occur due to local chemicals inside the shell, much in the way of rubies or sapphires, can be made by inserting colored minerals into the mussel shell, e.g., cobalt chloride to create a pinkish color.

Cultured pearls can often be distinguished from natural pearls through the use of X-rays, which reveals the inner nucleus of the pearl.

<doc id="1140452" wikidata="Q1877476" url="?curid=1140452" title="Pulmonary agent">
<text>A pulmonary agent, or choking agent, is a chemical weapon agent designed to impede a victim&#x27;s ability to breathe. Such compounds operate by causing a build-up of fluids in the lungs, which then leads to asphyxiation. Exposure of the eyes and skin tends to be corrosive, causing blurred vision and severe deep burns. Inhalation of these agents causes burning of the throat, coughing, vomiting, headache, pain in chest, tightness in chest, and respiratory and circulatory failure.

Examples of pulmonary agents include:
*Chlorine gas
*Chloropicrin (PS)
*Diphosgene (DP)
*Phosgene (CG)
*Disulfur decafluoride
*Perfluoroisobutene
*Acrolein
*Diphenylcyanoarsine

Phosgene is the most dangerous commonly used pulmonary agent (although disulfur decafluoride and perfluoroisobutene are both even more dangerous, with respectively 4 and 10 times the lethality of phosgene, neither is widely used). It is a colorless gas under ordinary conditions. It has a vapor density 3.4 times greater than that of air, allowing it to remain low in the air for long periods of times. Phosgene leads to massive pulmonary edema, which reaches maximum symptoms in 12 hours after exposure, followed by death within 24 to 48 hours.

Chlorine is an element used in industry. It is one of the most commonly manufactured chemicals in the United States. It is used to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents. It is also used in drinking water and swimming pools to kill bacteria. The extent of poisoning chlorine causes depends on the amount of chlorine to which a person is exposed.

== History ==
The first major use of these agents came on April 22, 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium. The Germans opened up 168 tons of chlorine gas on the French, Canadian and British troops which created a wind-borne cloud of chemical gas that opened up a breach in the lines. However, the Germans were not prepared to exploit the opening. In 1917 the Germans also introduced the agent phosgene. By then both sides had mastered the techniques of new choking agents such as diphosgene, chloropicrin, and perfluoroisobutene which allowed numerous attacks to be made. By the end of World War I, phosgene was responsible for roughly 80% of all deaths related to chemical attacks.

<text>Tremella fuciformis is a species of fungus; it produces white, frond-like, gelatinous basidiocarps (fruiting bodies). It is widespread, especially in the tropics, where it can be found on the dead branches of broadleaf trees. This fungus is commercially cultivated and is one of the most popular fungi in the cuisine and medicine of China. &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is commonly known as snow fungus, snow ear, silver ear fungus, white jelly mushroom, and white cloud ears.

&quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is a parasitic yeast, and grows as a slimy, mucus-like film until it encounters its preferred hosts, various species of &quot;Annulohypoxylon&quot; (or possibly &quot;Hypoxylon&quot;) fungi, whereupon it then invades, triggering the aggressive mycelial growth required to form the fruiting bodies.

==Description==
Fruit bodies are gelatinous, watery white, up to across (larger in cultivated specimens), and composed of thin but erect, seaweed-like, branching fronds, often crisped at the edges. Microscopically, the hyphae are clamped and occur in a dense gelatinous matrix. Haustorial cells arise on the hyphae, producing filaments that attach to and penetrate the hyphae of the host. The basidia are tremelloid (ellipsoid, with oblique to vertical septa), 10–13 μm × 6.5–10 μm, sometimes stalked. The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, 5–8 μm × 4–6 μm, and germinate by hyphal tube or by yeast cells.

===Similar species===

&quot;Ductifera pululahuana&quot; is more opaque, as is &quot;Sebacina sparassoidea&quot;, which grows on the ground. 

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; was first described in 1856 by English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley, based on collections made in Brazil by botanist and explorer Richard Spruce. In 1939, Japanese mycologist Yosio Kobayasi described &quot;Nakaiomyces nipponicus&quot;, a similar-looking fungus that differed by having scattered, dark spines on its surface. Later research, however, showed that the fruit bodies were those of &quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; parasitized by an ascomycete, &quot;Ceratocystis epigloeum&quot;, that formed the dark spines. &quot;Nakaiomyces nipponicus&quot; is therefore a synonym of &quot;T. fuciformis&quot;.

In Mandarin Chinese, it is called (pinyin: &quot;yín ěr&quot;; literally &quot;silver ear&quot;), (pinyin: xuě ěr; literally &quot;snow ear&quot;); or (pinyin: &quot;bái mù ěr&quot;, literally &quot;white wood ear&quot;), and in Japanese it is called &quot;shiro kikurage&quot; (, lit. &quot;white tree jellyfish&quot;). In Vietnam, it is called &quot;nấm tuyết&quot; or &quot;ngân nhĩ&quot;.

According to Paul Stamets, common names for &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; include: white jelly mushroom, yin er, white jelly fungus, white jelly leaf (&quot;shirokikurage&quot;), silver ear mushroom, snow mushroom, and chrysanthemum mushroom.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; is known to be a parasite of &quot;Hypoxylon&quot; species. Many of these species were reassigned to a new genus, &quot;Annulohypoxylon&quot;, in 2005 including its preferred host, &quot;Annulohypoxylon archeri&quot;, the species routinely used in commercial cultivation. Following its host, fruit bodies are typically found on dead, attached or recently fallen branches of broadleaf trees.

The species is mainly tropical and subtropical, but extends into temperate areas in Asia and North America. It is known throughout South and Central America, the Caribbean, parts of North America, sub-Saharan Africa, southern and eastern Asia, Australia, New Zealand (although this may be an NZ indigenous species), and the Pacific Islands.

==Uses==

&quot;Tremella fuciformis&quot; has been cultivated in China since at least the nineteenth century. Initially, suitable wooden poles were prepared and then treated in various ways in the hope that they would be colonized by the fungus. This haphazard method of cultivation was improved when poles were inoculated with spores or mycelium. Modern production only began, however, with the realization that both the &quot;Tremella&quot; and its host species needed to be inoculated into the substrate to ensure success. The &quot;dual culture&quot; method, now used commercially, employs a sawdust mix inoculated with both fungal species and kept under optimal conditions. The most popular species to pair with &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is its preferred host, &quot;Annulohypoxylon archeri&quot;. Estimated production in China in 1997 was 130,000 tonnes. &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is also cultivated in other East Asian countries, with some limited cultivation elsewhere.

In Chinese cuisine, &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is traditionally used in sweet dishes. While tasteless, it is valued for its gelatinous texture as well as its supposed medicinal benefits. Most commonly, it is used to make a dessert soup called &quot;luk mei&quot; () in Cantonese, often in combination with jujubes, dried longans, and other ingredients. It is also used as a component of a drink and as an ice cream. Since cultivation has made it less expensive, it is now additionally used in some savoury dishes.
In Vietnamese cuisine, it is often used in Chè (Vietnamese pronunciation: [cɛ̂]), a Vietnamese term that refers to any traditional Vietnamese sweet beverage, dessert soup or pudding.

=== Cosmetics ===
&quot;T. fuciformis&quot; extract is used in women&#x27;s beauty products from China, Korea, and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines. Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of superoxide dismutase in the brain and liver; it is an enzyme that acts as a potent antioxidant throughout the body, particularly in the skin. It can also be used for anti-inflammatory purposes. The medical benefits that come from this organism are vast, ranging from boosting immune health to lowering heart disease. &quot;T. fuciformis&quot; is also known in Chinese medicine for nourishing the lungs.

<doc id="1140472" wikidata="Q1622967" url="?curid=1140472" title="Boot Hill">
<text>Boot Hill, or Boothill, is the generic name of many cemeteries, chiefly in the Western United States. During the 19th and early 20th century it was a common name for the burial grounds for paupers.

== Origin of term ==
Although many towns use the name &quot;Boot Hill&quot;, the first graveyard named &quot;Boot Hill&quot; was at Hays, Kansas, five years before the founding of Dodge City, Kansas. The meaning of why cemeteries were called &quot;Boot Hills&quot; has been lost, but there are three plausible reasons.

The first possible meaning of the term is based on poverty and alludes to the fact that many of the cemeteries&#x27; occupants were vagrants, or the impoverished. The concept is that those buried within either owned boots in such disrepair that no one salvaged the footwear, thus the footwear was left on the bodies at burial; or that the deceased owned no nicer formal clothing to place upon their bodies, which resulted in being interred wearing whatever clothing, and boots, they did possess.

The second concept is fairly similar - that those buried within (having been hermits, passers-through, or vagrants) had no family to contact to claim the deceased&#x27;s valuables, which would include footwear.

Both of these concepts–one of poverty and worthless unsalvageable boots, the other of no next-of-kin to transfer ownership of valuables to–rely on the fact that during the 1800s, footwear had become expensive commodities. This is because a shift in shoes occurred in the 19th century. While all clothing could be made by people in the 1800s with moderate sewing skills, and doing so was quite common in the western frontier of the U.S., making shoes and boots had become a craft of cordwainers that required the expensive technical skills and specialized tools of the shoe makers. Prior to this era, everyday wear shoes and boots were frequently made from materials, and in limited pattern sizes, that could be easily made at home, then buckled and laced-up to create a formed fit for various sized feet. A switch was made from pliable materials to stiff form-keeping leathers, allowing for footwear that was no longer ambidextrous, but tailored to each foot&#x27;s specific shape, as well as individual length and width. This required further craftsmanship and work to create specifically bespoke footwear. Thus, the increased cost of Victorian footwear makes either of these two theories the most plausible.

The third concept is likely a romanticized one. This postulates that the occupants of Boot Hills were cowboys who &quot;died with their boots on&quot;, the implication here being they died violently, as in gunfights or by hanging, and not of natural causes. This idea is the most commonly cited on tourist websites. In addition to this claim having numerous problems in the logic used to support it (i.e., significant numbers of people die while wearing footwear, for all kinds of reasons), there is no evidence to suggest that gunfights and hangings were so ubiquitous that entire cemeteries all across the western U.S. needed to be devoted to these types of violent unnatural deaths.

Despite the mystery of the term today, Boot Hill became a commonplace term for the neglected old municipal cemeteries throughout the U.S. West during the late 1800s and into the early 1900s as, more and more, families of means re-interred their deceased loved ones to the more elegant and exclusive grounds of the newer for-profit cemeteries. However, some Boot Hills became famous, such as the original in Dodge City, Kansas, or the Boot Hill in Tombstone, Arizona, because of three men involved in the so-called O.K. Corral shootout still being buried there.

==Boothill Graveyard==
The most notable use of the name &quot;Boot Hill&quot; is at the Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone, Arizona. Formerly called the &quot;Tombstone Cemetery&quot;, the plot features the graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury; the three men who were killed during the famed Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

Located on the northwest corner of the town, the graveyard is believed to hold over 300 persons, 205 of which are recorded. This was due to some people (especially Chinese and Jewish immigrants) being buried without record. There is a separate Jewish cemetery nearby with some markers restored, and there are also marked graves of Chinese. However, most of the loss was due to neglect of grave markers and theft of these wooden relics as souvenirs. For example, when former Tombstone Mayor John Clum visited Tombstone for the first Helldorado celebration in 1929, he was unable to locate the grave of his wife Mary, who had been buried in Boothill.

The Tombstone &quot;boothill&quot; cemetery was closed in late 1886, as the new &quot;City Cemetery&quot; on Allen Street opened. Thereafter, Boothill was referred to as the &quot;old city cemetery&quot; and neglected. It was used after that only to bury a few later outlaws (some legally hanged and one shot in a robbery), as well as a few colorful Western characters and one man (Emmett Crook Nunnally) who had spent many volunteer hours restoring it.

Currently, the Boothill Graveyard is open to the public for a $5 fee, and is a popular stop for tourists visiting Tombstone.

==Boot Hill Museum==

The Boot Hill Museum is located on the original location of the Boot Hill Cemetery in Dodge City, Kansas.

==In popular culture==
Boot Hill is the name of the cemetery in Dodge City in the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; radio series. In many episodes, the marshal (Matt Dillon) would allude to &quot;putting you in Boot Hill&quot;, or &quot;another man headed to Boot Hill&quot;. In the first season of the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; television series, the introduction to each episode showed Matt Dillon walking around Boot Hill reflecting on the deaths of men buried there.

Boot Hill cemetery is a main plot point in the Twilight Zone episode &quot;Mr. Garrity and the Graves&quot;.

Boothill Graveyards are referenced in many films such as &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994), &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960) and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), during which it was repeatedly sung over the recurring title theme song by Frankie Laine. In the later half of the movie Laine changes the theme to:
&quot;Boot Hill&quot; is the name of a role playing game first published in 1975 by TSR, Inc., the original publisher of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It was the third game released by TSR and notable as one of the first games to use ten-sided dice.

Finnish Western writer Esa Paloniemi published his collection of Western short stories Saapaskukkula (Boothill) in 2024.

Boot Hill also appears in the first-person shooter video game &quot;Borderlands 2&quot;, located in &#x27;The Dust&#x27;, and playing home to a &#x27;truxican standoff&#x27;.

In the video game , Victor can say, “Next stop, Boot Hill” if provoked.

Carl Perkins wrote in 1959 a song &quot;The Ballad of Boot Hill&quot;. Johnny Cash recorded it for Columbia Records and it was released in the same year.

A Spaghetti Western named &quot;Boot Hill&quot; was released in 1969 and it featured Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.

The first of three parts that compose the Neil Young song &quot;Country Girl&quot;, that appears in his 1970 album with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, is called &quot;Whiskey Boot Hill&quot;.

The Outlaws&#x27; song &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot; also references &quot;lying&quot; an unnamed character in &quot;Boot Hill&quot;.

Several themes from Bob Dylan&#x27;s soundtrack album &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid&quot; (1973) contain the verse &quot;Up to Boot Hill they&#x27;d like to send ya&quot;.

The song &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; from Billy Joel&#x27;s 1973 Album &quot;Piano Man&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;And he never had a sweetheart, but he finally found a home, underneath the boothill grave that bears his name&quot;.

&quot;Boot Hill&quot; (unknown) is the first track on Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s 1991 posthumous release The Sky is Crying. It was recorded in early 1989 and is one of the last fully produced songs completed prior to his untimely death in 1990.

In Cricket, the term &#x27;Boot Hill&#x27; is used to refer to the fielding position of short-leg because of its proximity to the batsman and high likelihood of being hit by the ball, making the position particularly dangerous. Players fielding in this position typically wear a helmet and other protection.

In the comic book series &quot;Preacher&quot;, the Saint of Killers rests at a tomb on Boot Hill when not actively pursuing his goals.

Boot Hill Cemetery is the name of the graveyard at Phantom Manor in Disneyland Paris.

In season 5 episode 16 of the animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Pest of the West&quot;, the character Spongebuck is told the old sheriff of Dead-Eye Gulch is at Boot Hill.

Boothill is a playable character in .

<text>Postmodern theology, also known as the continental philosophy of religion, is a philosophical and theological movement that interprets Christian theology in light of postmodernism and various forms of post-Heideggerian thought, including post-structuralism, phenomenology, and deconstruction.

==History==
Postmodern theology emerged in the 1980s and 1990s when a handful of philosophers who took philosopher Martin Heidegger as a common point of departure began publishing influential books engaging with Christian theology. Some works of the era include Jean-Luc Marion&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;God Without Being&quot;, Mark C. Taylor&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Erring&quot;, Charles Winquist&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Desiring Theology&quot;, John D. Caputo&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida&quot;, and Carl Raschke&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;The End of Theology&quot;.

There are at least two branches of postmodern theology, each of which has evolved around the ideas of particular post-Heideggerian continental philosophers. Those branches are radical orthodoxy and weak theology.

===Radical orthodoxy===

Radical orthodoxy is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion, Paul Ricœur, and Michel Henry, among others.

Although radical orthodoxy is informally organized, its proponents often agree on a handful of propositions. First, there is no sharp distinction between reason on the one hand and faith or revelation on the other. In addition, the world is best understood through interactions with God, even though a full understanding of God is never possible. Those interactions include culture, language, history, technology, and theology. Further, God directs people toward truth, which is never fully available to them. In fact, a full appreciation of the physical world is only possible through a belief in transcendence. Finally, salvation is found through interactions with God and others.

Prominent advocates of radical orthodoxy include John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward.

===Weak theology===
Weak theology is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the deconstructive thought of Jacques Derrida, including Derrida&#x27;s description of a moral experience he calls &quot;the weak force.&quot; Weak theology rejects the idea that God is an overwhelming physical or metaphysical force. Instead, God is an unconditional claim without any force whatsoever. As a claim without force, the God of weak theology does not intervene in nature. As a result, weak theology emphasizes the responsibility of humans to act in this world here and now. John D. Caputo is a prominent advocate of the movement.

==Disputes==
In &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Digress: Christian Thinking on and about the Post/Modern Way&quot;, theologian Kevin J. Vanhoozer articulates the risk of correlating theology with postmodernism (or any other philosophy or discipline) as undermining the challenging doctrines of the Bible, in effect &quot;exchanging the scandal of the cross for the pottage of intellectual respectability.&quot; In this vein, theologian Douglas Groothuis argues that for Christian theology to resist postmodernism, it must adhere to Scripture as propositional truth. In contrast to postmodernism&#x27;s skepticism towards meta-narratives and its relativistic approach to truth, Scripture should be viewed as objective, universal, and factually accurate. Theologian Chul Min Jun suggests that modernism&#x27;s conformist tendencies and postmodernism&#x27;s pluralist inclinations are both rooted in a departure from the Trinity. Using pluralism to overcome conformism and vice versa cannot be transcended by theorizing. Rather than relying solely on language and definitions or on abandoning foundational truths altogether, it is necessary to directly follow the principles of the Triune God.

<text>Group Captain Leonard Henry Trent, (14 April 1915 – 19 May 1986) was a New Zealand aviator, senior Royal Air Force officer, and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Nelson, Trent obtained a short-term commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1938 after receiving flying training in New Zealand. After travelling to England, he was posted to No. 15 Squadron RAF and was sent to France shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, flying Fairey Battles on photo-reconnaissance missions into Germany. After his squadron returned to England and converted to Bristol Blenheims, he flew several bombing missions during the Battle of France for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Afterwards he spent several months on instructing duties before being posted to No. 487 (NZ) Squadron in August 1942, which operated Lockheed Venturas. He was shot down over Amsterdam while on a bombing mission, codenamed Operation Ramrod 16, on 3 May 1943, becoming a prisoner of war.

After the war, he was awarded the VC for his actions during Ramrod 16. He continued to serve with the RAF and was commander of No. 214 Squadron during the Suez Crisis. He retired in June 1965 and lived in Australia, and then New Zealand, in his later years. He died in 1986, aged 71.

==Early life==
Leonard Henry Trent was born in Nelson, New Zealand, on 14 April 1915, the son of Leonard Trent, a dentist, and his wife Irene . In April 1919 the family relocated to Tākaka, along the shore of Golden Bay. Three years later, his father paid for Trent to take a short flight in a Gipsy Moth piloted by Malcolm C. McGregor, a fighter ace of the First World War, and subsequently Trent became interested in flying. He was educated at Nelson College, boarding at the school from 1928. Not particularly academically inclined he became increasingly interested in golf and in his final year at school, in 1934, won the Nelson Golf Club Senior Championship.

Trent had intended to go to university to study dentistry, but the family could not afford to pay for his studies and he instead took up a position as a clerk in the administrative office of an abattoir in Hastings. He gave up the work after a year and returned to Nelson to assist his father in his dental practice. After a time he moved to Wellington taking up office work again. He was soon earning enough money that he could afford to go to night school and study aero engineering and maintenance.

==Early service career==
In early 1937, in response to an advertisement in a newspaper, Trent applied for a short-term commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF). He passed a selection interview and subsequent medical test and in August was accepted for flying training. Induction training was with the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and was held at Taieri, near Dunedin, where he flew Gipsy Moths and Miles Magisters. Trent then undertook flight training at the RNZAF&#x27;s Wigram Air Base in Christchurch, flying Avro 626 and Vickers Vildebeest aircraft. He gained his wings on 12 May 1938 and a month later he sailed for Britain to join the RAF. He was granted a short-service commission of five years in the rank of pilot officer on 23 August 1938.

Posted to No. 15 Squadron RAF, which operated Fairey Battles out of Abingdon in Berkshire, Trent spent the next few months learning bombing and reconnaissance flying techniques. In February 1939, he spent three months at Hamble, near Southampton, attending a navigation course. Here he met Ursula Woolhouse, while playing golf at the local club in his downtime.

==Second World War==
In early September 1939, following the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 15 Squadron flew to France as part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force. Stationed at Vraux, the squadron was to fly high-level photo-reconnaissance missions over enemy territory, collecting information on German airfields, factories and major infrastructure. Trent flew his first mission into Germany on 24 September 1939, No. 15 Squadron&#x27;s first operational sortie of the war. This period of the war was known as the Phoney War, and much the squadron&#x27;s flying revolved around training and practice bombing missions. The squadron was sent back to England in early December to convert to the Bristol Blenheim IV, a light bomber, operating from Wyton.

Initial conversion work was on the Bristol Blenheim I and during this time Trent had to make an emergency landing, having become lost in overcast conditions while on a flight to Scotland. In March 1940, he was promoted to flying officer. The squadron returned to operations when the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940. That day he flew one of three aircraft that bombed German forces at an aerodrome near Rotterdam. Further missions followed, including a bombing raid on bridges over the Albert Canal that saw six of the twelve participating aircraft destroyed. On another mission, his aircraft suffered damage from flak and an attacking Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and he put down at an airfield on the way back to his base for repairs. However, advancing Germans threatened the airfield and as night fell, he and his crew had to fly to England as they could not navigate back to their base in France. On 23 May, casualties in the squadron saw Trent take command of one of its flights in conjunction with a promotion to acting flight lieutenant. He led several bombing sorties while Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, was in effect and by mid-June had flown 14 sorties. Exhausted, he was sent on leave.

On his return to duty, Trent was posted to No. 17 Operational Training Unit, stationed at Upwood, as an instructor. He taught trainees formation flying and made navigational flights in Avro Ansons. He also had the opportunity to fly other aircraft; these included the Wellington bomber. In the meantime, his relationship with Ursula Woolhouse continued to grow and on 7 August 1940 the couple were married at Holborn, London. The previous month he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his outstanding performance during the Battle of France.

In March 1941, his flight lieutenant rank was made substantive and six months later Trent received a new posting at the Operational Training Squadron at Warboys. He helped assess the Douglas Boston bomber for service in the RAF; on his first flight in the aircraft, it suffered an engine fire forcing an immediate return to his base. Trent returned to operational duty in March 1942 and, promoted to temporary squadron leader on 1 June, was assigned to Headquarters, No. 2 Group RAF. He found the duty dull and began to seek a position at No. 88 Squadron where a friend of his was the squadron leader.

===Service with No. 487 Squadron===
In August 1942, the RAF established a new bomber squadron, designated No. 487 (NZ) Squadron, based at Feltwell in Norfolk. An Article XV squadron, many of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron. Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders. The squadron was to operate Lockheed Venturas; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crew members were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries.

On 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed Operation Ramrod 16, on a power station in Amsterdam. The mission was intended to be as a diversion for another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at Ijmuiden. &quot;Ramrod&quot; was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of Supermarine Spitfires. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences. 

One Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Bf 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Bf 109 with the forward machine guns of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his navigator were thrown clear at and became prisoners of war (POW). The remaining crew members, trapped in the aircraft, were unable to exit and were killed when it crashed.

===Stalag Luft III===
Trent was sent to Stalag Luft III, a POW camp well to the southeast of Berlin, in what is now Żagań, in Poland. He soon became involved in the various escape attempts mounted by the POWs, helping conceal the sand extracted from tunnels that were under construction.

He took part in the &quot;Great Escape&quot; of 24 March 1944. On exiting the tunnel, he had planned with another POW, Mike Shand, to head to Switzerland via Czechoslovakia and Austria. He was the 79th POW to pass through the escape tunnel, just behind Shand. However, as he was exiting the tunnel, a German guard thwarted his escape and Trent was recaptured almost immediately and placed in solitary confinement. The majority of the successful escapees were eventually recaptured, the Germans executing 50 of them. By January 1945, the Soviet forces were advancing into Germany and the POWs at Stalag Luft III were force marched away to the west to a camp near Bremen. They were moved again in April but were liberated by the British on 2 May 1945.

Trent returned to England on 7 May and went on leave for two months before reporting back for duty with the RAF. Preferring active flying to instructional duties, he requested a post at Transport Command. He qualified as a Douglas Dakota pilot and then spent a few months at Syerston, a paratrooper training school. In late 1945, Trent transferred back to RNZAF service. He wanted to pursue a career in the military and felt that the RNZAF offered better remuneration and promotion opportunities than the RAF.

==Victoria Cross==
On his return to duty, Trent had provided a written debrief on the Ramrod 16 raid. After considering Trent&#x27;s statements on the Ramrod 16 raid and other evidence collected by the Air Ministry, the commander of No. 2 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry, recommended him for the Victoria Cross (VC). Instituted in 1856, the VC was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on military personnel of the British Commonwealth. Having been informally advised that he was to be a recipient of the VC earlier that day, Trent&#x27;s award was publicly announced on 1 March 1946. The citation for Trent&#x27;s VC was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and read: 
Trent, with his wife present, received the VC from King George VI in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 26 March 1946.

==Post-war service career==
In late 1946, Trent and his family travelled by sea to Auckland in New Zealand for a period of extended leave before commencing service with the RNZAF. As a VC recipient, he attended a number of civic functions around the country and had his portrait painted by Archibald Nicoll. Once his leave had finished, his initial work for the RNZAF was as part of a committee to select fliers for service with the RAF, which was seeking to augment its ranks with experienced personnel. The RAF was also increasing rates of remuneration for its personnel and when it offered Trent a permanent commission, he accepted. He returned to England with his family, which now included a son, in late 1947 and resumed his career in the RAF with the substantive rank of flight lieutenant.

Trent was posted to Bircham Newton, a Transport Command station, as an instructor to help prepare students to fly Dakotas. In September 1948, having been promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader earlier in the year, he was sent to Dishforth which trained pilots to fly the Avro York transport. He flew several operations during the Berlin airlift but soon began to suffer from ankylosing spondylitis which required specialist treatment for a few months before he could return to duty.

Now posted to Flying Training Command, in August 1950 Trent undertook refresher and leadership courses before going on to Central Flying School early the following year. Trent returned to Feltwell, where he had been based while at No. 487 Squadron, in March 1951. He was chief instructor at No. 3 Flying Training School, teaching students to fly the Harvard trainer. In October 1952, he was appointed squadron commander of No. 4 Squadron, which was based at Little Rissington and operated de Havilland Vampires. The following year, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, promoted to wing commander and posted to Oakington where he instructed on Gloster Meteors. While there, he had to bail out of a Meteor which had gone into an unrecoverable spin. Not long afterwards, in early 1954, with the flight school having re-equipped with Vampires, Trent had to again bail out when he lost control of his aircraft.

In early 1956, after attending a six-month course at No. 6 Flying College Course at Manby, Trent was appointed commander of No. 214 Squadron, which was the first unit to be equipped with the new Vickers Valiant. Later that year, in October, his squadron was dispatched to Malta due to the outbreak of the Suez Crisis and flew a number of missions into Egypt. The squadron returned to England at the end of year when tensions eased. In March 1958, he flew a Valiant to New Zealand as part of the celebrations for the twenty-first anniversary of the founding of the RNZAF. The next month, he took up a post as Wing Commander Training at No. 3 Group Headquarters at Mildenhall and was promoted to the rank of group captain on 1 July 1959.

Trent was appointed station commander at RAF Wittering in April 1960. He still occasionally flew Valiants, including taking one on a goodwill tour to the United States. He then served as an air attaché, representing Bomber Command at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. from mid-1962, and on 12 June the same year, he was appointed an air aide-de-camp to the Queen. As the Queen never visited Washington, D.C. during his tenure there, he was never called upon to serve in this role. After three years, his service in the United States ended and he retired from the RAF on 23 June 1965.

==Later life==
Following his retirement in 1965, Trent moved his family to Western Australia. With his wife, he later returned to New Zealand to live at Matheson Bay, north of Auckland. He died on 19 May 1986 at North Shore Hospital, survived by his wife and two children. He was cremated and his ashes were taken to Western Australia, where they were interred at Fremantle Cemetery alongside those of his daughter, Judith, who had predeceased him.

Trent&#x27;s medals, including the VC, are held by the Air Force Museum of New Zealand at Wigram in Christchurch. There is a memorial to Trent at the airport in Nelson, his home town, and there is also a plaque honouring him in Queens Gardens in Dunedin. Trent Street in the suburb of Taradale, Napier in New Zealand was renamed in his honour in 1969.

<text>VM (Edemo) is a &quot;V-series&quot; nerve agent closely related to the better-known VX nerve agent.

Like most of the agents in the V-series (with the exception of VX), VM has not been extensively studied outside of military science. Little is known about this chemical compound other than its chemical formula.

It is commonly theorized that the so-called &quot;second-generation&quot; V series agents came from a Cold War era Russian chemical weapons development program. They may have been developed sometime between 1950 and 1990. They have similar lethal dose levels to VX (between 10 and 50 mg) and have similar symptoms and method of action to other nerve agents that act on cholinesterase. The treatment remains the same, but the window for effectively treating second generation V series seizures is shorter. In addition to the standard seizures, some of the second generation V series agents are known to cause comas.

<text>Fat choy (; Nostoc flagelliforme) is a terrestrial cyanobacterium (a type of photosynthetic bacteria) that is used as a vegetable in Chinese cuisine. When dried, the product has the appearance of black hair. For that reason, its name in Chinese means &quot;hair vegetable&quot;. When soaked, fat choy has a soft texture which is like very fine vermicelli.

==Production==
Fat choy grows on the ground in the Gobi Desert and the Qinghai Plateau. Over-harvesting on the Mongolian steppes has furthered erosion and desertification in those areas. The Chinese government has limited its harvesting, which has caused its price to increase.

Commercially available fat choy has been found to be adulterated with strands of a non-cellular starchy material, with other additives and dyes. Real fat choy is dark green in color, while the counterfeit fat choy appears black.

== Use ==

===China===
Its name in Cantonese sounds like a Cantonese phrase meaning &quot;struck it rich&quot; (though the second syllable, &quot;coi&quot;, has a different tone) -- this is found, for example, in the Cantonese saying, &quot;Gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4&quot; (, meaning &quot;wishing you prosperity&quot;), often proclaimed during Chinese New Year. Therefore, it is a popular ingredient for Chinese New Year dishes, such as in the reunion dinner. It is mostly used in Cantonese cuisine and Buddhist cuisine. It is sometimes used as a hot pot ingredient.

Due to its high price, fat choy is considered a luxury food, and only used in limited occasions. It is not eaten as a staple.

==Health effects==
&quot;N. flagelliforme&quot; has no nutritional value, and also contains beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a toxic amino acid that could affect the normal functions of nerve cells and is linked to degenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, and dementia. Not all real &quot;fat choy&quot; samples contain BMAA according to a 2009 study, with the maximum concentration being 658.5 ng/g. Imitation &quot;fat choy&quot; does not contain BMAA.

Across a 28-day duration, laboratory rats fed &quot;N. flagelliforme&quot; and the control group did not exhibit significant differences in any toxicological parameters.

The algae and its extracts reduce the inflammatory action of white blood cells, specifically macrophages and splenocytes, &quot;in vitro&quot;.

<text>The singles discography of Eric Clapton consists of 24 early career singles that Clapton recorded with various groups and singers including The Yardbirds, John Mayall &amp; the Blues Breakers, Cream, John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band as well as Derek and the Dominos. As a solo performer, Clapton released 91 singles and various promotional formats from 1970 to date. His most commercially successful singles are &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, &quot;Change the World&quot;, &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;, released in 1974, charting substantially better than Marley&#x27;s own earlier release had, becoming a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one hit.

Clapton&#x27;s best-selling single is &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; which has sold more than four million copies worldwide, although he is most known for his rock song &quot;Layla&quot;, which was originally released in 1971. Clapton later rerecorded the song acoustically for his 1992 &quot;Unplugged&quot; million-seller, which helped to cement Clapton&#x27;s reputation as both a guitarist and singer. The British rock musician also collaborated with friends along his extensive solo career. Featured singles with artists like George Harrison, Elton John, Sting, Cher, Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry and Zucchero Fornaciari helped to uplift Clapton&#x27;s single performances.

<text>Myrmeciinae is a subfamily of the Formicidae, ants once found worldwide but now restricted to Australia and New Caledonia. This subfamily is one of several ant subfamilies which possess gamergates, female worker ants which are able to mate and reproduce, thus sustaining the colony after the loss of the queen. The Myrmeciinae subfamily was formerly composed of only one genus, &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, but the subfamily was redescribed by Ward &amp; Brady in 2003 to include two tribes and four genera. An additional three genera, one form genus, and 9 species were described in 2006 from the Early Eocene of Denmark, Canada, and Washington. Subsequently an additional fossil genus was moved from the family Rhopalosomatidae in 2018, and a new genus was described in 2021.

==Tribes and genera==
*Tribe Myrmeciini 
**&quot;Myrmecia&quot; 
*Tribe Prionomyrmecini 
**&quot;Nothomyrmecia&quot; 
**†&quot;Prionomyrmex&quot; 
**†&quot;Propalosoma&quot; 
**†&quot;Tyrannomecia&quot; 
**†&quot;Ypresiomyrma&quot; 
*Tribe &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
**†&quot;Archimyrmex&quot; 
**†&quot;Avitomyrmex&quot; 
**†&quot;Macabeemyrma&quot; 
*Form genus (for species belonging to the subfamily but not identifiable to current genera)
**†&quot;Myrmeciites&quot; 

The Late Aptian Crato Formation genus &quot;Cariridris&quot; was sometimes included in Myrmeciinae, but it has is now usually classified within Ampulicidae. Two undescribed specimens in the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart are known, suggesting a myrmeciine affinity.

==Classification==
The subfamily Myrmeciinae was established by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1877 under the original name Myrmeciidae. It was named after the genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, the type genus of the subfamily. In 1882, the subfamily was treated as a tribe by French entomologist Ernest André within the former ant family Myrmicidae, but it would later be moved to the family Poneridae in 1905.

<text>The KDLT towers is the name given to two towers (one analog and one digital) used by South Dakota television station KDLT. In May 2022 the analog tower was destroyed during a wind storm. 

The towers were built as high guy-wired aerial masts for the transmission of TV programs. The original analog tower was built in 1976 near Salem, South Dakota, and was . The digital tower was erected in 1998 near Rowena, South Dakota, and is , making it one of the tallest structures in the world. The digital tower is owned by Gray Media Group, Inc, as was the analog tower.

==Beacon lights==
The aircraft-warning beacon lights at the top of the digital tower must be replaced when they malfunction. When it was standing, and even when it was not in use, the same applied of the analog tower. Replacement of the beacon bulb at the top of the digital tower was featured in an episode of &quot;World&#x27;s Toughest Fixes&quot; in 2010. In 2015, amateur drone video footage of a man changing the light bulb on the analog tower went viral attracting more than 19 million views on YouTube and garnering attention from CNN and a newspaper in Britain. On learning of the drone footage, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forbade any further flights; without its approval, drones are restricted by law to a ceiling of , far lower than the height of the tower.

==Destruction of analog tower==
The analog tower near Salem was destroyed on May 12, 2022 during a wind storm. It had stood since 1976.

<doc id="1140503" wikidata="Q60855" url="?curid=1140503" title="Jasmine tea">
<text>Jasmine tea ( or ) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms. Typically, jasmine tea has green tea as the tea base; however, white tea and black tea are also used. The resulting flavour of jasmine tea is subtly sweet and highly fragrant. It is the most famous scented tea in China.

The jasmine plant is believed to have been introduced into China from eastern South Asia via India during the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), and was being used to scent tea around the fifth century. However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing dynasty (1644 to 1912 AD), when tea started to be exported in large quantities to the West. Nowadays, it is still a common drink served in tea shops around the world.

The jasmine plant is grown at high elevations in the mountains. Jasmine tea produced in the Chinese province of Fujian has the best reputation. Jasmine tea is also produced in the provinces of Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang. Japan is also known for the production of jasmine tea, especially in Okinawa Prefecture, where it is called .

==Preparation==
Tea leaves are harvested in the early spring and stored until the late summer when fresh jasmine flowers are in bloom. Jasmine flowers are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night, jasmine flowers open, releasing their fragrance. This is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine. In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers; in the other, the tea is blended with jasmine flowers and stored overnight. It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao. The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.

== Cultural uses ==

In southern China, it is customary to serve Jasmine tea as a welcoming gesture to guests. Jasmine tea is the local tea beverage of Fuzhou, while jasmine flowers are its municipal flower.

Jasmine has symbolic meanings in the Chinese culture. For example, the crown of the Buddhist in the Ajanta wall paintings, a world heritage site, is decorated by golden jasmine flowers. The fragrance of jasmines is thought to be of heaven. In the past, people in Fuzhou considered tea as an antidote to many poisons. In the Fuzhou dialect, the word for buying medicine literally means buying tea; brewing medicine, brewing tea; taking medicine, drinking tea. In addition, tea culture is important by shaping the art of drinking tea which follows different steps.

== Fuzhou jasmine tea ==
Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian, is the most important city in producing jasmine tea in China.
The city is built at a river basin and surrounded by mountains. The climate in Fuzhou is mild, rainfall is abundant and the day-night temperature difference is obvious, creating favorable conditions for jasmine flowers to grow. And there is also the microclimate needed for tea trees—jasmines are planted near rivers, while tea trees grow on slopes between above sea level. According to the &quot;China Daily&quot; newspaper, &quot;Fuzhou has 1,200 hectares of tea gardens and [in 2011] it produced 110,000 tons of jasmine tea, worth 1.78 billion yuan ().&quot;

After the jasmine plant was introduced into Fuzhou, people planted the flower broadly. Between 960 and 1127 AD (during the Song dynasty), Fuzhou gained the name of &quot;The City of Jasmine in China&quot;. Fuzhou is regarded as the origin of the jasmine tea production process, and so far it is the only city to contain the complete production process. The jasmine tea making process began during the Tang dynasty but changed substantially during the Ming dynasty. Prior to 1937, the development of Fuzhou jasmine tea was fast and products were sold to many regions. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, output dropped quickly. From the 1950s through the 1990s, the jasmine tea industry revived and reached 60% of the total national production, but subsequently fell again.

The Chinese government is still working on reviving Fuzhou jasmine tea. In recent years, the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and government strove to protect and develop the system of Fuzhou jasmine planting and tea culture, and took active measures to cultivate good stock and applied for the heritage list[which one?].

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recognized the &quot;Fuzhou jasmine tea and tea culture system&quot; as a &quot;Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System&quot;. Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations went to Fuzhou to inspect the process on April 5, 2014, after which, it was awarded the &quot;Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System&quot; title in Rome, Italy, on April 29, 2014.

<doc id="1140515" wikidata="Q1065367" url="?curid=1140515" title="Hutong">
<text>Hutong () are a type of narrow street or alley commonly associated with northern Chinese cities, especially Beijing.

In Beijing, &quot;hutongs&quot; are alleys formed by lines of &quot;siheyuan&quot;, traditional courtyard residences. Many neighbourhoods were formed by joining one &quot;siheyuan&quot; to another to form a hutong, and then joining one hutong to another. The word hutong is also used to refer to such neighbourhoods.

Since the mid-20th century, many Beijing hutongs were demolished to make way for new roads and buildings. More recently, however, many hutongs have been designated as protected, in an attempt to preserve this aspect of Chinese cultural history. Hutongs were first established in the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) and then expanded in the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties.

== Historical hutongs ==
During China&#x27;s dynastic period, emperors planned the city of Beijing and arranged the residential areas according to the social classes of the Zhou dynasty (1027–256 BC). The term &quot;hutong&quot; appeared first during the Yuan Dynasty, and is a term of Mongolian origin, meaning &quot;water well&quot;.

In the Ming Dynasty (early 15th century), the center was the Forbidden City, surrounded in concentric circles by the Inner City and Outer City. Citizens of higher social status were permitted to live closer to the center of the circles. Aristocrats lived to the east and west of the imperial palace. The large siheyuan of these high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants often featured beautifully carved and painted roof beams and pillars and carefully landscaped gardens. The hutongs they formed were orderly, lined by spacious homes and walled gardens. Farther from the palace, and to its north and south, were the commoners, merchants, artisans, and laborers. Their siheyuan were far smaller in scale and simpler in design and decoration, and the hutongs were narrower.

Nearly all &quot;siheyuan&quot; had their main buildings and gates facing south for better lighting; thus a majority of hutongs run from east to west. Between the main hutongs, many tiny lanes ran north and south for convenient passage.

Historically, a hutong was also once used as the lowest level of administrative geographical divisions within a city in ancient China, as in the paifang (牌坊) system: the largest division within a city in ancient China was a &quot;fang&quot; (坊), equivalent to current day ward. Each fang (坊) was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night, somewhat like a modern gated community. Each fang (坊) was further divided into several &quot;plate&quot; or &quot;pai&quot; (牌), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community (or neighborhood). Each pai (牌), in turn, contained an area including several hutongs, and during the Ming Dynasty, Beijing was divided into a total of 36 fangs (坊).

However, as the ancient Chinese urban administration division system gave way to population and household divisions instead of geographical divisions, the hutongs were no longer used as the lowest level of administrative geographical division and were replaced with other divisional approaches.

== In the Republic of China era ==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Qing court was disintegrating as China&#x27;s dynastic era came to an end. The traditional arrangement of hutongs was also affected. Many new hutongs, built haphazardly and with no apparent plan, began to appear on the outskirts of the old city, while the old ones lost their former neat appearance. The social stratification of the residents also began to evaporate, reflecting the collapse of the feudal system.

Many such &quot;hutong&quot;-like areas have been demolished. During the period of the Republic of China from 1911 to 1948, society was unstable, fraught with civil wars and repeated foreign invasions. Beijing deteriorated, and the conditions of the hutongs worsened. Siheyuans previously owned and occupied by single families were subdivided and shared by many households, with additions tacked on as needed, built with whatever materials were available. The 978 hutongs listed in Qing Dynasty records swelled to 1,330 by 1949. Today in 2008, in some hutongs, such as those in Da Shi Lan, the conditions remain poor.

== In the People&#x27;s Republic ==

As China&#x27;s urbanization greatly increased, many of Beijing&#x27;s &quot;hutong&quot;s were demolished during the period 1989-2019, with remaining lanes often converted into tourist attractions as objects of historic preservation.

Many hutongs, some several hundred years old, in the vicinity of the Bell Tower and Drum Tower and Shichahai Lake are preserved amongst recreated contemporary two- and three-story versions. This area abounds with tourists, many of which tour the quarter in pedicabs.

Today, as in the past, hutongs are home to celebrities, business owners and officials. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, Zhao Ziyang spent his fifteen years of house arrest inside a hutong. Zhao&#x27;s hutong had previously been occupied by one of Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s hairdressers.

== Culture ==
Hutongs represent an important cultural element of the city of Beijing. Thanks to Beijing&#x27;s long history and status as capital for six dynasties, almost every hutong has its anecdotes, and some are even associated with historic events. In contrast to the court life and elite culture represented by the Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, the hutongs reflect the culture of grassroots Beijingers. The hutongs are residential neighborhoods which still form the heart of Old Beijing.

From 2014 to 2019, an exploration game was played called 胡同谜踪 or &quot;Hutong Races&quot;. Teams explore hutongs within one city block in detail and complete activities based on art, food, calligraphy, history and technology and often with local businesses.

== Other information ==
Each hutong has a name. Some have had only one name since their creation, while others have had several throughout their history.

Many &quot;hutong&quot;s were named after their location, or a local landmark or business, such as:
*City gates, such as Inner Xizhimen Hutong, indicating this &quot;hutong&quot; is located in the &quot;Xizhimen Nei&quot;, or &quot;Xizhimen Within&quot;, neighbourhood, which is on the city side of Xizhimen Gate, a gate on the city wall.
*Markets and businesses, such as Yangshi Hutong (&quot;Yangshi&quot; literally means sheep market), or Yizi Hutong (a local term for soap is &quot;yizi&quot;)
*Temples, such as Guanyinsi Hutong (&quot;Guanyinsi&quot; is the Kuan-yin Temple)
*Local features, such as Liushu Hutong (&quot;Liushu&quot; means willow), which was originally named &quot;Liushujing Hutong&quot;, literally &quot;Willow Tree Well Hutong&quot;, after a local well.

Some &quot;hutong&quot;s were named after people, such as Mengduan Hutong (named after Meng Duan, a mayor of Beijing in the Ming Dynasty whose residence was in this &quot;hutong&quot;).

Others were given an auspicious name, with words with generic positive attributes, such as Xiqing Hutong (&quot;Xiqing&quot; means happy)

&quot;Hutong&quot;s sharing a name, or longer &quot;hutong&quot;s divided into sections, are often identified by direction. for example, there are three Hongmen Hutong (&quot;Red Gate Hutong&quot;), being the West Hongmen Hutong, the East Hongmen Hutong, and the South Hongmen Hutong (all three &quot;hutong&quot;s have been obliterated as of 2011 and no longer exist).

While most Beijing hutongs are straight, Jiudaowan Hutong turns nineteen times. Located near Beixinqiao Station, its name 九道弯 literally means &quot;Nine Turns&quot;.

At its narrowest section, Qianshi Hutong near Qianmen (Front Gate) is only 40 centimeters wide.

<text>Arclight (Philippa Sontag) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., she is a former military officer who later becomes an assassin. She is primarily known as a member the original Marauders team, a group of mutants who often work for the mad scientist villain Mister Sinister. As a Marauder, she has often fought the X-Men as well as related teams and heroes such as X-Factor and X-Force. Like many of the Marauders, Arclight has been killed in battle more than once, only to be revived each time by Sinister through advanced cloning techniques.

The character has made scattered minor appearances throughout other forms of media, such as animated television series and the film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, portrayed by Omahyra Mota, and the video game &quot;Deadpool&quot;, voiced by Chani Krich.

==Publication history==
Arclight first appeared in silhouette in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #210 (Oct. 1986), then made her first full appearance the following month in issue #211 (Nov. 1986). Both issues served as chapters in the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; crossover that involved the X-Men, the spin-off team X-Factor, and other Marvel Comics heroes such as Thor, Power Pack, and Daredevil. Arclight, along with many of the Marauders, was created specifically for the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; story by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr. In reference to this crossover, &quot;X-Factor&quot; writer/artist Walt Simonson said that &quot;when Jon Bogdanove drew Arclight in &quot;Power Pack&quot;, she had a much different figure than I gave her in &quot;X-Factor&quot;. But I went back and did a little bit of revision work in my book after I&#x27;d seen what John had done&quot;.

Originally, Arclight is said to be a veteran of the Vietnam War. Eventually, this proved problematic since modern Marvel Comics stories exist on a sliding timeline: new comics take place around the date of publication (unless specifically said otherwise) while events in the past are now understood to be pushed forward from their original publication date, compressing time so that characters do not age too rapidly or in real-time. Since characters such as Arclight age at the rate of a normal human being, it became uncertain how they could seem to be in their prime in 21st-century stories yet have served in the Vietnam War. A similar problem existed for characters such as the Punisher. To address this, the 2019 mini-series &quot;History of the Marvel Universe&quot; revised canon, revealing that a war was fought for decades in the fictional Asian country Siancong, ending only a few years before the rise of the modern superhero era. As a result, Arclight and other characters are now said to be veterans of the Siancong War.

Following conflicts with the X-Men in &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; and the 1989 crossover &quot;Inferno&quot;, Arclight was depicted as a member of the Femizons team in the comic book series Captain America (volume 1). She was then seen again as a member of the Marauders in 1996 and was often part of the team in their subsequent stories.

In the 2019 event &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, a new mutant community was formed on the living island Krakoa, providing sanctuary and amnesty for mutants everywhere. While Mister Sinister and the Marauder known as Scalphunter relocated to the island, Arclight and the other original Marauders (with the exception of Sabretooth) decided to shun the offer of amnesty. &quot;Dawn of X&quot; featured a new team calling itself the Marauders formed on Krakoa, led by Kitty Pryde and involving several former X-Men members. The 2020 series &quot;Hellions&quot; revealed that Arclight and her other old teammates had made their new home in the Essex State Home for Foundlings, an orphanage formerly owned by Sinister where he secretly kept a lab and clone banks.

==Fictional character biography==
As part of the US military, Philipa Sontag serves with the ground forces during the Siancong War. Sontag&#x27;s traumatic experiences during the war haunt her for years afterward. She projects her trauma and rage into bodybuilding and mercenary work, becoming a bloodthirsty assassin. Already a mutant born with enhanced strength and stamina, Sontag&#x27;s training makes her proportionately stronger and more formidable. Sontag also trains in how to best use her mutant shock wave power in combat, combing it with her super strength in form of punches and blows.

Several years after the Siancong War, the super-powered geneticist Mister Sinister decides to wipe out a community of sewer-dwelling mutants called Morlocks. Obsessed with improving mutations in mutants and creating a perfect race of superhumans, Sinister believes the Morlocks (many of whom are physically deformed or disabled by their mutant abilities) will pollute the gene pool. He also learns that many Morlocks were further mutated by scientific methods based on his own research (performed by the villain Dark Beast), and is offended that his &quot;signature&quot; was used without permission. Already regularly working with the mutant assassin Scalphunter, Sinister decides that for the Morlocks he will need an entire team of warriors. He asks the mutant criminal Gambit to track down and recruit mutant killers. In exchange, Sinister agrees to cure Gambit of a defect that will cause him to lose control of his powers. Gambit recruits Arclight as well as others, and they form Sinister&#x27;s first team of Marauders. Scalphunter, a US Army veteran and Sinister&#x27;s long-time accomplice, is the team field leader. Arclight becomes second-in-command.

Before engaging on their mission against the Morlocks, Sinister sends the Marauders to kidnap Nathan Summers, the recently born child of Cyclops. Once Nathan is secured, Sinister then sends the Marauders into the sewers of New York and the team engages in wholesale slaughter. Their attack becomes known as the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;. Arclight herself kills dozens of Morlocks before the Marauders are attacked by heroes such as the X-Men and X-Factor, forcing them to retreat.

Months later, the Marauders are involved in the &quot;Inferno&quot; crossover, during which forces of Hell are unleashed on Earth. Arclight and several Marauders are killed during the crossover, but resurrected by Mister Sinister&#x27;s cloning technology. Mister Sinister combines his mental powers with his genetic manipulation to ensure that all the clones will not betray him.

The terrorist Superia plots to conquer the world, hoping to dominate men and sterilize all other women. To help her overthrow society, she recruits an army of women warriors, including Arclight. After learned that there exists a possible future where Earth is ruled by women overlords called Femizons, Superia names her own present-day army &quot;the Femizons&quot;. Her efforts are thwarted by a collection of fighters led by Captain America. Although Superia later creates a new, smaller group of Femizons, Arclight does not join them. Instead, she works alongside the Marauders again, often capturing mutant test subjects or fighting heroes such as Cable, all at the command of Mister Sinister.

The Marauders attack the powerful mutant Nate Grey, who uses his telepathy to cause Arclight to kill her teammate Blockbuster. Nate Grey then causes the Marauder called Riptide to kill Arclight. All are later resurrected by Sinister&#x27;s clone farm.

Due to the event called M-Day, most of Earth&#x27;s mutants lose their X-gene and the mutant abilities it granted. It is determined that only 198 mutants retain their X-gene, with Arclight being one of them. For a time, she takes refuge at the X-Men&#x27;s home, the school that is nicknamed &quot;the X-Mansion&quot;. Later on, Arclight leaves, eventually joining the New Marauders team that includes former X-Men members. This team fights the X-Men and other heroes in the crossoverMessiah CompleX. During this crossover, Arclight joins a battle on Muir Island and is seriously injured by Wolfsbane, who bites her in the throat. She is later seen having recovered (or having been cloned again), only to then be defeated by Rockslide. Arclight later rejoins the Marauders when the team is briefly reorganized under the leadership of Da&#x27;o Coy Manh, the half-sister of the mutant known as Karma.

Deciding they are long overdue for vengeance in the name of the Morlocks their predecessors killed, Magneto hunts down and kills these clones, including Arclight. After tracking a group of remaining clones that have yet to be activated, Magneto decides instead to alter their personalities to obey his own commands in the future. Magneto later unleashes his loyal Marauder clones against the international intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., using them as a distraction while he destroys much of the organization&#x27;s collected data on mutants. Magneto and his Marauders then retreat and go separate ways. Eventually, Mister Sinister forms a new team of Marauders.

The Marauders later reform with Scalphunter, Arclight, Harpoon, Blockbuster, Vertigo, and Malice. The X-Men confronts this group, accusing them of committing a second Morlock Massacre. The Marauders deny this charge, but the X-Man Chamber burns them alive with his psionic flame. As he burns, Harpoon impales Chamber in the back, killing the young mutant. The Marauders are later seen again without injury, indicating they were once again cloned by Sinister.

In the 2019 event &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, a new mutant community is formed under the direction of former enemies Charles Xavier and Magneto. The new community takes up residence on the living island Krakoa, providing sanctuary and amnesty for mutants (and only mutants). Scalphunter joins the community and Mister Sinister is invited to serve in its governing body, the Quiet Council. Arclight and the other original Marauders (with the exception of Sabretooth) decide to shun the offer of amnesty. Arclight and her other old teammates take refuge in the Essex State Home for Foundlings, an orphanage formerly owned by Sinister where he secretly kept a lab and clone banks.

==Powers and abilities==
Arclight can generate seismic force from her hands, causing short-range shock waves and tremors in the immediate area. In some comics, a flash of light accompanies her powers. She has developed a fighting style where she releases a shockwave simultaneously while throwing her fist, creating a shattering punch effect. Along with this, her mutant X-gene grants her superhuman strength, stamina, and resistance to injury. Her extensive strength training has made her even stronger and more formidable. Arclight has military training in jungle survival, hand-to-hand combat, and various firearms and explosives.

Arclight has died in action but been repeatedly resurrected by Mister Sinister&#x27;s cloning techniques. This process seems to involve a full transfer of personality and memories, effectively keeping Arclight as the same person, though now with programming that prevents her from betraying Mister Sinister.

<text>VG (IUPAC name: &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-diethyl &quot;S&quot;-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothioate) (also called Amiton or Tetram) is a &quot;V-series&quot; nerve agent chemically similar to the better-known VX nerve agent. Tetram is the common Russian name for the substance. Amiton was the trade name for the substance when it was marketed as an insecticide by ICI in the mid-1950s.

==Chemical==
With a toxicity of about 1/10 that of VX, i.e. similar to that of sarin, it is now considered too dangerous for use in agriculture but unlike other nerve agents it is classified under Schedule 2 of the Chemical Weapons Convention rather than the more restrictive Schedule 1. It is thought that North Korea may have military stockpiles of this chemical

During the early 1950s at least three chemical companies working on organo-phosphorus insecticides independently discovered the severe toxicity of these chemicals. In 1952, Dr. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist working for ICI at their Plant Protection Laboratories at Jealott&#x27;s Hill was investigating the potential of organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols for use as pesticides. Like the earlier German investigators of organophosphates in the late 1930s who had discovered the G-series nerve agents, Dr. Ghosh discovered that their action on cholinesterase made them effective pesticides. One of them, Amiton, was described in a 1955 paper by Ghosh and another chemist, J. F. Newman, as being particularly effective against mites. It was brought to market as an insecticide by the company in 1954 but was subsequently withdrawn as too toxic. 

The toxicity of these substances had not passed unnoticed by the British Government, as some of the compounds had already been sent to their research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. Some of the chemicals from this class of compounds formed a new group of nerve agents called V Agents. The British Government unilaterally renounced chemical and biological weapons in 1956, although in 1958 traded their research on VG technology with the United States Government in exchange for information on thermonuclear weapons. The US then went into production of large amounts of the chemically similar, but much more toxic VX in 1961.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

<doc id="1140522" wikidata="Q7120511" url="?curid=1140522" title="Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive classification">
<text>Locomotive classification on the Pennsylvania Railroad took several forms. Early on, steam locomotives were given single-letter classes. As the 26 letters were quickly assigned, that scheme was abandoned for a more complex system. This was used for all of the PRR&#x27;s steam locomotives, and — with the exception of the final type bought (the E44) — all electric locomotives also used this scheme.

== PRR steam and electric classification ==

=== A: 0-4-0 ===

Class A was the 0-4-0 type, an arrangement best suited to small switcher locomotives (known as &quot;shifters&quot; in PRR parlance). Most railroads abandoned the 0-4-0 after the 1920s, but the PRR kept it for use on small industrial branches, especially those with street trackage and tight turns.

* A1
* A2
* A3
* A4
* A5s
* A6

=== B: 0-6-0 ===

Class B comprised the 0-6-0 type, the most popular arrangement for switcher locomotives on the PRR.

* B1 (Steam)
* B1 (Electric)
* B2
* B3
* B4
* B5 - Rebuilt from class H1 and H2a 2-8-0
* B6
* B7 - Some rebuilt from class H3, H3a, and H3b 2-8-0
* B8
* B21
* B22
* B23
* B28s
* B29

=== C: 0-8-0 ===

Class C was assigned to the 0-8-0 type. These were very common on other railroads, but the PRR was not keen on them and only built a few. This was partly because the PRR used 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; types for similar service.

* C1 - Largest 2-cylinder 0-8-0 ever built
* C29
* C30
* C31

=== D: 4-4-0 ===

Class D was the 4-4-0 &quot;American&quot; type, the most common arrangement in 19th Century American railroading. 4-4-0s stayed in service on the PRR in secondary work later than on most other railroads, and three were in use until after World War II

=== E: 4-4-2 ===

The 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; type was assigned class E. The PRR was an enthusiastic user of the Atlantic type in flatter country, and built some of the most advanced Atlantics used in the United States.

* E1
* E2
* E3
* E4
* E5
* E6
* E7
* E21
* E22
* E23
* E28 - Compound
* E29 - Compound
* &quot;de Glehn&quot; #2512, a single experimental compound locomotive

=== F: 2-6-0 ===

The 2-6-0 &quot;Mogul&quot; type was assigned class F. On the PRR, this type was used during the period of 1895–1925, approximately. They were mostly used to haul express freight, although some hauled suburban passenger trains.

* F1
* F2 - Compound
* F3
* F21
* F22
* F23
* F24
* F25
* F26
* F27
* F30
* F31
* F61

=== G: 4-6-0 ===

* G1
* G2
* G3
* G4
* G5 - Largest 10 wheeler built. PRR constructed 90 for use in commuter service and then built 30 for their subsidiary the Long Island RR.
* G53 - Owned By subsidiary Long Island RR

=== H: 2-8-0 ===

* H1
* H2
* H3
* H4
* H5
* H6
* H8
* H9
* H10

=== I: 2-10-0 ===

The 2-10-0 &quot;Decapod&quot; type was assigned class I. The PRR only owned one type of Decapod, class I1s, but they owned 598 of them, one of the largest classes of identical power in the United States.

* I1s - heavy freight hauler.

=== J: 2-6-2 and 2-10-4 ===

Class J was first used for two experimental 2-6-2 &quot;Prairie&quot; locomotives built by ALCO in 1905. These were both withdrawn from service by the mid-1920s. In 1942, the PRR built 123 2-10-4 &quot;Texas&quot; type locomotives based on C&amp;O plans; class J now being unoccupied, it was reused for them. The PRR J1 was an improved version of its C&amp;O counterpart with more pulling power.

* J1 - 2-10-4 freight locomotives.
* J28 - experimental 2-6-2 locomotives.

=== K: 4-6-2 ===

The PRR assigned class K to the 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; type. The Pacific was the most common type of passenger locomotive on the Pennsylvania.

* K2 - 153 built at Altoona 1910-1911
* K3s - 30 built by Baldwin in 1913.
* K4s - 425 built by the PRR and Baldwin 1914-1928.
* K5 - 2 prototypes built

=== L: 2-8-2 ===

Class L was assigned to the 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot; type.

* L1s - freight twin to the famed K4s Pacific (575 built)
* L2s - the USRA standard light Mikado (5 built for PRR).
* L5 - PRR 2nd generation DC electric locomotive.
* L6 - PRR freight AC electric locomotives.

=== M: 4-8-2 ===

* M1 - mixed-traffic Mountain type, latterly mostly used on fast freight.

=== N: 2-10-2 ===

* N1s - Lines West heavy freight locomotive.
* N2s - USRA Standard 2-10-2, also used on Lines West.

=== O: 4-4-4 ===

The 4-4-4 arrangement was rare anywhere, and on the PRR it was found only on eight experimental electric locomotives.

* O1 - experimental electric locomotives.

=== P: 4-6-4 ===

The 4-6-4 arrangement was seen on the PRR only on electric locomotives. As a steam locomotive arrangement, it was poorly suited to the PRR&#x27;s mountainous terrain, wasting much potential adhesive weight on non-driven wheels. That it was so widely used by the rival New York Central would also likely have factored against PRR adoption.

* P5 - mixed-traffic electric locomotive, succeeded by the GG1.

=== Q: 4-4-6-4 or 4-6-4-4 ===

The Q class comprised what were effectively 4-10-4s with the driving axles split into two driven groups. The Q2 was the most powerful non-articulated steam locomotive ever built and also holds the record for highest horsepower recorded by any steam locomotive at 7,987 hp.

* Q1 - experimental duplex freight locomotive.
* Q2 - duplex freight locomotive.

=== R: 4-8-4 ===

The PRR never built any steam locomotives of the 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; type, although the T1 duplexes were effectively a &quot;Northern&quot; with the driving wheels split into two groups.

* R1 - experimental electric locomotive, surpassed by the GG1.

=== S: 6-4-4-6 or 6-8-6 ===

Both S class locomotives were originally intended to only have four leading and trailing wheels, but for the S1 increases in weight required an additional axle at each end. In the case of the S2, it was due to wartime limits on the use of advanced steel alloys.

* S1 - experimental duplex express passenger locomotive.
* S2 - experimental steam turbine locomotive.

=== T: 4-4-4-4 ===

The duplex-drive T1 was the final class of steam locomotive constructed for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and possibly the most controversial.

* T1 - Duplex express passenger locomotive.

=== Compound classifications ===

The PRR classified articulated locomotives and joined locomotive units by using multiples of the previous classifications.

Non-Articulated steam:

* 1320 - 2-2-2-0 locomotive, based on the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Dreadnought Class locomotive. One built.

Articulated steam:

* CC1s - 0-8-8-0 Mallet locomotive. Treated as two 0-8-0s for classification. One built.
* CC2s - 0-8-8-0 Mallet locomotive. 10 built.
* HC1s - 2-8-8-0 simple articulated locomotive. The PRR&#x27;s only main-line articulated. One built.
* HH1s - 2-8-8-2 Mallet locomotive. Treated for classification purposes as two 2-8-0s back to back.
* HH1 - 2-8-8-2 Norfolk &amp; Western class Y3 borrowed by PRR during World War II.

Articulated electric:

* AA1 - experimental 0-4-4-0 or B-B electric locomotives.
* BB1 - two-unit prototype AC electric 0-6-0+0-6-0 switching locomotive, later split into single units as class B1.
* BB2 - two-unit 0-6-0+0-6-0 DC electric switching locomotives, later split into single units as class B1.
* BB3 - two-unit 0-6-0+0-6-0 DC electric switching locomotives for LIRR, later split into single units as class B3.
* DD1 - two-unit DC electric locomotive, two 4-4-0 half-locomotives semi-permanently coupled back to back. Served between Manhattan Transfer and Penn Station, and to Sunnyside Yard.
* DD2 - experimental mixed-traffic AC electric locomotive, similar in overall design and appearance to GG1.
* FF1 - 2-6-6-2 (1-C+C-1) experimental electric locomotive, 1917. Too powerful.
* FF2 - 2-6-6-2 motor-generator AC electric locomotives acquired second-hand from the Great Northern Railway (their classes Y1 and Y1a) in 1956.
* GG1 - express passenger and freight electric locomotive, highly successful.

== Non-standard electric classification ==

* E2b - experimental B-B General Electric-built AC electric locomotives (3 pairs built).
* E3b - experimental B-B-B Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton-Westinghouse AC/DC rectifier locomotives (1 pair built).
* E2c - experimental C-C Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton-Westinghouse AC/DC rectifier locomotives (1 pair built)
* E44 - 1960 C-C General Electric AC/DC rectifier freight locomotives.

The horsepower-based designation unique to the E44 would be retained and expanded by Penn Central to cover the former New Haven EF4s (E33) and EP5s (E40).

==Diesel classification==

The Pennsylvania Railroad was slow to dieselize. By the end of WW2 they only had 18 units. However over the next 22 years they had acquired a total of 3005 units. They bought from all major manufacturers: Alco 516 units, Baldwin 643 units, EMD 1,479 units, Fairbanks-Morse 200 units, General Electric 145 units, and Lima 22 units. This diversity was a nightmare for the maintenance department as there was very little compatibility amongst the different builders. 
::The class number system is as follows:
::The first letter stood for the manufacturer; A=Alco, B =Baldwin, G =General Electric, E =EMD, F =Fairbanks-Morse, and L =Lima.
::The second and third letters represented the type of service; S =switcher, F =Freight, P =passenger, :: PF=dual service, RS =road-switcher, and H =helper.
::The next number(s) were for horse power rounded to hundreds.
::The last letter, if used, was for model variations.

<text>VE (&quot;S&quot;-(diethylamino)ethyl &quot;O&quot;-ethyl ethylphosphonothioate) is a &quot;V-series&quot; nerve agent closely related to the better-known VX nerve agent. It was first reported in 1958 as a pesticide.

Like most of the agents in the V-series (with the exception of VX), VE has not been extensively studied outside of military science.

It is commonly theorized that the so-called &quot;second-generation&quot; V series agents came from a Cold War era Russian chemical weapons development program. They may have been developed sometime between 1950 and 1990. They have similar lethal dose levels to VX (between 10–50 mg) and have similar symptoms and method of action to other nerve agents that act on cholinesterase, and treatment remains the same, but the window for effectively treating second generation V series seizures is shorter. In addition to the standard seizures, some of the second generation V series agents are known to cause comas.

<text>Lewis DuBois (1744 – March 4, 1824) was an American Revolutionary War commander. A descendant of Louis Dubois, who founded the early Huguenot settlement of New Paltz, which is preserved today as Historic Huguenot Street (Huguenot Street Historic District). Before the Revolutionary War, DuBois was a carpenter working in Poughkeepsie, New York.

==Early life==
DuBois is often confused with multiple cousins who share the same name. Louis DuBois was a popular name in the family due to the family&#x27;s patriarch, Louis DuBois (1626-1696), who came to the United States after fleeing religious persecution in France. Lewis was born in early 1744, and baptized on September 9, 1744 in Fishkill, New York. His father, Elias, was born in 1722 in Ulster County, New York, and his mother, Susannah Vanderburgh, born in 1725 in Poughkeepsie, New York. At some point, Lewis&#x27;s father moved from Ulster County to Dutchess County.

Elias&#x27;s father was Louis DuBois (b. 1697), son of Mattheus DuBois (1679-1748) and his wife, Sara Van Keuren DuBois (1678-1748). The father of Mattheus is the aforementioned Louis, first of the DuBois family to the United States. His second cousin, once removed, Colonel Louis J. DuBois (1733-1813), is one of the most common cousins that Lewis is confused with, as they both had nearly identical war records.

His second cousin, James DuBois (1750-1810), is reportedly the great-grandfather of W.E.B. DuBois.

==Military career==
He enlisted in the Provincial Militia in 1762 at the age of 18.

On June 28, 1775, he was commissioned as a Captain and directed to form a Company from Dutchess County to become a part of Colonel James Clinton&#x27;s 3rd New York Regiment in the Canadian Campaign. Within a year of his commission, on June 21, 1776, he was made a full colonel and began raising the 5th New York Regiment. He was taken prisoner at Fort Montgomery October 6, 1777.

Colonel DuBois resigned his commission on December 22, 1779, but by 1780 he was commanding a regiment of New York Levies, fighting in the Mohawk Valley of New York. After the war, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded the Dutchess County Militia from 1787 to 1793.

==Later civilian career==
DuBois was sheriff of Dutchess County from 1781 to 1785, and served in the State Assembly in 1786 and 1787.

On October 23, 1997, the mast, which was property of Cosmos Broadcasting (WLBT a local NBC affiliate), collapsed during the renovation of its guy wires. Three workers were killed. The tower was rebuilt in 1999.

<doc id="1140580" wikidata="Q3964558" url="?curid=1140580" title="Somery">
<text>Somery is a compilation album by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released in 1991 through SST Records. It compiles songs from their &quot;Fat EP&quot; (1981) and the albums &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; (1982), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; (1985), &quot;Enjoy!&quot; (1986), and &quot;All&quot; (1987).

== Background ==
In 1987 SST Records had purchased the Descendents&#x27; previous label New Alliance Records, releasing their 1987 album &quot;All&quot; and re-releasing all of their previous material. Following the Descendents&#x27; final tours in spring and summer 1987, singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—relaunched the band under the name All, releasing three albums on the SST subsidiary Cruz Records between 1988 and 1991 with singers Dave Smalley and Scott Reynolds. SST also released the Descendents live albums &quot;Liveage!&quot; (1987) and &quot;&quot; (1989), both recorded during the final two Descendents tours. &quot;Somery&quot; was released in 1991, compiling tracks from the Descendents&#x27; past studio releases. Stevenson created the cover art for the compilation while Egerton did the graphics. The Descendents would later reunite with Aukerman in 1995 to record &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;.

Stevenson remarked in 1993 that &quot;&quot;Somery&quot; sold more than any of the Descendents albums put together. All the kids are just now getting into it, so that way they can buy one record and kind of get into it and see what it&#x27;s all about, and then if they really like it they can buy all the other records. See, back when we were touring, nobody came to see us. It&#x27;s only now [that] the Descendents have become popular.&quot;

== Reception ==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave &quot;Somery&quot; four and a half stars out of five, saying that although &quot;a handful of great songs from their best albums are missing, &quot;Somery&quot; nevertheless selects the highlights from their occasionally uneven records, making it a useful and comprehensive retrospective.&quot; Erlewine&#x27;s colleague Mike DaRonco called it a felony that &quot;Pep Talk&quot; from &quot;All&quot; was not included on the compilation. Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A− rating, opining that the 1988 compilation &quot;Two Things at Once&quot; contained the band&#x27;s best material, &quot;But anyone beguiled, enthralled, or smacked between the eyes by how nakedly these guys don&#x27;t quite understand their class rage and love-hungry sexual anxiety will hear through their bouts of misogyny and sophomoric humor for the 19 more tuneful if less inspired selections from three later and lesser albums, as in the tortured breakup song/metaphor &#x27;Clean Sheets&#x27; and the fuckup/square&#x27;s confession &#x27;Coolidge&#x27;.&quot; Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Somery&quot; &quot;the only Descendents record to qualify as must-have. It&#x27;s got virtually all of the winning songs, from the goofy hardcore tunes [...] to the more commercial-sounding rockers&quot;.

Tiny contains an artesian well that produces some of the purest spring water in the world. Many residents were concerned that a proposed garbage dump over the aquifer would contaminate the water, and a series of protests achieved a one-year moratorium on the dump.
The dump&#x27;s certificate of approval was later revoked by the province in 2010.

==History==
The township was named in 1822 after a pet dog of Lady Sarah Maitland (1792–1873), wife of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. Two other adjoining townships were also named for her pet dogs, Tay and Flos (now Springwater Township).

Humans have occupied the area now known as Tiny Township for at least 11,000 years. Excavations in what is now Awenda Provincial Park in the 1970s uncovered four archaeological sites dating from the Paleo-Indian period. For much of the Pre-Contact period, the Indigenous peoples of the area would have been hunter-gathers living mostly in small family groupings which would come together in larger groupings during particular times of the year to collect resources such as fish or berries.

Around 1100 C.E., agriculture was introduced to south Central Ontario, with people growing corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and sunflowers. This led to the development of villages centred around longhouses. By 1600 C.E., the five nations of the Huron-Wendat Confederacy had established their villages in the territory they called Wendake, a part of which included what we now call Tiny Township.

Starting in 1615, French Catholic missionaries, first Recollets and then, in 1625, Jesuits, began proselytizing among the Huron-Wendat in what was then called Huronia. The Jesuits built the mission Sainte-Marie among the Hurons and wrote extensively about the Huron-Wendat culture. In 1636, Jesuit missionary Jean de Brebeuf observed and wrote about The Huron Feast of the Dead which occurred at the Huron-Wendat village of Ossossané which was located in what is now Tiny Township.

Diseases brought by the French in this period had a devastating effect on the Huron-Wendat. It is estimated that circa 1600, just prior to European contact, the total population of Wendake was between 20 000 and 25 000 people. However, a series of epidemics between 1634 and 1642 reduced the population to about 9000 people. Attacks by the Haudenosaunee in 1648 and 1649 dispersed the Wendat people, with most traditionalists joining the Haudenosaunee, while others joined with the related, neighbouring Petun people. The remaining Huron-Wendat who followed the missionaries fled to French Territory.

In the 1700s, as the threat from the Haudenosaunee waned, Ojibwe people began to move back into the area. In 1798, the Ojibwe (Chippeway) and the British signed Penetanguishene Bay Purchase turning some of the land which would become Tiny Township over to the British who soon after established a naval base at Penetanguishene. A subsequent treaty in 1815, the Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase turned over the remaining part of the land which would become Tiny Township.

By the mid-19th century, families from Quebec began moving to the Tiny Township area for the cheap and fertile land to farm. The Baldwin Act of 1850 established the Corporation of the United Townships of Tiny and Tay. In 1868, the townships were separated through a Simcoe County by-law.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Tiny had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Services==

The township&#x27;s fire protection services are provided by the Township of Tiny Fire and Emergency Services. The service has a complement of 95 firefighters operating 15 pieces of fire apparatus from five stations located in Lafontaine, Wyevale, North West Basin, Wyebridge and Woodland Beach. The township falls within the jurisdiction of the Ontario Provincial Police and is policed by members of the Southern Georgian Bay and Huronia West detachments.

<text>Pinner is a London Underground station in Pinner, north-west London. The station was opened in 1885 as part of the Victorian expansion of dormitory suburbs, and was one of the stations included in the Metro-land project in the early 20th century. The site is served by several bus routes including links to the Hatch End railway station which was known as Pinner &amp; Hatch End prior to 1920. Step free facilities were opened in 2008. The station is on the Metropolitan line between Northwood Hills and North Harrow stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 5.

Pinner is served by all stations and semi-fast services, one should change at Moor Park for fast service northbound Metropolitan line services. This change is only needed on Mondays-Fridays during peak hours.

==History==

The station was opened on 25 May 1885, following a prior expansion to nearby Harrow-on-the-Hill station in 1880. It remained the terminus of the Metropolitan Railway until 1 September 1887 when the line was further extended to Rickmansworth. The long, single-story station building on the up (southbound) platform is the original building, and resembles the stations at Rickmansworth, Chorleywood and Chalfont &amp; Latimer. The down platform buildings were built during the four-tracking project of the 1950s and 60s in a matching yellow brick.

In 1915, the Metro-land project was conceived in order to move people out of central London into rural Middlesex. Houses near the stations were built in haste and sold for as little as £400 each. However, in Pinner houses built during this expansion were required to be worth at least £1,000 – compared to Harrow-on-the-Hill where prices were subject to a £750 minimum.

The station building on Station Approach is locally listed by the Harrow Council.

==Location==
London bus routes 183, H11, H12 and H13 serve the station&#x27;s location and provide services that terminate at Golders Green, Harrow, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood Hills (St Vincent&#x27;s hospice), Ruislip Lido, South Harrow and Stanmore. The H12 route also connects Pinner tube station to Hatch End railway station, which was named Pinner &amp; Hatch End between 1911 and 1920 before being renamed Hatch End (for Pinner) and then, in 1956, Hatch End. Northwood Hills station is to the north west and North Harrow is to the south east on the Metropolitan line.

Access to the southbound platform is step-free from the ticket hall. In order to reach the northbound platform, during off-peak times, it is necessary to use a footbridge, which was constructed in 2002. Before this, a subway between the two platforms existed, but this was closed for safety reasons. Accessibility lifts opened on 18 July 2008 making the station totally step-free. Originally scheduled for installation in 2005, the delay had been caused by a lack of funding and was originally rescheduled for 2009/10 but following complaints by the Harrow Public Transport Users Association the construction was brought forward to 2007 only to be delayed by the collapse of London Underground contractors Metronet.
During the evening peak there is an extra exit gate on the south end of the Northbound platform which leads out to a small carpark and Pinner Library/Synagogue

==Services==
In the northbound direction, off-peak the station is served by trains to Watford (4tph), Amersham (2tph) and Chesham (2tph) trains (at peak times, &#x27;fast&#x27; trains do not stop at stations between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park). In the southbound direction, off-peak services generally run 4tph to Baker Street and 4tph to Aldgate.

<text>Major-General James Clinton (August 9, 1736 – September 22, 1812) was a Continental Army officer and politician who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

During the war he, along with John Sullivan, led the 1779 Sullivan Expedition against the British-allied Iroquois. The Americans destroyed 40 villages as well as their winter stores of wheat and other produce. This forced 5,000 Iroquois to flee to British controlled Fort Niagara and caused the deaths of several hundred Iroquois during the harsh winter of 1779–1780. He subsequently obtained the rank of brevet major general.

After leaving the army, Clinton was a founding member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati and served as an assemblyman in the New York State legislature and later as a New York State Senator from 1788 to 1792.

==Early life==

Clinton was born in Ulster County in the colony of New York, at Little Britain in the town of New Windsor, now part of Orange County, New York. He was the third son of Col. Charles Clinton, an Anglo-Irish colonist and a colonel in the French and Indian War who immigrated to New Ulster in 1729, and his wife Elizabeth Denniston.

He was the brother of George Clinton, who was elected and served as Governor of New York from 1777 to 1795 and as U.S. Vice President from 1805 to 1812, and the father of DeWitt Clinton, who would also serve as Governor of New York. He was the grandson of James Clinton (d. 1718), and the great-grandson of William Clinton (1614–1684), a Royalist officer in the army of Charles I of England.

==Career==
===French and Indian War===

James Clinton&#x27;s military experience began in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War), where he served in the provincial troops of New York in the British cause. He was commissioned an ensign in 1757 and achieved the rank of captain in the New York Regiment in 1759. Commanding a company in 1758, he participated, along with his father (Colonel) and brother George (Lieutenant), in General John Bradstreet’s capture of Fort Frontenac (now Kingston, Ontario). He and his brother played a key role in capturing a French vessel.

Clinton remained in the army, and was stationed at various frontier posts. In 1763 he raised and commanded a corps of two hundred men, who were designated as &quot;Guards of the Frontier&quot;. After the war, he retired and married Mary De Witt.

===American Revolutionary War===
A month after the first open armed conflict in Lexington, the Continental Congress resolved on May 25, 1775, to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of protecting and maintaining control of the Hudson River. Clinton and Major Christopher Tappen, lifetime residents of the area, were sent to scout appropriate locations. Clinton was commissioned as colonel of the 3rd New York Regiment, which took part in Brig. Gen. Richard Montgomery’s unsuccessful expedition to Quebec in 1775. In March 1776, Clinton took command of the 2nd New York Regiment and soon after, in August, was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army.

He served most of the war in the Northern Department, along the New York frontier. During the Saratoga Campaign in 1777, he commanded Fort Clinton in the Hudson Highlands. He participated in a successful effort to prevent British General Sir Henry Clinton from rescuing General John Burgoyne at Saratoga, but he and his troops were unable to hold Forts Clinton and Montgomery. Clinton sustained a bayonet wound in the leg during the assault. In 1778 he was stationed in Albany to oppose Indian and Tory forces.

In 1779, Clinton led an expedition down the Susquehanna River after making the upper portion navigable by damming up the river&#x27;s source at Otsego Lake, allowing the lake&#x27;s level to rise, and then destroying the dam and flooding the river for miles downstream. This event is described by James Fenimore Cooper in the introduction to his popular novel &quot;The Pioneers&quot; (1823). It is commemorated by an annual Memorial Day canoe race.

At Tioga, New York, Clinton met up with General John Sullivan&#x27;s forces, who had marched from Easton, Pennsylvania. Together, on August 29, they defeated the Tories and British-allied Iroquois at the Battle of Newtown (near today&#x27;s city of Elmira, New York). This became known as the &quot;Sullivan-Clinton Campaign&quot; or the &quot;Sullivan Expedition.&quot; They also attacked Iroquois villages throughout western New York, destroying 40 as well as the winter stores of the people. Around 5,000 Iroquois fled to British controlled Niagara and mortality was high that winter because of starvation with several hundred deaths.

In 1780, Clinton temporarily commanded the Northern Department. By October 1781, his brigade had joined George Washington&#x27;s army in the siege of Yorktown.

===Post-war years===
After leaving he army, Clinton served on the commission defining the New York-Pennsylvania boundary. In 1783 General Clinton became an original member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. He entered state politics, serving as an assemblyman in the New York State legislature from 1787 to 1788 and again from 1800 to 1801, and as a New York State Senator from 1788 to 1792.

==Personal life==
On February 18, 1765, James Clinton married Mary DeWitt (1737–1795), the only daughter of Egbert DeWitt, members of a colonial Dutch family. They had seven children, including:

* Alexander Clinton (1765–1787), who served in Colonel Lamb&#x27;s regiment during the Revolution and drowned in the Hudson River
* Charles Clinton (1767–1829), who married Elizabeth Mulliner (1770–1865)
*DeWitt Clinton (1769–1828), a politician and later governor of New York
*George Clinton, Jr. (1771–1809), politician who served as a U.S. representative in Congress
* Mary Clinton (1773–1808), who married Robert Burrage Norton. After his death, she married Judge Ambrose Spencer (1765–1848).
* Elizabeth Clinton (1776–1832), who married William Stuart
* Katharine Clinton (1778–1837), who married Samuel Lake Norton, brother to her sister Mary&#x27;s husband. After his death, she married Ambrose Spencer, her sister&#x27;s widower.

His second wife was Mary (née Little) Gray (1768–1835), the widow of Alexander Gray (1762–1795), who was born in Ireland. Together, James and Mary were the parents of six children:

* James G. Clinton, who died young.
* Caroline Hannah Clinton (1800–1864), who married Charles Augustus Dewey (1793–1866), an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
* Emma Little Clinton (1802–1823), who never married. 
*James Graham Clinton (1804–1849), who married Margaret Ellsworth Conger and served in Congress.
* Letitia Clinton (1806–1842), who married Dr. Francis Bolton (1804–1849).
* Anna Clinton (1809–1833), who married Lt. Edward Ross.

Clinton died in Little Britain, New York, on September 22, 1812, the same year as his brother George.

===Descendants===
Through his son DeWitt, he was the grandfather of ten, including George William Clinton (1807–1885) who served as Mayor of Buffalo, New York from 1842 to 1843. Through his son George, he was the grandfather of three.

<text>Tridilosa is a very light and resistant, materials-efficient 3-D structure, made from steel and concrete and widely used in civil engineering. Tridilosa was invented by the Mexican engineer Heberto Castillo.

Among the most remarkable features of this structure is that it can save up to 66% on concrete usage and up to 40% on steel, because filling with concrete is not required in the tension zone, only in the superior compression zone. It is so light that it can float on water, but is three times stronger than traditional construction flagstone. It was used, for example, to construct the 54-floor World Trade Center of Mexico City.

<doc id="1140616" wikidata="Q3110725" url="?curid=1140616" title="Tom Gordon">
<text>Thomas Gordon (born November 18, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Flash&quot;, is an American former professional baseball right-handed pitcher and current radio color commentator for the Boston Red Sox. Gordon played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals (1988–1995), Boston Red Sox (1996–1999), Chicago Cubs (2001–02), Houston Astros (2002), Chicago White Sox (2003), New York Yankees (2004–05), Philadelphia Phillies (2006–2008), and Arizona Diamondbacks (2009). In 1998, he won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and led the American League (AL) in saves and games finished. In 1998–99, Gordon set a then-MLB record with 54 consecutive saves.

==Early life==
Gordon was one of several children born to Annie and Thomas Gordon. He was raised in abject poverty and his parents could not afford a telephone. Gordon attended Avon Park High School in Avon Park, Florida, and was a letterman in baseball. He was selected in the sixth round of the 1986 MLB Draft by the Kansas City Royals. He received a $38,000 signing bonus.

== Professional career ==
=== Kansas City Royals (1988–1995) ===
Gordon began his career as a starting pitcher with the Kansas City Royals, first appearing in five games at the age of 20 late in the 1988 season. He became an immediate sensation in Kansas City the following year, posting a 17–9 record and a 3.64 ERA in his first full season, finishing second in the 1989 Rookie of the Year balloting. Gordon also recorded 153 strikeouts that year, the tenth highest total in the American League, which earned him the nickname &quot;Flash.&quot;

Gordon continued to post top-10 strikeout totals during the 1990 and 1991 seasons, but his number of wins dropped each year and his ERA crept upwards. Finally, in 1992, Gordon had one of the worst season of his career, posting a 6–10 record and a 4.59 ERA. He bounced back with seasons of 11 to 12 wins from 1993 to 1995, but he never quite regained his rookie form. Prior to the 1996 season, Gordon left Kansas City and signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox.

=== Boston Red Sox (1996–1999) ===
In his first season in Boston, Gordon had a 12–9 record and a 5.59 ERA – the highest ERA of his career to that point. Over the next two years, however, the Red Sox converted Gordon from a starting pitcher to a closer and his career reignited. In 1998, Gordon set the club&#x27;s single-season record for saves (46), with 43 of them in a row, and was named to his first All-Star Team. His success continued in 1999 setting a major league record with his 54th consecutive save in June, but an ongoing elbow injury limited him to just 21 appearances, which required ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (or UCL) also known as Tommy John surgery, that forced him to spend all of 2000 on the disabled list. His popularity in Boston at this point led New England–based writer and Red Sox fan Stephen King to reference him as the object of infatuation for the young protagonist of the 1999 novel &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;.

=== Chicago Cubs (2001–2002) ===
The Chicago Cubs, who were in the process of massively overhauling their pitching staff, signed Gordon to a two-year, $5 million contract on December 15, 2000.

=== Houston Astros (2002) ===
On August 22, 2002, the Cubs, who had little interest in retaining Gordon as a closer after obtaining Antonio Alfonseca at the end of spring training, traded him to the Houston Astros in exchange for pitching prospect Russ Rohlicek and two players to be named later, later named as Travis Anderson and Mike Nannini. He was blocked from closing on his new team by bullpen staple Billy Wagner, as well as by setup man Octavio Dotel, but Gordon found his position as a middle reliever for Houston. After going 1–3 with a 3.02 ERA in 33 appearances between Chicago and Houston, Gordon&#x27;s family sent him a bouquet to celebrate that he had closed the season in full health for the first time since 1999.

=== Chicago White Sox (2003) ===
Gordon, a free agent after the 2002 season, signed a one-year, $1.4 million contract with the Chicago White Sox on January 21, 2003. His first win with the team came on April 16, when he pitched the last two innings of a 4–3 comeback win over his former team, the Royals. Gordon and Damaso Marte were the only consistent bullpen presences for the White Sox, and in an attempt to keep the two pitchers healthy for the final stretch of the regular season, manager Jerry Manuel was forced to call up Billy Koch and Jose Paniagua from the minor leagues. That September, Éric Gagné of the Los Angeles Dodgers broke Gordon&#x27;s consecutive save record with his 55th in a row. Gordon, who was among the best in the AL that year in strikeouts, home runs per nine innings, and wins, was not offended by the feat, telling reporters, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know whose save record I broke, so I don&#x27;t have any feelings about that.&quot; Gordon went 7–6 with a 3.16 ERA in 66 appearances and 74 innings, during which he converted 12 saves in 17 opportunities, struck out 91 batters, and allowed only 0.5 home runs per nine innings.

=== New York Yankees (2004–2005) ===
After subsequent stops in Houston and both sides of Chicago, Gordon landed in New York. He was an invaluable addition to the Yankees bullpen, serving as a set-up for closer Mariano Rivera, or as a middle reliever in tough situations.

At this point, Gordon had compiled a career 122–111 record with 1733 strikeouts, a 3.99 ERA, 114 saves, and 1,896.2 innings in 671 games (203 as a starter).

=== Philadelphia Phillies (2006–2008) ===
He signed a three-year deal worth $18 million with the Phillies before the 2006 season. Gordon debuted in Philadelphia as a closer during the 2006 season, replacing Billy Wagner, who signed with the Mets after the 2005 season. On May 2, 2007, Gordon was placed on the disabled list due to a rotator cuff inflammation, at which time he was replaced in the closer slot by former starting pitcher Brett Myers. Following both pitchers&#x27; return from the DL, Myers retained the closer position, while Gordon was shifted to a late-inning reliever. Flash was named to the 2006 NL All Star Team as the leading vote getter from the players.

Gordon had fully rehabilitated his arm and was prepared for the &#x27;08 season.

However, on July 6, 2008, Gordon was placed on the 15-day disabled list for tenderness in his right elbow. Fellow reliever Brad Lidge praised Gordon calling him &quot;a stud&quot; and said that the Phils were hoping for him to return to the team after his 15-day stint. Prior to being placed on the disabled list, Gordon recorded a 13.45 earned run average giving up six runs in four total innings since June 11. He eventually was ruled out for the season, but was able to earn his only World Series ring on the bench in the 2008 World Series.

=== Arizona Diamondbacks (2009) ===
On February 6, 2009, Gordon agreed to a one-year, $500,000 contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks, with additional bonuses up to $2.5 million based on how much time he spent on the active roster. Before agreeing to the deal, Gordon spoke to the Phillies about the opportunity to move west. He began the season on the disabled list to finish his elbow recovery, and on May 3, only a week after being reactivated, Gordon injured his hamstring while trying to tag Rickie Weeks at the plate. He remained prone on the field for several minutes and had to be carried away. He had made only three appearances for the team, going 0–1 in the process. On August 12, the Diamondbacks released Gordon, who had allowed 10 earned runs in one game of a Triple-A rehab assignment in Reno. Gordon was reluctant to retire after his release, saying, &quot;I still feel I can play the game I love ... I still want to pitch in a World Series.&quot;

=== Retirement ===
On August 9, 2010, Gordon said that he still thinks he has what it takes to compete, but that he&#x27;s &quot;fine&quot; with retirement.

He retired as the only pitcher in MLB history to have over 100 wins, over 100 saves, and over 100 holds.

==Career highlights and achievements==
*Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award (1998)
*Led AL in saves (1998)

==Family==
Gordon has five children with four different women, none of whom he married. He is the father of Tamasha, Devaris (Dee), Thomas, Thomana, and Nicholas (Nick).

His oldest son, Dee, most recently played for the Washington Nationals. His youngest son, Nick, was drafted fifth overall by the Minnesota Twins in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft and joined the Twins’ major league squad in 2021.

Gordon is the guardian of Cleveland Guardians minor league pitcher Juan Hillman.

One of Gordon&#x27;s brothers, Anthony Gordon and his cousin Clyde &quot;Pork Chop&quot; Pough, played professional baseball. Anthony was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 26th round of the 1987 draft and played 7 minor league seasons. Pough was drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Indians a year later and played seven seasons in MiLB followed by one season in the Mexican League and five in the Atlantic League.

==In popular culture==
Gordon is mentioned by name in the title, and frequently referred to in the Stephen King novel &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.&quot;

<doc id="1140646" wikidata="Q2033977" url="?curid=1140646" title="Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)">
<text>The Citizens&#x27; Action Party (; commonly abbreviated as PAC) is a political party in Costa Rica.

Its platform is based on encouraging citizen participation and involvement in politics. One of its guiding ideals is to fight against corruption, arguing that it is one of the main causes of underdevelopment and voter apathy. The party took a leading role in the failed campaign against Costa Rica&#x27;s membership of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

==History and elections==

===Founding and 2002 election===

PAC was founded in December 2000 by several dissidents from Costa Rica&#x27;s two traditional parties, the National Liberation Party and the Social Christian Unity Party. Originally an anti-corruption party, it startled the Costa Rican political arena with a very strong showing in the 2002 general elections. In the presidential vote, party founder and candidate Ottón Solís was able to secure 26% of the votes – an unprecedented amount for a third party in Costa Rica – and force a runoff between the PLN and PUSC.

The party won 21.9% of the popular vote and 14 out of 57 seats in the Legislative Assembly, making it the third strongest political force in the legislature. A few months later, however, after a series of internal disputes, six of the party&#x27;s 14 deputies resigned from the party, leaving PAC with only eight seats.

===2006 election===

In the February 5, 2006 parliamentary election, the party won 17 out of 57 seats. Ottón Solís ran for president again, losing to the PLN&#x27;s Oscar Arias Sanchez by less than 2% of the votes. Arias only won by a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff. The number of spoiled ballots was larger than the margin between Solís and Arias.

After the 2006 election, Ótton Solís took a year away from politics to teach in the United States. Former PLN Secretary General Luis Guillermo Solís&#x27; name began being circulated at meetings of the &quot;ungroup,&quot; an informal gathering of PAC officials, led by former deputy Alberto Salom. Several PAC officials wanted Luis Guillermo Solís to run as a deputy in San José and as a vice presidential candidate in 2010.

Future President Luis Guillermo Solís joined the party in 2009. and attended meetings of the &quot;ungroup&quot; shortly thereafter in anticipation of the 2014 election.

===2010 election===

In the 2010 election, Ottón Solís ran for his third and final time as president. Laura Chinchilla of the PLN won, but Ottón Solís finished with 25.2% of the votes. PAC won the second fraction in the Legislative Assembly with 11 deputies elected. Six candidates won municipal elections in the rural communities of Aserrí, Matina, Hojancha, Cañas, Los Chiles y Guatuso.

===2014 election===
In 2013, PAC held its second national convention. It was an open convention in which any citizen could vote, despite party affiliation. Four candidates vied for the primary to represent PAC in the 2014 national elections: Epsy Campbell Barr, Juan Carlos Mendoza, Luis Guillermo Solís, and Ronald Solís Bolaños, with Luis Guillermo Solís winning 35% of the votes.

On 6 April 2014, Luis Guillermo Solís became the president elect of Costa Rica. PAC candidates won 13 seats in the Legislative Assembly.

===2018 election===
The third national convention was held between only two candidates, both former ministers on PAC&#x27;s first cabinet; Minister of Economy Welmer Ramos and Minister of Labor Carlos Alvarado. Ramos was an economist, more socially conservative and close to the &quot;ottonista&quot; faction, whilst Alvarado was writer and political scientist, much more socially liberal and younger, close to the &quot;progresista&quot; faction. Alvarado won the primary election becoming PAC&#x27;s first time candidate during government.

Despite suffering from a diminished popularity due to the &quot;Cementazo&quot; scandal affecting the image of Luis Guillermo Solis&#x27; government, Alvarado&#x27;s progressive positions boost him into the second round as a counter-reaction after the growth of Evangelical Christian singer and ultra-conservative candidate Fabricio Alvarado after the backlash against the IACHR&#x27;s ruling ordering the country to legalize same-sex marriage, winning by a wide margin in the second round with 60% of the votes and more than 1,300,000 votes over the 39% and around 800,000 votes of his rival, becoming the second time that the party achieved more than a million votes in second round.

==Platform==
While cleaning up corruption has been one of PAC&#x27;s main goals since its creation, Solís has added to the party&#x27;s platform. He wants to build infrastructure, bolster Costa Rica&#x27;s universal health care and social security systems and push for environmentally friendly policies. Historically, PAC has opposed free trade agreements such as CAFTA, which Solís claims is improperly implemented. In addition, PAC claims that the country&#x27;s tax system is inadequate, saying that a more progressive system is needed.

===International relations===
PAC is a member of the Progressive Alliance. It maintains informal relations with other progressive and social democratic parties. Ottón Solís has independently met with Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist Party of Chile during a visit to Costa Rica, Cristina Fernández, and members of the Democratic Party of the United States.

== Controversies ==

=== Estafa cases ===
The party was affected in 2016 by a conviction for irregular handling of funds when treasurer Maynor Sterling and an official of the headquarters named Bolaños were found guilty of trying to collect from the Supreme Elections Court for goods and services donated by adherents of the party. The conviction carried a fine of 500 million colones and jail terms for the two involved. In December 2020, the PAC resorts to requesting donations to pay the debt for fraud to the State.

<doc id="1140651" wikidata="Q2321891" url="?curid=1140651" title="Palacio de Lecumberri">
<text>The Palacio de Lecumberri is a large building, formerly a prison, in the northeast of Mexico City, Mexico, which now houses the General National Archive (&quot;Archivo General de la Nación&quot;).
Known in popular culture as &quot;The Black Palace of Lecumberri&quot;, it served as a penitentiary from 1900 to 1976. It was inaugurated by President Porfirio Díaz. The building was decommissioned as a prison in 1976 and turned over to the country&#x27;s National Archive in 1980. 

==Location, design and use==

Palacio de Lecumberri is located at the North East border of Mexico City&#x27;s Federal District. The building was used as a prison from 1900–1976, and as the Country&#x27;s National Archive from 1980 onwards.

The prison was mainly constructed to contain major political advisers of the opposing side, or other criminals to the nation from the time of operation. Construction began in 1888.
The inspiration and design of the Palacio is by Miguel S. Macedo, who was later imprisoned there for several months during the Mexican Revolution. The design is said to have been based on that of Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s Panopticon.
This design allows for a single guard to observe all the prisoners without them being able to tell when the guard is looking; they therefore act as though they are always being watched.

The prison was built to hold 800 men, 180 women and 400 children. It had 804 cells, workshops,
a nursery, cooking and baking workshops. There was also an area of government, a section dedicated to medical and waiting rooms.

==Living conditions==

The &quot;Diary of Lecumberri&quot; by Colombian Poet Álvaro Mutis, describes his time thereafter being imprisoned in 1958. The living conditions within the prison were very dangerous due to the inmates&#x27; treatment
by the guards or staff. Torture and beatings were common. Corruption was also present within the prison system.

==Inmates==

The majority of the early inmates were political threats to Porfirio Díaz and his administration. During the Mexico 68 student protests and the Dirty War of the 1970s it held left wing political prisoners.

There were a few notable people imprisoned there over the years including: David Alfaro Siqueiros, Juan Gabriel, Roberto &quot;Anulfo&quot; Villegas, Heberto Castillo, Trotsky&#x27;s murderer Ramón Mercader, Gregorio Cárdenas Hernández and José Revueltas.

During &quot;La decena trágica&quot; in 1913, President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President José María Pino Suárez were murdered while en route to Lecumberri.

Throughout its 76-year use as a prison, only two people escaped alive. The first, Pancho Villa, was a general of the Mexican Revolution who made his escape in 1912. The second was Dwight Worker, an American convicted of smuggling cocaine. With the aid of his then-wife, Worker escaped on December 17, 1975, disguised as a woman. They later authored a book about their experiences entitled &quot;Escape&quot; ().

==National Archives ==

The &quot;Archivo General de la Nación&quot; (General Archive of the Nation) is charged by the Mexican state to
&quot;be the governing body of the national archives and the central consultative entity of the Federal Executive.&quot; The writer Edmundo O&#x27;Gorman was its general director from 1938 until 1952. It is considered the most important among its class in the Americas and one of the most important in the entire world. In November 1976 the Prison was decommissioned on the order of President Luis Echeverría and turned over to the National Archive in 1980.

The archive houses millions of pages of the country’s documentary heritage. Former prison cells are now used as record repositories and the corridors between them are used as galleries in which researchers can sit and read. In June 2002, 60,000 secret police files held within the archives were opened to the public by President Vicente Fox. The files document the government&#x27;s actions during the Dirty War.

<doc id="1140654" wikidata="Q2220861" url="?curid=1140654" title="Dirt cone">
<text>A dirt cone is a type of depositional glacial feature. Dirt cones are not actually made entirely of dirt. They have a core of ice, snow, or firn that gets covered with material and insulated. The material, if it is thick enough, will protect the underlying core from ablation. The thickness of material needed to insulate the core is called the “critical thickness.” If the material is less thick than the critical thickness, it will actually speed up erosion of the core through ablation. This is called “indirect ablation.” The cone would then begin melting and shrinking away.

== Formation ==
Dirt cones begin forming in a crevasse or a hollow. Dirt, dust, or moraine deposit material will fall into the crevasse in the glacier and build up over time. At the same time, the surrounding glacier lowers through ablation until the dirt filled crevasse is exposed and the material begins to spread out of top of the glacier. The rest of the glacier continues to lower as the material mound grows higher and taller. Any ice, snow, or firn trapped under the material will be insulated and protected from erosion. It begins forming a conical shape as the sides steepen to an angle that is unstable. Material falls down and protects the sides. The more material is added to the top, the more insulated the core becomes. Over time, it becomes a cone with a layer of material on the outside and a core of ice, snow, or firn on the inside. The material at the top of the cone is generally thicker than the material on the sides of the dirt cone.

Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.Even areas with a very small debris load, like Antarctica, can have dirt cones. The dirt cones in Antarctica are formed from the moraine deposit material left behind when a glacier retreats. The material making up these cones can be sorted or unsorted. Sorted moraine material is sorted by water. Sorting refers to the material size. Well-sorted material is all the same size. Unsorted material consists of all different sizes. For instance, there are smaller grained particles, like clay aggregates, next to boulders and gravel. Both sorted and unsorted moraine material is used in Antarctica to make dirt cones. Dirt cones were previously not thought to be formed in Antarctica.

Some cones are only a few centimeters tall, while others can be up to 30 meters high. The larger dirt cones are commonly multiple cones that have fused (melted) together. As an ice sheet or glacier melts and retreats, the cones on the surface are brought together and eventually fuse together. This strengthens the ice core and creates a thicker layer of material on the outside to protect the hardened core from eroding. They can develop in one winter season or they can be a product of several seasons. Sometimes, they form as a single cone or as multiple cones in a ridge on moraine deposits. Generally, there are many cones on a glacier, snow patch, or ice sheet. They may be similar in size and material.

Dirt cones are found all over the globe, in both arctic and temperate regions. They are not limited to one geographic region. They have been seen in Iceland, Alaska, Antarctica, in the Himalayas, Norway, Canada, and Greenland. Many of these cones have been studied and surveyed to better understand their dynamics. All they need to form is debris of some sort and ice.

<doc id="1140663" wikidata="Q3058798" url="?curid=1140663" title="Whipple shield">
<text>The Whipple shield or Whipple bumper, invented by Fred Whipple, is a type of spaced armor shielding to protect crewed and uncrewed spacecraft from hypervelocity impact / collisions with micrometeoroids and orbital debris whose velocities generally range between . According to NASA, the Whipple shield is designed to withstand collisions with debris up to 1 cm.

==Shield==
In contrast to monolithic shielding of early spacecraft, Whipple shields consist of a relatively thin outer bumper spaced some distance from the main spacecraft wall. The bumper is not expected to stop the incoming particle or even remove much of its energy, but to break up and disperse it, dividing the original particle energy among many fragments that fan out between bumper and wall. The original particle energy is spread more thinly over a larger wall area, which is more likely to withstand it. Although a Whipple shield lowers total spacecraft mass compared to a solid shield (always desirable in spaceflight), the extra enclosed volume may require a larger payload fairing.

There are several variations on the simple Whipple shield. Multi-shock shields, like the one used on the &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft, use multiple bumpers spaced apart to increase the shield&#x27;s ability to protect the spacecraft. Whipple shields that have a filling between the rigid layers of the shield are called &quot;stuffed Whipple shields&quot;. The filling in these shields is usually a high-strength material like Kevlar or Nextel aluminium oxide fiber. The type of shield, the material, thickness and distance between layers are varied to produce a shield with minimal mass that will also minimize the probability of penetration. There are over 100 shield configurations on the International Space Station alone, with important and high-risk areas having better shielding.

<doc id="1140669" wikidata="Q3309124" url="?curid=1140669" title="Postum">
<text>Postum () is a powdered roasted grain beverage popular as a coffee substitute. The caffeine-free beverage was created by Post Cereal Company founder C. W. Post in 1895 and marketed as a healthier alternative to coffee. Post was a student of John Harvey Kellogg, who believed that caffeine was unhealthy. Post Cereal Company eventually became General Foods, then merged to Kraft Foods Inc. in 1990. Eliza&#x27;s Quest Foods now owns the trademark rights and secret recipe of Postum.

The &quot;instant&quot; drink mix version was developed in 1912, replacing the original brewed beverage. Postum is made from roasted wheat bran and molasses. In addition to the original flavor, coffee-flavored and cocoa-flavored versions have been introduced.

==Acrylamide==
When tested by the FDA, Postum had more acrylamide than any other product, by dry weight.

==History==
Postum quickly became popular, making Post wealthy. The aggressive advertising, with the slogan &quot;There&#x27;s a Reason&quot;, warned against the alleged dangers of coffee and caffeine, and promoted the benefits of Postum. When imitations appeared, the company introduced a cheaper drink called Monk&#x27;s Brew that was identical to Postum, but discontinued it after competitors left the market. Instant Postum appeared in 1911. A 1912 advertisement for Instant Postum is the earliest known use of the word &quot;instant&quot; to refer to a processed food that can be prepared immediately.

Although the Post Cereal Company explicitly stated in its advertising that Postum did not taste like coffee and was not a coffee substitute, the drink enjoyed an enormous rise in sales and popularity in the United States during World War II when coffee was rationed and people sought a replacement.

Postum was sometimes marketed by a cartoon ghost named Mr. Coffee-Nerves, who would appear in situations wherein people were shown in uncomfortable life situations (e.g., irritability, lack of sleep, lack of athletic prowess) due to their use of coffee and its negative effects. These cartoons always ended with the afflicted people switching to Postum and Mr. Coffee-Nerves fleeing until the next cartoon. The company sponsored the radio shows &quot;Lum and Abner&quot;, &quot;Beulah&quot; and &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot;, and the radio version of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;.

Postum was popular with members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and part of Mormon culture for many years because Mormons abstain from coffee. It was also popular with those following religious dietary restrictions of Seventh-day Adventists.

The US government used Postum as a code name for polonium, used in the Urchin-style nuclear weapon initiators.

Kraft discontinued production of Postum in 2007. In May 2012, Kraft sold the Postum trademark and trade secret to Eliza&#x27;s Quest Food, with Postum sold through Postum.com. As of January 2013, Eliza&#x27;s Quest Food succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;All by Herself&quot;, episode 14, season 5 of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, Mrs. Garrett offers the girls a nice, piping hot cup of Postum.

In &quot;The Pez Dispenser&quot;, episode 14, season 3 of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, George and Jerry briefly discuss how Postum is underrated as a drink.

In “Homer the Smithers”, episode 17, season 7 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Homer becomes Mr. Burns’ assistant. In a montage of Homer’s ineptitude on the job, Mr. Burns throws a drink in Homer’s face, shouting: “You call this Postum?!”

<doc id="1140678" wikidata="Q441205" url="?curid=1140678" title="Cuffy (slave)">
<text>Cuffy, also known as Kofi Badu, also spelled as Coffij, Coffy, Cuffy, Kofi, or Koffi (died in 1763), was an African Akan man who was captured in West Africa and stolen for slavery to work on the plantations of the Dutch colony of Berbice in present-day Guyana. In 1763, he led a major slave revolt of around 5,000 slaves against the Dutch. The slave revolt was eventually suppressed and Coffij committed suicide. Today, he is a national hero in Guyana.

== Early life ==
Cuffy was born in the 18th-century in what is now southern Ghana. At some point he was captured into slavery and sent across the ocean as part of the Atlantic slave trade. He was sent to Guyana, where he and many other African slaves were made to work on Dutch plantations.

== Berbice Rebellion ==

Cuffy lived in Lilienburg, a plantation on the Berbice River, as a house-slave for a cooper (barrel maker). He was owned by the widow Berkey. On 23 February 1763, slaves on plantation Magdalenenberg on the Canje River rebelled, protesting harsh and inhumane treatment. They torched the plantation house, and made for the Courantyne River where Caribs and troops commanded by Governor of Suriname attacked, and killed them. On 27 February 1763, a revolt took place on the Hollandia plantation next to Lilienburg. Cuffy is said to have organized the slaves into a military unit, after which the revolt spread to neighbouring plantations. When Dutch Governor Wolfert Simon Van Hoogenheim sent military assistance to the region, the rebellion had reached the Berbice River and was moving steadily towards the Berbice capital, Fort Nassau. They took gunpowder and guns from the attacked plantations.

By 3 March, the rebels were 600 in number. Led by Cossala, they tried to take the brick house of Peerenboom. They agreed to allow the whites to leave the brick house, but as soon they left, the rebels killed many and took several prisoners, among them Sara George, the 19-year-old daughter of the Peerenboom Plantation owner, whom Cuffy kept as his wife.

Cuffy was soon accepted by the rebels as their leader and declared himself Governor of Berbice. Doing so he named Captain Accara as his deputy in charge of military affairs, and tried to establish discipline over the troops. Accara was skilful in military discipline. They organized the farms in order to provide food supplies.

== Defeat of the rebellion ==

Wolfert Simon van Hoogenheim committed himself to retake the colony. Accara attacked the whites three times without permission from Cuffy, and eventually the colonists were driven back. Thus began a dispute among the two rebels. On 2 April 1763, Cuffy wrote to Van Hoogenheim saying that he did not want a war against the whites and proposed a partition of Berbice with the whites occupying the coastal areas and the blacks the interior. Van Hoogenheim delayed his decision replying that the Society of Berbice in Amsterdam had to make that decision and that it would take three to four months. He was waiting for support from neighboring colonies; a ship from Suriname had already arrived, and reinforcements from Barbados and Sint Eustatius soon followed. Cuffy then ordered his forces to attack the whites in May 1763, but in so doing had many losses. The defeat opened a division among the rebels and weakened their organization. Accara became the leader of a new faction opposed to Cuffy and led to a civil war among themselves. On 19 October 1763, it was reported to the governor that Captains Atta had revolted against Cuffy , and that Cuffy had committed suicide. In the meantime, the colonists had already been strengthened by the arrival of soldiers. On 15 April 1764 Captain Accabre, the last of the insurgents, was captured.

== National hero ==
The anniversary of the Berbice Rebellion, 23 February, has been Republic Day in Guyana since 1970. Cuffy is commemorated in the 1763 Monument in the Square of the Revolution in the capital Georgetown.

This statue is called the 1763 Monument or the Cuffy Monument. The statue was designed by the Guyanese sculptor Philip Moore. It stands at 15 feet tall and weighs two and a half tons.  

The figure of Cuffy standing on top has many symbols. His pouting mouth symbolizes his defiance, the face on his chest forms a symbolic breastplate that gives protection during battle, and the honed faces on his thighs represent revolutionaries from Guyanese history. He holds in his hands a dog and a pig, both being throttled with the dog representing covetousness and greed while the pig represents ignorance.

<text>The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 is a 12-volume series covering Australian involvement in the First World War. The series was edited by C. E. W. Bean, who also wrote six of the volumes and was published between 1920 and 1942. The first seven volumes deal with the Australian Imperial Force while other volumes deal with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force at Rabaul, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Flying Corps and the home front; the final volume is a photographic record.

Unlike other official histories which have been aimed at military staff, Bean intended the Australian history to be accessible to a non-military audience. The relatively small size of the Australian forces, enabled the history to be presented in great detail, giving accounts of individual actions that would not have been possible when covering a larger force. Bean devoted over to the Battle of Fromelles, a relatively small action intended as a diversion during the Battle of the Somme, which lasted one night and involved the 5th Australian Division. Fromelles was also the first time that the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) saw action on the Western Front and was very costly for the Australians, with 5,533 men killed, wounded or captured.

== Volumes ==

* &quot;Volume I – The Story of Anzac: the first phase&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1921
* &quot;Volume II – The Story of Anzac: from 4 May, 1915 to the evacuation&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1924
* &quot;Volume III – The Australian Imperial Force in France: 1916&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1929
* &quot;Volume IV – The Australian Imperial Force in France: 1917&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1933
* &quot;Volume V – The Australian Imperial Force in France: December 1917 – May 1918&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1937
* &quot;Volume VI – The Australian Imperial Force in France: May 1918 – the Armistice&quot;, C.E.W Bean, 1942
* &quot;Volume VII – The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine: 1914 – 1918&quot;, H.S. Gullett, 1923
* &quot;Volume VIII – The Australian Flying Corps: 1914 – 1918&quot;, Frederic Morley Cutlack, 1923
* &quot;Volume IX – The Royal Australian Navy: 1914 – 1918&quot;, Arthur W. Jose, 1928
* &quot;Volume X – The Australians at Rabaul&quot;, Seaforth Simpson Mackenzie, 1927
* &quot;Volume XI – Australia During the War&quot;, Ernest Scott, 1936
* &quot;Volume XII – Photographic Record of the War&quot;

== Other volumes ==
The three volumes of the Official History of the Australian Army Medical Services, 1914–1918, mostly written by Arthur Butler, are also considered by the Australian War Memorial to be Volumes XIII, XIV &amp; XV of the Official History.
* &quot;Volume I – Gallipoli, Palestine and New Guinea (2nd edition, 1938)&quot; first published 1930
* &quot;Volume II – The Western Front (1st edition, 1940)&quot;
* &quot;Volume III – Special Problems and Services (1st edition, 1943)&quot;

Following the publication of the final volume, Bean compiled &quot;Anzac to Amiens&quot;, a condensed history in one volume aimed at the general public, which was published in 1946. This was followed in 1948 by &quot;Gallipoli Mission&quot; which detailed how he and his team had researched what had happened in Gallipoli.

<text>A stinger is a duo cocktail made by adding crème de menthe to brandy (although recipes vary). The cocktail&#x27;s origins can be traced to the United States in the 1890s, and the beverage remained widely popular in America until the 1970s. It was seen as a drink of the upper class, and has had a somewhat wide cultural impact.

==History of the cocktail==
The stinger originated about 1890. The cocktail may have been derived from The Judge, a cocktail made with brandy, crème de menthe, and simple syrup found in William Schmidt&#x27;s 1892 cocktail book &quot;The Flowing Bowl&quot;. It was immediately popular in New York City, and quickly became known as a &quot;society&quot; drink (i.e. only for the upper classes). According to bartender Jere Sullivan in his 1930 volume &quot;The Drinks of Yesteryear: A Mixology&quot;, the stinger remained a critical component of the bartender&#x27;s repertoire until Prohibition.

The stinger was not initially seen as a cocktail (i.e. a drink served before dinner), but rather a digestif (after-dinner drink). Writing in the 1910s and 1920s, humorist Don Marquis&#x27;s &quot;Hermione&quot; (a fictional daffy society do-gooder) refused to refer to the stinger as a cocktail, indicating its status in upper-class society. Over time, however, the stinger came to be consumed like a cocktail.

The stinger was a popular drink during Prohibition in the United States, for crème de menthe could mask the taste of the inferior-quality brandies then available. The stinger began to lose favor with Americans in the late 1970s, and was not a well-known cocktail in the early 21st century.

==Recipe==
The stinger is a duo cocktail, in that it uses only two ingredients: a spirit and a liqueur. The classic stinger recipe uses three parts brandy and one part white crème de menthe. However, stinger recipes vary, and some recipes call for equal parts brandy and crème de menthe. The mixture was originally stirred, although modern recipes call for it to be shaken with cracked ice. Early recipes required that a stinger be served straight up, but since the end of Prohibition in the United States it became more common for it to be served over crushed ice.

Cognac, a type of brandy, was identified as the basis for the stinger as early as 1905 in William &quot;Cocktail&quot; Boothby&#x27;s supplement to his 1900 book, &quot;American Bar-Tender&quot;. In the 21st century, cognac is the most commonly used brandy cited by recipes for the stinger&#x27;s base liquor.

Cocktail guides recommend that it be served in a cocktail glass if served straight, or in a rocks glass if served with ice.

===Variations===
The amaretto stinger uses a 3-to-1 ratio of amaretto to white crème de menthe, while an Irish stinger uses equal parts Irish cream liqueur and white crème de menthe.

The Mexican stinger substitutes tequila for brandy.

A &quot;vodka stinger&quot;, also known as a white spider, uses vodka instead of brandy.

The white way cocktail, which celebrates Broadway theatre, is a stinger made with gin rather than brandy.

Mixologists Oliver Said and James Mellgren cite a cocktail known as the stinger sour. It is made with a 3-to-1-to-1 ratio of bourbon, peppermint schnapps, and lemon juice. This cocktail is not technically a stinger, since it omits the crème de menthe.

==Cultural impact==
The stinger&#x27;s popularity in New York City was so great that urban legends attributed the cocktail&#x27;s genesis to famous millionaire Reginald Vanderbilt. It was further claimed that the stinger was Vanderbilt&#x27;s favorite cocktail, and he spent hours making them for his guests. He would shake them up for himself and friends in his barroom, always with a dash of absinthe added. But Vanderbilt did not call this drink the Brant or the Bartholdi—he called it the Stinger.

The stinger&#x27;s reputation as a high-society drink led to its appearance in several famous novels. James Bond and Tiffany Case each have a stinger in the 1956 Ian Fleming novel &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot;. The spy Alec Leamas drinks stingers in John le Carré&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;.

The vodka stinger was the drink of choice for Joanne in the musical &quot;Company&quot; by Stephen Sondheim, with her calling for one in the song &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot;.

The drink is also featured in the 2007 &quot;Mad Men&quot; season one episode &quot;Nixon v. Kennedy&quot;, set in 1960. The episode features stingers made with Bacardi rum, as Bacardi was a series sponsor.

Women in Lawrence Block novels sometimes drink stingers. In &quot;The Burglar Who Dropped In On Elvis&quot; Bernie&#x27;s date &quot;had two dry Rob Roys first, most of the dinner wine, and a stinger afterward. I had a Bloody Mary for openers, and my after-dinner drink was a cup of coffee. I felt like a cheap date.&quot; And in &quot;The Burglar in the Closet&quot;, &quot;Frankie&#x27;s drinking, on the other hand, was certainly serious enough to keep the Recovery Room anchored in grim reality. A stinger is always a reasonably serious proposition. A brace of stingers at four o&#x27;clock on a weekday afternoon is about as serious as you can get.&quot;

The stinger was widely mentioned in American motion pictures. Dudley the angel (played by Cary Grant) orders a round of stingers while lunching with ladies from the church in the 1947 film &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The evolving stinger (used with green rather than white crème de menthe) forms a plot point in the 1948 film &quot;The Big Clock&quot;, when George Stroud (Ray Milland) orders one and a random woman in the bar (Rita Johnson) already knows his name. In the 1950 Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame film &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, Dix Steele&#x27;s lush friend Charlie orders a stinger at Paul&#x27;s bar before the first fight scene. In the 1956 Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra film &quot;High Society&quot;, Dexter-Haven&#x27;s butler offers Stingers at lunch to those who over-indulged in champagne during the previous evening&#x27;s party. Cary Grant again orders stingers (&quot;and keep them coming&quot;) as he tries to tolerate character Alice Kratzner&#x27;s (Jayne Mansfield) empty-headed babbling in the 1957 comedy film &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;. Mr. Dobitsch (Ray Walston) instructs his Marilyn Monroe look-alike date (Joyce Jameson) in the 1960 film &quot;The Apartment&quot; to not spill the glasses of stingers she is holding as they exit their cab and enter C.C. Baxter&#x27;s (Jack Lemmon) apartment at night for a tryst. In the 1975 Warren Beatty film &quot;Shampoo&quot;, at the Republican Party dinner scene Goldie Hawn says, &quot;I&#x27;ll have a stinger&quot;, to which Tony Bill replies, &quot;Before dinner?&quot; In the 1983 film &quot;Gorky Park&quot;, William Hurt orders a stinger, and Brian Dennehy makes a rude remark indicating that the drink is not reputable. Roddy McDowall serves Ruth Gordon a stinger in the film &quot;Lord Love a Duck&quot; (1966), claiming that it is called a &quot;stinger&quot; because it &quot;removes the sting&quot; (of life), but admittedly, the drink he offers her looks nothing like a stinger.

<text>BloggerCon was a user-focused conference for the blogger community that ran between 2003 and 2006. BloggerCon I (October 2003) and II (April 2004), were organized by Dave Winer and friends at Harvard Law School&#x27;s Berkman Center for the Internet and Society in Cambridge, Massachusetts BloggerCon III took place in San Francisco in June 2006. According to the Online Journalism Review, &quot;BloggerCon has lots of cooks, but the chief chef is technologist Dave Winer, co-founder of RSS and the patient zero of blogging. BloggerCon exists because Winer wants it to happen.&quot;

BloggerCon I was initially planned to be financed without corporate sponsors by charging $500 to attend. This plan sparked controversy. A second, free day was later added to the program. For BloggerCon II and III, there was no registration cost; the conference was funded by voluntary contributions from attendees.

On the first, paid day of BloggerCon I, four panels discussed the interaction of blogging with journalism, education, marketing, and presidential politics. The second day&#x27;s panels included various technical and infrastructure issues such as RSS, news aggregators, and what was then called &quot;audioblogging&quot;. The first BloggerCon brought together audioblogging pioneers with developers, whose collective efforts led to the phenomenon that spread six months later under the name podcasting.

For BloggerCon II, the format was changed to create an unconference, with audience participation sessions, loosely moderated by a discussion leader, rather than formal panels or keynotes. One invited participant, Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, was unable to get a visa. He and others were still able to participate in the discussion via an IRC channel projected on a screen.

BloggerCon III met at Stanford Law School on November 6, 2004. Popular sessions included &quot;Podcasting&quot; with Adam Curry, &quot;Overload&quot; with Robert Scoble, and &quot;Making Money&quot; with Doc Searls. It was broadcast with help from ITConversations. Many also participated using IRC.

BloggerCon IV took place in San Francisco on June 23–24, 2006.

<doc id="1140719" wikidata="Q3826415" url="?curid=1140719" title="South Eastern Railway (England)">
<text>The South Eastern Railway (SER) was a railway company in south-eastern England from 1836 until 1922. The company was formed to construct a route from London to Dover. Branch lines were later opened to Tunbridge Wells, Hastings, Canterbury and other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, some older than itself, including the London and Greenwich Railway and the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Most of the company&#x27;s routes were in Kent, eastern Sussex and the London suburbs, with a long cross-country route from in Surrey to Reading, Berkshire.

Much of the company&#x27;s early history saw attempts at expansion and feuding with its neighbours; the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in the west and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in 1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways, work them as a single system (marketed as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.

==Origins of the company==

There had been proposals for a railway between London and Dover in 1825, 1832 and 1835, but they came to nothing due to opposition from landowners or the difficulties of bridging the River Medway near its mouth. On 21 June 1836, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed a local act the (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. lxxv) incorporating the &quot;South Eastern and Dover Railway&quot;, which shortly afterwards changed to the South Eastern Railway.

===Choice of route from London to Dover===

At the time of inauguration there were two potential rail pathways south from London, and the Speaker of the House of Commons had said no further pathways would be permitted. The SER therefore considered routes to Dover from the proposed London and Southampton Railway line at Wimbledon, or from the existing London and Greenwich Railway (L&amp;GR) at Greenwich. The former left London in the wrong direction and then on a roundabout route. The latter provided a useful way for a northern route via Gravesend, Rochester, and Canterbury, except that lengthening the line beyond Greenwich was blocked by opposition from the Admiralty, and this route would involve tunnelling through the North Downs.

The engineer of the new line, William Cubitt, was also engineer of the London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR), which planned to use L&amp;GR lines as far as Corbett&#x27;s Lane in Bermondsey before turning south towards Croydon. A new connection on this line near to Norwood could provide access to a southerly route to Dover via Tonbridge, Ashford and Folkestone. This was less direct than the northerly route but passed through easier country. It involved one significant tunnel through the Shakespeare Cliff near Dover. This was the route first chosen by the SER at its inauguration.

During parliamentary discussions on the proposed route of the London and Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) during 1837, pressure was put on the SER to divert its proposed route so it could also share the L&amp;BR mainline between Jolly Sailor (Norwood) and Earlswood Common, and then travel eastwards to Tonbridge. Under the scheme proposed by Parliament, the railway from Croydon to Redhill would be built by the L&amp;BR but the SER would have the right to refund half the construction costs and own that part of the line between Merstham and Redhill. The SER gave way to this proposal as it reduced the construction costs, although it resulted in a route longer than by road, running south for and then turning east. It also meant that its trains from London Bridge passed over the lines of three other companies: the L&amp;GR to Corbett&#x27;s Lane Junction, the L&amp;CR as far as &#x27;Jolly Sailor&#x27;, and the L&amp;BR to Merstham.

==Construction of the main line==

Construction began in 1838 at several places simultaneously, and the Shakespeare Tunnel was complete by May 1841 . The L&amp;BR line to Redhill opened on 12 July 1841 and the SER line from Redhill to Tonbridge on 26 May 1842, when SER train services began. The main line reached Ashford on 1 December 1842; the outskirts of Folkestone by 28 June 1843; and Dover by 7 February 1844. On the same day the SER offered to lease the L&amp;BR for 21 years at £100,000 per year, but the offer was turned down. Later that year, the SER refunded to the L&amp;BR £430,000 and took ownership of the southern half of the Croydon-Redhill line. Trains ran toll-free to both companies on this stretch but still had pay on the L&amp;CR from Norwood Junction railway station to Corbett&#x27;s Lane Junction, and the L&amp;GR into London Bridge.

===Folkestone and Dover harbours===
In 1843, when the railway reached the edge of Folkestone, the company bought the silted and nearly derelict harbour, built by Thomas Telford in 1809, for £18,000. The SER dredged the harbour and, after a trial with the paddle steamer &quot;Water Witch&quot;, which also demonstrated that a day excursion from London to Boulogne was feasible, arranged for a packet company to provide a ferry to Boulogne. The following year it established the independent &quot;South Eastern &amp; Continental Steam Packet Company&quot;, which it absorbed in 1853. James Broadbridge Monger was the master of the &quot;Water Witch&quot; from 1839 to 1844. From 1844 on, he was master of three vessels which steamed from Dover and Folkestone to Boulogne, Calais and Ostend with passengers and cargo: &quot;Lord Warden&quot;, &quot;Princess Helena&quot; and &quot;Princess Maude&quot;. In December 1848 it opened a steeply graded branch from the Folkestone station to the harbour.

The SER opened Dover (later Dover Town) station on 7 February 1844. This was originally a terminus, but in 1860 the line was continued to Admiralty Pier. Thereafter the SER concentrated most of its resources into developing Folkestone Harbour, which became its principal base for cross-channel ferries. The company had complete control of Folkestone whereas at Dover it had to negotiate with both the Admiralty and the local town council, and the rail route from Boulogne to Paris was better developed than that from Calais.

In 1848 the SER served two steam ships a day between Folkestone and Boulogne, one a day between Dover and Calais, and one between Dover and Ostend.

===Bricklayers Arms terminus===
During 1843, before the main line was complete, the SER and the L&amp;CR became anxious about the charges imposed by the L&amp;GR for the use of the terminus at London Bridge and its approaches. Parliament had relaxed restrictions on new railways into London and so SER sought authority to construct a branch from Corbett&#x27;s Lane to a new temporary passenger terminus and goods station at Bricklayers Arms railway station, for use by both railways, removing the need to use the Greenwich Railway. This opened 1 May 1844. According to Charles Vignoles, &#x27;the making of Bricklayers Arms station was a matter of compulsion in driving the Greenwich people to reasonable terms&#x27;. Plans to extend from Bricklayers Arms to a new SER terminus at Hungerford Bridge, nearer the centre of London, were rejected by Parliament. Similarly, a revised proposal to extend the line to Waterloo Road in 1846 was rejected by a committee of Parliament.

The L&amp;GR was nearly bankrupt in 1844 and the SER leased its line from 1 January 1845. It became the Greenwich branch of that railway. Thereafter further developments were at London Bridge, and following a shunting accident during August 1850 which caused the collapse of a large part of the station roof, the SER closed Bricklayers Arms terminus to passenger traffic in 1852 converting it into a goods facility.

==Secondary main lines and branch lines==
Over the next two decades the SER system spread throughout Kent and Surrey, building lines to connect towns to its main line or acquiring those already in existence.

=== Canterbury and Whitstable Railway ===
In 1844 the SER took over the bankrupt Canterbury and Whitstable Railway, which had opened in 1830. This continued to be worked as an isolated line until the SER reached Canterbury from Ashford in 1846, with its line to Ramsgate.

===Medway Valley Line===
The first branch built by the SER was the Medway Valley Line on 24 September 1844, from Paddock Wood to Maidstone. This was continued to Strood railway station on 18 June 1856.

===Greenwich Line===

Leasing the London and Greenwich Railway from 1 January 1845 gave the company control of its main line into London and provided a branch line to Greenwich. Further eastward extension was initially not possible due to opposition from the Greenwich Hospital, but it was eventually opened in 1878 when the line joined the North Kent Line at Charlton.

===Tunbridge Wells and Hastings Line===
A secondary main line from Tonbridge to the outskirts of Tunbridge Wells opened 20 September 1845. It was extended to Tunbridge Wells Central on 25 November 1846. By 1 September 1851 the line had reached Robertsbridge and was extended to Battle, Bopeep Junction and on 1 February 1852. By this time Hastings had already been reached by the SER in a roundabout route from Ashford, which opened 13 February 1851. From this line was a short branch to Rye Harbour.

===Ramsgate, Margate and Deal Lines===
During 1846 the SER opened another secondary main line from Ashford to Ramsgate with a branch from there to Margate on 1 December 1846. A further branch from this line from Minster to Deal was opened 7 July 1847.

===Gravesend and Strood Lines (North Kent)===
As the SER was prevented from extending its Greenwich line, it opened a secondary main line from Lewisham to Gravesend and then to Strood on the banks of the Medway on 30 July 1849. The second half between Gravesend and Strood had been built as the Gravesend and Rochester Canal and a single track railway had been added to form the Gravesend and Rochester Railway. The SER offered to buy the canal and railway in 1845, filled in the canal through the Higham to Strood tunnel and doubled the track. The first section (built by the SER) connected Woolwich and Dartford to the railway network.

In 1852 a freight branch was constructed from this line at Charlton to the Thames at Angerstein&#x27;s Wharf, used for landing coal. A line opened on 18 June 1856 up the Medway valley to Maidstone West.

==Early management of the company 1843–1855==
In September 1845 the SER appointed James Macgregor (sometimes spelled McGregor or M&#x27;Gregor) to a new post combining the roles of Chairman and Managing Director. He exercised absolute power over the company for the next nine years, until he was ultimately forced to resign in 1854 and leave the Board in 1855. Macgregor&#x27;s lack of accountability, his opaque and at times dubious working methods led to a number of strategic errors in the building of new lines and in the company&#x27;s relations with its neighbours, which would have an adverse impact on the company for decades to come.

===Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway===
In 1846 the SER supported the formation of the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway, a scheme to build a line connecting the London to Brighton main line at Redhill with the Great Western Railway (GWR) main line at Reading, and agreed to operate its services. The new line was completed 4 July 1849, and in 1852 was absorbed by SER. Both the LB&amp;SCR and London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) regarded this line as a significant incursion into their areas of operation. Likewise the acquisition of a line so remote from its main area of operation, and of doubtful profitability, caused heated discussion and the resignation of several directors, who felt that the company should rather secure its territory and develop services in Kent, as the LB&amp;SCR was doing in Sussex. It would also ultimately bring about Macgregor&#x27;s downfall. Nevertheless, in 1858 the GWR, L&amp;SWR, and SER made a three-year agreement to share traffic and provide a connecting line between their stations at Reading. The line now (2015) forms part of the North Downs Line.

===Early relations with the London Brighton and South Coast Railway===
During the first years, relations between the SER, L&amp;CR and L&amp;BR were cordial, with the companies pooling locomotives and forming a joint locomotive committee. However, all three considered they were disadvantaged by this arrangement and in 1845 gave notice of withdrawal. The merger of the L&amp;BR and L&amp;CR to form the LB&amp;SCR in July 1846 created a powerful rival to the SER in areas of east Sussex and east Surrey not yet connected to the railway. Relations between the two companies were bad from the outset, especially at those sites where they shared facilities, such as the approaches to London Bridge, East Croydon, and Redhill. Also the SER had long wanted to build a line to Brighton, and the LB&amp;SCR had inherited plans for a line into mid-Kent from the L&amp;CR, and from Bulverhythe (St Leonards) to Ashford via Hastings from the L&amp;BR. Matters were further complicated in 1846 when the SER was empowered to build a line from its existing branch at Tunbridge Wells to Hastings.

Unsuccessful discussions took place regarding a merger of the two companies, but eventually an agreement on 10 July 1848 (ratified in Parliament in 1849) abolished tolls for using each other&#x27;s lines and prevented further eastward expansion by the LB&amp;SCR beyond Hastings and westward further expansion by the SER. Under this agreement the LB&amp;SCR, would share the line from Bulverhythe to Hastings and transfer to the SER its rights to build a line to Ashford but at the same time it retained the right to use the Bricklayers Arms branch and construct its own goods depot on the site for a rent of one shilling (£0.05) per year.

The 1848/9 agreement did not prevent further squabbling between the two companies, notably with the opening of the railway from Ashford to Hastings in 1851. The LB&amp;SCR had originally sought to build it and then had attempted to delay its completion by the SER. In retaliation, the SER attempted to deny LB&amp;SCR access to its station at Hastings. The matter was resolved in court in favour of the LB&amp;SCR, but victory was short-lived as the following year the SER opened its lines from Tunbridge Wells, reducing the distance by rail to Hastings from London.

===Closing the capital account===
Macgregor&#x27;s greatest strategic mistake was his failure to address the concerns of the proposers of the East Kent Railway, which ultimately led to the creation of an important rival in northern Kent and also for the Continental rail traffic.

Between 1844 and 1858, the SER had a monopoly of rail transport in Kent, but served the north of the county poorly. The SER line from Strood into London had opened in 1849. A plan to continue this line as far as Chilham where it would join the Ashford to Canterbury Line, was rejected by Parliament in 1847 due to financial considerations and never resurrected. One group of SER directors were anxious to &#x27;close the capital account&#x27; and build no more lines, even though this might leave the field open to rival projects, as would later prove to be the case. As a result, there was no planned service to the north Kent towns to the east of the River Medway. Likewise SER routes to Margate, Deal, and Canterbury were circuitous and other towns had no railway at all. As a result of the railway&#x27;s unwillingness to act, plans for an independent line from the SER station at Strood to Faversham and Canterbury were made following a public meeting at Rochester in 1850.

==Factionalism and bad management 1854–1866==
Following Macgregor&#x27;s resignation in 1854, there followed a decade of factionalism among the directors and equally poor management, described by Samuel Smiles the company Secretary as &#x27;not so much business as speech-making, that seemed to be the work of the Board.&#x27; It was during this period that there was a continuing failure to deal with underlying problems in the company, and its relationships with its neighbours together with further strategic errors which weakened what might otherwise have been a profitable enterprise. One nickname for the SER in the 1860s was the Rattle and Smash Railway.

===East Kent and London Chatham &amp; Dover Railways===
The East Kent Railway (EKR) from Strood to Canterbury, proposed in 1850 achieved parliamentary approval in 1853, and also for an extension to Dover in 1855, but it failed to secure running powers over the SER line into London: instead the SER reluctantly agreed to handle London traffic from the line. Many SER directors were convinced the line would never be built, or would go bankrupt, and so took no interest in the scheme or in suggestions that the line should amalgamate with their railway. They were proved wrong.

In 1856 the EKR again unsuccessfully sought running powers over the SER into London, and then obtained powers to build its own route via St Mary Cray railway station and Bromley South railway station. The EKR secured running powers over the LB&amp;SCR lines into Pimlico and, after 1860, to Victoria Station. The EKR became the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) in 1859 and completed its rival route to Dover on 22 July 1861. By July 1863 the LCDR had its own independent route to Victoria, and in 1864 its own terminus on the edge of the City of London at Ludgate Hill. For 36 years it would be an important competitor of the SER both for Continental and also local traffic in Kent.

A further serious strategic mistake was the refusal of the SER to accept the terms of the contract for the cross-channel carriage of mails in 1862, as this stipulated the use of Dover rather than Folkestone. This enabled the LCDR, which had only reached Dover in 1861, to secure the contract and the following year would give it leverage when it came to negotiating the Continental Traffic Agreement.

===Continued bad relations with the LB&amp;SCR===
A new and protracted dispute with the LB&amp;SCR took place between 1855 and 1862 over the Caterham branch line, which was built by an independent company in SER territory but connected to the railway network at the former LB&amp;SCR station at Purley. The SER refused to allow the line to be leased to the LB&amp;SCR, which in turn refused to re-open its station, delayed opening of the line for a year, and made the Caterham company bankrupt. The SER took over the line in 1859, but the LB&amp;SCR made life difficult for passengers to London.

The SER objected to the LB&amp;SCR agreement with the East Kent Railway to provide access over its lines to its Pimlico station and later the jointly owned Victoria station (see below), and also for handling that company&#x27;s freight traffic at &#x27;Willow Walk&#x27;, (a part of the Bricklayers Arms goods facility). Further difficulties between occurred at East Croydon railway station in 1862. With completion of the LB&amp;SCR line to Victoria station, extra platforms were needed to accommodate the service. The platforms were treated by the LB&amp;SCR as a separate station, named &quot;New Croydon&quot;, with its own ticket office, and ran exclusively LB&amp;SCR services. This enabled the railway to offer cheaper fares from New Croydon to London than the SER which only had use of East Croydon station. The SER responded by gaining parliamentary approval to build its own line from New Beckenham to a new station at Croydon (Addiscombe Road), which opened 1 April 1864.

Relations with the LB&amp;SCR reached a low point in 1863, when the general manager and secretary had to report the history of relations between the companies since the agreement of 1848–9. This set out the history although from the SER perspective.

A branch from Lewisham to Beckenham opened in 1857, becoming the temporary terminus of the East Kent Railway. Following the dispute with the LB&amp;SCR over New Croydon (see below) an extension of this line to Addiscombe (Croydon) was opened in 1864.

===Continental Traffic Agreement (1863)===
The SER and the LCDR agreed to pool Continental traffic receipts between Hastings and Margate, together with local receipts to Dover and Folkestone. It then re-allocated them to a formula which gave the SER two-thirds of the receipts in 1863, gradually reducing to one half in 1872. The agreement appeared to unduly favour the LCDR, particularly after 1870. It did not prevent competition as the railways could claim additional funds from the pool if they carried more than their proportion of customers. Both companies sought to get round the agreement – the LCDR by establishing a Continental service from Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, which was outside the scope of the agreement. Similarly, the SER built a local station at Shorncliffe on the edge of Folkestone, which it claimed was not part of Folkestone, and from which it charged lower fares.

Following establishment of a LCDR service from Queenborough to Flushing, Netherlands in 1876, the SER was allowed to build the Hundred of Hoo Railway from its line near Gravesend to a new port on the across the Medway from Queenborough, called Port Victoria. The line opened in September 1882.

===Improvements to the main line===
In 1860 the LCDR had a more direct route to Dover than the SER, and both the company&#x27;s rivals had access to a London terminus in the prosperous West End of London while the SER only had its terminal on the south side of the river Thames at London Bridge.

====Charing Cross and Cannon Street Stations====

The SER converted part of London Bridge to through platforms and extended to near Waterloo, over Hungerford Bridge to a station at Charing Cross which opened on 11 January 1864. When the LCDR built a line to Ludgate Hill railway station in the City of London in 1865, the SER built a new bridge over the Thames and a city terminus at Cannon Street railway station, which opened 1 September 1866. These extensions were difficult to operate and were congested at peak times.

On 16 August 1866 the SER agreed with the London and North Western Railway to build a joint line between Euston railway station and Charing Cross, with interchange of traffic, but the scheme was abandoned as a result of the 1867 financial crisis.

====Orpington cut-off &amp; Dartford Loop====
The SER therefore constructed the direct line via Sevenoaks to Tonbridge. It involved crossing the North Downs by summits and long tunnels at Knockholt and Sevenoaks. The latter was the longest tunnel in southern England at . This cut-off line, long, reached Chislehurst on 1 July 1865, but took three more years to reach Orpington and Sevenoaks (2 March 1868). The new main line opened on 1 May 1868 when the line reached Tonbridge.

Construction of the main line provided the opportunity to build an improved route to Dartford from Hither Green via Sidcup. This opened 1 September 1866.

====East London Railway====
In 1865 the SER joined a consortium of six railways to form the East London Railway, which used the existing Thames Tunnel to connect Wapping on the north bank of the Thames with Rotherhithe on the south. The other partners were: the Great Eastern Railway (GER), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), the Metropolitan Railway, and the District Railway. Over the next four years it was converted to railway use and connected with existing lines.

The line was principally used for freight across London but the SER introduced a service between and Liverpool Street from April 1880 until March 1884. From March to September 1884 the service ran from Addiscombe to St Mary&#x27;s Whitechapel Road.

==Chairmanship of Edward Watkin==

This period of factionalism was eventually ended with the appointment of a new and able Chairman in March 1866. This was Edward (later Sir Edward) Watkin who was also chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the Metropolitan Railway, as well as being a director of the Chemins de fer du Nord in France. However his appointment was quickly followed by the collapse of bankers Overend, Gurney and Company on 10 May 1866 and the subsequent financial crisis during the following year. This had a severe effect on expansion plans of several railways. No new lines were built by the SER until the opening of the Sandling to Hythe branch line on 9 October 1874. The LCDR went bankrupt and was taken into administration 12 July 1866, and in 1867 the LB&amp;SCR was also on the brink of bankruptcy. The directors and shareholders saw that constant quarrelling between the three companies had damaged their interests and began talks to merge or to work together. In 1868 a Bill was presented to Parliament to allow for co-operative working of railways of southern England (the SER, the LCDR, the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR). However this failed at a late stage when Parliament sought to limit the fares charged by the SER to those of the LB&amp;SCR, and the SER withdrew. A further attempt to merge the SER and LCDR in 1875 failed when the latter withdrew after shareholders felt it favoured the SER.

Watkin had long-term ambitions for the SER to become one link in a chain of &#x27;Watkin&#x27; railways from the industrial north of England to the Continent via a proposed Channel Tunnel. His plans for a Channel Tunnel were ultimately blocked by the War Office, and suspicion fell on James Staats Forbes, chairman of the LCDR for having urged the decision.

===Oxted &amp; Westerham Lines===
One result of improved relations between the SER and the LB&amp;SCR during the 1870s was that the two collaborated in construction of a line between South Croydon on the main Brighton line and Oxted. The completion of the &quot;Orpington cut-off&quot; in 1866 reduced services to and from the growing town of Croydon. The LB&amp;SCR had supported a plan to build the Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway along this route in 1865, but its involvement had been opposed by the SER as being contrary to their agreement, and the scheme was abandoned during the 1867 financial crisis. However, following a revised agreement, the scheme was revived as a joint venture. Beyond Oxted the LB&amp;SCR linked with its lines to East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells, while the SER joined its original main line to Tonbridge Tunbridge Wells and Hastings. Authority for construction of these lines was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.

As a part of the same scheme, the SER at last began to implement plans for the a line from Dunton Green on its new main line to Oxted via Westerham, the first phase of which opened on 7 July 1881. Authorisation for line was first obtained in 1864, but no progress had been made by 1876, when local inhabitants sponsored a bill their own bill, forcing the hand of the SER. In the event only the first phase (from Dunton Green to Westerham) was built, leaving a Branch line rather than a through route. The remaining four miles (6 km) to the new Oxted Line (then still under construction) were never completed due to opposition in the House of Commons and the difficult terrain between Westerham and Oxted.

===Unpopularity of the SER===
During the 1880s and 1890s the SER was accused of only caring about Continental travellers and of neglecting the interests of its other customers. A series of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; in London in 1883 demonstrated how unpopular the railway had become with its regular commuters. Ernest Foxwell, also writing in 1883, stated &#x27;The great blots on the South Eastern are its unpunctuality, its fares, its third class carriages, and the way in which &quot;local&quot; interests are sacrificed to Continental traffic.&#x27; Hamilton Ellis later described both the SER and the LCDR at this time as &#x27;bywords of poverty stricken inefficiency and dirtiness&#x27;. In spite of these criticisms the shareholders stuck with their chairman, until they eventually realised that their own interests were suffering as well. A scathing article in &quot;The Investors Review&quot; for June 1894 demonstrated how poorly Watkin&#x27;s railways had performed financially compared to others, and referred to the SER&#x27;s &#x27;bitter hatred towards all but first-class travellers, [and] their determined cultivation of the art of running empty coaches&#x27;. The article finished,
:the Company is now almost too weak to turn round and adopt a wise policy. It might become bankrupt in the process ; so the best thing to do is to leave it severely alone. Just as none travel by it who can find another route, so none should touch its common stocks who are free to do otherwise.

Watkin retired shortly afterwards.

Some of the complaints of unpunctuality of the SER may have been exaggerated, or were at least soon remedied after Watkin&#x27;s departure, since a statistical survey of the company&#x27;s services conducted in 1895 by William Acworth found that, with the exception of the heavily congested and difficult to operate lines between London Bridge and Cannon Street and Charing Cross, the company did not perform significantly worse than others in London in terms of timekeeping.

===Later branches and proposed lines===

During the 1870s and the 1880s the railway attempted to exploit the potential of the East Kent coast as both holiday destinations and potential new channel ports. Thus branches were built from Sandling near Folkestone to Hythe and Sandgate, (opened 9 October 1874); from Dover to Deal and Sandwich (jointly with the LCDR, which opened 15 June 1881); from Appledore to Dungeness (1 April 1883) and New Romney (19 June 1884). (In 1897 the SER obtained powers in the (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. ccxxvii) to build a branch line from Crowhurst railway station to its own station at Bexhill-on-sea in opposition to the existing LB&amp;SCR service to the town.) However this line was not completed until 1902.

On 4 July 1887 the railway opened the Elham Valley Line from Canterbury West to Shorncliffe. However, there was by then already an LCDR line from Canterbury to Dover and so the new line did not attract much traffic. Likewise on 1 October 1892 the Hawkhurst Branch from Paddock Wood to Hope Mill was opened and extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893.

Similarly the company also obtained Parliamentary Powers to build a line from Appledore to Maidstone via Headcorn and the Loose Valley.

====Chatham extension====
Probably the most wasteful competitive venture by the SER was a second bridge over the river Medway between Strood leading to a branch to Rochester (opened July 1891) and to Chatham. The branch line only had a twenty-year life-span as the stations were less conveniently sited than the LCDR alternatives. The LCDR main line was however re-aligned after 1911 to use the newer bridge.

===London suburbs===
Unlike the neighbouring LB&amp;SCR, the SER failed to capitalise on the rapidly growing population of the South London suburbs during the 1870s and 1880s, and to develop effective suburban services. In particular, the area between the North Kent Line the Dartford Loop Line became well populated at this time, but the SER was reluctant to build a proposed Bexleyheath Line, including stations at Blackheath, Eltham, Bexleyheath and Slade Green, in spite of public pressure in the 1880s. This line was eventually built as a private concern in 1895, and it was only after the original investors had gone bankrupt and Watkin had retired that the SER eventually agreed to incorporate it into its system.

As mentioned above, the line from London Bridge to Charing Cross and Cannon Street was particularly congested and difficult to operate. During the early 1890s the SER was actively considering extending the Bricklayers Arms branch into Charing Cross and Cannon Street as a means of relieving this congestion, but deferred making any decision to do so and ultimately the idea was dropped following the operating agreement with the LCDR in 1899, which provided the new &#x27;joint railway&#x27; with two further pathways into London.

One of the last branch lines to be incorporated into the SER was between Purley and Tattenham Corner railway station. The line as far as Chipstead and Kingswood were built by the Chipstead Valley Railway from 1893 and opened in 1897. The extension to Tattenham Corner was built by the Epsom Downs Extension Railway from 1894. Both companies were acquired by the South Eastern Railway., but the line to Tattenham Corner was not completed until 1901, after the working agreement with the LCDR. This line was in the territory of the LB&amp;SCR but provided the railway with access to a proportion of the lucrative Epsom Downs Racecourse traffic.

==South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee==

During the early 1890s competition between the SER and the LCDR reached ruinous proportions with both companies offering nearly identical services to and from the same towns, which inevitably lost money for both companies. However, following the resignation of Watkin in 1894, relations between the two companies gradually improved under his successors Sir George Russell (1895) and, most notably, under Cosmo Bonsor (1897). Bonsor managed to persuade the two boards of governors to see sense and from 1 January 1899 the &quot;South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee&quot; was formed to oversee joint working, with Bonsor as its chairman. On 5 August 1899 the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railways Act 1899 (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. clxviii) was passed, which resulted in the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR). This was not a true merger since each company kept its individual board of directors within the organisation.

The quality of service of the SE&amp;CR and the level of public estimation of its two constituent railways increased considerably during the next thirty-five years. The SER was however abolished on 1 January 1923 under the terms of the Railways Act 1921.

==Train services==
Throughout its independent existence, the SER was primarily a passenger rather than a freight railway, with passenger receipts accounting for more than 72% of its revenues.

===Freight services===
Prior to 1862 the company carried international postal traffic. However, in 1862 they refused to renew the contract as it stipulated the Dover-Calais rather than the SER&#x27;s preferred Folkestone-Boulogne route. As a result, the contract went to the LCDR.

It was not until after the formation of the SECR Management Committee in 1899 that the company began to take the development of its freight traffic seriously, with the ordering of a powerful new freight SECR C class. Prior to that most freight on the system had either been products imported through the Channel ports, or else locally developed freight, such as farm produce travelling to London. The principal freight depot on the system was at Bricklayers Arms.

The cement industry based around Swanscombe and the Medway Towns provided some minerals traffic, but again it was only after the foundation of Blue Circle Industries in 1900 that this was developed. Similarly, the Kent coalfield was not discovered until 1890 and only developed in the early twentieth century.

===Passenger services===
As mentioned above, the SER was accused during the 1880s of concentrating on its Boat trains and Continental passenger traffic at the expense of its local services in Kent and the London suburbs.

====London suburban services====
One area where the SER did fail compared with the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR was in developing effective services to the rapidly growing suburbs of south east London. This was probably due to an unwillingness to generate even more traffic through the very restricted entry pathway into London between Deptford and London Bridge. The SER did however have the advantage of taking commuters far closer to the centres of business and commerce at Charing Cross and Cannon Street, whereas the LB&amp;SCR and LS&amp;WR deposited them south of the river Thames at London Bridge and Waterloo respectively.

====Holiday traffic====
The SER served an area with a long coastline within easy travelling distance of London. During the 1860s the railway was an important factor in the development of holiday destinations such as Margate and Ramsgate in Kent and St Leonards-on-Sea and Hastings in East Sussex.

====Continental excursions====
In May 1844 the SER organised the first of seven rail and ferry excursions that year from London to Boulogne which together carried more than 2,000 people.

====Hop picking====
By the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway was running Hop Pickers&#x27; Specials to transport large numbers of working-class Londoners to towns and villages in Kent and East Sussex for the season.

==Communications, signalling and accidents==

===Electric telegraph===
Electric telegraph was installed throughout the SER by 1848. These were sold to the General Post Office for £200,000 in 1870 ().

===Signals and signal boxes===
===Accidents===
The SER did not have a good safety record with a large number of both major and minor accidents throughout its independent existence.

One of the most notable accidents occurred on 9 June 1865, when the boat train from Folkestone ran onto a partly dismantled bridge near Staplehurst. The locomotive and tender ran across the timber baulks to reach the far side, but the carriages were derailed and fell into the River Beult. The Staplehurst rail crash killed ten passengers and Charles Dickens narrowly avoided severe injury, or even death. He was travelling with Nelly Ternan and her mother at the front of the train in a first-class carriage, which escaped complete derailment when the locomotive and tender left the track as a result of repairs to the line. Timber baulks under the track were being replaced but the foreman mis-read the timetable, and two lengths of rail were missing on the viaduct. As the lead vehicles left the line, the impact on the remaining beams caused the cast iron girders below to fracture, and most of the following vehicles left the viaduct and ended up in the River Beult some below. The foreman was indicted and convicted of manslaughter, and served 6 months hard labour for his crime.

Other significant accidents involving multiple fatalities were as follows:
* 11 December 1844 the boiler explosion of locomotive No. 78 &quot;Forrester&quot; caused a bridge collapse near Bricklayers Arms, Surrey and killed two staff.
* 21 August 1854 a collision at East Croydon railway station killed three passengers. This accident also involved the LB&amp;SCR signalman and was later judged to be partly the result of signalling error and poor communication, as well as the SER driver.
* 12 September 1855 – a collision between two trains near Reading station killed five.
* 28 June 1857 – the Lewisham rail crash killed 11 people. An express train ran into the rear of a stationary train due to driver error.
* 30 June 1858 – a derailment near Chilham railway station due to a mechanical failure killed three persons.
* 16 December 1864 – a collision near Blackheath. A ballast train had divided in a tunnel, and an express passenger train was allowed to enter due to an error by a signalman. Five platelayers were killed.
* January 1877 – a landslip at the eastern end of Martello Tunnel brought down some of chalk, killing three men. The line was closed for two months.
* 7 June 1884 – A double-headed freight train ran into the rear of another freight train at Tub&#x27;s Hill station, . Both crew of the first train were killed. the signalman was charged with causing their deaths. The trains were being worked under the time interval system.
* 9 October 1894 – a collision near Chartham due to an error by a crossing keeper killed seven.
* 21 March 1898 – Collision at St Johns railway station due to incorrect use of signalling equipment, three persons were killed.

==Rolling stock==
Between March 1842, shortly before the SER began to run its services, and March 1844, the rolling stock of the railway was pooled with that of its neighbour and operated by the &#x27;London &amp; Croydon and South Eastern Railways Joint Committee&#x27;. The locomotives were then under the supervision of Benjamin Cubitt at New Cross Depot. In the latter month the pool was also joined by the L&amp;BR. However all three railways felt themselves disadvantaged by the arrangement and in October 1844 the SER gave notice six months notice of withdrawal, which was later extended until 31 January 1846. The existing locomotives and carriages, and those on order, were divided between the three companies.

===Steam locomotives===
The SER owned fifteen locomotives and had a further eleven on order at the formation of the &#x27;London &amp; Croydon and South Eastern Railways Joint Committee&#x27; in 1842. Ten locomotives were built by this committee, and a further 45 were either built or ordered by the enlarged Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee. The SER received 67 of these existing locomotives at the dissolution of the latter committee in 1846. Having decided to withdraw from the locomotive pool, the SER appointed James Cudworth as Locomotive Superintendent on 22 May 1845. Four locomotives were acquired from the &#x27;Gravesend and Rochester Railway in 1847, seven from the L&amp;GR in 1848, but the only original locomotive to work the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway was not added to stock. Between 1846 and 1898 the SER built or purchased 775 locomotives. Of these, 459 were running on 31 December 1898 when they were handed over to the SE&amp;CR.

Under Cudworth the railway was the largest British user of the experimental and ultimately unsuccessful Crampton locomotive type with twenty examples built between 1847 and 1851. He also patented a double-firebox which enabled locomotives to burn cheaper coal without smoke, but were considerably more expensive to build and maintain. Cudworth also provided several sound locomotive types for the railway, but resigned in 1876 after Sir Edward Watkin ordered 20 express locomotives against Cudworth&#x27;s wishes, which subsequently proved to have been unsuccessful.

After a brief interregnum James Stirling was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer on 28 March 1878. He modernised the locomotive stock and was responsible for the building or acquisition of 401 locomotives. Stirling designed some good quality locomotive classes, notably his R 0-6-0, and Q 0-4-4 tank classes, and his O 0-6-0 and F 4-4-0 tender classes. However his determination to maintain standardisation meant that the introduction of larger locomotives was delayed too long and the SER locomotive fleet was underpowered by 1899. As a result, future SE&amp;CR locomotive practice was based on developing LCDR rather than SER designs.

== Locomotive superintendents ==
* – 1845 – Benjamin Cubitt
*1845 – 1876 James I&#x27;Anson Cudworth
*1876 – Alfred Mellor Watkin
*1876 – 1878 Richard Mansell
*1878 – 1898 James Stirling

==Ships==
The South Eastern Railway operated a number of ships from Folkestone and Dover to Boulogne, France and Ostend, Belgium. In 1854 the SER took over the South Eastern &amp; Continental Steam Packet Company.

<doc id="1140725" wikidata="Q237129" url="?curid=1140725" title="Princess Clémentine of Orléans">
<text>Princess Clémentine of Orléans () (3 June 1817 – 16 February 1907), princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and duchess in Saxony, was the sixth child and youngest daughter of Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, and his wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. She was the mother of Ferdinand I, Tsar of Bulgaria.

==Early life==
Marie Clémentine Léopoldine Caroline Clotilde of Orléans, styled &quot;Mademoiselle de Beaujolais&quot;, was born on 3 June 1817 at the Château de Neuilly, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, soon after the Bourbon Restoration. She became a royal princess, &quot;Princess of Orléans&quot;, following her father&#x27;s ascension to the French throne in 1830.

As a young woman, it was written that she &quot;is represented to possess great beauty and accomplishments.&quot; Clémentine was taught history by the radical historian Jules Michelet, who would spend lessons glorifying the French Revolution to his young student.

==Marriage==

As a princess, Clémentine was sought after as a bride by royal families throughout Europe. In 1836, it was rumoured that Clémentine would marry her cousin, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, when the period of his widowhood expired.

King Leopold I of Belgium organised the marriage of Clémentine and Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who was closely connected to the royal houses of the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico and Austria-Hungary. August&#x27;s cousin Albert married August&#x27;s other cousin Queen Victoria and was Prince Consort in the United Kingdom.

The contract of marriage between Clémentine and August was signed in Vienna on 24 February 1843 by the French Ambassador Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, representing Clémentine and the Belgian Ambassador Baron O&#x27;Sullivan, representing August.

Prior to the wedding, the couple sought to reside in Austria, and an application was made to Prince Metternich, to know on what footing the husband of Princess Clémentine would be received at the Court of Vienna. The answer was that Princess Clémentine would be received as Princess of the Royal Family of the Bourbons but the Austrian Court would not recognise August as a Royal Highness. In consequence, it was decided that Prince Augustus would reside in France, and that he would quit the Austrian service and enter that of France, although he was an Austrian subject.

On 20 April 1843, Princess Clémentine married Prince August at the Château de Saint-Cloud, with much &quot;of European royalty in attendance.&quot; The couple had five children.

==Children==
Described as &quot;a woman of formidable character and ambition... Clémentine dominated her husband and spoilt her children. Having herself married no more than a wealthy but undistinguished prince, she sought thrones for her sons.&quot;

==1848 and aftermath==
The Revolutions of 1848 in France led to the end of her father&#x27;s reign, forcing Clémentine and her family to flee France, although Clémentine and Auguste, after ensuring their children were safely away, mingled with the crowd on the Place de la Concorde during the abdication before leisurely travelling to Versailles by train.
She then accompanied her father to the French Embassy in London before heading to Coburg, and then onto Vienna, where her husband was an officer with the Austro-Hungarian army.

Clémentine campaigned to regain the assets taken by decree from the Orléans by Louis Napoleon, seeking the return of the ancestral inheritance by, amongst other things, a letter writing campaign to the French media. She publicly refused the offer from Emperor Napoleon III of 200,000 francs, demanding instead the heritage of her father.

While staying with Queen Victoria in July 1851, Clémentine had to cut short her visit to return to Spain when news arrived that her sons&#x27; tutor &quot;had gone off his head&quot;. Victoria fretted that she would share Clémentine&#x27;s fate and revolution would end the British monarchy, and feared what would happen to her children.

August died in 1881. Clémentine did not remarry, living almost to the age of 90.

==Clémentine and the election to the Bulgarian throne==
Realising that she would never be queen, Clémentine turned her efforts to instilling in Ferdinand, her favorite child, the idea that, as a descendant not only of Louis-Philippe but of the Sun King, he deserved to be a king, of which country was not an important matter.

Clémentine ensured that Ferdinand was widely educated; fluent in several languages, Ferdinand also gained a great interest in the natural sciences and nature, all of which, Clémentine believed, would make Ferdinand an excellent king.

As it turned out, that country was Bulgaria and Clémentine actively lobbied for Ferdinand&#x27;s election as Prince of Bulgaria.

Clémentine then worked to ensure European recognition of Ferdinand, lobbying other heads of state, including Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ferdinand&#x27;s suzerain, Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire. She was said to &quot;cast a beneficent and civilizing glow around [Ferdinand], smoothing away many difficulties by her womanly tact and philanthropic activity.&quot;

Clémentine also found time to design a royal crown for Ferdinand, which included a &quot;requisite number of jewels from her own dressing case&quot;. Unfortunately, Ferdinand made a number of alterations to the design but decided not to pay the painter for painting a portrait of the new crown, leading him to be sued by the painter in a Munich court.

== Clémentine in Bulgaria ==

Clémentine followed her son to Bulgaria, where she became an important person as the mother of the sovereign. Extremely wealthy, Clémentine made herself popular in her adopted homeland by showering money on Bulgaria, including a donation of four million francs towards the completion of a railway line linking Bulgaria to Europe&#x27;s rail network.
She is considered to have had a positive impact on Bulgarian society, and created good will for Ferdinand among the Bulgarian public by large donation to charitable and public causes: she financed the construction of several buildings and institutions, such as a school for the Blind and the Klimentinskata Hospital, and she was also one of the founders of the Bulgarian Red Cross.

Clémentine also gained a reputation for haughtiness and disdain for anyone not of royal blood, although she surprised many observers with her charm and good humour at times. At official dinners, it is said she &quot;smiled at the small incongruities committed during these meals by the uncouth Bulgarian notabilities of those days, and she contrived somehow by her tact, and without ever wounding any one among them, to teach them that peas are not to be eaten with one&#x27;s knife, and that it is not altogether the thing to drink from the finger-bowl.&quot;

A friend of Queen Victoria, Clémentine would lunch with Victoria, particularly at Coburg when Victoria would visit her German relatives.

Said to be &quot;one of the cleverest royal ladies in Europe&quot;, Clémentine was known for her &quot;shrewd mind and a remarkable understanding of European politics and diplomacy&quot;, and was often sent by Ferdinand as his representative on diplomatic missions around Europe.

Clémentine also sought a suitable bride for Ferdinand and was said to be &quot;anxious&quot; to arrange a marriage between Ferdinand and Princess Hélène of Orléans, the Comte de Paris&#x27;s daughter, but Princess Hélène demurred.

In February 1896, Clémentine was reported to have &quot;broken off relations&quot; with Ferdinand following Ferdinand&#x27;s consent to have his son Boris baptised into the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. They reconciled, however, and one of the highlights of her life was seeing Prince Ferdinand hailed as a recognized head of state during an official visit to Paris later that year. This was particularly poignant, as it recalled her father&#x27;s forced abdication and flight from Paris in 1848.
In 1899, her daughter-in-law Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma died following complications from the birth of daughter Nadezhda (who was privately christened Clémentine in honour of her grandmother) and Clémentine assumed responsibility for the education of the children.

Following the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising of 1903 and the resultant increase in refugees, Clémentine co-ordinated the humanitarian response, gathering donations throughout Europe, including 2000 Francs from Kaiser Wilhelm II.

In October 1903, Clémentine, along with Prince Boris, was on the Orient Express when it collided with a goods train near the Serbian border. Although shaken, they were not hurt.

Increasingly deaf as she aged, Clémentine became dependent on an enormous ear trumpet and on people obligingly raising their voices for her. It became an occupational hazard of the Bulgarian court to be caught in long, loud conversations with Clémentine that she was reluctant to end. However, even well into her eighties, Clémentine often traveled to Paris to study the latest fashions.

==Death and legacy==
Although she saw Ferdinand recognized internationally as Prince of Bulgaria (albeit under the nominal suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan), Clémentine died the year before the dream of seeing her son installed as an independent monarch was realized.

Clémentine suffered from inflammation of the right lung in February 1898 and, while there were fears for her health, she was able to recover satisfactorily.

In early February 1907, Clémentine was struck with a bout of influenza, which, considering her age, was feared to be terminal. Clémentine was reported to have recovered from this bout &quot;so that all danger has passed&quot; but remained weak.

Clémentine died in Vienna on 16 February 1907, at the age of eighty-nine. Her influence on Ferdinand was so pronounced that people began to predict his downfall. She was buried in Coburg, with an inscription on her memorial, composed by Ferdinand after his installation as tsar in 1908, reading &quot;King&#x27;s daughter, no Queen herself, yet King&#x27;s mother.&quot;. She was the last surviving child of Louis-Philippe.
