<text>Raymond Tau Henare (born 29 September 1960) is a former New Zealand Māori parliamentarian. In representing three different political parties in parliament—New Zealand First, Mauri Pacific and the National Party—Henare served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1993 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2014.

==Early life==
Henare was born in Ōtara, New Zealand, the son of a 37-year railwayman, on 29 September 1960. Known by his middle name &quot;Tau,&quot; Henare&#x27;s tribal roots are Ngāpuhi and what he characterises as &quot;all the North&quot;. His involvement in politics can be traced to his family&#x27;s involvement in politics. Henare&#x27;s great-grandfather, Taurekareka (Tau) Hēnare, served in Parliament from 1914 to 1938 alongside notable Māori politicians such as Āpirana Ngata, James Carroll and Māui Pōmare. Henare&#x27;s great-uncle was Māori Battalion leader and politician Sir James Henare, who was once considered a candidate to be Governor-General and served as a revered guide and mentor to a young Tau. Henare himself was the brother-in-law to New Zealand Māori politician Tuku Morgan through Henare&#x27;s marriage to the sister of Morgan&#x27;s wife.

As a young boy growing up in Ōtara, Henare had a contrasting childhood. On one hand, he was told almost before he could walk that his future would be politics, which at times requires statesman-like skills to deal with others. On the other, Ōtara was &quot;a place where you learn how to survive,&quot; and it required Henare to learn &quot;to be strong, stand up and not take a backward step.&quot; Looking back on his 1960s childhood in 1996, Henare summed it up as one that &quot;taught me to be proud of who I am.&quot; It also later contributed to what he describes as &quot;youthful exuberance&quot; that lead to a 1980s reputation for being a stirrer and a radical.

In Ōtara, Henare attended Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate. During Year 11 (Form 5) when he was 16, he attained the School Certificate, a former New Zealand secondary school qualification for high school students to progress to Year 12. However, Henare was unsuccessful on his New Zealand University Entrance.

After his schooling ended in 1978, Henare worked at a variety of positions, including wool cleaner and wool classer, where he was responsible for separating sheep&#x27;s wool, organiser for the Northern Clerical Workers&#x27; Union under activist and trade unionist Syd Jackson, community worker, adviser to the Waitakere City Council, and Department of Internal Affairs adviser. During this period, Henare was unemployed for two years. Also, at the age of 25, Henare was arrested for breaking through a police line and laying a wreath for the Māori Battalion during a royal visit on Anzac Day in 1985.

In addition to being influenced by his upbringing and pre-Member of Parliament work, Henare was influenced during his 20s by Māori culture:

In connection with Winston Peters (himself Māori) establishing the New Zealand First party in July 1993, Henare changed the focus of his activities to politics for the 6 November 1993 election.

==Member of Parliament==



Henare first won election to Parliament in the 1993 election as the New Zealand First candidate for the Northern Maori electorate, a surprising result given Labour&#x27;s traditional dominance in the Māori electorates. In defeating incumbent Labour Party member Bruce Gregory, Henare became New Zealand First&#x27;s second MP, joining Peters in the House. As such, Henare became New Zealand First&#x27;s deputy leader. His election helped counter the perception that New Zealand First was merely an extension of Peters.

In December 1994, Northern Maori member of parliament Henare supported Māori tribe&#x27;s paramount chief Sir Hepi Te Heuheu in Heuheu&#x27;s refusal to attend a meeting with then Prime Minister Jim Bolger for a roundtable discussion on government proposals to settle Māori claims, reasoning that the government&#x27;s handling of Maori claims indicated a lack of understanding of the gravity of the issues involved and the meeting would be a public relations exercise. Two months later in February 1995, Henare supported a push to have the United Nations oversee a fiscal envelope negotiation process. by which a monetary cap of $1 billion would be placed in a &quot;fiscal envelope&quot; for use in settling all Treaty of Waitangi grievances. Henare felt that United Nations scrutiny would ensure justice in the face of past treaty breaches and that the Government&#x27;s forceful approach did not create future resentment.

===Minister of Māori Affairs===
In the 1996 election, conducted under the new MMP electoral system, New Zealand First gained fifteen further MPs, and also made a clean sweep of the five Māori electorates. As deputy leader, Henare was second on New Zealand First&#x27;s party list behind Peters. He easily won re-election in his electorate, which had been renamed Te Tai Tokerau. When New Zealand First went into coalition with National, allowing a third term of the fourth National government, Henare joined the Cabinet, with his most prominent ministry that of Māori Affairs. He and the four other New Zealand First Māori MPs — Tuku Morgan, Rana Waitai, Tu Wyllie and Tuariki Delamere — became known as the Tight Five, an allusion to the five tight forwards in a rugby union team.

===Mauri Pacific===
National and New Zealand First initially worked very well together, but relations became more strained after Jenny Shipley ousted Jim Bolger as National leader and Prime Minister in 1997. In August 1998, the coalition started to become unstable, and internal tensions arose within New Zealand First itself. When Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet on 14 August 1998, Peters pulled New Zealand First out of the coalition. However, Henare and several other New Zealand First MPs left the party to sit as independents. They offered their support to National, allowing the government to maintain a slim majority. It later emerged that before departing, Henare had mounted an unsuccessful challenge to Peters. Later in 1998, he banded together with four other MPs who had departed New Zealand First (including two other members of the Tight Five, Morgan and Waitai), to form a new party, Mauri Pacific, with himself as the new party&#x27;s leader. Late in the term, he was criticised for refusing to give Trevor Mallard a chance to speak on the use of the Māori language in Parliament because Mallard is not Māori.

In the 1999 election, Henare finished a distant third in his electorate and Mauri Pacific only gained 0.08% of the vote, forcing Mauri Pacific out of Parliament.

===National Party===
In the 2002 election, after Mauri Pacific&#x27;s dissolution, Henare stood as a candidate for the National Party. He contested the Te Atatū electorate, and was ranked thirty-fifth on National&#x27;s list. On election day, Henare finished second in Te Atatū, and National did not win enough votes for Henare to return to Parliament as a list MP.

In the , Henare stood again as a National candidate, again contesting Te Atatū and holding the 29th slot on the party list. He expressed agreement with the controversial Orewa speech on race relations made by National Party leader Don Brash. Henare almost doubled his vote from the result but still finished a distant second in Te Atatū. However, National&#x27;s gains in the election were enough to return him to Parliament as a list MP. With the National Party in opposition, Henare was a member of the Māori Affairs select committee, an associate spokesperson for Treaty of Waitangi negotiations and early childhood education under Brash, and a spokesperson for Māori affairs under John Key. In October 2007, Henare had an altercation with Labour Party MP Trevor Mallard outside the debating chamber in Parliament House; Mallard was later convicted of fighting in a public place.

In , Henare contested Te Atatū; again, he finished second and was returned as a list MP. The National Party formed a government but Henare was not appointed as a Minister; instead, he was named chairperson of the Māori affairs select committee. In 2009, Henare was additionally appointed deputy chairperson of the select committee considering legislative changes following the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance. In August 2009, it emerged that Henare had sent an email to his colleagues lobbying for the right to vote against part of the Auckland governance legislation, in particular the part that denied separate Māori seats on the new Auckland Council which had been promoted by the ACT Party. In response to reaction to the email, Henare made a number of challenging remarks about Māori Party co-leader Pita Sharples. Ultimately, no separate Māori seats were established. In February 2010, Henare&#x27;s Employment Relations (Workers&#x27; Secret Ballot for Strikes) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill was enacted in May 2012.

In , Henare contested Te Atatū to come in second and be returned as a list MP. He was reappointed to the chair of the Māori affairs committee. In March 2012, Henare married Ngaire Brown, his long-term partner, in a Parliament select committee room. The wedding celebrant was fellow MP Chris Auchinvole, Paula Bennett spoke, and Parekura Horomia gave the mihi (formal speech). In addition to his public office, Henare held positions as a talkback host on Newstalk ZB, an early childhood education consultant, a trustee on the Kura Kaupapa board and the Rutherford College board, and chairman of Tu Tangata education provider.

In late 2012 Henare was looking to succeed Lockwood Smith as Speaker, but dropped his bid when he lost the backing of the Māori Party. The Māori Party said they were not responsible for the failure of his bid, they were simply canvassing whether it was likely he would be appointed Speaker, and that ultimately they believed that Henare did not have the support.

In April 2014, Henare announced his intention to retire from politics at the 2014 general election, influenced by an expected low list placing.

<doc id="1120612" wikidata="Q1231843" url="?curid=1120612" title="Roger of Howden">
<text>Roger of Howden or Hoveden (died 1202) was a 12th-century English chronicler, diplomat and head of the minster of Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

==Roger and Howden minster==
Roger was born to a clerical family linked to the ancient minster of St Peter of Howden, and succeeded his father Robert of Howden as its head, or &quot;persona&quot;. The date Roger was appointed to the minster by its patrons, the monks of Durham cathedral priory, has been located as around 1169. His title of &#x27;magister&#x27; is evidence that he received an education at one of the greater schools of his day, as is also evident from his considerable literary output. Not long after succeeding his father he came into conflict with the lord of Howden and the surrounding district of Howdenshire, Bishop Hugh du Puiset of Durham. Bishop Hugh had made grants of tithes in Howdenshire to the hospital of Kepier in the city of Durham, ignoring the prior rights of the church of Howden. Roger pushed back with the assistance of the monks of the cathedral priory of Durham, the patrons of the minster, and eventually the bishop withdrew the grant. However, Bishop Hugh did not take the defeat lightly, and retaliated by attempting to remove Roger as minster head, alleging irregularities in his presentation to the post. The case went all the way to Rome and though Roger vindicated his appointment, relations between him and Bishop Hugh remained uneasy for the rest of his life.

==Courtier and diplomat==
Most of Roger&#x27;s public career was taken up in service to the Angevin kings of England. A good deal of his activity on behalf of Henry II can be reconstructed from his &quot;Gesta Henrici Secundi&quot; (Deeds of Henry II), which originated as a journal of his time in the royal court. From this can be found evidence that he accompanied the king&#x27;s embassy to Pope Alexander in 1171, and in 1174 was sent from France on a secret mission to the lords of Galloway. In 1175 he appears as a negotiator between the king and a number of English religious houses. In 1180 and 1182–3 he was again at Rome as an English agent in the matter of the disputed election to the see of St Andrews in Scotland. Roger seems from these missions to have acquired a reputation as a reliable agent in ecclesiastical affairs and in Scotland and the borders in particular. He was employed on at least one occasion as a royal justice, serving in 1189 on the assize of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, Cumberland and Northumberland. After Henry II&#x27;s death in 1189 Roger continued in service to his successor, Richard I. In 1195 he was once again involved in a mission to Scotland, and by then his prominence had led to his acquisition of a canon&#x27;s stall in Glasgow Cathedral.

==Roger and the Third Crusade==
In 1189 Bishop Hugh du Puiset was appointed with the chancellor, William de Longchamp, by King Richard as joint justiciars to rule England in his absence. By this time Roger and he had a working relationship and Roger can be found accompanying the bishop in his household at the end of 1189 and then across to France. So he was a witness when Longchamp staged a violent coup against Bishop Hugh on his return to England in the early summer of 1190. The bishop was put under house arrest in his residence at Howden. Roger was rapidly commissioned to lead a covert mission to report the outrage to King Richard, who was still at the time in France. His part in the affair was revealed by the recent discovery of the journal of his voyage from Howden to Marseille in July 1190, where he successfully delivered the bishop&#x27;s complaint to the king, along with a substantial bribe to get royal writs reversing Longchamp&#x27;s coup. Rather than return to Howden, Roger joined the king&#x27;s retinue and accompanied him to Sicily and Palestine, appearing with a group of fellow Yorkshiremen in a document drafted at the siege of Acre in 1191. Roger returned later that year with the fleet of Philip II of France and so did not accompany his own king on his disastrous return voyage.

==Death==
Roger continued his work on his chronicle of England through to 1201, when he was deeply interested in the preaching mission of Abbot Eustace of Flay to England, and indeed records he went to York to hear him. Roger survived into the next year, for the process of appointing a successor to him at Howden minster was under way in September 1202, when rival candidates had begun lawsuits.

==Historical works==
There are two chronicle texts associated with Roger, and though they are clearly related there has been a long academic debate as to whether he authored both. The earlier is the &quot;Gesta Henrici II et Gesta Regis Ricardi&quot; (Deeds of Henry II and King Richard). It runs from 1169 to 1192 and much of its content is repeated and revised in the &quot;Chronica magistri Rogeri de Hoveden&quot; (Chronicles of Master Roger of Howden) which offers the story of England before Henry II&#x27;s reign as well as continuing on until 1201. The earlier text was formerly ascribed to Benedict of Peterborough but the only connection with him is that the abbot was sent by Roger a draft of the work up until 1177 apparently for his comment. Opinion is now that both works were by Roger and represent different stages of the evolution of the chronicle. It began in 1169 as a journal that he commenced when he joined the royal court. By 1177 Roger had developed ambitions for it and was reframing his &quot;Gesta&quot; as a more general chronicle of Angevin England. On his return to England in 1191 he decided that it would form the core of an English history, and he began the major revision that produced the &quot;Chronica&quot;. For English history before 1148 Roger used the text known as the &quot;Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obitum Bedae&quot; (History of the Saxons or English, following on from the death of Bede) which was drafted at Durham cathedral priory using the works of Henry of Huntingdon and Symeon of Durham. From 1148 to 1170 Roger used the &quot;Melrose Chronicle&quot; (edited for the Bannatyne Club in 1835 by Joseph Stevenson) and a collection of letters bearing upon the Thomas Becket controversy. He also employed material from his journal of the Third Crusade for the period 1190–1. As an author Howden is usually impersonal, and makes no pretence to literary style, quotes documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His chronology is tolerably exact. On foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he is very well informed. He abstracted himself entirely from his narrative even when he is known to have been present at what he was recording, as in the mission of 1190 to Marseille. This was clearly his idea as to how the author of a public history should conduct himself. Roger was not without prejudices, however. He disliked King Philip II of France, the enemy of his Angevin masters. He could not bring himself to say anything complimentary of Bishop Hugh du Puiset, whom he had reason to resent. He was outraged at and contemptuous of the impossible conduct of Archbishop Geoffrey of York, his diocesan bishop.

==Other works==
The discovery in the last decade of the twentieth century in French libraries of two MSS which include three separate tracts which can be associated with Roger of Howden has led to a re-evaluation of his intellectual interests and capacities. The largest of them is entitled &quot;De Viis Maris&quot; (On Sea Voyages) and its authorship by Roger is not in doubt. It clearly draws on the same material he used in his historical account of his mission to Marseille and voyage to Acre. It is a portolan of a voyage from a landing on the River Ouse near Howden to a transhipment point on the Humber and thence around England to Dartmouth. From there the author shipped around the Iberian peninsula to Marseille. He continued onward down the coast of Italy to Sicily and Messina. The author makes many geographical and historical digressions about seamarks, cities and personalities as he goes, with a clear interest in winds, vessels and expanses of water. Included with this are two other tracts, an &quot;Expositio Mappe Mundi&quot; (Explanation of the Mappa Mundi) and the &quot;Liber Nautarum&quot; (Book of Mariners). They echo the preoccupations of the &quot;De Viis Maris&quot; and form one collection with it, though they cannot conclusively be said to be by the same author. The &quot;De Viis Maris&quot; offers an insight into Roger&#x27;s personality: a seasoned and sociable traveller, perpetually curious about his world and the cities and peoples he encountered in his extensive travels. The technical aspects of maritime and river transport were plainly a source of fascination to him, not surprisingly in an international diplomat and frequent traveller.

<text>The Nightfly is the debut solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Donald Fagen. Produced by Gary Katz, it was released October 1, 1982, by Warner Bros. Records. Fagen is best known for his work in the group Steely Dan, with whom he enjoyed a successful career since the 1970s. The band separated in 1981, leading Fagen to pursue a solo career. Although &quot;The Nightfly&quot; includes a number of production staff and musicians who had played on Steely Dan records, it was Fagen&#x27;s first release without longtime collaborator Walter Becker.

Unlike most of Fagen&#x27;s previous work, &quot;The Nightfly&quot; is highly autobiographical. Many of the songs relate to the cautiously optimistic mood of his suburban childhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s and incorporate such topics as late-night jazz disc jockeys, fallout shelters, and the Cuban Revolution. Recorded over eight months at various studios between New York City and Los Angeles, the album is an early example of a fully digital recording in popular music. The nascent technology, as well as the perfectionist nature of its engineers and musicians, made the album difficult to record.

&quot;The Nightfly&quot; was well-received, both critically and commercially. It was certified platinum in both the US and UK and generated two popular singles with the top 40 hit &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; and the MTV favorite &quot;New Frontier&quot;. Among critics, &quot;The Nightfly&quot; gained widespread acclaim and received seven nominations at the 1983 Grammy Awards. The relatively low-key but long-lived popularity of &quot;The Nightfly&quot; led Robert J. Toth of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2008 to dub the album &quot;one of pop music&#x27;s sneakiest masterpieces.&quot;

== Background ==
Donald Fagen, born in Passaic, New Jersey, in 1948, grew up with an affinity for music. As a kid, he enjoyed listening to rock and roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Fats Domino, but personally felt that, as rock music gained popularity, it lost an edge. Fagen, a &quot;lonely&quot; child, then turned to late-night jazz radio shows for the vitality he felt the new music lacked. As he got older, he intended to go to graduate school and pursue literature. Instead, he was &quot;swept up&quot; into the counterculture at Bard College, where he met Walter Becker. They later moved to Los Angeles at the suggestion of their friend Gary Katz and took jobs as staff writers for ABC Records. Together, they formed Steely Dan, releasing their first album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, in 1972. Over the course of the decade, the group became enormously successful on the strength of the albums &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; (1973), &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (1974), &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1975), &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; (1976), and &quot;Aja&quot; (1977), the band&#x27;s best-selling effort and a critical favorite. They gradually shifted from performing live to working solely in the studio, making the project a revolving selection of session musicians at the behest of Fagen and Becker.

Their relationship became strained during the making of 1980&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot;, largely due to their insistence on perfection. Both Becker and Fagen would later recall they seemed depressed. In addition, Becker was in the midst of a drug problem and went through a withdrawal stage. Though Fagen imagined they might &quot;stick it out for a while,&quot; he admitted to Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in an article published on June 17, 1981, that the group had indeed separated. &quot;Basically, we decided after writing and playing together for 14 years, we could use a &quot;changement d&#x27;air&quot; as the French say,&quot; he told Palmer. After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, which got him back into the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter. &quot;Working on it has been interesting. The fact that it&#x27;s not a Steely Dan album has freed me from a certain image, a preconceived idea of how it&#x27;ll sound,&quot; he said at the time. Fagen had hoped to record music on his own &quot;a year or so&quot; prior to the duo&#x27;s breakup. The album was originally slated to be titled &quot;Talk Radio&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
To prepare to use the digital technology, the album&#x27;s engineers took classes at 3M in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
&quot;The Nightfly&quot; was recorded in 1981–82 at Soundworks Digital Audio/Video Recording Studios and Automated Sound in New York City, and at Village Recorders in Los Angeles. The producer was Gary Katz, the album engineer was Roger Nichols and the mixer was Elliot Scheiner; all had worked on most of the seven previous Steely Dan albums. Many of the musicians had also played on Steely Dan records, including Jeff Porcaro, Rick Derringer and Larry Carlton. Similar to the &quot;Aja&quot; and &quot;Gaucho&quot; albums, a large number of studio musicians were employed, with the liner notes crediting a total 31 musicians. 

During a radio interview on &quot;Off the Record&quot; in 1983, Fagen revealed that, though he had considered songwriting one of his strengths, and that initially the album&#x27;s songs came to him easily, he began to struggle without his long-term co-writer Walter Becker. This writing difficulty turned into a lengthy writer&#x27;s block after the album was finished. His demos for the album were mostly composed on keyboards and a drum machine and remained without lyrics, to allow for alteration when in the studio.

&quot;The Nightfly&quot; is one of the earliest examples of fully digital recording in popular music. Katz and Fagen had previously experimented with digital recording for &quot;Gaucho&quot;, which ended up entirely analog. Nichols conducted experiments and found that the digital recordings sounded better than those recorded to magnetic tape. &quot;The Nightfly&quot; was recorded using 3M&#x27;s 32-track and four-track recorders. Nichols built a new drum machine, the Wendel II—a sequel to the original Wendel, which was employed for their work on &quot;Gaucho&quot;. The new model was upgraded from 8 bits to 16 bits and &quot;plugged straight into the 3M digital machines, so there was no degradation&quot; in sound. 

Problems with the technology persisted in the beginning, particularly regarding the alignment of the 3M machines. Representatives from 3M had to be called to align the machines, but eventually Fagen and Nichols grew tired of this. Nichols and engineers Jerry Garsszva and Wayne Yurgelun took classes at 3M&#x27;s Minnesota headquarters and returned knowing how to align the machines themselves. &quot;I was ready to transfer to analog and give it up on several occasions, but my engineering staff kept talking me into it&quot;, Fagen remembered. They practiced an early form of &quot;comping&quot; Fagen&#x27;s vocals—which they called &quot;beat[ing] the computer&quot;—wherein he would record multiple takes and the engineers would pick the best lines from each take. On &quot;Walk Between Raindrops&quot;, they combined bass parts playing on a keyboard bass and bass guitar. Doubling bass lines would &quot;become common practice on many records&quot;, according to writer James Sweet.

Fagen opted to overdub each part separately for &quot;The Nightfly&quot;. It became enormously difficult, between this approach and the new technology, to record the album. Pianist Michael Omartian &quot;objected strongly&quot; when Fagen tasked him to &quot;set the groove&quot; of the title track on his own, with nothing but a click track. On another occasion, Fagen &quot;demanded subtle timing differences between the left and right-hand piano parts&quot; on &quot;Ruby Baby&quot;. The effect he desired was achieved with Omartian and Greg Phillinganes playing together on the same keyboard. For the &quot;party noises&quot; in &quot;Ruby Baby&quot;, the team suspended a microphone from the ceiling of Studio 54 – just next door to the studio they were working in – and recorded one of Jerry Rubin&#x27;s &quot;business parties&quot;. Unsatisfied with the results, the group instead held a party in the studio by themselves and included that ambience in the song.

Larry Carlton performs lead guitar on much of the album and recorded his pieces in four days. During his time with the group, he discovered a humming sound coming from his amplifier. The engineers discovered the source on the outside of the building: a large magnet &quot;that formed part of the New York subway system&quot;. In one instance, a strange smell permeated the studio space at Soundworks. The studio staff &quot;gutted&quot; the studio, removing its air conditioning, carpeting, and recording console until they discovered the cause of the smell: a deceased rat in a drainpipe. Sessions regularly stretched long into the evening; Fagen would often refer to this as &quot;being on the night train&quot;. The album took eight months to record and was mixed in 10 days.

== Composition ==

&quot;The Nightfly&quot; is considered more jazzy than Fagen&#x27;s previous work with Steely Dan, and his lyrics are more wistful and nostalgic than biting. Fagen aimed for his lyrics to have &quot;as little irony as possible&quot;, and his goal was to make an album that was fun to listen to. As many of the songs come from an adolescent viewpoint, he hoped for them to maintain &quot;a certain innocence&quot;. Walter Becker was responsible for the more sardonic elements in Steely Dan, and many writers have considered his absence the reason for the album&#x27;s &quot;warm and nostalgic&quot; tone. Another difference between &quot;The Nightfly&quot; and his work with Becker is that it maintains a focus on a &quot;certain period [or] motif&quot;, according to Fagen. Though Fagen hints in the album&#x27;s liner notes that it is an autobiographical piece, he downplayed this notion in a later interview: &quot;It is not me exactly. It is a composite character of myself, what I remember and people I knew. Plus, it includes my feelings in retrospect.&quot;

According to Sam Sutherland, writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Fagen&#x27;s songs &quot;shimmer with jazz harmonies and alternately swing, shuffle or bounce to a samba&quot;. Will Fulford-Jones, in his appraisal of the album in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, considered it ironic in the sense that while it focuses on a simpler time, its production sounded like a modern Steely Dan album. Fagen held a &quot;propensity for the perfect drum track&quot;, and multiple drummers are credited on the album, sometimes on the same song. For example, on &quot;I.G.Y.&quot;, James Gadson played the snare drum, kick drum, and hi-hat, and Jeff Porcaro performed the tom-tom fills. Even still, some songs contain the drum machine Wendel II. Fagen feared listeners finding plagiarism in his lyrics, so he altered a lyric in &quot;The Goodbye Look&quot;—&quot;Behind the big casinos by the beach&quot;—as it &quot;reminded him of a line from a well-known poem&quot;. He was also concerned the &quot;late line&quot; lyrics in the title song were too close to the late-night news program &quot;Nightline&quot;.

== Songs ==

The album opens with &quot;I.G.Y.&quot;, the title of which refers to the &quot;International Geophysical Year&quot;, an event that ran from July 1957 to December 1958. The I.G.Y. was an international scientific project promoting collaboration among the world&#x27;s scientists. Fagen&#x27;s lyrics reference, from the point of view of that time, an optimistic vision of futuristic concepts such as solar-powered cities, a transatlantic tunnel, permanent space stations, and spandex jackets. Fagen remembered being enchanted by the prospects of a &quot;gleaming future&quot; and hoped to give an optimistic look back at it. The title of &quot;Green Flower Street&quot; is a &quot;nod to the jazz standard &quot;On Green Dolphin Street.&quot; &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; is modeled after the Drifters&#x27; version of the song. For his rewrite of &quot;Ruby Baby&quot;, he listened to several records from the 1950s to &quot;get a general atmosphere of the period.&quot; &quot;Maxine&quot; references the harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and revolves around an &quot;extremely idealized version of high-school romance.&quot; The music was created from an Ed Greene drum track rescued from another song, where it wasn&#x27;t working.

&quot;New Frontier&quot; follows a &quot;gawky teenager&quot; inviting a girl back to his family&#x27;s backyard fallout shelter for a private gathering. &quot;The Nightfly&quot;, the title song, was once described by American novelist Arthur Phillips as a &quot;portrait of a late-night D.J. in Baton Rouge, taking lunatic phone calls from listeners while silently battling his own loneliness and regret.&quot; According to Fagen, the song &quot;uses a lot of images from the blues: that hair formula gets its name from Charley Patton, the old delta blues guitarist, and Mount Belzoni gets its name from another old blues lyric: &#x27;When the trial&#x27;s in Belzoni/No need to scream and cry.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The Goodbye Look&quot; alludes to the popularity of bossa nova in the 1960s. The song is a &quot;tale of military upheaval on a Caribbean island.&quot; The last song, &quot;Walk Between Raindrops&quot;, has origins in a Jewish folk tale. It was the last song to be recorded, and took form &quot;almost as an afterthought,&quot; according to writer Sweet.

== Artwork ==
The album&#x27;s cover artwork features a photo of Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16 inch &#x27;50s model, with a Para-Flux A-16 tonearm), an ashtray, a matchbook, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible on the table with the record player is the cover of the 1958 jazz album &quot;Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders&quot; (one of Fagen&#x27;s favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; shortly before the album&#x27;s release described the album cover: &quot;At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of &quot;The Nightfly&quot;&quot;. Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. &quot;It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it,&quot; he said. The cover was shot in Fagen&#x27;s apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover&#x27;s set design.

In his memoir, &quot;Eminent Hipsters&quot;, Fagen notes that the cover figure &quot;wasn&#x27;t supposed to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ,&quot; but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, &quot;Symphony Sid&quot; Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his &quot;main man&quot;, WEVD&#x27;s Mort Fega. &quot;He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you&#x27;d had.&quot; At the time of the album&#x27;s release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: &quot;When I saw &quot;&#x27;E.T.&quot;,&#x27; I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time, jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; Robert J. Toth writes, &quot;The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration.&quot; Robert Palmer, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, continued in this line of thinking: &quot;Inside, there&#x27;s a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He&#x27;s playing it softly, so his parents won&#x27;t wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;The Nightfly&quot; was released on October 1, 1982, on vinyl and cassette. It was also released in its first prerecorded digital form, via half-inch Beta and VHS format cassettes issued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. In addition, a matching folio for the album was released by Cherry Lane Music in February 1983. It was first widely available on compact disc in 1984; a reader&#x27;s poll conducted by &quot;Digital Audio&quot; magazine the following year ranked it among the best releases of the time, alongside &quot;Security&quot; (1982) by Peter Gabriel (another fully digital recording) and Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984). Early CD copies, however, suffered from being manufactured from third and fourth generation masters. Nichols discovered this when he received a call from Stevie Wonder, who told him that his CD copy of &quot;The Nightfly&quot; sounded &quot;funny.&quot; Nichols penned an essay in &quot;Recording Engineer and Producer&quot;, criticizing record companies&#x27; apparent carelessness in manufacturing the then-nascent format. &quot;The Nightfly&quot; was reissued on various disc formats four times in recent years, each time with a multichannel mix: on DVD-Audio in 2002, on DualDisc in 2004, on MVI in 2007 and on hybrid multichannel SACD in The Warner Premium Sound series by Warner Japan in 2011.

Following completion of the album, Fagen entered therapy and more-or-less dropped out of public sight. In his memoir, &quot;Eminent Hipsters&quot;, he writes that &quot;the panic attacks I used to get as a kid returned, only now accompanied by morbid thoughts and paranoia, big-time.&quot; He remained paralyzed for much of the rest of the 1980s, &quot;gobbling antidepressants&quot; and nearly unable to get through each day. He came to view &quot;The Nightfly&quot; as the culmination of &quot;whatever kind of energy was behind the writing I had been doing in the &#x27;70s.&quot; He turned down requests for television performances, opting only for radio and press interviews. Though he suggested he may do smaller concerts in New York, Fagen did not tour behind &quot;The Nightfly&quot;. He expounded upon his mental state after the album&#x27;s completion:

In 2006, Fagen maintained that &quot;I haven&#x27;t listened to &quot;The Nightfly&quot; since I made it.&quot;

Since resuming as a touring band in 1993, Steely Dan has performed several songs from &quot;The Nightfly&quot; on occasion; Fagen also did as a solo artist during a 2006 tour in support of his third solo album, &quot;Morph the Cat&quot;. Steely Dan — now with Fagen as the sole original member following Walter Becker&#x27;s death in 2017 — performed &quot;The Nightfly&quot; in its entirety at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and Orpheum Theater in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2019. An official live recording compiled from these performances, &quot;Donald Fagen&#x27;s The Nightfly Live&quot;, was released in 2021.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;The Nightfly&quot; was met with near universal acclaim. &quot;Billboard&quot; labeled it their top album pick in the first month of its release, calling it a &quot;stunning debut&quot; and praising its &quot;typically blue chip crew of crack players and crisp digital production.&quot; David Fricke wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;Donald Fagen conjures a world where all things are possible, even to a kid locked in his bedroom.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, gave the album an A and commented, &quot;these songs are among Fagen&#x27;s finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics put the jazziest music he&#x27;s ever committed to vinyl into a context that like everything here is loving but very clear-eyed.&quot; Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;vivid and frequently ingenious look back at a world that is gone forever. Its sound is glossy and contemporary, but references to both the spirit and the music of the years when Mr. Fagen was growing up can be found in almost every song.&quot; Charles Shaar Murray of &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;The Nightfly&quot; &quot;an album which doesn&#x27;t so much dilute the arctic smartassery of the Dan as warm it up, loosen it up, and present it in a new context.&quot; But in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Howard Hampton tempered his praise. While he loved the song &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; (&quot;an infectious ode&quot;), he felt that &quot;The rest of &quot;The Nightfly&quot;, though exceptional in places, just hasn&#x27;t that transcendental kick of this song.&quot; The sole poor review came from Paul Strange at &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, who dubbed the album a &quot;bummer. What made the Dan an important band of the early &#x27;70s has been replaced by ultra-slick, uninspired background mush.&quot;

Subsequent reviews have remained positive. Jon Matsumoto picked it for a &quot;Classic of the Week&quot; editorial in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1994, calling it an &quot;elegant pop album,&quot; praising the album&#x27;s &quot;vivid lyrical tapestry&quot; and &quot;rhythmically effervescent&quot; music. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic regarded &quot;The Nightfly&quot; as a continuation of &quot;the smooth pop-jazz mode favored on the final Steely Dan records&quot;, as well as &quot;lush and shimmering, produced with cinematic flair by Gary Katz; romanticized but never sentimental... crafted with impeccable style and sophistication.&quot; Bud Scoppa, in a review of the &quot;Nightfly&quot; trilogy (a reissue of Fagen&#x27;s first three studio albums), wrote that they are &quot;united not just by their sophistication but also by a sense of nostalgia for what has been irretrievably lost.&quot; &quot;The Nightfly&quot; is described as a &quot;superb jazz-pop solo album&quot; in Pete Prown and HP Newquist&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Legends of Rock Guitar&quot;. Jazz historian Ted Gioia cites it as an example of Steely Dan &quot;proving that pop-rock could equally benefit from a healthy dose of jazz&quot; during their original tenure, which coincided with a period when rock musicians frequently experimented with jazz idioms and techniques.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;The Nightfly&quot; was nominated for seven awards at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards in 1983, including Album of the Year and Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical. &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; received the most nominations, included on lists for Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s), while &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; received a nod for Best Vocal Arrangement. In addition, Gary Katz was nominated for Producer of the Year. In 2000, it was voted number 288 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, and in 2006, it was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2010, Vatican City&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; selected &quot;The Nightfly&quot; as one of its official Top 10 Albums.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;The Nightfly&quot; debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Albums chart at number 39 during the week ending October 23, 1982, peaking at number 25 on November 13. It debuted on the magazine&#x27;s all-genre Top LPs and Tape chart on October 30 at number 45; it climbed to number 11, its peak, on November 27. It also charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Black LPs chart, peaking at number 24. Internationally, the album charted higher: in Norway, it reached number seven on the charts. In Sweden and New Zealand, the album peaked at numbers eight and nine, respectively. &quot;The Nightfly&quot; performed more poorly than &quot;Gaucho&quot; commercially; Fagen felt as though the label did not market the album properly or effectively. WBCN in Boston, inspired by the album cover, developed a promotion in which listeners could register to host their own radio show.

== Legacy ==
The album remains a favorite among audiophiles. According to Paul Tingen of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, &quot;The Nightfly&quot; was &quot;for years a popular demonstration record in hi-fi stores across the globe&quot;. Paul White, editor-in-chief of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, said &quot;The Nightfly&quot; &quot;is always a good reference for checking out monitoring systems and shows what good results could be obtained from those early digital recording systems in the right hands&quot;. In addition to its use in recording studio tests, Clive Young of &quot;Pro Sound News&quot; called Fagen&#x27;s &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; the &quot;Free Bird&quot; of pro audio, claiming that almost every live sound engineer uses the song to test the front-of-house system&#x27;s sound response. &quot;EQ Magazine&quot; rated &quot;The Nightfly&quot; as among the Top 10 Best Recorded Albums of All Time, alongside the Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

<text>Richmond Castle in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England, stands in a commanding position above the River Swale, close to the centre of the town of Richmond. It was originally called Riche Mount, &#x27;the strong hill&#x27;. The castle was constructed by Alan Rufus from 1071 onwards following the Norman Conquest of England, and the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 refers to &#x27;a castlery&#x27; at Richmond.

In the 12th century, his great-nephew Conan expanded the castle and built the keep. Although it was derelict by 1540, it was restored centuries later. The property is the best-preserved early Norman castle in England and an important tourist attraction.

==Layout==

Richmond Castle consists of four main parts: a triangular main enclosure, an outer enclosure to the east, a keep at the northern corner of the main enclosure, and a small enclosure around the keep.

==History==

In 1069 William the Conqueror had put down a rebellion at York which was followed by his &quot;harrying of the North&quot; – an act of ethnic cleansing which depopulated large areas for a generation or more. As a further punishment, he divided up the lands of North Yorkshire among his most loyal followers. Alan Rufus, of Brittany, received the borough of Richmond and began constructing the castle to defend against further rebellions and to establish a personal power base. His holdings, called the Honour of Richmond, covered parts of eight counties and amounted to one of the most extensive Norman estates in England.

A -high keep of honey-coloured sandstone was constructed at the end of the 12th century by Duke Conan IV of Brittany. The Earldom of Richmond was seized in 1158 by Henry II of England. It was King Henry II who probably completed the keep which had -thick walls. Modern visitors can climb to the top of the keep for of the town of Richmond. At the same time that the keep was probably completed, Henry II considerably strengthened the castle by adding towers and a barbican. Henry III and King Edward I spent more money on the site including Edward&#x27;s improvements to the keep interior.

In addition to the main circuit of the wall, there was the barbican in front of the main gate which functioned as a sealed entry space, allowing visitors and wagons to be checked before they gained entry to the castle itself. On the other side of the castle, overlooking the river, was another enclosure or bailey called the Cockpit, which may have functioned as a garden and was overlooked by a balcony. A drawing of 1674 suggests there was another longer balcony overlooking the river side of Scolland&#x27;s Hall, the great hall.
Richmond Castle had fallen out of use as a fortress by the end of the 14th century and it did not receive major improvements after that date. A survey of 1538 shows it was partly in ruins, but paintings by Turner and others, together with the rise of tourism and an interest in antiquities, led to repairs to the keep in the early 19th century.

In 1855 the castle became the headquarters of the North Yorkshire Militia, and a military barracks block was constructed in the great courtyard. For two years, from 1908 to 1910, the castle was the home of Robert Baden-Powell, later founder of the Boy Scouts, while he commanded the Northern Territorial Army but the barracks building was demolished in 1931. 

The castle was used during the First World War as the base of the Non-Combatant Corps made up of conscientious objectors – conscripts who refused to fight. It was also used to imprison some conscientious objectors who refused to accept army discipline and participate in the war in any way. These included the &quot;Richmond Sixteen&quot; who were taken to France from the castle, charged under Field Regulations, and then sentenced to death, but their death sentences were commuted to ten years&#x27; hard labour.
The original 11th-century main gate arch is now in the basement of the later 12th century keep which was built in front of it; the original arch was unblocked in the 19th century.

The castle is a scheduled monument, a &quot;nationally important&quot; historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building.

According to legend, King Arthur and his knights are sleeping in a cave underneath the castle. It is said that they were once discovered by a potter named Thompson, who ran away when they began to awake. Another legend tells that a drummer boy was lost while investigating a tunnel, and that his ghostly drumming is sometimes heard around the castle.

== Graffiti ==
The cell block at the castle contains 2,300 examples of graffiti left by those imprisoned there, from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1970s. Perhaps the most significant of the mark makers were the Richmond Sixteen, who were conscientious objectors imprisoned there during the First World War.

<doc id="1120623" wikidata="Q7732361" url="?curid=1120623" title="The Equitable Life Assurance Society">
<text>The Equitable Life Assurance Society (Equitable Life), founded in 1762, is a life insurance company in the United Kingdom. The world&#x27;s oldest mutual insurer, it pioneered age-based premiums based on mortality rate, laying &quot;the framework for scientific insurance practice and development&quot; and &quot;the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based&quot;. After closing to new business in 2000, parts of the business were sold off and the remainder of the company became a subsidiary of Utmost Life and Pensions in January 2020.

At its peak in the 1990s, Equitable had 1.5 million policyholders with funds worth £26 billion under management, but it had allowed large unhedged liabilities to accumulate in respect of guaranteed fixed returns to investors without making provision for adverse market changes. Many policyholders lost half their life savings, and the company came close to collapse.

Following a July 2000 House of Lords ruling and the failure of attempts to find a buyer for the business, it closed to new business in December 2000 and reduced payouts to existing members. Lord Penrose&#x27;s 2004 Equitable Life Inquiry found that the company had made over-generous payouts leading it to be under-funded. A 2007 European report concluded that regulators had focused on solvency margins and failed to consider the increasing risk of accrued terminal bonuses. In 2010, government announced compensation to policy-holders of £1.5bn.

In June 2018, Equitable Life announced that Life Company Consolidation Group (now Utmost Life and Pensions) had agreed to buy the company for £1.8bn, with most policies to be transferred to Utmost&#x27;s Reliance Life subsidiary and converted to unit-linked. Some of the proceeds of the sale would be returned to the remaining 400,000 policyholders in the form of increased bonuses on their policies. The sale completed at the end of 2019.

== History ==
The society, established via a deed of trust in September 1762 with the name of the &quot;Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships&quot;, offered both whole life and fixed term policies. Premiums, which were constant for the duration of the policy, were based on a method devised by the mathematician James Dodson using mortality figures for Northampton and the amount payable on death, the basic sum assured, was guaranteed, a major advantage at the time.
As Dodson had died five years earlier, Edward Rowe Mores became its chief executive officer with the title of actuary—the first use of the term—though he was an administrator rather than a statistician.
The first modern actuary, William Morgan, was appointed in 1775 and served until 1830. In 1776 the Society carried out the first actuarial valuation of liabilities and subsequently distributed the first reversionary bonus (1781) and interim bonus (1809) among its members. It also used regular valuations to balance competing interests. Its products therefore met the description of a modern with-profits policy.

The society sought to treat its members equitably and the directors tried to ensure that the policyholders received a fair return on their respective investments. Throughout the society&#x27;s history, the allocation of bonuses (at regular intervals of up to five years) was a carefully thought-through decision based on actuarial advice, designed to promote fairness and equity between different groups and generations of policyholders.

Its methods were successful enough for it to be able to reduce its premiums by 10% in 1777, and there was a further reduction in 1781. By 1799 the society had assets of £4m and its 5,000 membership subsequently doubled to 10,000 in 1810. Famous 19th-century policyholders included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wilberforce and Sir Walter Scott.

The Life Assurance Companies Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 61) was passed, &quot;requiring all life offices to publish financial data on the lines so long followed by the Equitable.&quot;

In the 20th century, Henry Manly devised the concept and theory of staff pensions, which the society marketed from 1913. Pensions became available to the self-employed in 1957 when the society launched the Retirement annuity plan. Corporate pension scheme members included employees of the NHS, Unilever and the Post Office.

===Organisation===
The society&#x27;s first offices were in the parsonage of St Nicholas Acons in Nicholas Lane, London, moving to Blackfriars in 1774. Approval of policies, the main business of the Society, was undertaken by the Court of Directors; whilst resolutions had to be approved at two meetings of the General Court which all members were entitled to attend. From 1786 this court also dealt with grievances, and there was early tension between initial subscribers wanting a return on investment and those wanting to recruit new members. In 1816 a waiting period was introduced for new members, and only the oldest 5,000 policies were entitled to bonuses. In 1893 the memorandum and articles of association were adopted, incorporating the society as &quot;The Equitable Life Assurance Society&quot; and transferring power to the directors; the 1816 membership and bonus restrictions were removed.

The society moved to Mansion House Street in 1863, Coleman Street in 1924 (both in the City of London) and new offices in Aylesbury in January 1983. The archives of the society from 1762 to 1975 are held by the Institute of Actuaries.

The society acquired the University Life Assurance Society and the Reversionary Interest Society in 1919 and the Equitable Reversionary Interest Society in 1920.

==Guaranteed Annuity Rates, Article 65 and the 1999 Hyman case==
Many of Equitable&#x27;s with-profits policies were designed to provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.
Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder&#x27;s lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee.

In 1979, legislation allowed the lump sum to be transferred to another annuity provider. As a result, communications with policyholders increasingly focused on the lump sum rather than annuity benefits.

The GAR was calculated using an interest yield of 4% per annum until 1975 when it was increased to 7%. By May 2001, of Equitable&#x27;s 1.1m policyholders about 16% held a GAR option.

During the 1980s and 1990s Equitable experienced a further period of rapid growth. It developed market-leading personal pension and additional voluntary contribution plans while maintaining its record of operating with one of the lowest expense ratios in the industry. Its success was &quot;partly based on its reputation, its strategy of paying no commissions to insurance agents or independent advisers and its tactic of always keeping reserves low and returning to its members more money than other companies&quot;.

In 1993 the CAR fell below the guaranteed annuity rate, thus prompting GAR policyholders to exercise their rights. According to actuary Christopher Headdon, policies issued from 1975 to 1988 were worth approximately 25% more than CARs; the total difference amounted to some £1 billion to £1.5 billion.

Based on an affidavit sworn by Christopher Headdon on 28 June 1999, &quot;from the 1980s onwards, Equitable was aware of the GAR risk. ... At no time did Equitable ever hedge or reinsure adequately against the GAR risk to counteract it. The reason for this was Equitable&#x27;s belief that it could ... neutralise the potential effect of the GAR risk through the exercise of its discretion to allocate final bonuses under Article 65&quot; (of the Articles of Association).

In 1994, Equitable exercised its discretion under that Article to reduce the terminal bonus of those policies with Guaranteed Annuity Rates, negating the benefit from the guarantee but preserving the assets of non-GAR policyholders.

By July 1998 there were a number of complaints to the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman and it was decided to seek a declaratory judgment. David Hyman was selected as the representative policyholder. Hearings started in July 1999, and in September the High Court ruled in the Equitable&#x27;s favour; but this was reversed by the Appeal Court in January 2000. The Equitable now sought a ruling by the House of Lords.

===House of Lords ruling on the Hyman case===

On 20 July 2000 the House of Lords upheld the Appeal Court ruling. They concluded that GAR policies required that the guaranteed rate was applied to calculate the contractual annuity; and that the effect of the differential terminal bonus rates was that the annuity was calculated at current annuity rates, not at the guaranteed rate, and was not lawful. &quot;The self-evident commercial object of the inclusion of guaranteed rates in the policy is to protect the policyholder against a fall in market annuity rates ... The supposition of the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors would not exercise their discretion [in Article 65] in conflict with contractual rights.&quot;

Even before that stage, Equitable, which had long claimed to be more transparent than its rivals, had assets worth £3 billion less than communications with policyholders had indicated.

==Aftermath of the Hyman case and partial sales, 2001–9==

Having not insured against losing the case, and with no other way to make provision for the immediate £1.5 billion increase in long-term liabilities, Equitable put itself up for sale. By the end of July, about ten companies, including the Prudential, had considered, but rejected a bid. Equitable had intended using money from the sale to allocate bonuses for the first seven months of 2000, but now this was not available.

On 8 December 2000 it closed to new business, and immediately set a Market Value Adjustment of 10% which was later increased to 15%.

On 19 December, HM Treasury announced a review of the Financial Services Authority (FSA)&#x27;s regulation of Equitable. The following day, Equitable announced that their President and seven non-executive directors would step down. Vanni Treves became Chairman in March 2001, with Charles Thomson as Chief Executive.

On 4 February 2001 the Halifax agreed to buy Equitable&#x27;s operating assets, salesforce and non-profit business for a payment of up to £1 billion into the with-profits fund, subject to policyholder agreement. On 20 September 2001, compromise proposals were published offering 17.5% increase for GARs in exchange for the guarantee and 2.5% for non-GARs in exchange for abandoning any legal claim. The deal was accepted by 98% of GAR policyholders, and was sanctioned by the High Court in February 2002.

Both groups of policyholders (those whose pensions had vested and those that had not) received further bad news. In July 2001 deferred pensioners (the second group) were angered to be told their savings had been reduced by 16%, and then in November 2002 pensioners were told that &quot;with-profits annuities, like yours, are now out of line by about 30%.&quot; 50,000 annuitants suffered a 20% reduction in income.

In February 2007, Equitable completed the transfer of £4.6 billion of annuities to Canada Life, and in November transferred all £1.8 billion of with-profits annuity policies to Prudential, a deal accepted by 98% of members voting at a meeting.

In November 2008, Equitable announced that the sale of the Society would be put on hold and that the Board would instead review the arrangements to run off its existing business. Gross assets as of December 2008 were £8,754 million, around 25% of the value in 2000.

Treves stepped down as chairman in September 2009 and was replaced by Ian Brimecome.

==2001 reports by the actuarial profession and FSA==

In May 2001, Ian Glick QC and Richard Snowden published their joint opinion on behalf of the Financial Services Authority. This concluded that there was an arguable case that the Equitable had breached the rules of its former regulators, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) and the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) in failing to disclose the risk of the existing GAR policies in the Product Particulars, Key Features and With-Profits Guide to new non-GAR policy holders.

This was followed in September by the Corley Report on behalf of the Institute of Actuaries, which recommended, amongst other things, that the Appointed Actuary should require that there is a process for reviewing communications to policyholders, and should resist holding a dual role as Chief Executive, and that his work should be subject to peer review.

In October, the Baird Report was published. This covered the Financial Services Authority&#x27;s regulation of Equitable from 1 January 1999 to 8 December 2000, when the Society closed to new business. The report was produced by the FSA&#x27;s director of internal audit with the help of independent accountants and lawyers. The review found that – with hindsight – there had been some &quot;deficiencies&quot; on the part of the FSA in the discharge of their regulatory responsibilities, but also stated that &quot;the die had been cast&quot; by the time the FSA had assumed regulatory responsibility for the Society, in relation to those who had already invested in Equitable.

==The Penrose report, 2004==
The Penrose report, commissioned by the Treasury in August 2001 and expected in 2002, was finally published in March 2004 after delays due to vetting by Treasury lawyers. The 818-page report found that the company had made over-generous payouts to policyholders, reaching the stage where &quot;The Society was under-funded to the extent of £4½ billion in the summer of 2001&quot; (chapter 19, para 82). Penrose said: &quot;Principally, the Society was author of its own misfortunes. Regulatory system failures were secondary factors&quot;. He also accused the former Equitable management team of &quot;dubious&quot; practices and nurturing a &quot;culture of manipulation and concealment&quot;. The Report was debated in parliament on 24 March 2004.

==European Parliament investigation, 2007==
In June 2007 the European Parliament issued a 385-page report on Equitable Life. Its fifteen-month investigation followed the implementation in July 2004 of EC Directive 92/96/EEC (the Third Life Directive or 3LD), which governs the single market in life insurance. This directive required the UK, where Equitable&#x27;s headquarters were, to supervise its &quot;entire business&quot;, and curtailed the supervisory power of other EU countries where Equitable operated.

The EU Parliament&#x27;s remit was to investigate, without prejudice, alleged breaches of Community law in relation to the collapse, to assess the UK regulatory regime in respect of Equitable Life, and to look at the adequacy of remedies available to policyholders including the 15,000 non-UK members. The 22-member committee heard evidence from 38 witnesses and analysed 92 public documents, and its report is the only one completely independent of UK Government influence. Whilst a detailed summary of the full document is well outside the scope of this article, an examination of the effectiveness of the supervision of Equitable is given below and closely follows the wording.
* Financial supervision covering the Assurance undertaking&#x27;s entire business.

The evidence suggests that the regulator focused exclusively on solvency margins, and took little or no account of accrued terminal bonuses in its overall analysis of the financial health of the company. It quotes Penrose as saying that the Policyholders&#x27; Reasonable Expectations (PRE) would have included terminal bonus even if the amount was not defined; however the Government Actuary&#x27;s Department (GAD) and the Treasury deny PRE existed as the terminal bonus was not guaranteed.

The report goes on to say that if it is considered that these types of bonuses are an integral part of the company&#x27;s &quot;entire business&quot;, the regulatory authorities should have taken them into account. Although the regulator was given the option of not forcing Equitable to build reserves for discretionary bonuses, that did not absolve the authorities from their duty of financial supervision covering the &quot;assurance undertaking&#x27;s entire business&quot;.

* Every insurance company is required to have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms. Though the Appointed Actuary (AA) is not a role required by the directive, it was an essential part of the UK&#x27;s own system of insurance regulation. Inter alia, the AA was required to act as a guardian of policyholders&#x27; interests; but the overall evidence suggests that &quot;the UK regulator did not fulfil its obligation ... in that Roy Ranson became CEO without relinquishing his role as the Appointed Actuary.&quot; The Treasury rejected this claim as the 3LD does not mention the AA.

The overall evidence received suggested that by not taking swift action on this matter, the UK regulator did not fulfil its obligation to require from Equitable sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms, as required explicitly.

* Ensure that the competent authorities have the powers and means necessary for the supervision of assurance undertakings.
The UK had the legal power to supervise Equitable. The Baird report stated that in January 1999, the total number of staff involved in the Government&#x27;s prudential regulation of about 200 insurance companies was less than 135.

The Penrose report also states that &quot;the DTI insurance division was ill equipped to participate in the regulatory process. It had inadequate staff and those involved at line supervisor level in particular were not qualified to make any significant contribution to the process. For all practical purposes, scrutiny of the actuarial functioning of life offices was in the hands of GAD until the reorganisation under FSA was in place&quot;. More evidence also strongly suggests that the regulator adopted a conscious and deliberate &quot;hands-off&quot; approach with regard to the Equitable case. If this were proven to be the case, it would constitute a breach of the regulator&#x27;s obligation to ensure the respect of PRE and therefore a breach of the letter and aim of Article 10 of the 3LD. Both the Baird and Penrose reports contain criticisms of the regulator&#x27;s lack of a &quot;pro-active approach&quot;.

In its conclusion on p. 117, the report said that the powers bestowed on the Secretary of State (as prescribed by Section 68 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982) to waive the application of prudential regulations appear to be incompatible with the letter and the aim of the Directive, and were used inappropriately (particularly when granting authorisation on numerous occasions to include future profits in the assets available to meet the solvency margin), and that therefore ... there are serious concerns that the 3LD was not correctly transposed in full.

&quot;The committee is of the opinion that the application of the 3LD by the UK in respect of the ELAS case was deficient and that UK regulators and authorities did not adequately respect the ultimate purpose of the Directive.&quot;

==Legal actions by Equitable Life, 2005==

In April 2005, in the light of Penrose&#x27;s findings, Equitable started a £2 billion High Court action against auditors Ernst &amp; Young, reduced 3 months later to £0.7 billion, claiming they had failed to inform the directors of the seriousness of its position. However lawyers advised they could not prove that correct advice would have changed the outcome, and the case was dropped in September. Ernst &amp; Young described the case as &quot;ill conceived&quot;. Simultaneously, Equitable started a £3.3 billion claim against former directors, claiming that they failed in their duties to policyholders. This claim was abandoned in December 2005; the costs of the two cases amounted to around £40m.

==Government response and the Parliamentary Ombudsman, 2008–09==

In July 2008, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman completed a four-year investigation, described by Equitable&#x27;s chief executive as the &quot;best chance of compensation&quot;. Her 2,819-page report accused the regulators, i.e. the DTI, GAD, and FSA, of &quot;comprehensive failure&quot;, found the Government guilty of ten counts of maladministration, and called for a compensation scheme &quot;to put those people who have suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in, had maladministration not occurred&quot;. Equitable&#x27;s chairman estimated that 30,000 policyholders had already died without receiving compensation. In December, the European Parliament issued a press release describing the regulatory failure as an outrage.

In January 2009 the Government issued their response and appointed retired judge Sir John Chadwick as an independent advisor to design an ex-gratia scheme for some policyholders &quot;who have suffered a disproportionate impact as a result of the relevant maladministration&quot;.

The Ombudsman accused the government of twisting the findings of her report by suggesting that whatever the regulators had done, it would have made no difference to the events which followed. She also said it had failed to give &quot;cogent reasons&quot; for rejecting some of her findings, mandatory since the Pensions Action Group Judicial Review. In March, the Public Administration Select Committee issued a second report in which it described the government response as &quot;morally unacceptable&quot;, and repeated the Ombudsman&#x27;s criticism that it had acted as judge on its own behalf.

In May, the Ombudsman issued a supplementary report to the government&#x27;s reply. In August 2009, Chadwick issued an interim report.

== Government response, 2010 ==

In the Queen&#x27;s Speech following the formation of a Conservative-LibDem coalition government in 2010, the Equitable Life (Payments) Bill was announced. The bill sought to secure compensation for nearly a million policyholders (UK-wide) hit by the near-collapse of the insurer. The Government also announced that the final report from Sir John Chadwick in relation to Equitable Life would be received by mid-July. A statement on the HM Treasury website confirmed two elements of the design of the scheme: that there should be no means testing, and that the dependents of deceased policyholders should be included in the scheme.

The July 2010 announcement by Mark Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, offered compensation starting by mid-2011 to 1.5m savers. However, policyholder compensation would be limited to the &quot;absolute loss they suffered&quot; estimated by Chadwick at a total of £2.3-£3B, compared with the £4B-£4.8B returns that similar companies produced, as calculated by consultants Towers Watson. Sir John, whose report was designed to compensate those who suffered &quot;disproportionately&quot;, recommended a payment cap for each policyholder which would reduce total compensation to between £400m and £500m. Hoban said compensation would follow recommendations of the Parliamentary Ombudsman report and would take Sir John&#x27;s findings into account, but might be affected by public spending cuts. Total compensation would be announced in the public spending review in October. Equitable Life pressure group EMAG were unhappy with the announcement but the Ombudsman said she would inform Parliament of her views once she had had time to consider the statement.

Although Equitable&#x27;s management initially welcomed the announcement, they were concerned that compensation would be based on the Chadwick report, written on the premise that only five of the Ombudsman&#x27;s findings of maladministration were valid. In opposition, Hoban had promised that all ten counts would be considered. Equitable&#x27;s Chief Executive, Chris Wiscarson, wrote to Hoban saying that they could not support Chadwick&#x27;s recommendations as they would only cover about 10% of losses and that compensation should be based on a total figure of £4.8B.

On 20 October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Spending Review Statement that the compensation package would be around £1.5billion. However, in 2013, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said that 200,000 people could miss out because of a lack of publicity ahead of the 2014 deadline. The report called on the Treasury and its administrator, National Savings and Investments, to &quot;get their act together&quot; and bring forward publicity for the deadline to July rather than September 2013. By March 2012, payments were only one third of that expected and Committee chairman Margaret Hodge also criticized the Treasury for destroying details of 353,000 policyholders on data protection grounds. In response, a Government Treasury spokesman criticized the Labour party for ignoring the problem for ten years.

== Sale to Utmost, 2019 ==
In June 2018, Equitable Life announced that Life Company Consolidation Group (LCCG) had agreed to buy the company for £1.8bn, with policies to be transferred to LCCG&#x27;s Reliance Life subsidiary and converted to unit-linked. LCCG (now Utmost Life and Pensions) is backed by Oaktree Capital Management and specialises in buying insurance businesses that are closed to new customers. Some of the proceeds of the sale would be returned to the remaining 400,000 policyholders in the form of increased bonuses on their policies.

The sale required approval by policyholders and the High Court, and, having received this, completed at the end of 2019, with UK policies transferring to Utmost Life and Pensions. Irish and German policies remain with the Equitable Life, now a subsidiary of Utmost Life and Pensions.

<doc id="1120631" wikidata="Q7059437" url="?curid=1120631" title="Northgate, West Sussex">
<text>Northgate is one of the 14 residential neighbourhoods in Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Crawley was planned and laid out as a New Town after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings. Northgate was one of the four in the &quot;inner ring&quot; closest to the town centre, and was the second to be completed: almost all building work on the site took place in the first half of the 1950s.

Northgate is bordered by West Green to the west, Langley Green to the north, Three Bridges to the east and the town centre and Southgate to the south. It is one of the smaller neighbourhoods in the town, but has the standard range of buildings as proposed in the 1940s masterplan: churches, a pub, a shopping parade, a primary school, and housing of various styles and layouts. Some older, pre-New Town buildings remain, including three with listed status and the locally listed Dyers Almshouses, which form part of the surviving interwar development in this part of the town.

==History==
For most of its history, Crawley was a slowly growing market town whose focus was the north–south High Street, part of the main London to Brighton road. This was turnpiked in 1770, and at the northern and southern limits of the parish tollgates were erected—the North Gate and the South Gate. The section of road north of Crawley, called London Road, was widened in the early 1930s and bypassed a few years later to form the present A23. The tollgate was close to Boscobel House, a 17th-century timber-framed house which is now a listed building, and a long-established coaching inn called the Rising Sun. In the New Town era the inn was converted into a restaurant and later demolished, along with most of the other buildings along this section of London Road (including a public hall called Victoria Hall and a London Transport bus garage).

The area now covered by the Northgate neighbourhood was, until World War II, an area of mostly open land lying northeast of the town centre, whose focus was still the ancient High Street and its northward continuation London Road. Much of the area was covered by Woolborough Farm, part of the Crabbet Park estate which had been owned by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and his family. Most of the estate was auctioned in 1916. The farm and its facilities were described in the auction catalogue as comprising &quot;a picturesque farmhouse, two cottages and homestead of agricultural buildings, together with of arable land, of well-timbered and shaded pastures and cool meadows, [and] two pieces of woodland&quot;. None of this survives, apart from in the name of Woolborough Road: postwar housing now covers the land.
The fields of the Crabbet Park estate were interspersed with allotments, and after the estate was broken up some housing was built, mostly directly off the London Road: Tushmore Lane, Cobbles Crescent and Woolborough Road had interwar ribbon development, there was some opposite The Sun Inn at the south end of London Road before it became Crawley High Street, and some &quot;typical 1930s housing&quot; on Green Lane. Altogether, 229 houses existed in the designated area at the start of World War II. A group of almshouses were built in 1939–40 on Northgate Road for the Worshipful Company of Dyers, a London livery company, which had moved from an older building in Islington.

Crawley was designated as a New Town in January 1947 after the New Towns Act 1946 identified it as a suitable site for one. Crawley Development Corporation was formed, led by the architect Thomas Bennett, and planner Anthony Minoprio provided a master plan for the town&#x27;s development. He proposed a double ring of nine neighbourhoods surrounding an extended town centre. Northgate was to form the northern part of the inner ring, between the town centre and the northern section of the planned Crawley ring road.

Crawley Development Corporation&#x27;s second annual report (1949) stated that Northgate was the second planned neighbourhood of nine, after West Green. Although 13 neighbourhoods were built in the end, the order of construction of the early neighbourhoods remained unchanged. Work got underway in 1950, when 162 houses were built. A higher proportion of flats was provided than elsewhere in Crawley: one-quarter of the residential units built in the early years were flats, and flats eventually made up 13% of Northgate&#x27;s housing stock overall. Crawley Development Corporation also built 142 concrete houses, unique in the town, in 1955.

Each New Town neighbourhood was to have a &quot;neighbourhood centre&quot; with shops, one or more churches, a pub, a primary school and a community centre. Work started on Northgate&#x27;s in 1952 and the 13 shops were completed in 1953. Northgate suffered from the same problems and inconveniences in its first years as the other early neighbourhoods. No pavements were provided; streets lacked lighting and were either dusty or muddy; and potholes were common. There were also design errors at the main shopping parade: the pillar box was erected outside a chemist&#x27;s shop instead of the post office, and all of the flats above the shops were mistakenly given the same door lock and key.

Queen Elizabeth II visited Crawley in June 1958, principally to open Gatwick Airport; but she visited Northgate and toured the Territorial Army centre in Kilnmead among other places.

==Location within Crawley==
The designated area of Crawley New Town according to Anthony Minoprio&#x27;s masterplan was , of which was to be developed at first. Northgate was to cover immediately north of the expanded town centre. Anticlockwise from the south, the neighbourhood is bounded by The Boulevard (forming the northern limit of the town centre), Northgate Avenue (the A2004), Crawley Avenue (the A2011) and London Road, historically the main north–south route through the town but now bypassed and downgraded.

When the New Town was planned, each neighbourhood was allocated a colour, which appears on street name signs together with the neighbourhood&#x27;s name. Northgate&#x27;s colour is pine green.

==Governance==
When Crawley Urban District was formed in May 1956, it was divided into eight wards whose boundaries were identical with those of eight of the extant and planned neighbourhoods. By 1983, nine years after the district became a borough, the town had thirteen wards. This position remained the same until an electoral review in 2002, which created two new wards. Throughout these changes, Northgate&#x27;s ward boundaries remained the same. As well as the residential part of the neighbourhood, they cover the town centre to the south and the Manor Royal industrial estate to the north. The ward elects two councillors. In 2002 it was stated that the electorate in Northgate was 3,515 people, rising to an expected 3,918 in 2006; this made it one of the smallest wards in the town.

==Demography==
The administrative ward of Northgate covers the residential neighbourhood, the town centre and Manor Royal industrial estate. Wards are used for collecting census and other statistical and demographic data. Northgate&#x27;s population was 5,298 at the time of the 2011 United Kingdom census. The ward covers , giving a population density of , but much of the area covered by the ward is non-residential. At the time of the 2011 census Crawley as a whole had 106,597 residents and a population density of .

At the census date there were 2,259 households in Northgate, of which 1,041 (46%) were owned by the occupier, 592 (26%) were rented from Crawley Borough Council or another public-sector landlord, 550 (24%) were rented privately and 33 (1.5%) were occupied rent-free. These proportions were significantly different from the housing tenure mix of Crawley as a whole, where 59% of residences were owned by the occupier, 24% were socially rented (from the council or another public body), 14.5% were privately rented and 1.2% were occupied rent-free. Housing types in Northgate were also different from in Crawley as a whole. Detached, semi-detached and terraced houses made up 8.3%, 17% and 38.4% respectively of the housing in Northgate, 32.9% of residences were flats in purpose-blocks, 2% were flats above commercial premises, and 1.3% were converted premises such as bedsits. In Crawley overall, detached, semi-detached and terraced houses made up 13.9%, 20.7% and 41.6% of the housing stock respectively; 22.3% of residences were in purpose-built flats; 0.5% were flats above commercial premises, and 0.9% were converted premises of other types.

According to the census, 74% of Northgate residents were White, 18.9% were Asian or Asian-British, 3.2% were Black or Black-British, 2.6% were mixed-race and 1.2% were from another ethnic background. The proportion of white people was lower, and that of Asian people higher, than in Crawley overall; other proportions were comparable to Crawley as a whole. Northgate&#x27;s age profile at the census date was slightly older than that of Crawley as a whole, in common with the other inner neighbourhoods: 19.1% of residents were under 18 years old, 21.8% were between 18 and 29 years old, 41.4% were between 30 and 59, and 17.8% were 60 or older. The corresponding proportions for the borough overall were 23.3%, 17.1%, 42.3% and 17.4%. The mean and median ages were both about one year higher in Northgate than in Crawley as a whole.

Northgate was the second of the three earliest New Town neighbourhoods, all of which &quot;were intended to house the builders of the New Town and the earliest unskilled settlers&quot;. The mix of occupations in the neighbourhood still reflects this: there are lower proportions of residents working in the highest categories of the census-defined hierarchy of occupations, and higher proportions in the lowest categories, than in the borough as a whole.

==Buildings and facilities==

St Elizabeth&#x27;s Church was built in 1958 for Northgate&#x27;s Anglican worshippers. It was part of the parish of St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Crawley. The building was extended in the mid-1960s. It is a simple brick hall with windows in the clerestory and a small flèche on the roof. Its role as a church has been downgraded since 2005, when weekly services ceased; occasional services are still held, but its principal use is now by New Generation Performing Arts, formerly the Louise Ryrie School of Dance and Drama. The parish of St Richard&#x27;s Church, Three Bridges now covers Northgate and is involved with New Generation, which it describes as &quot;a Christian performing arts group for children and young people&quot;. Crawley&#x27;s main Methodist church, St Paul&#x27;s, was built in the neighbourhood centre in 1953–55. A new church was built alongside in 1966 and the original building became the church hall. The 1966 building is polygonal and has a multi-gabled copper roof. There is exposed timberwork inside. A Kingdom Hall was built for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses on a nearby site in 1983. It was registered for worship in April 1983 (originally on behalf of the Ifield Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) and for marriages in 1991.

Separate infants and junior schools were opened by West Sussex County Council in 1954, replacing a temporary school provided two years previously. They became a first school and a middle school respectively when education facilities in the town were reconfigured in 1971. Like the other New Town schools, it was designed by West Sussex county architect F.R. Steele. The schools have now been amalgamated into one entity called Northgate Primary School; it takes children from ages 3 (nursery class) to 11 (Year 6).

Many of the neighbourhood pubs made architectural reference to the Regency style and have been altered over the years. The example at Northgate, the Black Dog, has a &quot;jolly Regency bow&quot;. A temporary hut for community activities was built in Northgate by 1954; it was replaced by the present community centre, a permanent building, in 1963. The following year, its lease was one of the first to be taken on by the Crawley Council for Voluntary Service, which operated all the neighbourhoods&#x27; community centres by the mid-1980s. Also in 1964 a separate youth club building was erected.

There is a Territorial Army centre on Kilnmead. It is the battalion headquarters of 103 Battalion, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The building also houses an Army Careers Information Office.
==Heritage==
Three of the 100 listed buildings and structures in the borough of Crawley are in Northgate. Boscobel House is at the south end of London Road close to where it becomes Crawley High Street, very close to the former Northgate tollgate. The building, which is now an office, was built as a two-storey timber-framed cottage in the late 17th century and was given a brick and tile façade a century later. The roof is also tiled. Black Dog Cottage is a 16th-century farmhouse which retains its original timber framing, although it was given a brick façade in the 19th century. Another original feature is the chimney, which sits on the steep tiled hipped roof. The rear elevation is weatherboarded. Fir Tree Cottage is another timber-framed building, although it is later: it was built in the late 17th or early 18th century. By 1792 it was in use as the Crawley parish workhouse. A mixture of brickwork, tiles, stucco and exposed timberwork can be seen on the exterior of the building, which (like Black Dog Cottage) is now a private house. It is on the east side of London Road.

There were 59 locally listed buildings in Crawley as of 2010, including one in Northgate. Dyers Almshouses are a &quot;charming&quot; complex of single-storey almshouses designed in the Arts and Crafts style by architect W.H. Hatchard-Smith of the Bertram &amp; Co. firm in 1939–40. Their prominent tiled gables are &quot;reminiscent of rural Dutch cottages&quot;, and each is topped with a large chimney. Only ten of the houses, which are set in a quadrangle around a garden, are original; another 16 were built to the same design in 1952, and four more were added in 1971. They were among the many buildings built in Crawley and the surrounding area by local building firm James Longley and Co. The buildings are also part of the Dyers Almshouses Conservation Area, one of 11 conservation areas in the borough.

==Transport==
Metrobus route 100, part of the Crawley Fastway network, runs through Northgate along Woodfield Road, calling at several stops in the neighbourhood. The route serves Maidenbower, Three Bridges, Crawley town centre, the Manor Royal industrial estate and business district, Lowfield Heath, Gatwick Airport and the Surrey towns of Horley and Redhill. Several stops along London Road, the western boundary of the neighbourhood, are served by routes 4 and 5 (Gatwick Airport–Lowfield Heath–Langley Green–Crawley town centre–Three Bridges–Pound Hill) and 10 (Gatwick Airport–Manor Royal–Crawley town centre–Southgate–Broadfield–Bewbush).

<text>Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên ( (born 30 June 1965) is a Vietnamese-American singer, songwriter, and master of ceremonies and co-host of &quot;Paris by Night&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kỳ Duyên was born on June 30, 1965, in Saigon, South Vietnam as the only daughter to Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, a former South Vietnamese Prime Minister, Vice President, and Air-Force General. Her father was from Sơn Tây and grew up in Hanoi. Her mother is Đặng Tuyết Mai who was from Bắc Ninh and also spent most of her childhood in Hanoi. Because of her parents&#x27; roots in Northern Vietnam, Kỳ Duyên speaks Vietnamese with a distinct Northern accent, despite growing up in the south. In 1953, Đặng Tuyết Mai and her family moved to Da Lat, South Vietnam, where she studied at Yersin High School, acquiring fluency in English and French. Before getting married, Đặng Tuyết Mai was one of four air hostesses for Air Vietnam. Đặng Tuyết Mai met Nguyễn Cao Kỳ on a trip from Manila to Vietnam. At around the age of ten during the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên moved to the United States.

When first moving to America, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên lived in Fairfax, Virginia, then later moved to Huntington Beach, California in which she studied at Marina High School. She enrolled for a law major at Western State College of Law at Argosy University and graduated with honors.

She learned piano since age 5. During the time when she was 13 to 19 years old, she learned music theory and vocal training. Her debut appearance was to host at Miss Ao Dai Competition in Long Beach, California. In 1984, she recorded her first music CD at Tung Giang Studio. In 1985, she debuted as a singer in Seattle, Washington, but her first recording was in 1993 for Hollywood Night Center. She often performs at Las Vegas, California and Paris.

Kỳ Duyên is currently a master of ceremonies for Thúy Nga Productions&#x27;s &quot;Paris by Night&quot; series alongside Nguyễn Ngọc Ngạn. Kỳ Duyên has shared that when she first began her career as an MC, she did not read and write in Vietnamese, so her mother helped her memorize her lines.

==Education==
Kỳ Duyên went to school in Fairfax, Virginia during her childhood, moving to Huntington Beach, California in her high school years, and graduating from Westminster High School in Westminster, California.

She received her Bachelor of Undergraduate Education degree at California State Polytechnic University, and later obtained her Graduate Law master&#x27;s degree with Honors from Western State University College of Law.

==Personal life==
Her first marriage was to Nguyễn Quang Li, a surgeon, then Trịnh Hội, a lawyer (whom she divorced in 2008). Following two marriages and two divorces, she fell in love with David Duy Han, a financial analyst and writer. She currently resides in Huntington Beach, California with her two daughters from her first marriage.

<text>Radio Ceylon ( &quot;Lanka Guwan Viduli Sevaya&quot;, , &quot;ilankai vanoli&quot;) is a radio station based in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) and the first radio station in Asia. Broadcasting was started on an experimental basis by the colonial Telegraph Department in 1923, just four years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe (the first European broadcasting radio station started on November 6, 1919 in The Hague, The Netherlands; it was operated by the Dutch Hans Henricus Schotanus à Steringa Idzerda).

== History ==
The history of Radio Ceylon dates back to 1925, when its first precursor, &quot;Colombo Radio&quot;, was launched on 16 December 1925 using a mediumwave radio transmitter of one kilowatt of output power from Welikada, Colombo. Commenced just 3 years after the launch of BBC, Colombo radio was the first radio station in Asia and the second oldest radio station in the world.

This new medium of mass communication not only became increasingly popular in the years that followed, but also quickly evolved into a medium of national character, which led to the &quot;Radio Service&quot; being organised as a separate department of the government of Ceylon (currently Sri Lanka) in 1949. Subsequently, in 1967, the Department of Broadcasting was transformed into its present statutory form of a state corporation by the Ceylon broadcasting corporation Act. No 37 of 1966 of the parliament of Ceylon, thereby assuring increased autonomy and flexibility in the operations of the new organization.

The organisation acquired its present name, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, with the transition of the state into the status of &quot;Republic of Sri Lanka&quot; on 22 May 1972. SLBC (Stands for Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) has since continued in the same legal status as a state corporation, and is currently listed under the scope of the ministry of Information and Media of the Government of Sri Lanka.

===Transition from AM to FM===
SLBC relied on mediumwave as its primary mode of domestic broadcasting until the 1990s. Some sporadic FM broadcasts were already introduced at several relay stations more as a means of expanding the broadcasts to medium wave repeater stations, however, by the late 1980s.

This was followed by the &#x27;Island FM Development Project&#x27; that was launched in year 1995. The objectives of the project were to develop an Islandwide multi-channel FM stereo broadcast transmission network and to divest the costly domestic medium wave transmitting stations, which were typically broadcasting only one or two programme channels per transmitting station. By 1999, more than 95% of country&#x27;s total population was being covered by SLBC&#x27;s FM transmissions with nearly 90% of them receiving all six nationwide channels.

==Radio services==
Currently, SLBC&#x27;s domestic FM network broadcasts 6 radio stations on a nationwide basis, which are:
*Sinhala Swadeshiya Sevaya&#x27; (Sinhala National Service)
*Tamil National Service
* English Service
*City FM (Sinhala)
*Velenda Sevaya&#x27; (Sinhala Commercial Service)
*Thendral (Tamil Commercial Service)

== Other services ==
Radio Ceylon had a Hindi service that was launched in the early 1950s. Millions of rupees in terms of advertising revenue came from India through the efforts of Dan Molina, Frank Courtney, and S. Hariharan. The three operated Radio Advertising Services as the advertising agents of Radio Ceylon. The station employed some of the most popular Indian announcers who played a vital role in establishing Radio Ceylon as the &#x27;King of the airwaves&#x27; in South Asia, among them, the Ganjwar sisters, Vimla and Kamini, Vijay Kishore Dubey, Gopal Sharma, Rakesh Sharma, Hasan Razvi, Kumar and Manohar Mahajan, Sunil Dutt (who went on to become a film star in Hindi Cinema), Ameen Sayani and elder brother Hamid Sayani, though not hired by Radio Ceylon became popular by using Radio Ceylon for broadcasting programs like &quot;Binaca Geetmala&quot; (first broadcast in 1952) and &quot;Lipton Ke Sitaare.&quot;
Its most popular features were film songs. While the golden age of Hindi-language film music was in the 1950s and 1960s, the station popularised movie songs, including the ones from Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, K.L. Saigal, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Mohammed Rafi, S. Janaki and others. The radio station took advantage of the situation as film music was banned by All India Radio and other Indian radio stations at the time. This led to increased listenership for radio programmes such as &quot;Binaca Geetmala&quot;. The &quot;Binaca Hit Parade&quot; was presented by Greg Roskowski, it was a countdown of English pop music beamed on the Commercial Service and the All Asia Service. Having heard the programme, the audience flooded the station with letters requesting a countdown of Hindi-language filmi songs and the idea of &quot;Binaca Geetmala&quot; was born.

Radio Ceylon also popularised English songs of Indian popular musicians - they went on to score huge hits, among them Uma Pocha (&quot;Bombay Meri Hai&quot;), Usha Uthup who has the rare distinction of singing Sri Lankan baila songs with ease and the Anglo-Indian star, Ernest Ignatius (who went on to be a success in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &#x27;Bombay Dreams&#x27; in London) had a massive hit, &quot;I married a female wrestler&quot;, on the Hindi service.

The station recorded jingles and beamed them on the All Asia Service - from Lux soap to Coca-Cola. Major brands queued up for their jingles to be broadcast live by the announcers of Radio Ceylon, such was the station&#x27;s advertising power.

== Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation ==
Radio Ceylon became a public corporation on 30 September 1967 and the station&#x27;s name was changed to the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation. Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake appointed a distinguished Ceylonese civil servant, Neville Jayaweera to head the CBC.

When Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972 the station underwent yet another name change as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC).

In December 2005 Sri Lanka celebrated its 80th anniversary . On 5 January 2007, the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated forty years as a public broadcasting corporation.

<text>Horatio Emmons Hale (May 3, 1817December 28, 1896) was an American-Canadian ethnologist, philologist and businessman. He is known for his study of languages as a key for classifying ancient peoples and being able to trace their migrations.

Hale was the first to analyze and confirm that the Tutelo language of some Virginia Native Americans belonged to the Siouan family, which was most associated with the western Dakota and Hidatsa languages.

Hale also determined that the Cherokee language spoken by a tribe associated with the Appalachian Mountains and upland areas of the interior American Southeast was one of the Iroquoian family of languages. Most of the speakers of the latter had historically occupied territory to the east and south of the Great Lakes, in present-day New York and Pennsylvania. In addition, he published a work, &quot;Iroquois Book of Rites&quot; (1883), based on his translation of their only two known historic manuscripts. It was supported by his studies with tribal elders in interpreting the Iroquois wampum belts to establish the people&#x27;s prehistory.

==Early life and education==
Horatio Hale was born on May 3, 1817, at Newport, New Hampshire, in the United States, the son of Sarah Josepha Hale (née Buell), a writer and prominent magazine editor, and David Hale, a lawyer who died when Hale was five. 
Entering Harvard College in 1833, Hale showed a marked faculty for languages. His first original work was published the next year, and attracted the attention of the college authorities. It consisted of an Algonkian vocabulary, which he gathered from a band of Native Americans who had camped on the college grounds. While at Harvard, he was a founding member of the A.D. Club, then known as an honorary chapter of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.

==United States Exploring Expedition==
Three years later, when the United States Exploring Expedition was organized under Charles Wilkes, Hale was recommended, while yet an undergraduate, for the post of ethnologist and philologist. He was appointed to the position.

From 1838 to 1842, Hale worked with the expedition, visiting South America, Australasia, Polynesia, and north-western America, then known as Oregon Country. From this point he returned overland. The Hale Passages of Puget Sound were named in recognition of his service to the expedition.

The expedition also traveled to Polynesia. Of the reports of that expedition, Hale prepared the sixth volume, &quot;Ethnography and Philology&quot; (1846), which is said to have laid the foundations of the ethnography of Polynesia.

== Personal life ==
Having completed his master&#x27;s degree at Harvard, Hale made a short tour of Europe. On his return, he studied law, and was admitted to the Chicago bar in 1855. In 1854, at Jersey City, New Jersey, he married Margaret Pugh, whom he met in Ontario. Her father William was formerly justice of the peace for the township of Goderich in Huron County, Canada West (now Ontario).

In 1856, the Hales moved to Clinton, Ontario, Canada, where he administered the estate of his father-in-law. He began to get involved in local real estate development and other business and educational endeavours.

He continued to reside in Clinton until his death, devoting much attention to the development of the Ontario school system. He was influential in introducing co-education of the sexes in high schools and collegiate institutes, in increasing the grants to these institutions, in establishing the normal school system for training of teachers, and in improving the methods of examination.

==Native American studies==
In Canada Hale returned to his study of First Nations and Native Americans. He was mentored by the Iroquois chiefs George Henry Martin Johnson and John Fraser, whom he met while visiting the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Ontario. In addition he traveled to the United States to consult with other native informants. Hale documented the oral history and rituals of the Iroquois Confederacy. He was assisted in interpreting the group&#x27;s wampum belts, which recounted their history. As a result of this work, he published &quot;The Iroquois Book of Rites&quot; (1883). He also studied the Iroquois languages, determining that Mohawk was the oldest. He also concluded that the Laurentian languages were Iroquoian.

Archeologists and linguists have since confirmed that the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were an early people who had occupied territory in what is now considered upper New England and along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and Ontario from about the 14th century to about 1580. They were likely destroyed by the Mohawk from central New York, who were competing for control of hunting grounds and the fur trade.

Hale made many valuable contributions to the science of ethnology, attracting attention particularly by his theory of the origin of the diversities of human languages and dialects. This was inspired by his study of child languages, or the languages invented by young children. He also emphasized the importance of languages as tests of mental capacity, and demonstrated that Native American languages were complex and had a high capacity for classification.

He used language as a criterion for the classification of human groups. He was the first to discover that the Tutelo language of Virginia belonged to the Siouan family, which was more commonly associated with the Dakota and Hidatsa languages and tribes located to the west of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.

He was also the first to identify the Cherokee language as a member of the Iroquoian family of languages. By the colonial and federal period, the Cherokee people were primarily located in the southern interior of present-day Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Most of their members were among the southeastern tribes forced to relocate during the Indian removal of the 1830s to territory west of the Mississippi River, in what was reserved for a time as Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma).

== Honours ==
Hale never received a doctorate but his research was recognized through his roles in a number of academic societies. 
In 1872, Hale was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.
In 1884, he reorganized the section of anthropology as an independent department of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting in Montreal that year. He had already performed a like service for the American Association. At the request of the British committee, he undertook the supervision of the anthropological section&#x27;s work in the Canadian North-west and British Columbia. The reports, which are very elaborate, were published in the Association&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot; from 1885 to 1897. While Hale continued as a member of the committee, he was asked to accept the position of vice-president at the Association&#x27;s meeting in Toronto (1896); he declined due to ill-health.
Hale was also a member of the American Folklore Society, serving as its president in 1893.
Hale was an honorary fellow of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, to which he contributed a number of papers.

== Death ==
Hale died on December 29, 1896, in Clinton, Ontario. In an appreciation of his life, Franz Boas wrote: &quot;Ethnology has lost a man who contributed more to the knowledge of human race than perhaps any student&quot;.

<doc id="1120645" wikidata="Q2703451" url="?curid=1120645" title="Beyond Freedom and Dignity">
<text>Beyond Freedom and Dignity is a 1971 book by American psychologist B. F. Skinner. Skinner argues that entrenched belief in free will and the moral autonomy of the individual (which Skinner referred to as &quot;dignity&quot;) hinders the prospect of using scientific methods to modify behavior for the purpose of building a happier and better-organized society.

&quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; may be summarized as an attempt to promote Skinner&#x27;s philosophy of science, the technology of human behavior, his conception of determinism, and what Skinner calls &quot;cultural engineering&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The book is organized into nine chapters.

===A Technology of Behavior===
In this chapter Skinner proposes that a technology of behavior is possible and that it can be used to help solve currently pressing human issues such as over-population and warfare. &quot;Almost all major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of human behavior.&quot;

===Freedom===
In this chapter Skinner offers a more precise definition of freedom, one that allows for his conception of determinism, and speaks to the conventional notion of freedom. Skinner argues against &quot;autonomous man&quot;.

Skinner notes that the forces of Freedom and Dignity have led to many positive advances in the human condition, but may now be hindering the advance of a technology of human behavior: &quot;[the literature of freedom and dignity] has been successful in reducing the aversive stimuli used in intentional control, but it has made the mistake of defining freedom in terms of states of mind or feelings...&quot;

===Dignity===
Dignity is the process by which people are given credit for their actions, or alternatively punished for them under the notion of responsibility. Skinner&#x27;s analysis rejects both as &quot;dignity&quot; – a false notion of inner causality which removes both credit for action and blame for misdeeds, &quot;the achievements for which a person himself is to be given credit seem to approach zero.&quot;.

Skinner notes that credit is typically a function of the conspicuousness of control. We give less or no credit, or blame, to those who are overtly coached, compelled, prompted or otherwise not appearing to be producing actions spontaneously.

===Punishment===
Skinner saw punishment as the logical consequence of an unscientific analysis of behavior as well as the tradition of &quot;freedom and dignity&quot;. Since individuals are seen to be making choices they are then able to be punished for those choices. Since Skinner denies the existence of free will, he therefore argued against punishment which he saw to be ineffective in controlling behavior.

===Alternatives to Punishment===
Skinner notes that the previous solutions to punishment are often not very useful and may create additional problems. Permissiveness, the metaphor of mid-wifery (or maieutics, ie the Socratic Method), &quot;guidance&quot;, a dependence on things, &quot;changing minds&quot;, all contain either problems or faulty assumptions about what is going on.

Skinner argues that this misunderstanding of control championed by the defenders of freedom and dignity &quot;encourage[s] the misuse of controlling practices and block progress towards a more effective technology of behavior.&quot;

===Values===
Skinner notes a &#x27;prescientific&#x27; view of man allows for personal achievement. The &#x27;scientific view&#x27; moves human action to be explained by species evolution and environmental history.

Skinner speaks to feelings about what is right, as well as popular notions of &quot;good&quot;. Skinner translates popular words and phrases around value issues into his view of contingencies of reinforcement. Skinner notes that even if the technology of behavior produces &quot;goods&quot; to improve human life, they expose environmental control, which is offensive to the &quot;freedom and dignity&quot; perspective.

===The Evolution of a Culture===
Skinner suggests that cultural evolution is a way to describe the aggregate of (operant) behavior. A culture is a collection of behavior, or practices. Skinner addresses &quot;social Darwinism&quot; and argues that as a justification of the subordination of other nations or of war competition with others is a small part of natural selection. A much more important part is competition with the physical environment itself. Skinner relates the idea of cultural evolution back to the question of values: whose values are to survive?

===The Design of a Culture===
Skinner notes that cultural design is not new, but is already existing and on-going. Skinner notes that most discussions of current problems are dominated by metaphors, concerns for feelings and states of mind which do not illuminate possible solutions. Skinner notes that behavior modification is ethically neutral.

Skinner notes that Utopian speculations, like his novel &quot;Walden Two&quot;, are a kind of cultural engineering. He then devotes much of the rest of this chapter to addressing the criticisms and complaints against cultural engineering.

===What is Man?===
Skinner again addresses the notion of the individual, and discusses how aspects of a person&#x27;s character could be assigned to environmental factors. He also covers cognition, problem solving, self-control and counters some arguments or possible misconceptions. Skinner notes that his analysis does not &quot;leave an empty organism&quot;. Skinner addresses the issue of mechanical models of human action, which are better addressed elsewhere. Skinner notes that, &quot;The evolution of a culture is a gigantic effort in self-control.&quot; and ends with, &quot;A scientific view of man offers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man.&quot;

==&quot;Walden Two&quot;==
&quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; is consistent with &quot;Walden Two&quot;, a 1948 novel by Skinner, depicting a utopian community based on his ideas regarding behavior modification. In &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; Skinner extends his argument for explicit cultural engineering of which &quot;Walden Two&quot; may be seen as an example.

==Reactions==
Linguist Noam Chomsky criticized Skinner&#x27;s methods and conclusions. His 1971 essay &quot;The Case Against B.F. Skinner&quot; responded to &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot;, arguing against behaviorism and its claim to scientific status. In response to Skinner&#x27;s denial of human dignity, Chomsky said, &quot;It would be absurd to conclude merely from the fact that freedom is limited, that “autonomous man” is an illusion (...) It would be hard to conceive of a more striking failure to comprehend even the rudiments of scientific thinking &quot;.

John Staddon criticized Skinner&#x27;s contention that punishment is ineffective and free-will an unnecessary concept, arguing that &quot;Punishment doesn&#x27;t always abolish freedom -- and freedom is not just absence of punishment&quot;.

<text>The Tareen (or Tarin) () is a Pashtun tribe inhabiting southern Afghanistan, and western region of Pakistan.

==History==
Much of the tribe continues to live in their native lands in the southern parts of Afghanistan and Pishin in Baluchistan, Pakistan. During the reign of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628 to 1658) a group of Tareen/Tarin emigrated to the area which is now the Hazara region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The Tareen Chiefs resisted the Sikh occupation of Hazara region which resulted in their properties/ land being usurped by Sikh armies.

==Branches (Clans)==
According to Ni&#x27;mat Allah al-Harawi in &quot;History of the Afghans&quot;, Tareen had three sons namely: Tor, Spin (Aspin or Speen) and Awdal/Born Tareen/Abdali. Their descendants today have adopted the names above as tribal identities and are known as Tor Tareen, Spin Tareen and Bor Tareen. These three major clans are further divided into smaller units.

== Location ==
Tareens primarily live in Pishin,

<text>There are several songs about Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute traditionally sung at special events.

==Here&#x27;s to Old RPI==
&quot;Here&#x27;s to Old RPI&quot; is the Alma Mater of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It is sung at various formal events. It is also played by the RPI Pep Band at Hockey games (when it is traditional to stand and sing along while the band is playing). It was written in 1897 by Edmund Fales, and was published in the first book of &quot; Songs of Rensselaer&quot;, printed in 1913.

===Lyrics===
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to old RPI, her fame may never die.&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to old Rensselaer, she stands today without a peer.&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to those olden days,&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to those golden days,&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to the friends we made at dear old RPI.&quot;

==All We&#x27;ve Learned at Rensselaer==
&quot;All We&#x27;ve Learned at Rensselaer&quot; is a song written by Rensselyrics co-founder Tom Willner and traditionally sung by the Rensselyrics at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute commencement ceremonies. Each verse or section has a different musical style, several of which are closely based on Billy Joel songs or other popular music.

As many facets of life at RPI have changed over the years, the lyrics have changed appropriately. For example, &quot;F-Test&quot; (once the bane of all freshmen who had regularly scheduled 8am exam periods) has been replaced with &quot;Chem Test&quot;. Likewise, the &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; (a former eatery in RPI&#x27;s Student Union) has been replaced by a new addition in the same building (the fishtank) and an existing feature (the pub).

However, some of the classes still referred to in the song no longer exist:
* COLD (Computer Organization and Logic Design), succeeded in the 1997-1998 catalog by &quot;Computer Components &amp; Operations&quot; (CoCO)
* Lumps (Lumped Parameter Systems), very similar to what is now Dynamic Systems

Additionally, the stanza listing several buildings by their acronyms is somewhat outdated, as the school administration made a concerted effort to eliminate the acronym form of building names in the late 1990s (though many students and faculty continue to refer to the acronyms):
* JEC - J. Erik Jonsson Engineering Center
* JROWL - Jonsson-Rowland Science Center
* CII - George M. Low Center for Industrial Innovation
* DCC - Darrin Communications Center
* VCC - Voorhes Computing Center
* C+CC - Chapel and Cultural Center
* CDC - Career Development Center

Other acronyms:
* AML (Advanced Machining Lab)
* CAD (Computer-Aided Drawing)
* CAM (Computer-Aided Machining)
* CANOS (Computer Architecture, Networks and Operating Systems)
* CHUD (Computer Hardware Design)
* Diff EQ (Differential Equations)
* DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)
* DMS (Design of Mechanical Systems)
* E-I (Electronic Instrumentation)
* EMAC (Electronic Media, Arts, and Communication)
* EMD (Elements of Machine Design)
* EPAL (Electric Power Analysis Lab)
* GMP (General Manufacturing Processes)
* IEA (Introduction to Engineering Analysis)
* IED (Introduction to Engineering Design)
* IPAC (Information and Personal Assistance Center)
* MAU (Modeling and Analysis of Uncertainty)
* MSL (Mechanical Systems Lab)
* O-Chem (Organic Chemistry)
* PDI (Programs in Design and Innovation)
* POMCA (Production Operations Management &amp; Cost Accounting)
* S-O (Student Orientation)
* STS (Science and Technology Studies)
* TF1/2 (Thermal Fluids 1/2)
* UPAC (Union Programs and Activities Committee)

In more recent years, this entertaining song has been cut from the ceremony by administration at the last minute for unknown reasons. It was absent from the program for the 201st Commencement of the spring of 2007, though was present in earlier years.

===Lyrics===
:&quot;All we&#x27;ve learned at Rensselaer from all we&#x27;ve had to do,&quot;
:&quot;It started in our freshman year when we did not have a clue.&quot;
:&quot;We knew about the hockey team, we heard about SO,&quot;
:&quot;and without a doubt we soon found out about the ratio.&quot;
:&quot;Well we played in Fresh Olympics and we ate the Commons food,&quot;
:&quot;yes we slept through every Chem Test despite the caffeine we consumed.&quot;
:&quot;We&#x27;d come home every evening back to painted concrete walls,&quot;
:&quot;where we&#x27;d throw things at our roommates in those ancient freshman halls.&quot;
:&quot;Some may search for refuge, find solace as a Greek,&quot;
:&quot;we pledged ourselves, we rushed and hoped that we&#x27;d make it through hell week.&quot;
:&quot;Then by lucky chance, or by begging for a grade or two,&quot;
:&quot;we passed our freshman year, but we were hardly through.&quot;
:&quot;There was:&quot;
:&quot;I Mech, EMAC, Diff Eq and Chem Mat,&quot;
:&quot;BTM, STS, IEA, and MPS.&quot;
:&quot;Lumps, COLD, O Chem, Dirt, Anal, P Chem,&quot;
:&quot;Complex, CANOS, they don&#x27;t even pay us.&quot;
:&quot;Quantum Psych-n-CHuD, Human Fac, Soc-n-CruD,&quot;
:&quot;Bio, IED, Aeroelasticity.&quot;
:&quot;Macro, Micro, Fluids and Thermo,&quot;
:&quot;working in the lab all day, what else do we have to say.&quot;
:&quot;Partial Credit, GPA, it&#x27;s you, it&#x27;s you, oh gods we serve,&quot;
:&quot;we pray for salvation, so that we may ride the curve.&quot;
:&quot;Mother&#x27;s, Father&#x27;s, the Bookstore, the Games Room,&quot;
:&quot;the fishtank the pub and the Rat,&quot;
:&quot;E-board, J-board, IPAC, UPAC,&quot;
:&quot;We all pack&#x27;s-a-matter of fact. (EMPAC!)&quot;
:&quot;The Bursar, the Registrar, to West Hell or to Greene,&quot;
:&quot;JEC, CII, DCC, VCC, CDC, C+CC.&quot;
:&quot;but of all we&#x27;ve learned at Rensselaer from all we&#x27;ve had to do,&quot;
:&quot;There&#x27;s one thing that all sums it up, and it&#x27;s in the following tune.&quot;
:&quot;e to the x, dy/dx, e to the x dx&quot;
:&quot;cosine, secant, tangent, sine,&quot;
:&quot;three point one four one five nine&quot;
:&quot;square root, cube root, log of pi,&quot;
:&quot;dis-integrate them: RPI.&quot;

==Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer==
&quot;Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer&quot; is the school&#x27;s fight song. It is still played today by the RPI Pep Band at athletic events and other school functions. At some point someone updated the words of the fight song to make it more politically correct than it was back in the 60&#x27;s. Where it now says &quot;We all must do our part&quot; used to be &quot;Each man must do his part&quot; and the line &quot;True to old Rensselaer.&quot; used to be &quot;True sons of Rensselaer.&quot; 

===Lyrics===
Words and Music by Charles S. Root &#x27;34

:&quot;Hail, dear old Rensselaer, the college of our heart.&quot;
:&quot;For dear old Rensselaer, we all must do our part.&quot;
:&quot;True to old Rensselaer, we&#x27;ll always strive to be.&quot;
:&quot;Now, dear old Rensselaer, hail to thee.&quot;

:&quot;Hear the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet.&quot;
:&quot;Hear the rat-tat-tat of drums that beat.&quot;
:&quot;Hear the voices ringing loud and sweet.&quot;
:&quot;Hear that mighty shout of ...&quot;

:&quot;Hail, dear old Rensselaer, the college of our heart.&quot;
:&quot;For dear old Rensselaer, we all must do our part.&quot;
:&quot;True to old Rensselaer, we&#x27;ll always strive to be.&quot;
:&quot;Now, dear old Rensselaer, hail to thee.&quot;

==Can You Spell Rensselaer?==
Throughout the school&#x27;s history, incoming students and non-students experience difficulty with the spelling and pronunciation of &quot;Rensselaer&quot;. While the local population of those native to Troy, New York colloquially use two syllables when saying the name (e.g., &quot;ren&#x27;-slur&quot;), the student population always uses three (e.g., &quot;ren&#x27;-suh-leer&quot;). This song, with words and music by E.M. Frost, 1911, aims to simplify the art of spelling the name.
===Lyrics===
:&quot;Can you spell Rensselaer? R-E-N-S-S&quot;
:&quot;If not, you&#x27;re no Engineer. E-L-A-E-R&quot;
:&quot;Come on, boys, now boys, come gather &#x27;round,&quot;
:&quot;And we&#x27;ll sing a Rensselaer song on the town.&quot;
:&quot;Then we&#x27;ll give a yell,&quot;
:&quot;In which we&#x27;ll tell,&quot;
:&quot;to everyone who&#x27;s near –&quot;
:&quot;That R-E-N-S-S-E-L-A-E-R spells &#x27;Rensselaer&#x27;.&quot;

<text>MaxDB is an ANSI SQL-92 (entry level) compliant relational database management system (RDBMS) from SAP AG, which was also delivered by MySQL AB from 2003 to 2007. MaxDB is targeted for large SAP environments e.g. mySAP Business Suite, and other applications that require enterprise-level database functionality.

== History ==
The database development started in 1977 as a research project at Technische Universität Berlin headed by Rudolf Munz. In the early 1980s it became a database product that was subsequently owned by Nixdorf Computer, Siemens-Nixdorf, Software AG and today by SAP AG. It has at various times been named VDN, RDS, Reflex, Supra 2, DDB/4, Entire SQL-DB-Server and Adabas D. In 1997 SAP acquired the software from Software AG and developed it as SAP DB, releasing the source code under the GNU General Public License in October 2000.

In 2003 SAP AG and MySQL AB jointly re-branded the database system as MaxDB. In October 2007 this reselling agreement was terminated and sales and support of the database were reverted to SAP. SAP AG now manages MaxDB development, distribution, and support. New versions of the source code of MaxDB are no longer available under the GNU General Public License. SAP also stated that &quot;Further commercial support concepts to cover mission critical use requirements outside of SAP scenarios are currently subject to discussion.&quot;

MaxDB since version 7.5 is based on the code base of SAP DB 7.4. Therefore, the MaxDB software version 7.5 can be used as a direct upgrade of previous SAP DB versions starting at 7.2.04 and higher.

SAP has announced that there will be no minor or major updates after version 7.9. SAP is sunsetting the product, favoring the HANA database instead .
== Features ==
MaxDB is delivered with a set of administration and development tools. Most tools are available with both a GUI and command line interface (CLI). It offers bindings for JDBC; ODBC; SQLDBC (native C/C++ interface); precompiler; PHP; Perl; Python; WebDAV; OLE DB, ADO, DAO, RDO and .NET via ODBC; Delphi and Tcl via Third Party Programming Interfaces. MaxDB is cross-platform, offering releases for HP-UX, IBM AIX, Linux, Solaris, Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and up to Microsoft Windows 10.

MaxDB offers built-in hot backup, does not need any online reorganizations and claims to be SQL 92 Entry-Level compatible.

MaxDB since version 7.7.00, uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) instead of the previous lock based implementation.

== Licensing ==
MaxDB was licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) from versions 7.2 through 7.6. Programming interfaces were licensed under the GPL with exceptions for projects released under other open source licenses.

SAP DB 7.3 and 7.4 were licensed as GPL but with LGPL drivers. MaxDB 7.5 was offered under dual licensing, i.e. licensed as GPL with GPL drivers or a commercial license.

From version 7.5 through version 7.6 onwards distribution of MaxDB (previously SAP DB) to the open source community was provided by MySQL AB, the same company that develops the open-source software database, MySQL.
Development was done by SAP AG, MySQL AB and the open-source software community.

In October 2007 SAP assumed full sales and commercial support for MaxDB. MaxDB 7.6 is now closed source, available free-of-charge (without support, and with usage restrictions) for use with non-SAP applications.

<doc id="1120678" wikidata="Q18709" url="?curid=1120678" title="Patos (municipality)">
<text>Patos () is a town and a municipality in the County of Fier, Albania. The municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Patos, Ruzhdie and Zharrëz, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the town Patos. The municipality&#x27;s population is 18,227 as of the 2011 census, in a total area of 82.59 km2. It is the center of the oil industry in Albania, and is 7 kilometers southeast from the city of Fier.

==History==
The etymology of Patos is likely borrowed from Ancient Greek πάθος (Pathos).

Patos is a very old city. It was a city for oil in the modern day and during King of Albania era and during the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania era. The city was also for the works to sleep in and investors. The city is one of the biggest offshore oil field in the Balkans and in Europe. The Patos-Marinza Oil Field was discovered in 1928. It produces about 11,854 barrels everyday, more than other oil fields. It has a reserve of 2 billion barrels. This developed Patos into an oil hub for Europe and the world.

==Economy==
The economy of Patos is mainly based on oil companies such as Bankers Petroleum, and Albpetrol. Patos is on the Patos-Marinza Oil Field which one of the biggest offshore oil fields. There has been an estimate of 1.500 million barrels underground and there is a proven reserve of 2 billion barrels of oil.

<doc id="1120679" wikidata="Q3499839" url="?curid=1120679" title="Toledo Storm">
<text>The Toledo Storm were a minor league professional ice hockey team in the ECHL from 1991 to 2007. The Storm played their home games at the venerable Toledo Sports Arena along the eastern banks of the Maumee River in Toledo, Ohio. The team colors were red and white, similar to the Detroit Red Wings, their NHL affiliate for fourteen of their sixteen seasons. The Storm would win six division titles, two Henry Brabham Cups and two Jack Riley Cups as champion of the East Coast Hockey League. The franchise suspended operations following the 2006–07 season after they were sold to Toledo Arena Sports, Inc. The Storm returned to the ECHL for the 2009–10 season as the Toledo Walleye.

The Storm&#x27;s logo was notorious for poor appearance, and was voted &quot;Worst Logo&quot; in &quot;The Hockey News&quot; annual survey of minor league hockey logos several times.

== History ==
=== McSorley era (1991–94) ===
The Toledo Storm were founded in 1991, joining the East Coast Hockey League for the 1991–92 season as an expansion franchise with two other Ohio franchises, the Columbus Chill and Dayton Bombers, and the Raleigh IceCaps of Raleigh, North Carolina. The Storm&#x27;s first head coach was Chris McSorley, older brother of NHLer Marty McSorley, Chris McSorley had previously played for the Toledo Goaldiggers of the International Hockey League from 1984–86. One of McSorley&#x27;s first actions as head coach would be to procure an affiliation agreement with the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings, a team that was heavily supported by Toledo hockey fans as Detroit was within an hour drive of Toledo. In the first year under McSorley, the Storm would play to an impressive record of 46–15–3, winning the West Division title and the Brabham Cup as the team with the best overall record during the ECHL&#x27;s regular season. Despite the regular season success, the Storm would fall in the first round of the ECHL playoffs, being upset by the Louisville Icehawks four games to one.

The following season, McSorley would once again ice a very competitive team, posting a regular season record of 36–17–11 and a second consecutive West Division title for the Storm and defenceman Derek Booth would become the first member of the team to win an ECHL award, as he was named the Defenseman of the Year for the 1992–93 season. The Storm&#x27;s finish in the top three of the West Division granted them a bye to the West Division semifinals of the 1993 Riley Cup playoffs. The Storm would be matched with the West Division&#x27;s fourth place team, the Erie Panthers, who had defeated the Greensboro Monarchs in the second round of the playoffs. The Storm took the first two games of the series at the Toledo Sports Arena 6–3 and 5–2, before Erie won Game Three 9–6 at Louis J. Tullio Arena in the highest scoring game of the 1992–93 Riley Cup playoffs. The Storm would close out the series in Game Four, defeating Erie 6–2 to move to the West Division Finals against the West Division&#x27;s third place team the Nashville Knights who had swept the West Division&#x27;s second seed the Dayton Bombers.

Toledo would once again take the first two games of the series defeating Nashville 3–1 in Game One and 7–4 in Game Two. When the series moved back to Nashville, the Knights would take Game Three with a 4–3 overtime victory and tie the series with a 3–2 victory in Game Four. Toledo would take Game Five in Toledo 8–2 and finish the series off with a 9–5 victory in Game Six in Nashville, to earn the first trip to the Riley Cup Finals in club history where they would play the Brabham Cup titleholder Wheeling Thunderbirds. Wheeling would take the first two games of the series 5–3 and 7–3, but the Storm would tie the series when it moved to Toledo, winning Game Three 4–3 and Game Four 7–5. Toledo would take control of the series with a 4–2 victory in Wheeling in Game Five and would clinch their first Riley Cup championship with a 7–6 overtime win in Game Six. Forward Rick Judson was named the Riley Cup Playoffs Most Valuable Player in Toledo&#x27;s first league championship since the Toledo Goaldiggers won the IHL&#x27;s Turner Cup during the 1982–83 season.

=== Later years ===

The Storm celebrated their 15th-anniversary during the 2005–06 season, adopting a new logo marking the occasion. The Storm&#x27;s last season of operation was 2006–2007. The final game was played April 19, 2007, at U.S. Bank Arena against the Cincinnati Cyclones in the North Division Semifinals. The Cyclones won 3–0, sweeping the series in three games.

=== Women&#x27;s hockey firsts ===
The Toledo Storm once featured a female goaltender, Erin Whitten, who on March 7, 1996 became the first woman ever to appear in a professional hockey game in a position other than goaltender; she played at forward for 18 seconds in a game against the Madison Monsters. She was the first U.S.-born woman to play professional hockey when she appeared for the East Coast Hockey League&#x27;s Toledo Storm, and on October 30, 1993, became the first woman goaltender to record a professional victory.

<text>Langley Green is a one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley in West Sussex, England. Langley Green is in the north-west of the town and is bordered by Manor Royal to the east, Northgate to the south east, West Green to the south across the ring road and Ifield to the west. The main streets running through the community are Stagelands, Martyrs Avenue and Langley Drive. Many of the streets are named after trees and plants (Honeysuckle Lane, Hawthorn Close) animals (Hare Lane, Fox Close) or birds (Jackdaw Close, Swallow Road, Raven Lane). A small shopping parade, St Leonards Church, The Dr. Johnson Pub and Langley Green Primary School formed the centre of the community.

==History==
===20th century===
Work started on Langley Green in the early 1950s with workers being brought down from London by train and living in huts on site. After nine months workers were entitled to a council house, and many of the early population of Langley Green were builders by profession. As Langley Green was within walking distance of the new factory estate, many of the factory workers brought down from London with firms such as APV settled here. Houses in Langley Green ranged from two to four bedrooms, with a small number of flats and bungalows. Heating was by coal, with the coal being stored under the staircase. In some houses water was also heated by solid fuel burners. Many of Langley Green&#x27;s residents became private house holders in the 1980s when the Margaret Thatcher government had a policy of selling council houses to tenants. Over the years virtually every house on the estate had been improved. The addition of central heating has been almost universal. Other common improvements include double glazing, insulation of walls and roofs and removal of walls and doors to create bigger rooms.

===Today===
Today the small neighbourhood is one of the most multi cultural in Crawley and has a lively and friendly community. There were few ethnic-minority families living in Langley Green before the late 1960s. The first families tended to buy their own property and as these were limited at the time, the new immigrants concentrated in areas around Denchers Plat and Beckett Lane. Langley Green is now home to the Crawley Islamic Centre and Mosque.

Two of the neighbourhood&#x27;s most notable residents were Roy Whiting and boxer Alan Minter. In 1972 he won an Olympic bronze medal and went on to become world middleweight champion. Whiting, who was born locally in 1959, was convicted of one of the most high-profile murder cases in Britain in modern times in December 2001; the murder of Sarah Payne, who went missing in Littlehampton on the West Sussex coast on 1 July 2000 and whose body was found near Pulborough 16 days later.

Gatwick Airport is also within the Langley Green Area and provides another important source of employment.

<text>Xuanwu District () was a district of the Municipality of Beijing, China. It was located southwest to the city center, outside of Xuanwu Gate. The district was merged into Xicheng District in July 2010.

Located outside the Imperial Inner City and predominantly reserved for the lower class, the district was over 16.5 km2 in size. Although historically considered a wealthy area of Beijing as one of the older districts of the former Imperial City, Xuanwu District underwent rapid changes in its recent history leading up its merger into Xicheng District. The area was also the birthplace of Peking Opera and housed the Caishikou Execution Grounds during the Qing Dynasty.

Xuanwu District had a large Muslim population.

Popular destinations in Xuanwu District include:
*Niujie Mosque
*Fayuan Temple
*Liulichang—an antiques market
*Huguang Guild Hall

==Economy==
Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, the authors of &quot;Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing,&quot; stated in 2002 that Beijing&#x27;s economic development was northward oriented and the economic development in the Xuanwu District &quot;lags behind&quot; Dongcheng District and Xicheng District, adjacent districts located towards the north.

==Education==
Prior to the district&#x27;s dissolution, The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University was located in Xuanwu.

One school in Niujie, the Beijing Xuanwu Huimin Elementary School (), serves the Hui people living in Beijing. That was previously in the Xuanwu District.

Xuanwu Normal Experimental Affiliated Number One Primary School (北京市宣武师范学校附属第一小学) is located in the former Xuanwu District.

<doc id="1120690" wikidata="Q1530925" url="?curid=1120690" title="Scorpius (novel)">
<text>Scorpius, first published in 1988, is the seventh novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (the first original Bond novel not to be published by Jonathan Cape) and in the United States by Putnam.

==Plot summary==
After being connected to the death of a woman in London, Bond is called in by M to aid the investigation. Returning from Hereford, Special Air Service Sergeant Pearlman tags along by driving Bond back, during which they are attacked and involved in a high-speed chase on an English motorway. Upon safely returning to headquarters, Bond is briefed on the investigation by M and Chief Superintendent Bailey. The woman, whom Bond does not know, was found dead with Bond&#x27;s telephone number. She is a member of a cult society known as &quot;The Meek Ones&quot;, operated by a Father Valentine. With additional information from the CIA, the British Secret Service learn that Valentine is an alias for Vladimir Scorpius, an arms dealer for several terrorist organisations.

As the country&#x27;s general election approaches, by the use of brainwashed cult members, Scorpius has begun a &quot;holy war&quot; against every man, woman, and child. The cult members, thinking themselves to be pure, moral, and unsullied, sacrifice their lives for &quot;the greater good of humanity&quot;, believing that by performing this &quot;death task&quot; they will achieve paradise. Throughout the novel, The Meek Ones commit several acts of terrorism, including bombings and assassinations of British politicians.

Throughout the horror, Bond meets Harriett Horner, an IRS agent working undercover in England and investigating a credit card company run by Scorpius. The two work together along with Pearlman to attempt to track down Scorpius. After an interrogation of a captured cult member, Horner is taken captive by Scorpius&#x27; men. Additionally, Pearlman confesses to Bond that he was secretly giving Scorpius information for the benefit of his daughter who had been brainwashed. Together the two set out for Scorpius&#x27; base of operations in South Carolina, having Scorpius believe Pearlman was taking Bond captive.

At Scorpius&#x27; island, Bond meets up with Horner once again and the two actually marry at the behest of Scorpius. Knowing that the marriage is invalid, Bond agrees to go ahead with it thinking it would buy him time until he can escape. On the night the two decide to escape, Harriett is killed by a water moccasin. At the same time the FBI is conducting a raid of Scorpius&#x27; island, which further angers Bond since her death was in vain. Bond returns to the island, finding Scorpius attempting to flee. After giving chase, Bond successfully gets the upper hand and forces Scorpius to die in a similar manner to that of Horner.

==Characters in &quot;Scorpius&quot;==
* James Bond
* M
* Bill Tanner
* Miss Moneypenny
* Harriett Horner: An IRS agent secretly working in England undercover, she is found by Bond and later captured by Scorpius. At Scorpius&#x27; base, Bond and Horner pretend to marry, only for her to die a couple days later when attempting to flee Scorpius&#x27; island.
* Sergeant Pearlman: Pearlman first meets Bond to deliver a message that he is requested by M. Pearlman drives Bond back and in doing so earns Bond&#x27;s trust. Bond later learns, however, that Pearlman was secretly feeding Scorpius information because his daughter was brainwashed and a member of The Meek Ones. He confesses this much to Bond and requests help in getting his daughter free from the society. Unfortunately for Pearlman, when the opportunity arises, his daughter is sent on a &quot;death task&quot; to kill both the President of the United States and the British prime minister. She is unsuccessful and subsequently killed by Bond before she can detonate her explosives.
* Chief Superintendent Bailey: Bailey is sent by Special Branch to aid in the investigation of the terrorist activities in England. From the beginning he is aiding Scorpius by giving him information that allow Scorpius to be always one step ahead of everyone. Bailey is shot and killed by Bond at the White House after attempting to witness the assassinations of both the President of the United States and the British prime minister.
* Vladimir Scorpius: Scorpius, also known as Father Valentine, is an arms dealer and the creator of the cult society, &quot;The Meek Ones.&quot; By numerous sources he is considered to be Satan incarnate. After the death of Bond&#x27;s &quot;unofficial&quot; wife, Bond returns to Scorpius&#x27; island and kills him in the same manner in which she died, although after forcing him outside and wounding him several times.

==Reception==

<doc id="1120692" wikidata="Q711589" url="?curid=1120692" title="Henry Savile (Bible translator)">
<text>Sir Henry Savile (30 November 154919 February 1622) was an English scholar and mathematician, Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton. He endowed the Savilian chairs of Astronomy and of Geometry at Oxford University, and was one of the scholars who translated the New Testament from Greek into English. He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Bossiney in Cornwall in 1589, and Dunwich in Suffolk in 1593.

==Life==
He was the son of Henry Savile of Over Bradley, Stainland, near Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, a member of an old county family, the Saviles of Methley, and of his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Ramsden.

Savile matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1561. He then became a Fellow of Merton College in 1565. He established a reputation as a Greek scholar and mathematician by voluntary lectures on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, and in 1575 became Junior Proctor of the university. In 1578 he travelled on the continent of Europe, where he collected manuscripts, and is said to have been employed by Queen Elizabeth as her resident in the Low Countries. On his return he was named Greek tutor to the Queen.

In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Savile, with John Chamber and Thomas Digges, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by John Dee. In 1585 he was established as Warden of Merton by a vigorous exercise of the interest of Burghley and Secretary Walsingham. He proved a successful and autocratic head of house, generally unpopular with Fellows and undergraduates, but under him the college flourished. His translation of four books of the &quot;Histories of Tacitus&quot;, with the learned &quot;Commentary on Roman Warfare&quot; (1591), enhanced his reputation. He also sat in Parliament as one of the two members for Bossiney in 1589 and for Dunwich (both were notorious rotten boroughs) in 1593.

On 26 May 1596 he obtained the provostship of Eton College, the reward of persistent begging. He was not qualified for the post under the statutes of the college, for he was not in holy orders, and the Queen was reluctant to name him. Savile insisted with considerable ingenuity that the Queen had a right to dispense with statutes, and at last he got his way. In February 1601 he was put under arrest on suspicion of having been concerned in the rebellion of the Earl of Essex.

He was soon released, and his friendship with the faction of Essex went far to gain him the favour of James I. So no doubt did the views he had maintained in regard to the statutes of Eton. It may have been to his advantage that his elder brother, Sir John Savile (1545–1607), was a high prerogative lawyer and one of the barons of the exchequer, who in 1606 affirmed the right of the King to impose import and export duties on his own authority.

On 30 September 1604 Savile was knighted, and in that year he was named one of the body of scholars appointed to prepare the Authorised Version of the Bible. He was entrusted with parts of the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation.

In 1619 he founded and endowed a chair in astronomy and a chair in geometry at Oxford, both bearing his name. He died at Eton on 19 February 1622, and is buried there. A fine mural monument to him in Merton College Chapel offers views of contemporary Merton and Eton and references to his literary achievements (notably Chrysostom).

Sir Henry Savile has sometimes been confounded with another Henry Savile, called Long Harry (1570–1617), who gave currency to the forged addition to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Asser which contains the story that King Alfred founded the University of Oxford.

==Works==
In 1596 Savile produced the first printed edition of the first four books of the &quot;Gesta Pontificum Anglorum&quot; – an ecclesiastical history of England written by William of Malmesbury in the early 12th century. Savile used Cambridge University Library MS Ff.1.25.1 as his source for this, which was a copy of a copy of the original manuscript.

His edition of the works of St. John Chrysostom in eight folio volumes was published in 1610–1613. It was printed by the king&#x27;s printer on a private press erected at the expense of Sir Henry, who imported the type. The &quot;Chrysostom&quot; cost him £8,000 and did not sell well. However, it was the most considerable work of pure learning undertaken in England in his time, as it involved consulting French Chrysostomians and the despatching of young researchers to the Imperial Library in Vienna and the Patriarchal Library at Heybeliada or Halki, (then under the Ottoman Empire) and other leading monasteries and/or collections in his time. At the same press he published an edition of the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; in 1618.

Savile was keen to impart his understanding of mathematics to his students at Oxford, and in founding the Geometry chair he gave thirteen preparatory lectures on the original books of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; in 1620. These were published in 1621 as his &quot;Praelectiones tresdecim in principium elementorum Euclidis, Oxonii habitae MCDXX&quot;. Oxonii: Excudebant Iohannes Lichfield, &amp; Iacobus Short, 1621. (&#x27;Thirteen introductory lectures on the beginning of the Elements of Euclid, held at Oxford in 1620&#x27;.) It was Savile who first traced the hand of Theon of Alexandria as a commentator on Euclid.

The edition published in England, until then the only one containing all the extant works attributed to Euclid, was that of Dr David Gregory, published at Oxford in 1703, with the title, &quot;Εὐκλείδου τὰ σωζόμενα, Euclidis quae supersunt omnia&quot;. The parallel Greek text is that of the 1533 Basel edition by Simon Grynäus, corrected from Savile&#x27;s 13th century Greek MSS. which Savile bequeathed to the Savilian Library, and from Savile&#x27;s annotations in his own copy. The Latin translation, which accompanies the Greek on the same page, is for the most part that of Commandino.

==Collections==

In 1619, after founding two lectureships in geometry and astronomy, Savile donated a library to the university. It was a collection of mathematical works, including the related subjects of optics, harmonics, mechanics, cosmography, the applied sciences of surveying, navigation, and fortification, and a quantity of fine printed books, primarily from the 16th century.

Nearly all of the seventeenth-century Savilian professors added to the library. Dr. Peter Turner (Geometry Chair, 1631–48) bequeathed Greek manuscripts, John Greaves (Astronomy Chair, 1643-9) added some of his own papers. Part of the Savilian library might also have come from Dr. Seth Ward (Astronomy Chair, 1649–61) sometime after 1682. It was Sir Christopher Wren (Astronomy, 1661-1673), however, who gave the first extensive contribution to the library, leaving his astronomy and geometry books to it when he retired from the Chair. A catalogue of the Savile library appeared in Dr. Edward Bernard&#x27;s (Astronomy chair, 1673–91) &quot;Catalogi Librorum Manuscriptorum Angliae and Hiberniae&quot;. Dr. John Wallis (Savilian professor, 1649-1704) gave the Savilian library &#x27;the largest of its accretions&#x27;, and many more were provided after his death in 1703. In the eighteenth century, not much more was added to Savile&#x27;s collection, but later Stephen Rigaud (Geometry Chair, 1810–27; Astronomy, 1827–39) catalogued and contributed to it further. Rigaud died in 1839, and in 1874 his sons presented his scientific notebooks to the Savile library.

In 1835 Savile&#x27;s library was moved to the south-east corner of the Bodleian quadrangle, where it remained until 1884, when the Savilian professors agreed to hand over its administration to the Bodleian Library.

==Family==
In 1592 he married Margaret, daughter of George Dacre, of Chesham. In 1604 their only son died, and Savile is thought to have been induced by this loss to devote the bulk of his fortune to the promotion of learning. His surviving child Elizabeth married Sir John Sedley and was mother of Sir Charles Sedley.

His brother, Thomas Savile (died 1593), was also a member of Merton College and had some reputation as a scholar.

<doc id="1120701" wikidata="Q422435" url="?curid=1120701" title="Bromazepam">
<text>Bromazepam, sold under many brand names, is a benzodiazepine. It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam. In addition to being used to treat anxiety or panic states, bromazepam may be used as a premedicant prior to minor surgery. Bromazepam typically comes in doses of 3 mg and 6 mg tablets.
It was patented in 1961 by Roche and approved for medical use in 1974.

==Medical uses==

Medical uses include treatment of severe anxiety. Despite certain side effects and the emergence of alternative products (e.g. pregabalin), benzodiazepine medication remains an effective way of reducing problematic symptoms, and is typically deemed effective by patients and medical professionals.
Similarly to other intermediate-acting depressants, it may be used as hypnotic medication or in order to mitigate withdrawal effects of alcohol consumption.

==Pharmacology==

Bromazepam is a &quot;classical&quot; benzodiazepine; other classical benzodiazepines include: diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, and clorazepate. Its molecular structure is composed of a diazepine connected to a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, the benzene ring having a single nitrogen atom that replaces one of the carbon atoms in the ring structure. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepine, which means that the nitrogens on the seven-sided diazepine ring are in the 1 and 4 positions.

Bromazepam binds to the GABA receptor GABAA, causing a conformational change and increasing the inhibitory effects of GABA. It acts as a positive modulator, increasing the receptors&#x27; response when activated by GABA itself or an agonist (such as alcohol). As opposed to barbital, BZDs are not GABA-receptor activators and rely on increasing the neurotransmitter&#x27;s natural activity. Bromazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, is moderately lipophilic compared to other substances of its class and metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. It does not possess any antidepressant or antipsychotic qualities.

After night time administration of bromazepam a highly significant reduction of gastric acid secretion occurs during sleep followed by a highly significant rebound in gastric acid production the following day.

Bromazepam alters the electrical status of the brain causing an increase in beta activity and a decrease in alpha activity in EEG recordings.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Bromazepam is reported to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since itraconazole, a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at the Solvay Pharmaceutical Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism.

The major metabolite of bromazepam is hydroxybromazepam, which is an active agent too and has a half-life approximately equal to that of bromazepam.

==Side-effects==

Bromazepam is similar in side effects to other benzodiazepines. The most common side effects reported are drowsiness, sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and dizziness. Impairments to memory functions are common with bromazepam and include a reduced working memory and reduced ability to process environmental information. A 1975 experiment on healthy, male college students exploring the effects of four different drugs on learning capacity observed that taking bromazepam alone at 6 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks impaired learning capacities significantly. In combination with alcohol, impairments in learning capacity became even more pronounced. Various studies report impaired memory, visual information processing and sensory data and impaired psychomotor performance; deterioration of cognition including attention capacity and impaired co-ordinative skills; impaired reactive and attention performance, which can impair driving skills; drowsiness and decrease in libido. Unsteadiness after taking bromazepam is, however, less pronounced than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam.

On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme alterations in memory such as anterograde amnesia and amnesic automatism, which may have medico-legal consequences. Such reactions occur usually only at the higher dose end of the prescribing spectrum.

Very rarely, dystonia can develop.

Up to 30% treated on a long-term basis develop a form of dependence, i.e. these patients cannot stop the medication without experiencing physical and/or psychological benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.

Leukopenia and liver-damage of the cholestatic type with or without jaundice (icterus) have additionally been seen; the original manufacturer Roche recommends regular laboratory examinations to be performed routinely.

Ambulatory patients should be warned that bromazepam may impair the ability to drive vehicles and to operate machinery. The impairment is worsened by consumption of alcohol, because both act as central nervous system depressants. During the course of therapy, tolerance to the sedative effect usually develops.

===Frequency and seriousness of adverse effects===

As with all medication, the frequency and seriousness of side-effects varies greatly depending on quantities consumed. In a study about bromazepam&#x27;s negative effects on psychomotor skills and driving ability, it was noted that 3 mg doses caused minimal impairment. It also appeared that impairment may be tied to methods of testing more so than on the product&#x27;s intrinsic activity.

Moreover, side-effects other than drowsiness, dizziness and ataxia seem to be rare and not experienced by more than a few percent of users. The use of other, comparable medication seems to display an identically moderate side-effect profile.

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
Prolonged use of bromazepam can cause tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug, and as a result, it is a medication which is controlled by international law. It is nonetheless important to note that dependence, long-term use and misuse occur in a minority of cases and are not representative of most patients&#x27; experience with this type of medication.

It shares with other benzodiazepines the risk of abuse, misuse, psychological dependence or physical dependence. A withdrawal study demonstrated both psychological dependence and physical dependence on bromazepam including marked rebound anxiety after 4 weeks chronic use. Those whose dose was gradually reduced experienced no withdrawal.

Patients treated with bromazepam for generalised anxiety disorder were found to experience withdrawal symptoms such as a worsening of anxiety, as well as the development of physical withdrawal symptoms when abruptly withdrawn bromazepam. Abrupt or over rapid withdrawal from bromazepam after chronic use even at therapeutic prescribed doses can lead to a severe withdrawal syndrome including status epilepticus and a condition resembling delerium tremens.

Animal studies have shown that chronic administration of diazepam (or bromazepam) causes a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased turnover of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin, increased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased levels of the catecholamines. During withdrawal of bromazepam or diazepam a fall in tryptophan, serotonin levels occurs as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Changes in the levels of these chemicals in the brain can cause headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia.

===Overdose===

Bromazepam is commonly involved in drug overdoses. A severe bromazepam benzodiazepine overdose may result in an alpha pattern coma type. The toxicity of bromazepam in overdosage increases when combined with other CNS depressant drugs such as alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs. Similarly to other benzodiazepines however, being a positive modulator of certain neuroreceptors and not an agonist, the product has reduced overdose potential compared to older products of the barbiturate class. Its consumption alone is very seldom fatal in healthy adults.

Bromazepam was in 2005 the most common benzodiazepine involved in intentional overdoses in France. Bromazepam has also been responsible for accidental poisonings in companion animals. A review of benzodiazepine poisonings in cats and dogs from 1991 to 1994 found bromazepam to be responsible for significantly more poisonings than any other benzodiazepine.

==Contraindications==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in elderly, pregnant, child, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

===Special populations===

*Globally, bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children.
*In 1987, a team of scientists led by Ochs reported that the elimination half-life, peak , and are significantly elevated and the and volume of distribution significantly lowered in elderly subjects. The clinical consequence is that the elderly should be treated with lower doses than younger patients.
*Bromazepam may affect driving and ability to operate machinery.
*Bromazepam is pregnancy category D, a classification that means that bromazepam has been shown to cause harm to the unborn child. The Hoffman LaRoche product information leaflet warns against breast feeding while taking bromazepam. There has been at least one report of sudden infant death syndrome linked to breast feeding while consuming bromazepam.

== Interactions ==

Cimetidine, fluvoxamine and propranolol causes a marked increase in the elimination half-life of bromazepam leading to increased accumulation of bromazepam.

==Society and culture==

===Drug misuse===

Bromazepam has a similar misuse risk as other benzodiazepines such as diazepam. In France car accidents involving psychotropic drugs in combination with alcohol (itself a major contributor) found benzodiazepines, mainly diazepam, nordiazepam, and bromazepam, to be the most common drug present in the blood stream, almost twice that of the next-most-common drug cannabis. Bromazepam has also been used in serious criminal offences including robbery, homicide, and sexual assault.

===Brand names===
It is marketed under several brand names, including, Brozam, Lectopam, Lexomil, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium, Lexatin, Calmepam, Zepam and Lexotanil.

===Legal status===
Bromazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

<text>Aaron&#x27;s beard may refer to the following plants having numerous stamens or threadlike runners:
*&quot;Cymbalaria muralis&quot; (Ivy-leaved toadflax, Kenilworth ivy), native to south and southwest Europe
*&quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; (Great St. John&#x27;s-wort, Jerusalem star), widely cultivated.
*&quot;Opuntia leucotricha&quot; (Arborescent prickly pear, Aaron&#x27;s beard cactus), a species of prickly pear cactus, endemic to Mexico.
*&quot;Saxifraga stolonifera&quot; (Creeping saxifrage, strawberry geranium), native to Asia.
*&quot;Spiraea salicifolia&quot; (Bridewort, willow-leaved meadowsweet), native to Eurasia, cultivated 

The name derives from a Biblical quotation referring to the patriarch Aaron:
&quot;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#x27;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments&quot;-- Psalm 133:1-2 (King James Version)

<doc id="1120705" wikidata="Q164056" url="?curid=1120705" title="Barbarea verna">
<text>Barbarea verna is a biennial herb in the family Brassicaceae. Common names include land cress, American cress, bank cress, black wood cress, Belle Isle cress, Bermuda cress, poor man&#x27;s cabbage, early yellowrocket, early wintercress, scurvy cress, creasy greens, and upland cress. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and naturalized elsewhere It has been cultivated as a leaf vegetable in England since the 17th century. As it requires less water than watercress, it is easier to cultivate.

==Description==
Annual or biennial, winter green, herbaceous plant in the Brassicaceae. The seeds typically germinate in the autumn to form an over-wintering rosette. The following spring, it grows a main stem up to about 90 cm, sometimes up to 130 cm, which is pale green, groovy (sulcate) and occasionally branched. The leaves are alternate and pinnate with clasping auricles at the base and between 4 and 11 pairs of sub-opposite lobes. The upper leaves have much narrower lobes than those found lower down. The whole plant is almost entirely glabrous.

The flowers appear in early spring. The inflorescence is a terminal raceme, or lateral raceme arising from the leaf axils, with 6 to 25 flowers on short 3-8mm pedicels. There are four yellowy green sepals, 5mm long and four bright yellow petals each 8mm long. Six stamens and one style with a capitate stigma at the tip.

==Uses==
Land cress is considered a satisfactory substitute for watercress. It can be used in sandwiches, or salads, or cooked like spinach, or used in soup.

Land cress can be grown easily in any garden. Like watercress, it loves water, but does not do well when partially submerged for long periods of time. This plant needs full sun or partial shade and moist or poorly drained soil. It is a common green in Appalachian cuisine as one of few plants that can overwinter in the mountains.

Other common names include dryland cress, cassabully, and American watercress. When cooked similarly to Southern collard greens the leaves may be called creasy greens. A variegated form is available.

<doc id="1120706" wikidata="Q2368376" url="?curid=1120706" title="Richard of Devizes">
<text>Richard of Devizes (fl. late 12th century), English chronicler, was a monk of St Swithin&#x27;s house at Winchester.

His birthplace is probably indicated by his surname, Devizes in Wiltshire, but not much is known about his life. He is credited by Bale with the composition of the &quot;Annales de Wintonia&quot;, which are edited by Henry Richards Luard in the second volume of the &quot;Annales Monastici&quot;. If this statement be correct, then the chronicler survived King Richard I of England.

In his account of the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189 he was the first person to use the word holocaust when he described the mass murder of the Jews of London, although the use of this word simply refers to a &quot; whole (&quot;holos&quot;) burnt (&quot;kaustos&quot;)&quot; sacrificial offering to a god.

:&quot;Now in the year of our Lord&#x27;s incarnation 1189, Richard, the son of King Henry the Second, by Eleanor, and brother of Henry the Third, was consecrated king of the English by Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster, in the nones of the third of September. On the very day of the coronation, about that solemn hour in which the Son was immolated to the Father, a sacrifice of the Jews to their father, the Devil, was commenced in the city of London, and so long was the duration of this famous mystery that the holocaust could scarcely be accomplished the ensuing day. The other cities and towns of the kingdom emulated the faith of the Londoners, and with a like devotion dispatched their bloodsuckers with blood to hell.&quot;

==Chronicon==
The &quot;Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi&quot; (1192), by which Richard of Devizes is chiefly known, covers only the first three years of King Richard&#x27;s reign; it is practically an account of events in England and the Holy Land during the Third Crusade. The narrator of the chronicle is a French Jewish cobbler giving advice to young French Christians intending to visit England.

For the events of the crusade itself, some consider Richard to be poor authority. But his account of the preparations for the crusade, and of English affairs in the king&#x27;s absence, is valuable, in spite of some possible inaccuracies.

A new reading has emerged recently of the Chronicle mostly due to the inordinate number of classical and biblical references it is laced with (see Anthony P. Bale&#x27;s article, cited below). Rather than a true historic record, Devizes&#x27; account is now being read as an elegant satire and a challenge of contemporary Christian myths against the Jewish community and its mores; particularly those of ritualistic murders of Christian boys by the Jews of Winchester. It is however by no means a defence of the Jewish community. Others have seen the author as intensely conservative, steeped in the prejudices of his order, and can be seen as being hostile to the Jews and to the chancellor, William Longchamp.

Devizes writes in a vivid and epigrammatic style; his Latin shows the effect of the 12th-century Renaissance in its polish and in its reminiscences of classical poets. He describes King John as a raging madman who &quot;emitted foam from his mouth&quot;.

The editions of the &quot;Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi&quot; are:
* by R. Howlett in &quot;Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I&quot;, vol. iii. (Rolls Series, 1886);
* the &quot;Annales de Wintonia&quot; in HR Luard&#x27;s &quot;Annales Monastici&quot;, vol. ii. (Rolls Series, London, 1864–69);
* by John T. Appleby in &quot;The chronicle of Richard of Devizes of the time of King Richard the First&quot; (Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons Ltd, 1963).

<text>Fengtai District () is a district of the city of Beijing. It lies mostly to the southwest of the city center, extending into the city&#x27;s southwestern suburbs beyond the Sixth Ring Road, but also to the south and, to a smaller extent, the southeast, where it has borders with Chaoyang and Dongcheng.

==History==
The Western Han dynasty Prince Liu Jian and his wife were buried in Dabaotai village in southwestern Fengtai over 2,000 years ago. The tombs were discovered in 1974 and are now open to visitors at the Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum on Fengbo Road.
In Qing Dynasty times, Fengtai was where the Imperial Manchu Army had its camps, trained, and held parades on festive occasions.

It is in area, making it the third-largest precinct in the greater urban part of Beijing, and is home to 790,000 inhabitants.

It is divided into 14 subdistricts of the city proper of Beijing, 2 towns, and 5 townships (2 of which are suburbs of the city proper of Beijing). This precinct is newly urbanized in comparison to those precincts in the old city, and until the mid-1980s, it was still a mostly rural area where pig pens and goat pens were common, and major parts of the precinct had no electricity. It was only during the recent rapid economic development that the precinct was urbanized. Its postal code is 100071.

<text>Blitum bonus-henricus (syn. &quot;Chenopodium bonus-henricus&quot;), also called Good-King-Henry, poor-man&#x27;s asparagus, perennial goosefoot, Lincolnshire spinach, Markery, English mercury, or mercury goosefoot, is a species of goosefoot which is native to much of central and southern Europe.

Good-King-Henry has been grown as a vegetable in cottage gardens for hundreds of years, although this dual-purpose vegetable is now rarely grown and the species is more often considered a weed.

==Description==
It is an annual or perennial plant growing up to tall. The leaves are long and broad, triangular to diamond-shaped, with a pair of broad pointed lobes near the base, with a slightly waxy, succulent texture. The flowers are produced in a tall, nearly leafless spike long; each flower is very small ( in diameter), greenish, with five sepals. The seeds are reddish-green, 2–3 mm in diameter.

==Taxonomy==
The species was described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus as &quot;Chenopodium bonus-henricus&quot; in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Until 2012, the species was usually included in genus &quot;Chenopodium&quot;, but molecular genetical research revealed that it does not really belong to this genus. It seems to be more closely related to the genus &quot;Spinacia&quot;, and is now placed in the genus &quot;Blitum&quot; in the tribe Anserineae. The scientific name &quot;Blitum bonus-henricus&quot; was first used by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1832.

Synonyms basing on the same type specimen are: &quot;Agathophytum bonus-henricus&quot; , &quot;Anserina bonus-henricus&quot; , &quot;Atriplex bonus-henricus&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium bonus-henricus&quot; , &quot;Orthospermum bonus-henricus&quot; , and &quot;Orthosporum bonus-henricus&quot; Heterotypic synonyms are: &quot;Blitum perenne&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium hastatum&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium ruderale&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium ruderale&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium sagittatum&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium spinacifolium&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium triangulare&quot; , &quot;Chenopodium triangularifolia&quot; , and &quot;Orthosporum unctuosum&quot; .

== Distribution and habitat ==
It can be found throughout Britain and Europe generally, except in the southeast.

== Uses ==
Cropping can begin in spring. Some of the new shoots can be thinned out as they appear (usually from mid-spring to early summer) and cooked like asparagus. All cutting should then cease so that shoots are allowed to develop. The succulent triangular leaves may be harvested a few at a time until the end of August and eaten raw or cooked like spinach. The flower buds can be cooked as well.

The rough, nettle-like leaves can be ovate-cordate shaped with a width of or ovate-oblong with a width of . The leaves are separated into a leaf blade and a petiole. The petiole has a length of and becomes shorter towards the stem apex. Similar to the potato, &quot;S. affinis&quot; grows rhizomes which are approximately long and thick. By medullary primary growth they thicken primarily on the internodes and less on the nodes. This way at irregular intervals constricted tubers are formed, which are usually thinner on both ends. The tubers are covered with a thin, pale-beige-to-ivory skin. The flesh underneath is white and tender.

=== Compounds ===
Vacuoles in the tuber of &quot;S. affinis&quot; are rich in stachyose. Stachyose is a tetrasaccharide, consist out of galactose, glucose and fructose. Stachyose is evaluated to be about 230 mg/kg in dry tubers.

== Origin and history ==
&quot;S. affinis&quot; originates from central and northern China. It had been cultivated in China by the 13th century.

Before &quot;S. affinis&quot; was introduced to Europe, a related crop named &quot;S. palustris&quot; was collected in nature to be consumed as a vegetable. Later on the Germanic peoples used &quot;S. recta,&quot; another relative of &quot;S. affinis&quot;, as a medicinal plant. The plant was then cultivated from the 18th century onwards. In 1882 the crop was cultivated on a farm for the first time in Crosne. &quot;S. affinis&quot; is the only labiate which is cultivated as vegetable in Europe. At the beginning of the 20th century &quot;S. affinis&quot; became more and more popular until it was abandoned again in the 1970s due to problems with viruses and the plant&#x27;s strong vagility (tendency to spread). Since 1990 there has been a rise in the cultivation of &quot;S. affinis&quot; with availability in some markets and grocery stores. The plant is listed in the &quot;Handbook of Alien Species in Europe&quot; as an invasive plant in Europe.

== Taxonomy ==
The plant is part of the family Lamiaceae. A later described species, named &quot;S. sieboldii&quot;, in dedication to the German-Dutch botanist and japanologist Philipp Franz von Siebold, is considered to be a synonym.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;S. affinis&quot; is planted as a bulb (vegetative) in spring (March–May). Multiple bulbs are planted deep into a hole of dimensions . The plant can achieve a height of . Weeding is necessary but it is important not to damage the root system. A sufficient water supply during summer is important.

Harvest is from November to March. It is important that the soil is not frozen when harvesting.

The storage of &quot;S. affinis&quot; tubers is difficult. Because of their thin skin, they can be stored only for a few days, about a week in a fridge. An alternative can be a fresh ongoing harvesting out of humid sand, thereby the tubers stay fresh for several months.

== Usage ==

=== Culinary ===
The tubers have a crunchy texture and a sweet, nutty flavour. They can be eaten raw, pickled, dried or cooked. A wide range of uses for this vegetable leads to various dishes in the cuisine of many countries. They can be prepared similarly to Jerusalem artichokes. The leaves can be dried and made into a tea.

In Chinese and Japanese cuisine, &quot;S. affinis&quot; is primarily pickled. In particular, its tuber is a part of , cooked for celebrating Japanese New Year. Dyed red by leaves of &quot;Perilla&quot; (red ) after being pickled, it is called . In Korea it is called ().

In French cuisine, its cooked tuber is often served alongside dishes named &quot;japonaise&quot; or Japanese-styled.

=== Medicinal ===
In traditional Chinese medicine, the entirety of &quot;S. affinis&quot; is used as an agent to treat colds and pneumonia.

In addition, root extract of &quot;S. affinis&quot; has shown antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, Baek &quot;et al.&quot; observed antioxidant activity in 2004. Also in 2004 inhibitory effects on acetylcholine esterase, monoamine oxidase and xanthine oxidase activities were observed in rat brains after 20 days of feeding with methanolic extracts of &quot;S. affinis.&quot; Ethanol extract from this plant also seems to have antitumour activity.

<text>Irving Babbitt (August 2, 1865 – July 15, 1933) was an American academic and literary critic, noted for his founding role in a movement that became known as the New Humanism, a significant influence on literary discussion and conservative thought in the period between 1910 and 1930. He was a cultural critic in the tradition of Matthew Arnold and a consistent opponent of romanticism, as represented by the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Politically he can, without serious distortion, be called a follower of Aristotle and Edmund Burke. He was an advocate of classical humanism but also offered an ecumenical defense of religion. His humanism implied a broad knowledge of various moral and religious traditions. His book &quot;Democracy and Leadership&quot; (1924) is regarded as a classic text of political conservatism. Babbitt is regarded as a major influence over American cultural and political conservatism.

==Early career==
Babbitt was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Augusta (Darling) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt. He moved with his family over much of the USA while a young child. He was brought up from age 11 in Madisonville, a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. He entered Harvard College in 1885. On graduation in 1889 he took a post teaching classics at the College of Montana. After two years, he went to study in France, at the &quot;École Pratique des Hautes-études&quot; linked to the Sorbonne. There he studied Pali literature and Buddhism, for a year. Then he took a master&#x27;s degree at Harvard, including Sanskrit.

==Harvard==
At this point, he moved away from a career as a classical scholar, taking a teaching position at Williams College in romance languages — just for one year, as it turned out. He then was offered in 1894 an instructor&#x27;s position, again at Harvard, in French. He was to stay at Harvard, rising from the ranks to become a full professor of French literature in 1912. He is credited with introducing the study of comparative literature there.

He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921.

The position of &quot;Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature&quot; was endowed by Harvard University in 1960 and awarded to its first recipient, Harry Levin. The National Humanities Institute runs an &quot;Irving Babbitt Project&quot;.

==New Humanism==
It was in the early 1890s that he first allied himself with Paul Elmer More in developing the core doctrines that were to constitute what he called the &quot;New Humanism&quot;. In 1895 he gave a lecture &quot;What is Humanism?&quot;, which announced his attack on Rousseau. At the time, Babbitt had switched out of classical studies. He would later declare his opposition to contemporary textual and philological scholarship, associated with German scholarship, as a finite task, which he was unhappy to see placed above teaching based on what he felt was the &quot;eternal&quot; moral and spiritual content of literary masterpieces. His ideas, and More&#x27;s, were characteristically written as short pieces or essays that were later gathered into books. Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Literature and the American College&quot;, although assembled from writings already circulated, caused a stir when published in 1908.

He continued to publish in the same vein, often denouncing authors from his avowed specialty, French literature. He also criticized Francis Bacon and denounced literary naturalism and utilitarianism.

His central emphasis was on the individual moral character and human reason. He put stress on self-discipline and the need to control impulses seeking liberation from all restraints. He opposed naturalism on the grounds that it emphasizes the dominance of external natural forces over the strength of character and individual conscience. He denounced romanticism; and especially its chief propagator, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He warned that Rousseau was the chief negative influence over modern culture. He opposed overt sentimentalism, celebration of human perfection and utopian thinking of romanticism. His views were in the tradition of classical pre-romantic literature.

==&quot;Democracy and Leadership&quot;==
In 1924, Babbitt published, which is perhaps his best-known work; &quot;Democracy and Leadership&quot;. The book deals with his political views from his humanistic outlook. In it, he discussed and criticized political theories which derive from naturalism. Babbitt criticized two sides of naturalistic thoughtmechanistic or utilitarian side, propagated by Francis Bacon and the sentimental side, represented by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Babbitt attacked both for giving too much importance to forces of nature and unrestrained human passion and impulses; while ignoring the fundamental importance of individual conscience and moral character. He rejected historical deterministic theories from Saint Augustine to Bossuet. He stated high moral character as the most important quality of leadership in a democratic society. He warned against the dangers of unchecked majoritarianism in democracies.

Babbitt&#x27;s political views are in the tradition of classical liberalism, from Aristotle and Edmund Burke. His book is considered as a classic conservative political work. Conservative scholars like Russell Kirk were influenced by Babbitt. Kirk praised the book as &quot;...one of the few truly important works of political thought.&quot;

His political views originated from his belief in the supreme importance of moral character. He rejected socio-political activism and sentimentalism as no substitute for individual conscience and character. He put stress on individual responsibility and opposed &quot;everybody&#x27;s interference in everybody else&#x27;s business.&quot;

==Criticism, influence and legacy==
He met with increasing criticism down the years: those provoked into announcing their opposition included R. P. Blackmur, Oscar Cargill, Ernest Hemingway, Harold Laski, Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Joel Elias Spingarn, Allen Tate, and Edmund Wilson. In the case of Mencken, at least, Babbitt gave as good as he got; he branded Mencken&#x27;s writing as &quot;intellectual vaudeville.&quot;

He had an early influence on T. S. Eliot, a student of his at Harvard. Eliot in his 1926 essay &quot;The Humanism of Irving Babbitt&quot;, a review of &quot;Democracy and Leadership&quot;, had become equivocal, finding Babbitt&#x27;s humanism not sufficiently receptive to Christian dogma; his position &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; religion is still debated.

The identifiable figures of the New Humanist movement, besides Babbitt and More, were mostly influenced by Babbitt on a personal level and included G. R. Elliott (1883-1963), Norman Foerster (1887-1972), Frank Jewett Mather (1868-1953), Robert Shafer (1889-1956) and Stuart Pratt Sherman (1881-1926). Of these, Sherman moved away early, and Foerster, a star figure, later reconsidered and veered towards the New Criticism.

More peripherally, Yvor Winters and the Great Books movement are supposed to have taken something from New Humanism. Scholars influenced by Babbitt include Milton Hindus, Russell Kirk, Nathan Pusey, Peter Viereck, Richard M. Weaver, Claes G. Ryn, and George Will. A relationship has been traced between Babbitt and Gordon Keith Chalmers, Walter Lippmann, Louis Mercier, and Austin Warren; however, claims of influence where it is not acknowledged are not easy to sustain, and Babbitt was known to advise against public tributes.

From a position of high prominence in the 1920s, having the effective but questionable support of &quot;The Bookman&quot;, New Humanism experienced a drop from fashionable status after Babbitt died in 1933 and modernist and progressive currents became increasingly dominant in American intellectual, cultural and political life. By the 1940s its enemies pronounced it nearly extinct, but Babbitt continued to exercise a partly hidden influence, and a marked revival of interest was seen in the 1980s and ensuing decades. Babbitt is often name-checked in discussions on cultural conservatism. Babbitt&#x27;s influence in China, which was notable in the 1930s and 40s, is again on the rise with the publication of many books by or about Babbitt.

==Personal life==
Babbitt married Dora May (née Drew) Babbitt on June 12, 1900, with whom he had two children: Esther and Edward Sturges.

He died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 15, 1933.

<doc id="1120729" wikidata="Q369931" url="?curid=1120729" title="Master-at-arms">
<text>A master-at-arms (US: MA; UK and some Commonwealth: MAA) may be a naval rating, responsible for law enforcement, regulating duties, security, anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) for a country&#x27;s navy; an army officer responsible for physical training; or a member of the crew of a merchant ship (usually a passenger vessel) responsible for security and law enforcement. In some navies, a ship&#x27;s corporal is a position—not the rank—of a petty officer who assists the master-at-arms in his various duties. Historically, a master-at-arms was responsible for the training of soldiers during peace time, or actively involved in leading the defense of a fortification during war time.

In some countries, the term &quot;navy police&quot; is used for a part of a navy responsible for law enforcement, such as the Royal Navy Police, known as the Royal Navy Regulating Branch until 2007.

== United Kingdom ==
=== Royal Navy ===
The master-at-arms (MAA) is a ship&#x27;s senior rating, normally carrying the rank of chief petty officer or warrant officer. They are in charge of discipline aboard ship, assisted by regulators of the Royal Navy Police, of which they are a member. The non-substantive (trade) badge of an MAA is a crown within a wreath.

The post of master-at-arms was introduced to the Royal Navy during the reign of King Charles I; their original duties were to be responsible for the ship&#x27;s small arms and edged weapons, and to drill the ship&#x27;s company in their use. This was not an onerous task, and masters-at-arms came to be made responsible for &quot;regulating duties&quot;; their role as weapons instructors was eventually taken over by the chief gunner.

The MAA is addressed as &quot;Master&quot; if holding the rank of chief petty officer, regardless of gender, and is often nicknamed the &quot;jaunty&quot;, a corruption of the French gendarme, or the &quot;joss/jossman&quot;.

As a result of the Armed Forces Act 2006, the term Regulating Branch was changed to Service Police and the branch title changed to the Royal Navy Police and reported to their respective service&#x27;s Provost Marshal, who was responsible to the First Sea Lord.

=== British Army ===
In the British Army, a master-at-arms is an officer of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, posted as an SO2 or SO3 at divisional headquarters or higher command, and responsible for overseeing all fitness training in subordinate units. The role is filled by RAPTC WO1s at brigade headquarters, while WO2s or staff sergeant PTIs are embedded at unit level.

== United States Navy ==

In the United States Navy, the master-at-arms rating is responsible for law enforcement, investigations, K-9, expeditionary, and anti-terrorism/force protection operations. It is one of the oldest ratings in the United States Navy, having been recognized since the Navy&#x27;s inception.

<doc id="1120730" wikidata="Q330332" url="?curid=1120730" title="Mr. Bean's Holiday">
<text>Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday is a 2007 comedy film directed by Steve Bendelack and written by Hamish McColl and Robin Driscoll, from a story penned by Simon McBurney. Based on the British sitcom series &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis, it is a standalone sequel to &quot;Bean&quot; (1997). The film stars Atkinson as Mr. Bean, with Maxim Baldry, Emma de Caunes, Willem Dafoe and Karel Roden in supporting roles. In the film, Mr. Bean wins a trip to Cannes, France, but on his way there, he is mistaken for a kidnapper and meets an award-winning filmmaker after he travels with both a Russian filmmaker&#x27;s son and an aspiring actress in tow.

Produced by StudioCanal, Working Title Films and Tiger Aspect Films, the film was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007 and in the United States on 24 August 2007 by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $232.2 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.

==Plot==

Mr. Bean wins a holiday trip to Cannes, a video camera, and €200 in a raffle. Upon arriving in France, Bean causes chaos while trying French seafood cuisine at Le Train Bleu and asks Russian film director Emil Duchevsky to film him boarding his train using his video camera at the Gare de Lyon. However, the two keep doing retakes at Bean&#x27;s request until the train leaves with Bean and Duchevsky&#x27;s son, Stepan, onboard and Duchevsky left behind.
Bean and Stepan bond and get off together at the next station, which Duchevsky&#x27;s train passes through without stopping; Duchevsky holds up a sign with a mobile phone number written on it for Stepan to call, but inadvertently obscures the last two digits. After Bean unsuccessfully calls the number with various combinations of digits in place of the unknown ones, another train arrives and the two get on. They are promptly ejected in Cavaillon as Bean had accidentally left his wallet, passport and ticket at the previous stop.

To earn money, Bean busks as a mime and buys himself and Stepan food and bus tickets to Cannes. However, Bean&#x27;s ticket is caught in the wind and eventually stuck on the foot of a chicken, which is then packed into a farmer&#x27;s truck. Bean chases the vehicle via bicycle to a farm, where he is unable to locate his ticket due to the large number of chickens there. Following an unsuccessful hitchhiking attempt, he continues his journey alone on foot. Sometime later, Bean awakes on the set of an elaborate yogurt commercial directed by American filmmaker Carson Clay and starring aspiring actress Sabine, in which a quaint French village is under attack from Nazi soldiers. Mistaken for an extra, Bean briefly stars in the commercial as one of the soldiers before being dismissed for showing his video camera in the advert, and accidentally causes the set to explode while recharging his camera.

Continuing to hitchhike, Bean is picked up by a Mini identical to his own driven by Sabine, who is on her way to the Cannes Film Festival, where her debut film directed by Clay, &quot;Playback Time&quot;, is to be presented. They stop at a service station, where Bean reunites with Stepan. Sabine takes him with them, believing Stepan to be Bean&#x27;s son. The next morning, the trio arrive in Cannes thanks to Bean driving through the night after Sabine falls asleep.

At a petrol station, Sabine sees on the news that she and Bean are suspected of kidnapping Stepan. In a rush to &quot;Playback Time&quot;&#x27;s premiere, rather than head to the police to clear the misunderstandings, she has Bean and Stepan disguised as her mother and daughter to avoid detection at the festival. During the premiere, the audience shows complete disinterest in &quot;Playback Time&quot;, which centers on a homicide detective&#x27;s pining for a lost love. Sabine discovers that her role has been cut, prompting Bean to plug his video camera into the projector and replace the film&#x27;s visuals with his video diary. The footage aligns well with the film&#x27;s narration to present Sabine as the hero&#x27;s lost love and Bean as her new lover. Clay, Sabine and Bean all receive a standing ovation, which becomes more enthusiastic when Stepan is reunited with his parents onstage.

Bean exits through the theatre&#x27;s back door and finally arrives at the Cannes beach as desired, where he, Sabine, Stepan, Clay, and other people mime to the song &quot;La Mer&quot;.

==Production==

Plans for a second &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; film were first revealed in February 2001, when Rowan Atkinson - who was filming &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; at the time - was lured into developing a sequel to &quot;Bean&quot; (1997), from a script written by &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; co-creator Richard Curtis that would have followed Mr. Bean heading to Australia under the working title &quot;Down Under Bean&quot;. No further announcements regarding the film were made until early 2005.

In March 2005, the film was officially announced, then titled &quot;Bean 2&quot;, with Simon McBurney, co-founder and artistic director of the Théâtre de Complicité theatre company, writing the film&#x27;s script. McBurney chose to set the film in France because it was a place where the visual-oriented Mr. Bean would not be expected to talk much, due to his limited knowledge of French. In December of that year, Atkinson announced that he would script the film himself alongside Curtis, though the final screenplay was instead written by Robin Driscoll (a writer on the TV series) and Hamish McColl, while McBurney wrote the film&#x27;s story and served as one of the executive producers on the film alongside Curtis.

Principal photography for the film began on 15 May 2006 and took place on location across England and France, particularly during the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. At that point, the film&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;Bean 2&quot; to &quot;French Bean&quot;, and later to &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, a reference to the 1953 French comedy film &quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, which served as an inspiration for the character of Mr. Bean.

Mr. Bean saying &quot;Gracias&quot; to French people was inspired by McBurney&#x27;s great uncle, who told McBurney&#x27;s father that he had no trouble with the language barrier during his tour of Europe because he knew the essential French word &quot;Gracias&quot;.

Atkinson said that despite the great length of time since he had last portrayed Mr. Bean, he had no trouble getting back into the character. Atkinson reflected in 2022 that since he was neither an athlete nor a cyclist, he found the cycling sequence to be the most difficult thing he had ever done as Mr. Bean.

===Music===
The film score was composed and conducted by Howard Goodall, who also composed the original &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; series, although the original &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; theme was unused. In contrast to the series&#x27; use of simple musical repetitions, the film uses a symphonic orchestration, which is a sophisticated score that features catchy leitmotifs for particular characters or scenes. The film&#x27;s theme song was a cover of the Primitives&#x27; song &quot;Crash&quot; by Matt Willis.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; served as the official film for Red Nose Day 2007, with money made from the film going to the telethon&#x27;s charity Comic Relief. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, a new and exclusive Mr. Bean sketch titled &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Wedding&quot; was broadcast on the telethon for Comic Relief on BBC One on 16 March 2007.

The official premiere of the film took place at the Odeon Leicester Square on Sunday, 25 March and helped to raise money for both Comic Relief and the Oxford Children&#x27;s Hospital. Universal Pictures released a teaser trailer for the film in November 2006 and launched an official website online the following month.

&quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; was released on DVD and HD DVD on 27 November 2007, and on Blu-ray on 16 April 2019.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; opened in the United States on 24 August 2007 alongside &quot;War&quot; and &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot;, and grossed $9,889,780 in its opening weekend while playing in 1,714 theaters, with a $5,770 per-theater average and ranking fourth at the box office. The film then closed on 18 October 2007 with a final domestic gross of $33,302,167 and a final international gross of $198,923,741. Culminating in a worldwide total of $232,225,908, the film has become commercially successful considering its $25 million budget. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007 and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends, before being dethroned by &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 51% based on 115 reviews with an average rating of 5.40/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; means well, but good intentions can&#x27;t withstand the 90 minutes of monotonous slapstick and tired, obvious gags.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 56 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

BBC film critic Paul Arendt gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to explain the appeal of Mr. Bean. At first glance, he seems to be moulded from the primordial clay of nightmares: a leering man-child with a body like a tangle of tweed-coated pipe cleaners and the gurning, window-licking countenance of a suburban sex offender. It&#x27;s a testament to Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s skill that, by the end of the film he seems almost cuddly.&quot; Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; referred to the character of Mr. Bean as a &quot;dim-witted sub-Hulot loner&quot; and said the plot involves Atkinson &quot;getting in touch with his retarded inner child&quot;. French also said &quot;the best joke (Bean on an old bike riding faster than a team of professional cyclists) is taken directly from Tati&#x27;s &quot;Jour de Fete&quot;.&quot; Wendy Ide of &quot;The Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said &quot;It has long been a mystery to the British, who consider Bean to be, at best, an ignoble secret weakness, that Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s repellent creation is absolutely massive on the Continent.&quot; Ide said parts of the film are reminiscent of &quot;City of God&quot;, &quot;The Straight Story&quot; and said two scenes are &quot;clumsily borrowed&quot; from &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. Ide also wrote that the jokes are weak and one gag &quot;was past its sell-by date ten years ago&quot;.

Steve Rose of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying that the film was full of awfully weak gags, and &quot;In a post-Borat world, surely there&#x27;s no place for Bean&#x27;s antiquated fusion of Jacques Tati, Pee-Wee Herman and John Major?&quot;, while Colm Andrew of the &quot;Manx Independent&quot; said &quot;the flimsiness of the character, who is essentially a one-trick pony, starts to show&quot; and his &quot;continual close-up gurning into the camera&quot; becomes tiresome. Peter Rainer of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; and said, &quot;Since Mr. Bean rarely speaks a complete sentence, the effect is of watching a silent movie with sound effects. This was also the dramatic ploy of the great French director-performer Jacques Tati, who is clearly the big influence here.&quot; Amy Biancolli of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying &quot;Don&#x27;t mistake this simpleton hero, or the movie&#x27;s own simplicity, for a lack of smarts. &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; is quite savvy about filmmaking, landing a few blows for satire.&quot; Biancolli said the humour is &quot;all elementally British and more than a touch French. What it isn&#x27;t, wasn&#x27;t, should never attempt to be, is American. That&#x27;s the mistake made by Mel Smith and the ill-advised forces behind 1997&#x27;s &quot;Bean: The Movie&quot;.&quot;

Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;Either you&#x27;ll find [Atkinson] hilarious—or he&#x27;ll seem like one of those awful, tedious comedians who only thinks he&#x27;s hilarious.&quot; Burr also said &quot;There are also a few gags stolen outright from Tati&quot;, but concluded &quot;Somewhere, Jacques Tati is smiling.&quot; Tom Long of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; said, &quot;Watching 90 minutes of this stuff—we&#x27;re talking broad, broad comedy here—may seem a bit much, but this film actually picks up steam as it rolls along, becoming ever more absurd.&quot; and also &quot;Mr. Bean offers a refreshingly blunt reminder of the simple roots of comedy in these grim, overly manufactured times.&quot;

Suzanne Condie Lambert of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;Atkinson is a gifted physical comedian. And the film is a rarity: a kid-friendly movie that was clearly not produced as a vehicle for selling toys and video games&quot;, but also said that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to laugh at a character I&#x27;m 95 percent sure is autistic.&quot; Lawrence Toppman of &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; gave the film 2½ stars out of 4 and said &quot;If you like [the character], you will certainly like &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday,&quot; a 10-years-later sequel to &quot;Bean.&quot; I found him intermittently funny yet almost unrelentingly creepy&quot;, and also &quot;Atkinson doesn&#x27;t have the deadpan elegance of a Buster Keaton or the wry, gentle physicality of a Jacques Tati (whose &quot;Mr. Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot; inspired the title). He&#x27;s funniest when mugging shamelessly...&quot;

Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that &quot;the disasters instigated by Bean&#x27;s haplessness quickly become tiresome and predictable&quot; but said that one scene later in the film &quot;is worth sticking around for&quot;. Elizabeth Weitzman of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said &quot;If you&#x27;ve never been particularly fond of Atkinson&#x27;s brand of slapstick, you certainly won&#x27;t be converted by this trifle.&quot; and also &quot;If the title sounds familiar, it&#x27;s because Atkinson intends his movie to be an homage to the 1953 French classic &quot;Mr. Hulot&#x27;s Holiday.&quot; Mr. Hulot was played by one of the all-time great physical comedians, Jacques Tati, and that movie is a genuine delight from start to finish. This version offers a few laughs and an admirable commitment to old-fashioned fun.&quot; Phil Villarreal of the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; gave the film 2 stars and said &quot;If you&#x27;ve seen 10 minutes of Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s Mr. Bean routine, you&#x27;ve seen it all&quot;, and &quot;The Nazi stuff is a bit out of place in a G-rated movie. Or any movie, really&quot;, later calling Atkinson &quot;a has-Bean&quot;. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and said &quot;If you&#x27;ve been lobotomized or have the mental age of a kindergartener, &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; is viable comic entertainment&quot; and also, &quot;The film, set mostly in France, pays homage to Jacques Tati, but the mostly silent gags feel like watered-down Bean.&quot;

===Accolades===
Max Baldry was nominated for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actor at the 29th Young Artist Awards in 2008. The film was nominated as &quot;Comedy or Musical and Best Comedy&quot; at the First National Movie Awards in 2007.

<text>Baron Gerard Jacob De Geer (20 November 1858 – 24 July 1943) was a Swedish geologist who made significant contributions to Quaternary geology, particularly geomorphology and geochronology. De Geer is best known for his work on varves. In 1890 De Geer was the first to apply the name Ancylus Lake to the Baltic paleolake discovered by Henrik Munthe. He subsequently participated the protracted scientific controversy surrounding this lake.

== Biography ==
Baron Gerard Jacob De Geer comes from a well-known Swedish aristocratic family of Brabant origin, who had emigrated to Sweden in the early seventeenth century. His family included prominent industrialists and politicians. His father Louis and older brother Gerhard Louis served as the Prime Minister of Sweden.

Gerard Jacob was born on October 2, 1858, in Stockholm in the family of Baron Louis Gerhard de Geer, at that time the first Minister of Justice in the Swedish government, and Carolina de Geer, née Countess Wachtmeister. Since 1869 he studied at primary school, and since 1873 - at the Stockholm gymnasium. In 1877, de Geer entered Uppsala University. In May 1879 he graduated and received a Bachelor of Arts degree.

In 1878, De Geer became an employee of the Geological Survey of Sweden, initially freelance, then, since 1882, as an assistant to a geologist, and since 1885, a full-time geologist. At this time he started to study the late Quaternary deposits and landforms of southern Sweden. In 1897, he left his job in the geological service for the position of professor of general and historical geology at Stockholm University.

In 1882, on the recommendation of Otto Martin Torell, de Geer participated in the Swedish expedition to Spitsbergen as part of the first International Polar Year as a staff geologist. This marks the beginning of many years of research on the modern glaciation of the Svalbard archipelago: in total he took part in six expeditions to Svalbard (1882, 1896, 1899, 1901, 1908 and 1910).

Gerard de Geer remained a lecturer at the Department of Geology at the University of Stockholm from 1897 to 1924. At the university, he served as rector (1902-1910) and vice-chancellor from (1911-1924). In addition, De Geer was a member of the Swedish Parliament from 1900 to 1905.

The pinnacle of de Geer&#x27;s scientific career can be considered the receipt of the presidency of the X International Geological Congress, held in Stockholm in 1910. At first he took part in the preparation of the Congress as vice-chairman of the preparatory committee, and from May 1907 - as chairman of the executive committee. Within the framework of the congress, he delivered the now classic lecture &quot;A geochronology of the last 12000 years&quot;. He began this lecture with such words &quot;Geology is the history of the earth, but hitherto it has been a history without years.&quot; At the congress De Geer formally introduced the term varve defining it as any annual sedimentary layer, and also proposed that the term geochronology be restricted to varve dating, other existing techniques being less accurate and precise. By then, observations of the stratigraphic relationship between varved sediment and recessional moraines, and the correlation of varve sequences between geographically distant sites, added more compelling evidence to De Geer&#x27;s essentially circumstantial speculation. The geological community accepted that the couplets were unlikely to represent any period other than the year. In addition, before the start of the Congress, De Geer conducted an excursion for 65 delegates from 14 countries, within the framework of which he examined the Dicksonfjorden on Spitsbergen.

== Main research areas ==
De Geer&#x27;s early studies of raised beaches, used to reconstruct glacio-isostatic sea level changes, and his mapping of glacial moraines to reconstruct the extent of the last Scandinavian ice sheet and its pattern of deglaciation (the particular type of moraine he studied is now referred to as &quot;De Geer moraine&quot;), were well received. However, De Geer is most famous for discovering varves and pioneering their use in geochronology.

During fieldwork in 1878, De Geer noticed that the appearance of laminated sediments deposited in glacial lakes at the margin of the retreating Scandinavian ice sheet at the end of the last ice age, closely resembled tree-rings. In his best known work &quot;Geochronologia Sueccia&quot;, published in 1940, De Geer wrote &quot;From the obvious similarity with the regular, annual rings of the trees I got at once the impression that both ought to be annual deposits&quot; (1940, p. 13).

While this observation was not new, De Geer was the first geologist to exploit its potential application. De Geer called these annual sedimentary layers varves and throughout the 1880s further developed his theory, publishing a brief outline of his discovery in 1882, which he followed with a presentation to the Swedish Geological Society in 1884. It was not until 1910, at the International Geological Congress, that De Geer&#x27;s pioneering work reached the wider international scientific community.

=== The Swedish Time Scale ===
In 1897 De Geer was appointed professor of geology at Stockholm University, and went on to become the university&#x27;s president from 1902 to 1910. With the help of numerous students from both Stockholm and Uppsala, De Geer began to piece together short, but overlapping, varve sequences in south east Sweden to create a longer year-by-year chronology of glacial retreat for the Lateglacial period. The urban expansion of Stockholm provided perfect conditions for De Geer and his colleagues, who made good use of numerous exposures of laminated sediment in the many pits and cuttings that exposed the glacial lake sediments of the Baltic basin. Estuarine sediments exposed along the valley of the Angermanalven River, allowed De Geer to further extend the chronology into the early Holocene. The resulting varve chronology was called the Swedish Time Scale, and geologists outside Sweden soon followed suit using varved sediments to build high-resolution chronologies of glacial retreat, most notably Matti Sauramo in Finland.

== Global expeditions, teleconnections, and controversy ==
De Geer firmly believed the main control on varve sedimentation was solar radiation acting on glacier meltwater production, and that consequently, varved sediments represented a &quot;..gigantic, natural self-registering thermograph&quot; (De Geer 1926) and varve curves (varve thickness plotted against varve number or year), which he often referred to as &quot;solar curves&quot;, a reliable proxy for past changes in solar radiation. Ultimately, De Geer hoped his studies of varves would explain the fundamental cause of Ice Ages - &quot;If the last glaciation everywhere should show to be synchronous and the origin of the last Ice Age thus to be of a general nature, the assumption of a cosmic cause would scarcely be avoidable.&quot;

In 1915 De Geer matched, or &#x27;teleconnected&quot;, varve curves from Sweden to varve curves from Finland and Norway. This first attempt at long-distance correlation marked the start of two decades travelling around the world by De Geer and his colleagues, searching out varve sequences for potential teleconnections. In 1920 De Geer travelled to North America with his wife and two assistants, Ernst Antevs and Ragnar Liden. Antevs remained in North America at the end of the trip, where he worked on the North American varve chronology. Further trips included Erik Norin&#x27;s visit to the Himalayas (1924–1925), Erik Nilsson&#x27;s visit to East Africa (1927–28), and Carl Caldenius&#x27; visit to South America (1925–1929), and later to New Zealand (1932–34).

However, by the mid-1930s De Geer&#x27;s teleconnections had become the subject of increasing criticism from his former student Ernst Antevs. Antevs correctly argued that the teleconnections were bad science, and that De Geer&#x27;s Trans-Atlantic correlations were inaccurate. De Geer felt his position was being caricatured and intentionally misunderstood by Antevs, but did little scientifically to rebuff the criticisms levelled at him.

In 1924 De Geer retired from teaching and became the founder-director of the Geochronological Institute at Stockholm University.

== Geochronologia Suecica Principles ==
In 1940, De Geer published his longest and best-known work &quot;Geochronologia Suecica Principles&quot;, in which he presented part of the Swedish Time Scale in detail, and expounded upon his theories and work regarding varves.

Almost immediately after the publication of &quot;Geochronologia Suecica Principles&quot; De Geer&#x27;s Swedish Time Scale underwent the first of many revisions, as other geologists became involved in the study of varves and more sites were examined.

However, international interest in varves diminished. The bitter dispute between De Geer and Antevs, coupled with the advent of new dating techniques, most importantly radiocarbon dating, showed varves in a bad light.

De Geer died in Stockholm on July 24, 1943. His wife, Ebba Hult De Geer, continued to publish his work, and add to it, into the 1950s.

== Awards and recognition ==
De Geer&#x27;s contributions to geology were recognised in the UK, where the Geological Society awarded De Geer the Wollaston Medal in 1920, and the Royal Society elected De Geer a foreign member in 1930. The ancient DeGeer Sea in modern-day Maritime Canada and the Gulf of Maine was named in his honour.
The Swedish Antarctic Expedition (1901–1904) named a glacier on South Georgia Island in the southern Atlantic Ocean after De Geer. The British would later rename the glacier Harker Glacier after a contemporary English geologist, Alfred Harker.

The valley of De Geerdalen at Spitsbergen, Svalbard is named after him.

== De Geer from a modern perspective ==
De Geer&#x27;s most significant contribution to Quaternary science was unquestionably the identification of varves, and his recognition of their potential in establishing annual chronologies of past climatic and environmental change. The Swedish Time Scale was the most precise and accurate geological timescale of its day, and it is still being improved and added to today. His insistence that varves represented quantifiable proxies for past climate has since been borne out to a degree, but the relationship between varve thickness and hydrometeorological conditions is not as simple as he presumed. Varves have recently experienced a renaissance as methods and techniques of study have improved, and varves are now regularly used to calibrate radiocarbon timescales.

In many ways, De Geer&#x27;s concerns mirror that of modern Quaternary geologists and palaeoclimatologists, particularly his recognition of the need for high-resolution natural archives of past change, and the importance of testing whether global change is synchronous. De Geer&#x27;s principle failing was his faith in teleconnections, where his findings were clearly influenced by his preconceptions. His belief that variations in solar radiation were the principal agent of all climate change has also since been shown to be incorrect. Nevertheless, De Geer asked all the right questions, and his errors can be attributed as much to over-enthusiasm and a single-minded passion, as they can to bad science.

<doc id="1120739" wikidata="Q1368628" url="?curid=1120739" title="Shifty Shellshock">
<text>Seth Brooks Binzer (August 23, 1974 – June 24, 2024), better known by his stage name Shifty Shellshock, was an American rapper and singer-songwriter who cofounded the rap rock band Crazy Town, known for their hit song &quot;Butterfly&quot;. He later had a solo career as well. Binzer struggled with addiction throughout his career and appeared on the reality television series &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; and &quot;Sober House&quot;.

==Music career==
===Crazy Town===
Binzer met fellow Crazy Town frontman Bret Mazur in 1992; they started collaborating under the name &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;. By early 1999, they formed the group &quot;Crazy Town&quot;. In 2000, Crazy Town was signed to tour with Ozzfest. They were kicked out after two weeks when Binzer was arrested for throwing a chair through a window while drunk.

The band&#x27;s single, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, was a global hit. It peaked at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and in several other countries including Austria, Denmark, and Norway. The success of the single prompted sales of their debut album, &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;, to exceed 1.5 million.

Their 2002 follow-up album, &quot;Darkhorse&quot;, was a commercial failure by comparison, and the band broke up shortly after its release.

Crazy Town announced they had reformed in 2007, and performed live for the first time in five years in August 2009. They released their third album, &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;, in 2015.

===Solo career and the Big Shots===
During Crazy Town&#x27;s hiatus, Binzer collaborated with British producer and musician Paul Oakenfold, contributing vocals to Oakenfold&#x27;s hit single &quot;Starry Eyed Surprise&quot;. The track was for Oakenfold&#x27;s first solo studio album &quot;Bunkka&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in the US, Binzer said that the track was created after the pair met at a Crazy Town show.
The song peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number six on the UK Singles Chart.

Binzer released his only solo album, &quot;Happy Love Sick&quot;, in 2004. The first single from the album, &quot;Slide Along Side&quot;, charted in several European countries, including number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 11 in Italy.

In July 2010, Binzer&#x27;s new group, Shifty and the Big Shots, released their first single, &quot;Save Me&quot;.

==Personal life==
Binzer was born in Los Angeles on August 23, 1974; his father, Rollin Binzer, worked as an artist and documentary film director, and his mother, Leslie Brooks, worked as a model and script proofreader. He grew up primarily in Los Angeles with the exception of a brief period in Marblehead, Massachusetts. He began writing rhymes and rap songs by the age of 12.

In a 2001 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Binzer admitted to spending three months in the California Institution for Men following an attempted burglary, to selling and using recreational drugs over a period of several years, as well as to struggling with drug addiction.

Binzer married Melissa Clark in 2002. They had a son named Halo. In 2011, Clark filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Binzer dated Tracy Shelor in 2008. They had a son named Gage.

Binzer began a relationship with British model Jasmine Lennard in 2010. On March 27, 2011, police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance between the pair. Binzer was arrested for outstanding warrants and released later that day. In a video interview with TMZ.com, Binzer stated the disturbance was simply a noise complaint, and that the outstanding warrant was for counter-assaulting a security guard who was using unnecessary force when trying to throw him out of a club. Lennard and Binzer announced their engagement in 2012. Binzer was arrested in February 2012 for battery and cocaine possession, and sentenced to three years&#x27; probation; his relationship with Lennard ended shortly thereafter. Binzer and Lennard had a son named Phoenix. In 2013, Lennard asked a California court for exclusive custody of their son, claiming Binzer smoked crack in front of him and once left a crack pipe in his room.

In 2022, Binzer was dating actress Soleil Moon Frye when he was arrested for DUI in Los Angeles.

===Addiction problems and reality shows===
Following his struggle with substance abuse, Binzer was one of nine celebrities featured in the first season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;. Binzer graduated from treatment with the other cast members in the summer of 2007. His sobriety was short-lived and subsequently he appeared briefly towards the end of &quot;Celebrity Rehab 2&quot;, where Dr. Drew and Binzer&#x27;s sponsor retrieved him from his hotel room where he had been using drugs and brought him to the Pasadena Recovery Center.

Binzer also appeared on a follow-up show titled &quot;Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House&quot;. In July 2008, while shooting scenes for the show, Binzer walked out on production and into a heavy relapse after feeling insulted at a club. William Smith, an employee of Dr. Drew, eventually sought out Binzer at a motel and brought him back to the rehab facility. An embarrassed Binzer pledged to Smith and Dr. Drew that the binge he embarked on was his last. On the show&#x27;s final episode, Binzer is shown in the preliminary stages of being signed to a record producer for a new song, and resolves to stay sober. On the August 30, 2009, episode of &quot;Loveline&quot;, Dr. Drew gave an emotional eulogy to his good friend and Binzer&#x27;s former bandmate DJ AM, who had died two days previously from an accidental drug overdose shortly after breaking 11 years of sobriety. During the tribute, Dr. Drew mentioned that Binzer&#x27;s problems with addiction continued after &quot;Sober House 1&quot;, eventually leading Binzer to take part in &quot;Sober House 2&quot;. When filming for &quot;Sober House 2&quot; began, Dr. Drew got a &quot;distress call&quot; from Binzer and the two met, with Binzer revealing to Drew that his thirst for drugs was still very much active, and that he needed more help. Dr. Drew reluctantly allowed him to take part in the show and firmly stated that it would be the last time Drew gave him treatment. Dr. Drew voiced his hope that Goldstein&#x27;s death would inspire Binzer to remain sober.

===Health problems and death===
On March 29, 2012, Binzer was admitted to a hospital after losing consciousness. He awakened from the coma and was later released from the hospital.

On June 24, 2024, Binzer died at his home in Los Angeles from an accidental overdose of cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamine; he was 49.

<text>The Magnolia Hotel (sometimes called the Magnolia Building, originally the Magnolia Petroleum Building) is a 29-story, Beaux-Arts style, upscale hotel in the Main Street District of downtown Dallas, Texas, that for many years was the tallest building in the state after surpassing the Adolphus Hotel. The structure is a Dallas Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The building, which opened next door to the Adolphus Hotel in August 1922 at a cost of US $4 million, was originally the headquarters for the Magnolia Petroleum Company. In 1934, the company erected its trademark neon Pegasus on the building&#x27;s roof (the Pegasus logo later became the logo of Mobil Oil who merged with Magnolia Petroleum in 1959) to celebrate the American Petroleum Institute&#x27;s annual meeting, held in Dallas for the first time. The rotating winged horse came to represent the city of Dallas and became one of its most recognizable and endearing landmarks, even after the building became obscured by much larger skyscrapers (the neon Pegasus can now only be seen in the downtown skyline approaching from the south).

By 1974, however, Pegasus stopped rotating due to mechanical problems and in 1977 the property was sold to the city of Dallas. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The building was purchased by Denver, Colorado developers in 1997 and was converted into the luxury 330-room Magnolia Hotel.

In 1999, in preparation for Dallas&#x27;s Millennium Celebration, Pegasus was taken down to be completely restored. However, the sign was beyond repair and a new sign was recreated from scratch. At midnight on 1 January 2000, the new Pegasus, complete with rotation, was lit for the first time. A copy of the original sign, which sat atop a Mobil Oil station in the Casa Linda neighborhood of Dallas for many decades, is now on display at the Old Red Museum.

<doc id="1120742" wikidata="Q23041430" url="?curid=1120742" title="Artichoke">
<text>The artichoke (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot; var. &quot;scolymus&quot;), also known by the other names: French artichoke, globe artichoke, and green artichoke in the United States, is a variety of a species of thistle cultivated as food.

The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom. The budding artichoke flower-head is a cluster of many budding small flowers (an inflorescence), together with many bracts, on an edible base. Once the buds bloom, the structure changes to a coarse, barely edible form. Another variety of the same species is the cardoon, a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. Both wild forms and cultivated varieties (cultivars) exist.

==Description==

This vegetable grows to tall, with arching, deeply lobed, silvery, glaucous-green leaves long. The flowers develop in a large head from an edible bud about diameter with numerous triangular scales; the individual florets are purple. The edible portions of the buds consist primarily of the fleshy lower portions of the involucral bracts and the base, known as the &quot;heart&quot;; the mass of immature florets in the center of the bud is called the &quot;choke&quot; or &quot;beard&quot; (which are inedible in older, larger flowers).

==Name==
The English word &quot;artichoke&quot; was borrowed in the sixteenth century from the northern Italian word (the standard modern Italian being ). The Italian term was itself borrowed either from Spanish (today usually ) or directly from the source of the Spanish word—medieval Andalusi Arabic (, including the Arabic definite article ). The Arabic form is still used in Maghrebi Arabic today, while other variants in Arabic include , and Modern Standard Arabic . These Arabic forms themselves derive from classical Arabic () singular word of the plural () meaning &quot;scale&quot;. Other languages which derive their word for the artichoke from Arabic include Israeli Hebrew, which has the word (). The original Hebrew name (see ) is , which is found in the Mishna.

Despite being borrowed from Arabic, European terms for the artichoke have in turn influenced Arabic in their own right. For example, the modern Levantine Arabic term for artichoke is (). This literally means &#x27;earthy thorny&#x27;, and is an Arabicisation (through phono-semantic matching) of the English word &quot;artichoke&quot; or other European terms like it.

As in the case of Levantine Arabic , names for the artichoke have frequently changed form due to folk etymology and phono-semantic matching. The Italian form seems to have been adapted to correspond to Italian (&#x27;arch-, chief&#x27;) and (&#x27;stump&#x27;). Forms of the French word (which also derives from Arabic, possibly via Spanish) have over the years included (corresponding to , &#x27;warm&#x27;) and (corresponding to , &#x27;height&#x27;). Forms found in English have included &quot;hartichoak&quot;, corresponding to &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;choke&quot;, which were likely associated with the belief that the inedible centre of the vegetable could choke its eaters or that the plant can take over a garden, choking out other plants.

== Ecology ==
Artichokes are affected by fungal pathogens including &quot;Verticillium dahliae&quot; and &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot;.

Soil solarization has been successful in other crop-fungus pathosystems and is evaluated for suppression of &quot;V. dahliae&quot; and &quot;R. solani&quot; by Guerrero et al. 2019.

== Cultivation ==

=== Early history ===
The artichoke is a domesticated variety of the wild cardoon (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot;), which is native to the Mediterranean area. There was debate over whether the artichoke was a food among the ancient Greeks and Romans, or whether that cultivar was developed later, with Classical sources referring instead to the wild cardoon. The cardoon is mentioned as a garden plant in the eighth century BCE by Homer and Hesiod. Pliny the Elder mentioned growing of &#x27;carduus&#x27; in Carthage and Cordoba. In North Africa, where it is still found in the wild state, the seeds of artichokes, probably cultivated, were found during the excavation of Roman-period Mons Claudianus in Egypt. 

Varieties of artichokes were cultivated in Sicily beginning in the classical period of the ancient Greeks; the Greeks calling them &quot;kaktos&quot;. In that period, the Greeks ate the leaves and flower heads, which cultivation had already improved from the wild form. The Romans called the vegetable &quot;carduus&quot; (hence the name &quot;cardoon&quot;). Further improvement in the cultivated form appears to have taken place in the medieval period in Muslim Spain and the Maghreb, although the evidence is inferential only. By the twelfth century, it was being mentioned in the compendious guide to farming composed by Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam in Seville (though it does not appear in earlier major Andalusian Arabic works on agriculture), and in Germany by Hildegard von Bingen.

Le Roy Ladurie, in his book &quot;Les paysans de Languedoc&quot;, has documented the spread of artichoke cultivation in Italy and southern France in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, when the artichoke appeared as a new arrival with a new name, which may be taken to indicate an arrival of an improved cultivated variety:

The Dutch introduced artichokes to England, where they grew in Henry VIII&#x27;s garden at Newhall in 1530. From the mid-17th century artichokes &#x27;enjoyed a vogue&#x27; in European courts. The hearts were considered luxury ingredients in the new court cookery as recorded by writers such as François Pierre La Varenne, the author of Le Cuisinier François (1651). It was also claimed, in this period, that artichokes had aphrodisiac properties. They were taken to the United States in the nineteenth century—to Louisiana by French immigrants and to California by Spanish immigrants.

=== Agricultural output ===


Cultivation of the globe artichoke is concentrated in the Americas and the countries bordering the Mediterranean basin. The main European producers are Italy, Spain, and France and the main American producers are Argentina, Peru and the United States. In the United States, California provides nearly 100% of the U.S. crop, with about 80% of that being grown in Monterey County; there, Castroville proclaims itself to be &quot;The Artichoke Center of the World&quot; and holds the annual Castroville Artichoke Festival. More recently, artichokes have been grown in South Africa in a small town called Parys, located along the Vaal River.

In 2020, the world produced approximately 1.5 million tons of artichokes.
Artichokes can be produced from seeds or from vegetative means such as division, root cuttings, or micropropagation. Although technically perennials that normally produce the edible flower during only the second and subsequent years, certain varieties of artichokes can be grown from seed as annuals, producing a limited harvest at the end of the first growing season, even in regions where the plants are not normally winter-hardy. This means home gardeners in northern regions can attempt to produce a crop without the need to overwinter plants with special treatment or protection. The seed cultivar &#x27;Imperial Star&#x27; has been bred to produce in the first year without such measures. An even newer cultivar, &#x27;Northern Star&#x27;, is said to be able to overwinter in more northerly climates, and readily survives subzero temperatures.

Commercial culture is limited to warm areas in USDA hardiness zone 7 and above. It requires good soil, regular watering and feeding, and frost protection in winter. Rooted suckers can be planted each year, so mature specimens can be disposed of after a few years, as each individual plant lives only a few years. The peak season for artichoke harvesting is the spring, but they can continue to be harvested throughout the summer, with another peak period in mid-autumn. When harvested, they are cut from the plant so as to leave an inch or two of stem. Artichokes possess good keeping qualities, frequently remaining quite fresh for two weeks or longer under average retail conditions.

Apart from culinary applications, the globe artichoke is also an attractive plant for its bright floral display, sometimes grown in herbaceous borders for its bold foliage and large, purple flower heads.

==Uses==
===Nutrition===
Cooked unsalted artichoke is 82% water, 12% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 3% fat. In a 100-gram reference serving, cooked artichoke supplies 74 calories, is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate, and is a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin K (16% DV), magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus (10–12% DV).

===Culinary===
Large globe artichokes are frequently prepared by removing all but or so of the stem. To remove thorns, which may interfere with eating, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is simmered for 15 to 30 minutes, or steamed for 30–40 minutes (less for small ones). A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavor.

Salt may be added to the water if boiling artichokes. Covered artichokes, in particular those that have been cut, can turn brown due to the enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation. Placing them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice can prevent the discoloration.

Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten, with vinaigrette, hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon juice, or other sauces. The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

In Italy, artichoke hearts in oil are the usual vegetable for the &quot;spring&quot; section of the &quot;four seasons&quot; pizza (alongside tomatoes and basil for summer, mushrooms for autumn, and prosciutto and olives for winter). 

A recipe well known in Rome is Jewish-style artichokes, which are deep-fried whole. The softer parts of artichokes are also eaten raw, one leaf at a time dipped in vinegar and olive oil, or thinly sliced and dressed with lemon and olive oil.

There are many stuffed artichoke recipes. A common Italian stuffing uses a mixture of bread crumbs, garlic, oregano, parsley, grated cheese, and prosciutto or sausage. A bit of the mixture is then pushed into the spaces at the base of each leaf and into the center before boiling or steaming.

In Spain, younger, smaller, and more tender artichokes are used. They can be sprinkled with olive oil and left in hot ashes in a barbecue, sautéed in olive oil with garlic, with rice as a paella, or sautéed and combined with eggs in a tortilla (frittata).

Often cited is the Greek &quot;anginares alla Polita&quot; (&quot;artichokes city-style&quot;, referring to the city of Constantinople), a hearty, savory stew made with artichoke hearts, potatoes, and carrots, and flavored with onion, lemon, and dill. The island of Tinos, or the villages of Iria and Kantia in the Peloponnese, still very much celebrate their local production, including with a &quot;day of the artichoke&quot; or an artichoke festival.

Artichokes may also be prepared by completely breaking off all of the leaves, leaving the bare heart. The leaves are steamed to soften the fleshy base part of each leaf to be used as the basis for any number of side dishes or appetizing dips, or the fleshy part is left attached to the heart, while the upper parts of the leaves are discarded. The remaining concave-shaped heart is often filled with meat, then fried or baked in a savory sauce. Canned or frozen artichoke hearts are a time-saving substitute, though the consistency and stronger flavor of fresh hearts, when available, is often preferred. Deep-fried artichoke hearts are eaten in coastal areas of California.

Throughout North Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and Armenia, ground lamb is a favorite filling for stuffed artichoke hearts. Spices reflect the local cuisine of each country. In Lebanon, for example, the typical filling would include lamb, onion, tomato, pinenuts, raisins, parsley, dill, mint, black pepper, and allspice. A popular Turkish vegetarian variety uses only onion, carrot, green peas, and salt. Artichokes are often prepared with white sauces or other kinds of sauces.

====Herbal tea====
Artichokes can also be made into a herbal tea. The infusion is consumed particularly among the Vietnamese. An artichoke-based herbal tea called &quot;Ceai de Anghinare&quot; is made in Romania. The flower portion is put into water and consumed as a herbal tea in Mexico. It has a slightly bitter, woody taste.

====Apéritif====
Artichoke is the primary botanical ingredient of the Italian aperitif Cynar, with 16.5% alcohol by volume, produced by the Campari Group. It can be served over ice as an aperitif or as a cocktail mixed with orange juice, which is especially popular in Switzerland. It is also used to make a &#x27;Cin Cyn&#x27;, a slightly less-bitter version of the Negroni cocktail, by substituting Cynar for Campari.

==Genome ==
The globe artichoke genome has been sequenced. The genome assembly covers 725 of the 1,084 Mb genome and the sequence codes for about 27,000 genes. An understanding of the genome structure is an important step in understanding traits of the globe artichoke, which may aid in the identification of economically important genes from related species.

<doc id="1120743" wikidata="Q4838841" url="?curid=1120743" title="Bachelorette">
<text>Bachelorette (/ˌbætʃələˈrɛt/) is a term used in American English for a single, unmarried woman. The term is derived from the word &quot;bachelor&quot;, and is often used by journalists, editors of popular magazines, and some individuals. &quot;Bachelorette&quot; was famously the term used to refer to female contestants on the old &quot;The Dating Game&quot; TV show and, more recently, &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;.

In older English, the female counterpart term to &quot;bachelor&quot; was &quot;spinster&quot;. However, this has acquired negative connotations and, when used now, tends to imply that the unmarried woman is too old to find a husband and have children. A bachelorette may have previously been in a relationship.

In Canada, the term &quot;bachelorette&quot; also refers to a small bachelor apartment (an apartment with only one large room serving as a bedroom and living room plus a separate bathroom—i.e. a studio apartment).

==Derivation==
The more proper neologism would be &quot;bacheloress&quot;, since the &quot;&quot; suffix is the standard English suffix denoting a female subject, while &quot;&quot; is a French-origin diminutive suffix, mainly used to denote something is smaller in size. However, in American English the &quot;-ess&quot; suffix is only marginally morphologically productive, and the &quot;-ette&quot; suffix can indicate a feminine version of a noun without a change in size (though many such words in &quot;-ette&quot; were intended to be jocular when they were first coined). The &quot;-ess&quot; suffix is also slowly falling into disuse in the English language due to attempts to neutralize professional terms; it is therefore less commonly applied to new terms nowadays.

==Reasons for use==

An archaic English term for a woman who has never married is a spinster, while a woman who is divorced is a divorcée, and a woman whose spouse has died is a widow. &quot;Spinster&quot; often implied that the woman was older than the age when most women traditionally marry and that she would probably never marry; a more derogatory term was &quot;old maid&quot;.

Typically, a young person (male or female) who has never been married is said to be &quot;single&quot; or &quot;never married&quot;.

The term &quot;bachelorette&quot; may indicate a woman who is unmarried by choice, the counterpart to the term &quot;bachelor&quot;.

== Word origin and history ==
1935, American English, from bachelor with French ending -ette. Replaced earlier bachelor- girl (1895) . Middle French had bachelette &quot;young girl; &quot;Modern French bachelière is found only in the &quot;student&quot; sense.

<text>Richard Fleming ( 1385 – 25 or 26 January 1431), Bishop of Lincoln and founder of Lincoln College, Oxford, was born at Crofton in Yorkshire.

==Biography==
Fleming was descended from a gentry family. His aunt, Cecily Fleming had married Robert Waterton, &#x27;Henry IV&#x27;s esquire and right-hand man&#x27;. His nephew, Robert Flemming, was likely an illegitimate son of Robert Flemming, esquire, of Wath, near Ripon (d.1459).

Fleming was educated at University College, Oxford. Having taken his degrees, he was made prebendary of York in 1406, and the next year was junior proctor of the university. In 1409 he was appointed to the committee of twelve censors who were commissioned to examine the writings of John Wyclif and determine the heretical ideas they contained. Later that year he was accused of supporting some of Wyclif&#x27;s errors in a public disputation, for which he incurred the censure of Archbishop Arundel. Fleming must have either been exonerated or renounced his supposed heresy because he was still a member of the committee of censors when its list of Wycliffe&#x27;s errors was published in 1411 (Nighman, 2003, pp. 208–10).

Before 1415 Fleming was instituted to the rectory of Boston in Lincolnshire. He attended the Council of Constance from late 1416 to early 1418 where he delivered a number of sermons which survive, all of which reveal a strong concern for clerical reform (Nighman, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2008a, 2008b). He was nominated to the see of Lincoln by papal provision on 20 November 1419 and on 28 April 1420 he was consecrated as bishop of Lincoln by Martin V in Florence. He attended the Council of Pavia and Siena in 1428–1429 and, in the presence of the pope, reportedly made an eloquent speech in vindication of the rights of the English &quot;nation&quot; and in support of papal authority against the more radical proponents of conciliarism; this sermon apparently does not survive. It was probably on this occasion that he was named chamberlain to the pope.

In February 1424 the see of York being vacant, the pope conferred it on Fleming; but the regency council of the young king Henry VI refused to confirm the appointment, and Fleming resigned the appointment in July 1425. In 1427, Fleming obtained a royal licence empowering him to found a college at Oxford for the special purpose of training theologians to combat Wyclif&#x27;s heresy. To Bishop Fleming was entrusted the execution of the decree of the Council of Constance for the exhumation and burning of Wycliffe&#x27;s remains, though Fleming delayed fulfilling this duty for over a decade. He died at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, in January 1431. Although his foundation of Lincoln College, Oxford, was incomplete at the time of his death, the college&#x27;s future was eventually secured and Fleming&#x27;s manuscript books became the core collection of the collegiate library (de la Mare, 1962–3).

<doc id="1120754" wikidata="Q659457" url="?curid=1120754" title="Banu Qasi">
<text>The Banu Qasi, Banu Kasi, Beni Casi (, meaning &quot;sons&quot; or &quot;heirs of Cassius&quot;), Banu Musa, or al-Qasawi were a Muladí (local convert) dynasty that in the 9th century ruled the Upper March, a frontier territory of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba, located on the upper Ebro Valley. At their height in the 850s, family head Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi was so powerful and autonomous that he would be called &#x27;The Third Monarch of Hispania&#x27;. In the first half of the 10th century, an intra-family succession squabble, rebellions and rivalries with competing families, in the face of vigorous monarchs to the north and south, led to the sequential loss of all of their land.

==Dynastic beginnings==
The family is said to descend from the Hispano-Roman
nobleman named Cassius. Muslim chronicles and the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot; suggest he was a Visigoth. According to the 10th century Muwallad historian, Ibn al-Qūṭiyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714 as the &quot;mawlā&quot; (client) of the Umayyads, shortly after their conquest of Hispania. After his conversion, he is said to have traveled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Umayyad Caliph, Al-Walid I.

Under the Banu Qasi, the region of Upper Ebro (modern districts of Logroño and southern Navarre, based in Tudela) formed a semi-autonomous principality. The tiny emirate was faced by enemies in several directions. Although never realized, the threat of Frankish attempts to regain control over the western Pyrenees was a real one. In actuality, even more menacing was the gradual eastwards expansion of the Asturian Kingdom; while in the south lay the Caliphate of Córdoba, ever anxious to impose its authority over the frontier regions.

As a local Muslim dynasty in the Ebro valley (the Upper March of Al-Andalus; , &quot;Aṯ-Ṯaḡr al-Aʿlà&quot;), the Banu Qasi were nominally clients of the emirate, but they thrived on regional rivalries and alliances with other Muwallad dynasties of the Upper March, the Vascon tribal chieftains of Pamplona and Aragon, as well as with the Catalan counts of Pallars-Ribagorza to the north and Barcelona to the east, the Kingdom of Asturias to the west and the Umayyads to the south over the next two centuries. They frequently intermarried with other regional nobility, both Muslim and Christian. Musa ibn Musa and the Pamplona king Íñigo Arista were maternal half-brothers, while Musa also married Arista&#x27;s daughter, and his own daughter and nieces were married to other Pyrenean princes. The cultural ambivalence of the Banu Qasi is also demonstrated by their mixed use of names: for example, Arabic (&quot;Muhammad&quot;, &quot;Musa&quot;, &quot;Abd Allah&quot;), Latinate (&quot;Awriya&quot;, &quot;Furtun&quot;, &quot;Lubb&quot;), and Basque (&quot;Garshiya&quot;).

The Umayyads of Cordova sanctioned the rule of the Banu Qasi and repeatedly granted them autonomy by appointing them as governors, only to replace them as they expressed too much independence, or launch punitive military expeditions into the region. Such acts on the part of the Umayyads demonstrated their failure to ever fully resolve the problem of effective, central control of outlying regions.

==First rise to prominence==
The speculated homeland of Count Cassius was a narrow strip across the Ebro from Tudela. The Arab historian Ibn Hazm listed the sons of Count Cassius as &quot;Furtun&quot;, &quot;Abu Tawr&quot;, &quot;Abu Salama&quot;, &quot;Yunus&quot; and &quot;Yahya&quot;. Of these, it has been suggested that the second may be the Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca, who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778. Likewise, the Banu Salama, removed from power in Huesca and Barbitanya (the area of Barbastro) at the end of the 8th century, may have derived from Abu Salama. Subsequent leaders of the family descend from the eldest son, Furtun. His son, Musa ibn Furtun ibn Qasi, first garnered notice in 788, when on behalf of emir Hisham I of Córdoba he put down the rebellion of the Banu Husain in Zaragoza. The fate of Musa ibn Furtun is debated. An account of the 788 rebellion tells of Musa&#x27;s murder shortly thereafter at the hands of a Banu Husain follower, yet a &quot;Furtun ibn Musa&quot; is said to have been killed in his own 802 Zaragoza uprising, and it has been suggested that this name may be an error for Musa ibn Furtun. However, Ibn Hayyan also reports a Furtun &#x27;the Lame&#x27; al-Qasawi (of the Banu Qasi) forming a coalition with Pamplona, Álava, Castile, Amaya and Cerdanya to fight against Amrus ibn Yusuf at this time, suggesting that this is instead a son of Musa ibn Furtun overlooked by Ibn Hazm, whose genealogy provides most of what we know about the clan.

In the next generation, Mutarrif ibn Musa, was likely a son of Musa ibn Furtun, although historian Ibn Hayyan only mentions his name and does not say that he was a member of the Banu Qasi clan. According to Ibn Hayyan, &quot;in (183 H: 799-800) the people of Pamplona deceived Mutarrif ibn Musa and killed him&quot;. &quot;This is perhaps one of the most quoted paragraphs by historians who on the basis of this brief news, have woven a complex web of relationships involving the Banu Qasi, the Arista and the Carolingians&quot;. Évariste Lévi-Provençal was the first to say that &quot;Pamplona, the capital of Vasconia, had not been governed by the Muslims since 798 (...) and that its inhabitants had killed the representative of the Umayyad authorities, Mutarrif ben Musa Ben Qasi, and had chosen one of their own, named Velasco.&quot; This Velasco would be the same &quot;enemy of God, Balashk al-Yalashqi, Lord of Pamplona&quot;, a pro-Carolingian against whom the Muslims launched a military campaign in 816. Spanish historian Claudio Sánchez Albornoz did not agree with this interpretation and believed that it had been the people of Pamplona, without any outside intervention, who took matters in their own hands. Nowhere does Ibn Hayyan mention that Mutarrif ibn Musa was the governor of Pamplona or that Velasco was pro-Carolingian.

It was Musa&#x27;s son Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi whose rule brought the family to the peak of its power.






==Musa ibn Musa==
Besides the Arab sources, Musa ibn Musa is mentioned in three Latin texts: the &quot;Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis&quot;; the &quot;Albendensis&quot;; and the &quot;Códice de Roda&quot;. The latter mentions his family relations as the half-brother and son-in-law of King Íñigo Arista and the properties he held. The &quot;Albeldensis&quot; describes the Battle of Monte Laturce, also referred to as the second Battle of Albelda, whereas the Chronicle of Alfonso III provides a more detailed account of his life and feats.

While Musa had been orphaned at an early age, his military activity may have begun in the 820s, and the Banu Qasi (possibly Musa himself) most probably participated in the second battle of the pass of Roncevaux along with their relatives of Pamplona, an event leading to the establishment of the kingdom of Pamplona. Historians agree that in the 840s, after the expulsion from his lands of a kinsman, &#x27;Abd al-Jabbar al-Qasawi, Musa launched a series of revolts in conjunction with his maternal half-brother, Íñigo Arista of Pamplona. Abd ar-Rahman II defeated them, and took Musa&#x27;s son Lubb hostage. Musa repeatedly submitted, only to rise again. After repeated rebellions he controlled a region along the Ebro from Borja to Logroño, including Tudela, Tarazona, Arnedo and Calahorra. The 851/2 deaths of Íñigo Arista and Abd ar-Rahman II, as well as a victory over Christian forces at Albelda, gave Musa unprecedented status. The new emir, Muhammad I of Córdoba named Musa the Wali of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March. Over the next decade Musa expanded the family&#x27;s lands to include Zaragoza, Najera, Viguera and Calatayud, while also governing Tudela, Huesca and Toledo, and according to the &quot;Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis&quot;, Musa had his followers call him &quot;the third king of &quot;Spaniae&quot;&quot;.

Throughout this period, as reported by Ibn Hazm, Musa was also involved in a struggle within his family. Musa&#x27;s brother Yunus ibn Musa is said to have remained loyal to Córdoba, and joined with the sons of their uncle Zahir ibn Furtun to fight Musa over a period of about 30 years. Ibn Hazm reports that Yunus had descendants, but provides no further details.

In 859, Ordoño I of Asturias and García Íñiguez of Pamplona joined forces to deal Musa a crushing defeat at Albelda, which passed into Christian legend as the Battle of Clavijo. Emir Muhammad then stripped Musa of his titles and restored direct Cordoban control over the region. Musa died in 862 of wounds received in a petty squabble with a son-in-law, and the family disappeared from the political scene for a decade.

==Sons of Musa==
Following the 862 death of Musa, nothing is known of the family until 871. It is presumed that the members of the family associated with the Cordoban court and military campaigns, but no record of their presence there survives. According to the &quot;Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis&quot;, upon learning of his father&#x27;s defeat at Albelda, his son Lubb ibn Musa ibn with all his men, submitted themselves to the rule of the Asturian king Ordoño and became his lifelong subjects. By the time the Banu Qasi reappear, they had lost control of most of their lands, being left with just a small area surrounding Arnedo. In 870, a rebellion in Huesca initiated a chain of events that would bring the Banu Qasi back to dominance. In that year, Amrus ibn Umar of the Banu Amrus assassinated the &quot;amil&quot; Musa ibn Galind, thought to have been son of the Córdoba-resident brother of Pamplona king García Íñiguez. The &quot;Amir&quot;, Muhammad, sent an army to the north, but Amrus allied himself with García, and the Cordoban general, Abd al-Gafir ibn Abd al-Aziz, was killed before the gates of Zaragoza. The Banu Qasi sons of Musa, apparently under the leadership of eldest son Lubb ibn Musa, then allied themselves with García, and reestablished control over their father&#x27;s possessions. First, the residents of Huesca called on Mutarrif ibn Musa al-Qasawi for leadership. In January 872, Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa entered Zaragoza, and was there joined by Lubb, the two of them together taking Monzon. Isma&#x27;il also allied himself with the Banu Jalaf of Barbitanya, marrying Sayyida, daughter of Abd Allah ibn Jalaf. Furtun ibn Musa occupied Tudela, whose governor the Banu Qasi imprisoned at Arnedo, then killed following an escape. Lubb also occupied and refortified Viguera.

The immediate response of emir Muhammad was to try to limit the expansion of the Banu Qasi by installing a rival dynasty, the Arab Banu Tujib, in Calatayud, the one part of their father&#x27;s possessions not reclaimed. In the next year, 873, Muhammad launched a campaign against the various northern rebels. He first bought off the rebels of Toledo with governorships, and this encouraged Amrus to offer his loyalty, for which he was rewarded with Huesca where he captured Mutarrif and his family, including wife Belasquita, the daughter of García Íñiguez of Pamplona. In spite of a desperate attack by the combined troops of his brothers, Mutarrif and three sons, Muhammad, Musa and Lubb, were taken to Córdoba and crucified. The next year, Furtun died in Tudela, while Lubb was killed in an accident in Viguera in 875. This left control of the family in the hands of two men, the remaining brother Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa in Monzon, and Lubb&#x27;s son, Muhammad ibn Lubb al-Qasawi, who is first known as a defender of Zaragoza against the emirate troops.

==Muhammad ibn Lubb==

Over the next decade, following the deaths of his father and two uncles, Muhammad ibn Lubb maneuvered to become the leader of the family. He resisted 879 and 882 campaigns from Córdoba. The latter was under the general Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz, and Muhammad tried to persuade Hashim to unite with him against the Asturians, now ruled by Alfonso III. The earlier hostage-taking done by all parties, greatly complicated such situation. Hashim did not want to antagonize Alfonso, who was holding his son as a hostage. Hashim himself held a son of Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa, and he sent his captive and other gifts to Alfonso in return for his son. Muhammad would later ally himself with the kings of Pamplona and Asturias, and it was apparently he who raised the future Ordoño II of León at his court. The struggle for power within the Banu Qasi family came to a head in 882, when Muhammad fought, near Calahorra, a 7000-man force of his uncle Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa, and Isma&#x27;il ibn Furtun, a son of his uncle Furtun. In the following internecine squabbles, Furtun&#x27;s four sons were killed and Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa was forced to retreat to Monzon. From there he rebuilt Lleida and routed an army sent by Wilfred of Barcelona. Muhammad ibn Lubb, now the clear head of the family, was left in control of the majority of the Banu Qasi lands. In 884, the emir sent two military campaigns into the region and took Zaragoza, although chronicler Ibn Hayyan reports that Muhammad ibn Lubb had sold the city to count Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza prior to its fall. This resulted in a consolidated Banu Qasi powerbase around Arnedo, Borja, Calahorra and Viguera, with Isma&#x27;il holding an enclave to the east, around Monzon and Lleida.

In 885 and 886, Muhammad launched attacks against Castile, in the first apparently killing count Diego Rodríguez Porcelos, while the second was an attack on Álava in which many Christians were killed. The latter year also saw the death of emir Muhammad I of Córdoba. Muhammad ibn Lubb tested his power against the new emirs, and they responded by again trying to balance Banu Qasi power in the region, giving Zaragoza to the rival Tujibids, and Huesca to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil of the Muwallad Banu Shabrit clan. The latter was shortly challenged by Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa, whose sons fought a battle against al-Tawil&#x27;s troops, Musa ibn Isma&#x27;il being killed and his brother Mutarrif captured. Isma&#x27;il died shortly thereafter, in 889, and al-Tawil and Muhammad ibn Lubb each took their case to emir Abd Allah for possession of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s lands, the emir confirming the succession of Muhammad ibn Lubb. There followed a period of relative peace and collaboration between Muhammad ibn Lubb and al-Tawil. In 891, Muhammad defeated a Christian force at Castro Sibiriano, but he dedicated most of his efforts in his final years against Tujibid Zaragoza, initiating what would become a 17-year siege. In 897, the citizens of Toledo rose up and offered their city to Muhammad, but being occupied with Zaragoza, he sent his son Lubb. Muhammad was reconnoitering Zaragoza in 898, when on 8 October, he was caught by a guard who spitted him on a lance. His head was presented to the Tujibids, who sent it to Córdoba, where it was displayed in front of the palace for eight days before being buried with the honors due a brave foe.

==Lubb ibn Muhammad==

Muhammad&#x27;s son, Lubb ibn Muhammad al-Qasawi, was born in 870, and was already active at the time of his father&#x27;s death. In 896, he was refortifying Monzon when al-Tawil of Huesca tried his luck. Though being attacked by a larger, better equipped army, Lubb was able to rout al-Tawil&#x27;s men, taking his brother prisoner. In January 897 he went to Toledo to take up the leadership offer the citizens had made his father. Back in the east, he launched an attack on Aura that led to the death of Wilfred of Barcelona. Returning through Toledo in 898, he next marched to Jaén, with the intent of forming a coalition with another rebel, Umar ibn Hafsun, but before Umar reached Jaén, the news of his father&#x27;s death at Zaragoza forced Lubb&#x27;s return to Tudela, where he formally recognized the sovereignty of the emir, Abd Allah, in exchange for the formal governorship over Tudela and Tarazona. His return north found al-Tawil moving to take advantage of the temporary power vacuum and three weeks after his father&#x27;s death, Lubb captured the Huesca ruler in a skirmish. To buy his freedom, al-Tawil ceded lands between Huesca and Monzon to Lubb, and agreed to pay 100,000 gold dinares for the possession of Huesca. Paying 50,000 immediately, he gave his son Abd al-Malik and daughter Sayyida as hostages to ensure payment of the second half. Lubb would relent, forgiving the remaining debt and returning the hostages except Sayyida, whom he married.

Lubb ibn Muhammad continued his father&#x27;s siege of Zaragoza, but found himself drawn in other directions. Perhaps in 900, Alfonso III, in conjunction with Fortún Garcés of Pamplona, launched a raid against Tarazona, in Lubb&#x27;s realms; which he successfully blocked. Then in 903, Toledo again rebelled against Cordova, asking Lubb to take control. He sent his brother Mutarrif, who was proclaimed their &quot;Amir&quot;. Mutarrif&#x27;s fate is unknown, but by 906, he had been replaced by Lubb&#x27;s kinsman, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, son of Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa, who was then assassinated. Alfonso again attacked Lubb&#x27;s lands, laying siege to Grañón, but was forced to lift the siege when Lubb moved with an army toward Alava. This threat neutralized, Lubb turned toward Pallars, ravaging the lands, killing hundreds and taking a thousand captives, including Isarn, Count Raymond&#x27;s son, who was kept in Tudela for a decade before being freed.

In 905, a coalition of the King of Asturias, the counts of Aragon and Pallars, and, it is sometimes claimed, Lubb ibn Muhammad, engineered a coup in Navarre that brought Sancho Garcés to the throne in place of Fortún Garcés. Two years later, Lubb launched an attack on Pamplona and fought at &quot;Liédena&quot; on 30 September 907, resulting in a total rout of the Banu Qasi forces, while Lubb was killed. The transcendent battle marked a permanent change in the regional balance, Sancho&#x27;s Pamplona becoming a major regional power, while it initiated the final decline of the Banu Qasi.

==Decline (905-929)==
With the fall of Lubb, his local rivals immediately fell upon the Banu Qasi lands. Sancho descended toward Calahorra. The Tujibids finally broke the siege of Zaragoza and captured Ejea. Al-Tawil retook the lands he had lost, and proceeded to overrun the family&#x27;s eastern enclave, taking Barbastro and Lleida. Monzon was briefly controlled by Lubb&#x27;s brother Yunus ibn Muhammad, but he could not hold it, and Monzon too fell to the al-Tawil. In the reduced western lands, Lubb was succeeded by brother Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Qasawi. In 911, Abd Allah and al-Tawil jointly, along with al-Tawil&#x27;s brother-in-law Galindo Aznárez II of Aragon, attacked Pamplona. After destroying several castles, they developed cold feet and withdrew, but were caught by Sancho. Al-Tawil defected and escaped, while Galindo was crushed and forced to recognize Sancho as feudal sovereign, ending the autonomy of the Aragon. Arab sources describe Abd Allah&#x27;s rear-guard action at Luesia as a victory, but if so it was only a tactical victory and he immediately retreated south. In 914, Sancho turned the tables, marching into the heart of the Banu Qasi homeland, taking Arnedo and attacking Calahorra. In the next year, 915, Sancho turned toward Tudela, and there captured Abd Allah, killing a thousand of his best men. Mutarrif ibn Muhammad al-Qasawi, Abd Allah&#x27;s brother, rushed to relieve the city, and Abd Allah was ransomed, his daughter Urraca and probably son Furtun ibn Abd Allah being given as hostages. However, two months later Abd Allah was assassinated, it is said, through the machinations of Sancho.

The only bright spot for the family in this period happened in the east. In 913, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil died, and the next year, the residents of Monzon rejected his son Amrus ibn Muhammad, and invited the Banu Qasi to return in the person of Muhammad ibn Lubb, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad. After a brief siege, he was able to reclaim the city for his family, as well as Lleida.

In the west, Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and his nephew Muhammad ibn Abd Allah struggled for dominance. The latter proved victorious, killing Mutarrif in 916. Since the death of Lubb in 907, the Banu Qasi had been left fractured and weakened in the face of two resurgent powers: to the north and west, a collaboration between the new king of León, Ordoño II, and Sancho I of Navarre brought a strong army south, ravaging the Banu Qasi lands around Viguera, Najera and Tudela in 918, while the young and energetic Abd ar-Rahman III, who was to temporarily reverse the centrifugal forces at work in the Emirate, soon to be Caliphate of Córdoba, sent armies north, routing the Christians. The next year, both Banu Qasi leaders, Muhammad ibn Abd Allah and Muhammad ibn Lubb, attacked the Banu al-Tawil at Barbastro, but Sancho took advantage of this, and allying himself with his cousin Bernard I of Ribagorza and the Banu al-Tawil, he attacked and burned Monzon, which was hence lost to the Banu Qasi. 

In 920, the emir, Abd ar-Rahman III, personally led the Cordoban army north, and forced Sancho to abandon fortifications he had been building. After some maneuvering the emir met the armies of Ordoño and Sancho, and defeated them at Valdejunquera. In 923, the Christian allies brought another force south, and while Muhammad ibn Abd Allah formed a coalition of local nobles to resist it, their armies were dispersed and Viguera and Najera fell. Like his father, Muhammad was captured, then assassinated on Sancho&#x27;s orders, and when Abd ar-Rahman launched another punitive campaign the next year, on his return to Tudela he removed the Banu Qasi and sent them to Córdoba, placing their old rivals the Tujibids of Zaragoza in their place.
After 923, only the eastern enclave encompassing Lleida and the &quot;husûn&quot; of Balaguer, Barbastro and Ayera were in the hands of the family. However, one by one these expelled Muhammad ibn Lubb and turned to the Tujibids for leadership, leaving him only Ayera in 928, when Jimeno Garcés, the new king of Navarre, intervened on his behalf in opposition to Hasim ibn Muhammad al-Tujibi. The next year, Muhammad fell victim to an ambush and was killed by his brother-in-law, a son of Raymond of Pallars.





==Legacy==
The death of Muhammad ibn Lubb marked the end of the Banu Qasi in the Ebro valley. Their rivals the Tujibids would follow their model, making an independent peace with Leon in 937, a move that resulted in a punitive expedition from the Caliph similar to those of prior years against the Banu Qasi. The Tujibids would eventually establish a full-fledged Taifa kingdom centered at Zaragoza.

Two other Taifa crowns were ruled by men with names reminiscent of the Banu Qasi and are claimed as dynastic members, although there is no evidence of any actual genealogical connection. A small Taifa state at Alpuente was founded by Abd Allah ibn Qasim. He was of a convert family that claimed a tribal affiliation with the Yamanī/Fíhrī. In 1144, another Christian convert and Sufi mystic from Silves, Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, called Ibn Qasi, rose and established a Taifa state at Mértola, expanding it to much of southern Portugal, and he encouraged the successful move of the Almohads (to whom he would submit) against Seville. They fell out and Ibn Qasi was assassinated in 1151 by his own men.;

==Leadership of the Banu Qasi==
The following men are the documented leaders of the Banu Qasi (entries in &quot;italics&quot; are of uncertain affiliation to the family):
* Cassius, fl. 714
** &quot;Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca, fl. 778, perhaps son of Cassius&quot;
* Musa ibn Furtun, grandson of Cassius
** &quot;Mutarrif ibn Musa, assassinated 799, perhaps son of Musa ibn Furtun&quot;
** &quot;Furtun ibn Musa, killed in rebellion 801, perhaps son of Musa ibn Furtun, else identical to him&quot;
* Musa ibn Musa, d. 862, son of Musa ibn Furtun
* Lubb ibn Musa, d. 875, son of Musa ibn Musa
* Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa, co-leader to 882, d. 889, son of Musa ibn Musa
* Muhammad ibn Lubb, co-leader to 882, then sole leader, d. 899, son of Lubb ibn Musa
* Lubb ibn Muhammad, d. 907, son of Muhammad ibn Lubb
* Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, d. 915, son of Muhammad ibn Lubb
:(succession struggle between Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, 915-916)
* Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, d. 923, son of Abd Allah ibn Muhammad
* Muhammad ibn Lubb, d. 929, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad
:(end of dynasty)

The Inde () is a small river in Belgium and in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
==Geography==

The Inde is a left (western) tributary of the Rur/Roer, in eastern Belgium and in North Rhine-Westphalia, western Germany.

Its source is near Raeren, in Eastern Belgium. The Inde runs through Aachen-Kornelimünster, Eschweiler, and Inden. Its mouth is on the Rur near Jülich. Because of lignite opencast mining, a section of the course was diverted near Inden-Lamersdorf in 2003 .

Tributaries of the Inde include the streams: Omerbach, Otterbach, Saubach, Vichtbach, and Wehebach.

==History==
Its name is of Celtic origin: &quot;Inda&quot;. The Inde has a counterpart, a &quot;small Inde&quot;, in France: the Andelle, which is a long river in the French département Seine-Maritime and whose original name was Indella. 
The suffix -ella is an example for Celtic river names comparing for instance Mosella (= Moselle, i.e. &quot;small Mosa (= Maas)&quot;). For the name &quot;Inde&quot;, the Indoeuropean stem *wed (= water) is supposed, like in words like Italian &quot;onda&quot; and French &quot;onde&quot; (= wave). 

The Inde acquired historical importance when Emperor Louis the Pious founded the Kornelimünster Abbey monastery along one of its old courses in 815.

<doc id="1120759" wikidata="Q284900" url="?curid=1120759" title="Ab ovo">
<text>Ab ovo is Latin for &quot;from the beginning, the origin, the egg&quot;. The term is a reference to one of the twin eggs from which Helen of Troy was born. The eggs were laid by Leda after Zeus, disguised as a swan, either seduced and mated with or raped her, according to different versions. Had Leda not laid the egg, Helen would not have been born, so Paris could not have eloped with her, so there would have been no Trojan War.

== In literature ==

The English literary use of the phrase comes from Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who &quot;does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg&quot; (), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (&quot;in medias res&quot;). This advice is famously rejected in Laurence Sterne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;.

This use is distinct from the longer phrase &quot;ab ovo usque ad mala&quot; (lit. &quot;from the egg to the apples&quot;) which appears in Horace&#x27;s &quot;Satire&quot; 1.3. It refers to the course of a Roman meal, which often began with eggs and ended with fruit, and is similar to the American English phrase &quot;&quot;. Thus &quot;ab ovo&quot; can also be used to mean a complete or entire thing.

<text>Pastor Fletcher A. Brothers is a fundamentalist preacher and author from Carthage, New York.

==Freedom Village==
Brothers is best known as the founder of Freedom Village USA, a home for troubled teens operated from a Christian Fundamentalist perspective and founded in Lakemont, New York in 1981. The campus was the site of the Lakemont Academy, a secular boys boarding school. Freedom Village also operated an office in Burlington, Ontario and it had many students from Canada.

Freedom Village came under fire when it was revealed to be paying workers less than minimum wage, and for the punishment practiced on students, and for allegedly abusing child labor laws

Brothers had to sell the Lakemont property to cover his millions of dollars in debt after he was denied the ability to file for bankruptcy.

The podcast We Warned Them: Freedom Village investigated the legacy of Freedom Village and the life of Fletcher Brothers, revealing their larger connections to the &#x27;troubled teen&#x27; industry.

<doc id="1120771" wikidata="Q12001701" url="?curid=1120771" title="Society of Genealogists">
<text>The Society of Genealogists (SoG) is a UK-based educational charity, founded in 1911 to &quot;promote, encourage and foster the study, science and knowledge of genealogy&quot;. The Society&#x27;s Library is the largest specialist genealogical library outside North America. Membership is open to any adult who agrees to abide by the Society&#x27;s rules and who pays the annual subscription. At the end of 2023, it had 6,654 members.

==History==
Until it purchased 37 Harrington Gardens, South Kensington, in 1954, the Society was based in Malet Place, Bloomsbury, London. The constant growth of the library and increasingly cramped building forced the Society to also sell this headquarters and move both to 14 Charterhouse Buildings (constructed in 1968 for storing rolls of silk), in Clerkenwell, London, in July 1984.

After Charterhouse Buildings was sold in 2020, in December 2023, after a period in temporary accommodation, the Society opened new premises in Islington, just off the City Road.

==Facilities==
The Society possesses the largest family history research library in the United Kingdom, accessible to all members without charge and available to be used by the general public on payment of a fee. Society holdings include thousands of parish register and nonconformist register copies on microfilm or microfiche or in manuscript, typescript or published form, along with tombstone inscriptions, will, marriage licence and census transcripts and indexes, trade and residential directories and poll books (lists of voters), family histories, biographical dictionaries, works on apprentices and occupations, the armed forces, school and university registers and histories, genealogical journals and many other related works. The library catalogue is available on the Society&#x27;s web site.

In 2000, the Society made a number of its genealogical datasets available online on the commercial service British Origins, with some free access for Society members. This material is now hosted commercially by Findmypast with a separate free service to members run by the Society itself on its own web site using the Frontis Archive Publishing System.

==Activities==
The emphasis is on British, British Empire and Commonwealth sources, but the Society has some sources for most parts of the world.

The Society&#x27;s Internet suite offers free access to major genealogical websites including Ancestry and Findmypast.

The society runs a programme of lectures, visits, and courses every year, and publishes textbooks, indexes, and a quarterly journal, &quot;Genealogists&#x27; Magazine&quot;. The latter is currently edited by Michael Gandy.

==Prince Michael of Kent Award==
The society&#x27;s patron is Prince Michael of Kent, after whom the Society has named a prestigious award (created in 2000), granted periodically to a person or organisation which has made an outstanding contribution to genealogy.

===Recipients===
Years not listed means no one was awarded.

<doc id="1120774" wikidata="Q1024639" url="?curid=1120774" title="C+C Music Factory">
<text>C+C Music Factory was an American musical group formed in 1989 by David Cole and Robert Clivillés. The group is best known for their five hit singles: &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot;, &quot;Here We Go (Let&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll)&quot;, &quot;Things That Make You Go Hmmm...&quot;, &quot;Just a Touch of Love&quot;, and &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27;&quot;. The band stopped recording in 1996, following Cole&#x27;s death. In 2010, C+C Music Factory reformed with Eric Kupper replacing Cole. Original member Freedom Williams acquired trademark rights to the name in 2003 and still tours under that moniker.

C+C Music Factory have earned 35 music industry awards, including five &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, five American Music Awards, and two MTV Video Music Awards. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; named them the 44th-most successful dance act.

==History==
===1987–1989: Early beginnings and the 28th Street Crew===
David Cole and Robert Clivillés became friends when they both performed at the Better Days club (Clivillés as DJ and Cole as keyboardist) in the late 1980s. In 1987, Clivillés and Cole formed a short-lived house music group called 2 Puerto Ricans, a Blackman and a Dominican. The group also included David Morales (who, like Clivillés, was a resident DJ at Better Days) and Chep Nuñez. They released two minor hit singles, &quot;Do It Properly&quot; (1987) and &quot;So Many Ways (Do It Properly Part II)&quot; (1988). In 1989, they released their final single, &quot;Scandalous&quot;, before disbanding.

Following the breakup of their previous group, Clivillés and Cole continued to record music together under the name the 28th Street Crew. In mid-1989, the duo released an album titled &quot;I Need a Rhythm&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track and lead single, peaked at number three on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance chart. In September 1989, female group Seduction released their debut album &quot;Nothing Matters Without Love&quot;, which was entirely produced by Clivillés and Cole. Under the brief management of Clivillés and Cole, the group&#x27;s album became certified gold-status in the United States.

===1989–1992: C+C Music Factory and &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot;===
In 1989, Clivillés and Cole formed a new group known as C+C Music Factory. The group included Clivillés and Cole, in addition to rapper Freedom Williams and Liberian singer/dancer Zelma Davis. In December 1990, C+C Music Factory released their debut album &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot;, which peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 200 Albums chart. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot;, which featured rap vocals by Freedom Williams and uncredited lead vocals by Martha Wash, became an international hit and peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100. The single went on to sell over a million copies in the United States, becoming certified platinum-status. Additionally, the single became number-one in five other countries. The success of the single also bolstered its parent album&#x27;s sales, helping it achieve multi-platinum status for sales exceeding five million copies in the United States.

In 1991, the group released two top-ten singles, &quot;Here We Go (Let&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll)&quot; and &quot;Things That Make You Go Hmmm...&quot; (inspired by a phrase uttered periodically by late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall), both of which became certified gold-status in the United States. In August 1991, the album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Just a Touch of Love&quot;, which featured vocals by Davis, was released and earned the group their fourth number-one dance hit. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the musical comedy film &quot;Sister Act&quot;. In the same year, C+C Music Factory embarked on their first international tour. During certain legs of the tour, Deborah Cooper, a backing vocalist from their album, was hired as a lead vocalist for specific concert venues as Zelma Davis was awaiting green card clearance. In 1992, the group released the single &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27; (Dance Till You Can&#x27;t Dance No More)&quot;, featuring Cooper and rapper Q-Unique on vocals. The single became their fifth song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the comedy horror film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. By the end of 1992, the group had earned a total of four American Music Awards, including an award for &quot;Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group&quot;.

===1994–1996: Subsequent releases and hiatus===
In 1994, C+C Music Factory experienced a lineup change. Wash, who had just settled a lawsuit with the group, was asked to join as a full-time vocalist. Williams left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by the vocal trio Trilogy. In August 1994, the group released their second album, titled &quot;Anything Goes!&quot;, which performed poorly on the Billboard&#x27;s Top 200 Albums chart. The lead single, &quot;Do You Wanna Get Funky&quot;, which featured vocals from Davis, Wash, and Trilogy, became a success on the Billboard charts and earned the group their sixth number-one dance hit. The album also featured two minor hits, &quot;Take a Toke&quot; and &quot;I Found Love&quot;.

On January 24, 1995, David Cole died from spinal meningitis. Despite the death of one of their core members, C+C Music Factory embarked on another international tour. In November 1995, they released their self-titled third album. The record was released by Robert Clivillés using the C+C Music Factory name, though it did not feature any musical contributions from Cole, Davis, or Wash, but retained the vocal contributions of Trilogy. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be Around&quot;, became their seventh number-one dance hit. The second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Remix&quot;, was the group&#x27;s final release before disbanding.

In October 1996, Clivillés released an album of new material under the name Robi-Rob&#x27;s Clubworld. That same year, a compilation album titled &quot;Robi Rob&#x27;s Clubworld – House of Sound presents Clubworld Shut Up and Dance&quot; was released exclusively in Japan. The album contains past singles and unreleased material recorded by C+C Music Factory.

===2010–2011: Comeback===
C+C Music Factory reformed in 2010 with Eric Kupper replacing Cole. They released the song &quot;Live Your Life&quot;, which featured singer Scarlett Santana, in early 2010, on a Bill Coleman&#x27;s Remixxer Compilation album. In August 2011, Santana released the single &quot;Rain&quot;, which was produced by C+C Music Factory (composed of Clivillés and Kupper credited as &quot;CnC Music Factory&quot;).

==Legacy==
As of 1995, C+C Music Factory have accumulated a total of seven number-one dance songs. &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot; was included in the top-ten VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot;.

In 2003, Freedom Williams acquired the federal trademark to use the name &quot;C and C Music Factory&quot; for live performances. Williams toured under that name until renewing his trademark to &quot;C &amp; C Music Factory&quot; in 2014. As of 2014, Williams has owned the trademark rights for the name for all related efforts, not just live performances. Founding producer Clivillés has labeled this &quot;the biggest insult in the world&quot;.

==Lawsuits==
In 1990, the Crew, a group composed of Clivillés, Cole, and Freedom Williams, released the single &quot;Get Dumb! (Free Your Body)&quot;. The song featured an unauthorized sample of Boyd Jarvis&#x27; 1983 song &quot;The Music Got Me&quot;. Jarvis filed a lawsuit against Cole and Clivillés as well as A&amp;M Records. The court ruled in favor of Jarvis.

Following the release of &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot; in November 1990, C+C Music Factory was hit with a lawsuit by Martha Wash, whose vocals were uncredited on the chorus. The song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demo tape. After discovering that the group was using Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with Clivillés and Cole for sleeve credits and royalties, which ultimately proved unsuccessful. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Robert Clivillés and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging, and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash&#x27;s vocals in the official music video) for &quot;visualization&quot; to the &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot; music video.

<text>Elkie Brooks (born Elaine Bookbinder; 25 February 1945) is an English rock, blues and jazz singer. She was a vocalist with the bands Dada and Vinegar Joe, and later became a solo artist. She gained her biggest success in the late 1970s and 1980s, releasing 13 UK Top 75 singles, and reached the top ten with &quot;Pearl&#x27;s a Singer&quot;, &quot;Sunshine After the Rain&quot; (both 1977), &quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over) (1981), and &quot;No More the Fool&quot; (1986). She has been nominated twice for the Brit Awards.

Brooks is a Gold Badge Award of Merit winner from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) (now The Ivors Academy) and is generally referred to as the &quot;British Queen of Blues&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early career and Vinegar Joe===
Brooks was born Elaine Bookbinder in Salford, to a Jewish family. Her father&#x27;s grandparents emigrated to Britain from Poland at the start of the 20th century to escape the pogroms. Her older brothers are Raymond Bookbinder and Anthony Bookbinder (Tony Mansfield of The Dakotas).

Whilst still a child, Brooks began singing at barmitzvahs and weddings; according to Brooks, her unofficial debut was a gig at a club called the Laronde on Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, when she was 13 years old. Aged 15, she won a talent contest in Manchester, leading to her taking part in a pop package tour which was promoted by Don Arden. Her first record, a cover of Etta James&#x27;s &quot;Something&#x27;s Got a Hold on Me,&quot; was released on Decca in 1964. Brooks spent most of the 1960s on Britain&#x27;s cabaret scene, a period of her life that she did not particularly enjoy. In the mid 1960s, she supported the Beatles in their Christmas show in London, then, as an established act, helped the Small Faces in their early career by introducing them at several venues. She went on to tour the United States with several bands, including the Animals. She also toured the then communist Poland with Jon Lord&#x27;s the Artwoods.

In the 1960s, Brooks had begun singing jazz with Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s band, but subsequently changed direction musically. After she met Pete Gage, whom she would marry, she joined the short-lived blues rock fusioneers Dada, before forming Vinegar Joe with Gage and Robert Palmer. Brooks gained the reputation as the wild woman of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, due to her wild stage performances. After three albums, Vinegar Joe split up in 1974, and Brooks and Palmer pursued separate solo careers. After a time as backing singer with the American southern boogie band Wet Willie, she returned to England.

===Solo career and chart success===
Brooks&#x27; first solo album, released on A &amp; M Records, was &quot;Rich Man&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1975). It was released to critical acclaim, but the album&#x27;s cover shot of a naked Brooks with a feather boa was considered outrageous for the time.

This came before a run of 16 albums in 20 years, starting with &quot;Two Days Away&quot; (1977), produced by the songwriting duo Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had previously worked with Elvis Presley; Brooks also wrote tracks with Leiber and Stoller. The hits &quot;Pearl&#x27;s a Singer&quot; (reaching No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart) and &quot;Sunshine After the Rain&quot; (which reached No. 10) came from this album. 1977 also saw Brooks duet with Cat Stevens on the song &quot;Remember the Days of the Old Schoolyard&quot; which reached No.33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and No.44 in UK. The albums &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (1978) and &quot;Live and Learn&quot; (1979) also saw success, along with the singles &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; produced and arranged by Mike Batt and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;. Her polished, powerful cover of Gallagher and Lyle&#x27;s &quot;The Runaway&quot; saw the Scottish singer-songwriters appear with Brooks on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to provide backing vocals.

In 1980, Brooks performed at the Knebworth Festival with The Beach Boys, Santana and Mike Oldfield. The &quot;Pearls&quot; album, released in 1981, was the biggest commercial success of her career, charting for 79 weeks and reaching No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was still in the charts a year later, when &quot;Pearls ll (1982)&quot; reached No. 5, spending 26 weeks on the charts. The Gus Dudgeon-produced &quot;Fool If You Think It&#x27;s Over (1981)&quot;, written by Chris Rea, was a major hit single for Brooks. Other chart singles followed, with &quot;Our Love&quot;, &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, all produced by Dudgeon. The 1984 albums &quot;Minutes&quot; and &quot;Screen Gems&quot; were both chart hits in the same year. In 1986, Brooks sang the title theme song for the BBC television series &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot;. Written by Dave Greenslade, it was never released commercially.

In early 1987, the song &quot;No More the Fool&quot; reached the top five for Brooks, and became her biggest hit single to date, with the parent album also reaching the top five. This led to her achieving another career peak, with two albums in the top ten and a single in the top ten in the same week. More chart success ensued with the albums &quot;The Very Best of Elkie Brooks&quot; (1986), &quot;Bookbinder&#x27;s Kid&quot; (1988), &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1989), &quot;Round Midnight&quot; (1993), &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Blues&quot; (1994), &quot;Amazing&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Very Best of Elkie Brooks&quot; (1997).

===Later work===
In March 2003, Brooks participated in the ITV music talent show &quot;Reborn in the USA&quot;, alongside musicians such as Peter Cox and Leee John. The same year, the album &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; was released, which saw her collaborate with Humphrey Lyttelton, with whom she had worked earlier in her career, and his Band. The album included &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot; with added lyrics. The &quot;Electric Lady&quot; album (2005), produced by her son Jermaine Jordan, saw a return to her blues and rock roots, featuring self-penned tracks alongside re-workings of numbers by the Doors, Bob Dylan, Paul Rodgers and Tony Joe White. The following year saw the release of her first official DVD, &quot;Elkie Brooks &amp; Friends: Pearls&quot;, featuring an array of guest musicians.

Brooks&#x27;s twentieth studio album, &quot;Powerless&quot;, also produced by Jordan, was released in 2010, featuring songs such as Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Make You Feel My Love.&quot; She continues to perform live throughout the UK and Ireland. In 2012, Brooks released her autobiography &quot;Finding My Voice&quot;, published by The Robson Press. In it, she detailed her life and career, focusing on her love of performing live and the downsides of the recording business, which she says has often left her financially no better off.

In July 2017, after Brooks signed to Virgin EMI, the album &quot;Pearls - The Very Best Of&quot;, was released. It charted at No. 14, and included two new singles: &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Something that You Can Get for Free&quot; and the Bryan Adams-penned &quot;Forgive and Forget.&quot; Later in the year, a remix of the 1979 album track &quot;The Rising Cost of Love&quot; was also released as a single. All three singles made it onto the Radio 2 &#x27;A&#x27; playlist, with &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; being the network&#x27;s &quot;Record of the Week.&quot; Brooks promoted the album with several appearances on Radio 2 programmes, including the &quot;Aled Jones Show&quot;, and &quot;The One Show&quot; on BBC One. On 19 September that year, Brooks appeared at the London Palladium to mark 40 years since her first sell-out week at the venue in 1977. The show also celebrated her 40 years of success since the release of the single &quot;Pearl&#x27;s a Singer.&quot;

The same year, Brooks recorded the closing theme song for the 2017 film &quot;Finding Your Feet&quot;, which starred Imelda Staunton, Timothy Spall, Celia Imrie and Joanna Lumley. The track, &quot;Running to the Future,&quot; was released as a download-only single, and included on the soundtrack album. Brooks&#x27; self-penned song &quot;Just An Excuse&quot; has been remixed several times, most notably appearing on the Bonobo album &quot;Migration&quot; in 2017. She has performed live since 1960; her 2021 tour, delayed from the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, was billed as her 60th Year Anniversary Tour.

Brooks has continued to tour, with concerts through 2023 and 2024. On 25 February 2025, to celebrate her 80th birthday, she was the guest at the &quot;Radio 2 Piano Room&quot; where she performed live, alongside the BBC Concert Orchestra, from the BBC Maida Vale Studios. Her set included the Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man song &quot;Human&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early to mid-1970s, Brooks was married to guitarist Pete Gage. On 1 March 1978, she married her sound engineer, Trevor Jordan, who had worked with Diana Ross, Rolling Stones, Luciano Pavarotti, Sarah Vaughan and many others. They live in Devon and have two sons, Jermaine (born 22 December 1979) and Joseph (born 31 December 1986). Between 1981 and 2002, they lived in a mansion in a secluded area of North Devon. However, in 1998, after her accountant informed her that he had not been paying her taxes, Brooks found herself in severe debt and was reduced to living in a mobile home. After four years of increasing interest bills and loans, Brooks managed to sell her home (after being threatened with repossession) and cleared all of her debts. In 2000, Brooks&#x27; management and tour promotion was taken over by her son, Jermaine, and his wife, Joanna.

<text>Maidenbower is one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley in West Sussex, England. Maidenbower is located in the south east corner of the town, bordering the M23 motorway. It is bordered by Pound Hill to the north and Furnace Green to the west across the railway line.

In 1986 Crawley Borough Council declared the farmland between the M23 and the London-Brighton railway line to be the 13th neighbourhood, named Maidenbower after one of the farms in the area. A consortium of builders was formed to develop the site which was to include community facilities and a new junction giving access to the M23.

By 2000 development was almost complete, although small areas of infill development continue.

The original 16th-century Frogshole farm building, unlike the adjoining Maidenbower farm that gave the area its name, remains as the public house for the neighbourhood. It was refurbished and opened in 1994. On 8 February 2007 it suffered a major fire. Frogshole Farm Pub re-opened in July 2008 after a major refurbishment.

A secondary school, the Oriel High School, has been built at Maidenbower under the Private Finance Initiative: a private company designed and built the school and is planned to provide facilities management for the next 25 years. West Sussex County Council provides all the educational services and staff. Maidenbower also has two infants schools and a large junior school.

There is a parade of shops and a community centre that provides daycare facilities for elderly people and people with disabilities. The Gatwick Stream runs through Maidenbower (formerly through Frogshole farm), past the back of the parade of shops and on to Three Bridges.

In September 2006, close to one of the entrance roads to Maidenbower leading from the Balcombe Road, a large piece of public art was installed. A community project, it was created in five pieces by the four schools in the neighbourhood and one piece by the community. The pieces fit together like a giant jigsaw puzzle to form an outline representing a map of the neighbourhood. The streams that run through it create the joins between each of the pieces. The overall theme of the piece is the history and development of Maidenbower.

<text>Hadeland () is a traditional district in the southeastern part of Norway. It is centered on the southern part of the large lake Randsfjorden in Innlandet and Akershus counties. The district consists of the municipalities Gran in Innlandet county and Jevnaker and Lunner in Akershus county. Hadeland occupies the area north of the hills of Nordmarka close to the Norwegian capital Oslo. The soil around the Randsfjorden is amongst the most fertile in Norway. Hadeland accounts for just 5% of the country&#x27;s area, but it represents 13% of its agricultural land. Farmers harvest grains and potatoes. Pigs, dairy cattle, and horses are also bred at farms there.

Jevnaker is located to the southern and western side of the Randsfjorden. Gran&#x27;s rolling countryside is home to about two-thirds of the nearly 30,000 people living in Hadeland. The village of Jaren serves as the area&#x27;s main center of commerce. The municipality of Gran is divided by the Randsfjorden, and its western part is known as the &quot;Fjorda&quot; district.

The Hadeland area includes large stretches of woodlands. About 70% of Lunner is covered by forest. Nearly half of the wooded area in Lunner and Jevnaker is common land (almenning). The local forestry cooperative plays a key role in the economies of the two areas. Their woods are home to a variety of flora and fauna, and host a number of species of birds, deer, moose, and other wildlife. Populations of trout, char, bass, and other freshwater fish have dwindled in the inland lakes and streams, but restocking efforts are now made.

==Etymology==
The name of Hadeland comes from the Old Norse name for the inhabitants, &quot;haðar&quot;, which is assumed to be connected to war. The name would then mean &quot;the land of the warriors.&quot;

==History==

A number of Stone Age sites have been discovered around the Randsfjorden and over 200 artifacts - including jewelry, tools, and weapons - have been unearthed. During this period the people here, as in most of southern Norway, lived as hunter-gatherers, exploiting the resources of the large forests.

By the end of the Bronze Age, agriculture had evolved and archaeological evidence points to the division of land into family or clan-based farms. Several Bronze Age burial mounds have been identified in Hadeland.

Roman references to this area as Hadeland may be found in documents dating from AD200-400. The name refers to the &quot;haðar&quot; people. It is thought that &quot;haðar&quot; may relate to one of the many tribes or clans in the area, thus Hadeland would mean &quot;land of the haðar&quot;. Archaeologists have found a wide variety of weapons in Iron Age burial sites throughout Hadeland. In the late Iron Age, Hadeland was a petty kingdom. One of the more prominent kings of Hadeland was Halfdan Hvitbeinn who lived in the 8th century.
According to the Icelandic sagas early Viking Age chieftains enjoyed hunting and entertaining their entourages in the forests and on the lakes in this area. King Halfdan the Black, father of king Harald Fairhair who united Norway, often visited Hadeland. According to historical sources he and his men attended a banquet here in the winter of 860. As they were crossing the ice on Randsfjorden on their way home to Ringerike, the ice gave way and horses, men, and the 40-year-old king himself drowned. The Hadeland Folkemuseum is built around a Viking burial mound at Granavollen which according to folklore contains the torso of King Halvdan.

The name Hadeland appears on the Dynna stone, a runestone from about 1040-1050. Norway formally adopted Christianity in 1030, and the Dynna stone, with its scenes from the Nativity is one of the first Christian monuments in Norway. A number of medieval churches survive in Hadeland. Notable among them is the Old Tingelstad Church. This was built in the 13th century. Other churches include Lunner Church and the Sister Churches at Granavollen. The Black Death arrived in Norway in the mid 14th century, and it is estimated that two-thirds of the population of Hadeland was wiped out.

<text>Cyanotrichite is a hydrous copper aluminium sulfate mineral with formula Cu4Al2[(OH)12|SO4]·2H2O, also known as lettsomite. Cyanotrichite forms velvety radial acicular crystal aggregates of extremely fine fibers. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system and forms translucent bright blue acicular crystal clusters or drusey coatings. The Mohs hardness is 2 and the specific gravity ranges from 2.74 to 2.95. Refractive indices are nα = 1.588 nβ = 1.617 nγ = 1.655.

==Occurrence and discovery==
It is an oxidation product of primary copper mineralization in a weathering environment with abundant aluminium and sulfate. Associated minerals include brochantite, spangolite, chalcophyllite, olivenite, tyrolite, parnauite, azurite and malachite.

The main deposits are Cap la Garrone in the Var (France), Romania and Arizona (US). 

It was first described in 1839 from Moldova Nouă, Banat, Romania. The name is from Greek &quot;kyaneos&quot; for &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;triches&quot; for &quot;hair&quot; referring to the typical color and habit. Its earlier name, Lettsomite, is taken from the name of William Garrow Lettsom (1805–1887), co-author of the 1858 &quot;Manual of the Mineralogy of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;.

<doc id="1120797" wikidata="Q633253" url="?curid=1120797" title="Valentinite">
<text>Valentinite is an antimony oxide mineral with formula Sb2O3. Valentinite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and typically forms as radiating clusters of euhedral crystals or as fibrous masses. It is colorless to white with occasional shades or tints of yellow and red. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and a specific gravity of 5.76. Valentinite occurs as a weathering product of stibnite and other antimony minerals. It is dimorphous with the isometric antimony oxide senarmontite.

==Historical data==
Valentinite is a mineral named in the middle of the 19th century in honour of Basilius Valentinus, a writer on alchemy. He is the supposed author of the first book to give a detailed description of antimony and its compounds. From the contents of the book it is also obvious that Valentinus was familiar with the synthetic preparation of antimony trioxide, which was called &#x27;the antimony flower&#x27;.

Valentinite was first described in 1845 for an occurrence in the Les Chalanches Mine, Allemond, Isère, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France. The first description of its occurrence in the region of Příbram in Bohemia comes roughly from the same time. This particular locality at one time produced the very best crystals of this mineral. The largest crystals found there measured up to 3 cm. Grouped in rich druses, they developed in vein cavities with galena.

==Occurrence==

Valentinite is a weathering product of hydrothermal antimony-bearing veins, where it forms as a secondary mineral through oxidation in the upper parts of the deposits. It occurs associated with stibnite, native antimony, stibiconite, cervantite, kermesite and tetrahedrite.

A rich deposit of valentinite has been found in the Constantine province of Algeria. This is the only deposit where it is mined as an ore, with 83% antimony. In all other locations it occurs in negligible quantities.

<doc id="1120800" wikidata="Q8037155" url="?curid=1120800" title="Worth, West Sussex">
<text>Worth is either a civil parish in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, or a distinct but historically related village in Crawley.

==Civil parish==
Worth is a civil parish in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, a county in southeast England. It includes the villages of Copthorne and Crawley Down, and covers an area of . The population at the time of the 2001 census was 9,888. In the 2011 census it had increased to 10,378.

The parish of Worth was one of the larger West Sussex parishes, encompassing the entire area along the West Sussex/Surrey border between the town of Crawley, east of its High Street, and East Grinstead. The creation of Turners Hill civil parish brought Worth to a third of its original size.

Despite their names, neither Worth Abbey, an English Benedictine monastery, nor Worth School are located in the modern Worth civil parish. They are in what is now Turners Hill civil parish.

==Village==

Worth village is now an area within the neighbourhood of Pound Hill in the borough of Crawley. It was formerly a separate village, and its name is still used for the civil parish in which it was originally situated.

Worth village has Saxon origins: Worth Church still retains its Saxon floor plan. The Wealden iron industry flourished here in the 17th and 18th centuries. The coming of the railway in 1855 brought more employment to the area, but the line closed in 1967.

The place appears under Surrey in the Domesday book, with the old spelling &quot;Orðe&quot; (pronounced with a silent initial &#x27;w&#x27; as in &#x27;one&#x27;, and including the Saxon letter &#x27;ð&#x27; which sounds a soft &#x27;th&#x27;. The Domesday book&#x27;s entries for Sussex, by comparison, list Worthing as &quot;Ordinges&quot; and Petworth as &quot;Peteorde&quot;).

With the creation of Crawley New Town, Worth village became part of it, in the Pound Hill ward; the title of the ward was changed in 2004 to &quot;Pound Hill South and Worth&quot;. It is common for signposts to be altered to use the Worth name instead of Pound Hill by local residents.

The ecclesiastical parish, part of the Diocese of Chichester, maintains the distinction, and is formally entitled &quot;The Parish of Worth, Maidenbower and Pound Hill.&quot;

Worth Park House, a large country house, once stood on the Milton Mount housing estate, now part of Pound Hill, Crawley. The house was home to Sir Joseph Montefiore and his family. The gardens have recently been restored.

==Notable Parish Register==
The 1654-1751 parish register for Worth is notable for recording the burials of unbaptized infants. This gives a much fuller picture of the rate of new born deaths than is usually visible in records of the time.

<text>Boltzmann is an old lunar impact crater that is located along the southern limb of the Moon, in the vicinity of the south pole. At this location the crater is viewed from the side from Earth, and so not much detail can be seen. It is located to the north of the walled plain Drygalski, and to the west of the crater Le Gentil.

This formation has become eroded by many tiny impacts, leaving the features rounded and worn. Little of the original rim still stands above the surrounding terrain, leaving only a depression in the surface. The interior is relatively flat, with a rougher surface in the eastern half. There are several tiny craterlets on the crater interior, including a pair near the southwest inner wall and a small, bowl-shaped crater close to the eastern rim. 

To the southeast of the crater rim is an arcing &quot;catena&quot; formation of tiny craterlets that joins the rim of Boltzmann to the northern rim of Drygalski.

<text>London Sounds Eastern was one of the most popular ethnic minority radio programs on the BBC. It was presented by Vernon Corea and produced by Keith Yeomans.

==The Launching of London Sounds Eastern -BBC Radio London==
The program went on the airwaves on a Sunday evening on BBC Radio London. It enjoyed a huge multi-cultural radio audience and was even highlighted in the BBC Radio Times in 1976. &quot;London Sounds Eastern&quot; created broadcasting history in the United Kingdom: it was the first ever Asian programme in English, on the BBC. Until the launch of &#x27;London Sounds Eastern,&#x27; Asian radio programmes in the United Kingdom were mostly in the Hindi and Urdu languages and the programme replaced two 30-minute shows which had been broadcast in the Bengali, Hindi and Urdu languages.

==Ethnic Minority Broadcasting on the BBC==
&#x27;London Sounds Eastern&#x27; was a real breakthrough in terms of ethnic minority broadcasting. It expanded musical horizons featuring music as diverse as the ghazals of Pakistan, raagas from India and baila from Sri Lanka. It even featured music from China and Singapore.

Vernon Corea, presenter of London Sounds Eastern was appointed Asian Programmes Officer of the BBC and trained broadcasters from minority ethnic communities for the BBC Local Radio network. Among those who sought advice on a career in radio was the BBC TV Presenter George Alagiah. Vernon Corea went on to be the BBC&#x27;s Ethnic Minorities Adviser.

==South Asian Stars on the BBC==
A whole host of Asian stars were featured - Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Usha Uthup, Ravi Shankar, Pandith Amaradeva, Asian actress Jamila Massey and her husband the writer Reginald Massey, Clarence Wijewardene, Annesley Malewana, Mignonne Fernando, Nimal Mendis, The Gypsies, Desmond de Silva were some of the South Asian stars on &#x27;London Sounds Eastern.&#x27; Their music reached new audiences in London and hundreds of fans wrote in to BBC Radio London. Vernon Corea featured the different sounds of the Indian sub-continent, from ragaas to contemporary baila.

==South Asian Heads of State on the programme==
Heads of State have also appeared on the radio programme among them the President of Sri Lanka. Vernon Corea, the presenter of &#x27;London Sounds Eastern&#x27; also met with the President of the Maldives when he was invited to the islands to train Maldivian broadcasters at Radio Maldives.

==BBC Asian Network==
The programme pioneered the way for the BBC Asian Network. Ravi Shankar was among the celebrities interviewed by Vernon Corea for &quot;London Sounds Eastern&quot;.

<text>Brashear is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon, in the southern hemisphere in the vicinity of the south pole. The crater is named after the American astronomer John A. Brashear. It lies just to the south of the walled plain Antoniadi, within the larger crater&#x27;s outer of ejecta. To the northeast besides Antoniadi is the crater Numerov, and southeast lies the younger De Forest.

This formation is little more than a shallow depression in the lunar surface, its features eroded and blanketed by the ejecta from the relatively fresh crater Antoniadi just to the north.

The satellite crater Brashear P lies to the south-southwest. This formation is a heavily worn crater with features that have been almost completely worn away by subsequent impacts. Connected to the southern rim of this crater is a series of valleys and impact craters leading a couple of hundred kilometres to the east.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brashear.

<text>Grotrian is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the north of the huge walled plain Schrödinger, within the radius of that formation&#x27;s outer blanket of ejecta. The long Vallis Planck formation begins just to the north of Grotrian, and continues to the north-northwest towards Pikel&#x27;ner.

The outer wall of this crater forms a very nearly circular shape, with the smaller crater Hawke across the southern rim breaking up the symmetry. The interior surfaces form relatively smooth slopes that continue down to the material deposited across the bottom. Apart from Hawke and a small crater on the northern edge of the rim, this formation has not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Grotrian.

<text>Van Wijk is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the southern part of the far side of the Moon. It is located to the north-northwest of the huge walled plain Schrödinger, and to the southwest of the crater Fechner.

The rim of this crater has a noticeable outward bulge toward the south, but it is otherwise relatively circular. The perimeter remains relatively sharp-edged, with some wear along the north and northwest faces. The inner walls slope down evenly towards the relatively flat and featureless interior.

<text>Wexler is a lunar impact crater that lies across the south-southeast limb of the Moon. In this location not much detail about the formation can be discerned from the Earth, and it must be viewed from orbit to see most of the structure. It lies about a hundred kilometers northwards of the larger crater Hale, and south-southeast of Petrov.

The rim of this crater retains much of its original structure, although the features have become softened and worn in comparison to the younger Hale. The rim has a polygonal appearance along most of the perimeter, and traces of s can still be seen along sections of the inner wall. There is a small crater across the northwest rim, but otherwise the formation is not significantly marked by impacts. The interior floor is relatively flat and level, with a central peak near the midpoint. There is the ghostly remnant of a crater to the northeast of the middle peak.

Within a half crater diameter to the north and east is a wide, valley-like rift in the surface. The narrow end of this cut is located to the east of Wexler, and from there it follows a nearly straight, widening course to the northeast, before opening wide towards the northwest to the north of Wexler.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Wexler.

<text>IC 2118 (also known as Witch Head Nebula due to its shape) is an extremely faint reflection nebula believed to be an ancient supernova remnant or gas cloud illuminated by nearby supergiant star Rigel in the constellation of Orion. The nebula lies in the Eridanus Constellation, about 900 light-years from Earth. The nature of the dust particles, reflecting blue light better than red, is a factor in giving the Witch Head its blue color. Radio observations show substantial carbon monoxide emission throughout parts of IC 2118, an indicator of the presence of molecular clouds and star formation in the nebula. In fact candidates for pre-main sequence stars and some classic T Tauri stars have been found deep within the nebula.

The molecular clouds of IC 2118 are probably juxtaposed to the outer boundaries of the vast Orion-Eridanus bubble, a giant supershell of molecular hydrogen blown by the high mass stars of the Orion OB1 association. As the supershell expands into the interstellar medium, favorable circumstances for star formation occur. IC 2118 is located in one such area. The wind blown appearance and cometary shape of the bright reflection nebula is highly suggestive of a strong association with the high mass luminous stars of Orion OB1. The fact that the heads of the cometary clouds of IC2118 point northeast towards the association is strong support of that relationship.

<text>3D radar provides for radar ranging and direction in three dimensions. In addition to range, the more common two-dimensional radar provides only azimuth for direction, whereas the 3D radar also provides elevation. Applications include weather monitoring, air defense, and surveillance.

The information provided by 3D radar has long been required, particularly for air defence and interception. Interceptors must be told the altitude to climb to before making an intercept. Before the advent of single unit 3D radars, this was achieved with separate search radars (giving range and azimuth) and separate height finding radars that could examine a target to determine altitude. These had little search capability, so were directed to a particular azimuth first found by the primary search radar.

== Techniques ==
Steered beam radars steer a narrow beam through a scan pattern to build a 3-D picture. Examples include NEXRAD Doppler weather radar (which uses a parabolic dish) and the AN/SPY-1 passive electronically scanned array radar employed by the Ticonderoga class of guided missile cruisers and other ships so equipped with the Aegis Combat System.

Stacked beam radars emit and/or receive multiple beams of radio waves at two or more elevation angles. By comparing the relative strengths of the returns from each beam, the elevation of the target can be deduced. An example of a stacked beam radar is the Air Route Surveillance Radar.

<doc id="1120863" wikidata="Q2292774" url="?curid=1120863" title="Up the Bracket">
<text>Up the Bracket is the debut album by English indie rock band The Libertines, released in October 2002. It reached #35 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was part of a resurgence for the British indie/alternative scene and received widespread praise from critics and has quickly become considered one of the greatest albums of the 2000s.

The album&#x27;s cover is based on an image of riot police squaring up to protesters during the Argentine economic crisis of 1999–2002.

==Title==
The title &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; alludes to a phrase used by English comedian Tony Hancock, of whom the Libertines&#x27; Pete Doherty is an avid fan. In &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Up The Bracket&quot; is a slang term meaning a punch in the throat. Hancock is also referenced in the opening track, &quot;Vertigo&quot; – &quot;lead pipes, your fortune&#x27;s made&quot;, being a line from the &quot;Half Hour&quot; episode &quot;The Poetry Society&quot;.

==Release==
The album was re-released on 8 September 2003 with an additional track, &quot;What a Waster&quot; and DVD featuring the promotional videos for the singles: &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, &quot;Time for Heroes&quot; and &quot;I Get Along&quot;.

In 2022 the album was reissued as 20th anniversary editions and box set that featured &quot;Live at the 100 Club&quot; disc, a disc of studio outtakes, a disc of demos/radio sessions/b-sides/live tracks, a cassette of early demos and DVD with music videos and live performances.

==Reception==

Upon release, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; received generally favourable reviews. Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; at number 138 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s, and it was placed 44 on a similar list by &quot;Uncut&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; placed the album tenth in a list of the greatest British albums ever, as well as calling it the second greatest album of the decade. NME also placed the album number 70 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album number 61 on its list of the 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All Time and number 94 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 2000s.

In April 2008, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe chose the album as one of his Masterpieces, playing the album in full with interviews from the band members, fans and fellow musicians who were influenced by the album.

<doc id="1120869" wikidata="Q2344027" url="?curid=1120869" title="John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol">
<text>John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol (February 1580 – 21 January 1653), was an English diplomat and a moderate royalist during the English Civil War.

== Early career ==
He was the son of Sir George Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire, and Abigail, daughter of Sir Anthony (not Arthur) Heveningham and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the Inner Temple. He was knighted in 1606. He was briefly the Member of Parliament for Hedon in 1610.

On his arrival at Court, his charm, good looks and diplomatic ability quickly gained him the favour of King James I, who sent him to Madrid as his ambassador to Spain during the early 1610s. Digby uncovered details of Spanish pensions paid to the late Earl of Salisbury, the naval officer William Monson, Lady Jane Drummond, and the Countess of Suffolk. Digby was rewarded for his service as a diplomat by being created Baron Digby of Sherborne in 1618 and Earl of Bristol in 1622.

Digby was a leading figure in the unsuccessful Spanish Match, the effort to marry Prince Charles to the Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. Digby was made the scapegoat for the failure of the marriage plan, recalled and ordered to reside on his estates. Charles after his accession offered Digby a return to royal favour if he would admit his blame for the failure of the match: Digby, who was a stubborn and hot-tempered man, and could be terrifying in his anger, refused. Charles, infuriated, impeached him and sent him to the Tower of London; Digby, undaunted, made counter-charges against George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the prime royal favourite. Ominously for the King&#x27;s reputation, the House of Lords decided to hear Digby in his own defence first. His trial never proceeded, although he remained in the Tower until 1628, and the affair seriously damaged the King&#x27;s reputation as a man of honour.

The murder of the Duke of Buckingham in August 1628 caused Digby to reconsider his opposition to the King: like Strafford and others among the Lords he was alarmed at Parliament&#x27;s increasing radicalism. He offered his services to Charles and was formally reconciled with him. Charles, however, was slow to trust those who had ever opposed him and Digby had little influence at Court in the 1630s.

== Civil War ==
As the political crisis of the early 1640s mounted, Digby emerged as a trusted and moderate royal adviser, along with his son George, Lord Digby. At the Council of Peers held at York in September 1640, the King showed an unprecedented willingness to listen to Bristol&#x27;s criticism of his policy, and agreed to his advice that a Parliament must be summoned. 1641 saw a complete reconciliation between the two men: Bristol with Lord Bedford became leader of the moderate Royalists in the House of Lords, working to achieve a compromise with John Pym, and save the Earl of Strafford&#x27;s life. After the collapse of the attempt at compromise Bristol came increasingly to be seen as a &quot;hardline&quot; royalist: as such Parliament imprisoned him after the outbreak of the Civil War, although he was later allowed to join the King at Oxford. After the Battle of Edgehill he was one of the &quot;moderate party&quot; who persuaded the King not to attempt to take London, which might have brought the war to a swift conclusion. After the King&#x27;s defeat, he moved to Paris and died there in 1653 aged 72.

Clarendon, who knew and liked Bristol, gave this sketch of him:

&quot;Of a grave aspect, of a presence which drew respect, and a very handsome man who by the extraordinary favour of King James to his person was Ambassador to Spain before he was 30. Though he was a man of great parts and a wise man in Council he was passionate and supercilious and was too voluminous in discourse so that he was not considered there with much respect.&quot;

A modern historian praises him as the greatest servant of the English Crown of his generation, but humorously calls him &quot;the terrible earl&quot;, on account of his hot temper and intimidating personality.

== Marriage and progeny ==

Lord Bristol lived at Sherborne Castle, Dorset. He married Beatrice Walcott (died 1658), widow of Sir John Dyve of Bromham, Bedfordshire, in 1609 and they had four surviving children:

*George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol
*Mary Digby (1612–1648), who married as his 2nd wife Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall (1606–1674). They had six sons and one daughter, all of whom died in infancy. She died on 5 November 1648 while giving birth to a second daughter stillborn. She was buried in Eggesford Church, Devon, where is situated her memorial effigy.
*John Digby (1618–1664)
*Abigail Digby (d 1640), married George Freke of Sherbourne, Dorset (son of John Freke) and bore one son, John.

Through her previous marriage, Lady Bristol was the mother of the prominent Royalist Sir Lewis Dyve.

Digby was the uncle of Sir Kenelm Digby, English courtier, diplomat and a highly reputed natural philosopher.

<text>Adams Park is a football stadium in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. Built in 1990, it is the home ground of the local Wycombe Wanderers Football Club in League One, with a capacity of 10,446. It was also leased from 2002 to 2014 to the rugby union club London Wasps from Aviva Premiership, and from 2016 to 2020 to the Reading Women. From the 2003–04 season to the 2005–06 season, the stadium was officially called Causeway Stadium, named after its sponsor Causeway Technologies.

==History==
===Pre-construction===
Wycombe Wanderers had sought to leave their home ground at Loakes Park since the 1960s as the site had been earmarked for the site of development of the adjacent Wycombe Hospital. The club were able to sell the land to the health authority, which almost solely funded the construction of Adams Park.

===Opening===
The ground is located in a valley at the end of the Sands Industrial Estate, surrounded by green hills on three sides. Whereas Wycombe&#x27;s previous Loakes Park ground was very close to the town centre, Adams Park is two miles due west of High Wycombe and less easily accessible either by public or private transport.

The stadium was opened in time for the 1990–91 season, and had a capacity of 6,000 with 1,267 seats in the Main Stand. The ground was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams. Adams had bought the former ground Loakes Park for the club, whose sale financed the move to the stadium named after him. The new stadium coincided with an upturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes as, under manager Martin O&#x27;Neill, they won the FA Trophy at Wembley thanks to a 2–1 win over Kidderminster Harriers.

==Renovations==
===1990s===
The initial licensed capacity of Adams Park was 6,000. This gradually rose as Wycombe Wanderers improved the provision of crush barriers on the terraces. Shortly after entering the Football League for the first time in 1993, these upgrades were completed, taking the capacity to around 9,500. In the summer of 1996 the 4,990-seater Woodlands Stand was built on the hill behind the erstwhile Woodlands Terrace. The Hillbottom Road End, where the visiting fans are accommodated, was seated, reducing its capacity from 2,131 standing spaces to 1,049 seats. The latter development had created problems when large numbers of visiting fans came to the ground, outstripping the supply of seats in that end when sides like Watford, Birmingham City and Manchester City visited. The capacity of the stadium was fixed at 10,000 to comply with council regulations, as the positioning of the stadium on a dead-end road was leading to problems when large crowds were leaving the ground, particularly with parking cars in the streets of the nearby residential suburb of Sands.

===2001===
In the summer of 2001 the Hillbottom Road End was extended by an extra 977 seats to take its capacity to 2,026. This was done mainly to be able to accommodate more away fans in one place when the need arose. However, the capacity was kept at 10,000 by reducing the official capacity of the standing areas at the Valley End and on the paddock in front of the Main Stand.

===2002===
In 2002, rugby union team London Wasps (later just known as Wasps), became tenants to Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park after losing their previous groundsharing agreement with Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road.

===2005===
In July 2005, a capacity crowd of 10,000 was registered for the first time, when Premiership champions Chelsea brought a team to play Wycombe in a pre-season friendly. It was during this season that the idea that Adams Park would be further expanded was mooted by senior figures at Wycombe Wanderers and Wasps so that it can comply to the Rugby Football Union regulations for Premiership grounds in the future. These stipulated that stadiums would have a capacity of at least 12,000 by 2007/08. It was initially suggested that a stand identical to the Woodlands Stand be built where the Main Stand is currently situated, and options to add additional tiers to the Valley End of the ground were also discussed. These plans, however, never came to fruition, as the RFU&#x27;s requirement to increase the capacity of the grounds was quietly dropped soon afterwards after a general decline in attendances, as well as the major difficulties that would have arisen from trying to add additional access routes to the stadium.

===2013===
On 6 March 2013, Adams Park hosted rugby league for the first time after London Broncos were forced to move their game against Bradford to High Wycombe due to pitch problems at their usual home ground the Twickenham Stoop.

On 21 March 2013, it hosted an England national under-21 football team international friendly against Romania&#x27;s under-21s with the hosts beat the visitors 3–0 goals from Wilfried Zaha, Jack Robinson and Nathan Delfouneso with 6,354 in attendance.

===2014===
On 8 October 2014, it was announced that London Wasps would leave Adams Park by December 2014, ending their 12-year ground-share with Wycombe Wanderers. They purchased and moved to the larger Ricoh Arena in Coventry.

==New name==
In 2003 the stadium was renamed the &quot;Causeway Stadium&quot;. For £100,000 over three years, local technology company Causeway bought the naming rights to the ground. This caused some anger amongst fans as the ground was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams. Adams had bought the former ground Loakes Park for the club, whose sale financed the move to the stadium named after him. The Causeway Technologies sponsorship expired at the end of the 2005–06 season and the ground name has reverted to Adams Park.

==New development plans==
There have been a number of plans to either extend the capacity of Adams Park beyond the current permitted maximum of 10,000 on the current site since Adams Park was opened, or to build a new stadium elsewhere in High Wycombe.

===2005===
Wycombe District Council outlined long-term plans for the regeneration of the Abbey Barn area of the town. These included a possible 20,000 capacity stadium near the site of the since-closed Wycombe Heights dry ski slope.

===2006===
Plans were drawn up for a new access route to the ground through land owned by the wealthy Dashwood family to the north and west of Adams Park, allowing the expansion of its capacity up to 15,000. Wasps announced proposals to build an additional two tiers of seating on the back of the existing Valley End terrace, with this structure filling in the corner round to the large Woodlands Stand, enclosing that section of the ground.

2006 saw the construction of new club shop and offices.

===2007===
At a Wycombe Wanderers supporters&#x27; forum, CEO and minority shareholder of Wycombe Wanderers, and owner of London Wasps Steve Hayes announced plans to build a new stadium in the High Wycombe area, with a capacity of 17,000 – 20,000 and being the first UK stadium in modern times to have terracing. The new stadium would be jointly owned by WWFC, London Wasps and Wycombe District Council. The plans included retail outlets, a hotel and conference facilities.

Steve Hayes would later become 100% owner of Wycombe Wanderers in 2008.

===2008===
The stadium land was taken out of the Green Belt by a Government inspector, meaning the land value rose from £4,000 per acre to £1,000,000 per acre, giving a better resale value if required. The move would also allow additional stands, permanent or temporary, to be constructed to gain the 12,500 capacity required by London Wasps under Guinness Premiership regulations for the coming season. However, the main problem of access still remained, which meant that London Wasps would still be looking to move to a larger stadium.

===2011===
Steve Hayes, who owned both Wycombe Wanderers F.C. and London Wasps R.U.F.C. at the time, announced his intentions to build a new stadium for both clubs on the site of Wycombe Air Park in Booker, miles away from Adams Park. His plans encountered large-scale opposition from community groups and Wycombe Wanderers supporters, with concerns ranging from the loss of aeronautical activity at the air park to inappropriate green belt development. There were also objections by many Wycombe Wanderers supporters and Wycombe Wanderers Supporters&#x27; Trust who believed the club would not receive the proceeds of the sale of Adams Park (which it owned 100%), but that these would go to Steve Hayes to help finance a 20,000-capacity stadium in conjunction with Wycombe District Council that would then be rented to Wycombe Wanderers. &lt;br&gt;
The plans were abandoned in July 2011 when Wycombe District Council decided to end its support of the project in the face of increased scepticism about the viability of the project.

==Structure==
===Origin Stand (North)===

Built in 1990, the stand has a capacity of 1,267, all seated (but spectators may stand in the paddock at the front of this stand if they already have a valid seat ticket). The stand also contains the club offices, changing rooms, club shop and catering facilities.

===WhiffAway Stand (East)===
Originally called the Hillbottom Road End, the east end of the stadium was originally a terrace with a capacity of 2,131 when Adams Park was opened in 1990, almost identical to the Valley End at the opposite end of the ground. Along with the construction of the new Woodlands stand in 1996, 1,047 seats were installed in the Hillbottom Road End. In 2002, the capacity was increased in size to the current 2,053 all-seated capacity, with a space for 10 wheelchairs. Supporters of the visiting team are allocated this stand for Wycombe Wanderers matches.
After a number of crowd disturbances from supporters of visiting clubs who had sold out the full allocation of tickets, the licensed capacity of the stand has been reduced to 1,800. 
The stand has been renamed a number of times after commercial deals – the current official name is the Troo Stand.

===Frank Adams Stand (South)===
Originally a single level terrace, this stand was expanded into a two-tier unit in 1996. When redeveloped in 1996, the stand had a capacity of 4,990 (2,842 in the upper tier, 1,738 plus 50 wheelchair spaces in the lower tier) the South Stand contains boxes for corporate hospitality, with the lower tier designated as the stadium&#x27;s Family Stand.

This side of the ground is also known as the Woodlands side of the ground, but was renamed to its current official name, Frank Adams Stand, to ensure that at least some of stadium would still be named in honour of the former Wycombe Wanderers&#x27; captain and benefactor when the stadium was renamed Causeway Stadium between 2003 and 2006. Since the stadium changed its name back to Adams Park, the stand has officially retained the Frank Adams name.
In the summer of 2017, the end blocks of the lower tier had a total of 163 seats removed, replaced with a tarpaulin bearing an advertisement for a club sponsor. However, in 2018, the club installed 68 &#x27;20/20&#x27; seats at the empty block nearest to the Valley End. These were installed to showcase a new type of seating accommodation that would allow spectators to stand in front of their seat without blocking someone sitting behind them. The capacity of the stand has been reduced to 4,895 following these changes.

===The Bill Turnbull Gantry===
The gantry at the back of the Frank Adams Stand was renamed in September 2022 in honour of the late broadcaster Bill Turnbull, who had supported Wycombe and previously used to commentate on fixtures from the position.

===Beechdean Terrace (West)===

Originally called the Valley End, the Beechdean Terrace is the home supporters&#x27; end for football matches, and the only remaining standing accommodation in the stadium. The original licensed capacity of the terrace was 2,136; however, this was reduced by the club to 1,717 to maintain a total licensed capacity for the whole stadium of 10,000 after the extension of the Hillbottom Road end by 1,000 seats in 2001. After the Sports Grounds Safety Authority re-evaluated the extent of the viewing area on the Valley End that was permitted to be included in the total capacity calculation in October 2015, the terrace&#x27;s maximum capacity was provisionally reduced from 2,131 (officially licensed 1,717) to 1,494 pending remedial work to be carried out by the club in the near future.

==Facilities==
The stadium contains two hospitality suites, the Caledonian Suite, located behind the Beechdean Stand, and the Woodlands Suite, situated on the Executive Box level of the Frank Adams Stand.

The ground also contains a bar, called Monty&#x27;s (named after late club president Monty Seymour), and since 2006 a club shop in the corner of the ground between the PreSonus and Troo stands.

<text>The Amateur Marriage, published in 2004, is American author Anne Tyler&#x27;s sixteenth novel.

==Plot summary==

The plot concerns the marriage of Michael Anton and Pauline Barclay, who meet when he tends to her bloodied brow in his family&#x27;s grocery store, located in a primarily Eastern European enclave in Baltimore, in December 1941. They marry after Michael is discharged from the Army with a permanent injury caused by a deliberate shot from someone he assaulted.

Michael and Pauline settle in a small apartment above the store, but their widely different temperaments and expectations quickly create dissension in the relationship. He is repressed, controlling, and quiet; she is loud, emotional, and romantic. At Pauline&#x27;s insistence, they move to the suburbs, where they raise three children: Lindy, George and Karen.

&quot;Lindy, who has always been a stubborn, willful child, becomes increasingly defiant as a teenager, and one day, she just leaves home -- and doesn&#x27;t return. Her disappearance -- like the abrupt, sometimes violent events that occur in many Tyler novels, propelling heretofore passive characters into a re-evaluation of their lives -- does not bring her parents closer together, but instead results in another round of accusations and recriminations.&quot; Lindy runs away to San Francisco in 1960 and becomes involved in the growing drug culture. Eight years later, her parents retrieve Pagan, Lindy&#x27;s three-year-old son, while Lindy detoxes in a rehab community.

&quot;The lives of the Antons, of course, are not just about fighting; Pauline and Michael are also tied to each other by their children, by shared adventures and, as the years pass, by bonds of memory and inertia. Caring for aging parents, witnessing the illnesses and travails of friends, adapting to a move to the suburbs -- these are all experiences that bind Pauline and Michael to each other, even as their very different temperaments and interests increasingly pull them apart.&quot; The slowly crumbling marriage finally dissolves when Michael leaves Pauline on their 30th anniversary. For Michael, convinced that he and Pauline didn&#x27;t have the faintest idea what they were doing when they married or how to conduct a marriage (that they were &quot;amateurs&quot;), divorce is a salvation. For Pauline, it&#x27;s a tragedy that leaves her in despair.

The last third of the novel pursues how Michael, Pauline, and their children deal with moving on with the rest of their lives after the divorce. Michael remarries and Pauline forms new friendships but struggles with loneliness and dealing with day-to-day demands of an older single woman living in a big old house.

==Reviews==

Michiko Kakutani wrote in her &quot;New York Times&quot; review: &quot;Though &quot;The Amateur Marriage&quot; can leave the longtime Tyler fan with the sense that the author is simply reconnoitering territory long ago annexed and mapped out, it is so psychologically detailed that the story as a whole stands as one of her more convincing efforts: an ode to the complexities of familial love, the centripetal and centrifugal forces that keep families together and send their members flying apart, the supremely ordinary pleasures and frustrations of middle-class American life.&quot;

William H. Pritchard: &quot;&quot;The Amateur Marriage&quot; is...Tyler&#x27;s most ambitious work, ranging over 60 years of American experience, from the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the anniversary of that day in 2001...An aspect of Tyler&#x27;s slyness lies in her ability to write sentences that seem to present no resistance, that are perfectly clear in their direction, that don&#x27;t send up metaphorical gestures by way of suggesting the inexpressibility of life. Yet such writing is beautifully accurate, more often than not with a glinting vein of humor. ...Tyler&#x27;s grip on her characters and their pathos is similarly mischievous, but its focus is steady and unerring. The book also touches levels deeper than mischief...to spend the last third of the novel demonstrating (as one of the chapter titles has it) that &quot;The World Won&#x27;t End.&quot; Tragedy ends after the big mistake has been made and paid for, but comedy goes on its way, devoted to showing how everyone is necessarily mistaken.&quot;

<doc id="1120930" wikidata="Q913267" url="?curid=1120930" title="Grettis saga">
<text>Grettis saga Ásmundarsonar ( , ), also known as &quot;Grettla&quot;, &quot;Grettir&#x27;s Saga&quot; or &quot;The Saga of Grettir the Strong&quot;, is one of the Icelanders&#x27; sagas. It details the life of Grettir Ásmundarson, a bellicose Icelandic outlaw, and is set in the eleventh century.

== Overview ==
&quot;Grettis saga&quot; is considered one of the Sagas of Icelanders (&quot;Íslendingasögur&quot;), which were written down in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and record stories of events that supposedly took place between the ninth and the eleventh centuries in Iceland. The earliest manuscript of &quot;Grettis saga&quot; was written down some time just before 1400 AD, and the saga is thought to have been composed in its current form in the fourteenth century, making it a relatively late addition to the genre.

The author is unknown but it is believed that the saga may have been based on a previous account of Grettir&#x27;s life written by Sturla Þórðarson. Whoever the author was, the author shows an awareness of the Sagas of Icelanders tradition by making references to other sagas and borrowing themes from the larger cultural milieu of the Germanic peoples that appear independently in other texts like the Old English &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

The saga can be split into three major sections: Chapters 1-13, Chapters 14-85, and Chapters 86-93. The first and last sections of the saga focus on Grettir&#x27;s family rather than on Grettir.

Chapters 1-13 primarily focus on how Grettir&#x27;s viking great-grandfather Onundur Tree-foot escaped Norway to settle in Iceland after fighting in the Battle of Hafrsfjord against the first king of Norway Harald Fairhair. Chapters 14-85 primarily focus on the life, condemnation, and death of Grettir. Chapters 86-93 focus on Grettir&#x27;s half-brother Thorstein Dromund&#x27;s journey to the court of Constantinople to take revenge and, incidentally, find courtly love before spending the latter portion of his life in a monastic cell in Rome.

Both Grettir&#x27;s viking/raider great-grandfather and his chivalry-practicing half-brother succeed whereas Grettir&#x27;s quest to become a monster-slaying hero of old results in him becoming an outlaw. Christianity became the religion in Iceland around 1000 CE, and some scholars believe this changing morality explains why Grettir&#x27;s fate is different than his pagan great-grandfather&#x27;s before conversion and his pious, Christian half-brother&#x27;s fate after conversion.

Originally, the ill-tempered Grettir experienced some success, but his life takes a turn for the worse after he encounters the undead shepherd Glámr in chapter 35. As a result of Glámr&#x27;s curse, Grettir becomes disastrously unlucky, only grows weaker/never stronger, becomes afraid of the dark, and is doomed to loneliness, becoming an outlaw, and an early death. While in Norway in chapter 38, Grettir accidentally sets fire to a hut, killing its occupants. In chapter 46, the Althing back in the Icelandic Commonwealth votes that Grettir is an outlaw because of the deaths this fire caused. This outlaw status forces Grettir to live on the edge of society and opens him up to being hunted by others. He is repeatedly betrayed by other outlaws and, after living 19 years as an outlaw, he will die a hunted man on the lonely island of Drangey in chapter 82. In chapter 77, it is stated that Grettir would have ceased being an outlaw after 20 years.

== Summary ==

===Chapters 1–13===

Chapters 1–13 take place before Grettir&#x27;s birth and focus on his father, Ásmundar, his grandfather, Thorgrim Grey-head, and his great-grandfather Önundur. Grettir&#x27;s great-grandfather Önundur had been a viking/raider. In chapter two, Önundur lost his leg below the knee and became Önundur Tree-foot, while fighting from a ship against the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord. King Harald won the battle and united Norway into one kingdom. In chapter 3, those who fought King Harald fled Norway for Britain and Ireland. At one point, Önundur Tree-leg fought a battle against Kjarval, who was king around Dublin. In chapter 7, Önundur tree-foot visits southern Norway to assist kin. In chapter 8, he leaves Norway and arrives in Iceland to settle for good in chapter 9. Önundur dies and is buried in tumulus in chapter 11, after which the saga&#x27;s focus shifts to his son Thorgrim Grey-head and his son Ásmundar Grey-hair. Asmundar fathers Thorstein Dromund while visiting Norway in Chapter 13 and then returns to Iceland.

===Chapters 14–85===

Grettir&#x27;s life is told from beginning to end. Chapter 14 describes Grettir&#x27;s immediate family. Ásmundar Grey-hair and his wife Asdis have two boys: (1) the eldest brother, Atli, is quiet and gentle, and (2) Grettir, is rebellious, bad-tempered, and mischievous. He is described as red haired, somewhat freckled, and broad around the eyes. They also have two daughters: (3) Thordis and (4) Rannveig. In this chapter, it is stated the Grettir&#x27;s father did not care for him much but that his mother loved him a lot. It is also revealed that Grettir grew strong and that he has a fondness for poetry.

In chapter 16, Grettir receives his first sentence for outlawry.
While still very young, Grettir kills a person because he thinks they have taken his food bag. Despite attempts to pay compensation to the family similar to weregild, he is temporarily banished from Iceland and sentenced to lesser-outlawry for three years. He asks his father for a sword before he leaves, which his father refuses, but his mother Asdis gives him a family heirloom sword from her family line in chapter 17. He then leaves for Norway for the first time.

In chapter 18, Grettir fights his first creature, a reanimated undead or &quot;draugr&quot; of the man named Kárr inn gamli (Kar the Old). Kárr was there guarding treasure in his own funeral mound/tumulus from looters. Grettir triumphs using the sword Jökulsnautr (‘Jokul&#x27;s Gift’, presumably passed down from his maternal great-grandfather Jökull Ingimundarson, son of Ingimundr Þorsteinsson who figure in the &quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot;). Treasures are taken from the mound after Grettir&#x27;s triumph, including an heirloom sword, presumably Kársnautr (‘Karr&#x27;s-loom’). He has other successful adventures in Norway as well, killing bears and berserkers. He then has to flee Norway to go back to Iceland after he kills people for an insult in chapters 23 and 24.

Grettir comes back to Iceland. In Chapters 32-33 a farmer named Thorhall is losing shepherds, as his pasture is haunted by a wight. On the advice of a local elder named Skapti, Thorhall hires a Swedish shepherd named Glámr, hoping that the shepherd&#x27;s extraordinary strength and size will allow him to defy the wight. At first, Glámr is successful, but after refusing to fast on Yule-tide, he is found dead in the snow, having driven the evil creature away at the cost of his own life. The villagers attempt to move Glámr to the church for burial but are unable to, and he is buried where he lies. Not long after, Glámr himself rises as a revenant and begins haunting the area.

In Chapter 35, Grettir fights and destroys Glámr, but the revenant uses his last breath to lay a curse on him. Glámr&#x27;s curse is what leads Grettir in a different direction. As a result of Glámr&#x27;s curse, Grettir becomes disastrously unlucky, only grows weaker/never stronger, becomes afraid of the dark, and is doomed to loneliness, becoming an outlaw, and an early death.

While in Norway for the second time in chapter 38, Grettir will accidentally kill a hut full of people by unintentionally lighting it on fire. His older brother, Atli at the family farm will get killed by a man named Thorbjorn in chapter 45. In chapter 46, the Althing back in the Icelandic Commonwealth votes that Grettir is an outlaw because of the deaths the fire caused. Grettir returns home to Iceland the following chapter, 47, to learn this information for the first time. This outlaw status forces Grettir to live on the edge of society and opens him up to being hunted by others and being betrayed by other outlaws.

Grettir lives in various places running from enemies and slaying more monsters. In Chapter 69 he returns home to the farm at Bjarg and sees his mother. She sends him off with his 15 year old brother Illugi and they head off to spend the rest of the saga on the island of Drangey off the northern tip of Iceland. Part of the reason for this if that the island has steep cliffs and can only be climbed up on with the help of a ladder than can be withdrawn. Grettir eventually becomes the longest-surviving outlaw in Icelandic history. After spending over 19 years as an outlaw, his friends and family ask for his banishment to be lifted, arguing that a man could not spend more than 20 years as an outlaw according to the law (in fact, there was no such law in medieval Iceland). In chapter 77, after a debate at the assembly, it is decided that the outlawry will be lifted when he has completed the 20 years but not before. His enemies make one last effort, using sorcery to cause him to wound himself and finally defeat him, atop the cliff-sided, lonely, fortress-like Drangey off the northern tip of Iceland where he was staying with another brother of his named Illugi, and his slave Glaumur. Grettir&#x27;s enemies succeed in killing him in chapter 82. Assuming that the tales of the saga bear any relationship to historical realities, Grettir would have died &#x27;some time between 1030 and 1040&#x27;.

===Chapters 86–93===

His half-brother, Thorsteinn Dromund, later avenges him in a semi-comic scene in Byzantium/Constantinople, where the Norse served as Varangians. While in Constantinople, he falls in love with a married woman named Spes, who helps him. After Thorsteinn Dromund completes his mission the two of them decide to spend the rest of their lives in monastic cells in Rome.

==Legacy==
===Place-names===
Grettir Ásmundarson was reported to have been from Bjarg in Miðfjörður. At Bjarg, Grettir Ásmundarson always had refuge with his mother Ásdís. Many place names in the neighbourhood of Bjarg and indeed throughout the county bear the name of the outlaw e.g. Grettishaf, Grettistak and Grettishöfði at Arnarvatn.

=== &quot;Grettisfærsla&quot; ===
The late fifteenth-century manuscript Eggertsbók contains the sole surviving text of &quot;Grettisfærsla&quot;, a poem concerning a character called Grettir which is mentioned in chapter 52 of &quot;Grettis saga&quot;. The poem is notable for its thematic focus on sex and the &quot;indiscriminate sexuality&quot; of its protagonist with both men and women, and even animals, expressed in direct, non-euphemistic language.&quot;&quot;

===&quot;Rímur&quot;===
&quot;Grettis saga&quot; inspired a number of Icelandic &quot;rímur&quot;:
15th century: &quot;Grettis rímur&quot; (8 rímur, anonymous, attested in Kollsbók)
1656: &quot;Grettis rímur&quot; (14 &quot;rímur&quot;, Jón Guðmundsson í Rauðseyjum)
1658: &quot;Grettis rímur&quot; (20 &quot;rímur&quot;, Kolbeinn Grímsson)
17th century: &quot;Grettis rímur&quot; (lost, Jón Guðmundsson í Hellu)
1828: &quot;Grettis rímur&quot; (44 &quot;rímur&quot;, Magnús Jónsson í Magnússkógum)
1889: &quot;Ríma um síðasta fund Grettis Ásmundssonar og móður hans, Ásdísar á Bjargi&quot; (1 &quot;ríma&quot;, Oddur Jónsson)
1930: &quot;Gláms rímur&quot; (6 &quot;rímur&quot; and epilogue, Sigfús Sigfússon )

===Post-1900 culture===
Garfield is named Grettir in Iceland, because he is rufous, a little broad and unwilling to conform to society&#x27;s norms. A memorial was erected to his mother Ásdís at Bjarg in 1974. The memorial displays a relief from &quot;Grettis saga&quot; made by Icelandic artist Halldór Pétursson.

Grettir is celebrated in the long poem &quot;Eclogue from Iceland&quot; in the 1938 collection &quot;The Earth Compels&quot; by Irish poet Louis MacNeice, who had developed a love of Norse mythology while at school at Marlborough College. In it, the ghost of Grettir speaks with two men, Craven and Ryan, who have been &#x27;hounded&#x27; from a decadent and war-threatened Europe &#x27;whose voice calls in the sirens of destroyers&#x27;. He urges them to recover their underlying human values, and to assert, as he has, &#x27;the sanctity of the individual will&#x27;. He tells them to return home as an act of duty, which he calls - remembering his own defiant choice to be an outlaw - &#x27;Your hazard, your act of defiance and hymn of hate, hatred of hatred, assertion of human values&#x27; and (in the poem&#x27;s final words&#x27;) &#x27;your only chance&#x27;.

The Australian composer Percy Grainger described the Grettis Saga as the &quot;strongest single artistic influence&quot; in his life.

The saga was adapted in 2017 as the basis for a novel set in Sheffield by Tony Williams.

&quot;Grettir’s last stand at Drangey&quot; is mentioned in John K. Samson&#x27;s 2011 song &quot;Letter in Icelandic from the Ninette San&quot;.

<doc id="1120932" wikidata="Q1090583" url="?curid=1120932" title="Château Latour">
<text>Château Latour is a French wine estate, rated as a First Growth under the 1855 Bordeaux Classification. Latour lies at the very southeastern tip of the commune of Pauillac in the Médoc region to the north-west of Bordeaux, at its border with Saint-Julien, and only a few hundred metres from the banks of the Gironde estuary.

The estate produces three red wines in all. In addition to its &quot;Grand vin&quot; (LWIN 1012316), Latour has also produced the second wine Les Forts de Latour (LWIN 1010309) since 1966, and a third wine, simply named Pauillac (LWIN 1013821), has been released every year since 1989. An &quot;impériale&quot; (six-litre bottle) of 1961 Château Latour sold for £135,000 in 2011.

==History==
The site has been occupied since at least 1331 when Tor à Saint-Lambert was built by Gaucelme de Castillon, and the estate dating to at least 1378. A garrison fort was built 300 metres from the estuary to guard against attack during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The tower, the name mutating with time to La Tour en Saint-Mambert and Saint-Maubert, gave its name to the estate around the fortress and was in English hands until the Battle of Castillon in 1453, and its complete destruction by the forces of the King of France. The original tower no longer exists, but in the 1620s a circular tower (La Tour de Saint-Lambert) was built on the estate named after Simon Ledwidge and though it is actually designed as a pigeon roost, it remains a strong symbol of the vineyard. Though two centuries apart, this building is said to have been constructed using the original edifice.

Vines have existed on the site since the 14th century, and Latour&#x27;s wine received some early recognition, discussed as early as in the 16th century in &quot;Essays&quot; by Montaigne. Near the end of the 16th century, the estate&#x27;s several smallholdings had been accumulated by the de Mullet family into one property.

From 1670 began a lineage of connected family ownership not broken until 1963, when the estate was acquired by the de Chavannes family, and passed by marriage to the de Clauzel family in 1677. When Alexandre de Ségur married Marie-Thérèse de Clauzel, Latour became a part of his vast property, to which he also added Château Lafite in 1716, just prior to his death. In 1718 his son Nicolas-Alexandre de Ségur added Château Mouton and Château Calon-Ségur to his holdings and began producing wines of great quality. The widespread reputation of Latour emerged at the beginning of the 18th century when its status was established on export markets such as England, alongside chateaux Lafite, Margaux and Pontac.

With the death of Nicolas-Alexandre Ségur in 1755 the estate was divided among four daughters, three of whom inherited Latour in 1760, and with absent landlords, Latour was managed by a &quot;regisseur&quot; charged with efficient administration and thorough correspondence with the owners. Receiving more care than under the late owner whose favourite had been Lafite, Latour improved in the later half of the century, and later became a favourite of Thomas Jefferson, then minister to France, when he categorised La Tour de Ségur as a vineyard of first quality in 1787.

With the onset of the French Revolution, the property became divided. The Comte de Ségur-Cabanac fled France and his portion was auctioned off by the state in 1794, passing through several owners. The estate was not reunited until 1841, when the family succeeded in a plot to put the estate up for sale, and eventually emerged after an auction having regained the 20% shares owned by &quot;négociants&quot; Barton, Guestier and Johnston. The &quot;Société Civile de Château Latour&quot; was formed in 1842, exclusive to the family, who then had become shareholders.

Ahead of the International Exhibition in Paris, the selection of Latour as one of the four First Growths in the Classification of 1855 consolidated its reputation, and ensured its high prices. The present château was completed in 1864.

===Modern history===
In 1963 the estate finally left the Ségur family, then named de Beaumont, when the heirs sold three-quarters of the Château Latour shares to the British interests of the Pearson Group under control of Lord Cowdray, with shares owned by Harvey&#x27;s of Bristol. Henri Martin and Jean-Paul Gardère were appointed as managers which brought about substantial innovations. Investments were made in research, vineyards were expanded by acquisition and replanting, the &quot;chai&quot; was extended and Latour became the first of the first growths to modernise their whole production, replacing the old oak fermenting vats with stainless steel temperature-controlled vats. The second wine with fruit from younger vines was initiated, and fruit for the &quot;grand vin&quot; was decided to come exclusively from the vineyards shown on the plan of the domain from 1759. Martin and Gardère formally resigned from the Conseil d&#x27;Administration in 1987, ending a 24-year era.

In 1989 Latour was purchased by Allied Lyons for around £110 million, but in 1993 returned to French ownership when bought by businessman François Pinault for £86 million when it became part of his holding company Groupe Artemis.

In December 2008 it was reported that the investment bank Lazard was offering the estate for sale. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; speculated that among the interested parties were wine mogul Bernard Magrez, with actors Gérard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, in a transaction which would bring one of the five first growths under the control of a resident Bordelais for the first time in several decades.

==Production==
The estate has of vineyard, of which a portion near the château is named l&#x27;Enclos, where fruit exclusive to the &quot;grand vin&quot; is grown. The composition of grape varieties is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and 2% of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

The &quot;grand vin&quot; Chateau Latour, typically a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, with the remainder Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, normally has an annual production of 18,000 cases. The second wine Les Forts de Latour, typically 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, has an average annual production of 11,000 cases. Beginning in 1989, the estate began producing a third wine, Pauillac de Latour.

== Price ==
The estate&#x27;s &quot;grand vin&quot; is one of the most expensive Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot wines made in the Médoc region and retails at an average price of $793 for a 750 ml bottle.

<text>ORP &quot;Grom&quot; was the lead ship of her class of destroyers serving in the Polish Navy during World War II. She was named after the Polish word for Thunder or Thunderbolt, while her sister ship translates to lightning bolt.

==Design==
&quot;Grom&quot; was thought of as a large destroyer, similar to flotilla leaders. She and sister ship ORP &quot;Błyskawica&quot; were to support the outdated French-built and in the role of the core of the Polish Navy in a possible conflict. As Poland had only one major seaport, the main task of the Polish naval forces was to secure supplies shipment to and from allied countries. Because of that, the &quot;Grom&quot; class was designed to fulfill both the role of shore defence and convoy escort and was supposed to be stronger than single enemy destroyers.

Two Parsons steam turbines of altogether, three boilers and two shafts allowed &quot;Grom&quot; to travel at , faster than the contemporary designs like the US and es, the British , or the German s. Also, as it was not clear whether the ships would be used to secure convoys to the Polish port of Gdynia or the Romanian port of Constanţa (through the Romanian Bridgehead), the possible range was much larger than in the case of destroyers designed exclusively for the Baltic Sea. The ship had an effective range of at .

==Construction and career==
&quot;Grom&quot; was ordered from the British J. Samuel White shipyard in Cowes and was laid down in 1935. The destroyer was commissioned in 1937.

The commanders of the ship were:
* Lieutenant Commander Stanisław Hryniewiecki - January 25, 1937 - June 20, 1938
* Commander Aleksander Hulewicz - March 13 or. June 20, 1938 - May 4, 1940

On 30 August 1939, the Polish destroyers , , and &quot;Grom&quot; were ordered to activate the Peking Plan, and the warships headed for Great Britain, from where they were to operate as convoy escorts. On 1 September 1939, Polish destroyers met with the British destroyers and . The British ships led the Polish flotilla to Leith, and in the night the Polish destroyers came to Rosyth.

During her operations in the Norwegian Campaign, &quot;Grom&quot; was ranked by the German soldiers as probably the most hated of all the Allied ships deployed to the area. This hatred was founded on the fact that &quot;Grom&quot; took an intense interest in all hostile movements on shore and was reputed to spend hours lurking the coast in order to harass German forces. On 4 May 1940, &quot;Grom&quot; carried out what turned out to be the last of her many naval gunfire support missions in the Narvik area in the Rombaken fjord. She was attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Kampfgeschwader 100 (piloted by Lt. Korthals). &quot;Grom&quot; was hit by two bombs and sank after internal explosion.

The wreck was never raised and it was not until 6 October 1986 that it was explored by divers for the first time.

==War memorial==

A war memorial for Polish soldiers and sailors who fell during the Battles of Narvik was erected in 1979 on the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war. The memorial is located in &quot;Groms plass&quot; in Narvik, a park named after &quot;Grom&quot;.

<text>Jacques Ozanam (16 June 1640, in Sainte-Olive, Ain – 3 April 1718, in Paris) was a French mathematician.

==Biography==

Jacques Ozanam was born in Sainte-Olive, Ain, France.

In 1670, he published trigonometric and logarithmic tables more accurate than the existing ones of Ulacq, Pitiscus, and Briggs. An act of kindness in lending money to two strangers brought him to the attention of M. d&#x27;Aguesseau, father of the chancellor, and he secured an invitation to settle in Paris. There he enjoyed prosperity and contentment for many years. He married, had a large family, and derived an ample income from teaching mathematics to private pupils, chiefly foreigners.

His mathematical publications were numerous and well received. &quot;Récréations&quot; (published 1694) was later translated into English and is well known today. He was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1701. The death of his wife plunged him into deep sorrow, and the loss of his foreign pupils through the War of the Spanish Succession reduced him to poverty. He died in Paris on April 3, 1718 (frequently cited as 1717 because of an error in &quot;éloge de Fontenelle&quot;).

Ozanam was honoured more abroad than at home. He was devout, charitable, courageous, and of simple faith. As a young man he had overcome a passion for gambling. He was wont to say that it was for the doctors of the Sorbonne to dispute, for the pope to decide, and for a mathematician to go to heaven in a perpendicular line.

He taught Abraham de Moivre.

<doc id="1120962" wikidata="Q3042524" url="?curid=1120962" title="Mega Man Zero 3">
<text>Mega Man Zero 3 is a 2004 action-platform game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the third video game in the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series of &quot;Mega Man&quot; video games. The European version featured a completely different logo, which was also used on various other &quot;Mega Man&quot; titles.

The game takes place two months after the events of &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; and follows series protagonist Zero as he attempts to stop a new villain, Dr. Weil, from wreaking havoc on Neo Arcadia.

&quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its combat, level design, and story, although some criticized its similarities to previous titles. In February 2020, the game was released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam as part of the &quot;Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot;.

== Plot ==
Two months following Zero&#x27;s victory over Elpizo, the Dark Elf remains at large. During this time, Ciel has finished her research on a new energy supply to end the crisis, dubbed the &quot;Ciel System&quot;. While en route to Neo Arcadia to propose the Ciel System in hopes of ending the conflict and the genocide of Reploids, a spaceship with the Dark Elf&#x27;s energy reading crashes to Earth.

Zero sets out to investigate, but instead finds the remaining Guardians (Harpuia, Fefnir, and Leviathan) fighting against a gigantic Reploid named Omega and a scientist named Dr. Weil — both who were banished to space due to their crimes in instigating the Elf Wars and turning the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf a century prior. Dr. Weil reveals he has resurrected Copy X, who resumes his rule over Neo Arcadia, much to Harpuia&#x27;s chagrin. The Guardians, suspecting that Copy X is being heavily influenced by Dr. Weil, defect from Neo Arcadia. Zero and Dr. Weil go their separate ways in search of the Dark Elf.

The Dark Elf appears in a human residential district in Neo Arcadia, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to launch a missile in order to incapacitate it. Although successful in capturing the Dark Elf, the incident kills thousands of humans. Following this event, Ciel rescinds her offer of the Ciel System, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to brand the Resistance as Mavericks and subsequently launch an invasion against them. The Resistance is able to delay the invasion until Zero locates Copy X. During the ensuing battle, Copy X is betrayed and killed by Dr. Weil, who declares himself the new ruler of Neo Arcadia and announces his true intention for capturing the Dark Elf: to fuse it with Omega and link them with a frequency transmitter that would enable Omega to control the minds of every Reploid on Earth.

Zero confronts and defeats Omega, who reveals his true form: a body that looks exactly like Zero. Dr. Weil reveals that while Zero was powered down during his 100-year hibernation, he had transferred Zero&#x27;s conscience and memories to a copy body and stole Zero&#x27;s original body to be used by Omega due to its unmatched fighting abilities. Despite this revelation, Zero and the Guardians destroy his original body, killing Omega for good. Omega&#x27;s death results in a massive explosion, which frees the Dark Elf from Dr. Weil&#x27;s corruption, However, Harpuia, Fefnir, and Leviathan&#x27;s fate is unknown due to different sources stating that they survived while others say they perished.

While Zero is unconscious, X appears and tells Zero that it&#x27;s up to him to protect the Earth and defeat Dr. Weil. Finally out of power, X vanishes forever. The Dark Elf, known as the Mother Elf once more, delivers Zero to the Resistance Base before flying away.

== Gameplay ==
This game follows almost exactly the same rules as its predecessor, &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot;. Once again, Zero has his Z-Saber, Buster, and Shield Boomerang. However, Zero&#x27;s rod weapon (originally the Triple Rod in &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; and the Chain Rod in &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot;) has been replaced with the Recoil Rod: a pair of tonfa-like weapons that can be aimed in all directions. When charged up, a powerful stabbing attack is performed, which can knock enemies back, or propel Zero into the air if aimed down to the ground, like a makeshift pogo stick.

The Cyber Elf system has been given an overhaul with the introduction of Satellite Cyber Elves. These are different from the standard Cyber Elves, which have been renamed &quot;Fusion Elves&quot;, in that they are equipped for a constant benefit, and the use of them will not affect the mission ranking score. However, only two Satellite Elves can be equipped at once.

Cyberspace is a new addition to the game. It is said by one Resistance Member (Hirondelle) that the portal to Cyberspace opened up due to Omega&#x27;s arrival. Going through the door to Cyberspace leads the player into an area that looks exactly like the one in which they left but with a green tinge to it. Enemy appearances are less frequent and if a transfer of info from a &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 4&quot;/&quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; link has been performed, certain virus enemies from the Battle Network Series will appear. All enemies drop health items (instead of other items, such as Secret Disks) in Cyberspace. Entering the Cyberspace causes certain Cyber Elves (both Fusion and Satellite, the ones with the A-mark on the lower left) to auto-activate without dying, even if not grown enough to be normally used, and these Elves do not affect the score. However, going into Cyberspace decreases the mission ranking score, making it more difficult to obtain an S or A Rank, which is needed in order to win EX Skills of the end-of-stage bosses. Zero no longer needs to &quot;level up&quot; in order to create weapon combos as they are already in place.

=== Secret Disks ===
Throughout the game, enemies may drop Secret Disks, which may contain information about the Mega Man Zero series, enemy information, Cyber Elves, energy capsules, energy crystals or even customization chips.

Most of the disks can be opened by Zero himself, mostly those containing Cyber Elves, but the others are locked and the player will have to take them to Cerveau in order to open them. Once opened, their info will be stored in a Secret Disk library featured within the game.

=== Customization Chips ===
The Forms system from &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; has been replaced with Customization Chips. These can be found in Secret Disks and come in three types—head, body and legs. Only one of each type of chip can be equipped at a time, which gives the player more flexibility in customizing Zero.

These Chips give direct upgrades to Zero&#x27;s head, body or legs, and can be used to reproduce the effects of the various Forms that Zero could take in &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot;. As with the Forms in this game&#x27;s predecessor, Zero can take on different colours when different body chips are equipped.

=== Extras ===
As with other Mega Man Zero games, beating the game will allow playing the completed save file again in a &quot;New Game+&quot;. Zero will start with all Fusion Elves used from the previous game still in effect (although he will still be penalized for their use), and will also get to keep any EX Skills and body chips that he earned in the previous game.

Hard Mode can be unlocked after completing the game once. It can be accessed by pressing the L shoulder button before pressing Start while selecting a New Game. In Hard Mode, Cyber Elves cannot be used and Cyberspace cannot be accessed (save for one specific level). Zero&#x27;s triple-slash and full-charge shot are also disabled, and he cannot earn EX Skills.

Ultimate mode can be unlocked by collecting all of the Secret Disks in one game and beating it. Hold R when starting a New Game to play. In Ultimate Mode, Zero starts with all Fusion Elves with permanent effects (such as the Elves that extend the life meter) already in use and without penalty in mission scores. Zero will also have a few body parts available from the start, including the Ultima Foot chip. Finally, Zero can use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos.

There are also seven mini games that can be selected from on the game&#x27;s Start Menu. They are all unlocked after certain criteria have been met:

* Zero mini-game – Beat the game once.
* Copy X mini-game – Beat the game on Hard Mode.
* Ciel mini-game – Beat the game with an overall S-rank at the final stage.
* Fefnir mini-game – Beat the game with an average of 100 points at the final stage.
* Leviathan mini-game – Beat the game with an average of 100 points at the final stage.
* Phantom mini-game – Beat the game without attacking with any weapons other than the Buster Shot (you can still use them, just don&#x27;t hit any enemies with them; e.g. You can still use Recoil Rod for pushing blocks or the jump boost, for example), and with an overall S-Rank.
* Harpuia mini-game – Beat the game without attacking with any weapons other than the Z-Saber (you can still use them, just don&#x27;t hit any enemies with them; e.g. You can still use Recoil Rod for pushing blocks or the jump boost, for example), and with an overall S-Rank.

In addition, the Japanese version also uses the Nintendo e-Reader system to unlock gameplay features which are adjustments by scanning the cards to unlock visual changes in the Resistance Base or minor power-ups. In the later &quot;Zero Collection&quot; and &quot;Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot; this has been changed to an unlockable feature that each require different aspects of the collections to be completed, which also allowed this feature to become available outside of Japan.

== Reception ==
&quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; was the fourth best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release. It was the 106th best-selling game in the country for 2004 at 121,847 units sold. The game would later become one of the cheapest game of the Mega Man Zero subseries to repurchase.

A common comment made by reviews of the game is that &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; is similar to its predecessors and has not changed much in terms of gameplay. Reviewers complain often about the difficulty level of this game&#x27;s predecessors and were quick to praise the game&#x27;s difficulty level for being more forgiving but still challenging. 

For instance, Gamespot said the game &quot;could be considered the best of the GBA Mega Man games&quot;, enjoying Zero&#x27;s increased arsenal and more forgiving gameplay. Game Informer critiqued that &quot;this game is too much of the same, and virtually inaccessible to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to memorize every inch of it&quot;

<text>Stereo MC&#x27;s are an English hip hop and electronic dance group that formed in Clapham, London, England, in 1985. They had an international top 20 hit with their single &quot;Connected&quot; and a UK top 20 hit with &quot;Step It Up&quot;. After releasing eight albums for Island Records, K7, Graffiti Recordings, and Pias, they formed the label Connected with the band Terranova to release their own material and that of other artists within the house/techno/electronic genre.

==Career==

Rob Birch (vocalist/songwriter) and Nick Hallam (DJ/producer) co-founded the Gee Street recording studio and record label, in 1985 along with Jon Baker and DJ Richie Rich. Part of the finance came from Birch and Hallam&#x27;s joint receipt of £14,000 from a property developer, on condition they vacated their adjacent flats.

When Gee Street attracted the attention of 4th &amp; Broadway, they recorded the debut Stereo MCs&#x27; studio album, &quot;33-45-78&quot; (1989), on a shoestring budget with DJ Cesare. Drummer Owen If and backing vocalist Cath Coffey joined the group for the &quot;Supernatural LP&quot;. In 1990, &quot;Elevate My Mind&quot; was the first British hip hop single to reach the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Having supported the Happy Mondays on a US tour, in the emerging UK alternative dance scene, it took an alliance with the Jungle Brothers to ensure chart success for &quot;Supernatural&quot; (1990). Remix work for U2 and Queen Latifah followed.

Their live band included singers Andrea Bedassie and Verona Davis, and they were one of the few hip hop outfits to play at rock music festivals at the time. 1992&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough &quot;Connected&quot;, a number 2 success in the UK Albums Chart, contained the hit singles &quot;Connected&quot;, &quot;Step It Up&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot;, and &quot;Ground Level&quot;, and won them 1994 Brit Awards for Best Group and Best Album. Hallam and Birch then created the music-publishing firm Spirit Songs, which signed Finley Quaye.

However, the follow-up to &quot;Connected&quot; did not appear for almost a decade. Further remix duties for Madonna (&quot;Frozen&quot;), Tricky (&quot;Makes Me Wanna Die&quot; Weekend Mix), and the Jungle Brothers (&quot;Jungle Brother&quot;) in 1998 kept the Stereo MCs&#x27; name in the limelight. Madonna went on to use the &quot;Frozen&quot; remix on her 2001 Drowned World Tour.

In 2000, they released a Disc Jockey mix for Studio !K7&#x27;s DJ-Kicks series and remixed another song for Madonna (&quot;Music&quot;). The following year saw the release of &quot;Deep Down &amp; Dirty&quot;, followed by a tour including slots opening for the recently re-united Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

Their sixth studio album, &quot;Double Bubble&quot;, was released in July 2008, followed by their seventh, &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Nightingale&quot;, in August 2011. In December 2008, they supported Madness at the O2 Arena in London.
Drummer Owen If died on 10 July 2022, at the age of 63.

<text>Kornigou, also known as kornik, are unsweetened pastries made of wheat flour formed in a triangular shape reminiscent of a mitre or square cap, possibly in the style of the first bishop of Cornouaille, a historic province of Brittany. It was not a popular dessert; by 1880, it was only sold by two bakers in Guilers on the feast day of St Corentin. The kornigou were possibly shaped in the style of St Corentin&#x27;s hair.

<doc id="1120992" wikidata="Q1033241" url="?curid=1120992" title="Mohawk Trail">
<text>The Mohawk Trail began as a Native American trade route which connected Atlantic tribes with tribes in Upstate New York and beyond. It followed the Millers River, Deerfield River and crossed the Hoosac Range, in the area that is now northwestern Massachusetts.

== Route ==
Today the Mohawk Trail is a part of Routes 2 and 2A, following much of the original Indian trail. The exact path of the trail is not officially defined, and there is some disagreement among various sources as to its endpoints. The broadest definition runs 75 miles (121 kilometers) from Athol, Massachusetts to the border with New York in Williamstown, Massachusetts, passing through the communities of Orange, Erving, Gill, Greenfield, Shelburne, Buckland, Charlemont, Savoy, Florida, and North Adams. However, other sources use a narrower definition, with the eastern terminus being in Millers Falls, Greenfield, or Charlemont. The trail is generally considered to follow Route 2A in the east (which diverges from Route 2 as it goes through the town centers of Athol, Orange, and Greenfield) and continue on Route 2 after Route 2A ends in Greenfield.

== Attractions ==
The modern day Mohawk Trail is considered one of the most beautiful drives in Massachusetts. The Berkshire mountains are clearly visible from several points. There are numerous points of interest along the way, including many scenic viewpoints, roadside attractions and gift shops. Of particular note is Hail to the Sunrise at Mohawk Park, a statue made in tribute to Native American heritage. A portion of the trail parallels the Deerfield River for several miles, and passes through the village of Shelburne Falls, and the Bridge of Flowers. The route crosses the Connecticut River via the historic French King Bridge at a height of 140 feet. The road reaches a high elevation of 2272 feet at Whitcomb Summit. On the western side of the summit there is the popular hairpin turn and lookout, overlooking the city of North Adams and the Taconic Mountains. On the eastern side, the highway descends steeply eastward from Whitcomb Summit down the slope of the Hoosac Range following the Cold River to the Deerfield River. Notable features include the infamous Dead Man&#x27;s Curve.

A six-mile section of the Mohawk Trail was severely damaged by Hurricane Irene in August 2011. A considerable portion of the road is surrounded by the Mohawk Trail State Forest, a forest, known for its camping, and occasional encounters with bobcats and black bears. Within this area there is substantial acreage of old growth forest containing many of the tallest trees in Massachusetts as verified by the Eastern Native Tree Society.
The route passes close to Vermont&#x27;s southern border, and alternate routes travel north into Vermont to Harriman Reservoir and Ball Mountain State Park. The western terminus in Williamstown provides access to Mount Greylock, U.S. Route 7, and New York State Route 2.

A portion of the historic footpath route, running through Florida, Savoy, and Charlemont, from the confluence of the Cold and Deerfield Rivers up the Cold River valley to Wheeler Brook, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 1973. This route, where the footpath itself is no longer extant in original form, is located on the north bank of the Cold River, with the modern roadway running along the south bank included in the listed area as an intrusion on the setting.

<text>Shalamar () is an American R&amp;B and soul music vocal group created by Dick Griffey and Don Cornelius in 1977 and active throughout the 1980s. Shalamar&#x27;s classic lineup on the SOLAR label consisted of Howard Hewett, Jody Watley, and Jeffrey Daniel. It was originally a disco-driven group created by &quot;Soul Train&quot; booking agent Dick Griffey and show creator and producer Don Cornelius. They went on to be an influential dance trio, masterminded by Cornelius. As noted in the &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, they were regarded as fashion icons and trendsetters, and helped to introduce &quot;body-popping&quot; to the United Kingdom. Their name was created by Griffey.

==Career==

The first hit credited to Shalamar was &quot;Uptown Festival&quot; (1977), which was recorded at Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s studio Bolic Sound in 1976. It was released on Soul Train Records. Its success inspired Griffey and Don Cornelius to replace session singers with popular &quot;Soul Train&quot; dancers Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, to join original Shalamar lead singer Gary Mumford. Gerald Brown took over the spot vacated by Mumford for the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Disco Gardens&quot; (1978), which featured the hit &quot;Take That to the Bank&quot;. After conflicts over lack of payment from Griffey and SOLAR (short for Sound of Los Angeles Records), Brown left the group. Howard Hewett replaced Brown in 1979. The group was joined up with producer Leon Sylvers III in 1979, signed with SOLAR, and scored a US million seller with &quot;The Second Time Around&quot; (1979). The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Hewett, Watley and Daniel would be the most successful.
In the UK, the group had a string of hits with songs such as &quot;Take That to the Bank&quot; (1978), &quot;I Owe You One&quot; (1980), and songs from the Platinum-certified &quot;Friends&quot; (1982) album: &quot;I Can Make You Feel Good&quot; (1982), &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, the BPI Silver-certified &quot;There It Is&quot;, and the title track &quot;Friends&quot;. The album, which crossed the genres of pop, disco, and soul, was also a big seller in the UK in 1982. The band&#x27;s record sales in the UK increased when Daniel demonstrated his body-popping dancing skills on BBC Television&#x27;s music programme, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, which had premiered the moonwalk on television for the first time. Michael Jackson was a fan of Shalamar, particularly Daniel and his dance moves, after watching him on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Jackson and Daniel met afterward, and Jackson took his then 12-year-old sister Janet to see Shalamar perform at Disneyland. Daniel and Jackson co-choreographed Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; videos from the album &quot;Bad&quot; (1987).
The Hewett-Watley-Daniel lineup of Shalamar scored a total of three Gold albums in the U.S.: &quot;Big Fun&quot; (1979), &quot;Three for Love&quot; (1980) and &quot;Friends&quot; (1982). In 1983, prior to the release of &quot;The Look&quot;, Watley and Daniel left Shalamar due to conflicts within the group as well as issues with Dick Griffey and SOLAR. Although &quot;The Look&quot; wasn&#x27;t as successful as &quot;Friends&quot; had been the previous year, it still went Gold in the UK, where it yielded a number of hit singles, including &quot;Disappearing Act&quot;, the Grammy-nominated &quot;Dead Giveaway&quot;, and &quot;Over and Over&quot;, and featured more of a new wave/synth-pop sound than previous albums.

After Micki Free and Delisa Davis replaced Daniel and Watley in the group&#x27;s lineup, Shalamar reached number17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot;, featured on the &quot;Footloose&quot; soundtrack album, and contributed &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Stopped in Beverly Hills,&quot; written by Hewett, Free, and David &quot;Hawk&quot; Wolinski, to the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack, which won the 1985 Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special; the award was given to all 14 of the soundtrack&#x27;s songwriters. Both &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Stopped in Beverly Hills&quot; were included on Shalamar&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Heartbreak&quot;, released in November 1984.

Hewett departed the group in 1985 to begin a solo career. Sydney Justin took over as lead vocalist for &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot; (1987), coproduced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, and &quot;Wake Up&quot; (1990), Shalamar&#x27;s final pair of albums before they disbanded.

==Reunions==
In 1996, Watley performed with Hewett and Daniel on Babyface&#x27;s million-selling single &quot;This Is for the Lover in You,&quot; a cover of a hit single from Shalamar&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Three for Love&quot;. A music video was shot in which the three former members of Shalamar were digitally reunited on screen. They are credited on this single release under their individual names. Hewett, Watley, and Daniel subsequently joined Babyface and LL Cool J to perform the song on the UK&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1996; billed as Shalamar, it marked the classic trio&#x27;s first and only live performance together since 1983.

In 1999, Howard Hewett and Jeffrey Daniel reformed Shalamar and played in Japan. This was followed by UK tours in 2000, 2001, and 2003. From 2001, Shalamar continued touring with the line up of Howard Hewett, Jeffrey Daniel, and Carolyn Griffey (a long-time friend and fan of the original band&#x27;s, and daughter of Shalamar&#x27;s creator and Dick Griffey). Carolyn&#x27;s mother is Carrie Lucas, for whom Watley sang backing vocals. In 2005, this lineup appeared on the UK television series &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time.&quot; Shalamar reached the grand finale of &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot; in May 2005, ultimately losing out to Shakin&#x27; Stevens. This was followed by annual concert tours in the UK, Cannes, USA, Nigeria, and Japan.

Shalamar was featured in an episode of TV One&#x27;s series &quot;Unsung&quot;, in which Watley, Daniel, and Hewett shared their stories about the group&#x27;s creation, the lack of payments and royalties from SOLAR, success, egos, and the breakup of the classic lineup. Dick Griffey, Micki Free, Delisa Davis, and Sidney Justin were also interviewed for the episode.

In October 2009, the reconstituted Shalamar of Hewett, Daniel, and Griffey performed as a part of &quot;The Ultimate Boogie Nights Disco Concert Series&quot;, at O2 Arena Entertainment in London. This prompted their return to the UK in April 2010 for a tour. Shalamar returned to IndigO2 in October 2011, December 2012, December 2013 and December 2014. 

Since 2015 Shalamar featuring Howard, Jeffrey and Carolyn have been performing regularly in the UK with up to thirty shows annually including venues such as: The London Palladium, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Liverpool Philharmonic, The M&amp;S Bank Arena, The Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Usher Hall (Edinburgh), The Royal Concert Hall Nottingham and many other leading venues. The group have also performed in France, South Africa, Spain, Holland and Mozambique. Festivals where the group performed have included: Boogietown, Soultasia, Love Supreme, The Cambridge Club Festival, Lets Rock and Rewind. 

In 2017, Shalamar released their first single since 1991 called &quot;The Real Thing&quot;

As of July 2018, Carrie Lucas and Carolyn Griffey, wife and daughter of Shalamar creator Dick Griffey, officially own all Shalamar licensing across the UK and 28 countries of Europe.

Carolyn Griffey once challenged Jody Watley&#x27;s trademark of Shalamar in the United States, claiming that she (Griffey) was the sole owner of the name. Watley countered, and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled in her favor, saying that the petitioner (Griffey) never submitted evidence of her claims. Watley owns the Shalamar trademark in the United States.

In September 2023, Shalamar were awarded a stone on the Music Walk Of Fame in Camden. Howard, Jeffrey and Carolyn were in London to accept the award on behalf of all Shalamar members over the years. Speeches and tributes were made by DJ Spoony, Angie Greaves, Neville Staple, Gwen Dickey and Jaki Graham with video tributes from Nile Rodgers, Kathy Sledge, Danny_John-Jules, Emeli Sandé, Kid Creole, Tony Blackburn and Alexander O&#x27;Neal.

In 2024 the group performed six concerts across the USA including the &quot;Fool In Love&quot; Festival which included acts such as Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson, The Jacksons and many other legends.

<text>The Federation of Family History Societies, also known as The Federation, is a United Kingdom-based charitable organisation. In 2019 it rebranded to the Family History Federation

Its stated principal aims are &quot;to co-ordinate and assist the work of societies or other bodies interested in family history, genealogy and heraldry; to foster the spirit of mutual co-operation, by sponsoring projects in these fields&quot;.

Its membership consists of over 170 family history societies and similar genealogical organisations. It publishes The National Burial Index from data supplied largely by family history societies.

In January 2014, The National Archives put online the digitised records of over 8,000 individuals seeking exemption from conscription into the army in Middlesex during the First World War. The Federation assisted in funding this exercise. In the same month, The National Archives announced work to accelerate progress with the revision of the Manorial Documents Register and that funding from The Federation will help meet the cost of four additional county projects over the following two years. The relevant counties are Northumberland, Northamptonshire, Wiltshire and Kent.

The current Chairman is Stephen Manning.

<text>Antoine-Frédéric Ozanam (; 23 April 1813 – 8 September 1853) was a French Catholic literary scholar, lawyer, journalist and equal rights advocate. He founded with fellow students the Conference of Charity, later known as the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris in 1997. His feast day is 9 September.

==Life==

Frédéric Ozanam was born on Friday, 23 April 1813, to Jean and Marie Ozanam. He was the fifth of 14 children, one of only three to reach adulthood. His family, which had distant Jewish connections, had been settled in the region around Lyon, France, for many centuries. An ancestor of Frédéric, Jacques Ozanam (1640–1717), was a noted mathematician. Jean Ozanam, Frédéric&#x27;s father, had served in the armies of the First French Republic, but with the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the founding of the First French Empire, he turned to trade, to teaching, and finally to medicine.

Ozanam was born in Milan, but brought up in Lyon. In his youth, he experienced a period of doubt regarding the Catholic faith, during which he was strongly influenced by one of his teachers at the Collège de Lyon, the priest (known usually as the Abbé Noirot). His religious instincts showed themselves early, and in 1831 he published &quot;Réflexions sur la Doctrine de Saint-Simon,&quot; a pamphlet against Saint-Simonianism, which attracted the attention of the French poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine who was born in the area. Ozanam also found time to help organize and write for the Association for the Propagation of the Faith, a lay Catholic organization founded in the city with the aim of supporting Catholic missionaries, many of whom came from the area. That autumn he went to study law in Paris, where he suffered a great deal from homesickness. Ozanam fell in with the Ampère family (living for a time with the mathematician André-Marie Ampère), and through them with other prominent liberal Catholics of the time, such as Count François-René de Chateaubriand, and Charles Forbes René de Montalembert.

While still a student, Ozanam took up journalism and contributed considerably to Bailly&#x27;s &quot;Tribune catholique&quot;, which became &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot;, a French Catholic daily newspaper that adopted a strongly ultramontane position. Ozanam and his friends revived a discussion group called a &quot;Society of Good Studies&quot; and formed it into a &quot;Conference of History&quot; which quickly became a forum for large and lively discussions among students. Their attentions turned frequently to the social teachings of the Gospel. At one meeting during a heated debate in which Ozanam and his friends were trying to prove from historical evidence alone the truth of the Catholic Church as the one founded by Christ, their adversaries declared that, though at one time the Church was a source of good, it no longer was. One voice issued the challenge, &quot;What is your church doing now? What is She doing for the poor of Paris? Show us your works and we will believe you!&quot;

As a consequence, in May 1833 Ozanam and a group of other young men founded the charitable Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which already by the time of his death numbered upwards of 2,000 members. The founding members developed their method of service under the guidance of Sister Rosalie Rendu, a member of the Congregation of Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, who was prominent in serving the poor in the slums of Paris. The members of the conferences collaborated with Rendu during the time of the cholera epidemic. When fear had gripped the population, she organized the conferences in all the neighborhoods of Paris to care for the cholera victims, becoming well known in the city for her work, especially in the 12th arrondissement. Frederic&#x27;s first act of charity was to take his supply of winter firewood and bring it to a widow whose husband had died of cholera.

Ozanam received the degrees of Bachelor of Laws in 1834, Bachelor of Arts in 1835 and Doctor of Laws in 1836. His father, who had wanted him to study law, died on 12 May 1837. Although he preferred literature, Ozanam worked in the legal profession in order to support his mother, and was admitted to the Bar in Lyon in 1837. 

In 1835, Ozanam persuaded Monseigneur de Quélen, the Archbishop of Paris, to ask Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire to preach a Lenten series at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, as part of the Notre-Dame Lectures specially aimed at the catechesis of Christian youth, which had been inaugurated at the behest of his friend Ozanam. Lacordaire&#x27;s first lecture took place on 8 March 1835, and was met with wide acclaim. Lacordaire was reputed to be the greatest pulpit orator of the nineteenth century. The social event of its day, it was well-attended and became an annual tradition in Paris. According to Thomas Bokenkotter, Lacordaire&#x27;s Notre Dame Conferences, &quot;...proved to be one of the most dramatic events of nineteenth century church history.&quot;

Still, he also pursued his personal interest, and in 1839 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Letters with a thesis on Dante that then formed the basis of Ozanam&#x27;s best-known books. A year later he was appointed to a professorship of commercial law at Lyon, and in 1840, at the age of twenty-seven, assistant professor of foreign literature at the Sorbonne. He decided to give a course of lectures on German Literature in the Middle Ages and in preparation for it went on a short tour of Germany. His lectures proved highly successful despite the fact that he attached fundamental importance to Christianity as the primary factor in the growth of European civilization, unlike his predecessors and most of his colleagues, who shared in the predominantly anti-Christian climate of the Sorbonne at that time.

In June 1841, he married Amélie Soulacroix, daughter of the rector of the University of Lyon, and the couple travelled to Italy for their honeymoon. They had a daughter, Marie.

Candelas describes Ozanam as &quot; ... a man of great faith. He valued friendships and defended his friends no matter what the cost. He was attentive to details, perhaps to the extreme. ... [H]e showed a great tenderness when dealing with his family. ...He had a great reverence for his parents, and revealed his ability to sacrifice his career and his profession in order to please them.

Upon the death in 1844 of Claude Charles Fauriel, Ozanam succeeded to the full professorship of foreign literature at the Sorbonne. The remainder of his short life was extremely busy, attending to his duties as a professor, his extensive literary activities, and the work of district-visiting as a member of the society of St. Vincent de Paul.

During the French Revolution of 1848, of which he took a sanguine view, he once more turned journalist by writing, for a short time, in various papers, including the &quot;Ère nouvelle&quot; (&quot;New Era&quot;), which he had founded. He traveled extensively, and visited England at the time of the Exhibition of 1851.

==Death==
His naturally weak constitution fell prey to consumption, which he hoped to cure by visiting Italy, but on his return to France he died in Marseille on Thursday, 8 September 1853, at the age of 40. He was buried in the crypt of the church of St. Joseph des Carmes at the Institut Catholique in Paris.

==Works==

Ozanam &quot;is recognized as a precursor of the Catholic Church&#x27;s social doctrine, whose cultural and religious origins he wanted to know and on which he wrote books which are still in great demand.&quot; In contemporary movements, he was an earnest and conscientious advocate of Catholic democracy and of the view that the Church should adapt itself to the changed political conditions consequent to the French Revolution. He denounced the old alliance of &quot;Throne and Altar&quot; and pleaded with the Pope to adopt more liberal positions. He advocated the separation of church and state as conducive to liberty, and he was frequently impugned by reactionaries who accused him of deserting the Church.

In his writings he dwelt upon important contributions of historical Christianity, and maintained especially that, in continuing the work of the Caesars, the Catholic Church had been the most potent factor in civilizing the invading barbarians and in organizing the life of the Middle Ages. He confessed that his object was to prove the contrary thesis to Edward Gibbon, and, although the aim of proving theses is perhaps not the ideal approach for a historian, Ozanam no doubt administered a healthful antidote to the prevalent notion, particularly amongst English-speaking peoples, that the Catholic Church had done far more to enslave than to elevate the human mind. His knowledge of medieval literature and his appreciative sympathy with medieval life admirably qualified him for his work, and his scholarly attainments are still highly esteemed.

His works were published in the eleven volume &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot;, edited by Jean-Jacques Ampère (Paris, 1862–1865). They include:
* (2nd ed., enlarged 1845)
* Translated by A. C. Glyn as &quot;History of Civilization in the Fifth Century&quot; (London, 1868)
* 
* His letters were partly translated into English by A. Coates (London, 1886).

<text>Rose Royce is an American soul and R&amp;B group. They are best known for several hit singles during the 1970s including &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Get Next to You&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Going Down&quot;, &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot;, and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;.

==Career==
The Los Angeles-based group comprised Gwen Dickey (vocals), Henry Garner (drums), Terral &quot;Terry&quot; Santiel (congas), Lequeint &quot;Duke&quot; Jobe (bass), Michael Moore (saxophone), Kenny Copeland (trumpet, lead vocals), Kenji Brown (guitar, lead vocals), Freddie Dunn (trumpet), and Victor Nix (keyboards). The group began in the early 1970s when members of several backup bands from the Watts and Inglewood areas of Los Angeles united under the name Total Concept Unlimited. In 1973, this collective toured England and Japan behind Motown soul star Edwin Starr. Starr introduced them to Norman Whitfield.

Whitfield, after a decade at Motown, wanted to start a company of his own. He took the T.C.U. octet under his wing and signed them to his label. The group, now called Magic Wand, began working with Yvonne Fair and became the studio and concert band for the Undisputed Truth. During a tour stop in Miami, Undisputed Truth leader Joe Harris noticed a singer named Gwen Dickey, then a member of a local group called the Jewels. Harris informed Whitfield of his discovery and Dickey was flown to Los Angeles to audition. Whitfield asked Gwen to join the band, and gave her the stage name of Rose Norwalt. This was the lineup for the band&#x27;s debut album.

During this time, Whitfield was contacted by film director Michael Schultz, fresh from the success of his first feature, &quot;Cooley High&quot;. Schultz offered Whitfield the opportunity to score his next picture, &quot;Car Wash&quot;. Whitfield would use the film to launch his new group and began composing music based on script outlines. He and the band visited the film set, soaking up the atmosphere. The band composed the music concurrently with the picture instead of after the fact, which was not very common at the time. In the spirit of the soundtrack, the band&#x27;s name was changed one final time to &#x27;Rose Royce&#x27;. The name not only referenced the movie&#x27;s automotive theme (as the group&#x27;s name closely resembled Rolls-Royce luxury cars), but just as Rolls-Royce cars are premier vehicles, the group was metaphorically stating they were a premier group. The name also helped place Gwen &quot;Rose&quot; Dickey somewhat front and center.

The movie &quot;Car Wash&quot; and the soundtrack were great successes, bringing the group national fame. Whitfield won the Best Music award at the Cannes Film Festival, and the album received the Grammy for Best Motion Picture Score Album of the Year. Released in late 1976, the soundtrack featured three Billboard R&amp;B top ten singles: &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Get Next to You&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Going Down&quot;. The first of these was also a number one single on the Billboard popular music chart, and &quot;I Wanna Get Next to You&quot; reached number 10. Rose Royce also played instruments behind the Pointer Sisters singing &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; in the film. June Pointer remembers Whitfield pushing Dickey to sing better at the rehearsals, saying &quot;Why can&#x27;t you sing like the Pointer Sisters?&quot;

The group&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom&quot;, produced two top ten singles, &quot;Do Your Dance&quot; and &quot;Ooh Boy&quot;. It also included &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot;, which for Rose Royce was a top-10 hit only in the UK; it became notable elsewhere through its cover versions, including the Cover Girls&#x27; top ten single in 1992.

In 1978, they released their third album, entitled &quot;Rose Royce III: Strikes Again!&quot;, and it featured &quot;I&#x27;m in Love (And I Love the Feeling)&quot; and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. Both singles entered the Billboard R&amp;B top five. &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; was a number 2 hit in the UK Singles Chart, and would later gain greater exposure through its cover versions, most notably by Madonna in 1984 and 1995.

The single &quot;Is It Love You&#x27;re After?&quot; was released in 1979, taken from the album &quot;Rainbow Connection IV&quot;, the last album with lead singer Gwen Dickey before she left to embark on a solo career. It was the band&#x27;s fourth highest-charting single in the UK.

The group followed with a series of modest successes that reached the charts but never gained the status that their previous songs did. Dickey left the group in April 1980 and Rose Royce temporarily disbanded. However, the remaining members regrouped, adjusted the line-up, and kept the group somewhat popular in the UK, where they remained a marquee attraction.

Singer Ricci Benson replaced Dickey, taking over lead female vocals between the 1980 album &quot;Golden Touch&quot; and the 1986 album &quot;Fresh Cut&quot;. Lisa Taylor then replaced Benson for the 1989 album &quot;Perfect Lover&quot;.

Rose Royce was featured in TV One&#x27;s seasonal series, &quot;Unsung&quot; during the spring of 2010. The story featured the successes and internal bickering of the group. Dickey, Copeland, Jobe, Moore and Garner were the only members of the band who gave interviews throughout the program. Dickey now performs as a solo artist in the UK but mentioned during the interview that she would not mind performing with the group once again. From 2012 to 2013, R&amp;B vocalist Debelah Morgan joined the band as their lead singer for a few shows. Additionally, Bag Raiders and Daft Punk sampled their single &quot;First Come, First Serve&quot; with the songs &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; and &quot;Too Long&quot; respectively.

Gwen Dickey formed her own version of Rose Royce - Gwen Dickey&#x27;s Rose Royce and in 2021 and 2022 toured the UK nationally. In 2022 Gwen featured on the Giants of Soul Tour - taking in 15 UK venues performing with Deniece Williams, Alexander O&#x27;Neal, Tunde (Lighthouse Family) and Jaki Graham. In 2023 Gwen Dickey&#x27;s Rose Royce headlined at The London Palladium

<text>Zephire Andre Williams (November 1, 1936 – March 17, 2019) was an American R&amp;B musician who started his career in the 1950s at Fortune Records in Detroit. His most famous songs include the hits &quot;Jail Bait&quot;, &quot;Greasy Chicken&quot;, &quot;Bacon Fat&quot; (1957) and &quot;Cadillac Jack&quot; (1966). He was also the co-author of the R&amp;B hit &quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Bessemer, Alabama, United States, Williams lived in a housing project with his mother until she died when he was six years of age. A sly and smart young boy, his &quot;aunties&quot; raised him until he was around 16. He then set out on his own and moved to Detroit, Michigan. There, he became friends with Jack and Devora Brown, owners of Fortune Records which was located at the back of a barber shop. Williams would become label mates with Nolan Strong and Nathaniel Mayer.

He then became lead singer for The 5 Dollars in 1955, which already had a contract with Fortune Records. Though most of the songs were billed as &#x27;Andre Williams and the Don Juans&#x27; (on Epic in 1956 billed as &#x27;Andre Mr Rhythm Williams and his New Group&#x27;), &quot;Bacon Fat&quot; and &quot;Jail Bait&quot; were solo efforts. &quot;Bacon Fat&quot; hit #9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1957. &quot;Bacon Fat&quot; (written by Williams) was such a success that Fortune Records sold the song to Epic Records, a much larger distributor (released as Epic 5-9196 &quot;Bacon Fat/Just because of a Kiss&quot;). In 1960 Fortune released an album of all of his singles with the Don Juans, which was titled &quot;Jail Bait&quot; (re-released in 1984). In 1960, he appeared on Motown&#x27;s Miracle Record label recording &quot;Rosa Lee&quot;.

In the early 1960s, Williams co-wrote Stevie Wonder&#x27;s first song, &quot;Thank You for Loving Me&quot;. Williams&#x27;s &quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot; (with Otha Hayes and Verlie Rice) was also a hit in 1963 for the Five Du-Tones and then for Ike &amp; Tina Turner plus James and Bobby Purify. Alvin Cash &amp; the Crawlers also made a hit out of the Williams song &quot;Twine Time&quot;. As well as these hits, Williams also supervised the making of two albums by The Contours. Additionally, in the 1960s, Williams was the manager and roadie for Edwin Starr.

In 1966, Williams released two records on the Avin Records label, then two records more on Detroit&#x27;s Wingate label: &quot;Loose Juice&quot; and &quot;Do It&quot;. On the Ric-Tic label in 1967, he released &quot;You Got It and I Want It&quot;. In 1968, Williams was signed to Chess Records on Checker, Chicago&#x27;s major blues label. They released many hits for Williams—&quot;Humpin&#x27; Bumpin&#x27; and Thumpin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Jack&quot; in particular. &quot;Cadillac Jack&quot; reached No. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, his second and final chart hit. Then, he began to work with many unknown black labels and released songs such as &quot;Sweet Little Pussy Cat&quot; and &quot;Rib Tips, Pts. 1 &amp; 2&quot;. In 1968, Williams collaborated with the Natural Bridge Bunch to release &quot;Pig Snoots&quot;, a novelty song about a man named Ricky who would &quot;come all way cross town to get me some snoots&quot;. In the 1970s, Williams wrote some songs for Parliament and Funkadelic. Williams also began to produce for Ike Turner.

Throughout the 1980s, Williams was in poverty because of his drug addictions. He lived in Chicago, Illinois; at one point, he was homeless.

In 1996, he released &quot;Mr. Rhythm&quot;, which featured new renditions of his old tunes from the &quot;Jail Bait&quot; era. These included &quot;The Greasy Chicken&quot;, &quot;Mean Jean&quot;, and &quot;Pass the Biscuits Please&quot;. He changed his style with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Silky&quot;. In 1999, he began his relationship with Bloodshot Records by recording a country album with The Sadies, entitled &quot;Red Dirt&quot;. In 2000, Williams released &quot;The Black Godfather&quot;, with two songs backed by The Dirtbombs. In 2001 he discussed his recent conversion to Judaism and circumcision. In 2002 and 2003 he toured with the Dutch sleaze rock band, Green Hornet.

A return to soul-style music came with &quot;Aphrodisiac&quot; in 2006. &quot;The result is a more laid-back and funky groove that&#x27;s soulful but potent at the same time, fusing &#x27;70s blaxploitation sounds, Jimmy Smith-style jazz figures, and Booker T.-influenced R&amp;B workouts into one solid package&quot; is the way Mark Deming described the album.

Williams toured Europe in 2001 (with Green Hornet as backing band), 2005 and 2006 (with the Marshall Brothers). From August to November 2006, he had a short European tour, ending in Switzerland. In early 2008 he undertook a European tour with The Flash Express.

In 2007, Williams finished recording an album with the New Orleans–based band, Morning 40 Federation. The album, titled &quot;Can You Deal With It&quot;, was released by Bloodshot Records in 2008 and is credited to Andre Williams &amp; the New Orleans Hellhounds (the pseudonymous Morning 40 Federation). The 2007 documentary &quot;Agile Mobile Hostile: A Year with Andre Williams&quot; told of Williams&#x27;s early career at Fortune Records, his hard life on the streets of Chicago in the 1980s, drug and alcohol abuse, his return to the stage and recording studio in 1995, and his current life and musical career.

In 2010, Williams contributed a cover version of &quot;The Way You Dog Me Around&quot; for the compilation album, &quot;Daddy Rockin Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong &amp; The Diablos&quot;. The album was a tribute to the late Nolan Strong.

In the summer of 2010, Williams worked on an EP with the up-and-coming producer Kerry (Kerby) Moncreace, founder of Kraw Productions. Andre Williams and his longtime best friend, Ricardo &quot;Mississippi Rick&quot; Williams, co-wrote with Kerry Moncreace, five rap songs including the urban song that tells the story of a hustler whose woman turns him into the federal government for drug trafficking, &quot;Gangbangin&#x27;&quot;.

Williams had also been known to go by the alias &quot;Rudibaker&quot; or &quot;Rutabaga&quot;, with which he would put on a different personality and speak in a gravely voice.

In 2012, Williams was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

Andre Williams died March 17, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, at the age of 82.

<text>Henry Peters Gray (June 23, 1819 - November 12, 1897) was an American portrait and genre painter.

==Early life==
Born in New York City he was a pupil of Daniel Huntington in New York, and subsequently studied in Rome and Florence.

==Career==
Elected a member of the National Academy of Design in 1842, he succeeded Huntington as president in 1870, holding the position until 1871.

The later years of his life were devoted to portrait work. He was strongly influenced by the old Italian masters, painting in mellow colour with a classical tendency. One of his notable canvases was an allegorical composition called &quot;The Birth of our Flag&quot; (1875). He died in New York City.

===Major works===
&quot;The Greek Lovers&quot; was painted by Gray after a trip to Italy, where he was greatly influenced by the art of the Italian Renaissance. This painting was very well received in its day, and reflects the nineteenth-century fascination with Greco-Roman antiquity.

&quot;The Pride of the Village&quot; was based on Washington Irving’s story of the same name and is about a beautiful and simple country girl, the proverbial &quot;pride of the village,&quot; who fell in love with an army officer. When the officer is transferred to another post, he asks that she accompany him, however, her pure mind was so upset by this indecorous suggestion that she pined away, surrounded by her devoted family. The painting shows her in her decline, possibly &quot;thinking of her faithless lover?—or were her thoughts wandering to that distant churchyard, into whose bosom she might soon be gathered?&quot;

<text>Damiano Cunego (born 19 September 1981) is an Italian former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2002 and 2018 for the , and teams.

Cunego&#x27;s biggest wins were the 2004 Giro d&#x27;Italia, the 2008 Amstel Gold Race, and the Giro di Lombardia in 2004, 2007 and 2008. He finished second in the UCI Road World Championships in 2008 and in the 2008 UCI ProTour. Primarily a climber, he improved his time-trialing and was characterized by great sprinting ability, unusual for a climber.

==Career==
===Saeco–Longoni Sport (2002–04)===
Born in Cerro Veronese, Veneto, Cunego began cycling as a teenager after being a successful cross-country runner. He was discovered by Giuseppe Martinelli who also worked closely with Marco Pantani. Cunego turned professional in 2002 at the age of 20 with , winning the Giro d&#x27;Oro and the Giro Medio Brenta in his first season. In 2003 he won the seventh stage and the overall classification of the Tour of Qinghai Lake.

He came to prominence in May 2004, winning the Giro d&#x27;Italia at the age of 22 with . Cunego&#x27;s strength came as a blow to his captain Gilberto Simoni; relations between the two during the race were strained when Cunego sprinted away from Simoni to win the 18th stage after Simoni&#x27;s solo breakaway. &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; reported that as Simoni passed by Cunego, who was surrounded by journalists, Simoni pointed his finger at Cunego and angrily said &quot;You&#x27;re a bastard...you are really stupid.&quot; During 2004 he won the Giro di Lombardia in October, his 13th victory of the season. He finished the season number one in the UCI Road World Cup, the youngest rider to achieve it, aged 23. He was also the last rider ranked first on the world ranking, because from 2005 the ranking was replaced by the UCI ProTour.

===Lampre (2005–14)===

In the 2005 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Simoni and Cunego were co-captains of , but Cunego posed no threat to Simoni, as he faltered during the first climb in the Dolomites, losing six minutes in the day and any prospect of winning. At the time his team attributed his loss to a &quot;psychological crisis&quot; and Cunego said &quot;a great weight has been lifted from me by this defeat.&quot; After the race, he was found to have Epstein–Barr virus, and he did not enter the 2005 Tour de France.

In 2006, Cunego finished third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège losing to Alejandro Valverde and Paolo Bettini in a sprint finish. In the Tour de France Cunego was the winner of the young rider classification; he finished 2nd on stage 15 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez, after losing to Fränk Schleck, who broke away in the final . He also finished 3rd on stage 17, on the road to Morzine. In 2007 Cunego again won the Giro del Trentino and his second Giro di Lombardia.

In 2008 he won the Klasika Primavera and the Amstel Gold Race, with two powerful sprints against Valverde and Schleck, with victory in the latter propelling him to the top of the UCI Pro Tour rankings, as he also went on to finish second in the UCI Road World Championships. He was widely tipped to be victorious in the Tour de France, but he struggled and eventually dropped out before the finish. By the end of the year Cunego conquered for the third time at the Giro di Lombardia and then he ended the season with victory in the Japan Cup, confirming himself as one of the best Classics specialists in the world. In 2009 he won the Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali with victories in two stages; later he won two mountain stages at Vuelta a España, which made him one of the favourites for the road race at the UCI Road World Championships. He ultimately finished that race in eighth position.
In July 2013, he was one of 27 former riders and officials linked to the team indicted for doping in an Italian court, with a hearing set for 10 December 2013. In early 2014 however, details emerged that indicated that Cunego might have been one of few Lampre riders to refuse treatment by Spanish doctor José Ibarguren Taus, who was linked to doping practices.

===Nippo–Vini Fantini (2015–18)===
In October 2014, it was announced that Cunego was to leave to ride with in 2015.

==Post-career==
In June 2020, Cunego was hospitalised due to ventriculitis, an infection of the cerebral ventricle.

In early 2020, Cunego was profiled in British magazine Cyclist. He was quoted as saying that believes that the increased media attention and sponsor obligations interfered with his training and mental focus, ultimately preventing him from achieving his full potential after his 2004 Giro victory and other initial successes. He also expressed concern about the state of 2020s Italian cycling, highlighting the lack of emerging talent compared to other nations.

<text>Finley Quaye (born 25 March 1974, Edinburgh, Scotland) is a Scottish musician. He won the 1997 Mobo Award for best reggae act, and the 1998 BRIT Award for Best Male Solo Artist. His debut album, &quot;Maverick a Strike,&quot; a fusion of many styles including reggae and soul, was a commercial success and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry.

==Life==
Finley Quaye is the son of vaudeville pianist Cab Kaye and the half-brother of the English guitarist Caleb Quaye.

Born in Edinburgh, Quaye went to school in London, Manchester and Edinburgh. However, he left school with no qualifications because of domestic violence in the household. Before making records he took employment spraying cars, smoking fish, making futons and as a stage-rigger and scaffolder.

His father was born in London, but considered himself as African. Although known as Cab Kaye, his full name was Nii Lante Augustus Kwamlah Quaye and he was a Chief of the Ga tribe centralized in Jamestown, Accra, Ghana. Kaye was the son of the pianist Caleb Jonas Quaye a.k.a. Mope Desmond, who was born in Accra, Ghana. Finley did not grow up with his father and only found out fully, in his twenties, about his father&#x27;s history as a musician. Mope Desmond, Cab Kaye and Finley Quaye have all played Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowlands, Wolverhampton&#x27;s Wulfrun Hall and London&#x27;s Cafe de Paris. Finley was on tour with his band when he met his father for the first time in Amsterdam.

Finley Quaye was inspired early on in his childhood by jazz musicians Pete King, Ronnie Scott, who started his musical career making tea and running errands in Finley&#x27;s father&#x27;s band, and Lionel Hampton. Quaye heard jazz as a child, living in London with his mother, who would take him with her to Ronnie Scott&#x27;s jazz club to catch performances of American jazz musicians touring Europe such as Buddy Rich, who recorded his live album there in 1980 and also Ella Fitzgerald. Quaye&#x27;s mother had long-term relationships with musician Pete King, who hosted and performed at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s club in Frith Street, London. Around this time Finley was also taken along to see the likes of The Ramones in rehearsal, with journalist photo editor for the music press the NME / Melodymaker, Howard a dear friend of his Mum&#x27;s, Sharon. In Edinburgh shows that made an impact in early years were Frank Chickens during the Fringe Festival at The Hole in the Ground that was behind the Usher Hall. Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac at The Venue with Cozy Powell on drums around 1990. Art has always been an influence and a constant source of inspiration and central to Finley Quaye&#x27;s mind set and artistic approach. Finley Quaye attended The Frieze ART Fair at Regents Park as well as Gilbert &amp; George and Harlan Miller exhibitions and opening nights. Finley gave awards away at The Indian Film Awards at The Millennium dome in London as well as David Gray&#x27;s Ivor Novello at The Dorchester Hotel in London.

Cab Kaye died while depressed in Amsterdam and ultimately died by Euthanasia which was organised by immediate family without Finley&#x27;s approval or consent. Since then Finley has been unable to accept his Father&#x27;s death or celebrate his life, or to write books about this or to make films covering this episode of his life.

Finley&#x27;s youngest of two sons, Caleb Quaye, tragically took his own life in 2023.

==Career==
Quaye made a solo recording contract with Polydor Records and moved to New York City. He began working with Epic/Sony unlawfully while he was still signed to Polydor, and in late 1997 he reached the UK Top 20 twice, with &quot;Sunday Shining&quot; and &quot;Even After All&quot;. His reputation was established by &quot;Maverick a Strike&quot;, released in September 1997. It went gold less than three weeks later, and led directly to the BRIT Award victory. The album is now certified 2× platinum in the UK. In 1998, Quaye recorded and produced George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to George Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness.

Two more albums were released on Epic, &quot;Vanguard&quot; (2000) and &quot;Much More Than Much Love&quot; (2004). &quot;Spiritualized&quot; became his last single to score a top 40 landing in the UK chart when it was released in September 2000, reaching number 26. In 2004 the single &quot;Dice&quot; was released in collaboration with William Orbit and featuring Beth Orton. The song featured in Fox Network&#x27;s &quot;The OC&quot; and on the season 1 soundtrack, becoming a minor hit.

He released the EP &quot;Pound for Pound&quot; with Intune Records in 2008, with Norman Grant of the Twinkle Brothers featuring Sly Dunbar and Lloyd Parks.

Three albums were made between 2019 and 2023 but also removed from distribution and outlets because of lack of recognition, interest or support in the United kingdom in terms of live agents, labels and publishers. This was the sole reason for the removal of the material.

In 2021 Finley was awarded by Queen Elizabeth II, the Queens Award For Voluntary Service with Food For All, for preparing food and for campaigning as well as distributing free and hot food to the homeless in London between 2000 and 2024.
