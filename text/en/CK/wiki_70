<text>The Buick Park Avenue is a full-size car built by Buick. The nameplate was first used in 1975 for an appearance option package on the Electra 225 Limited. It became an Electra trim level in 1978 and its own model starting in the 1991 model year after the Electra was discontinued.

There were two generations of the Park Avenue that were manufactured in the United States until 2005. In 2007, the nameplate was revived on a large Buick sedan built by Shanghai GM for the Chinese market based on the Holden Caprice from the WM/WN range. The nameplate is derived from the affluent New York City boulevard, Park Avenue.

==Electra Park Avenue (1975–1990)==
1975–1976

Park Avenue first appeared as an appearance package on the 1975 Buick Electra Limited. It included similar seats to the Cadillac Sixty Special, optional full center console, Buick 455ci V8, posi-traction, 15-inch rallye sport wheels, rear automatic leveling, optional leather, optional Air Cushion Restraint System, remote mirror with thermometer, and automatic climate control. The 1976 cars were largely the same except for some styling revisions and added emissions systems.
1977–1984

Park Avenue, previously an appearance option package, became an official trim level on the Electra in 1978. Cosmetically, a different grille and redesigned tail lights were the only notable cosmetic changes that year but 1979 brought a redesigned, flat front end and a subtly different taillight treatment featuring a Buick crest and bisecting horizontal silver line. A more extensive redesign occurred for the 1980 model year.

1985–1990

Park Avenue remained the top trim on the Buick Electra, it was redesigned along with the rest of the Electra line, moving to the heavily downsized front wheel drive GM C-Body. It featured a Buick 3800 V6. The coupe version was discontinued in 1987. For 1989, Buick introduced the Park Avenue Ultra trim level. The Ultra was an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue trim and featured a standard leather interior with dual 20-way power front seats designed and manufactured by Lear Siegler and styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign; lower-body accent exterior paint treatment; distinctive thick-padded french-seamed vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra); simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel; unique aluminum wheels; anti-lock brakes; chromed B-pillar moldings; specific grille and tail lamps; leather-wrapped steering wheel; electronic instrumentation; padded glove-compartment door and unique interior door panel trim. The Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac&#x27;s Sedan de Ville. The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the &quot;Ultra&quot; badge offered even more features.

==Essence concept car==

The Buick Park Avenue Essence was a concept car designed and engineered by the Buick division of General Motors to showcase advanced technology and styling. First shown in 1989 in a metallic light green color, the Essence made rounds through the auto show circuits later in a metallic white. Inside the Essence was a wide, sweeping instrument panel that housed a prototype Delco Navicar navigation system among other innovations. Smooth, graceful body lines forecast the eventual production Park Avenue, introduced in 1990. The Essence was powered by the then-new 165 hp version of Buick&#x27;s 3800 OHV V6 engine.
==First generation (1991–1996)==
The 1991 Park Avenue, introduced in July 1990, used GM&#x27;s C platform and was previewed by the 1989 Park Avenue Essence show car. Much of the Park Avenue&#x27;s styling vocabulary made their way to subsequent Buick models restyled in the 1990s. Projections were for sales of 100,000 annually. 

The Park Avenue was Buick&#x27;s largest front-wheel-drive sedan, but the even larger rear-wheel-drive Roadmaster returned to the line for 1991 as a station wagon and 1992 as a sedan. However, the base Park Avenue was still priced higher than the Roadmaster Limited (its more luxurious trim). Park Avenue was marketed as the flagship of the Buick line. 

This generation featured DynaRide, a deflected-disc strut valving system which first appeared as standard on the Electra, LeSabre, Riviera, and Skylark in 1988. Also included was an automatic level control system, where an air compressor pressurized the rear Chapman struts to maintain an overall level ride height. DynaRide and automatic level control were not available on vehicles equipped with the optional Gran Touring suspension package. Larger 16&quot; aluminum wheels were also included with the package starting in 1992, while the standard model had 15&quot; aluminum wheels.

The base-model Park Avenue featured a 3.8 L naturally-aspirated V6 engine and velour interior, upgradeable to leather. Starting in 1992, the &quot;Ultra&quot; came with a 3.8 L supercharged V6 engine and leather interior. The Park Avenue received various exterior and interior cosmetic changes, as well as powertrain updates, during this run. Some of the new options and features added to the first generation included driver (and later passenger) airbags, dual-zone climate control, traction control, and variable-effort steering (Ultra only).

===Europe===
The Park Avenue was available in Europe from 1991 until 1996 and varied from the North American version by featuring a truncated taillamps with separate amber turn signal indicators and red brake lamps, wider numberplate bezel, fitment of rear red fog lamps, headlamps with different lens pattern, white front side running markers, amber front turn signal indicators, side turn signal repeaters, &quot;flagpole&quot; external rear-view mirrors (mirrors on US version are fixed and do not turn), different door handles, some with a badge mounted directly to the hood rather than an ornament, stronger seat belt and anchors, &quot;softer&quot; air bags, metric speedometer and gauges. They are to comply with the European regulatory and safety standards. This generation of the Park Avenue was the last Buick to be officially marketed by GM in Europe. This move was to reduce the &quot;cluttered&quot; model range that confused the European consumers. After 1996, Cadillac and Chevrolet remained the sole General Motors North American brands to be sold in Europe.

==Second generation (1997–2005)==
An updated Park Avenue was released in October 1996 as a 1997 model, using GM&#x27;s G platform, which was stronger and more substantial than its predecessor. GM chose to continue to refer to it as the C platform. 

The new generation was powered by updated Series II variants of the 3800 and as before, only Ultra models were supercharged. The base trim featured a hood ornament while the Ultra had a less conspicuous tri-shield inset on the upper edge of the grille. The base Park Avenue was the last USDM Buick to carry a factory hood ornament.

For 2001, the base model&#x27;s cloth interior was dropped as an option in favor of standard leather trim. Ultrasonic rear park assist was a new option that year as well. For 2003, trademark Buick &quot;Ventiports&quot; returned on the Park Avenue Ultra along with a bolder grille that carried a larger monochromatic tri-shield badge in the center. New 17-inch wheels, a revised interior and revised instrument cluster were changed for the 2003 model year on the Ultra.

For 2005, the final model year in North America, base Park Avenues received a revised grille, and the previously Ultra-exclusive Ventiports. Also, the rear fascia was updated across the model line with a prominent chrome bar above the license plate holder with an embossed &quot;Park Avenue&quot; script and amber turn signal flashers.

The last 3,000 of 7,000 Park Avenues carried Special Edition badging that featured the namesake script underneath a silhouette of the New York City skyline. 300 of these were painted with a special two-tone black-on-platinum finish. Production ended on June 18, 2004. The Park Avenue was discontinued after 2005 in the North American market and was replaced in 2006 by the Buick Lucerne.

==Third generation (2007–2012)==

In April 2007, General Motors reintroduced the Park Avenue nameplate in China on a luxury sedan that replaced the Buick Royaum. Like its predecessor, the vehicle is based on the Australian-built Holden Caprice (this time on the contemporary WM/WN generation), though, unlike the Royaum, it was assembled by Shanghai GM from CKD kits shipped from Holden&#x27;s Elizabeth factory in South Australia. It is offered in five trim levels: 舒适型 (Comfort), 精英型 (Elite), 豪华型 (Luxury - 2.8 only), 旗舰型 (Flagship) and 旗舰版 (Ultimate - 2010 only)

The Park Avenue was powered by Australian-built versions of the GM High Feature engine. The standard engines were the 2.8 L &quot;LP1&quot; and the 3.6 L &quot;LY7&quot; engine available as an option on the Elite and Flagship models from 2007 to 2009. The engine control unit is a Bosch E77 32-bit ECM processor.

In 2010, only one engine option was offered, a 3 L SIDI (251 bhp) replacing the old 2.8 V6 and 3.6 V6 due to fuel consumption with the 2.8 litre engine rated at 11.4 litres per 100 kilometres (20.6 MPG US) and the 3.6 litre engine rated 11.6 litres per 100 kilometres (20.3 MPG US) respectively. The 3 litre engine was rated 10.9 litres per 100 kilometres (21.6 MPG US). The third-generation Park Avenue remained a China exclusive and was never offered by Buick in North America. A version of the car did eventually see release in the US market as the stripped down, rebadged Chevrolet Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle).

It was discontinued in China in October 2012.

<text>The Old Dock, originally known as Thomas Steers&#x27; dock, was the world&#x27;s first commercial wet dock. 
The dock was built on the River Mersey in Liverpool, England, starting in 1710 and completed in 1716. A natural tidal pool off the River Mersey, which probably gave its name to Liverpool centuries earlier, was partially filled and locked in from the river with quay walls erected.

==History==
The Old Dock was built at a cost of £12,000 and opened on 31 August 1715. Thomas Steers was the engineer responsible; and additional advice was obtained from George Sorocold. Originally a tidal basin was accessed directly from the river, and from 1737 access was via Canning Dock. The dock was built with one graving dock; a second and third graving dock were added in 1746 and the 1750s. The dock walls were constructed from brick laid directly on to sandstone bedrock. The dock gates would have allowed as much as 10% of the water out between high tides, resulting in a water level drop of several feet. This may have been offset by water entering the dock from a stream. It accommodated up to 100 ships.

Although Liverpool vessels were involved in the slave trade before the dock opened, the &quot;Liverpool Merchant&quot; sailing for Africa on the 16 Oct 1699, and selling 220 slaves in Barbados in 1700, a second 30 tonne vessel being recorded as sailing for Africa in 1709, it would have served ships involved in the Africa-America trade, propelling Liverpool to world leader of this trade. 

The dock led to Liverpool&#x27;s establishment as the leading European port and subsequent world trading port.

==Redevelopment==

In the early 19th century, the dock was considered too small for the growing size of shipping using the port; the quays were too narrow; the city&#x27;s sewage polluted the dock&#x27;s water; and the narrow wooden drawbridge across its entrance channel caused traffic jams. Sentiment saved the Old Dock for 20 years, but the Old Dock closed on 31 August 1826 and was filled in. Liverpool’s fourth Custom House, designed by John Foster, was built on the site between 1828 and 1837, and was demolished after severe bomb damage during the Battle of Britain (World War II).

In 1999 an office block on the site, Steers House, was demolished, and the resulting waste ground was used as an NCP car park until 2004, when the site was incorporated into the Liverpool One shopping development. A water feature has been built on the site of Old Dock to commemorate its history. A portion of the dock wall is exposed in the basement of the new development, and can be viewed from the pavement above through a viewing window in the ground. The excavated site was opened to the public in May 2010. Tours of the Old Dock are currently operated by National Museums Liverpool on a weekly basis.

==Media==
The excavation of the dock featured in a &quot;Time Team&quot; Special episode, first broadcast on Channel 4 on Monday 21 April 2008.

==Old Dock Sill==
The level of the sill of its entrance is used in and around Liverpool as a height datum called Old Dock Sill or ODS.

<doc id="1139314" wikidata="Q4971024" url="?curid=1139314" title="British Seafarers' Union">
<text>The British Seafarers&#x27; Union (BSU) was a trade union which organised sailors and firemen in the British ports of Southampton and Glasgow between 1911/1912 and 1922. Although of considerable local importance, the organisation remained much smaller and less influential at a national level than the National Sailors&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Union, (NSFU).

The BSU was formed in Southampton on 6 October 1911, as a breakaway from the NSFU. In August 1912, a second breakaway took place in Glasgow, and a branch of the BSU was established in that port.

The cause of the split was ostensibly the same in both ports: the rebels claimed that the NSFU was reckless and extravagant with its funds, that members had little control over the direction of the organisation, and that its leading officials were unaccountable. The NSFU itself vigorously denied these allegations. It accused the BSU of sectionalism, and of being the product of the political ambitions of its leading officials, Tommy Lewis and Manny Shinwell.

In June 1912, the BSU took part in the national dock strike of 1912. The NSFU, although affiliated to the body which had called the strike, the National Transport Workers&#x27; Federation, refused to support the strike except in London.

Unlike the NSFU, the BSU was not granted a role on the National Maritime Board which was formed in 1917 to decide on working practices in the merchant shipping industry. In May 1921, the Board imposed wage reductions which were resisted by both the BSU and the National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards. Later that year, these two organisations were merged to form the Amalgamated Marine Workers&#x27; Union, (AMWU).

Bekmambetov was born on 25 June 1961 in the city of Atyrau, formerly known as Guriev. His father, Nuruakhit Bekmambetov, worked in management positions with the energy supplier GuryevEnergo. He was chief power engineer of Western Kazakhstan. His mother, Mira Bogoslovskaya, was deputy editor leading the party issues department at the regional newspaper &quot;Prikaspiyskaya Kommuna&quot;. He has Kazakh ancestry on his father&#x27;s side, and Jewish ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side.

After graduation from school, Bekmambetov entered the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1979 and left it in 1980, on the eve of the 1980 Summer Olympics. He was deported from Moscow on the grounds of being &quot;unreliable&quot; and moved to Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, to study at the Alexander Ostrovsky Theatrical and Artistic Institute, from which he graduated in 1987 with a degree in theater and cinema set design.

==Career==
===Film and television career===
Bekmambetov started his career in the late 1980s as a production designer at the Ilkhom Theatre in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and at Uzbek national film studio Uzbekfilm. He is currently signed to Artist International Group.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bekmambetov moved from Uzbekistan to Moscow, where he started making commercials for the Russian market. His commercial series &quot;World History&quot;, retelling life episodes of the world&#x27;s prominent rulers (from Nero and Tamerlan to Napoleon and the last Russian emperor Nicholas), is still considered the best video advertising in Russia. In 1994, he founded Bazelevs, an advertising and film production company, in Russia. Its advertising division continues making commercials for major Russian and international brands; in 2021, its commercial featuring Apple&#x27;s new iPhone in the Hermitage Museum interiors was nominated for the Cannes Lions festival.

Bekmambetov&#x27;s directorial debut was &quot;Peshavar Waltz&quot; (1994) depicting the war fought by the USSR in Afghanistan. The film was dubbed in English as &quot;Escape from Afghanistan&quot; and released direct-to-video by Roger Corman in 2002. In 1998, Corman invited Bekmambetov to direct his production of &quot;The Arena&quot; (2001) starring Karen McDougal and Lisa Dergan. The film was a remake of the 1974 gladiator exploitation film &quot;The Arena&quot;.

In 2004, Bekmambetov wrote and directed &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2004), a Russian fantasy film based on the book by Sergey Lukyanenko. The film was the first Russian production which, after the demise of the Soviet Union, managed to top the domestic box office, making US$16.7 million in Russia alone, thus overtaking &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The sequel to &quot;Night Watch&quot;, &quot;Day Watch&quot; (2006), was likewise written and directed by Bekmambetov and set a new record for the Russian domestic box office, having grossed more than US$26 million in the first two weeks. The Russian blockbuster epic attracted the attention of Fox Searchlight Pictures, which paid US$4 million to acquire the worldwide distribution rights (excluding Russia and the Baltic states). In 2010, &quot;Night Watch&quot; was named among the 100 Best Films of World Cinema by &quot;Empire&quot;. The film also received positive reactions from American directors Quentin Tarantino and James Gunn.

Bekmambetov&#x27;s Hollywood directorial debut was Universal&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Wanted&quot; (2008), an adaptation of the graphic novel series created by Mark Millar and J. G. Jones. Starring Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman, the action film grossed US$341 million worldwide, and became Universal&#x27;s highest grossing R-rated film, as well as earning two Oscar nominations.

In 2009, alongside Tim Burton and Jim Lemley, Bekmambetov produced an animated film titled &quot;9&quot; (2009), the story of a rag doll in a post-apocalyptic world, directed by Shane Acker.

In 2011, Bekmambetov produced the science fiction thriller &quot;Apollo 18&quot;, together with The Weinstein Company, and the science fiction film &quot;The Darkest Hour&quot;&quot;&quot; set in Moscow and produced by New Regency.

In 2012, Bekmambetov directed and produced the live-action adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith&#x27;s novel – &quot;Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter&quot;, together with Tim Burton and Jim Lemley. He was awarded the 2012 International Filmmaker of the Year award by the National Association of Theatre Owners.

In 2013, &quot;Variety&quot; (Russian Edition) named Bekmambetov one of the most commercially successful Russian directors of the decade.

In 2016, Bekmambetov directed &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, the fifth film adaptation of the novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; by Lew Wallace. At the same time, he produced the action film &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot;, directed by Ilya Naishuller, using the perspective of a first-person shooter.

In 2017, Bekmambetov produced the historical drama &quot;The Current War&quot; starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Nicholas Hoult and Michael Shannon. The film was inspired by the 19th-century war of currents between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse.

In 2021, Bekmambetov directed the WW2 action film &quot;V2. Escape from Hell&quot;, with its aircraft battle scenes using the War Thunder game engine. The film was released in Russia both theatrically as a feature and on a streaming platform as a smartphone-only vertical series.

In 2021, &quot;Deadline&quot; announced that Bekmambetov would be bringing to the screen a new universe based on the unexploited works in the horror genre by the Marvel Сomics creator Stan Lee. 

In December 2022, Bekmambetov sold the Bazelevs film studio in Russia to its general producer, Lala Rustamova, and commercial director, Timur Asadov. Bekmambetov has completely retired from the Russian business, but the studio will continue to cooperate with him as a filmmaker and screenwriter.

=== Screenlife filmmaking ===
Bekmambetov is the pioneer of the Screenlife filmmaking, thus responding to people&#x27;s life migrating to the digital world of mobile gadgets. In a screenlife film, viewers see the action play out from the POV of the computers, tablets or smartphones used by the characters.

In 2015, Bekmambetov&#x27;s debut screenlife production, the teen horror &quot;Unfriended&quot;, was picked up by Universal, grossing $65 million worldwide with a budget of $1 million; three years later, a sequel, &quot;&quot;, appeared.

Bekmambetov followed that up with the 2018 thriller led by John Cho, &quot;Searching&quot;, grossing more than $75 million worldwide. 

In 2019, he produced the ten-episode series &quot;Dead of Night&quot; for Snapchat, with the story revolving around a viral outbreak that turns people into zombies. It scored over 16 million viewers in the first releasing month, and got extended for the second season.

In 2020, Universal and Bekmambetov signed a deal to partner on five Hollywood features to be made in the screenlife format in various genres.

In 2021, Focus Features released &quot;Profile&quot;, Bekmambetov&#x27;s first directorial feature in the screenlife format, where a reporter goes online to catch a Jihadi recruiter to get a story on why and how European women join ISIS. Inspired by the 2015 nonfiction bestseller &quot;In the Skin of a Jihadist&quot; by a French journalist Anna Erelle, &quot;Profile&quot; won the 2018 Audience Award by Berlin Film Festival.

Bekmambetov&#x27;s recent screenlife production, &quot;R#J&quot;, a Gen Z adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, premiered at Sundance 2021 and won a special prize at SXSW.

The invention of the screenlife filmmaking technique brought Bekmambetov&#x27;s Bazelevs a spot among &quot;Fast Company&quot;″s 2021 World&#x27;s Most Innovative Companies.

== Personal life ==
Bekmambetov is the current owner of the former Walt Disney mansion in Los Angeles.

Bekmambetov is married to the Russian urbanist Natalia Fishman-Bekmambetova, who worked on the restoration of Gorky Park in Moscow and the renovation of the city of Kazan.

===Political views===

In a 2007 editorial about &quot;Day Watch&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bekmambetov compared president Vladimir Putin to the film&#x27;s &quot;light ones&quot;, saying &quot;[Light and dark] doesn&#x27;t mean good and bad. Dark means freedom and light means responsibility - and, in real life, Putin, for sure, is a light one. He is trying to fix everything, make everything organised somehow. But it&#x27;s very bad for freedom&quot;.

In 2022, Bekmambetov condemned Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, and called the boycott of Russian films in the West &quot;emotional, sincere and reasonable&quot;.

<text>Mario Sergio (born July 28, 1940) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Yorkview and York West. He served in cabinet in the government of Kathleen Wynne as a Minister without Portfolio from 2013 to 2016.

==Background==
Sergio attended technical school in Italy, and worked as a real estate broker after moving to Canada. He started his own general insurance business in 1961, and started a private real estate brokerage firm in 1968.

==Municipal politics==
Sergio was first elected to the North York City Council in 1978, and remained in municipal politics until 1995 when he was elected to the Ontario legislature. He also served on the Metro Toronto Council from 1985 to 1988, and was a member of North York&#x27;s Planning Board Committee for fourteen years.

==Provincial politics==
In the provincial election of 1995, Sergio defeated incumbent New Democrat George Mammoliti in Yorkview by almost 3000 votes to win election to the legislature. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Sergio joined 29 other Liberals in the official opposition.

In the 1999 provincial election, Sergio was re-elected in the new riding of York West by more than 10,000 votes over his nearest opponent. He was subsequently appointed deputy whip and critic for small business.

The Liberals won the 2003 election, in which Sergio defeated his closest opponent by over 12,000 votes. While in government he has served as parliamentary assistant to a number of different portfolios including Minister of Consumer and Business Services (2003–2004), Minister responsible for seniors (2005–2007), and Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing (2006-2010, 2011-2013). He was re-elected in 2007, 2011, and 2014.

In 2013, Sergio was appointed as a Minister without Portfolio with responsibility for Seniors. He left cabinet as part of a cabinet shuffle on June 13, 2016.

On July 13, 2017, Sergio announced that he would not seek re-election in the 42nd Ontario general election.

<text>The Philadelphia Firebirds are a women&#x27;s football team in the Independent Women&#x27;s Football League based in Philadelphia. They are in the Eastern Conference, North Atlantic Division with the Boston Militia, New York Nemesis, and New York Sharks. The team was formerly known as the Philadelphia Phoenix and formerly played in the National Women&#x27;s Football Association. Upon moving to the IWFL, they changed their name so as to avoid confusion with their fellow IWFL franchise, the Carolina Phoenix.

Philadelphia&#x27;s first women&#x27;s tackle football team was founded in 2001 as the Philadelphia Liberty Belles. The Belles won the inaugural NWFL Championship that year. In 2002, the Belles lost in the semi-final playoff round. Heading into the 2003 season, the team split and the Philadelphia Phoenix was formed. The two teams existed simultaneously until the Philadelphia Liberty Belles eventually folded. The Liberty Belles have since reformed for the 2009 season and have joined the new WFA.

<doc id="1139338" wikidata="Q1148456" url="?curid=1139338" title="Computable function">
<text>Computable functions are the basic objects of study in computability theory. Computable functions are the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithms, in the sense that a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can do the job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.
Particular models of computability that give rise to the set of computable functions are the Turing-computable functions and the general recursive functions.

According to the Church–Turing thesis, computable functions are exactly the functions that can be calculated using a mechanical (that is, automatic) calculation device given unlimited amounts of time and storage space. More precisely, every model of computation that has ever been imagined can compute only computable functions, and all computable functions can be computed by any of several models of computation that are apparently very different, such as Turing machines, register machines, lambda calculus and general recursive functions.

Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term &quot;effectively calculable&quot;. This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. The effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be &quot;efficiently&quot; computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially (or even superexponentially) with the length of the input. The fields of feasible computability and computational complexity study functions that can be computed efficiently.

The Blum axioms can be used to define an abstract computational complexity theory on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of determining the complexity of a computable function is known as a function problem.

==Definition==

Computability of a function is an informal notion. One way to describe it is to say that a function is computable if its value can be obtained by an effective procedure. With more rigor, a function formula_1
is computable if and only if there is an effective procedure that, given any -tuple formula_2 of natural numbers, will produce the value formula_3. In agreement with this definition, the remainder of this article presumes that computable functions take finitely many natural numbers as arguments and produce a value which is a single natural number.

As counterparts to this informal description, there exist multiple formal, mathematical definitions. The class of computable functions can be defined in many equivalent models of computation, including
* Turing machines
* μ-recursive functions
* Lambda calculus
* Post machines (Post–Turing machines and tag machines).
* Register machines

Although these models use different representations for the functions, their inputs, and their outputs, translations exist between any two models, and so every model describes essentially the same class of functions, giving rise to the opinion that formal computability is both natural and not too narrow. These functions are sometimes referred to as &quot;recursive&quot;, to contrast with the informal term &quot;computable&quot;, a distinction stemming from a 1934 discussion between Kleene and Gödel.p.6

For example, one can formalize computable functions as μ-recursive functions, which are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number (just as above). They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the constant, successor, and projection functions, and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the μ operator.

Equivalently, computable functions can be formalized as functions which can be calculated by an idealized computing agent such as a Turing machine or a register machine. Formally speaking, a partial function formula_1 can be calculated if and only if there exists a computer program with the following properties:
# If formula_3 is defined, then the program will terminate on the input formula_2 with the value formula_3 stored in the computer memory.
# If formula_3 is undefined, then the program never terminates on the input formula_2.

== Characteristics of computable functions ==

The basic characteristic of a computable function is that there must be a finite procedure (an algorithm) telling how to compute the function. The models of computation listed above give different interpretations of what a procedure is and how it is used, but these interpretations share many properties. The fact that these models give equivalent classes of computable functions stems from the fact that each model is capable of reading and mimicking a procedure for any of the other models, much as a compiler is able to read instructions in one computer language and emit instructions in another language.

Enderton [1977] gives the following characteristics of a procedure for computing a computable function; similar characterizations have been given by Turing [1936], Rogers [1967], and others.
* &quot;There must be exact instructions (i.e. a program), finite in length, for the procedure.&quot; Thus every computable function must have a finite program that completely describes how the function is to be computed. It is possible to compute the function by just following the instructions; no guessing or special insight is required.
* &quot;If the procedure is given a &quot;k&quot;-tuple x in the domain of &quot;f&quot;, then after a finite number of discrete steps the procedure must terminate and produce &quot;f&quot;(x).&quot; Intuitively, the procedure proceeds step by step, with a specific rule to cover what to do at each step of the calculation. Only finitely many steps can be carried out before the value of the function is returned.
* &quot;If the procedure is given a &quot;k&quot;-tuple x which is not in the domain of &quot;f&quot;, then the procedure might go on forever, never halting. Or it might get stuck at some point (i.e., one of its instructions cannot be executed), but it must not pretend to produce a value for &quot;f&quot; at x.&quot; Thus if a value for &quot;f&quot;(x) is ever found, it must be the correct value. It is not necessary for the computing agent to distinguish correct outcomes from incorrect ones because the procedure is defined as correct if and only if it produces an outcome.

Enderton goes on to list several clarifications of these 3 requirements of the procedure for a computable function:
# The procedure must theoretically work for arbitrarily large arguments. It is not assumed that the arguments are smaller than the number of atoms in the Earth, for example.
# The procedure is required to halt after finitely many steps in order to produce an output, but it may take arbitrarily many steps before halting. No time limitation is assumed.
# Although the procedure may use only a finite amount of storage space during a successful computation, there is no bound on the amount of space that is used. It is assumed that additional storage space can be given to the procedure whenever the procedure asks for it.

To summarise, based on this view a function is computable if:
The field of computational complexity studies functions with prescribed bounds on the time and/or space allowed in a successful computation.

== Computable sets and relations ==

A set of natural numbers is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable, total function such that for any natural number , if is in and if is not in .

A set of natural numbers is called computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function such that for each number , is defined if and only if is in the set. Thus a set is computably enumerable if and only if it is the domain of some computable function. The word &quot;enumerable&quot; is used because the following are equivalent for a nonempty subset of the natural numbers:
* is the domain of a computable function.
* is the range of a total computable function. If is infinite then the function can be assumed to be injective.
If a set is the range of a function then the function can be viewed as an
enumeration of , because the list will include every element of .

Because each finitary relation on the natural numbers can be identified with a corresponding set of finite sequences of natural numbers, the notions of computable relation and computably enumerable relation can be defined from their analogues for sets.

== Formal languages ==
In computability theory in computer science, it is common to consider formal languages. An alphabet is an arbitrary set. A word on an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet; the same symbol may be used more than once. For example, binary strings are exactly the words on the alphabet }. A language is a subset of the collection of all words on a fixed alphabet. For example, the collection of all binary strings that contain exactly 3 ones is a language over the binary alphabet.

A key property of a formal language is the level of difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language. Some coding system must be developed to allow a computable function to take an arbitrary word in the language as input; this is usually considered routine. A language is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable function such that for each word over the alphabet, if the word is in the language and if the word is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language.

A language is computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function such that is defined if and only if the word is in the language. The term &quot;enumerable&quot; has the same etymology as in computably enumerable sets of natural numbers.
==Examples==

The following functions are computable:

* Each function with a finite domain; e.g., any finite sequence of natural numbers.
* Each constant function &quot;f&quot; : N&quot;k&quot; → N, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;1...&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;) := &quot;n&quot;.
* Addition &quot;f&quot; : N2 → N, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;1,&quot;n&quot;&quot;2&quot;) := &quot;n&quot;1 + &quot;n&quot;2
* The greatest common divisor of two numbers
* A Bézout coefficient of two numbers
* The smallest prime factor of a number

If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are computable, then so are: &quot;f&quot; + &quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot; * &quot;g&quot;, formula_10 if
&quot;f&quot; is unary, max(&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;), min(&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;), and many more combinations.

The following examples illustrate that a function may be computable though it is not known which algorithm computes it.

* The function &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1 if there is a sequence of &quot;at least n&quot; consecutive fives in the decimal expansion of , and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0 otherwise, is computable. (The function &quot;f&quot; is either the constant 1 function, which is computable, or else there is a &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1 if &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0 if &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot;. Every such function is computable. It is not known whether there are arbitrarily long runs of fives in the decimal expansion of π, so we don&#x27;t know &quot;which&quot; of those functions is &quot;f&quot;. Nevertheless, we know that the function &quot;f&quot; must be computable.)
* Each finite segment of an &quot;un&quot;computable sequence of natural numbers (such as the Busy Beaver function Σ) is computable. E.g., for each natural number &quot;n&quot;, there exists an algorithm that computes the finite sequence Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(&quot;n&quot;) — in contrast to the fact that there is no algorithm that computes the &quot;entire&quot; Σ-sequence, i.e. Σ(&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;. Thus, &quot;Print 0, 1, 4, 6, 13&quot; is a trivial algorithm to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), Σ(3), Σ(4); similarly, for any given value of &quot;n&quot;, such a trivial algorithm &quot;exists&quot; (even though it may never be &quot;known&quot; or produced by anyone) to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(&quot;n&quot;).

==Church–Turing thesis==

The Church–Turing thesis states that any function computable from a procedure possessing the three properties listed above is a computable function. Because these three properties are not formally stated, the Church–Turing thesis cannot be proved. The following facts are often taken as evidence for the thesis:
* Many equivalent models of computation are known, and they all give the same definition of computable function (or a weaker version, in some instances).
* No stronger model of computation which is generally considered to be effectively calculable has been proposed.

The Church–Turing thesis is sometimes used in proofs to justify that a particular function is computable by giving a concrete description of a procedure for the computation. This is permitted because it is believed that all such uses of the thesis can be removed by the tedious process of writing a formal procedure for the function in some model of computation.

== Provability ==

Given a function (or, similarly, a set), one may be interested not only if it is computable, but also whether this can be &quot;proven&quot; in a particular proof system (usually first order Peano arithmetic). A function that can be proven to be computable is called provably total.

The set of provably total functions is recursively enumerable: one can enumerate all the provably total functions by enumerating all their corresponding proofs, that prove their computability. This can be done by enumerating all the proofs of the proof system and ignoring irrelevant ones.

=== Relation to recursively defined functions ===

In a function defined by a recursive definition, each value is defined by a fixed first-order formula of other, previously defined values of the same function or other functions, which might be simply constants. A subset of these is the primitive recursive functions. Another example is the Ackermann function, which is recursively defined but not primitive recursive.

For definitions of this type to avoid circularity or infinite regress, it is necessary that recursive calls to the same function within a definition be to arguments that are smaller in some well-partial-order on the function&#x27;s domain. For instance, for the Ackermann function formula_11, whenever the definition of formula_12 refers to formula_13, then formula_14 w.r.t. the lexicographic order on pairs of natural numbers. In this case, and in the case of the primitive recursive functions, well-ordering is obvious, but some &quot;refers-to&quot; relations are nontrivial to prove as being well-orderings. Any function defined recursively in a well-ordered way is computable: each value can be computed by expanding a tree of recursive calls to the function, and this expansion must terminate after a finite number of calls, because otherwise Kőnig&#x27;s lemma would lead to an infinite descending sequence of calls, violating the assumption of well-ordering.

=== Total functions that are not provably total ===

In a sound proof system, every provably total function is indeed total, but the converse is not true: in every first-order proof system that is strong enough and sound (including Peano arithmetic), one can prove (in another proof system) the existence of total functions that cannot be proven total in the proof system.

If the total computable functions are enumerated via the Turing machines that produces them, then the above statement can be shown, if the proof system is sound, by a similar diagonalization argument to that used above, using the enumeration of provably total functions given earlier. One uses a Turing machine that enumerates the relevant proofs, and for every input &quot;n&quot; calls &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (where &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;-th function by &quot;this&quot; enumeration) by invoking the Turing machine that computes it according to the n-th proof. Such a Turing machine is guaranteed to halt if the proof system is sound.

== Uncomputable functions and unsolvable problems ==
Every computable function has a finite procedure giving explicit, unambiguous instructions on how to compute it. Furthermore, this procedure has to be encoded in the finite alphabet used by the computational model, so there are only countably many computable functions. For example, functions may be encoded using a string of bits (the alphabet }).

The real numbers are uncountable so most real numbers are not computable. See computable number. The set of finitary functions on the natural numbers is uncountable so most are not computable. Concrete examples of such functions are Busy beaver, Kolmogorov complexity, or any function that outputs the digits of a noncomputable number, such as Chaitin&#x27;s constant.

Similarly, most subsets of the natural numbers are not computable. The halting problem was the first such set to be constructed. The Entscheidungsproblem, proposed by David Hilbert, asked whether there is an effective procedure to determine which mathematical statements (coded as natural numbers) are true. Turing and Church independently showed in the 1930s that this set of natural numbers is not computable. According to the Church–Turing thesis, there is no effective procedure (with an algorithm) which can perform these computations.

==Extensions of computability==

===Relative computability===

The notion of computability of a function can be relativized to an arbitrary set of natural numbers &quot;A&quot;. A function &quot;f&quot; is defined to be computable in &quot;A (equivalently A&quot;-computable or computable relative to &quot;A) when it satisfies the definition of a computable function with modifications allowing access to &quot;A&quot; as an oracle. As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation. This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of &quot;A&quot;. We can also talk about &quot;f&quot; being computable in &quot;g by identifying &quot;g&quot; with its graph.

===Higher recursion theory===

Hyperarithmetical theory studies those sets that can be computed from a computable ordinal number of iterates of the Turing jump of the empty set. This is equivalent to sets defined by both a universal and existential formula in the language of second order arithmetic and to some models of Hypercomputation. Even more general recursion theories have been studied, such as E-recursion theory in which any set can be used as an argument to an E-recursive function.

===Hyper-computation===
Although the Church–Turing thesis states that the computable functions include all functions with algorithms, it is possible to consider broader classes of functions that relax the requirements that algorithms must possess. The field of Hypercomputation studies models of computation that go beyond normal Turing computation.

<text>West Ruislip () is an interchange station on Ickenham High Road on the borders of Ickenham and western Ruislip in the London Borough of Hillingdon in Greater London, England, formerly in the county of Middlesex. It is served by London Underground and National Rail. On the London Underground, the station is the western terminus of the Central line&#x27;s West Ruislip branch and the next station towards east is Ruislip Gardens. It is also on the Chiltern Railways of the National Rail. The Central line and Chiltern Railways platforms and ticket office hall are managed by LU. 

The closest station on the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines is Ickenham, from this station.

==History==
The station was opened on 2 April 1906 as Ruislip &amp; Ickenham by the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (GW&amp;GCJR). The GW&amp;GCJR connected London and the Midlands via High Wycombe and provided an alternative route to the Great Central Railway&#x27;s (GCR&#x27;s) main line through Aylesbury, Harrow and Wembley which shared its route with the Metropolitan Railway.

Prior to the Second World War plans had been made for a number of extensions to the Central line. The London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s (LPTB&#x27;s) 1935-40 New Works programme included the extension of the Central line to run alongside the Great Western Railway (GWR) tracks from North Acton to South Ruislip and the GW&amp;GCJR tracks from there as far as Denham; the post-war introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt caused the extension to be cut back to West Ruislip. Had the Central line extension been completed as planned, the next station would have been Harefield Road. Preparatory work on this section had started just before the war and a section of trackbed constructed for the extension can be seen to the west of the road overbridge, beyond the buffer stops of the Central line tracks alongside the National Rail line.

The additional tracks were constructed by the GWR on behalf of the LPTB and on 30 June 1947, the first section of the western extension opened from North Acton to Greenford. On the same date the station name was changed to West Ruislip (for Ickenham).

Central line services began running from West Ruislip on 21 November 1948.

The station building was built by British Railways for London Underground and was not completed until the 1960s At about the same time the sub-title was omitted from the station name. Some Central line stations with older signage still show the longer name on the line diagrams on their platforms.

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.

The London Borough of Hillingdon announced in June 2011 that it would be lobbying Transport for London to have the Central line extended from West Ruislip to Uxbridge. Such a project would require a business case approved by TfL and the completion of signal upgrade work on the Metropolitan line.

==Services==
===National Rail===
National Rail services at West Ruislip are operated by Chiltern Railways.

The station&#x27;s weekday off-peak service pattern is unusual in that it&#x27;s served by trains at different frequencies in each direction. The station is served by one train per hour to London Marylebone and one train every two hours to . Services to and from London operate as stopping services calling at most stations. Additional services call at the station during the peak hours.

On weekends, the service is increased to hourly in each direction and northbound services are extended beyond High Wycombe to and from via .

===London Underground===
On the London Underground, West Ruislip station is the western terminus of the Central line and the next station on the line is Ruislip Gardens to the east. The typical off-peak London Underground service on the Central line is 9 trains per hour to and from Epping. During the peak hours, this is increased to up to 12 trains per hour to and from Debden, with up to 7 tph continuing to and from Epping.

==Present day==
West Ruislip station is aligned approximately east–west with the main station buildings on the road overbridge across the lines at the western end of the station. The station has four platforms; two each for London Underground and National Rail services. The London Underground tracks are south of the National Rail ones and operate from an island platform whilst the National Rail platforms are outside of their tracks. The National Rail platforms are also served by a separate station building north of the tracks and adjacent to the car park. In a legacy of the original scheme to continue the extension to Denham, the Central line tracks continue for a short distance beyond the station before ending at buffers. The intended alignment of the unbuilt tracks can be seen from the width of the unused railway land south of the existing tracks.

The Central line&#x27;s Ruislip depot is east of West Ruislip station, and has a connection via a shunting neck to the Network Rail westbound track west of the station to allow rolling stock and material deliveries. The depot also has a connection to the Uxbridge branch tracks of the Metropolitan and Piccadilly Lines which pass under the Central line east of West Ruislip; it is used only for empty stock movements and works train access. Two sidings west of the station to the north of the running lines provide layover facilities for works trains.

There are ticket barriers at the main entrance to the station, controlling access to the Central line platforms from the public highway and the pedestrian walkway linking the car park to the station. The Chiltern platforms can be reached from the car park walkway without tickets.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 278, U1 and U10 serve the station.

<text>Titanosaurs (or titanosaurians; members of the group Titanosauria) were a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs, including genera from all seven continents. The titanosaurs were the last surviving group of long-necked sauropods, with taxa still thriving at the time of the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. This group includes some of the largest land animals known to have ever existed, such as &quot;Patagotitan&quot;, estimated at long with a mass of , and the comparably-sized &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Puertasaurus&quot; from the same region.

The group&#x27;s name alludes to the mythological Titans of ancient Greek mythology, via the type genus (now considered a &quot;nomen dubium)&quot; &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;. Together with the brachiosaurids and relatives, titanosaurs make up the larger sauropod clade Titanosauriformes. Titanosaurs have long been a poorly-known group, and the relationships between titanosaur species are still not well-understood.

==Fossil record==

Due to the near-global distribution of titanosaurs during the Cretaceous, titanosaur fossils have been found on every continent, including Antarctica. However, titanosaurs have the least complete fossil record of any major sauropodomorph group. No complete titanosaur skeletons are known, and many species are only known from a few bones. Titanosaur skulls are especially rare. Though fragmentary cranial remains are known for several titanosaur genera, nearly complete skulls have been described for only four: &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot;, &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;, &quot;Sarmientosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tapuiasaurus&quot;. As is the case in most other sauropod groups, there are few titanosaur specimens with complete necks preserving all of the cervical vertebrae in sequence. Only three complete titanosaur necks are known: the holotype of &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot; and two undescribed specimens from Argentina. A fourth specimen, of an unidentified titanosaur from Brazil, preserves a nearly complete neck, with only the atlas, the tiny vertebra forming the joint between the skull and neck, missing. Only five titanosaur specimens preserve complete, articulated hind feet. This incompleteness is especially significant for giant titanosaurs, which are generally known from disarticulated and fragmentary remains.

Titanosaurs are one of the few groups of dinosaurs for which fossil eggs are known. The fossil site of Auca Mahuevo preserves a titanosaur nesting ground. Some titanosaur eggs have been found containing fossil embryos, which even preserve fossil skin. These fossil embryos are among the few titanosaur specimens to preserve complete skulls.

==Description==
Titanosauria have the largest range of body size of any sauropod clade, and includes both the largest known sauropods and some of the smallest. One of the largest titanosaurs, &quot;Patagotitan&quot;, had a body mass estimated to be , whereas one of the smallest, &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot;, had a body mass of approximately . Even relatively closely related titanosaurs could have very different body sizes, as the small rinconsaurs were closely related to the gigantic lognkosaurs. Fossils from perhaps the largest dinosaur ever found were discovered in 2021 in the Neuquén Province of northwest Patagonia, Argentina. It is believed that they are from a titanosaur. Some of smallest titanosaurs, such as &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot;, inhabited Europe, which was largely made up of islands during the Cretaceous, and were likely island dwarfs. Another taxon of tiny titanosaurs, &quot;Ibirania&quot;, lived a non-insular context in Upper Creaceous Brazil, and is an example of nanism resultant from other ecological pressures.

===Head and neck===
The heads of titanosaurs are poorly known. However, several different cranial morphologies are apparent. In some species, such as &quot;Sarmientosaurus&quot;, the head resembled that of brachiosaurids. In others, such as &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; and &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot;, the head resembled that of diplodocids. In some titanosaurs, the skull was especially diplodocid-like due to square-shaped jaws; the titanosaur &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot; is especially similar to the rebbachisaurid &quot;Nigersaurus&quot;. Titanosaurs had small heads, even when compared with other sauropods. The head was also wide, similar to the heads of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus,&quot; though somewhat more elongated. Titanosaurian nostrils were large (&quot;macronarian&quot;) and all had crests formed by the nasal bones. Their teeth were either somewhat spatulate (spoon-like) or like pegs or pencils, but were always very small.

Titanosaur necks were of average length for sauropods, and their tails were whip-like though not as long as in the diplodocids. While the pelvis was slimmer than some sauropods, the pectoral (chest) area was much wider, giving them a uniquely &quot;wide-legged&quot; stance. As a result, the fossilized trackways of titanosaurs are distinctly broader than other sauropods. Their forelimbs were also stocky, and often longer than their hind limbs. Unlike other sauropods, some titanosaurs had no digits, walking only on horseshoe-shaped &quot;stumps&quot; made up of the columnar metacarpal bones. Their vertebrae (back bones) were solid (not hollowed-out), which may be a reversal to more basal saurischian characteristics. Their spinal column was relatively flexible, likely making them more agile than other sauropods, though at the expense of rearing on their hind legs compared to the Diplodocoids. One of the most characteristic features shared by most titanosaurs were their procoelous caudal vertebrae, with ball-and-socket articulations between the vertebral centra.

===Torso and limbs===

The dorsal vertebrae of titanosaurs show multiple derived features among sauropods. Similarly to the Rebbachisauridae, titanosaurs lost the hyposphene-hypantrum articulations, a set of surfaces between vertebrae that prevent additional rotation of the bones. &quot;Andesaurus&quot;, one of the most basal titanosaurs, shows a normal hyposphene. The same area is reduced in &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; to only two ridges, and is fully absent in taxa like &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;. Both &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; bear similar intermediate &quot;hyposphenal ridges&quot;, which suggests they represent a more primitive form of dorsal vertebrae.

Sauropod hands already are highly derived from other dinosaurs, being reduced into columnar metacarpals and blocky phalanges with fewer claws. However, titanosaurs evolved the manus even further, completely losing the phalanges and heavily modifying the metacarpals. &quot;Argyrosaurus&quot; is the only titanosaur known to possess carpals. Other taxa like &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; show a reduction of phalanges to one or two bones. &quot;Opisthoeoclicaudia&quot; shows even more reduction of the hand than other titanosaurs, with both carpals and phalanges completely absent. However, &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot;, while lacking carpals, preserves a manual formula of , including a thumb claw and phalanges on all other digits. This, coupled with the preservation of a single phalanx on digit IV of &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; and potentially &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; (further study is necessary), show that preservation biases may be responsible for the lack of hand phalanges in these taxa. This suggests that &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot;, &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and &quot;Rapetosaurus -&quot; all known from imperfect or disarticulated remains previously associated with a lack of phalanges - may have had phalanges but lost them after death.

Titanosaurs have a poor fossil record of their pedes (feet), only being complete in five definitive titanosaurs. Among these, &quot;Notocolossus&quot; is the largest, and also has the most specialized pes: like all titanosaurs, its pes is composed of short, thick metatarsals of approximately the same lengths; however, metatarsals I and V are notably more robust than in other taxa.

===Integument===

From skin impressions found with fossils, it has been determined that the skin of many titanosaurs was armored with a small mosaic of small, bead-like scales surrounding larger scales. While most titanosaurs were very large animals, many were fairly average in size compared to other giant dinosaurs. Some island-dwelling dwarf titanosaurs, such as &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot;, were probably the result of allopatric speciation and insular dwarfism.

Some titanosaurs had osteoderms. Osteoderms were first confirmed in the genus &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; but are now known to have been present in a variety of titanosaurs within the clade Lithostrotia. The exact arrangement of osteoderms on the body of a titanosaur is not known, but some paleontologists consider it likely that the osteoderms were arranged in two parallel rows on the animal&#x27;s back, an arrangement similar to the plates of stegosaurs. Several other arrangements have been proposed, such as a single row along the midline, and it is possible that different species had different arrangements. The osteoderms were certainly far more sparse than those of ankylosaurs, and did not completely cover the back in scutes. Because of their sparse arrangement, it was unlikely that they served a significant role in defense. However, they may have played an important role in nutrient storage for titanosaurs living in highly seasonal climates and for female titanosaurs laying eggs. Osteoderms were present on both large and small species, so they were not solely used by smaller species as protection against predators. New evidence published in 2021 suggests there were indeed some defensive purposes in titanosaur osteoderms; simulated bite marks from both baurusuchid crocodylomorphs and abelisaurids on titanosaurid osteoderms suggest they could be useful for protecting the animals in addition to functioning in mineral storage.

==Classification==
Titanosaurs are classified as sauropod dinosaurs. This highly diverse group forms the dominant clade of Cretaceous sauropods. Within Sauropoda, titanosaurs were once classified as close relatives of Diplodocidae due to their shared characteristic of narrow teeth, but this is now known to be the result of convergent evolution. Titanosaurs are now known to be most closely related to euhelopodids and brachiosaurids; together they form a clade named Titanosauriformes.

For much of the 20th century, most known species of titanosaurs were classified in the family Titanosauridae, which is no longer in widespread use. Titanosauria was first proposed in 1993 as a taxon to encompass titanosaurids and their close relatives. It has been phylogenetically defined as the clade composed of the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and &quot;Andesaurus&quot; and all of its descendants. The relationships of species within Titanosauria remain largely unresolved, and it is considered one of the most poorly-understood areas of dinosaur classification. One of the few areas of agreement is that the majority of titanosaurs except &quot;Andesaurus&quot; and some other basal species form a clade called Lithostrotia, which some researchers consider equivalent to the deprecated Titanosauridae. Lithostrotians include titanosaurs such as &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Isisaurus&quot;, &quot;Malawisaurus&quot;, &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;.

===Early history===

&quot;Titanosaurus indicus&quot; was first named by British paleontologist Richard Lydekker in 1877, as a new taxon of dinosaur based on two caudals and a femur collected on different occasions at the same location in India. While it was later given a position as a sauropod within Cetiosauridae by Lydekker in 1888, he named the new sauropod family Titanosauridae for the genus in 1893, which included only &quot;Titanosaurus&quot; and &quot;Argyrosaurus&quot;, united by caudals, presacrals, a lack of pleurocoels and open chevrons. Following this, Austro-Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa reviewed reptile genera in 1928, and provided a short classification of Sauropoda, where he placed the Titanosaurinae (a reranking of Lydekker&#x27;s Titanosauridae) in Morosauridae, and included the genera &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Hypselosaurus&quot; and &quot;Macrurosaurus&quot; because they all had strongly procoelous caudals. German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene provided a significant revision of Titanosauridae the following year in 1929, where he reviewed the dinosaurs of Cretaceous Argentina, and named multiple new genera. Huene included multiple species of &quot;Titanosaurus&quot; from India, England, France, Romania, Madagascar and Argentina, &quot;Hypselosaurus&quot; and &quot;Aepisaurus&quot; from France, &quot;Macrurosaurus&quot; from England, &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; from United States, and &quot;Argyrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Laplatasaurus&quot; from Argentina. The material between them represented almost all regions of the skeleton, which showed they were derived sauropods Huene interpreted as closest to &quot;Pleurocoelus&quot; of the various non-titanosaurid genera.

For his 1986 thesis, Argentinian paleontologist Jaime Powell described and classified many new genera of South American titanosaurs. Using the family Titanosauridae to include them all, he grouped the genera into Titanosaurinae, Saltasaurinae, Antarctosaurinae, Argyrosaurinae and Titanosauridae indet. Titanosaurinae included &quot;Titanosaurus&quot; and the new genus &quot;Aeolosaurus&quot;, united by multiple features of the caudal vertebrae; the new clade Saltasaurinae was created to include &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and the new genus &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot;, united by very distinct dorsals, caudals, and ilia; the new clade Antarctosaurinae was created to include &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot;, distinguished by large size, a different form of braincase, more elongate girdle bones, and more robust limb bones; and Argyrosaurinae was created for &quot;Argyrosaurus&quot;, bearing a more robust forelimb and hand and more primitive dorsals. The new genus &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; was named for a more basal titanosaurid classified as Titanosauridae indet. along with unnamed specimens, &quot;Clasmodosaurus&quot; and &quot;Campylodoniscus&quot;.

John Stanton McIntosh provided a synopsis of sauropod relationships in 1990, using Titanosauridae as the group to contain all taxa like previous authors. &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; was placed in Opisthocoelicaudiinae within Camarasauridae, following its original description and not later works, and &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Quaesitosaurus&quot; were placed within Dicraeosaurinae. Titanosauridae included many previously named genera, plus taxa like &quot;Tornieria&quot; and &quot;Janenschia&quot;. &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; included the species previously known as &quot;Titanosaurus australis&quot; and &quot;T. robustus&quot;, which were named &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot; by Powell in 1986. McIntosh provided a large diagnosis of the family: &quot;dorsals with irregularly shaped pleurocoels and spines directed strongly backward; transverse processes directed dorsally as well as laterally, very robust in shoulder region; a second dorsosacral, its rib fused to ilium; caudals strongly procoelous with a prominent ball on distal end of centrum throughout tail; caudal arches on front half of centrum; sternal plates large; preacetabular process of ilium swept outward to become almost horizontal&quot;, but stressed that the relationships of titanosaurids to other sauropod groups couldn&#x27;t be determined due to a lack of cranial material.

A brief review of putative titanosaurids from Europe was authored by Jean Le Loeuff in 1993, and covered the supposed genera known so far. The Barremian (middle Early Cretaceous) species &quot;Titanosaurus valdensis&quot;, named decades previous by Huene, was kept as the oldest of the titanosaurid and given the new genus name &quot;Iuticosaurus&quot;. The French taxon &quot;Aepisaurus&quot; was removed from the family and placed in undetermined Sauropoda. &quot;Macrurosaurus&quot; was considered a chimaera of titanosaurid and non-titanosaurid material because of the presence of both procoelous and caudals. Huene&#x27;s species &quot;Titanosaurus lydekkeri&quot; was left as a nomen dubium, but left within Titanosauridae. Maastrichtian fossils from France and Spain were removed from &quot;Hypselosaurus&quot; and &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, with &quot;Hypselosaurus&quot; being declared dubious like &quot;T. lydekkeri&quot;. The variety of Romanian fossils named as &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot; by Huene were also moved into the same species again, &quot;M. dacus&quot; as originally named by Nopcsa.

===Titanosauria named===

José Bonaparte and Rodolfo Coria in 1993 concluded that a new clade of derived sauropods was necessary because &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Andesaurus&quot; and &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; were distinct from Titanosauridae as they possessed , but were still very closely related to the titanosaurids. The taxa that possessed the articulations were united within the new family Andesauridae, and the two families were grouped together within the new clade Titanosauria. The titanosaurs were diagnosed by possessing small centered within an anteroposteriorly elongate depression and the presence of two well defined depressions on the posterior face of the neural arch. The entire group was compared favourably with cetiosaurids like &quot;Patagosaurus&quot; and &quot;Volkheimeria&quot;.

Overlooking the naming of Titanosauria, Paul Upchurch in 1995 named the clade Titanosauroidea, to include &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; and the more derived Titanosauridae (&quot;Malawisaurus&quot;, &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;). United by: caudals with anteriorly-shifted neural spines, extremely robust forearm bones, a prominent concavity on the ulna for articulation with the humerus, a laterally flared and flattened ilium, and a less robust pubis; Upchurch considered the clade sister taxon to Diplodocoidea, because of their shared dental anatomy, although he noted that peg-like teeth might have been independently evolved. This was followed up by Upchurch&#x27;s 1998 study on sauropod phylogenetics, which additionally recovered &quot;Phuwiangosaurus&quot; and &quot;Andesaurus&quot; within Titanosauroidea and resolved &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; as the sister of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; instead of the most basal titanosauroid. This result places Titanosauroidea in a group with &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, although Nemegtosauridae (&quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Quaesitosaurus&quot;) was still classified as the basalmost family of diplodocoids. Upchurch chose to use Titanosauroidea as a replacement name for Titanosauria due to the recommended use of Linnean taxonomy and ranks.

In 1997, Leonardo Salgado &quot;et al.&quot; published a phylogenetic study on Titanosauriformes, including relationships within Titanosauria. They provided a definition for the clade of &quot;including the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Andesaurus delgadoi&quot; and Titanosauridae and all of its descendants&quot;. Titanosauria resolved including the same two subclades as Bonaparte &amp; Coria (1993), where Andesauridae was monotypic, only including the name genus, and Titanosauridae was all other titanosaurs. Titanosauria was additionally rediagnosed, with eye-shaped pleurocoels, forked infradiapophyseal , centro-parapophyseal laminae, procoelous anterior caudals, and a significantly longer pubis than ischium. Titanosauridae was less strongly defined because of the polytomy between &quot;Malawisaurus&quot; and &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot;, so some diagnostic features couldn&#x27;t be resolved. Saltasaurinae was defined as the most recent ancestor of &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot;, &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and its descendants, and diagnosed by short cervical , vertically compressed anterior caudals, and a posteriorly shifted anterior caudal neural spine.

Contributing additional work to the systematics of titanosaurs, Spanish paleontologist José Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; published an additional study in 1999, utilizing both the names Titanosauria and Titanosauroidea in displaying their results. Similar to Upchurch (1995), Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; recovered &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; as a titanosauroid outside Titanosauria, while Titanosauria was redefined to include only the taxa classified by their study. Eutitanosauria was proposed as a name for the titanosaurs more derived than &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot;, and noted the presence of osteoderms as a probable synapomorphy of this clade. &quot;Aeolosaurus&quot;, &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ampelosaurus&quot; and &quot;Magyarosaurus&quot; were looked at using their character list, but were considered too incomplete to add to the final study.

Argentinian paleontologist Jaime Powell published his 1986 thesis in 2003, with revisions to bring his old work up to date, including the addition of more phylogenetics and the recognition of Titanosauria as a clade name. Using the datamatrix of Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) and modifying it to include additional taxa and some character changes, Powell found that titanosaurs formed mostly a single gradual radiation beginning with &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; as the most basal titanosaur, and &quot;Ampelosaurus&quot; and &quot;Isisaurus&quot; as the most derived. Titanosauroidea (following Upchurch 1995), was distinguished by pre- and post-spinal laminae in anterior caudals, a laterally flared ilium, a lateral expansion of the upper femur, and strongly opisthocoelous posterior dorsals. Less inclusive, Titanosauria was diagnosed by horizontally facing dorsal , prominent procoelous anterior caudals, and a ridge on the sternal plates. Within Titanosauria, Eutitanosauria was characterized by the absence of a hyposphene-hypantrum, no femoral fourth trochanter, and osteoderms. A small clade of &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Lirainosaurus&quot; and the &quot;Peirópolis titanosaur&quot; (&quot;Trigonosaurus&quot;) was resolved, and diagnosed by only a rotation of the tibia so the proximal end is perpendicular to the distal end. More derived clades, while resolved, were only weakly supported, or characterized by reversions of diagnostic traits of larger groups (below and left).
Powell (2003)
Curry-Rogers &amp; Forster (2001)

&quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; was described in 2001 by Kristina Curry-Rogers and Catherine Forster, who additionally provided a new phylogenetic analysis of Titanosauriformes (above and right). Titanosauria was strongly supported, distinguished by up to 20 characters depending on unknown traits in basal taxa. Similarly, Saltasaurinae was characterised by up to 16 traits, and the clade of &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; and related taxa possessed four unique features. &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Quaesitosaurus&quot; were resolved within Titanosauria for the first time, after being placed in Diplodocoidea by multiple other analyses, because &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; provided the first significant titanosaur cranial material with associated postcrania. All three genera were resolved in a clade together, although Curry-Rogers &amp; Forster noted that it was possible the group was only resolved because no other titanosaurs had comparable cranial material. &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; was also nested deeply in Saltasaurinae, though a further investigation of titanosaur interrelationships was proposed.

American paleontologist Jeff Wilson presented another revision of overall sauropod phylogeny in 2002, resolving strong support for most groups, and a similar result to Upchurch (1998) although with &quot;Euhelopus&quot; closest to titanosaurs instead of outside Neosauropoda. More internal clades were resolved for Titanosauria, with &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; united within Nemegtosauridae, and Saltasauridae including two subfamilies, Opisthocoelicaudiinae and Saltasaurinae. Saltasauridae was defined as a node-stem triplet, where everything descended from the common ancestor of &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was within Saltasauridae, and the subfamilies Saltasaurinae and Opisthocoelicaudiinae were for every taxon on one branch of the saltasaurid tree or the other.

Wilson and Paul Upchurch followed this study up in 2003 with a significant revision of the type genus &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, and revisited all the material that had been assigned to the genus while reviewing titanosaur inter-relationships. Because they found &quot;Titanosaurus&quot; to be a dubious name, they proposed that Linnaean-named groups Titanosauridae and Titanosauroidea should be considered invalid as well. Wilson &amp; Upchurch (2003) supported the definition of Salgado &quot;et al.&quot; (1997) for Titanosauria, since it was oldest and most similar to the original content of the group when named by Bonaparte &amp; Coria (1993). Lithostrotia (Upchurch &quot;et al.&quot; 2004) was defined to be &quot;Malawisaurus&quot; and all more derived titanosaurs, and the clade Eutitanosauria (Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; 1999) was considered a possible synonym of Saltasauridae. Wilson &amp; Upchurch (2003) presented a reduced cladogram of Titanosauria, including only the most commonly-analyzed taxa from previous studies, resulting in a tree similar to that of Wilson (2002) but with &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; and &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; excluded and &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; included. &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; were united within Opisthocoelicaudiinae, &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; formed Saltasaurinae, and &quot;Isisaurus&quot; placed as the next most derived titanosaurid.

At the same time as Wilson &amp; Upchurch redescribing the species of &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, Saldago (2003) looked over the potential invalidity of the family Titanosauridae and redefined the internal clades of Titanosauria. Titanosauria was defined as more inclusive than Titanosauroidea, contrasting with earlier used by Upchurch (1995) and Sanz &quot;et al.&quot; (1999), as all taxa in Somphospondyli closer to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; than &quot;Euhelopus&quot;. In order to create additional stability, Saldago also defined Andesauroidea for only &quot;Andesaurus&quot;, as every titanosaur closer to that genus than &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;, and also it&#x27;s opposite Titanosauroidea as every titanosaur closer to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; than &quot;Andesaurus&quot;. Next most inclusive, Salgado revitalised Titanosauridae to include everything descended from the ancestor of &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;, and to replace the node-stem triplet of Saltasauridae, defined the clades Epachthosaurinae and Eutitanosauria as &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot;&gt;&quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;&lt;&quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; respectively. Saltasaurinae and Opisthocoelicaudiinae were retained with their original definitions, but Lithostrotia was considered a synonym of Titanosauridae, and Titanosaurinae was considered a paraphyletic clade of unrelated titanosaurids.

Following the clade definitions proposed in previous Salgado studies, Bernardo González-Riga published two papers in 2003 describing new taxa in Titanosauria: &quot;Mendozasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; (with Jorge O. Calvo). In both studies, the new taxa formed clades within Titanosauridae, although neither were named, and new diagnostic features were proposed for the family. For &quot;Mendozasaurus&quot;, the new genus grouped with &quot;Malawisaurus&quot; as basal within Titanosauridae, but because of the features of caudal vertebrae in these basal taxa, González-Riga recommended revising the diagnosis of the family, instead of changing the content. The situation of caudals in &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; also suggested procoelous caudals were no longer diagnostic, because in the tail of &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; the vertebrae regularly changed their articular surfaces, being from procoelous caudals interspersed with amphicoelous, opisthocoelous and biconvex vertebrae. &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; was then included in Aeolosaurini, a clade named the following year by Aldirene Franco-Rosas &quot;et al.&quot; containing everything closer to &quot;Aeolosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatitan&quot; than &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; or &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;. Only the three genera and various intermediate specimens were included in Aeolosaurini in their 2004 paper, with the tribe being considered to be within Saltasaurinae.

The second edition of &quot;The Dinosauria&quot;, published in 2004, included newly described titanosaurs and other taxa reidentified as titanosaurs. Written by Upchurch, Paul Barrett and Peter Dodson, a review of Sauropoda included a more expansive Titanosauria for sauropods more derived than brachiosaurids. Titanosauria, defined as everything closer to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; than &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, included a very large variety of taxa, and the new clade Lithostrotia was named for a large number of more derived taxa, although Nemegtosauridae was placed in Diplodocoidea following earlier publications of Upchurch. Lithostrotia adopted the distinguishing feature of strongly procoelous caudals, previously used for Titanosauria.

===New phylogenetic frameworks===
In 2005, Curry-Rogers proposed a new phylogenetic analysis that focused on the inter-relationships of Titanosauria and included the most expansive character and taxon list of any study before it. 364 characters were selected from all previous phylogenetic analyses and scored across 29 probable titanosaurs, ranging from the Late Jurassic African &quot;Janenschia&quot; to the large variety of Late Cretaceous global genera. Proposing her analysis as the basis for a new phylogenetic framework of Titanosauria, Curry-Rogers recommended only using named for clades that were very strongly supported. For the strict consensus, every taxon more derived than &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; was in an unresolved polytomy except for a clade of &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; and &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot;, and one of Saltasaurinae. Within the recommended results, she only named Titanosauria, Lithostrotia, Saltasauridae, Saltasaurinae and Opisthocoelicaudiinae, because of the weakness of support (below and left).

Another form of composite matrix was created by Calvo, González-Riga and Juan Porfiri in 2007, based upon multiple previous studies between 1997 and 2003. The final analysis included 15 titanosaurs and 65 characters, and the typical titanosaur subclades were resolved, Titanosauridae being used over Lithostrotia following Salgado (2003), and the new clade Rinconsauria for the clade of &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; and &quot;Muyelensaurus&quot;. The new clade (defined as &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot; and &quot;Muyelensaurus&quot;) was placed as the sister taxon of Aeolosaurini, which together grouped with &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; as sister to Saltasauridae. In the same year, Calvo &quot;et al.&quot; published another paper, describing the basal titanosaur &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot;. The only difference in the resulting phylogeny, based on the matrix of the Calvo, González-Riga &amp; Porfiri (2007), was the addition of &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot; as the sister taxon to &quot;Mendozasaurus&quot; in a clade Calvo &quot;et al.&quot; named Lognkosauria, defined by the two genera classified within it. A very similar result was also recovered by González-Riga &quot;et al.&quot; in 2009 in a phylogenetic analysis based partially on that of Calvo &quot;et al.&quot; (2007), although &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot; was nested with &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; outside the clades of aeolosaurines. Further updates and modifications were then made by Palbo Gallina &amp; Apesteguía in 2011, with the additions of &quot;Ligabuesaurus&quot;, &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot;, &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Bonitasaura&quot; and character updates to match, bringing the total to 77 characters and 22 taxa. Significantly contrasting the earlier results, internal relationships of Titanosauria were rearranged. &quot;Malawisaurus&quot; nested with &quot;Andesaurus&quot; in a clade of the basalmost titanosaurs outside Titanosauroidea, where &quot;Lirainosaurus&quot;, instead of being the basal member of the saltasaur-branch was instead basalmost titanosauroid. Lognkosauria moved to be within rinconsaurs, while Nemegtosauridae was resolved as the sister of &quot;Aeolosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatitan&quot;, and the rinconsaur-lognkosaur branch. &quot;Antarctosaurus&quot; was unstable, but placed in a polytomy with the lognkosaurs and rinconsaurs before being excluded. Saltasaurinae and its relationship with &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; remained the same.

Nemegtosauridae was additionally revised by Hussam Zaher &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) with the description of &quot;Tapuiasaurus&quot;, which nested closer to &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot; than &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot;, with all three forming a clade of derived lithostrotians. Using the matrix of Wilson (2002), following the additions of a few cranial characters and &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot;, &quot;Tangvayosaurus&quot; and &quot;Phuwiangosaurus&quot;, remained the same as originally found by Wilson but with &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot; sister to Saltasauridae and the other two genera as basal titanosaurs outside Lithostrotia, since Titanosauria, while undefined, was labelled to include all taxa closer to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; than &quot;Euhelopus&quot;. Following a revision of the skull of &quot;Tapuiasaurus&quot;, Wilson &quot;et al.&quot; (2016) rescored the analysis of Zaher &quot;et al.&quot; and recovered similar results for everything but Nemegtosauridae, where the family dissolved into a more basal &quot;Tapuiasaurus&quot; outside Lithostrota and &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; outside Saltasauridae. While non-titanosaur phylogeny remained identical in every single result, the topology within Titanosauria was very labile and prone to change with minor adjustments.

Also following the 2002 analysis of Wilson, José Carballido and colleagues published a redescription of &quot;Chubutisaurus&quot; in 2011, and utilized an updated Wilson matrix, expanded to 289 characters across 41 taxa, including 15 titanosaurs. The primary focus of the analysis was on the basal titanosauriform taxa, but Titanosauria was defined, as the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Andesaurus delgadoi&quot; and &quot;Saltasaurus loricatus&quot;, and all its descendants, although the only autapomorphy of the group recovered was the absence of a prominent ventral process on the scapula. This same matrix and basis of characters was further utilized and expanded for analyses on &quot;Tehuelchesaurus&quot;, &quot;Comahuesaurus&quot; and related rebbachisaurs, &quot;Europasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Padillasaurus&quot;, before being expanded upon once again in 2017 by Carballido &quot;et al.&quot; during the description of &quot;Patagotitan&quot; to 405 characters and 87 taxa, including 28 titanosaurs (above and right). The definition of Titanosauria was preserved following Salgado &quot;et al.&quot; (1997) as &quot;Andesaurus&quot; plus &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;. Eutitanosauria (closer to &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; than &quot;Epachthosaurus&quot;) was resolved as a very inclusive clade composed of two distinct branches, one leading to the larger-bodied lognkosaurs and the other to the smaller-bodied saltasaurs. On the lognkosaur branch of Eutitanosauria, there is a branch of lognkosaurs and one of Rinconsauria. Following Calvo, González-Riga and Porfiri (2007), Rinconsauria was defined as &quot;Muyelensaurus&quot; plus &quot;Rinconsaurus&quot;, and Lognkosauria was defined as &quot;Mendozasaurus&quot; plus &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot;. Rinconsauria included taxa typically found within Aeolosaurini as well, so Aeolosaurini was redefined as &quot;Aeolosaurus rionegrinus&quot; plus &quot;Gondwanatitan&quot; to preserve the original restricted content, otherwise the entire rinconsaur-lognkosaur branch would be classified within Aeolosaurini. Lithostrotia, Saltasauridae and Saltasaurinae had their definitions preserved from earlier studies, and included their typical content.

Philip Mannion and colleagues redescribed &quot;Lusotitan&quot; in 2013, creating a new analysis of 279 characters drawn from significant previous analyses by Upchurch and Wilson supplemented by other studies. 63 sauropods were included, focusing on non-titanosaurian sauropods, although 14 probable titanosaurs were included. Unique to Mannion &quot;et al.&quot;, continuous characters were distinguished in a run of the matrix, which resolved almost all of Somphospondyli within Titanosauria because of &quot;Andesaurus&quot; placing very basal in a large group of Andesauroidea. Titanosauroidea was tentatively retained as the opposite clade of titanosaurs, which included all other traditional titanosaurs, although it was noted because of the invalidity of &quot;Titanosaurus&quot;, Titanosauroidea should be considered an invalid name as well. While the original analysis didn&#x27;t focus on titanosaurs, it was utilised during the descriptions of &quot;Savannasaurus&quot; and &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot;, &quot;Yongjinglong&quot;, an osteology of &quot;Mendozasaurus&quot;, and redescribing &quot;Tendaguria&quot;. From these updates, an analysis of 548 characters and 124 taxa was published by Mannion &quot;et al.&quot; in 2019 for a redescription of &quot;Jiangshanosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dongyangosaurus&quot;, and additional revisions of &quot;Ruyangosaurus&quot; were made. No differentiation between continuous and discrete characters was made like performed by Mannion &quot;et al.&quot; (2013), but a large clade of Andesauroidea was still resolved with implied weights. Both redescribed Asian taxa, as well as &quot;Yongjinglong&quot;, previously considered derived titanosaurs related to Saltasauridae, were removed to outside the clade.
In the description of &quot;Mansourasaurus&quot;, Sallam &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) published a phylogenetic analysis of Titanosauria including the most taxa of any analysis of the clade. In an updated version of the analysis, with the taxon &quot;Mnyamawamtuka&quot; added, Gorscak &amp; O&#x27;Connor (2019) got similar results, with slightly different relationships within small clades.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet===
Fossilized dung associated with late Cretaceous titanosaurids from India has revealed phytoliths, silicified plant fragments, that offer clues to a broad, unselective plant diet. Besides the plant remains that might have been expected, such as cycads and conifers, discoveries published in 2005 revealed an unexpectedly wide range of monocotyledons, including palms and grasses (Poaceae), including ancestors of rice and bamboo, which has given rise to speculation that herbivorous dinosaurs and grasses co-evolved.

===Nesting===
A large titanosaurid nesting ground was discovered in Auca Mahuevo, in Patagonia, Argentina and another colony has reportedly been discovered in Spain. Several hundred female saltasaurs dug holes with their back feet, laid eggs in clutches averaging around 25 eggs each, and buried the nests under dirt and vegetation. The small eggs, about in diameter, contained fossilised embryos, complete with skin impressions. The impressions showed that titanosaurs were covered in a mosaic armour of small bead-like scales. The huge number of individuals gives evidence of herd behavior, which, along with their armor, could have helped provide protection against large predators such as &quot;Abelisaurus&quot;.

===Range===

The titanosaurs were the last great group of sauropods, which existed from about 136 to 66 million years ago, before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, and were the dominant herbivores of their time. The fossil evidence suggests they replaced the other sauropods, like the diplodocids and the brachiosaurids, which died out between the late Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous Periods.

Titanosaurs were widespread. In December 2011, Argentine scientists announced titanosaur fossils had been found on Antarctica—meaning that titanosaur fossils have been found on all continents. They are especially numerous in the southern continents (then part of the supercontinent of Gondwana). Australia had titanosaurs around 96 million years ago: fossils have been discovered in Queensland of a creature around long. Remains have also been discovered in New Zealand. One of the largest ever titanosaur footprints was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2016. One of the oldest remains of this group was described by Ghilardi et al. (2016). It was found from the Valley of the Dinosaurs, Paraíba state of Brazil, representing a 136-million-year-old subadult individual.

===Paleopathology===
&quot;Ibirania&quot;, a nanoid titanosaur fossil from Brazil suggests that individuals of various genera were susceptible to diseases such as osteomyelitis and parasite infestations. The specimen hails from the late cretaceous São José do Rio Preto Formation, Bauru Basin, and was described in the journal &quot;Cretaceous Research&quot; by Aureliano et al. (2021). Examination of the titanosaur&#x27;s bones revealed what appear to be parasitic blood worms similar to the prehistoric &quot;Paleoleishmania&quot; but are 10-100 times larger, that seemed to have caused the osteomyelitis. The fossil is the first known instance of an aggressive case of osteomyelitis being caused by blood worms in an extinct animal.

<text>William Gilbert (1799–1877), established Gilbert company, the manufacturer of sports equipment, in 1823. Gilbert had a boot and shoemakers shop on 19 High Street next to Rugby School and started making balls for the school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pig bladders. These balls were bigger and rounder than today&#x27;s balls, which made them easier to kick longer distances.

It is the shape of the pig&#x27;s bladder that is reputed to have given the rugby ball its distinctive oval shape although balls of those days were more plum shaped than oval. There was no specific size that all the balls were as it depended on how small or large the pig&#x27;s bladder was. In those early days William&#x27;s nephew James, who was famed for his extraordinary lung power, inflated the balls. It was not a job that was sought after, the pig&#x27;s bladder would be blown up while still in its very smelly ‘green state’, solely by lungpower, down the stem of a clay pipe which was inserted into the opening of the bladder.

If the pig was diseased, it was possible to develop lung diseases from blowing up the balls. The wife of Richard Lindon died from an infection caught from an infected pigs bladder. This spurred Lindon in the mid-1860s to pioneer the &quot;rubber bladder&quot;, the Brass Hand pump inflator and finally the advent of shape standardization.

The Rugby Football Union was formed in 1871, six years before William died. This led to the company experiencing rapid growth along with the explosion of the sport. When William died his nephew James Gilbert took over the Gilbert company, which was making 2,800 balls per year, and James eventually passed it on to his son. And he had another nephew named Daniel.

<text>Joshua Gros (born June 25, 1982) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a midfielder. Gros is the team coordinator for the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer team. He was hired on June 11, 2009, under head coach Piotr Nowak. Nowak coached Gros on the 2004 MLS Cup-champion D.C. United. Nowak had previously hired him as an assistant when he led the USA Olympic team to Beijing in 2008.

==Career==

===College===
Gros was born in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. He played college soccer at Rutgers University from 2000 to 2003. As a freshman, Gros started 15 matches and led the team with seven assists. Although he moved into a consistent starting role as a sophomore, he only registered three points, all on assists. Upon moving to the offensive midfield as a junior, Gros&#x27;s production increased sharply and he finished the year with six goals and one assist. Gros far bettered this as a senior, finishing the year with 16 goals and five assists, and was named the Big East offensive player of the year. He was also chosen to National Player of the Week on September 22, 2003, by College Soccer News. During his professional career, however, Gros gradually took on a more defensive role.

===Professional===
Gros was selected 34th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United, and immediately impressed during preseason, earning himself a spot on the regular season lineup. Gros intended to join the Marine Corps had he not made the team. However, he did make the team, and soon his work rate earned him a surprise spot in the D.C. starting lineup. Gros seized this opportunity. His excellent, determined play made him a starter for much of the year, playing midfield on either wing or left back. He finished the year with 21 starts and 2087 minutes, in which he scored a goal and notched four assists. Gros continued to start for United throughout the 2005 and 2006 seasons. In 2006, he was named an MLS All-Star and played the entire All-Star Game against Chelsea.

In the 2007 MLS season, Gros started and played in 21 games for United, despite having suffered numerous head traumas. Following the season, he announced his retirement as a result of his accumulated head injuries.

===International===
Gros earned his only cap with the U.S. national team in a 2–0 victory over Mexico on February 7, 2007.

==Personal life==
His nickname amongst D.C. United players was “The Sarge”.

After retirement from playing due to head trauma he initially trained and worked as a civil engineer. He worked on designing projects for the U.S. Navy and Air Force.

<doc id="1139358" wikidata="Q2568039" url="?curid=1139358" title="The Ruff and Reddy Show">
<text>The Ruff and Reddy Show (also known as Ruff and Reddy) is an American animated television series produced by H-B Enterprises for NBC. It has been referred to as the earliest original color Saturday-morning cartoon, following &quot;Mighty Mouse Playhouse&quot;, which was made up of theatrical shorts. This was the first series made by Hanna-Barbera. The series follows the adventures of Ruff (a smart and steadfast cat) and Reddy (a good-natured and brave—but not overly bright—dog). It was presented by Screen Gems, the television arm of Columbia Pictures. It premiered in December 1957 and ran for 156 episodes until April 1960, comprising three seasons total. It was repeated on NBC Saturday mornings from 1962 to 1963. In the late 1950s, it was sponsored by Post Consumer Brands.

Hanna and Barbera created &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot; for their cartoon studio, then named H-B Enterprises. The &quot;buddy&quot; theme had previously been explored in their &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; theatrical shorts, but unlike Tom and Jerry, Ruff and Reddy aren&#x27;t foes, but housemates and best friends. The series is notable as one of the earliest original animated television programs as well as a pioneer of the use of limited animation techniques for television (even though it was not the first production to use it).

==History==

===Background===
In 1957, the animation/director team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were terminated from an eighteen-year-long tenure at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer producing the animated &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Droopy&quot; theatrical short subjects. Their staff, composed of 110 inkers, painters, and animators, were also let go. MGM found it more profitable to continually re-release older cartoons than produce new ones. Hanna and Barbera remained a partnership and invested $30,000 out of pocket into a new venture, H-B Enterprises. The duo began work on storyboards featuring new characters, the first among them being Ruff (a cat) and Reddy (a dog). Hanna later equated their respective names with he and his partners&#x27; dispositions at the period in which they were created. They forged a deal with former MGM colleague George Sidney in which he received a small percentage of the new company in return for acting as a business representative. Sidney arranged for a meeting at Screen Gems, which had at the time been considering re-entering the animation business. Feeling confidence in the &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot; characters, the duo presented their proposal, along with a streamlined production budget, employing limited animation.

===Animation===

&quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot;, as one of the first original animated series produced for television, pioneered the technique of limited animation. Limited animation would require far fewer drawings, and, by extension, less inking and painting. This method was employed by necessity, as higher budgets had been the cause for the collapse of the theatrical cartoon business. Hanna, in a six-page memo, had attempted to convince his superiors at MGM to employ economized techniques in order to reduce the cost of their short films, but received no response. At that time, he had estimated a six-minute cartoon to cost $17,500 if it employed the limited animation technique (down from the $35,000 budget the duo received at MGM). When pitching to Screen Gems, Hanna had worked down the numbers to a much smaller $3,000, and the duo were very confident the company would respond with great excitement. Screen Gems appreciated the show concept, but explained to the duo that the budget for television, still an experimental medium, would be very stringent. Eventually, the company gave the partnership an option to produce five five-minute segments, with an escalating budget starting from $2,700.

Hanna described the process in his 1996 memoir, &quot;A Cast of Friends&quot;: &quot;It was essential that we select only the key poses necessary to convincingly impart the illusion of movement in our cartoons.&quot; This method often emphasizes close-ups, rather than full or medium shots. All in all, the production process for &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot; was not dissimilar from the process used to create theatrical cartoons: a script was written, followed by a storyboard illustrating key poses. Afterwards, a recorded soundtrack with dialogue was used to create a &quot;pose reel,&quot; which would give the filmmakers a sense of timing. Watching pose reels during their MGM years had emphasized that simple key poses would be enough to demonstrate humor. Hanna believed the process in line with the nature of television during the period, stressing &quot;intimacy rather than spectacle,&quot; represented an entirely different viewing experience (a large movie screen versus a small, standard-dimension television screen).

In addition to the quicker, cheaper production process, Hanna and Barbera made the decision to produce the segments in full color. &quot;It was one of the smartest things we did,&quot; Hanna said. &quot;We said, &#x27;Color will be here soon. Cartoons last forever. Let&#x27;s go ahead and do them in color, and we&#x27;ll be a jump ahead of the game.&#x27;&quot; This strategy paid off, as Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s following series continued to be reran after color television increased its prevalence in the late 1960s. &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot; also eschewed lavish, detailed background art for simple, colorful illustrations.

===Writing and music===
Hanna and Barbera were fond of the &quot;ongoing comedic rapport&quot; of cartoon duos, among them the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner and Sylvester the Cat/Tweety rivalries of Warner Bros. Cartoons. Their own creation at MGM, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, had been a variation on this theme. With &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot;, they decided to delete the nemesis theme and make the characters best friends instead. &quot;Consequently, this softer relationship placed a greater emphasis on the humor and wit conveyed to the audience through dialogue,&quot; wrote Hanna.

Hanna wrote the series&#x27; theme music, in his first foray into theme music composition, which would become a staple of Hanna-Barbera for nearly 30 years. His goal to capture the spirit of the characters while also catching the listeners&#x27; ear, he penned the lyrics one morning while storyboarding, handing off the sheet music to musical director Hoyt Curtin, who composed the melody. Unlike &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, the two new characters would speak, and the duo held auditions to find voice artists. Mainly selecting those they worked with at MGM, Hanna and Barbera decided to cast Don Messick as Ruff and Daws Butler as Reddy. Messick and Butler became the main long-time voice actors of H&amp;B cartoons. 

The series was set to be the opening and closing acts for a half-hour children&#x27;s program airing on Saturday mornings. While they had screened the pilot episode prior to broadcast, Hanna later admitted he was nervous as to how the public would respond. He writes in his book that reviews in trade papers were mainly positive, deeming it an &quot;entertaining and clever cartoon program.&quot; NBC, following this success, signed the duo to a five-year contract to produce and develop additional animated television series.

NBC paired the opening and closing episodes of the show (usually with a cliffhanger) with live segments and classic cartoons from the prior incarnation of Screen Gems, including &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.

<doc id="1139359" wikidata="Q5775610" url="?curid=1139359" title="History of Cheshire">
<text>The history of Cheshire can be traced back to the Hoxnian Interglacial, between 400,000 and 380,000 years BP. Primitive tools that date to that period have been found. Stone Age remains have been found showing more permanent habitation during the Neolithic period, and by the Iron Age the area is known to have been occupied by the Celtic Cornovii tribe and possibly the Deceangli.

The Romans occupied Cheshire for almost 400 years, from 70 AD, and created the town and fort of Deva Victrix, now Chester. After the Romans withdrew, Cheshire formed part of Mercia, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, that saw invasions from the Welsh and Danes. The Norman Conquest in 1070 saw Cheshire harshly ruled by the occupiers. Local people resented the invaders and rebelled. War again swept the county during the English Civil War in 1642, despite an attempt by local gentry to keep the county neutral.

The Industrial Revolution saw population changes in Cheshire as farm workers moved to the factories of Manchester and Lancashire. In the 18th and 19th centuries there was a resurgence in the country houses of Cheshire and canals and railways were built.

Contemporary Cheshire is now a ceremonial county administered by four unitary authorities; Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. (Warrington, formerly in Lancashire, was added to Cheshire in 1974.) Cheshire retains the offices of Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for ceremonial purposes.

==Toponymy==
Cheshire&#x27;s name was originally derived from an early name for Chester, and was first recorded as &quot;Legeceasterscir&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, meaning &quot;the shire of the city of legions&quot;. Although the name first appears in 980, it is thought that the county was created by Edward the Elder around 920. In the Domesday Book, Chester was recorded as having the name &quot;Cestrescir&quot; (Chestershire), derived from the name for Chester at the time. A series of changes that occurred as English itself changed, together with some simplifications and elision, resulted in the name Cheshire, as it occurs today.

==Prehistory==
Cheshire periodically lay under ice until the end of the Younger Dryas ice age about 11,500 years ago. However, primitive tools have been found that date to the Hoxnian Interglacial, between 400,000 and 380,000 years BP, showing that Cheshire was inhabited at that time, probably by Homo heidelbergensis.

There is evidence of Old Stone Age (Paleolithic) occupation with axe heads being found at Tatton dating to 10,000 B.C.
More permanent occupation of Cheshire occurred during the New Stone Age (Neolithic). For example, there is a chambered tomb known as the Bridestones, near Congleton. It belongs to the &quot;megalithic culture&quot; characterised by the practice of collective burial in stone-built chambers beneath mounds of earth and stone. It lies approximately three miles east of Congleton and is the oldest megalithic structure in the whole of Cheshire. Farming is also likely to have started to develop during the Neolithic period, with flint artefacts and burnt grain being found at Tatton dating to 2,600 B.C., and the Oversley Farm find.

During Bronze Age, occupation of upland hill sites at Beeston Castle and Eddisbury hill fort suggested a move to a more military society.

Into the Iron Age, Cheshire became occupied by the Celtic Cornovii, bordering the Brigantes to the North and the Deceangli and Ordovices to the West. The Cornovii tribe had their capital at The Wrekin, Shropshire and were known to trade in salt from mines at Middlewich and Northwich.

For the important Oversley Farm (near Manchester Airport) neolithic and Bronze Age longhouse find, see Oversleyford#Oversley Farm.

==Roman==

The Romans arrived in the lands of the Cornovii in 48 AD and defeated them at a battle at The Wrekin. By 70 AD the Romans had founded the fortress and town of Deva Victrix, now Chester, according to ancient cartographer Ptolemy, The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in Britannia built around the same time at York (Eboracum) and Caerleon (Isca Augusta); this has led to the suggestion that the fortress, rather than London (Londinium), was intended to become the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Superior. The civilian amphitheatre, which was built in the 1st century, could seat between 8,000 and 10,000 people. It is the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain, and is also a Scheduled Monument.

The Romans developed the settlements at Condate (Northwich) and Salinae (Middlewich) due to the importance as their salt mines Salt was very important in Roman society; and highly valued by the Roman occupation forces. Other Roman industries included smelting of lead at Runcorn and potteries at Wilderspool, though the county retained most of its rural character and native Britons tended more towards agriculture than industry.

Chester was garrisoned by the legion until at least the late 4th century. Although the army had abandoned the fortress by 410 when the Romans retreated from Britannia, the civilian settlement continued (probably with some Roman veterans staying behind with their wives and children) and its occupants probably continued to use the fortress and its defences as protection from raiders from the Irish Sea.

==Mercian==
The Roman Empire fell in the 5th century, and the Romano-British established a number of petty kingdoms in its place. The region was on the boundary of Northumbria, Mercia and north Wales so turbulent times continued. In 616, Æthelfrith of Northumbria defeated armies from the kingdoms of Powys and Gwynedd at the Battle of Chester and probably established the Anglo-Saxon position in the area from then on.

Later in the 7th century, Cheshire formed part of the kingdom of Mercia. However, with increased invasions from Danes, the Anglo-Saxons extended and strengthened the walls of Chester for protection. Chester was the centre of several battles between the English and Danes until eventually King Alfred, of Wessex and eventually Mercia, drove them away from the city in 894–895 and a peace treaty was agreed granting the Danes settlements in the Wirral, which can be seen by their Danish place names, such as Thingwall (from thing meaning &#x27;a meeting place&#x27;).

Alfred&#x27;s daughter Ethelfleda, &quot;Lady of the Mercians&quot;, built the new Anglo-Saxon &#x27;burh&#x27; at Chester.

By the middle of the 7th century, Christianity had also become widespread, and one of the earliest churches was at Eccleston. Eccleston shows signs of Christian burials as early as 390 AD, the earliest known Christian burials in Cheshire. Towards the end of the 7th century, Saint Werburgh founded a religious institution on the present site of Chester&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Church which later became the first cathedral.

By this time, the River Mersey is likely to have formed the natural boundary between Mercia and Northumbria. The threat was now from the Danish kingdom based at York, so the Mercian kingdom built a fort at Eddisbury in 914 to serve as a defence for Chester. All along the length of the River Mersey as far as Manchester, fortified defensive settlements were created, including Rhuddlan, Runcorn, Thelwall, Bakewell and Penwortham.

During his reign of Edward the Elder parts of old Derbyshire were also added to the Mercian kingdom. These are now modern-day Longdendale and Macclesfield. By 930, relative peace reigned across the area until the Norman occupation.

In 973, the &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that, two years after his coronation at Bath, King Edgar of England, came to Chester where he held his court in a palace in a place now known as Edgar&#x27;s field near the old Dee bridge in Handbridge. After the kings swore fealty and allegiance they rowed him back to the palace. As he entered he is reported to have said that with so many kings&#x27; allegiance his successors could boast themselves to be kings of the English.

Chester became headquarters of Eadric Streona in 1007, the King&#x27;s ealdorman of Cheshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire. This transferred to the governorship of the Earl of Mercia: firstly Leofric (c. 1030–1057); then Ælfgar (1057–1062); and finally Edwin (1062–1070).

Mercian place names can be seen throughout the county. They can be recognised by the suffix &#x27;ham&#x27; (from the Saxon word &#x27;hamm&#x27; meaning a settlement)-for example Frodsham, Eastham, Weaverham; and &#x27;burgh&#x27; or &#x27;bury&#x27; (meaning a fortified settlement or stronghold) such as Wrenbury and Prestbury.

==Norman==
William I led the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Confiscation of lands by the conquerors led to resistance and dissent for many years, and Cheshire, as a remote part of the kingdom, provided the Normans with stiff resistance. This led the Normans to treat Cheshire particularly harshly with land and villages being destroyed, crops burned and people made homeless.

In 1069 the final attempt at resistance was finally put down and Edwin and other Saxon landlords had their property confiscated and their land was passed to Norman lords. Edwin attempted another rebellion in 1071, but was betrayed and killed.

Proof of the devastation can be seen from the Domesday survey of 1086 most of the lands in Cheshire were recorded as &quot;wasta&quot;, or wasteland, as &quot;abandoned or useless lands&quot;. Prior to the conquest the lands had been fertile. Chester was sieged in 1070 and eventually sacked, largely demolished and devastated.

With control of the county, William built a castle in Chester at a defensive location overlooking the River Dee from where it could dominate and control the city and therefore administer the county. The old Roman walls were repaired making Chester probably one of the most heavily defended cities in Britain at that time.

William abolished the Earldom of Mercia and created a new Earldom of Chester. William made Hugh d&#x27;Avranches the first Earl. Hugh was nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or wolf, and ruled almost autonomously and with the full authority of the King. Cheshire was therefore declared a County palatine, a title it still holds today.

The county continued to be ruled and administered by Norman earls and they imposed their own courts of law, civil service and independent powers, until the 7th Earl, John, died without a male heir in 1237. By that time King Henry III had declared the female line of inheritance to be invalid and took back the title, passing it to his son, Prince Edward - later to become King Edward I. Ever since that time the eldest son of all English monarchs has held the title of Earl of Chester and the title was created in conjunction with the Prince of Wales. By the 13th century, so important were the city and castle at Chester regarded, that extensions were built to include a royal apartment for King Edward I during the various wars with the neighbouring Welsh.

Many other Norman castles were subsequently constructed throughout the county of Cheshire in order to maintain the peace and to exert control over the disenchanted population of the region who bitterly hated their Norman overseers for many generations.

 The Cheshire of 1086, as recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, was a larger county than it is today. With minor variations in spelling across sources, the complete list of hundreds of Cheshire at this time are: Atiscross, Bochelau, Chester, Dudestan, Exestan, Hamestan, Middlewich, Riseton, Roelau, Tunendune, Warmundestrou and Wilaveston.

It included two hundreds, Atiscross and Exestan, that later became part of North Wales, now principally Flintshire. At the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as Maelor Saesneg (which used to be a detached part of Flintshire). The area in between the Mersey and Ribble (referred to in the Domesday Book as &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot;) formed part of the returns for Cheshire. Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire, more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the River Mersey.

This period of uncertainty of the northern border lasted until 1182, when the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of Lancashire. Later, the hundreds of Atiscross and Exestan became part of Wales. Over the years the remaining ten hundreds consolidated to just seven with changed names: Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich, and Wirral.

Markets had existed in Chester, Middlewich and Nantwich well before 1066, and the suffix &quot;port&quot; (meaning &quot;market&quot;) suggests the likelihood in pre-Norman markets at towns like Stockport. However the 12th and 13th centuries saw an escalation of towns being granted market rights, probably as the local population grew more used to Norman rule. Aldford and Alderley markets were created in 1253; Macclesfield in 1261; Congleton in 1272 and Over in 1280. However competition was fierce and markets are known to have failed at Aldford, Coddington, Brereton and Burton before the start of the 14th century.

In 1397 the county had lands in the march of Wales added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the &quot;Cheshire Guard&quot;. As a result, the King&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester&quot;. No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard&#x27;s fall in 1399.

==17th century==
 By the early 17th century, Cheshire had established its own gentry descended from the Normans stock. These families dominated trade, legal and community affairs and of course dominated land ownership.

However, the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 changed this. People aligned with either the Royalist or Parliamentarian causes regardless of social status, but more due to their own conscience. Chester was a Royalist stronghold, while the market towns of Stockport, Knutsford, Nantwich, Congleton, Middlewich and Northwich remained in Parliamentarian hands. After initial skirmishes in 1642, there was an attempt by Cheshire gentry to keep the county neutral during the civil war. The Bunbury Agreement was agreed locally, but the strategic position of Cheshire and the port of Chester meant that national commanders could never accept the local neutrality and the forces ended up clashing in the First Battle of Middlewich in March 1643. The county saw many battles fought on its lands — notably, the sieges of Nantwich and Chester.

In August 1655, England was placed under military rule and Cheshire, Lancashire and North Staffordshire were governed by Charles Worsley. Riots were planned, even by Parliamentarians, notably Sir George Booth of Dunham Massey near Altrincham, though these were quashed and the leaders executed. Eventually military rule ended in 1658 and the monarchy was restored with King Charles II of England.

In 1689, Henry, Duke of Norfolk, raised a regiment on the little Roodee in Chester in an effort to resist any attempt by James II to re-take the English throne. This regiment became the Cheshire Regiment and now forms part of the &quot;1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire)&quot;.

==18th and 19th centuries==
At the end of the 18th century, land enclosure and district reorganisations took place. As well as local industries, industrialisation of the Lancashire and Manchester mill towns saw Cheshire farms abandoned as workers sought a better living in the industrial towns. These lands were absorbed into bigger estates culminating in 98% of Cheshire land belonging to only 26% of the population. For example, by 1870 Peckforton Castle was over .

However, industrialisation also bought benefits to Cheshire. The completion of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777 and innovations such as the Anderton Boat Lift, allowed Cheshire cheese and salt to become major county exports. Also the silk industry was developing in Macclesfield, triggered by Charles Roe building a watermill in Macclesfield in 1744.

Cheshire continued to develop into a wealthy county in the 19th century. Tatton Hall and Dunham Massey are examples of country houses developed during the period. The Egerton family extensively remodelled Tatton Hall between 1760 and 1820, and the 17th-century house at Dunham Massey saw significant 19th century development and expansion.

The railways came through Cheshire in the 1830s. The Grand Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament in 1833 and designed by George Stephenson and Joseph Locke. It opened for business on 4 July 1837, running for from Birmingham through Wolverhampton, Stafford, Crewe, Hartford and Warrington, then via the existing Warrington and Newton Railway to join the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at a triangular junction at Newton Junction. The GJR established its chief engineering works at Crewe, moving there from Edge Hill, in Liverpool.
In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington near Northwich and started manufacturing soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt as a main raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce &quot;limebeds&quot;. This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable.
Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; (1887) described Cheshire&#x27;s industry:

The 19th century also saw the creation of formal civic organisations in Cheshire. Cheshire Constabulary was founded in 1857 and Cheshire County Council was created in 1889.

==20th and 21st centuries==
Through the Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, some areas in the north-west became part of the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Stockport (previously a county borough), Hyde, Dukinfield and Stalybridge in the north-east became part of Greater Manchester. Much of the Wirral Peninsula in the north-west, including the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, joined Merseyside. At the same time the Tintwistle Rural District was transferred to Derbyshire. The area of Lancashire south of the Merseyside/Greater Manchester area, including Widnes and the county borough of Warrington, was added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire.

Halton and Warrington became unitary authorities independent of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 1998, but remain part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes and also for fire and policing.

A referendum for a further local government reform connected with an elected regional assembly was planned for 2004, but was abandoned – see Northern England referendum, 2004.

As part of the local government restructuring in April 2009, Cheshire County Council and the Cheshire districts were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities, Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester. The existing unitary authorities of Halton and Warrington were not affected by the change.

Cheshire is now a ceremonial county administered by four unitary authorities; Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. Cheshire retains the offices of Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for ceremonial purposes under the Lieutenancies Act 1997. Policing and fire and rescue services continue to be provided across all four areas together, with the Cheshire Police Authority and Cheshire Fire Authority consisting of members of the four councils.

The boundary of the Church of England Diocese of Chester follows most closely the pre-1974 county boundary of Cheshire, so it includes all of Wirral, Stockport, and the Cheshire panhandle that included Tintwistle Rural District council area. In terms of Roman Catholic church administration, most of Cheshire falls into the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury.

<doc id="1139372" wikidata="Q3404745" url="?curid=1139372" title="History of Cornwall">
<text>The history of Cornwall goes back to the Paleolithic, but in this period Cornwall only had sporadic visits by groups of humans. Continuous occupation started around 10,000 years ago after the end of the last ice age. When recorded history started in the first century BCE, the spoken language was Common Brittonic, and that would develop into Southwestern Brittonic and then the Cornish language. Cornwall was part of the territory of the tribe of the Dumnonii that included modern-day Devon and parts of Somerset. After a period of Roman rule, Cornwall reverted to rule by independent Romano-British leaders and continued to have a close relationship with Brittany and Wales as well as southern Ireland, which neighboured across the Celtic Sea. After the collapse of Dumnonia, the remaining territory of Cornwall came into conflict with neighbouring Wessex.

By the middle of the ninth century, Cornwall had fallen under the control of Wessex, but it kept its own culture. In 1337, the title Duke of Cornwall was created by the English monarchy, to be held by the king&#x27;s eldest son and heir. Cornwall, along with the neighbouring county of Devon, maintained Stannary institutions that granted some local control over its most important product, tin, but by the time of Henry VIII most vestiges of Cornish autonomy had been removed as England became an increasingly centralised state under the Tudor dynasty. Conflicts with the centre took place with the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 and Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549.

By the end of the 18th century, Cornwall was administered as an integral part of the Kingdom of Great Britain along with the rest of England and the Cornish language had gone into steep decline. The Industrial Revolution brought huge change to Cornwall, as well as the adoption of Methodism among the general populace, turning the area nonconformist. Decline of mining in Cornwall resulted in mass emigration overseas and the Cornish diaspora, as well as the start of the Celtic Revival and Cornish revival which resulted in the beginnings of Cornish nationalism in the late 20th century.

Cornwall&#x27;s Early Medieval history, in particular the early Welsh and Breton references to a Cornish King named Arthur, have featured in such legendary works as Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, predating the Arthurian legends of the Matter of Britain (see the list of legendary rulers of Cornwall).

==Pre-Roman Cornwall==

===Stone Age===
Cornwall was only sporadically occupied during the Palaeolithic, but people returned around 10,000 years ago in the Mesolithic, after the end of the last ice age. There is substantial evidence of occupation by hunter gatherers in this period.

The upland areas of Cornwall were the parts first open to settlement as the vegetation required little in the way of clearance: they were perhaps first occupied in Neolithic times (Palaeolithic remains are almost non-existent in Cornwall). Many megaliths of this period exist in Cornwall and prehistoric remains in general are more numerous in Cornwall than in any English county except Wiltshire. The remains are of various kinds and include menhirs, barrows and hut circles.

===Bronze Age===

Cornwall and neighbouring Devon had large reserves of tin, which was mined extensively during the Bronze Age by people associated with the Beaker culture. Tin is necessary to make bronze from copper, and by about 1600 BCE the West Country was experiencing a trade boom driven by the export of tin across Europe. This prosperity helped feed the skilfully wrought gold ornaments recovered from Wessex culture sites. Ingots of tin, some recovered from shipwrecks dated to the 12th century BCE off the coast of modern Israel, were analysed isotopically and found to have originated in Cornwall.

There is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural practices around the 12th century BCE that some scholars think may indicate an invasion or migration into southern Britain.

===Iron Age===

Around 750 BCE the Iron Age reached Britain, permitting greater scope of agriculture through the use of new iron ploughs and axes. The building of hill forts also peaked during the British Iron Age. During broadly the same time (900 to 500 BCE), Celtic cultures and peoples spread across the British Isles.

During the British Iron Age Cornwall, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by Celts known as the Britons. The Celtic language spoken at the time, Common Brittonic, eventually developed into several distinct tongues, including Cornish.

The first account of Cornwall comes from the Sicilian Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (c. 90 BCE – c. 30 BCE), supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century BCE geographer Pytheas, who had sailed to Britain:

Claims have been made that the Phoenicians traded directly with Cornwall for tin. There is no archaeological evidence for this and modern historians have debunked earlier antiquarian constructions of &quot;the Phoenician legacy of Cornwall&quot;, including belief that the Phoenicians even settled Cornwall.

===Toponymy===
By the time that Classical written sources appear, Cornwall was inhabited by tribes speaking Celtic languages. The ancient Greeks and Romans used the name &quot;Belerion&quot; or &quot;Bolerium&quot; for the south-west tip of the island of Britain, but the late-Roman source for the Ravenna Cosmography (compiled about 700 CE) introduces a place-name &quot;Puro coronavis&quot;, the first part of which seems to be a misspelling of &quot;Duro&quot; (meaning Fort). This appears to indicate that the tribe of the Cornovii, known from earlier Roman sources as inhabitants of an area centred on modern Shropshire, had by about the 5th century established a power-base in the south-west (perhaps at Tintagel).

The tribal name is therefore likely to be the origin of &quot;Kernow&quot; or later &quot;Curnow&quot; used for Cornwall in the Cornish language. John Morris suggested that a contingent of the Shropshire Cornovii was sent to South West Britain at the end of the Roman era, to rule the land there and keep out the invading Irish, but this theory was dismissed by Professor Philip Payton in his book &quot;Cornwall: A History&quot;. Given the geographical separation between the three tribes known as Cornovii–the third being found in modern-day Caithness– and the absence of any known connection, the Cornish Cornovii are generally assumed to compose a completely separate tribe. While their name may derive from their inhabitation of a peninsula, the absence of a peninsula in the other two cases has led to the postulation of a derivation from these tribes&#x27; worship of a &quot;horned god.&quot;

The English name, Cornwall, comes from the Celtic name, to which the Old English word &quot;Wealas&quot; &quot;foreigner&quot; is added.

In pre-Roman times, Cornwall was part of the kingdom of Dumnonia, and was later known to the Anglo-Saxons as &quot;&quot;West&quot; Wales&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;North Wales&quot; (modern-day Wales).

==Roman Cornwall==
During the time of Roman dominance in Britain, Cornwall was rather remote from the main centres of Romanisation. The Roman road system extended into Cornwall, but the only known significant Roman sites are three forts:- Tregear near Nanstallon was discovered in early 1970s, the other two found more recently at Restormel Castle, Lostwithiel (discovered 2007) and a fort near to St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Calstock (discovered early in 2007). A Roman style villa was found at Magor Farm near Camborne.

Pottery and other evidence suggesting the presence of an ironworks have been found at the undisclosed location near St Austell, Cornwall. Experts say the discovery challenges the belief that Romans did not settle in the county and stopped in east Devon where Isca Dumnoniorum became a flourishing provincial capital of the Dumnonii. Prof. Barry Cunliffe notes that &quot;in the south-west peninsula of Devon and Cornwall the lack of Romanization, after a brief military occupation in the first century, is particularly striking. West of Exeter the native socio-economic system simply continued unhindered&quot;.
Only a few Roman milestones have been found in Cornwall; two have been recovered from around Tintagel in the north, one at Mynheer Farm near the hill fort at Carn Brea, Redruth, another two close to St Michael&#x27;s Mount, one of which is preserved at Breage Parish Church, and one in St Hilary&#x27;s Church, St Hilary (Cornwall). The stone at Tintagel Parish Church bears an inscription to Imperator Caesar Licinius, and the other stone at Trethevy is inscribed to the Imperial Caesars Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus. According to Léon Fleuriot, however, Cornwall remained closely integrated with neighbouring territories by well-travelled sea routes. Fleuriot suggests that an overland route connecting Padstow with Fowey and Lostwithiel served, in Roman times, as a convenient conduit for trade between Gaul (especially Armorica) and the western parts of the British Isles.

Archaeological sites at Chysauster Ancient Village and Carn Euny in West Penwith and the Isles of Scilly demonstrate a uniquely Cornish &#x27;courtyard house&#x27; architecture built in stone of the Roman period, entirely distinct from that of southern Britain, yet with parallels in Atlantic Ireland, North Britain and the Continent, and influential on the later development of stone-built fortified homesteads known in Cornwall as &quot;Rounds&quot;.

==Post-Roman and Medieval periods==


In the wake of the Roman withdrawal from Great Britain in about 410, Saxons and other Germanic peoples were able to conquer and settle most of the east of the island over the next two centuries. In the west, Devon and Cornwall held out as the British kingdom of Dumnonia.

Dumnonia had close cultural contacts with Christian Ireland, Wales, Romano-Celtic Brittany and Byzantium via the West Atlantic trade network, and there is exceptional archaeological evidence for Late Antique trading contacts at the stronghold of Tintagel in Cornwall. The Breton language is closer to Cornish than to Welsh, showing the close contacts between the areas.

===Relationship with Wessex===
The early kings of Wessex are notable for the possible prevalence of Brythonic names among them and therefore care should be exercised in assuming a stark ethnic antipathy between emergent &#x27;British&#x27; and &#x27;English&#x27; identities, peoples and culture; rather a struggle for dominance of warring elites more or less aligned with eastern &#x27;Germanic&#x27; and western &#x27;Romano-Celtic&#x27; cultures and peoples. Atlantic Brythons were often recorded in alliance with Scandinavian forces such as the Danes, or Normans in Brittany, up to the period of the Norman Conquest.

In the early eighth century, Cornwall was probably a sub-division of Dumnonia, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 710, Geraint, king of Dumnonia, fought against Ine, king of Wessex. The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; states that in 722, the Battle of Hehil &quot;among the Cornishmen&quot; was won by the Britons. In the view of the historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, this probably indicates that Dumnonia had fallen by 722, and that the British victory of that year against Wessex secured the survival of the new kingdom of Cornwall for another one hundred and fifty years. There were intermittent battles between Wessex and Cornwall for the rest of the eighth century, and Cuthred, king of Wessex, fought against the Cornish in 743 and 753.

However, according to John Reuben Davies, Dumnonia ceased to exist around the beginning of the ninth century, but:
:The kingdom of Cornwall, on the other hand, remained as an independent British territory in the face of pressure from Wessex, cut off from fellow Brittonic-speakers in Wales and Brittany by the sea and the West Saxons.

In 814, King Egbert of Wessex ravaged Cornwall &quot;from the east to the west&quot;, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 825 the Cornish fought the men of Devon. In 838 the Cornish in alliance with Vikings were defeated by the West Saxons at the Battle of Hingston Down. This was the last recorded battle between Cornwall and Wessex, and possibly resulted in the loss of Cornish independence. In 875, the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; record that king Dungarth of Cornwall drowned, yet Alfred the Great had been able to go hunting in Cornwall a decade earlier suggesting Dungarth was likely an under-king. Kenstec (c.833-c.870) became the first bishop of Cornwall to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in the same period the bishop of Sherborne was instructed to visit Cornwall annually to &quot;root out the errors of the Cornish Church&quot;, further indications that Cornwall was becoming subject to Wessex in the middle of the ninth century. In the 880s Alfred the Great was able to leave estates in Cornwall in his will.

William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, says that in about 927, King Æthelstan of England expelled the Cornish from Exeter and fixed Cornwall&#x27;s eastern boundary at the River Tamar. T. M. Charles-Edwards dismisses William&#x27;s account as an &quot;improbable story&quot; on the ground that Cornwall was by then firmly under English control. John Reuben Davies sees the expedition as the suppression of a British uprising, which was followed by the confinement of the Cornish beyond the Tamar and the creation of a separate bishopric for Cornwall. Although English kings granted land in the eastern part in the ninth century, no grants are recorded in the western half until the mid-tenth century.

Cornwall now acquired Anglo-Saxon administrative features such as the hundred system. Unlike Devon, Cornwall&#x27;s culture was not anglicised. Most people still spoke Cornish, and place-names are still mainly Brittonic. In 944 Æthelstan&#x27;s successor, Edmund I, styled himself &#x27;King of the English and ruler of this province of the Britons&#x27;.

The antiquarian William Camden wrote in his book &quot;Britannia&quot; in 1607:
:As for those Cornwallians, although they stoutly bent all their force together in defence of their Countrey, yet soone became they subject to the Saxons, as who neither matched then in number, neither was their Countrey sufficiently fenced by nature to defend them.

===The Cornish Church===

The first centuries after the Romans left are known as the Age of the Saints in Celtic Christianity, and a revival of Celtic art spread from Ireland, Wales and Scotland into Great Britain, Brittany, and beyond. According to tradition the area was evangelised in the 5th and 6th centuries by the children of Brychan Brycheiniog and saints from Ireland. Cornish saints such as Piran, Meriasek, or Geraint exercised a religious and arguably political influence; they were often closely connected to the local civil rulers and in some cases were kings themselves. There was an important monastery at Bodmin and sporadically, Cornish bishops are named in various records.
By the 880s more Saxon priests were being appointed to the Church in Cornwall and they controlled some church estates like Polltun, Caellwic and Landwithan (Pawton, in St Breock or Pillaton in east Cornwall); perhaps Celliwig (Kellywick in Egloshayle or possibly Callington (formally Kellywick)); and Lawhitton. Eventually they passed these over to Wessex kings. However, according to Alfred the Great&#x27;s will the amount of land he owned in Cornwall was very small. West of the Tamar Alfred the Great only owned a small area in the Stratton region, plus a few other small estates around Lifton on Cornish soil east of the Tamar). These were provided to him through the Church whose Canterbury appointed priesthood was increasingly English dominated.

The early organisation and affiliations of the Church in Cornwall are unclear, but in the mid-9th century it was led by a Bishop Kenstec with his see at &quot;Dinurrin&quot;, a location which has sometimes been identified as Bodmin and sometimes as Gerrans. Kenstec acknowledged the authority of Ceolnoth, bringing Cornwall under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 920s or 930s King Athelstan established a bishopric at St Germans to cover the whole of Cornwall, which seems to have been initially subordinated to the see of Sherborne but emerged as a full bishopric in its own right by the end of the 10th century. The first few bishops here were native Cornish, but those appointed from 963 onwards were all English. From around 1027, the see was held jointly with that of Crediton, and in 1050, they were merged to become the diocese of Exeter.

===The 11th century===

In 1013 Wessex was conquered by a Danish army under the leadership of the Viking leader and King of Denmark Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn annexed Wessex to his Viking empire which included Denmark and Norway. He did not, however, annex Cornwall, Wales and Scotland, allowing these &quot;client nations&quot; self-rule in return for an annual payment of tribute or &quot;danegeld&quot;. Between 1013 and 1035 Cornwall, Wales, much of Scotland and Ireland were not included in the territories of King Canute the Great.

The chronology of English expansion into Cornwall is unclear, but it had been absorbed into England by the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), when it apparently formed part of Godwin&#x27;s and later Harold&#x27;s earldom of Wessex. The records of Domesday Book show that by this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, the largest of whom was Harold Godwinson himself.

The Cornish language continued to be spoken, particularly in west and mid Cornwall, and evolved a number of characteristics that began to separate it from its descendant language of Breton. The latter also went through evolution over the centuries, however they remain exceedingly similar. As well, Cornwall showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of Saxon Wessex and places continued, even after 1066, to be named in the Celtic Cornish tradition. Mills argues that the Breton rulers of Cornwall, as allies of the Normans, brought about an &#x27;Armorican Return&#x27; with Cornu-Breton retaining its status as a prestige language.

===Post Norman conquest (1066–1485)===
Legend has it that Condor, a survivor of the Cornish royal line, was kept as the first Earl of Cornwall by William the Conqueror following the Norman conquest of England. In 1068 Brian of Brittany, son of Eudes, Count of Penthièvre, was created Earl of Cornwall, and naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas suggests that many other post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans, the Bretons being descended from Britons who had fled to what is today France during the early years of the Anglo-Saxon conquest. and further proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as Béroul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition. Earl Brian defeated a second raid in the southwest of England, launched from Ireland by Harold&#x27;s sons in 1069. Brian was granted lands in Cornwall but by 1072 he had probably returned to Brittany: he died without issue.

Much of the land in Cornwall was seized and transferred into the hands of a new Norman aristocracy, with the lion&#x27;s share going to Robert, Count of Mortain, half-brother of King William and the largest landholder in England after the king. Some land was held by King William and by existing monasteries – the remainder by the Bishop of Exeter, and a single manor each by Judhael of Totnes and Gotshelm (brother of Walter de Claville).

Robert became Earl in succession to Brian; nothing is known of Cadoc apart from what William Worcester says four centuries later. Four Norman castles were built in east Cornwall at different periods, at Launceston, Trematon, Restormel and Tintagel. A new town grew up around Launceston castle and this became the capital of the county. On several occasions over the following centuries noblemen were created Earl of Cornwall, but each time their line soon died out and the title lapsed until revived for a new appointee. In 1336, Edward, the Black Prince was named Duke of Cornwall, a title that has been awarded to the eldest son of the Sovereign since 1421.

A popular Cornish literature, centred on the religious-themed mystery plays, emerged in the 14th century (see Cornish literature) based around Glasney College—the college established by the Bishop of Exeter in the 13th century.

It has been claimed as one of the great ironies of history that three Cornish-speaking Cornishmen brought the English language back from the verge of extinction – John of Cornwall, John Trevisa and Richard Pencrych.

John of Trevisa was a Cornish cleric instrumental in translation of the Bible into English under John Wycliffe&#x27;s proto-Reformation and, ironically for a Cornish-speaker, is the third most cited source for the very first appearance of many words in the English language. He also added many notes to his translation c. 1387 of the Polychronicon relating to the geography and culture of Cornwall.

Norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new Cornish-Norman ruling class including scholars such as Richard Rufus of Cornwall. These families eventually became the new rulers of Cornwall, typically speaking Norman French, Breton-Cornish, Latin, and eventually English, with many becoming involved in the operation of the Stannary Parliament system, the Earldom and eventually the Duchy of Cornwall. The Cornish language continued to be spoken.

==Tudor and Stuart period==
===1485–1603===


The general tendency of administrative centralisation under the Tudor dynasty began to undermine Cornwall&#x27;s distinctive status. For example, under the Tudors, the practice of distinguishing between some laws, such as those related to the tin industry, that applied simply &quot;in Anglia&quot; or &quot;in Anglia et Cornubia&quot; (in England and Cornwall) ceased.

The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 originated among Cornish tin miners who opposed the raising of taxes by Henry VII to make war on Scotland. This levy was resented for the economic hardship it would cause; it also intruded on a special Cornish tax exemption. The rebels marched on London, gaining supporters as they went, but were defeated at the Battle of Deptford Bridge.

The Cornish also rose up in the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. Much of south-western Britain rebelled against the Act of Uniformity 1549, which introduced the obligatory use of the Protestant Book of Common Prayer. Cornwall was mostly Catholic in sympathy at this time; the Act was doubly resented in Cornwall because the Prayer Book was in English only and most Cornish people at this time spoke the Cornish language rather than English. They therefore wished church services to continue to be conducted in Latin; although they did not understand this language either, it had the benefit of long-established tradition and lacked the political and cultural connotations of the use of English. Twenty percent of the Cornish population are believed to have been killed during 1549: it is one of the major factors that contributed to the decline in the Cornish language.

===English Civil War (1642–1649)===

Cornwall played a significant role during the English Civil War, as it was a Royalist semi-enclave in the generally Parliamentarian south-west. The reason for this was that Cornwall&#x27;s rights and privileges were tied up with the royal Duchy and Stannaries and so the Cornish saw the King as protector of their rights and Ducal privileges. The strong local Cornish identity also meant the Cornish would resist any meddling in their affairs by any outsiders. The English Parliament wanted to reduce royal power. Parliamentary forces invaded Cornwall three times and burned the Duchy archives. In 1645 Cornish Royalist leader Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet made Launceston his base and he stationed Cornish troops along the River Tamar and issued them with instructions to keep &quot;all foreign troops out of Cornwall&quot;. Grenville tried to use &quot;Cornish particularist sentiment&quot; to muster support for the Royalist cause and put a plan to the Prince which would, if implemented, have created a semi-independent Cornwall.

==18th and 19th centuries==
===1755 Tsunami===
On 1 November 1755 at 09:40 the Lisbon earthquake caused a tsunami to strike the Cornish coast at around 14:00. The epicentre was approximately off Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast, over south west of the Lizard. At St Michael&#x27;s Mount, the sea rose suddenly and then retired, ten minutes later it rose very rapidly, then ebbed equally rapidly, and continued to rise and fall for five hours. The sea rose in Penzance and at Newlyn. The same effect was reported at St Ives and Hayle. The 18th-century French writer, Arnold Boscowitz, claimed that &quot;great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall&quot;.

===Developments in tin mining===

At one time the Cornish were the world&#x27;s foremost experts of mining (See Mining in Cornwall and Devon ) and a School of Mines was established in 1888. As Cornwall&#x27;s reserves of tin began to be exhausted, many Cornishmen emigrated to places such as the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa where their skills were in demand.

There is only one mine, South Crofty in Cornwall, that is currently being restarted. Also, a popular legend says that wherever you may go in the world, if you see a hole in the ground, you&#x27;ll find a Cornishman at the bottom of it. Several Cornish mining words are in use in English language mining terminology, such as costean, gunnies, and vug.

Since the decline of tin mining, agriculture and fishing, the area&#x27;s economy has become increasingly dependent on tourism—some of Britain&#x27;s most spectacular coastal scenery can be found here. However, Cornwall is one of the poorest parts of Western Europe and it has been granted Objective 1 status by the EU.

In 2019, Canadian mining company, Strongbow Exploration announced it was looking to resume tin mining at South Crofty.

===Politics, religion and administration===
Cornwall and Devon were the site of a Jacobite rebellion in 1715 led by James Paynter of St. Columb. This coincided with the larger and better-known &quot;Fifteen Rebellion&quot; which took place in Scotland and the north of England. However, the Cornish uprising was quickly quashed by the authorities. James Paynter was tried for High Treason but claiming his right as a Cornish tinner was tried in front of a jury of other Cornish tinners and was cleared.

Industrialised communities have long appeared to weaken the pre-eminence of the Church of England, and as the Cornish people were readily involved in mining, a rift developed between the Cornish people and their Anglican clergy in the early 18th century. Resisting the established church, many ordinary Cornish people were Roman Catholic or non-religious until the late 18th century, when Methodism was introduced to Cornwall during a series of visits by John and Charles Wesley. Methodist separation from the Church of England was made formal in 1795.

In 1841 there were ten hundreds of Cornwall: Stratton, Lesnewth and Trigg; East and West Wivelshire; Powder; Pydar; Kerrier; Penwith; and Scilly. The shire suffix has been attached to several of these, notably: the first three formed Triggshire; East and West appear to be divisions of Wivelshire; Powdershire and Pydarshire. The old names of Kerrier and Penwith have been re-used for modern local government districts. The ecclesiastical division within Cornwall into rural deaneries used versions of the same names though the areas did not correspond exactly: Trigg Major, Trigg Minor, East Wivelshire, West Wivelshire, Powder, Pydar, Kerrier and Penwith were all deaneries of the Diocese of Exeter but boundaries were altered in 1875 when five more deaneries were created (from December 1876 all in the Diocese of Truro).

=== Smuggling heyday ===
The peak of smuggling in Cornwall was evident in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Import taxes and other duties on goods led to a number of traders and consumers evading the extra price burden by using the county&#x27;s ragged coastline as a landing point for dutiable goods. The most trafficked items were brandy, lace and tobacco, imported from Continental Europe. The Jamaica Inn pub on Bodmin Moor has been noted for its early association with smuggling. By the 19th century, a large proportion of the population of Cornwall – an estimated 10,000 people, including women and children – were thought to take part in the smuggling business. The rate of smuggling subsided in the coming century, and by the 1830s, two factors were established to have combined to make smuggling less worthwhile – improvements in coastguard services which led to capture, and the reduction of excise duties on imported goods.

==20th and 21st centuries==
A revival of interest in Cornish studies began in the early 20th century with the work of Henry Jenner and the building of links with the other five Celtic nations.

A political party, Mebyon Kernow, was formed in 1951 to attempt to serve the interests of Cornwall and to support greater self-government for the county. The party has had elected a number of members to county, district, town and parish councils but has had no national success, although the more widespread use of the Flag of St Piran has been accredited to this party.

There have been some developments in the recognition of Cornish identity or ethnicity. In 2001 for the first time in the UK the inhabitants of Cornwall could record their ethnicity as Cornish on the national census, and in 2004 the schools census in Cornwall carried a Cornish option as a subdivision of white British. On 24 April 2014 it was announced that Cornish people will be granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.

<doc id="1139389" wikidata="Q684485" url="?curid=1139389" title="Treaty of Zgorzelec">
<text>The Treaty of Zgorzelec (Full title &quot;The Agreement Concerning the Demarcation of the Established and the Existing Polish-German State Frontier&quot;, also known as the &quot;Treaty of Görlitz&quot; and &quot;Treaty of Zgorzelic&quot;) between the Republic of Poland and East Germany (GDR) was signed on 6 July 1950 in Zgorzelec, Poland. 

==Signing== 
The agreement was signed by Otto Grotewohl, prime minister of the provisional government of the GDR (East Germany) and Polish premier Józef Cyrankiewicz. It recognized the Oder-Neisse line implemented by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement as the border between the two states. The terms referred to the &quot;defined and existing border&quot; from the Baltic Sea west of Świnoujście - however without mentioning Szczecin - along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers to the Czechoslovak border. Thereby the East German government also accepted the division of Kostrzyn nad Odrą/Küstrin-Kietz, Słubice/Frankfurt (Oder), Gubin/Guben and Zgorzelec/Görlitz. This border drawing gave Poland a quarter of the pre-war territory of Germany according to the borders of 1937, whose German-speaking population either fled in the final stages of the war or 
had been expelled in the wake of the German defeat in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

==International reaction and impact==
The treaty was worded as a declaration and was, initially, not recognised as a legitimate international treaty by West Germany insisting on its exclusive mandate and the members states of NATO. Four years later when the Soviet Union granted East Germany independence, the Soviet Union reserved rights over East Germany (similar to the rights reserved by the Western Allies over West Germany under the Bonn–Paris conventions) pending a final peace treaty with Germany - the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. So although the treaty was binding on Poland and East Germany, for several decades it was not seen by many western members of the international community as such. The West German government continued to maintain that the status of the territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were &quot;under Polish and Soviet administration&quot; until in 1970 Chancellor Willy Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, giving &quot;de facto&quot; acknowledgement of the border and confirming West Germany&#x27;s acceptance of the Treaty of Zgorzelec as an international agreement binding on the states that were party to it. The validity of the Treaty of Zgorzelec was explicitly confirmed in a judgement of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1973 on the Basic Treaty between East and West Germany. Reunited Germany formally accepted the Oder-Neisse boundary in the German–Polish Border Treaty (1990).

==Location of signing==
The community centre in which the treaty was signed is one of Zgorzelec&#x27;s main sights and is found in a park beside the road bridge border crossing. Built in typical Wilhelmine style, it was originally opened as the Upper Lusatian Memorial Hall (), and has been known as the Municipal House of Culture in Zgorzelec () since 1975.

<text>Piero Umiliani (17 July 1926 – 14 February 2001) was an Italian composer of film scores.

==Biography==

Umiliani was born in Florence, Tuscany. Like many of his Italian colleagues at that time, he composed the scores for many exploitation films in the 1960s and 1970s, in genres such as Spaghetti Westerns, Eurospy, Giallo, and softcore sex films.

His composition &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; (1968) was originally used in &quot;&quot;, a 1968 Mondo documentary about Sweden. It was a minor charting single (spending 6 weeks on the Billboard chart and peaking at #55, and reaching #22 in Canada), popularized by &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, first airing in October 1969, and The Muppets, who covered the song several times; starting on episode 0014 of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on 27 November 1969, then &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; three days later, and again on the syndicated series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1977. The track was also a hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1977.

Umiliani&#x27;s other scores included &quot;Son of Django&quot;, &quot;Orgasmo&quot;, &quot;Gangster&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Death Knocks Twice&quot;, &quot;Five Dolls for an August Moon&quot;, &quot;Baba Yaga&quot;, &quot;The Slave&quot; and &quot;Sex Pot&quot;. His orchestra score &quot;Arrivano I Marines&quot; for &quot;War Italian Style&quot;, a 1966 comedy about two USMC soldiers in Italy, is used in the Armored Trooper Votoms series as &quot;March of the Red Shoulders&quot;.

His composition &quot;Crepuscolo Sul Mare&quot; was used in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;. More recently, his composition &quot;Echi Della Natura&quot; featured on the soundtrack of Ashim Ahluwalia’s 2012 film &quot;Miss Lovely&quot;.

Outside of his film score work, Umiliani formed the rock band Braen&#x27;s Machine with Alessandro Alessandroni.

Umiliani died in Rome in February 2001, at the age of 74.

<doc id="1139405" wikidata="Q16149456" url="?curid=1139405" title="History of Derbyshire">
<text>The history of Derbyshire can be traced back to human settlement since the last Ice Age, over 10,000 years ago. The county of Derbyshire in England dates back to the 11th century.

==The origins of Derbyshire==

Derbyshire is first mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 1048 in Manuscript D, known as the &quot;Northern Recension&quot;. Its creation appears to be a result of the dismemberment of the Mercian Kingdom&#x27;s province of the Peak District and the chronicle says, under 1048: “her wæs eac eorðstyrung on Kalendas Maias on manegum stowum, on Wygracestre on Wic on Deorby elles gehwær, eac wæs swiðe mycel mancwealm orfcwealm, eac þæt wilde fyr on Deorbyscire micel yfel dyde gehwær elles.” (&quot;This year also there was an earthquake, on the calends of May, in many places; at Worcester, at Wick, and at Derby, and elsewhere wide throughout England; with very great loss by disease of men and of cattle over all England; and the wild fire in Derbyshire and elsewhere did much harm&quot;).

Some old sources wrongly refer to a charter from 926 for land at Hope and Ashford as being “in Derbyshire” but the original of the charter does not say Derbyshire, it just says Hope and Ashford. On the other hand, the later and final appearance of the Mercian Kingdom&#x27;s province of the Peak District occurs in a charter of King Edgar in 963, where land at Ballidon near Wirksworth is being granted. This charter refers to the land as being “in pago Pecset” not &quot;on Deorbyscire&quot;.

Administrative change of the Mercian provinces is often attributed to King Edgar and if this were so then his charters would reflect it, but the Ballidon charter of 963 does not. Therefore, it is more likely that the shiring of Derbyshire and the dismemberment of the Pecsaete took place after 975 in the reign of Æthelred the Unready with the remainder of the Peak District being hived off to Nottinghamshire (two hundreds); Cheshire (one hundred) and Staffordshire (one, possibly two, hundreds), the remaining seven forming Derbyshire.

The name &quot;Derbyshire&quot; is derived from the Old English word &quot;shire,&quot; meaning a division of a kingdom with its own governor, with the town of Derby being its administrative centre.

== Natural history ==
The White Peak area of the county is named after the limestone landscape of the Derbyshire Dome anticline. The carboniferous limestone was formed about 300 million years ago and the plateau is generally between 200m and 300m above sea level. This limestone outcrop is surrounded on the west, north and east by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger sandstones (gritstones) and shales, known as the Dark Peak.

== Prehistory ==

Paleolithic remains of human settlement have been discovered at Creswell Crags (between Chesterfield and Worksop), in Dowel Cave and Fox Cave near Buxton and in Ash Tree Cave and Langwith Cave near Bolsover. The finds in the caves at Creswell Crags gorge include ancient rock art, stone axes and bones from hyena and woolly rhinoceros.

Arbor Low Neolithic henge is the largest stone circle in Derbyshire and there are numerous other Neolithic and Bronze Age henges in the county including Doll Tor, Nine Ladies, Nine Stones Close and The Bull Ring. The remains of a Stone Age settlement (a Mesolithic timber roundhouse and of two Neolithic longhouses) was discovered in 1984 at Lismore Fields in Buxton.

There were Iron Age hillforts at Castle Naze (overlooking Chapel-en-le-Frith), Fin Cop (near Ashford-in-the-Water) and Mam Tor (overlooking Castleton).

These sites are nearly all protected Scheduled Monuments.

== Roman ==

Before the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, Derbyshire was within the territory of the Coretani tribe. It then became part of the Roman province of Flavia Cæsariensis.

The Romans established military forts, roads and lead mining in Derbyshire, during their occupation of the province of &quot;Britannia&quot; during the 1st to 5th centuries. Forts were situated at &quot;Derventio&quot; (Little Chester near Derby), Chesterfield, &quot;Melandra&quot; (Glossop) and &quot;Navio&quot; (Brough-on-Noe). Each fort had a civilian settlement (&quot;vicus&quot;) around it. &quot;Aquae Arnemetiae&quot; (waters of the goddess of the grove) was a Roman bath town, founded around the natural warm springs of Buxton. &quot;Lutudarum&quot; was the Roman lead-mining centre in the area of Wirksworth and Carsington.

Ryknield Street connected Derby (and on to Gloucestershire) with Chesterfield (and on to Yorkshire). Batham Gate (&quot;road to the bath town&quot;) ran from Templebrough fort (near Rotherham) to Navio fort and on to Buxton. Doctor&#x27;s Gate linked Chesterfield with Glossop via Navio, The Street Roman Road ran from Glossop through Buxton and on toward Derby.

== Saxon ==
In Anglo-Saxon times, Derbyshire was in the kingdom of Mercia, and the Saxon kings had a residence by the River Trent at Repton (where King Wiglaf of Mercia and King Æthelbald of Mercia are both buried). During the reigns of King Æthelred the Unready and King Alfred the Great, there were numerous battles between the Saxons and the Danes in Derbyshire. The Vikings occupied the town of Derby for many years.

The Viking cemetery at Heath Wood near Repton (south of Derby) contains a series of 59 barrows (burial mounds), which is the only known Scandinavian cremation site in the British Isles.

== Norman ==

Following the Norman Conquest of England, the Domesday Book of 1086 AD lists the tenants-in-chief of lands in &quot;Derbyscire&quot;:

* King William the Conqueror
* Bishop of Chester
* Abbey of Burton
* Earl Hugh of Chester
* Roger de Poitou
* Henry de Ferrers
* William Peverel, who built Peveril Castle at Castleton.
* Walter D&#x27;Aincourt
* Geoffrey Alselin
* Ralph son of Hubert (FitzHubert)
* Ralph de Buron
* Hascoit Musard de Bretagne
* Gilbert de Gant (Ghent)
* Nigel de Stafford
* Robert Curthose
* Roger de Busli
* King&#x27;s Thanes

==Medieval hundreds==

Derbyshire was traditionally divided into Hundreds, namely Appletree, High Peak, Morleyston and Litchurch, Repton and Gresley, Scarsdale, Wirksworth. These were based on the six earlier Wapentakes recorded in the Domesday Book, with a split of Walecross Wapentake into Repton and Gresley and a split of Hamenstan Wapentake into High Peak and Wirksworth taking place, among other gradual changes in the Hundred or Wapentake names. Derbyshire had a detached part in north-western Leicestershire, surrounding Measham and Donisthorpe. This escaped regularisation in 1844, and was incorporated into Leicestershire in 1888 when the county councils were set up. The thin strip of Leicestershire between the exclave and Derbyshire, containing Overseal and Netherseal, is now considered part of Derbyshire. Apart from this, some parishes in historic Derbyshire, including Dore, Norton and Totley, are now in the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, having formerly been in the Scarsdale Wapentake. 

From the time of the Norman Conquest the Royal Forest of Peak was established as a royal hunting reserve and it covered most of the north west of Derbyshire. It was administered by William Peverel and in 1305 it extended over about 100 square miles.

== Elizabethan ==
During the reign of Elizabeth I, several Elizabethan great houses were built including Chatsworth House (rebuilt in the late 17th century), Hardwick Hall, Padley Hall and Barlborough Hall.

Mary Queen of Scots was held in custody (on royal command) by George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury at Chatsworth House several times between 1569 and 1584. She was permitted to visit the spa town of Buxton to ‘take the cure’ for her rheumatism most years from 1573 to 1584, under guard and for up to a month at a time.

== Stuart ==
Derbyshire was aligned to the Parliamentarians (&quot;Roundheads&quot;) during the English Civil War of 1642–1646. Sir John Gell of Hopton Hall raised a regiment in Derbyshire and fortified Derby against threats from the Royalists (&quot;Cavaliers&quot;). In 1644 the Royalists were defeated at the battle of Egginton Heath. The Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish of Chatsworth House, was a Royalist and went into exile, only returning with The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. He repaired Bolsover Castle, which had been ruined to in order prevent it becoming a Royalist stronghold.

During the Great Plague of 1665–1666, the village of Eyam famously isolated itself to prevent spreading the bubonic plague to the surrounding towns and villages.

== Industrial Revolution ==
In the early 18th century, Richard Arkwright established cotton-spinning mills, using pioneering machinery, by the River Derwent at Cromford and Matlock Bath. The Cromford Mill, Masson Mills, Derby Silk Mill and Jedediah Strutt’s mills at Belper developed the industrial textile factory system. Derwent Valley Mills is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Cromford and High Peak Railway was completed in 1831, to carry industrial goods between the Cromford Canal and the Peak Forest Canal at Whaley Bridge.

Limestone quarrying and lime burning has taken place around Buxton for centuries. Demand for lime (also known as quicklime) grew dramatically during the Industrial Revolution. The arrival of the Cromford and High Peak Railway through Buxton generated further expansion of quarrying. During the 19th century lime from Buxton was supplied to make soda ash in Northwich for the Lancashire cotton industry and for glass manufacture in St Helens.

Lead has been mined in Derbyshire since Roman times. In the late 16th century watered-powered smelting mills, with furnaces fired by wood or charcoal, were introduced to smelt lead ore on an industrial scale. Magpie Mine near Bakewell, Lathkill Dale mines and the Beans and Bacon mine near Bonsall adopted innovative machinery to increase production throughout the 17th to 19th centuries.

Derby developed as an engineering centre in the 19th century and became a major railway manufacturing centre as the base for the North Midland Railway.

== Georgian and Victorian ==
Buxton and Matlock Bath were developed as spa towns during the 18th century. The Dukes of Devonshire commissioned the building of the Crescent and Buxton Baths for Buxton to rival the spa towns of Bath and Harrogate. In 1698 warm springs were discovered at Matlock Bath and by Victorian times it had become a fashionable spa destination. The advent of the railways in the 19th century brought much greater numbers of visitors from London and Manchester into the Peak District towns.

== 20th century ==

Derbyshire County Council was established in 1889 and was reconstituted in 1972. The county is divided into 8 boroughs:

* Amber Valley Borough Council
* Erewash Borough Council
* Bolsover District Council
* Chesterfield Borough Council
* North East Derbyshire District Council
* High Peak Borough Council
* Derbyshire Dales District Council
* South Derbyshire District Council

Derby City Council became a separate unitary authority in 1997 but it remains part of the ceremonial county of Derbyshire.

<text>Khia Shamone Finch ( ; &#x27;Chambers&quot;&#x27;; born November 8, 1976) is an American rapper and record producer. 
She is known for her only-charting single, &quot;My Neck, My Back (Lick It).&quot;

== Early life ==
Khia was born Khia Shamone Finch Chambers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised in its Germantown neighborhood. She moved to Tampa, Florida, when she was 11. Khia attended Dowdell Middle School and Hillsborough High School. She left school sophomore year after she got pregnant. In 1991, Khia had her first child, a daughter also named Khia. In 1992, she moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, when the father was stationed there and had her second child, a son named Rashawn, while she was living with him. Before becoming a rapper, she worked as a bartender at Club XS in Tampa. Her mother Carol Belinda Chambers, who was a data entry specialist, died in 2001.

== Music career ==
=== 2000–2002: &quot;Thug Misses&quot; ===

Khia released her debut album, &quot;Thug Misses&quot;, in 2002 on Dirty Down/Artemis Records as a re-release from the original version by Divine Records. The lead single &quot;My Neck, My Back (Lick It)&quot; became a breakthrough single, charting at #42 on the Hot 100 chart and #12 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. MTV News reported that she wrote &quot;My Neck, My Back&quot; in 15 minutes.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Gangstress&quot; ===

In 2004, Khia appeared on a track with Trick Daddy and Tampa Tony called &quot;J.O.D.D. (Jump On Da Dick)&quot; from Trick&#x27;s album &quot;Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets&quot;.
Khia&#x27;s second album was supposed to be released in 2003 by the title &quot;Street Preacher&quot;. The album was complete by mid-2003, and was set for released by the end of 2003, but the album got shelved for unknown reasons. In 2006 Khia recorded another album to be her second album, Gangstress.

Khia&#x27;s second album, &quot;Gangstress&quot;, was released on July 11, 2006, on Phase One Communications. It debuted at #67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Later in 2006, Khia also collaborated with Janet Jackson on her hit &quot;So Excited&quot;, which peaked at #90 on the Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.

=== 2007–2008: &quot;Nasti Muzik, Boss Lady Mixtape&quot; ===

After signing to Big Cat Records, and still with her own label Thug Misses Entertainment, Khia finished working on her third studio album, &quot;Nasti Muzik&quot;, released on July 22, 2008. &quot;What They Do&quot; was the first promotional single on the album, which featured Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane. The first single, &quot;Be Your Lady&quot;, was produced by Tampa&#x27;s Push-a-Key Productions. Khia promoted the upcoming album by releasing a mixtape entitled &quot;The Boss Lady&quot;, which was hosted by DJ Scream.

Khia participated in the VH1 reality show &quot;Miss Rap Supreme&quot; in 2008. Khia was eliminated from the competition for rapping a song recorded prior to the show, &quot;Respect Me&quot;.

=== 2009–2012: &quot;Motor Mouf/Khia Shamone&quot; ===

Khia began working on her fourth album, &quot;MotorMouf aka Khia Shamone&quot;, in 2009. On May 4, 2010, she released the lead single from the album, &quot;Been a Bad Girl&quot;. A video for the single was shot in New York by Clifton Bell. The song showed a different, more sensitive side of the rapper. Following its release, Khia stopped by a local ABC News show to promote the single. In 2010, she told the website &quot;HipHopDX&quot; that the album will feature her singing instead of rapping on some of its cuts. A second single, a smooth R&amp;B song, &quot;So Addicted&quot;, followed &quot;Been a Bad Girl&quot;. That track was compiled on the &quot;Khia Shamone&quot; section of the album. She&#x27;s since released the singles, &quot;Pay Your Pussy Bill&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot; from the album.

==Legacy==
&quot;Khia&quot; was also coined as a term for a &quot;nobody&quot; by fans of Nicki Minaj on Twitter. It originated in 2014 from a post of a photo of an overwhelmed fan meeting Khia captioned &quot;This gotta be photoshopped. Ain&#x27;t nobody crying when they meet Khia in 2014.&quot; Its usage exploded in 2023 on Stan Twitter. The phrase &quot;khia asylum&quot; also evolved into a term for when pop artists are stuck in relative obscurity until their commercial breakthrough.

<doc id="1139415" wikidata="Q7761625" url="?curid=1139415" title="The Rouse Company">
<text>The Rouse Company was a publicly held shopping mall and community developer from 1956 until 2004, when General Growth Properties (GGP) purchased the company. It was founded by Hunter Moss and James W. Rouse in 1939.

==Beginnings: Moss-Rouse Company==

The Moss-Rouse Company was founded as a FHA mortgage company with a loan from Hunter Moss&#x27;s sister. Rouse leveraged his knowledge as loan guarantee specialist at the Federal Housing Administration to establish a Baltimore-based mortgage company specializing in FHA backed loans. Moss-Rouse hired a World War Two Navy friend, Churchill G. Carey from Connecticut General, who in turn provided capital for future projects. Carey would hold positions ranging from president to CEO of the mortgage company subsidiary. In 1952-1953 the company built one of the first modern architecture office buildings on Saratoga Street in Baltimore, while also dropping its commercial lending business line. Jim Rouse hired his brother, Willard Rouse II, in 1952, and partner, Hunter Moss, phased out of operations, selling his shares of the company, while remaining temporarily on the board of directors. The firm was renamed the &quot;James W. Rouse &amp; Company, Inc.&quot;, with Rouse owning 50% equity, his brother, Willard, 10%, and 40%, to company officers.

==The James W. Rouse Company==
The James W. Rouse Company built some of the first enclosed shopping malls, and it pioneered the development of festival marketplaces, such as Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Faneuil Hall in Boston, South Street Seaport in New York City, Harborplace in Baltimore, and Bayside Marketplace in Miami. They also developed The Shops at National Place in downtown Washington, D.C. that opened in 1984–85.

On 20 June 1966, The James W. Rouse Company was renamed &quot;The Rouse Company&quot;. The company has been credited as the pioneer of the first successful food court in an enclosed shopping mall, when the food court at the Sherway Mall in Toronto opened in 1971. It followed an unsuccessful attempt at the Plymouth Meeting Mall in 1968, which reportedly failed because it was &quot;deemed too small and insufficiently varied.&quot;

The company moved its headquarters to the Cross Keys development, then to the project in Columbia, Maryland in December 1969.

Its community projects include the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore and the planned communities of Columbia, Maryland (where it was headquartered), Bridgeland Community, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada. To develop these projects, in 1962 Rouse brought on Bill Finley, who built a planned &quot;company town&quot;, Ravenswood, West Virginia, was a former planner with the National Capital Planning Commission proposing planned cities, and was a proponent of public-private partnerships.

Columbia Research and Development was founded as a public company and Howard Research and Development was formed as a Rouse subsidiary in 1956 to raise capital for four mall projects and later to facilitate the Columbia Project with Connecticut General and Chase Manhattan as stakeholder with interest deferred loans. In 1966 The James W Rouse Company was restructured as the Rouse Company, adding Howard Research and Development (HRD) as a separate entity shielded Rouse Corporation from debt liability of the Columbia development. HRD lost money, with new rules affecting the parent company as well. In 1974, HRD was refinanced. Columbia Development Corporation was formed a subsidiary of HRD using subcontracted Rouse Company employees. In 1985 CIGNA (Connecticut General) divested its interest in HRD and the project back to Rouse for $120 million at a net loss.

Rouse created the subsidiary company The American City Corporation to take advantage of the National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970, A HUD program which granted developers incentives and loans to build Title VII &quot;New Towns&quot; with mandatory percentages of low income housing projects. Rouse&#x27;s former ACTION member, Leo Molinaro was selected to run the subdivision. The symposiums held by the company gathered together investors like George Mitchell, who would go on to develop Woodlands, Texas using the Columbia model. The subsidiary was based at &quot;Two Wincopin&quot; in the second office building in built in Columbia in 1968. It was renamed the American City Building, using the subsidiary to lease the empty space and develop the system of Public-Private partnerships that Rouse would use worldwide to minimize risk in developments using public debt. The business was given its own postal office, the American Cities Station in 1977.

The Columbia development was marketed as a progressive community for all races. In 1971, the company responded to pressure from the NAACP that the company was absent of African Americans at all management levels and its businesses in Columbia were predominantly white owned. The company responded with an affirmative action program in November 1971.

In 1973, the former assistant attorney general of Maryland, Mathias J. DeVito, left the Rouse-owned legal firm of DLA Piper to replace James W. Rouse as President of the Rouse Company, and Rouse became Chairman. DeVito cut staff from 1,700 to 500 to keep the company afloat in 1975. In 1974, the Columbia development got a political boost as the population of Columbia supported a slate of at-large council candidates with Columbia interests, including Ruth U. Keeton, Lloyd Knowles, and Columbia&#x27;s city manager, Richard L. Anderson.

In 1979, Simon H. Schuer acquired a 7.5% interest in the Rouse Company. He was the creator of &quot;The Shrink&quot;, a method where an investor buys an interest in a company, then orders stock buy-backs to make the interest more valuable. Schuer died the day after the purchase, and Trizec Properties then acquired the shares and bought a 25% stake. In 1986, the company attempted to purchase a majority share.

In 1985, The Rouse Company absorbed all of Connecticut General&#x27;s interests in the Howard Research and Development subsidiary. In 1986, former general manager of Columbia and executive vice president of development Micheal Spear became president as a successor to Rouse. In 1990, Spear died in a crash with his wife and one daughter in his Piper PA-31T Cheyenne attempting a single engine missed approach near Logan International Airport.

In 1997, Anthony Deering took over as CEO of the company.

On November 12, 2004, the Rouse Company was sold to General Growth Properties.

In 2012, General Growth Properties spun off 30 &quot;class B&quot; malls into Rouse Properties, a new real estate investment trust named after (but otherwise unrelated to) The Rouse Company.

<doc id="1139419" wikidata="Q387718" url="?curid=1139419" title="Africanization">
<text>Africanization or Africanisation (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service via processes such as indigenization.

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of placenames and personal names to reflect an &quot;African&quot; identity. In some cases, changes are not only of transliteration but of the European name.

In many cases during the colonial period, African placenames were Anglicized or Francized.

===Place names===
====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and secessions, territories gaining sovereignty, and regime changes.

====Other place names====

*Fernando Po island changed to Bioko Island
*Léopoldville changed to Kinshasa
*Salisbury changed to Harare
*Lourenço Marques changed to Maputo
*Nova Lisboa changed to Huambo
*Fort Lamy changed to N&#x27;Djaména
*Tananarive changed to Antananarivo
*Bathurst changed to Banjul
*Santa Isabel/Port Clarence changed to Malabo
*Élisabethville changed to Lubumbashi
*Stanleyville changed to Kisangani
*Luluabourg changed to Kananga
*Ponthierville changed to Ubundu
*Novo Redondo changed to Sumbe
*Moçâmedes changed to Namibe, but changed back to Moçâmedes in 2016
*Abercorn changed to Mbala
*Broken Hill changed to Kabwe
*Fort Jameson changed to Chipata
*Hartley changed to Chegutu
*Fort Victoria changed to Masvingo
*Many places whose names were of European origin in South Africa have undergone Africanization since 1994; see South African Geographical Names Council.
*Port Elizabeth changed to Gqeberha in 2021.

===Personal names===
*Joseph-Désiré Mobutu changed to Mobutu Sese Seko
*François Tombalbaye changed to N&#x27;Garta Tombalbaye
*Étienne Eyadéma changed to Gnassingbé Eyadéma
*Francisco Macías Nguema changed to Masie Nguema Biyogo Ñegue Ndong
Sometimes, the name change can be used to reflect a change of faith, most prominently seen in the case of Islam. (See Islamic name.)

Examples:
*Albert-Bernard Bongo changed to Omar Bongo
*Dawda Jawara changed to David Jawara in 1953
*Jean-Bédel Bokassa changed to Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries after following their independence, &quot;Africanization&quot; was the name given to racial policies and affirmative action, which were intended to increase the number of indigenous Africans in the civil service.

==Localization in African languages==

The term Africanization, abbreviated as the numeronym &quot;A12n,&quot; has been applied to discussion of internationalization and localization of software and content in African languages.

<text>Blaj (; archaically spelled as &quot;Blaș&quot;; ; ; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Blußendref&quot;) is a city in Alba County, Transylvania, Romania. It has a population of 17,816 inhabitants (2021).

The city administers eight villages: Deleni-Obârșie (&quot;Obursatanya&quot;), Flitești, Izvoarele (until 1960 &quot;Ciufud&quot;; &quot;Csufud&quot;), Mănărade (&quot;Monora&quot;), Petrisat (&quot;Magyarpéterfalva&quot;), Spătac (&quot;Szászpatak&quot;), Tiur (&quot;Tűr&quot;), and Veza (&quot;Véza&quot;).

The city was the principal religious and cultural center of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in Transylvania.

==History==
Blaj is first mentioned in 1271 as &quot;Villa Herbordi&quot;, after the deed of a Count Herbod. In 1313, the domain passed to Herbod&#x27;s son Blasius Cserei and the town was mentioned as &quot;Blasii&quot;. Started as a hamlet for the twenty families of servants of the noble&#x27;s court, it was awarded town status on May 19, 1737.

Blaj is the principal religious and cultural center of Greek Catholics in Transylvania. At 27 October 1687 begins the history of the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic, history directly connected to the history of the town Blaj. It all started at the end of the treaty through which Transylvania was entering under the protection of Austria, renouncing the protection of the Turkish Empire.

The first public school in Romanian was established in Blaj in 1754. Blaj was the first place to have Romanian written with Latin alphabet instead of Cyrillic in which it had traditionally been written. Blaj was also a center for the Romanian Age of Enlightenment, being the founding site of the Transylvanian School that promoted the Roman cultural heritage of the Romanians. Thus Blaj gained the nickname &quot;The Little Rome&quot;, as Romania&#x27;s national poet Mihai Eminescu called it.

In 1848, Câmpia Libertății in Blaj was where over 40,000 Romanians met to protest Transylvania becoming a part of Hungary, holding that the lands would be stolen from them.

<text>Devon is a county in south west England, bordering Cornwall to the west with Dorset and Somerset to the east. There is evidence of occupation of the county from the Stone Age onwards. Its recorded history starts in the Roman period, when it was a civitas. It was then a separate kingdom for a number of centuries until it was incorporated into early England. It has remained a largely agriculture-based region ever since, though tourism is now very important.

==Prehistory==
Devon was one of the first areas of Great Britain settled following the end of the last ice age. Kents Cavern in Torbay is one of the earliest places in England known to have been occupied by modern man. Dartmoor is thought to have been settled by Mesolithic hunter-gatherer peoples from about 6000 BC, and they later cleared much of the oak forest, which regenerated as moor. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming on the moor, and also building and the erection of monuments, using the large granite boulders that are ready to hand there; Dartmoor contains the remains of the oldest known buildings in England. There are over 500 known Neolithic sites on the moor, in the form of burial mounds, stone rows, stone circles and ancient settlements such as the one at Grimspound. Stone rows are a particularly striking feature, ranging in length from a few metres to over 3 km. Their ends are often marked by a cairn, a stone circle, or a standing stone (see menhir). Because most of Dartmoor was not ploughed during the historic period, the archaeological record is relatively easy to trace.

The name &quot;Devon&quot; derives from the tribe of Celtic people who inhabited the south-western peninsula of Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in 43 AD, the Dumnonii: possibly meaning &quot;deep valley dwellers&quot; (Cornish: &quot;Dewnens&quot;, Welsh: &quot;Dyfnaint&quot;, Breton: &quot;Devnent&quot;) or &quot;worshippers of the god Dumnonos&quot;. This tribal name carried on into the Roman and post-Roman periods. The Dumnonii did not mint coins, unlike their neighbours to the east, the Durotriges, but coins of the Dobunni have been found in the area. 

There was a Bronze Age trading port at Mount Batten in Plymouth Sound.

=== Archaeology ===
In February 2022, archaeologists led by Rob Bourn, managing director of Orion Heritage, announced the discovery of the remains of a woolly mammoth, reindeer, rhinoceros, bison, wolf and hyena in a cave system during the building of a new town named Sherford. Over 200 clusters of bones were removed by the explorers to analyse the life in Ice Age in Britain. Remains of a tusk, molar tooth, other bones of a woolly mammoth, a partial skull and a mandible of a woolly rhinoceros date to the middle of the last ice age between 60,000 and 30,000 years ago.

==Roman period==
Devon was not as heavily Romanized as Somerset and Dorset, with the majority of the occupation&#x27;s traces being in the Exeter area, where the Roman fortifications can still be seen. It is likely a settlement at Exeter of some sort pre-existed the Romans and that the local Brythonic tribe inhabiting the area, the Dumnonii, maintained a tradition of independence. It appears that initially the Dumnonii tribe of Britons were a client kingdom of Rome, but from about AD 55 the Romans held at least part of the area under military occupation, maintaining a naval port at Topsham and a garrison of the 2nd Augustan Legion at Exeter, which they called &#x27;Isca&#x27;. This banked and palisaded fortress contained mostly barracks and workshops, but also a magnificent bath-house and was occupied for approximately twenty years. Then the legion moved to Caerleon and the civilians of the surrounding settlement took control. All the associated trappings of local government followed, such as a forum and basilica and, eventually a stone city wall. The Roman administration stayed here for over three centuries. There were several smaller forts across the county and a number of pagan shrines, as remembered in the name of the &quot;Nymet&quot; villages (Nemeton), but the lands west of the Exe remained largely un-Romanized. The higher status locals there often lived in banked homesteads known as &#x27;Rounds&#x27;, while East Devon had a number of luxurious villas, such as that discovered at Holcombe, as well as Roman roads of the sophisticated cobbled type.

==Post Roman Independence==

After the end of Roman rule in Britain in about 410, the kingdom of Dumnonia emerged, covering Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, based on the former Roman civitas and named after the pre-Roman Dumnonii. Gildas criticised King Constantine, who was probably a second generation ruler of Dumnonia in the early sixth century. The Roman episcopal structure survived, and shortly before 705 Aldhelm, abbot of Malmesbury, wrote a letter to King Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops.

Exeter, known as &quot;Caer Uisc&quot;, may have been central to the kingdom, but some historians and antiquaries have speculated that the Kings of Dumnonia may have been itinerant with no fixed capital and moved their court from place to place. The Welsh Triads name Celliwig in Cornwall as a possible site of a royal court; another is High Peak, close to Sidmouth. The former Roman city of Exeter may have become an ecclesiastical centre, as evidenced by a sub-Roman cemetery discovered near the cathedral. The Brythonic cemetery in Exeter may have been attached to the monastery attended by the young Wilfred St. Boniface (said to be a native of Crediton) in the late 7th century. However its abbot had a purely Saxon name, suggesting it was an Anglo-Saxon foundation.

== Anglo-Saxon conquest of Dumnonia ==

The date that the Anglo-Saxons began to settle in Devon is not certain. Raids westwards from the core territories of Wessex into what is now Somerset seem to have been set in motion about 660. After the Battle of Peonnum, fought probably at Penselwood in 658, the West Saxons advanced to the River Parrett. By 682 they had reached the Quantocks and were pressing forward into the coastal plain. Wessex under King Cynewulf emerged from Mercian domination and began advancing west again from Taunton, established as an advanced West Saxon position in 710 by King Ine, who defeated in that year the last recorded independent king in Devon; the codified Laws of Ine made provision for the &quot;Wealhas&quot;, the Welsh &quot;foreigners&quot;, some of whom retained positions of responsibility. The end of the fighting appears to have been a protracted and miserable affair. Campaigns by King Ecgberht of Wessex in Devon between 813 and 822 appear to have resulted in the defeat of the West Welsh in Cornwall but not their complete disposition. William of Malmesbury reports negotiations between King Alfred of Wessex and King Dungarth of the Cornish in c. 876 held somewhere near Exmoor in Devon; presumably Alfred would have sought reassurances over his western frontier as he conspired to defeat the Danes.
It seems most likely that the final acts of conquest of Devon by Wessex came under King Æthelstan of the English. William of Malmesbury claimed that &quot;the Britons and Saxons inhabited Exeter &quot;aequo jure&quot;&quot; - &quot;as equals&quot;. However Æthelstan notably expelled “that filthy race” from Exeter in 927. although some historians believe this to be inaccurate, simply reflecting the racism of the author. Some sources, notably the Cornish antiquary William Borlase, state that the expulsion of the Britons from Exeter was the first act in a military campaign against the West Welsh led by Æthelstan. William Borlase says there was a battle against King Howel of the West Welsh at Haldon near Teignmouth in 936 where the West Welsh were soundly defeated. It seems they were then pursued westwards across the River Tamar and through Cornwall where they were defeated again close to Land&#x27;s End in what may have been a “last-ditch” encounter that probably ended in slaughter, thus rendering the statement made centuries earlier and known to us as &quot;The Groan of the Britons&quot; seem morbidly appropriate; &quot;The barbarians drive us to the sea, the sea drives us to the barbarians, between these two means of death we are either killed or drowned&quot;. An inflamed and astonished Welsh reaction to these events is found in the contemporary poem, &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, where the last independent king of Cornwall, reputedly King Howel, was said to lament:

&quot;Sorrow springs from a world upturned.&quot;

==Devon in Anglo-Saxon times==

By the 9th century, the major threat to peace in Devon came from Viking raiders. Thus Alfred the Great refortified Exeter as a defensive burh, followed by new fortifications at Lydford, Halwell and Pilton, although these were relatively small compared to burhs further east; suggesting these were protection for only the elite. Edward the Elder built similarly at Barnstaple and Totnes. The English defeated a combined Cornish and Danish force at Callington in 832. Sporadic Viking incursions continued, however, until the Norman Conquest, including the disastrous defeat of the Devonians at the Battle of Pinhoe in 1001. A few Norse placenames remain as a result, for example Lundy Island. The men of Devon are said by Asser to have fought the Danes at the Battle of Cynwit in 878, which may have been at Kenwith Castle or Countisbury, although Cannington in Somerset is also claimed as the site of the battle. In 894, the Danes attempted to besiege Exeter but were driven off by Alfred; however it was sacked in 1001.

Devon was originally part of the bishopric of Winchester, but in around 705 the see was divided and a separate bishopric of Sherborne was established, covering Devon, Dorset and Somerset, with Aldhelm as its first bishop. In about 910 the bishopric was again divided, with each county getting its own bishopric. Eadwulf became the first Bishop of Crediton. In 1050 King Edward the Confessor combined Devon and Cornwall and Leofric was appointed Bishop of Exeter.

==Norman and medieval period==
Immediately after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror recognised the importance of securing the loyalty of the West Country and thus the need to secure Exeter. The city withstood an eighteen-day siege and the new king was only eventually allowed to enter upon honourable terms.

The many great estates subsequently held by William&#x27;s barons in Devon were known as &quot;honours&quot;. Chief amongst them were Plympton, Okehampton, Barnstaple, Totnes and Harberton. In the 12th century, the honour of Plympton, along with the Earldom of Devon, was given to the Redvers family. In the following century, it passed to the Courtenays, who had already acquired Okehampton, and in 1335 they received the earldom too. It was also in the 14th century that the Dukedom of Exeter was bestowed on the Holland family, but the dukedom became extinct in the reign of Edward IV. The ancestors of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was born at East Budleigh, held considerable estates in the county from a similar period. Devon was given an independent sheriff. Originally an hereditary appointment, this was later held for a year only. In 1320, the locals complained that all the hundreds of Devon were under the control of the great lords who did not appoint sufficient bailiffs for their proper government.

During the civil war of King Stephen&#x27;s reign, the castles of Plympton and Exeter were held against the king by Baldwin de Redvers in 1140. Conflict resurfaced in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the French made frequent raids on the Devon coast; and during the Wars of the Roses, when there were frequent skirmishes between the Lancastrian Earl of Devon and the Yorkist Lord Bonville. In 1470, Edward IV pursued Warwick and Clarence as far as Exeter after the Battle of Lose-coat Field. Warwick eventually escaped to France via Dartmouth. Later, Richard III travelled to Exeter to personally punish those who had inflamed the West against him. Several hundred were outlawed, including the Bishop and the Dean.

Dartmoor and Exmoor (mainly in Somerset) were Royal Forests, i.e. hunting preserves. The men of Devon paid 5000 marks (£3,333) to have these deforested in 1242. The 11th to 14th centuries were a period of economic and population growth, but the Black Death in 1348 and subsequent years caused decline in both, with resulting social change; many villages and hamlets such as 12th century Hound Tor were said to have been deserted, whilst new settlements were later granted to the rising class of tenant farmers exemplified by the surviving 14th century Dartmoor longhouse settlement at Higher Uppacott, and peasant farmers subsequently prospered with large flocks of sheep and cattle. Towns such as Totnes were particularly noted for their wealth derived from the wool and tin trade with the Continent in this period.

==Tudor and Stuart period==

Early in Henry VII&#x27;s reign, the royal pretender, Perkin Warbeck, besieged Exeter in 1497. The King himself came down to judge the prisoners and to thank the citizens for their loyal resistance.

Great disturbances throughout the county followed the introduction of Edward VI&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer. The day after Whit Sunday 1549, a priest at Sampford Courtenay was persuaded to read the old mass. This insubordination spread swiftly into serious revolt. The Cornish quickly joined the men of Devon in the Prayer Book Rebellion and Exeter suffered a distressing siege until relieved by Lord Russell.

Devon is particularly known for its Elizabethan mariners, such as Sir Francis Drake, Mayor of Plymouth, Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville and Sir Walter Raleigh. Plymouth Hoe is famous as the location where Drake continued to play bowls after hearing that the Spanish Armada had been sighted. Plymouth was also the final departure point for the Mayflower in 1620, although the settlers themselves were mainly drawn from Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.

During the Civil War, the cities of Devon largely favoured the Parliamentarian cause, and by and large the rural areas favoured the Royalists. but there was a great desire for peace in the region and, in 1643 a treaty for the cessation of hostilities in Devon and Cornwall was agreed. Only small-scale skirmishes continued until the capture of Dartmouth and Exeter in 1646 by Sir Thomas Fairfax. He then captured Tiverton and defeated Lord Hopeton&#x27;s army at Torrington. The last place held for the king was Charles Fort at Salcombe.

After the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, Judge Jefferies held one of his ‘bloody assizes’ at Exeter. In 1688, the Prince of Orange first landed in England at Brixham (where his statue stands in the town harbour) to launch the Glorious Revolution and his journey to London to claim the English throne as William III. He was entertained for several days at both Forde and at Exeter.

==Modern period==

In the modern period, since 1650, the city of Plymouth has grown considerably, becoming the largest city in Devon, mainly due to the naval base at Devonport to its west. Plymouth played an important role as a naval port in both World War I and World War II. South Devon was a training and assembly area during World War II for the D-Day landings, and there is a memorial to the many soldiers who were killed during a rehearsal off Slapton Sands. Both Plymouth and Exeter suffered badly from bombing during the war, and the centre of Exeter and vast swathes of Plymouth had to be largely rebuilt during the 1960s.

Cold winters were a feature of the 17th century, that of 1676 being particularly hard. There were smallpox epidemics in the 1640s, 1710s and 1760s, resulting in many deaths. In October 1690 there was an earthquake in Barnstaple. Daniel Defoe published an account of a tour through Devon in 1724 and 1727. South Devon impressed him, but he thought that north Devon was wild, barren and poor.

During the Napoleonic War a prison was built at Princetown on Dartmoor to hold French and American prisoners of war. This prison is still in use.

In 1842 the population was said to be mainly employed in agriculture. The population rose in the 19th century, but the rate of increase was only around half that of the population of England and Wales as a whole.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Devon has experienced great changes, including the rise of the tourist industry on the so-called English Riviera, decline of farming and fishing, urbanisation, and also proliferation of holiday homes, for example in Salcombe. Devon has become famous for its clotted cream and cider. Dartmoor has become a National Park, as has Exmoor.

Devon has suffered many severe storms, including one that largely swept away Hallsands in 1917.

Politically Devon has had a tendency to lean towards the Conservative and Liberal/Liberal-Democrat parties.

==Mining history==
Devon has produced tin, copper and other metals from ancient times. Until about 1300 it produced more than Cornwall, but production declined with the opening of the deep Cornish mines. Tin was found largely on Dartmoor&#x27;s granite heights, and copper in the areas around it. It was exported from Mount Batten in prehistoric times. The Dartmoor tin-mining industry thrived for hundreds of years, continuing from pre-Roman times right through to the first half of the 20th century. In the 18th century Devon Great Consols mine (near Tavistock) was believed to be the largest copper mine in the world.

Devon&#x27;s tin miners enjoyed a substantial degree of independence through Devon&#x27;s stannary parliament, which dates back to the 12th century. Stannary authority exceeded English law, and because this authority applied to part-time miners (e.g. tin streamers) as well as full-time miners the stannary parliament had significant power. Until the early 18th century the stannary parliament met in an open air parliament at Crockern Tor on Dartmoor with stannators appointed to it from each of the four stannary towns. The parliament maintained its own gaol at Lydford and had a brutal and &#x27;bloody&#x27; reputation (indeed Lydford law became a byword for &quot;in&quot;justice), and once even gaoled an English MP in the reign of Henry VIII.

Tin and tungsten have most recently been mined at Hemerdon Ball (near Plymouth). During World War 2 the mine was operated to ensure a domestic supply of both metals. The mine has periodically re-opened since then and is currently known as Hemerdon Mine

<text>Mikhail Vasilyevich Isakovsky (; – 20 July 1973) was a Soviet and Russian poet, lyricist and translator. Hero of Socialist Labour (1970).

==Biography==

Mikhail Isakovsky was born in Glotovka, Yelninsky Uyezd, Smolensk Governorate, to a poor peasant family of ethnic Russians. A local priest taught him to read and write. Later he studied at a gymnasium for two years. His first poem, &quot;Просьба солдата&quot;, was published in 1914 in Russian newspaper &quot;Nov (Новь)&quot;. In 1918, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1921 until 1931, he worked in Smolensk newspapers. In 1927, his first book of poems, &quot;Провода в соломе&quot;, was published. In 1931, he left for Moscow.

Many poems of Isakovsky are set to music. The most famous are &quot;Katyusha (&quot;Катюша&quot;)&quot; (music by Matvey Blanter), &quot;The Enemy Burned My Native Hut (&quot;Враги сожгли родную хату&quot;)&quot; (music by Matvey Blanter), &quot;In the Frontier Forest (&quot;В лесу прифронтовом&quot;)&quot;, and &quot;Migrant Birds Fly (&quot;Летят перелётные птицы&quot;)&quot;, and &quot;Lonely Accordion (&quot;Одинокая гармонь&quot;)&quot;. His songs &quot;What You Were Is What You Are (&quot;Каким ты был, таким ты и остался&quot;)&quot; and &quot;Oh, Arrowwood Is Blooming (&quot;Ой, цветет калина&quot;)&quot;, set to music by Isaak Dunayevsky, were used in the film &quot;Cossacks of the Kuban (Кубанские казаки)&quot; (1949).

The song &quot;The Enemy Burned My Native Hut (&quot;Враги сожгли родную хату&quot;)&quot; (1945) was officially criticized for &quot;pessimism&quot; and was not printed or sung until 1956.

As a result of cooperation with Vladimir Zakharov, Isakovsky&#x27;s poems set to music appear in the repertoire of the Pyatnitsky Choir. The most widely known of them are &quot;Along the Village (&quot;Вдоль деревни&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Seeing Off (&quot;Провожанье&quot;)&quot; and &quot;You Can Never Tell (&quot;И кто его знает&quot;)&quot;. According to Alexandra Permyakova, chief musician of the Pyatnitsky Choir, these songs made the Choir famous.

He twice received the Stalin Prize for his songwriting (1943, 1949). In 1970, he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. He was also awarded four Orders of Lenin, in addition to other orders and medals.

He also published a book on the subject of poetry, &quot;О поэтическом мастерстве&quot; (&#x27;On Poetic Mastery&#x27;).

Mikhail Isakovsky died in Moscow on 20 July 1973, and he was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.

<text>Big Bad is a term to describe a major recurring adversary, usually the chief villain or antagonist in a television series or a particular broadcast season of a series, originally used by the series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It has since been used to describe annual villains in other television series, and has also been used in scholarly work discussing &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

In gaming, this term is often abbreviated BBEG, which stands for &quot;Big Bad Evil Guy/Gal,&quot; a tradition that began on message boards for the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

== On &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; ==
The term &quot;Big Bad&quot; was originally used on American television program &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (which aired 1997–2003). According to author Kevin Durand (2009), &quot;While Buffy confronts various forms of evil during each episode, each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer had its own &#x27;big bad&#x27; villain who dominates throughout the season. The power of the &#x27;big bad&#x27; always threatens to end the world, but Buffy ultimately overcomes him or her in the season finale.&quot; The series balanced its episodic stories with advancing that season&#x27;s big bad story arc.

The term was originally used in the episode &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, in which Buffy Summers describes the newly soulless Angel as &quot;the big, bad thing in the dark&quot;. The prior episode, &quot;Phases&quot;, has Xander Harris &quot;being&quot; the werewolf and saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the big, bad wolf.&quot; The phrase may originate in various fairy tales (particularly &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; and the related song) about the &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot;. The phrase &quot;big bad&quot; by itself as a noun was first used on screen in Season 3, in the episode &quot;Gingerbread&quot; where Buffy says that an occult symbol is harmless, &quot;not a big bad&quot;. Slang generation was encouraged in the writers&#x27; room. Marti Noxon, writer and eventually showrunner, said that &quot;Big Bad&quot; was used &quot;long before the characters themselves started using the phrase&quot;. Using &quot;big bad&quot; as a noun instead of using as an adjective is a functional shift, which was done often on the show.

The first &quot;Big Bad&quot; villain on the program was The Master, played by Mark Metcalf. According to author Jan Jagodzinski, the battle between Buffy and the evil Master is &quot;the central issue of season one&quot;; The Master, like all the &quot;big bads&quot;, is a &quot;symptom of postmodernity&quot;.

David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that Joss Whedon, creator of the series, made the model for the Golden Age of television: 

== On other television and film series ==

The use of Big Bads has become common in TV science fiction and fantasy series, especially with more binge-watching of serialized shows.

In the Arrowverse, after 8 years and 20 collective seasons, the series &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; had 22 Big Bads, which TVLine ranked based on &quot;Compelling Backstory, Fearsome Appearance, Powers/Skills, Utter Ruthlessness, Eeeevilness of Agenda, Despicable Damage Done&quot;. But Den of Geek&#x27;s Dave Golder questioned the continued use of the &quot;season-long baddie&quot; plot device.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; revival has occasionally used Big Bads. Jef Rouner of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote how &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series 6 succeed with the &quot;proper format,&quot; beginning with a new villain to the series, the Silence. He also wrote that for series 11, &quot;The main villain is regular old human cruelty and apathy to suffering&quot;, adding this had some similarity to &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; season 6&#x27;s Big Bad, “life.” But Lacy Baugher wrote on Syfy Wire that the show can have the smaller personal, emotional stories, and doesn&#x27;t need the &quot;big, sweeping arcs and grand monsters&quot;. &quot;Each Big Bad the Doctor faced had to be the most dangerous in the universe.&quot;

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Big Bad for &quot;The Infinity Saga&quot; was Thanos. In &quot;The Multiverse Saga&quot;, the current one, the new bad guy is Kang the Conqueror.

<text>Young Judaea is a peer-led Zionist youth movement that runs programs throughout the United States for Jewish youth in grades 2–12. In Hebrew, Young Judaea is called &quot;Yehuda Hatzair&quot; (יהודה הצעיר) or is sometimes referred to as &quot;Hashachar&quot; (השחר), lit. &quot;the dawn&quot;. Founded in 1909, it is the oldest Zionist youth movement in the United States.

==History and organization==
Founded in 1909, Young Judaea is a peer-led youth movement. Its programs include youth clubs, conventions, camps and Israel programs with an emphasis on social action and Jewish identity. Young Judaea has 15 regions in the United States and is affiliated with the Federation of Zionist Youth (United Kingdom) and Tzofim (Israel). The age levels are &quot;Ofarim&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;fawns;&quot; grades 2–5), &quot;Tsofim&quot; (&quot;scouts,&quot; grades 6–7), and &quot;Bogrim&quot; (&quot;elders,&quot; grades 8–12). Young Judaea&#x27;s university arm was formerly called HaMagshimim, meaning &quot;the fulfillers&quot;), now college programs focus primarily on volunteering and interning in Israel as well as Birthright trips.

In 1967, Hadassah became the sponsor of Young Judaea. During this period, Young Judaea grew to become the largest Zionist youth movement in America. It took on Tikkun Olam as a fundamental pillar, becoming involved in the national civil rights and Soviet Jewry movements and helping local communities across the country.

In 1997, Young Judaea forged partnerships with its two sister movements - the Hebrew Scouts Movement in Israel (Tzofim) and the Federation of Zionist Youth (FZY) in the United Kingdom. This was done to strengthen the connection between Jewish, Zionist youth in Israel and the diaspora. These partnerships have allowed for a greater exchange of ideas and experiences, fostering a stronger sense of global Jewish identity and commitment to the Zionist cause.

After almost 70 years of association with Hadassah, Young Judaea moved toward organizational independence in 2012. Despite the change, the movement continued to grow, learn, and build new experiences for the next generations of Judaeans.

==Principles==
All Young Judaea programs are centered around the movement&#x27;s ideology. The charter of the organization, officially titled &quot;Yehudah Hatzair Leumi Chukah,&quot; outlines the ideology and goals of the organization. Its main points include:
* Young Judaea is a politically non-partisan and religiously pluralistic organization.
* Young Judaea is a Zionist youth movement, recognizes the State of Israel as a central part of Jewish life and encourages visiting Israel.
* As a Jewish youth movement, Young Judaea stresses Jewish values, Jewish education, and the preservation of the identity of the Jewish people.
* Social action is a part of both the Jewish and Zionist identities and as such Young Judaea works to help Jews and others in need both local and worldwide.
* A cohesive community can be built regardless of religious and political affiliations.

==Leadership==
Young Judaea is a peer-run organization with &quot;mazkiriyot&quot; (boards) of peer leaders on local, regional, and national levels.

The National Mazkirut is elected at Young Judaea&#x27;s National Midwinter Convention by a convention body consisting of &quot;Bogrim&quot; (9th-12th grade members of the movement). The National Mazkirut serves for a one-year period.

The regional Mazkirut activity levels varie throughout the country. Most regions with an active mazkirut contain at least some of the positions listed below.

===Young Judaea leadership positions===
* Mazkir or Mazkira (literally: &quot;secretary&quot;) This position is president of the Mazkirut.
* Merakez/et Irgun (literally: organizational coordinator) This position is the Administrative Vice President (AVP) of the Mazkirut. Responsibilities include finances, membership, and logistics for the national level and overseeing the regional AVPs, along with acting as general Vice President to the Mazkir. The Midwest Region of Young Judaea divides the position of AVP into an AVP of Logistics and an AVP of Finance.
* Merakzei Chinuch (literally: educational coordinators) These positions create educational programming for each of the different age groups. Prior to the mid-1990s there was one national coordinator for all of the age groups.These positions exist on both a national and regional levels with the national level coordinators assisting the regional ones.
** &quot;Bogrim.&quot; This position creates curriculum and activities for the Bogrim (8th–12th grade) age group. Responsibilities include programming for the Bogrim National Midwinter Convention and National Summer Convention.
** &quot;Ofarim/Tsofim.&quot; This position creates curriculum and activities for the Ofarim and Tsofim (2nd–7th grade) age group. Responsibilities include programming, encouraging members to attend Ofarim/Tsofim regional summer camps and encouraging continuing participation in Young Judea after finishing the Ofarim/Tsofim age level.
* Merakez/et Tikkun Olam v&#x27;Yisroel Social Action and Israel Programmer (SAIP). This position develops social action events and ensures that tikkun olam values are built into all programs at the national level and regional levels. Their educational focus is defined by tikkun groups—different social action groups formed that are focused on five different issues (threats to Israel, pikuach nefesh, environmentalism, human rights, and poverty). They also manage volunteer opportunities for participants. Along with that, the National SAIP is in charge of updating Young Judaeans on Israeli current events. 
* Pirsumim (literally: &quot;advertising&quot;) This position is responsible for publishing newsletters, informational documents and advertisements for the movement. This includes the national online newsletter (Kol Ha&#x27;Tnua; literally &quot;voice of the movement), event promotion, web pages, and press releases.
* Merakez/et Havurah Metahnenet (Russian Programming Coordinator) This position plays the role of coordinating events and programming in relations to Machaneh Tel Yehudah’s Havurah Program. Machaneh Tel Yehudah’s Havurah program is a part of Young Judaea to inspire Russian-speaking Jews to strengthen their identity, culture, and heritage in a unique community. S/he must engage the Russian-Jewish community to influence their self-identity.
* National Zarit (international Liaison) Enhances communication and programming between YJers internationally 

As of 2022-2023, the National Mazkirut is still very active in running this peer-led youth movement. 
*The positions are held by:

**Noa Ganz - Merakez Tikkun Olam v&#x27;Yisroel (Social Action and Israel Programmer)
**Samara Kohn - Pirsumim (Publicity)
**Uri Levinson - National Zarit

==Merchavim and regions (Past and Present)==
Young Judaea was traditionally divided into five units, called &quot;Merchavim&quot; (the singular: &quot;Merchav&quot;), which were titled according to their geographical location in the United States (including Puerto Rico). The Merchavim were subdivided into geographical regions. In the past each region was composed of clubs on the local level although this practice has all but ceased. Until the mid-1970s, the regions were referred to using English language names. more recently the regions were referred to using Hebrew language names.

The two Merchavim with active mazkiriyot are:

The Midwest Merchav is composed of &quot;Pneinu Artza&quot; (the Great Plains – North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana), &quot;Ayelet Hashachar&quot; (the central states – Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky), and &quot;Ruach B&#x27;Tzion&quot; (western Pennsylvania, abbreviated WPA)

The Northeast Merchav contains &quot;Ya&#x27;ar Penn&quot; (eastern Pennsylvania, abbreviated &quot;EPA&quot;), &quot;Empiria&quot; (English: Empire – New York state, excluding Long Island and New York City, and Fairfield County, Connecticut), &quot;Ganei Yehudah&quot; (New Jersey), &quot;Eeyey Tsiyon&quot; (Long Island/New York City abbreviated &quot;LINYC&quot; or &quot;LI/NYC&quot;), and &quot;Uri Tsafon&quot; (New England – Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, excluding Fairfield County)
The three Merchavim without active mazkiriyot are:The Southeast Merchav (known colloquially as &quot;Boom Boom&quot;) contains &quot;G&#x27;lil Yam&quot; (North Carolina, minus Hendersonville and Asheville, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia), &quot;Or Hadarom&quot; (Florida minus the Panhandle and Puerto Rico), and &quot;Lev Hadarom&quot; (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee. South Carolina, Arkansas, eastern Louisiana, the Florida Panhandle, and western North Carolina)

The Southwest Merchav is a single region, &quot;Ookaf Hadarom&quot; (Texas, Oklahoma and western Louisiana)

The West Merchav contains &quot;Chagurat Hashemesh&quot; (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana), &quot;Ruach Hama&#x27;arav&quot; (Nevada and California), and &quot;Yoreh&quot; (Washington state, Oregon and Idaho)
The Northeast Merchav currently has three mazkiriyot in Empire, LINYC, and New Jersey. The three mazkiriyot act mostly independently although they plan a convention together, traditionally held at the end of the school year. The northeast is considered to be the most active area for regular Young Judaea programming.
The Midwest Merchav currently operates with one merchav wide Mazkirut. This Mazkirut traditionally plans a convention held in early march each year. Midwest also still maintains the only traditional &quot;club&quot; left in Young Judaea in Pittsburgh. This club has regular meeting and events and is run by a Va&#x27;ad (small group of teens with a certain task) and assisted by a parent volunteer. The Chicago area has sporadic programming run by a combination of local members and the merchav wide Mazkirut.
No other merchavim or regions have currently active mazkiriyot.

==Programs==

===Conventions===
Conventions are central to the Young Judaea experience. They fall into two categories: Merchav/Regional, and National. Merchav/Regional Conventions are organized by the local Regional/Merchav Mazkirut, there are two a year and are held in late fall/early winter and spring. During these conventions, regional Mazkirut are elected. Typical convention programming features educational workshops called &quot;sadnaot,&quot; educational activities called &quot;peulot,&quot; prayers, and plenty of &quot;chofesh&quot; (free time) for socializing. The National Midwinter convention takes place every year during Presidents&#x27; Day weekend. National Summer Convention is held in mid-August at Camp Tel Yehudah. Both of these conventions are open to any member of the movement in 9th through 12th grade. At the Midwinter Convention the movement elects a new National Mazkirut and makes amendments to the &quot;Chukah&quot; (the movement&#x27;s constitution). At the Summer Convention, the newly elected members of the National Mazkirut are sworn in and changes are made to the Chukah.

===Summer camps===
Like many other youth movements, YJ operates summer camps for its members. The age restrictions and age groups and differ by each YJ camp and their different policies/ programming. For example, Camp Judaea in North Carolina starts at Rishonim (Campers going into grades 1, 2, and 3) and goes through Offarim (Campers going into grade 4), Oranim (Campers going into grade 5), Sayarim (Campers going into grade 6), Tsofim (Campers going into grade 7), Kesher (Campers going into grade 8), Bogrim (Campers going into grade 9), and Tikkun Olam/ Chalutzim (Campers going into grade 10.)
* Camp Young Judaea Midwest in Waupaca, Wisconsin
* Camp Young Judaea Texas in Wimberley, Texas
* Camp Young Judaea Sprout Lake in Verbank, New York
-Camp Young Judaea Sprout Brooklyn Brooklyn, New York

-Camp Young Judaea Sprout Westchester Croton-On-Hudson, New York
* Camp Judaea in Hendersonville, North Carolina

Tel Yehudah allows teens going in to the 9th grade, 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade to attend. Although some YJ camps age group programs overlap with the ages at Tel Yehudah. For example, Camp Judaea still has Bogrim and Tikkun Olam/ Chalutzim while TY starts its first 2 years, many campers either choose to waive the first and/or second year of TY to finish their camps programming, or they can choose to go during another session, (bloc at TY).

Camp Tel Yehudah, the national teen leadership Camp in Barryville, New York. Programs there include &quot;Alumim&quot; (Jewish/Israeli history and development of a Jewish Identity for entering 9th graders), &quot;Yachad&quot; (community building for entering 10th graders), &quot;Hadracha&quot; (leadership and activism for entering 11th graders), and Alternative Summer Break (an immersive community service program open to rising 10th–12th graders). Tel Yehudah has two sessions that are each three and a half weeks long.

The Alumim age group includes two days of hiking, one day of rafting on the Delaware River, and a one-day trip to a big city (often either Philadelphia or New York City). The Yachad age group includes the choice of a four-day kayaking, hiking, biking, photography or volunteering trip in Manhattan. The Hadracha age group goes to Washington, D.C. for four days on &quot;Day on the Hill&quot; to meet with national leaders and representatives and discuss specific modern-day issues, as well as national advocacy organizations.

===Israel programs===
As a Zionist movement, Israel trips are a crucial part of the Young Judaea experience. Youth entering 11th–12th grade can spend several weeks in Israel through Gesher Israel. 

Recent high school graduates can also apply to spend 9 months on the Young Judaea Year Course in Israel program. Young Judaeans participating in Young Judaea Year Course are often able to transfer credits received on Year Course to their college. The basic Year Course program is broken up into sections with participants spending four months living in Jerusalem, four months living in Tel Aviv with the option to spend two of those months participating in Marva, training and serving as a junior medic, volunteering, interning, living on a kibbutz, and finally one month exploring special interests around the country. Young Judaea Year Course differentiates itself from most other movement freshman year abroad programs by immersing participants in Israeli life. Participants are encouraged to become part of Israeli society for their year in Israel. There are also many specialty tracks catering to participants&#x27; hobbies or interests, including fitness and business. 

Young Judaea alumni founded Kibbutz Ketura together with members of the Hebrew Scouts in 1973.

===Social activism===
Young Judaea has been active in social action projects including involvement in bringing constituencies to Darfur rallies and raising funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Young Judaea has raised nearly $30,000 for various causes, including Hadassah Hospital, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and Latet, all in Israel. In the fall of 2005, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, Young Judaea embarked on a program called Caravan 4 Katrina. The &quot;Caravan&quot; consisted of four truckloads (two from the Northeastern U.S. and two from the Southeastern U.S.) of food, toys, and clothes were collected and delivered to Katrina victims in Jackson, Mississippi in time for Thanksgiving.

Another activism program Young Judaea leads is an annual Alternative Winter Break. Starting in 2007, participants traveled to different regions of the United States to perform community service and learn about the culture of the region. Previous trips have included New Orleans LA; Navajo Nation AZ; New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Southern Florida; and Puerto Rico.

==Songs==
Singing is a large part of Young Judaea camps around America. The official song of Young Judaea is &quot;Ani v&#x27;Ata&quot; by Arik Einstein. Many songs sung in Young Judaea can be found in the Young Judaea &quot;shiron&quot; (song book).

==Alumni==
A number of Young Judaea alumni groups have been established. There is an online Young Judaea alumni blog, the Chorsha.

Four alumni from the camp in Sprout Lake -- MLB.com reporter Jonathan Mayo, Daniel Miller, Jeremy Newberger, and Seth Kramer, of Ironbound Films -- were the producers of &quot;Heading Home: The Tale of Team Israel&quot;, a 2018 award-winning documentary film about the Israel national baseball team competing for the first time in the World Baseball Classic.

<doc id="1139466" wikidata="Q3472467" url="?curid=1139466" title="Short Hills, New Jersey">
<text>Short Hills is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) situated within Millburn, in Essex County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey, and part of the New York metropolitan area. The community is a commuter town for residents who work in Manhattan. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 14,422.

In the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s rankings of the &quot;Most Expensive ZIP Codes in the United States&quot;, Short Hills was listed among the top 100 nationwide, coming in 66th in 2006 (with a median sale price of $1,200,000) and 67th in 2012 (median of $1,951,846). The median household income in Short Hills, according to the United States Census Bureau, exceeded $250,000 in the period from 2018-2022, while per capita income, as of the 2020 United States Census, was $153,124.

Short Hills is home to the upscale Mall at Short Hills, also known as the Short Hills Mall, located near affluent communities in neighboring Morris and Union counties along the Passaic River.

== History ==
===18th century===
The area that became Short Hills was initially part of Springfield Township, and its eponymous hills are thought to have played a role in the movement of the Continental Army under George Washington during the Battle of Springfield (June 23, 1780). While troops may have been present in the area, the Battle of Short Hills (June 26, 1777) took place in Scotch Plains and Metuchen.

Short Hills began as a planned community when Stewart Hartshorn, who became wealthy from developing, perfecting, and manufacturing the self-acting shade roller, purchased of land in the township of Millburn, near the present Hobart Avenue, Parsonage Hill Road, and Chatham Road. Hartshorn intended to create &quot;a harmonious community for people who appreciated nature,&quot; and &quot;where natural beauty would not be destroyed by real estate developments, and where people of congenial tastes could dwell together.&quot; He later increased his land holdings to for himself and for the whole village, with each plot not owned by Hartshorn being no larger than 1/2 acre.

Hartshorn chose the name &quot;Short Hills&quot; because it reflected the topography of the region, and also because the local Lenape Native Americans used that same name to describe the region. One local resident suggested that he call his village &quot;Hartshornville,&quot; but he refused, quietly content with Short Hills sharing his initials.

===19th century===

Hartshorn situated his ideal town near enough to a railroad to allow for an easy commute to Hoboken and, from there, to New York City. Hence, his decision in 1879 to build, at his own expense, a railroad station along the original Morris and Essex Railroad line. He also persuaded the United States Post Office to open a branch in his new railroad station in 1880, and in fact, the Post Office has always had a presence in Short Hills from that day, as well as its own ZIP Code, 07078.

Hartshorn deliberately preserved strips of land along the railroad right-of-way from any development west of Old Short Hills Road. These strips separate Hobart Avenue to the north, and Chatham Road to the south, from the railway line. The only structure that has ever stood directly adjacent to the line is the railroad station.

===20th century===
In 1944, the Hartshorn family also donated Crescent Park to the township of Millburn, directly across from the station, with the stipulation that the park always remain open to the public.

After 17 houses were erected, Hartshorn turned his attention to other common elements, including a music hall, which later became the Short Hills Racquets Club.

Stewart Hartshorn died in 1937 at the age of 97. His daughter Cora survived him, wrote her own history of the hamlet, and helped establish the Arboretum that bears her name.

In 1968, Temple B&#x27;nai Jeshurun relocated from Newark to a site in Short Hills. It is the oldest Reform Jewish congregation in New Jersey and, with 1,100 member families, was one of the largest Jewish congregations in the state at the time of the move. Most of the property was purchased from Congressman Robert Kean, father of future New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. The land had originally been given to Kean&#x27;s family by King George III of the United Kingdom.

In 1975, the Millburn-Short Hills Historical Society was formed in conjunction with the American Bicentennial celebrations. The opening of the Kearny Connection in 1996, establishing direct rail service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, enhanced real-estate values immensely.

===21st century===

In 2001, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center opened in Short Hills.

In 2011, the historic Greenwood Gardens opened to the public. Covering , it is one of sixteen garden preservation projects in the United States that is overseen by the Garden Conservancy.

In 2002, local residents planted a memorial tree on the grounds of the railroad station, to honor those of their neighbors who died in the attacks on September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. A public 9/11 memorial at Crescent Park near the Short Hills train station was dedicated in 2021 to mark the 20th anniversary of the attack; Designed by a local artist and made up of 420 steel rings to commemorate the first responders and eight Millburn residents who were killed, the memorial includes two pieces of steel retrieved from the World Trade Center.

The median family income was over $200,000 in the 2010 census, and as of the 2020 census, exceeded $250,000. Dun &amp; Bradstreet has its headquarters in Short Hills.

Short Hills remains a part of the Township of Millburn, and has been a part of it since its inception. Short Hills has its own railroad station and post office branch that are part of a downtown business area that is smaller than downtown Millburn. Located along Chatham Road near the Short Hills station, it includes a pharmacy, small eateries, and specialty shops. The train station waiting room operates as a bar and grill during the evening hours and a newsstand and ticket agent are present from early morning hours until noon.

<text>The Ufton Nervet rail crash occurred on 6 November 2004 when a passenger train collided with a stationary car on a level crossing on the Reading–Taunton line near Ufton Nervet, Berkshire, England. The collision derailed the train, and seven people—including the drivers of the train and the car—were killed. An inquest found that all railway personnel and systems were operating correctly, and the crash was caused by the suicide of the car driver.

In the 10 years after the crash, four further fatal incidents took place on the level crossing and a near-miss occurred when a train traversed the crossing without the barriers lowered. The level crossing was closed and replaced by a road bridge in 2016.

==Background==
===Ufton Nervet level crossing===

Ufton Nervet level crossing was an automatic half-barrier level crossing (AHBC) situated on the Reading–Taunton branch of the Great Western Main Line between and stations in Berkshire. In the United Kingdom, AHBCs are used on roads where traffic is unlikely to block the crossing and where the is not more than . Ufton Nervet AHBC was situated on Ufton Lane, an unclassified road connecting the A4 (between Reading and Newbury) with the village of Ufton Nervet. The railway at the crossing is surrounded by fields, and was a short distance from the A4.

When the barriers are lowered at AHBCs, they extend only across the entrances to the crossing, leaving the exits clear. The crossing sequence—comprising flashing lights, alarms, and the barriers—is triggered automatically by approaching trains when they activate a treadle known as the &quot;strike-in point&quot;. The time given for the train to approach the crossing is dictated by the speed of the line and is sufficient to allow road users to clear the crossing; the minimum time permitted for this is 27 seconds. At Ufton Nervet, the strike-in point was from the crossing, which gave 39 seconds for trains travelling at the line speed of . The crossing was located after a slight right-hand bend, and the maximum visibility of the crossing for drivers on the down line was ; a train travelling at line speed would cover this distance in 13 seconds.

=== Car driver ===
The car driver was Brian Drysdale, a 48-year-old chef employed at Wokefield Park, approximately from Ufton Nervet. He was concerned about the upcoming results from a recent HIV test, thinking that he had contracted the virus from a relationship in the late 1990s and possibly believing that he had developed AIDS. He spoke to NHS Direct in the week preceding his death, saying that he had had suicidal thoughts and thought he was having a nervous breakdown. On 6 November 2004, Drysdale tried four times to telephone the clinic who were testing him for HIV, but it was closed for the weekend. That day he left work at 17:30 GMT and drove to the level crossing.

=== Train and crew ===
The train involved in the crash was the 17:35 First Great Western (FGW) service from to , carrying headcode 1C92. The train consisted of ten vehicles—the leading Class 43 power car (43019; &quot;City of Swansea / Dinas Abertawe&quot;), eight passenger coaches, and a trailing Class 43 power car (43029). It was driven by Stan Martin, who had worked on the railway network for almost 40 years, 30 of which were as a driver. Three further crew members were aboard the train—two train managers and a customer host serving in the buffet car.

==Collision==
On 6 November 2004, the train departed Paddington on time at 17:35, making its first scheduled stop at before departing one minute late at 18:03. After clearing speed restrictions at Southcote Junction, the train accelerated towards the line speed of .

Immediately preceding the collision, an off-duty police officer with Thames Valley Police happened upon Drysdale manoeuvring his Mazda 323 between the barriers on the level crossing. Drysdale appeared to ignore the officer, who was flashing his headlights and sounding his horn. At 18:11, the train reached the strike-in point, triggering the crossing sequence. The police officer attempted to use the emergency telephone at the crossing.

Travelling at , Martin applied the emergency brake 2–3 seconds before the collision. At 18:12, the train collided with the car. The impact trapped the car&#x27;s engine block beneath the train&#x27;s leading axle, lifting the wheelset and causing the bogie to yaw. This in turn made wheel flanges climb and derail. The train continued upright for when it reached a set of points at the start of a loop, causing a &quot;catastrophic derailment&quot; of all vehicles. The leading power car came to rest from the level crossing. The carriages were at varying angles relative to both the vertical and the direction of travel, and the third passenger carriage had been folded horizontally around a bogie after it embedded in an embankment.

Six people were killed at the scene: the car&#x27;s driver, the train driver, and four passengers. A fifth passenger died in hospital the following day. At least two (and as many as four) of the fatalities were passengers who had been ejected through broken windows.

=== Aftermath ===
The police officer who witnessed the incident called 999 and was able to accurately describe the location to emergency services. He could not see the train in the darkness, but using a torch was able to see the wreckage of the car in the downside cess, as well as Drysdale&#x27;s body, which had been ejected from the car and dragged along the tracks from the point of collision. The officer continued along the track where passengers were leaving the wreckage via broken windows and using mobile phones to see in the dark. One of the train managers attempted to use a lineside signal post telephone, but the cables had been damaged in the derailment. At 18:21, he used his mobile phone to contact the Integrated Electronic Control Centre in Swindon. Shortly after, he spoke to the other train manager who informed him that he had deployed track-circuit operating clips.

The first fire appliance arrived at the scene at 18:25, the first ambulance at 18:31, and representatives from Thames Valley Police and the British Transport Police both at 18:35. In total, the scene was attended by 180 police officers, 84 fire crew, 50 ambulance crew, and 36 doctors and paramedics. Crews arrived in 22 fire appliances and 25 ambulances.

Between 200 and 300 passengers were estimated to have been on board. Of these, 120 were injured, 71 admitted to hospital, and 18 described as having serious injuries. Minor injuries were initially treated at the nearby Winning Hand pub.

The railway was blocked until 16 November, with local services being replaced by rail replacement bus services and longer-distance services travelling from Reading to via . After the reopening of the line, a temporary speed restriction was in force to allow of the new track ballast. Leading car 43019 was written off in the collision and was subsequently scrapped. Trailing power car 43029 sustained only minor damage and was later returned to service, eventually being renamed &quot;Caldicot Castle&quot;.

==Investigation and inquest==
An investigation was carried out by Thames Valley Police and British Transport Police, and reports were prepared by the Health and Safety Executive.

The Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) published a preliminary report on 1 February 2005 which stated that there was no evidence that maintenance condition of the train contributed to the derailment, and there was no evidence that Network Rail or First Great Western staff were deficient in their fitness for duty. The investigation found that the automatic half-barrier equipment and its associated ancillary equipment were properly maintained, in good condition, and operated correctly at the time of the incident. The track had been surveyed by a track geometry car 15 days prior to the incident, and all aspects of track geometry were found to be compliant. It was reported that the train driver was following normal operating procedures. The report found that the loss of lighting in all coaches following the crash made passengers&#x27; orientation and egress difficult.

The RSSB report concluded that while converting the crossing to a CCTV-monitored crossing would lower risk of annual fatalities from 1 in 88,000 to 1 in 760,000, the value of the estimated safety benefits was significantly lower than the £1 million cost of the conversion works. The risk of 1 in 88,000 was deemed to be tolerable provided measures were in place to ensure the risk was as low as reasonably practicable. The report made recommendations including improving emergency communications at the level crossing and moving a set of points whose position was a factor in the train&#x27;s derailment. Network Rail implemented all the safety recommendations. The RSSB subsequently undertook research into improving seat and table design on board passenger carriages, as well as the effect of two-point seat belts on minimising passenger injuries during incidents. The report concluded that two-point seat belts would cause more injury to passengers in the majority of incidents, and the RSSB recommended they were not installed. Later studies drew a similar conclusion with three-point seat belts.

RSSB also conducted an R&amp;D programme into requirements for train windows. The report identified that although broken windows resulted in passengers being ejected from carriages at Ufton Nervet, the ability to break windows after an incident is crucial for passengers to escape. A 2007 report stated that the introduction of laminated glass would provide &quot;significantly better passenger containment protection in accidents&quot; than toughened glass. In a consultation with emergency services it was established that laminated glass would still allow rescuers to access trapped passengers.

On 1 June 2005 it was announced that an inquest into the crash would be held at Windsor Guildhall. The inquest, due to open on 17 October 2005, was delayed because of a dispute over whether the families of the victims should be given legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007, after Mr Justice Owen overturned Bridget Prentice&#x27;s original decision to deny legal aid. The jury heard the testimony of the police officer witness, who stated that Drysdale did not appear to be acting with any urgency; he believed that the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. A forensic investigator told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine and lights switched off. Its fuel tank still contained petrol, which the inquest heard suggested that the car had not broken down.

In 2007 the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) described how the absence of an obstacle deflector on the leading power car, as well as the presence of the traction motor and gearbox on its leading axle, increased the likelihood of debris becoming caught beneath the axle. This likelihood was increased by the collision occurring at a level crossing, where the deck surface is level with the rail head.
During the inquest, David Main—whose partner and daughter were killed—described how &quot;trains are not safe [...] If laminated glass had been fitted they wouldn&#x27;t have been [ejected from the carriage]&quot;. The county coroner stated that Drysdale&#x27;s mental health was a &quot;key clue to the cause of the tragedy&quot; and the results of a psychological analysis would play an &quot;active part&quot; in explaining why he parked his car on the crossing. On 1 November 2007 the inquest returned the verdict that the crash was caused by the car driver&#x27;s suicide and that the train driver and five passengers were unlawfully killed. The coroner described the incident as &quot;a unique set of circumstances that had resulted in catastrophic consequences&quot;.

==Subsequent events==
===Royal Humane Society awards===
In 2005 the Royal Humane Society awarded its bronze medal to two passengers who had assisted those injured and trapped after the crash, as well as having found two of the fatalities. The two men found nine-year-old Louella Main and the body of her mother Anjanette Rossi; both had been ejected from the train during the crash. At the 2007 inquest, one of the men testified that on finding Main they &quot;could see blood coming from [her] head&quot;. She had a faint pulse, but died from her injuries. One of the men found a clergyman who had been a passenger on the train, and got him to walk back to the bodies to say a prayer.

===Memorials===

The Ufton Memorial Garden was &quot;dedicated to all those affected&quot; by the collision.
A plaque at the memorial reads &quot;For all those affected by the catastrophic derailment of the First Great Western 17.35 Paddington to Plymouth train on 6 November 2004 [...] One event, many realities&quot;. Originally located on the south side of the railway line, the garden was relocated and joined with one dedicated to Martin in 2015 when preparatory work for the road bridge began.

First Great Western named power car 43139 &quot;Driver Stan Martin 5 June 1950 – 6 November 2004&quot; as a tribute to the train&#x27;s driver. When 43139 was acquired by ScotRail in 2019, the name was transferred to GWR&#x27;s 43198 alongside that of driver Brian Cooper who died in the 1999 Ladbroke Grove rail crash.

===Further incidents===
After the 2004 crash there were fatal incidents at the crossing in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014. The 2010 death was found not suspicious. The coroner&#x27;s inquest into the 2012 death recorded an open verdict as there was insufficient evidence to be certain that that fatality was the result of suicide.
The 2012 collision also caused injury to the InterCity 125 driver. The circumstances surrounding the 2014 fatality were not treated as suspicious.

There was a near miss on 4 September 2011, when a train passed the crossing at without the barriers lowered or the lights illuminated. The driver, having seen a car on the lane, applied the emergency brake and stopped the train beyond the crossing. The RAIB investigated the cause, and found that the crossing was being operated locally by a level crossing attendant who had not received instruction from the signaller (at Thames Valley Signalling Centre in Didcot) to close the crossing. The report concluded that the incident was likely a result of work overload on the signaller.

==Level crossing closure and replacement bridge==

Following the 2011 near-miss incident, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said that AHBCs are prohibited in some countries as unsafe, and that &quot;level crossings on high speed train lines should be banned and replaced with bridges [or] underpasses&quot;. In July 2012, Network Rail announced that the crossing was due for renewal and it was considering either a like-for-like replacement, converting the crossing to full barriers, or installing a bridge. On the tenth anniversary of the 2004 incident, and shortly after the 2014 fatality, the RMT repeated calls for the crossing to be made safe &quot;[with] no more delays&quot;.

In April 2015, Network Rail submitted plans for a road bridge to the east of the crossing. West Berkshire Council approved these in August 2015 and preparatory work began the following month. Construction began in April 2016, and the bridge was officially opened on 16 December 2016. The site of the old crossing was converted for use as a Road Rail Access Point (RRAP) for rail maintenance vehicles to access the railway.

<text>SNL Studios (also known as &quot;Saturday Night Live Studios&quot;) is an American production company founded in 1997 as a joint venture between &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator and producer Lorne Michaels, NBC Studios, and Paramount Pictures. Paramount&#x27;s part of the venture was dissolved in 2004 following NBC&#x27;s merger with Universal Pictures to form NBCUniversal. SNL Studios produces &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in association with Broadway Video (also owned by Michaels), as well as produce movies, mainly featuring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch characters, &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot; and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot;.

Following the announcement of the creation of SNL Studios, veteran &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Marci Klein was named as the president of SNL Studios Television in 1999, while Richard Feldman was appointed head of SNL Studios Films in June of the same year. No on-screen logo was used until 1999.

<text>The Little Sisters is an informal name for a group of some of the smaller islands of the British Virgin Islands, south of Tortola and southwest of Virgin Gorda. These islands are also called the &quot;Southern Islands&quot;.

*Norman Island
*Pelican Island
*Peter Island
*Salt Island
*Cooper Island
*Ginger Island
*Carvel Rock
*Dead Chest Island

Also included in the group are several smaller rocky outcroppings.

The closest thing to a formal endorsement of the term occurs in the Labour Code, 2010 (a British Virgin Islands statute) which includes a reference and statutory definition for the &quot;Sister Islands&quot;, which the Code defines as meaning &#x27;the islands of the Virgin Islands other than Tortola&#x27;.

<text>Matvey Isaakovich Blanter (27 September 1990) was a Soviet composer, and one of the most prominent composers of popular songs and film music in the Soviet Union. Among many other works, he wrote the famous &quot;Katyusha&quot; (1938), performed to this day internationally. He was active as a composer until 1975, producing more than two thousand songs.

==Childhood and education==

Blanter, the son of a Jewish craftsman, was born in the town of Pochep, then in the Chernigov Governorate of the Russian Empire. He studied piano and violin at the Kursk Higher Music School. From 1917 to 1919, he continued his education in Moscow, studying violin and composition.

==Career==
Blanter&#x27;s first songs were composed in the 1920s. At the time, he wrote light dance and jazz music, including &quot;John Gray&quot; (1923), a foxtrot that became a major hit. In the 1930s, as Soviet culture grew more ideologically strict, Blanter shifted toward writing Soviet propaganda songs. He emerged as one of the creators of the Soviet &quot;mass song&quot;.

Some of Blanter&#x27;s 1930s songs were styled after the Red Army songs of the Russian Civil War (1918–1921) and mythologized the war&#x27;s Bolshevik heroes. The most famous among these are &quot;The Song of Shchors&quot; (1935), telling the tale of Ukrainian Red Army commander Nikolai Shchors, and &quot;Partisan Zheleznyak&quot; (1936), which combines the energetic rhythms of a military marching song with elements of a mournful ballad as it describes Commander Zheleznyak&#x27;s heroic death in battle (the song opens and closes with a stanza about Zheleznyak&#x27;s lonely burial mound in the steppes).

Other notable Blanter songs from that period include &quot;Youth&quot; (1937), a cheerful marching song asserting that &quot;right now, everyone is young in our young, beautiful country&quot;; &quot;Stalin Is Our Battle-Glory&quot; (1937), a widely performed hymn to Joseph Stalin; and &quot;The Football March&quot; (1938), music from which is still performed at the start of every football match in Russia.

In 1938, Blanter began his long-lasting collaboration with the poet Mikhail Isakovsky. Their first song, undoubtedly the most famous of Blanter&#x27;s works, was the world-renowned &quot;Katyusha&quot;. In it, Blanter combined elements of the heroic, upbeat battle song and of a peasant song representing a woman&#x27;s lamentation for an absent lover. Standing on a high riverbank, a young woman, Katyusha, sings of her beloved (compared to &quot;a gray eagle of the steppes&quot;), who is far away serving on the Soviet border. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his girl will preserve their love. While the song is joyful and filled with the imagery of a fertile, blooming land, it also conveys the sense that the motherland is under threat. &quot;Katyusha&quot; gained fame during World War II as an inspiration to defend one&#x27;s land from the enemy.

In 1937, Pravda published a request for thousands of Soviet girls to go to work in the far east of the county, to help construct military defences. Blanter was commissioned to write the highly-popular operetta &quot;On the Bank of the Amur River&quot; to celebrate the initiative: the premiere took place at Moscow Operetta Theatre in 1939, and the work was broadcast by Moscow Radio as well as taken up by operatic companies throughout the country.

Blanter accompanied the Red Army to Berlin in early 1945. He was commissioned by Stalin to compose a symphony about the capture of Berlin. However, when Vasily Chuikov was meeting with a German delegation led by Hans Krebs to negotiate their surrender following Hitler&#x27;s suicide, Chuikov had several uniformed war correspondents pretend to be members of his general staff in order to appear more professional and intimidating at the negotiations. But Blanter was also meeting with Chuikov at the time the delegation arrived and he could not pass as a Red Army officer as he was wearing civilian clothes. Thus, Chuikov shoved him into a closet just before the delegate entered the room. While he remained there for most of the conference, he eventually lapsed into unconsciousness from a lack of air, collapsing out of the closet and into the room just as the delegates were preparing to leave, embarrassing Chuikov and astonishing the Germans. 

Blanter wrote several other highly popular wartime songs. His 1945 song, &quot;The Enemy Burned Down His Home&quot;, about a soldier who returns from the front to find his entire family dead, became controversial when the authorities deemed it too pessimistic and banned its performance; it was performed for the first time in 1961.

Blanter&#x27;s postwar songs include &quot;The Migratory Birds Are Flying&quot; (1949), a patriotic Soviet song in which the narrator watches migratory birds fly away and asserts that he can think of no better place to be than the Motherland, and &quot;Dark-Eyed Cossack Girl&quot; (Russian: Черноглазая казачка), written especially for the bass-baritone Leonid Kharitonov.
In 1983, Blanter became a member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public, an organization created by the Soviet Union as an anti-Zionist propaganda tool. He died in Moscow in 1990 and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.

==Awards and honors==
* Stalin Prize (1946) (for the songs &quot;Under the Balkan Stars&quot;, &quot;In a way, a path far&quot;, &quot;My beloved&quot;, &quot;In the forest, front-line&quot;)
* People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR (1965)
* Order of the Badge of Honour (1967)
* People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1975)
* Hero of Socialist Labour (1983)

==References in popular culture==
Ayn Rand&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;We the Living&quot;, set in Petrograd between 1923 and 1925, has a passage devoted to the huge popularity of &quot;John Gray.&quot;

In the 1966 novel &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, Cornelius Ryan records that Blanter accompanied the Red Army into Berlin during the last days of the war and the collapse of Nazi power.

In the 2004 film, &quot;Downfall&quot;, Blanter plays a small role and is portrayed by Boris Schwarzmann. In the film, he is stuffed into the closet of Vasily Chuikov&#x27;s office, who is in a rush to meet the Nazi general, Hans Krebs.

<doc id="1139481" wikidata="Q1387877" url="?curid=1139481" title="Pass interference">
<text>In American and Canadian football, pass interference (PI) is a foul that occurs when a player interferes with an eligible receiver&#x27;s ability to make a fair attempt to catch a forward pass. Pass interference may include tripping, pushing, pulling, or cutting in front of the receiver, covering the receiver&#x27;s face, or pulling on the receiver&#x27;s hands or arms. It does not include catching or batting the ball before it reaches the receiver. Once the ball touches any defensive player or eligible offensive receiver, the above rules no longer apply and the defender may tackle the receiver or attempt to prevent them from gaining control of the ball. Once a forward pass is in the air it is a loose ball and thus any eligible receiver – all defensive players are eligible receivers – may try to catch it. When a defensive player catches a forward pass it is an interception and their team gains possession of the ball. Some actions that are defined as pass interference may be overlooked if the defender is attempting to catch or bat the ball rather than focusing on the receiver.

The intended receiver may find themselves a defender if a defensive player has a better chance to catch a forward pass. If an offensive player commits pass interference against a defensive player attempting to intercept a forward pass it is offensive pass interference.

==Variations==
Rules for pass interference differ between American and Canadian football:
* Pass interference rules in American high school and college football clearly cover only forward passes that travel beyond the neutral zone. In the National Football League (NFL), the rule is that &quot;there can be no pass interference at or behind the line of scrimmage&quot;. In Canadian football, pass interference rules are applied throughout the field of play. This leads to differences in the application of the rule on screen passes in which the intended receiver is behind the line of scrimmage:
** A defender who makes contact with an intended receiver behind the line of scrimmage cannot be called for pass interference at any level of American football, although he may still be guilty of a different foul. The NFL is specific about which foul can be called in that situation, stating that &quot;defensive actions [behind the line of scrimmage] such as tackling a receiver can still result in a 5-yard penalty for defensive holding, if accepted.&quot; In the same situation in Canadian football, the defender can be called for pass interference if his contact is deemed illegal.
** Offensive pass interference cannot be called behind the line of scrimmage in American football. In Canadian football, although the pass interference rule applies, offensive players are explicitly allowed to interfere with a defender attempting to intercept a screen pass (within certain limitations).

In the NFL, the defender may make continuous contact with the receiver within the first five yards of the line of scrimmage. Anything after that is penalized as illegal contact. Pass interference is called if the defensive player contacts the offensive player while he is trying to catch the pass, unless the defender has turned his head to face the oncoming pass and is attempting to intercept it. Accidental, glancing contact is not penalized.

In high school and college, the defender may make contact with the receiver as long as the receiver is in front of the defender. These provisions end when the pass is in the air.

In the NFL, when a team presents a punt formation and before the ball is kicked, acts that normally constitute pass interference against the end man on the line of scrimmage or against an eligible receiver behind the line of scrimmage, who is aligned or in motion more than one yard outside the end man on the line, are not considered pass interference.

==Penalties==
In the NFL and the Canadian Football League (CFL) the penalty for defensive pass interference is an automatic first down at the spot of the foul. If the foul occurs in the end zone, the ball is placed at the one-yard line (or half the distance to the goal if the line of scrimmage was inside the two-yard line). In U.S. college football and amateur Canadian football, the penalty is an automatic first down at the spot of the foul, up to a maximum of 15 yards from the previous spot. In U.S. high school rules the penalty for both offensive and defensive pass interference is 15 yards from the previous spot with the down replayed. Prior to 2013, the penalty for defensive pass interference also included an automatic first down while the penalty for offensive pass interference included a loss of down. In the NFL and CFL, the penalty for an offensive pass interference is 10 yards from the previous spot. In amateur Canadian football, the penalty is 15 yards.

In certain situations a defensive player deliberately commits pass interference against an intended receiver who would surely make a huge gain or score a touchdown were he to catch the ball. This is especially true in NCAA and amateur Canadian football, where the penalty for pass interference that occurs more than 15 yards upfield is less severe than under professional rules. In U.S. high school, if the covering official deems the interference intentional rather than incidental, 15 additional yards may be assessed (although this is seldom called).

<text>Alan John Dixon (July 7, 1927 – July 6, 2014) was an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served in the Illinois General Assembly from 1951 to 1971, as the Illinois treasurer from 1971 to 1977, as the Illinois secretary of state from 1977 to 1981 and as a U.S. senator from 1981 until 1993.

==Early life==
Born in Belleville, Illinois, on July 7, 1927, Dixon attended Illinois public schools and later earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his J.D. from Washington University School of Law. While attending the University of Illinois, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. During World War II, Dixon served in the United States Navy.

==State political career==

===General Assembly===
Dixon served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1951 to 1963 and as a member of the Illinois State Senate from 1963 to 1971, serving as Minority Whip for part of that time.

===Karl Rove and the Dixon campaign incident===
In the fall of 1970, Karl Rove, a future White House Deputy Chief of Staff in the George W. Bush administration, used a false identity to enter the office of Dixon&#x27;s campaign for Illinois Treasurer and stole 1.000 sheets of paper with campaign letterhead. Rove then printed fake campaign rally fliers promising &quot;free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing&quot;, and distributed them at rock concerts and homeless shelters, with the effect of disrupting Dixon&#x27;s rally. Dixon eventually won the election. Rove&#x27;s role would not become publicly known until August 1973. Rove told the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; in 1999, &quot;It was a youthful prank at the age of 19 and I regret it.&quot;

===1976 elections===
In 1976, Dixon was elected Illinois Secretary of State. The 1976 Illinois State election was turbulent for the Democratic Party. Outgoing Governor Dan Walker had lost the support of the party and was defeated in the primary election. Dixon&#x27;s election as Secretary of State left two years on his term as State Treasurer. To prevent Walker from appointing himself or anyone else to the position, Dixon proposed to incoming Republican Governor James R. Thompson that he would resign after Thompson was inaugurated if Thompson agreed to Dixon&#x27;s choice for State Treasurer. Dixon&#x27;s choice was Donald R. Smith, a Republican who was the ranking Civil Service employee in the State Treasurer&#x27;s office and who had agreed not to run for re-election. Dixon served as Secretary of State until 1981, when he took office as a United States senator from Illinois.

==United States Senate==
Dixon was generally considered a moderate and was less visible nationally than either of his Illinois colleagues, Charles Percy and Paul Simon, both of whom sought the presidency. In 1992, Dixon lost in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate to Carol Moseley Braun. This defeat shocked observers; at the time no senator had been defeated in a primary in over a decade and Dixon had a long record of electoral success. His vote to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court contributed to his defeat. Dixon was sharply criticized during the campaign by Braun for supporting Clarence Thomas&#x27; nomination despite allegations of Thomas sexually harassing Anita Hill.

Braun, a black woman, had the complete support of black voters, and as a known reformist liberal got a large share of liberal voters, and also attracted many women voters in what was termed &quot;The Year of the Woman&quot;. Another factor was the third candidate in the race, multi-millionaire attorney Al Hofeld. Hofeld drew away some of the moderate and conservative Democrats who normally supported Dixon. He also spent a large amount of money running advertisements attacking Dixon, weakening his support. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; ran a piece in which Eric Zorn claimed that Dixon&#x27;s voting to confirm Clarence Thomas in 1991 set off a chain of events that led to Barack Obama&#x27;s election as president in 2008.

===Later life and death===
Dixon chaired the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 1994 and 1995. After his term in the Senate, Dixon resumed practicing law with the Bryan Cave law firm in St. Louis and lived in Fairview Heights, Illinois, where he died on July 6, 2014, from natural causes just 1 day shy of his 87th birthday. His autobiography, &quot;The Gentleman from Illinois: Stories from Forty Years of Elective Public Service&quot;, was published in 2013 by Southern Illinois University Press.

==Awards==
Alan J. Dixon was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1994 in the area of government.

<text>DreamWorks Classics is an American entertainment company owned by DreamWorks Animation, a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, a division of NBCUniversal, which in turn is a subsidiary of Comcast. Founded as Classic Media in 2000 by Eric Ellenbogen and John Engelman, The studio&#x27;s library consists of acquired intellectual property catalogs and character brands, as well as the licensing rights for various third-party properties. In 2012, Boomerang Media sold Classic Media to DreamWorks Animation, who rebranded the company as DreamWorks Classics (the legal name is still Classic Media, LLC). DreamWorks Animation became a subsidiary of NBCUniversal in 2016.

==History==
Classic Media was founded by Eric Ellenbogen and John Engelman in May 2000 after acquiring the United Productions of America (UPA) catalog and assets from the estate of Henry Saperstein. Frank Biondi, the former head of Universal Studios, and film producer Steve Tisch invested in the company. Classic Media then bought most assets of The Harvey Entertainment Company on March 11, 2001. On August 16, 2001, Classic Media and Random House won a joint bid for the assets of Western Publishing, with Classic Media acquiring the entertainment division (including the Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics libraries) and Random House acquiring the Little Golden Books publishing properties. Classic then purchased much rights to the Jay Ward characters and formed Bullwinkle Studios, a joint venture with Jay Ward Productions, to manage them sometime in 2002. On October 31, 2003, Classic Media purchased the assets of the bankrupt Big Idea Entertainment catalog. By 2007, Bullwinkle Studios became converted to a functioning studio.

On April 7, 2005, the company underwent a recapitalization led by a group of investors, including Spectrum Equity Investors and existing investors headed by Pegasus Capital Advisors. Additionally, a senior debt facility of $100 million was secured through a bank group led by JP Morgan Chase Bank. With the deal, Spectrum became a majority owner over the existing investors, with a representative on the company board of directors.

In August 2006, Classic Media announced a joint venture with ION Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Corus Entertainment and book publisher Scholastic Corporation to launch Qubo, a kids&#x27; entertainment network.

On December 14, 2006, it was announced that Classic Media would be acquired by UK-based rival Entertainment Rights for $210.0 million. Before the acquisition was completed, both companies announced distribution and production agreements with Genius Products LLC, replacing the Sony Wonder deal.

Entertainment Rights fell in to administration on April 1, 2009. On the same day, Boomerang Media LLC, formed by Ellenbogen and Engelman in 2008 with equity funding from GTCR, announced that it would acquire Entertainment Rights&#x27; principal UK and American subsidiaries, including Classic Media, Inc. and Big Idea Entertainment, from its administrators. On May 11, 2009, Boomerang Media announced that the former UK and American subsidiaries of Entertainment Rights would operate as a unified business under the name Classic Media, while Big Idea would operate under its own name.

On February 20, 2010, Classic Media purchased the then-upcoming manga-inspired television series &quot;My Life Me&quot; from the bankrupt TV-Loonland AG.

Classic Media bought the &quot;Noddy&quot; and &quot;Olivia&quot; brands on March 7 and 19, respectively in 2012 from Chorion.

===Sale to DreamWorks Animation (2012–present)===
On July 23, 2012, DreamWorks Animation announced that they would acquire Classic Media for $155 million from Boomerang Media, with the deal closing in September of that year. Afterwards, Classic Media began trading as DreamWorks Classics to associate itself with its parent company, although the parent company remained under its former name.

On October 3, 2012, Classic Media made its first post-DreamWorks sale by securing licensing and distribution rights to Studio Hari&#x27;s &quot;The Owl &amp; Co&quot; outside of France and other French-speaking territories.

On September 17, 2013, DreamWorks Animation announced they had purchased the programming library of the British animation studio Chapman Entertainment, and placed distribution through DreamWorks&#x27; UK-based TV distribution operation.

On June 18, 2014, DreamWorks Animation bought the &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; brand and added it to the DreamWorks Classics portfolio.

On April 28, 2016, NBCUniversal announced it would buy out DreamWorks Animation in a $3.8 billion deal. The buyout was completed on August 22.

In January 2020, Classic Media pre-sold streaming rights to three series; &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, by CBS All Access (now as Paramount+).

<text>The Skootamatta River is a river in the Lake Ontario drainage basin in Hastings and Lennox and Addington Counties in Ontario, Canada. It flows from Joeperry Lake to join the Moira River in Tweed. The river&#x27;s name is thought to come from Ojibwa words meaning &quot;burnt shoreline&quot;.

==Course==
The river begins at Joeperry Lake in Bon Echo Provincial Park in Addington Highlands, Lennox and Addington County, northwest of Cloyne, at an elevation of . It flows south, taking in the right tributary Rainy Creek, and reaches Pearson Lake. The river continues south and empties into Skootamatta Lake at an elevation of . The right tributary Killer Creek joins at the lake. It flows south over Skootamatta Dam, continues south and reaches Slave Lake at an elevation of . It continues south over a small dam, takes in the right tributary Partridge Creek, and arrives in the community of Flinton. The Skootamatta River then flows over Flinton Dam, heads southwest, passes into Hastings County and takes in the left tributary Flinton Creek at an elevation of . The river continues south, takes in the left tributary Little Skootamatta Creek at an elevation of , and turns west just north of Highway 7. The river takes in the right tributary Elzevir Creek, heads southwest under the highway at Actinolite and runs parallel to Highway 37. It reaches its mouth at the Moira River, at an elevation of , which flows into the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario.

==History==
Until 1908, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills in the Belleville area. At one time, there was a small hydroelectric station on the river near Slave Lake which generated power for a nearby gold mine.

<doc id="1139494" wikidata="Q711631" url="?curid=1139494" title="Burton K. Wheeler">
<text>Burton Kendall Wheeler (February 27, 1882January 6, 1975) was an attorney and an American politician of the Democratic Party in Montana, which he represented as a United States senator from 1923 until 1947.

Born in Massachusetts, Wheeler began practicing law in Montana almost by chance, after losing his belongings while en route to Seattle. As the U.S. Attorney for Montana, he became known for his criticism of the Sedition Act of 1918 and defense of civil liberties during World War I. An independent Democrat who initially represented the progressive wing of the party, he received support from Montana&#x27;s labor unions in his election to the Senate in 1922.

As a freshman senator, Wheeler played a crucial role in exposing the Harding administration&#x27;s unwillingness to prosecute people involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. He ran for vice president in 1924 on the Progressive Party ticket headed by Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette Sr. An ardent New Deal liberal until 1937, Wheeler broke with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the issue of packing the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, from 1938 to 1941, he became a leader of the non-interventionist wing of the party, fighting against entry into World War II until the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Wheeler lost reelection in 1946 and retired to private practice in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Wheeler was born in Hudson, Massachusetts, to Mary Elizabeth Rice (née Tyler) and Asa Leonard Wheeler. He grew up in Massachusetts, attending the public schools. He first worked as a stenographer in Boston.

He traveled west to attend University of Michigan Law School, where he graduated in 1905. He initially intended to settle in Seattle, but after getting off the train in Butte, Montana, he lost his belongings in a poker game. The new attorney settled there and began practicing law.

==Political career==

===1910s===
Wheeler was elected as a Montana state legislator in 1910, and in that position, he gained a reputation as a champion of labor against the Anaconda Copper Mining Company that dominated the state&#x27;s economy and politics. He was appointed as a United States Attorney. During his tenure, he refused to prosecute alleged sedition cases during World War I, arguing that to do so would violate free speech. His refusal is significant as Montana was a stronghold of the Industrial Workers of the World. In other parts of the country, IWW membership was suppressed under the Sedition Act. Wheeler&#x27;s defense of free speech was seen as unpatriotic if not treasonous by conservatives. He further riled conservatives when he served as defense attorney for William F. Dunne, a socialist newspaper editor who was accused of sedition. Wheeler&#x27;s actions made him unpopular in the pro–World War I political climate, and he was forced to resign his office as a U.S. attorney in October 1918.

===1920s===
In 1920, Wheeler ran for Governor of Montana, easily winning the Democratic primary, and he won the support of the Non-Partisan League in the general election. The ticket included a multi-racial set of candidates, unusual for 1920, including an African American and a Blackfoot Indian. Wheeler was defeated by Republican former U.S. Senator Joseph M. Dixon.

Wheeler ran as a Democrat for the Senate in 1922, and was elected over Congressman Carl W. Riddick, the Republican nominee, with 55% of the vote. He broke with the Democratic Party in 1924 to run for Vice President of the United States on the Progressive Party ticket led by La Follette. They carried one state—La Follette&#x27;s Wisconsin—and ran well in union areas and railroad towns.

Early on in his career as a U.S. senator, Wheeler played a leading role in exposing the Harding administration&#x27;s unwillingness to prosecute administration officials involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. His special committee held sensational Senate hearings regarding bribery and other corruption in Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty&#x27;s Justice Department, which ultimately resulted in the indictment of Daugherty and others. He voted for the Immigration Act of 1924 which limited Catholic and Jewish immigration, and almost entirely banned Asian immigrants. In 1925, Wheeler faced investigation, without major impact, by Blair Coan, a Justice Department investigator from Chicago, who suspected Wheeler of involvement in communist conspiracy. In an otherwise negative assessment of Wheeler&#x27;s career and views, journalist John Gunther called the indictment &quot;pure vindictive retaliation, a frameup,&quot; laying the blame upon Attorney General Daugherty.

Wheeler returned to the Democratic Party after the election, which Republican Calvin Coolidge won in an Electoral College landslide. He served a total of four terms and was re-elected in 1928, 1934, and 1940.

===1930s===
In 1930, Wheeler gained national attention when he successfully campaigned for the reelection to the U.S. Senate of his friend and Democratic colleague Thomas Gore, the colorful &quot;Blind Cowboy&quot; of Oklahoma. Wheeler supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s election, and many of his New Deal policies. He broke with Roosevelt over his opposition to the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, and also opposed much of Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy before World War II. In the 1940 presidential election, there was a large movement to &quot;Draft Wheeler&quot; into the presidential race, possibly as a third party candidate, led primarily by John L. Lewis. 

In 1938, Wheeler introduced Senate Resolution 294, a &quot;sense of the senate&quot; statement that, in order to ensure fair competition, AM radio stations in the United States should be limited to a transmitter power of 50,000 watts.
Now commonly known as the Wheeler resolution, it was approved on June 13, 1938 and the next year the Federal Communications Commission implemented a 50,000 watt cap, which still remains in force.

===1940s===
====America First Committee====
Wheeler, an outspoken non-interventionist, opposed U.S. entry into World War II.

He strongly supported the isolationist America First Committee but never joined. He gave advice and many speeches to its chapters. His wife Lulu was on its national committee and she was the treasurer of the Washington, DC, chapter. Because he and other speakers at an antiwar rally, including Norman Thomas, gave the palm-out Bellamy Salute, critics drew comparisons to the Nazi salute. 
The Bellamy Salute had been widely used in the U.S. since the 1890s.

As chair of the &quot;Wheeler Committee&quot; (formally, the Subcommittee to Investigate Railroads, Holding Companies, and Related Matters of the United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce), Wheeler announced in August 1941 he would investigate “interventionists” in the motion picture industry, which his detractors characterized as anti-Semitic. He questioned why so many foreign-born favored American participation in the war. &quot;Critics charged that the Committee was motivated by animus to Jewish studio heads.&quot; Representing the studios was 1940 Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie who charged that Wheeler and other critics sought to impose the same kind of censorship that Nazi Germany was enacting all over Europe. Wheeler also led the attack on Roosevelt&#x27;s Lend Lease Bill, charging that if passed &quot;it would plow under every fourth American boy&quot;. Roosevelt in response charged that Wheeler&#x27;s statement was &quot;the damnedest thing said in a generation&quot;.

After the start of World War II in Europe, Wheeler opposed aid to Britain or France. On October 17, 1941, Wheeler said: &quot;I can&#x27;t conceive of Japan being crazy enough to want to go to war with us.&quot; One month later, he added: &quot;If we go to war with Japan, the only reason will be to help England.&quot; The United States Army&#x27;s secret Victory Program was leaked on December 4, 1941 to Wheeler, who passed this information on to three newspapers.

====World War II====
Following Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, Wheeler supported a declaration of war saying, &quot;The only thing now to do is to lick the hell out of them.&quot;

Wheeler had always considered himself to be a champion of civil liberties for unpopular groups and World War II was no exception. Agreeing with such critics of the Sedition Trial of 1944 as Senator Robert A. Taft and leading constitutional scholar Zechariah Chafee, he regarded the Sedition Trial of 1944 a “disgrace” and a scheme to smear more mainstream critics of FDR&#x27;s pre-war foreign policy. Wheeler also criticized the internment of Japanese Americans though he apparently did not speak out publicly. In 1962, he recalled that he had “protested to various high-level government officials,” including his friend Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson, asserting that internment violated the “principles of the Four Freedoms.” He warned that if the government “can get away with such treatment of citizens of Japanese descent, it can do the same to any minority.” 

In 1945, Wheeler was among the seven senators who opposed full United States entry into the United Nations.

Wheeler sought renomination in 1946 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Leif Erickson, who attacked Wheeler as insufficiently liberal and for his &quot;pre-war isolationist&quot; views. Erickson in turn was defeated by Republican state representative Zales Ecton. Wheeler&#x27;s defeat has been attributed, in part, to a pamphlet by David George Plotkin entitled &quot;The Plot Against America: Senator Wheeler and the Forces Behind Him.&quot; Published by supporters of the Communist Party, the pamphlet accused Wheeler, along with President Harry S. Truman, of being part of a fascist conspiracy. Montana writer Joseph Kinsey Howard called it &quot;one of the worst books ever written&quot; about a politician. It later emerged that the pamphlet had been backed by an aide of Jerry J. O&#x27;Connell, a political rival of Wheeler&#x27;s in Montana politics.

One political commentator characterized the fall of Wheeler&#x27;s political fortunes by the end of his career:

Though Wheeler was accused of becoming a conservative, even reactionary, he remained consistent to the Populist-Progressive tradition in blaming eastern bankers for his ills. In his early years he lumped together the eastern financial interests with capitalism; in 1946 they were partners in crime with Communism. The man was the same, as were his methods, but his sense of timing and knowledge of the Montana voter were not as acute as they had been. By 1946, Wheeler was more acceptable to conservatives than liberals.

===1950s===
On September 15, 1950, Wheeler served as counsel to Max Lowenthal, a fellow Democrat from Minnesota, as the latter testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Wheeler did not return to politics, nor full-time to Montana, but took up his law practice in Washington, D.C. Aided by research from his daughter, Frances (died 1957), Wheeler wrote his autobiography, with Paul F. Healy, &quot;Yankee from the West&quot;, published in 1962 by Doubleday &amp; Company. He dedicated the book to his wife and daughter.

==Personal life, death, and legacy==
Wheeler married Lulu M. White. She was a major political advisor. They had six children: John, Elizabeth, Edward, Frances, Richard and Marion and beloved great grandchild Willa K Snow (of Edward). Frances helped her father with his research for his autobiography, &quot;Yankee from the West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee-born U.S. Senator from Montana&quot;, which he published in 1962 and dedicated to her and his wife.

Wheeler died age 92 on January 6, 1975, in Washington, D.C., and is interred in the District of Columbia&#x27;s Rock Creek Cemetery. His Butte home is a National Historic Landmark in recognition of his national political role.

In 2004, political writer Bill Kauffman of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; described Wheeler as having been notable as an &quot;anti-draft, anti-war, anti-big business defender of civil liberties&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*The 1939 film &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; and its source material, the unpublished novel &quot;The Gentleman from Montana&quot;, were loosely based on Wheeler&#x27;s experience investigating the Harding administration.
* In Philip Roth&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; (2004), and its television adaptation, Wheeler serves as vice president during the fictional presidency of Charles Lindbergh. Roth depicted Wheeler as a political opportunist, who, while serving as acting president during Lindbergh&#x27;s absence, imposes martial law. (However, Wheeler had historically been known as a leading opponent of the martial law imposed by the Governor of Montana Sam V. Stewart during World War I.)
* In a lesser-known alternate history novel, &quot;The Divide&quot; (1980) by William Overgard, Wheeler becomes president in 1940, campaigning on a platform of isolationism despite Axis victories (far larger than those which actually occurred). When the U.S. belatedly enters the war, it is defeated in 1946 and partitioned between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and Wheeler is ultimately executed as a war criminal.

<doc id="1139500" wikidata="Q2923647" url="?curid=1139500" title="Bramley apple">
<text>Malus domestica (Bramley&#x27;s Seedling, commonly known as the Bramley apple, or simply Bramley, Bramleys or Bramley&#x27;s) is an English cultivar of apple that is usually eaten cooked due to its sourness. The variety comes from a pip planted by Mary Ann Brailsford. &quot;The Concise Household Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;Some people eat this apple raw in order to cleanse the palate, but Bramley&#x27;s seedling is essentially the fruit for tart, pie, or dumpling.&quot; Once cooked, however, it has a lighter flavour. A peculiarity of the variety is that when cooked it becomes golden and fluffy.

==Tree==

Bramley&#x27;s Seedling apple trees are large, vigorous, spreading and long-lived. They tolerate some shade. The apples are very large, two or three times the weight of a typical dessert apple. They are flat with a vivid green skin that becomes red on the side that receives direct sunlight. The tree is resistant to apple scab and mildew and does best when grown as a standard in somewhat heavy clay soil. It is a heavy and regular bearer; the apple, nicknamed the &quot;King of Covent Garden&quot;, is the only British cooking apple produced all year round.

As a triploid, the tree has sterile pollen. It needs a pollinator but cannot pollinate in return, so it is normally grown with two other varieties of apple for pollination. It has won many awards and currently holds the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (H4).
Most of the stock of Bramley&#x27;s Seedling commercially available is slightly different in its growth habit and other characteristics from the original tree, probably because of one or more chance mutations that occurred unnoticed over the years. Plants cloned from the still-surviving (then 180-year-old) tree by tissue culture in 1990 have proved to be much more compact and free-branching than the widely available commercial stock. The cloning work was done to preserve the original by scientists at the University of Nottingham, including Edward Cocking, because the original tree was suffering from old age and was under attack by honey fungus. Twelve of the cloned trees now grow in the University grounds; one was also planted beside the old tree at Southwell, but was cut down when it was 10 years old. In 2024 the artist Dan Llywelyn Hall painted a portrait of the tree in support of a campaign to help support the tree in its declining years. 

==History==

The first Bramley&#x27;s Seedling tree grew from pips planted by Mary Ann Brailsford in her garden when she was a young girl in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, UK in 1809. Mary left the house when she married and possibly never saw the apples that were produced. She died in 1852 never knowing that &quot;her&quot; seedling was to become famous. The tree she had planted in the garden was later included in the purchase of the cottage by a local butcher, Matthew Bramley, in 1846. In 1856, a local nurseryman, Henry Merryweather, asked if he could take cuttings from the tree and start to sell the apples. Bramley agreed but insisted that the apples should bear his name.

On 31 October 1862, the first recorded sale of a Bramley was noted in Merryweather&#x27;s accounts. He sold &quot;three Bramley apples for 2/- to Mr Geo Cooper of Upton Hall&quot;. On 6 December 1876, the Bramley was highly commended at the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Fruit Committee exhibition.
As a young man Henry Merryweather worked as a gardener on the nearby Norwood Park Estate in Nottingham, and when John Ralph Starkey bought the hall, gardens, and pasture in 1880, he turned to Henry Merryweather for advice about which apples and fruit he should be planting on his acreage. The Bramley Apple was suggested and the first commercial orchard of Bramley was established in 1910 at Maythorne Orchard, close to the Lower Kirklington Road on what is now a golf course.

In 1900, the original tree was knocked over during violent storms; it survived, and is still bearing fruit two centuries after it was planted. It was reported in 2016 that the tree was suffering from a fungal infection and could be dying, but it was still producing fruit in 2024, though said to be neglected. The variety is now the most important cooking apple in England and Wales, with 13.5 square miles, 95% of total culinary apple orchards in 2007.

The Bramley is cultivated almost exclusively in the British Isles, though also produced by a few United States farms, and can be found in Canada, Australia and Japan.

At the 2009 bi-centenary, a special display was presented at the Harrogate Autumn Flower Show by the great-granddaughter of Henry Merryweather. 

The town of Southwell hosts many celebrations of the Bramley Apple, including the Bramley Apple Festival launched in 2011.
On the third Saturday in October, Southwell Minster hosts the Opening Ceremony and the Food &amp; Drink Festival. The Bramley Apple Inn is located just a few doors away from the original apple tree, which is considered to be a town treasure. In 2018, 27 Church Street was bought by Nottingham Trent University to preserve the building and the tree for posterity. The tree is not open to the public, but can be visited by appointment.

A blue plaque on the house in Southwell now commemorates the apple, and in 2009 a stained glass window commemorating the 200th anniversary of the planting of the tree was installed in Southwell Minster.

==Armagh Bramleys==
Bramley apples from County Armagh in Northern Ireland have Protected Geographical Indication status within the European Union. The apples have a tarter taste than those grown in England. Over 40,000 tonnes are produced annually.

==Cooking==
Bramleys work well in pies, cooked fruit compotes and salads, crumbles, and other dessert dishes. They are also used for chutneys but only form a base for cider, due to their acidity. Whole Bramley apples, cored and filled with dried fruit, baked, and served with custard is an inexpensive and traditional British dessert. Bramleys are also used for apple sauce.

Regardless of the dish, Bramley apples are generally cooked in the same basic way. First the fruit is peeled and then sliced, and the pieces covered in lemon juice (or some other acidic juice) to stop them turning brown. Sugar is often added. In pies and crumbles, the fruit is simply covered with the topping and baked; the moisture in the apples is sufficient to soften them while cooking. The flavour may be spiced, according to taste, with cloves, mixed spice or cinnamon. To make apple sauce, the apples are sliced and then stewed with sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan.

Bramley&#x27;s Seedling apples are favoured for producing a jelly which is very pale in colour. Because the tree is a heavy cropper and liable to glut, it is a fine candidate for the domestic production of fruit wine, alone or with other fruits, and cider if mixed with a sweeter Cox or similar.

<doc id="1139521" wikidata="Q15137712" url="?curid=1139521" title="Chartered Institute for Archaeologists">
<text>The Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) is a professional organisation for archaeologists working in the United Kingdom and overseas. It was founded in 1982, and at 21 July 2020 had 3,931 members overall, of whom 3,033 were accredited professionals; it also has 80 accredited organisations.

CIfA members are drawn from across the archaeological community, and from around the world - in 2018 the membership included archaeologists from 40 countries.

Accredited membership is by election following a satisfactory demonstration of archaeological experience and competence and an undertaking to abide by the institute&#x27;s code of conduct. CIfA&#x27;s aims are to advance the practice of archaeology and allied disciplines by promoting professional standards and ethics for conserving, managing, understanding and promoting enjoyment of the heritage.

CIfA is currently based at the University of Reading.

==History==
The idea of establishing an institute for archaeologists came about in 1973 when the Council for British Archaeology set up a working party on Professionalism in Archaeology. This was due to a rapid increase in the number of employed archaeologists and the need for a body to be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of professional standards in archaeology.

In 1979 an Association for the Promotion of the Institute of Field Archaeologists (APIFA) was established. This group determined that the objectives of the proposed Institute of Field Archaeologists (IFA) should include &#x27;the definition and maintenance of appropriate standards of
* Training and education in field archaeology
* Responsible and ethical conduct in the execution and supervision of work
* Conservation of the archaeological heritage&#x27; 
In May 1980 APIFA published a draft Code of conduct; the election of the institute&#x27;s founding council was held on 21 December 1982. The first chair and Member No 1 was Professor Peter Addyman and other notable early members were Mick Aston (21), Philip Barker and Francis Pryor (15).

Recognising that archaeologists work in all aspects of the historic environment, in 2008 members voted in favour of adopting a trading name of the Institute for Archaeologists along with a rebrand to reflect this. At the 2013 AGM, members agreed that a formal petition for Royal Charter should be made to the Privy Council and on 9 December 2014 the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists was officially launched marking a significant step for the archaeological profession and bringing it in step with other chartered institutes.

==Services==
CIfA is responsible for the production and maintenance of a Code of conduct along with a variety of Standards and Guidance documents and policy statements and practice guides . It promotes the value of professional ethics and provides a number of online resources 

As well as lobbying and making representations to national and local government and other agencies on behalf of its members, it champions professionalism in archaeology. CIfA&#x27;s overall goal is for clients to engage only accredited professionals with the necessary skills to carry out archaeological services and to support this is organises conferences and training initiatives, accredits courses, provides online Continuing Professional Development facilities, and has a wide range of specialist and area networks. 

Its publications include a regular magazine &quot;The Archaeologist&quot;, and a &quot;Yearbook and Directory&quot;. Members also receive a reduction on &quot;The Historic Environment: Policy and Practice&quot;, a journal published by Taylor &amp; Francis. CIfA also holds an annual conference in spring, and its Annual General Meeting (AGM) - which usually also incorporates a training event - in the autumn. 

==Membership==

===Individual===
CIfA offers three professionally accredited grades: Practitioner (PCIfA) accreditation is open to those who have undertaken skilled tasks within the historic environment sector under the guidance of others; Associate (ACIfA) accreditation is open to those who have carried out, delegated or brought to conclusion pieces of work within the historic environment sector, with some autonomy but without holding ultimate responsibility, and Members (MCIfAs) accreditation is open to those with the highest level of responsibility within the historic environment sector with sole responsibility to initiate, negotiate, carry out and/or delegate, and bring to conclusion pieces of work. Accredited members may be professional or amateur archaeologists and are permitted to use the relevant post nominal abbreviation after their names. All accredited members have full voting rights within the institute. CIfA accreditation is recognised by the Construction Skills Certification Scheme to qualify for a CSCS card.

Affiliate and student memberships are also available. Student membership is open to students in full or part-time at under- or post-graduate level, where archaeology is studied in equal or greater weight to another subject. Student membership is retained for up to 12 months after graduation after which it is automatically transferred to Affiliate membership. Affiliate membership is open to those who have an active interest in archaeology but do not yet qualify for a accreditation.

===Organisation===
In 1996 CIfA launched a Register of Archaeological Organisations which provides a quality assurance scheme for archaeological organisations. Like with individual accreditation, in return for registration, the scheme requires organisations to comply with the Code of conduct and to work in accordance with defined policies and procedures, and current best practice.

===International===
CIfA regards itself as a UK-based organisation that operates internationally, and individual membership is open to archaeologists from any part of the world. In 2017-18 the German archaeological association DGUF worked with CIfA to set up CIfA Deutschland; the group was formally established in 2019. A CIfA Australia group was set up in the following year.

CIfA has also entered into memoranda of understanding with other archaeological associations with similar objectives. These include the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA), the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA) in the United States of America, DGUF in Germany, and the Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland (IAI). 

==Issues==
Low pay and poor job security in archaeology have been a major problem throughout the institute&#x27;s history and there is often a misunderstanding about CIfAs role, as a professional association in addressing this as opposed to a trade union or trade association. The institute has a vital role to play in improving and maintaining standards of archaeological work, and in enhancing the status of archaeologists. It believes that inadequate pay and conditions undermines the work it does in these areas and is keen to ensure that the issue of pay is proactively addressed by the whole sector. As a result CIfA has a published policy statement on pay and pushed to establish an Industry Group to discuss relevant issues within the sector with Prospect and Federation of Archaeological Managers and Employers.

<text>Der Deutsche Michel (&quot;Michael the German&quot;) is a figure representing the national character of the German people, rather as John Bull represents the English. He originated in the first half of the 19th century.

== Overview ==
Michel differs from figures that serve as personifications of the nation itself, as Germania did the German nation and Marianne the French, in that he represents the German people. He is usually depicted wearing a nightcap and nightgown, sometimes in the colors of the German flag, and represents the Germans&#x27; conception of themselves, especially in his easy-going nature and Everyman appearance. In any event, the nightgown and the night cap, which have been present in all pictorial representations of the German Michelthe first ones dating from the first half of the nineteenth centuryare also interpreted in a way that the German Michel is, in fact, a rather naive and gullible person, not prone, for example, to question the authority of the government. On the contrary, he prefers a decent, plain and quiet lifestyle.

Over the centuries, the character traits attributed to the German Michel were subject to some change. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote the most notable aspect of Deutscher Michel as portrayed in Imperial Germany was that:
 The central problem of creating a national identity in the newly unified German &quot;Reich&quot; was all of the various German states had their own histories and traditions, none of which could be used as a symbol to appeal to everybody, leading to a situation where Hobsbawm noted:

The xenophobic tendency to the Deutscher Michel character in the 19th century, whose innocence stands in marked contrast to the cunning and devious foreigners who are always trying to trick him, reflected the fact it was more easy to define the in terms of what it was against, rather than it was for. In this regard, Deutscher Michel was very different from Marianne, who was defined in a more positive way as a symbol of the French republic and its values.

A typical cartoon featuring Deutscher Michel was published in the May 1914 edition of the magazine &quot;Kladderadatsch&quot;, where Deutscher Michel is working happily in his garden with a seductive and voluptuous Marianne on one side and a brutish &quot;muzhik&quot; (Russian peasant) on the other; the message of the cartoon was that France should not be allied to Russia, and would be better off allied to Germany, since Deutscher Michel with his well-tended garden was clearly a better potential husband than the vodka-drinking &quot;muzhik&quot; whose garden is a disorderly disaster. To further reinforce the point, Deutscher Michel is pouring cold water on two chickens in a cage whose initials stand for Alsace-Lorraine, meaning that Germany can pour cold water on France&#x27;s hopes of taking back Alsace-Lorraine anytime it wants. The caption has Deutscher Michel saying that he wants peace, but if his neighbors want war, then they will get it: the message implies that Michel, for all his good-natured and easy-going ways, is utterly ferocious when angered.

In German, &quot;Michel&quot; is also the short form of Michael, though quite rare today.

<text>Emperor Hàm Nghi (, lit. &quot;entirely right&quot;, ; 3 August 1871 – 14 January 1944), personal name Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Lịch, also Nguyễn Phúc Minh, was the eighth emperor of the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty. He reigned for only one year (1884–85).

==Biography==
On 4 July 1885, a nationwide insurrection against the French broke out under the leadership of the two regents Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết. The French stormed the palace and Tôn Thất Thuyết took Emperor Hàm Nghi and three empresses into hiding. Hàm Nghi went to the hills and jungles around Laos along with Tôn Thất Thuyết&#x27;s force. While they waged guerrilla warfare against the French occupation forces, the French replaced Hàm Nghi with his brother, Đồng Khánh, who was enthroned as the Son of Heaven. In October 1888, after a series of setbacks, Hàm Nghi was hiding in an isolated house near the spring of the Nai river, with Tôn Thất Thiệp, the second son of Tôn Thất Thuyết, and a few attendants. There, he was betrayed by the head of his Muong guards, Trương Quang Ngọc, and captured on 1 November, while Thiệp was killed. He was turned over to French officers on 2 November.
==Exile and marriage==
On 12 December 1888, he was exiled to French Algeria. There he married a French Algerian woman, Marcelle Laloë, on 4 November 1904. They had three children, Prince Minh-Duc, Princess Nhu May and Princess Nhu Lý.
==Death==
Hàm Nghi died on 14 January 1944 at the age of 72, and was buried in Algiers. During his exile, he had bought the Château de Losse in Thonac, Dordogne, in southwest France. In 1965, Charles de Gaulle proposed to his daughter, Countess de la Besse, to transfer his body to Thonac, where he still lies in a simple grave. In 2002, Vietnam sent a delegation to France to seek permission from Princess Nhu Lý (De la Besse died in 2005, in her 97th year) to move her father&#x27;s remains to the former Imperial capital of Huế. Her family has so far refused.

==Honors==
Some cities in Vietnam have streets named after him.

<text>The Thracian Goths, also known as Moesogoths or Moesian Goths, refers to the branches of Goths who settled in Thrace and Moesia, Roman provinces in the Balkans. These Goths were mentioned in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries.

==History==

Emperor Valens (r. 364–378) settled Goths in Moesia and planned to use them for protection. In 382, the Thervingi received land in Moesia by treaty with Roman emperor Theodosius I.

In the 460s, the Thracian Goths were recognized &#x27; (barbarian military aid to the Romans) of the Eastern Roman Empire, and seem to have prospered. They had an annual subsidy, and some influence due to their proximity to Constantinople. In 471, the Thracian Goths under Theodoric Strabo revolted after fearing they would be removed, Emperor Leo having come under the influence of his son-in-law, general Zeno. Two years later the Pannonian Goths (Ostrogoths) under Theodemir decided to move into Thrace, presumably wanting to share the benefits of the Thracian Goths. Leo made agreements with both Gothic groups, settling the Goths under Theodemir in Macedonia and renewing Strabo&#x27;s subsidy and elevating him to &#x27;. Zeno succeeded Leo after his death in 474, while Strabo supported a coup staged by Leo&#x27;s widow to put her brother Basiliscus on the throne; however, Zeno won back power in 476 with his Isaurian troops.

In 476/77, Zeno allied himself with Theodoric Strabo&#x27;s rival, Theoderic the Great or Theoderic the Amal (r. 474–526), the successor of Theodemir, and ordered him to attack Strabo. The leader of the Thracian Goths sent an embassy to the Byzantine emperor, offering peace and blaming the Amal. Zeno believed that this offering was hiding further conspiracies, and obtained that the Byzantine senate and army declare Strabo a public enemy. Zeno planned to have the two Theoderics attack each other. He sent the Amal against Strabo, with the promise of a huge East Roman force as reinforcement (478). The Ostrogoths under king Theoderic advanced as far as Marcianopolis in Thrace in 478. The Moesian Goths prepared to cross the Balkan Mountains (Sondis), and were then told that their Roman gold awaited south of the mountain. Theoderic the Amal did not find the Roman reinforcement army he expected, but Theoderic Strabo&#x27;s army instead, in a strongly fortified camp. Strabo provoked the Amal, running in front of the Moesian Gothic camp and claiming that the leadership of the Amal had reduced the Goths to fighting each other, and only for the Roman gain, to have none of the wealth for which they had moved from their territories. With this speech recalling the common interest of the Goths, Strabo forced the Amal to ask for peace. The two Theodorics agreed to put forward a joint request to the Emperor, in order to extend Moesian Gothic territory to the south.

According to Jordanes ( 551), the Moesian Goths were taught to write by Ulfilas (311–383). They were, according to him, still present in Moesia, &quot;numerous, but poor and unwarlike, rich in nothing save flocks of various kids and pasture-lands for cattle and forests for wood ... Most of them drink milk&quot;.

<text>In personam is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;against a particular person&quot;. In a lawsuit in which the case is against a specific individual, that person must be served with a summons and complaint (in England &amp; Wales known as Particulars of Claim (CPR 1999)) to give the court jurisdiction to try the case, and the judgment applies to that person and is called an &quot;in personam judgment&quot;. 

In personam is distinguished from &quot;in rem&quot;, which applies to property or &quot;all the world&quot; instead of a specific person. This technical distinction is important to determine where to file a lawsuit and how to serve a defendant. &quot;In personam&quot; means that a judgment can be enforceable against the person wherever he/she is. On the other hand, if the lawsuit is to determine title to property (&quot;in rem&quot;) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.

<doc id="1139543" wikidata="Q5513813" url="?curid=1139543" title="General Motors 122 engine">
<text>The 122 engine was designed by Chevrolet and was used in a wide array of General Motors vehicles. The &quot;122&quot; was similar to the first two generations of the General Motors 60° V6 engine; sharing cylinder bore diameters and some parts. The &quot;122&quot; was available in the U.S. beginning in 1982 for the GM J platform compact cars and S-series trucks.

For the J-cars, it evolved through 2002 when it was replaced by GM&#x27;s [[L850 engine|Ecotec]] line of DOHC 4-cylinder engines. In the S-10 related models, it evolved through 2003 and was known as the Vortec 2200. Production ceased consistent with the replacement of the S-series trucks with the GMT 355 sub-platform.

==Generation I==

===1.8===

====L46====
The 1.8-liter pushrod engine was the first engine to power the J-body cars. Introduced with the models in 1982, the 1.8 used a two-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced and of torque. Since peak output came on at higher RPM, acceleration in these cars was quite sluggish, with a test 1982 Pontiac J2000 accelerating from in 16.3 seconds, with a  time of 20.6 seconds.

Applications:
*1982 Buick Skyhawk
*1982 Cadillac Cimarron
*1982 Chevrolet Cavalier
*1982 Oldsmobile Firenza
*1982 Pontiac J2000

===2.0===

====LQ5====
A stroked version of the 1.8-liter engine, displacing 2.0 liters, was introduced midway through 1982, to provide more low-end power for the J-cars. This engine replaced the 1.8-liter engine altogether and had throttle-body fuel injection. It produced , and . 

Applications:
*1983–1986 Buick Skyhawk
*1983–1986 Cadillac Cimarron
*1983–1986 Chevrolet Cavalier
*1983–1986 Oldsmobile Firenza
*1983–1985 Pontiac J2000/2000/Sunbird 

====LQ2====
This engine was similar to the LQ5, except that it used a two-barrel carburetor instead of a throttle-body fuel injection system. This engine was used in the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 compact pickup trucks and their Blazer and Jimmy counterparts until 1985, when it was replaced by the 2.5-liter Tech IV engine. This engine produced at 4600 rpm and at 2400 rpm.

Applications:
*1982–1985 Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15
*1982–1985 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy

==Generation II==

===2.0===

====LL8====
This engine replaced the LQ5 and was used from 1987 until 1989. It featured throttle-body fuel injection and produced and of torque.

Applications:
*1987–1989 Buick Skyhawk
*1987–1989 Chevrolet Beretta
*1987–1989 Chevrolet Cavalier
*1987–1989 Chevrolet Corsica
*1987–1988 Oldsmobile Firenza
*1987–1989 Pontiac Tempest

===2.2===

====LM3====
For the 1990 model year, GM replaced the 2.0-liter engine with a stroked version displacing 2.2 liters and using throttle-body fuel injection (TBI). Commonly called the 2.2, it produced and of torque.

Applications:
*1990–1991 Chevrolet Beretta
*1990–1991 Chevrolet Cavalier
*1990–1991 Chevrolet Corsica
*1990–1991 Pontiac Tempest

====LN2====
For 1992, the 2.2 received multi-port fuel injection (MPFI), replacing the TBI version in the J-body cars and increasing power to and of torque. In the L-body cars, it was converted straight to Sequential Fuel Injection. In 1994, all 2.2-liter engines were updated to sequential multi-port fuel injection and power increased to , with torque increasing to . The MPFI and SFI versions produced enough power to allow the 2.2 to replace the old Pontiac Iron Duke engine as the 4-cylinder offering in the S/T trucks and A-body cars. For 1996, it became known as the Vortec 2200 in the S/T trucks.

For 1998, the engine was revised for emissions regulations and became known as the 2200. This revision lowered power to at 5000 rpm, and torque to at 3600 rpm. The engine was discontinued in 2003, replaced by the 2.2-liter DOHC Ecotec engine. Although it displaces 134 cu. in, the 2.2-liter OHV is still commonly referred to as the GM 122 today, and has been reputed for its simplicity, reliability, and ease of maintenance in the J-body cars and S-series trucks, and a few L-body cars. The 2003 model LN2 is equipped with secondary air injection.

Applications:
*1993–1996 Buick Century
*1992–1996 Chevrolet Beretta
*1992–2002 Chevrolet Cavalier
*1992–1996 Chevrolet Corsica
*1993 Chevrolet Lumina
*1994-1997 Chevrolet S-10, GMC Sonoma, and Isuzu Hombre
*1993–1994 Grumman LLV
*1993–1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera
*1995–2002 Pontiac Sunfire

====L43====
The Vortec 2200 (RPO code L43) is an OHV straight-4 truck engine. This engine is equipped with secondary air injection, and is flex-fuel capable. It is entirely different from the Iron Duke, and was the last North American iteration of the GM 122 engine. The 2200 uses an iron block and aluminum two-valve cylinder head. Output is at 5000 rpm and at 3600 rpm. Displacement is with an bore and stroke. 2200s were built at GM&#x27;s Tonawanda engine plant in Buffalo. This engine was replaced by the LN2 in September 2002. This engine did not commonly come with an egr valve from 1998-2002 on the S-series trucks despite earlier versions using one. Instead a block off plate is on the back of the cylinder head. The camshaft on the 1998 model year uses a higher lift design. (0.288 inches intake and exhaust.) Meanwhile the 1999 and newer trucks use a lower lift camshaft. (0.263 inches intake and exhaust.) This was pulled from the Haynes automotive manual for the S series trucks. 

Applications:
*1998–2002 Chevrolet S-10, GMC Sonoma, and Isuzu Hombre

<text>Chairs are known to have existed since Ancient Egypt and have been widespread in the Western world from the Greeks and Romans onwards. They were in common use in China from the twelfth century, and were used by the Aztecs.

Surviving examples of chairs from medieval Europe are often ornate works associated with royalty and nobility. During the Renaissance, chairs came into more common use, their design reflecting the changing costumes and furnishings of the period. Distinctive designs developed in France and England. In modern times the range of chair designs and materials has increased enormously.

==Ancient Egyptian chairs==
Several depictions of chairs of various types have survived, from stools, benches, chairs, and thrones, both in the form of art and from extant examples preserved thanks to the dry environment of the tombs. These ancient chairs were built to stand much lower than modern examples, sometimes only 10 inches (25 cm) at the seat.

Archeologists have found evidence of their use as early as the 2nd Dynasty of Egypt of the Early Dynastic Period. An example of a 2nd Dynasty depiction of a chair, or perhaps more aptly a throne, is shown in the statuette of Pharaoh Nynetjer (c.2785–2742 BC) in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden.

==Ancient Mesopotamian chairs==
In ancient Iraq, the earliest monuments of Nineveh represent a chair without a back but with tastefully carved legs ending in lions&#x27; claws or bulls&#x27; hoofs. Others are supported by figures in the nature of caryatides or by animals.

==Greco-Roman chairs==
The earliest known form of Greek chair dates back to six or seven centuries BCE. On the frieze of the Parthenon, Zeus occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned legs; it is ornamented with winged sphinxes and the feet of beasts. The characteristic Roman chairs were of marble, also adorned with sphinxes. The curule chair was originally very similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually received a good deal of ornament.

The most famous of the very few chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica at Rome. The wooden portions are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the end of the 18th century.

==Mexican chairs==
One type of ancient Mexican chair called the icpalli is mentioned by Jacques Soustelle. The icpalli can be seen in Diego Rivera&#x27;s mural of the Aztec market of Tlatelolco, located in the Mexican National Palace. The icpalli is also featured in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis; dignitaries and emperors are depicted sitting in them.

==Medieval chairs==

The chair of Maximian in the cathedral of Ravenna is believed to date from the middle of the 6th century. It is of marble, round, with a high back, and is carved in high relief with figures of saints and scenes from the Gospels—the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt and the baptism of Christ. The smaller spaces are filled with carvings of animals, birds, flowers and foliated ornament. The Chair of St. Augustine, dating from at least the early thirteenth century is one of the oldest cathedrae is not in use.

Another very ancient seat is the so-called &quot;Chair of Dagobert&quot; in the &quot;Cabinet des médailles&quot; of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.

To the same generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily be taken to pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time acquired arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, as well as the most, ancient, English chair is that made at the end of the 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded which long since disappeared.

Passing from these historic examples we find the chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood at the head of the lord&#x27;s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.

That we are still said to sit &quot;in&quot; an arm-chair and &quot;on&quot; other kinds of chairs is a reminiscence of the time when the lord or seigneur sat &quot;in his chair.&quot; These throne-like seats were always architectural in character, and as Gothic feeling waned took the distinctive characteristics of Renaissance work. The furniture makers also covered their crude work with gold which is called gilding.

==Chinese chairs==
Before the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), the predominant sitting positions in the Han Chinese culture, as well as several of its neighbors, were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs at that time was rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In China today, both elevated living and mat level forms are still in use.

==Renaissance chairs==
In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a mark of high office, and became the customary companion of whoever could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. We find almost at once began to reflect the fashions of the hour. No piece of furniture has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women&#x27;s dress but of men&#x27;s also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a &quot;conversation chair&quot; was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.

The majority of the chairs of all countries until the middle of the 17th century were of timber (the commonest survival is oak) without upholstery, and when it became customary to cushion them, leather was sometimes employed; subsequently velvet and silk were extensively used, and at a later period cheaper and often more durable materials. In Abraham Bosse&#x27;s engraving (&quot;illustration, left&quot;), a stylish Parisian musical party of about 1630 have pulled their low chairs (called &quot;backstools&quot; in contemporary England) away from the tapestry-hung walls where they were normally lined up. The padded back panels were covered with needlework panels to suit the tapestries, or in other settings with leather, plain or tooled. Plain cloth across the back hid the wooden framing. Stools with column legs complement the set, but aren&#x27;t &quot;en suite&quot;. In seventeenth century France the bergère chair became fashionable among the nobility and was often made of walnut.

Leather was not infrequently used even for the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather is one of the most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.

==English chairs==

Although English furniture derives so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.

==Sub-Saharan African chairs==
While Ibn Battuta was visiting Mali in 1352, he mentioned the king&#x27;s interpreter sitting on a chair and beating on an instrument made of reeds. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama (the first European to visit Malindi) discussed being greeted by a king seated on a bronze chair and wearing an ornate robe trimmed in green satin.

Stools were associated with leadership in a number of cultures, including the Ashanti, the Bunyoro, the Rwanda, the Luba, and the Kuba. The stools of African leaders were often elaborately decorated. Stools were also considered extremely personal in many Sub-Saharan African cultures. The Ashanti, for example, believed that a stool held its owner&#x27;s soul. The stools of chiefs were considered especially important because chiefs were considered to be divine kings, and that the well-being of the kingdom was dependent on the well-being of the king&#x27;s soul. After a king&#x27;s death, his stool would be preserved in a shrine to preserve his soul.

==18th-century chairs==

French fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable &quot;Louis XV&quot; French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into cabriole legs that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict guild regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the &quot;menuisier&quot; alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (&quot;huissier&quot;), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable &quot;bergère&quot; (&quot;shepherdess&quot;) is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes &quot;rechampi en blanc&quot;) or left in the natural color (&quot;á la capuchine&quot;), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded &quot;boiseries&quot; for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Liège all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between c. 1725 and 1780.

In the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, even before the accession of Louis XVI, whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.

The 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize style chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.

Though some stories attribute its invention to Benjamin Franklin, historians trace the rocking chair&#x27;s origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century.

==19th-century chairs==
The Art Nouveau school produced chairs of simplicity. The Arts and Crafts movement produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the Michael Thonet bentwood No. 14 chair (bistro chair), created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today.

==20th-century and modern chairs==
The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair, moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), butterfly chair, beanbag chairs, the egg or pod chair, plywood and laminate wood chairs, and massage chairs. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Eero Saarinen also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.

<text>Saint Ignatius High School is a private Jesuit boys high school in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.

==History==
Founded in 1886 by a German Jesuit on the invitation of Bishop Richard Gilmour, the school was originally a six-year secondary school based on the German Gymnasium that was to be attended after the completion of six years of grammar school. Separate four-year high school and college programs were formed in 1902, with the college changing its name to John Carroll University in 1923 and moving out of the Cleveland location to neighboring University Heights, Ohio, in 1935.

The words and music of St. Ignatius&#x27; alma mater were composed by the school&#x27;s band director, Mikey Eaton, in August 1937. His band debuted the alma mater at halftime during a football game on October 1, 1937, replacing their customary &quot;Victory March&quot;. In 1958, St. Ignatius gave St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati permission to adapt the song.

==Campus==
Saint Ignatius High School remains at its original location at 1911 West 30th Street. The campus includes the original structure, now known as the Main Building, which was completed in 1891 and is now a designated Cleveland Historic Landmark. On January 21, 1974, Saint Ignatius was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Other buildings are Loyola Hall (originally St. Mary of the Assumption Elementary School), Clavius Science Center, Saint Mary of the Assumption Chapel (named after a church that once was located on the current campus), Gibbons Hall, Kesicki Hall (which now houses the Welsh Academy), The Carfagna Family Magis Athletic Center, Father Sullivan, S.J. Gymnasium, Murphy Field House, Kyle Field, and the O&#x27;Donnell Athletic Complex, which houses Wasmer Field and Dale Gabor Track. In addition, the $11.5 million Breen Center for the Performing Arts replaced the Xavier Center in August 2009. It houses all student performing arts programs and hosts many events for other local arts groups. A new $3.3 million cafeteria has replaced the former Student Center, stage, senior lounge, and cooking areas. It was renamed the Rade Dining Hall. Both the St. Mary of the Assumption Chapel and the Murphy Field House projects were funded and overseen by Murlan J. Murphy. From 1904 to 1917 St. Ignatius operated a summer retreat and science campus, in Vermilion, known as Loyola-on-the-Lake.

==Academics==
The school was recognized by the United States Department of Education as a &quot;Blue Ribbon School&quot; for the 1984-1985 and 2008-2009 school year.

==Fine arts program==
In 1990, a fine arts program was added to the school&#x27;s curriculum. Its most recent addition has been the Breen Center for the Performing Arts. Musical opportunities include the Wildcat Marching Band, Pep Band, Stage Band, Chorus, Steel Drum Band, Jazz Band, Liturgical Musicians, and others.

==Clubs and activities==
St. Ignatius boasts nearly 100 extra-curricular clubs and student groups, ranging from the student-led yearbook (&quot;The Ignatian&quot;) to Billiards Club. Some activities meet daily while others meet less than monthly.

The school&#x27;s Latin Club functions as a local chapter of both the Ohio Junior Classical League (OJCL) and National Junior Classical League (NJCL).

==Athletic program==
Saint Ignatius&#x27; athletic teams are known as the Wildcats and compete as an independent in the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), at the Division I level. Through the 2023–24 school year, the Wildcats have won 58 state championships across eleven sports teams, highlighted by their 13 state titles in soccer, including six consecutive titles from 2019-2024. Both the overall total of 13 and the six-year streak are the most in OHSAA history for soccer, and the school&#x27;s 58 state championships rank third overall in boys&#x27; athletic titles.

<doc id="1139552" wikidata="Q2036644" url="?curid=1139552" title="Otago Central Rail Trail">
<text>The Otago Central Rail Trail is a 150-kilometre walking, cycling and horse riding track in the South Island of New Zealand. A pioneering project for New Zealand, the successful rail trail joined the New Zealand Cycle Trail umbrella organisation in 2012, having been one of the inspirations for it.

The trail runs in an arc between Middlemarch and Clyde, along the route of the former Otago Central Railway. The trail has become a popular tourist attraction, with 10,000–12,000 users per year as a conservative estimate, and yearly (and ongoing) user increases for 6 out of the last 7 years (as of 2011). The trail is also accepted as being, by a large margin, the biggest non-farming economic factor in the Maniototo-Alexandra area.

==History==
The original railway line was completed at the turn of the 20th century, and provided a link between Central Otago and Dunedin until closure in 1990. The first 64 km from the junction with the Main South Line in Wingatui remain operational; the initial 4 km form KiwiRail&#x27;s Taieri Industrial Siding and the remaining 60 km through the Taieri Gorge to Middlemarch is operated by Dunedin Railways as a tourist attraction. The New Zealand Department of Conservation recognised that the remainder of the route to Clyde had potential as a recreational facility, and bought the formation after the rails and sleepers had been salvaged.

Since, the trail has come to be recognised as an important feature of the region, highlighted for example by strong interest from numerous groups in a 2011 workshop, where 120 people attended to discuss the further future of the trail, and how to encourage users to stay in the area for longer.

The success of the rail trail played an important role in ensuring the New Zealand Cycle Trail project succeeded in gaining funding, and was cited as an example of the kind of infrastructure the project is to provide by New Zealand&#x27;s Prime Minister John Key.

==Trail walking / cycling==
The trail starts at Middlemarch in the east, loops north through the spectacular countryside of the Strath Taieri and the Maniototo to end at Clyde, on the banks of the Clutha River. The return journey to Middlemarch or Dunedin can be made on foot or by bicycle over the historic Old Dunstan Road, used by the early gold miners to access Central Otago. It traverses open country with little accommodation or food between the typical stops. Users need to be self-sufficient for much of each day.

Towns in the area have, however, developed facilities for trail users, and companies have been developed to aid travellers on the trail, such as transporting luggage between destinations. Due to the increasing numbers of pubs now available on the track route, the trail has also been nicknamed the &#x27;Ale Trail&#x27;.

To enjoy the scenery, the engineering involved in building the railway and the towns and people along the way, 5–7 days should be allowed to walk the Trail or 3–5 days to cycle it. The trail starts at 201 metres (660 ft) above sea level in Middlemarch and rises at its highest point to 618 metres (2,028 ft) between Ranfurly and Oturehua. On the journey it passes through three tunnels (the two Poolburn Gorge Tunnels and the Prices Creek Tunnel) and over several large viaducts. A torch (flashlight) is advised for the tunnels. The trail is well maintained and signposted. Toilets are available at several points and the contours are best described as easy, having been built to allow steam trains to climb the gentle inclines even in winter, with frost on the rails.

The trail passes through or past several small towns. Mountain bikes can be rented from outlets in Middlemarch, Ranfurly, Alexandra and Clyde. Some of these cycle shops will also provide transport for riders and bikes, and will move luggage. The trail is very popular, and accommodation should be booked well in advance during busy periods such as long weekends and holidays.

The trail passes through one of the few parts of New Zealand to have a continental climate, with extremes of temperature common. Midsummer daytime temperatures frequently climb above , and winters can include entire days with a temperature staying below freezing point. One known issue on the trail can be the strong winds that can develop from the nearby mountain ranges under certain weather conditions, slowing riders going in the wrong direction to a crawl.

The manager of the trail, the Otago Central Rail Trail Charitable Trust, has a website and publishes a leaflet that provides detailed information on the route, and advertisements for businesses providing services to users of the trail. There are visitor information centres in Alexandra, Cromwell, Roxburgh, Ranfurly and Dunedin. Several books on the trail and the surrounding area can be purchased at bookshops throughout New Zealand.

== Usage / Statistics ==

The trail is used by 10,000–12,000 users per year as a conservative estimate (14,000 in other estimates) and up to 80,000 further (mostly local) users of part sections. The Poolburn Gorge section was the most popular, with around 24,000 yearly users. Trail patronage is counted using electronic counters, with the numbers at four remote locations extrapolated to estimate the whole trail usage, as not all riders ride the full trail.

The users of the trail have been shown as approximately 9% guided tour customers, 50% independent travellers (renting a bicycle) and 41% New Zealanders bringing their own bicycles.

A business evaluation has credited the trail with supporting around 1,000 full and part-time jobs, and having created 200 additional or part-time jobs.

Annual maintenance and development costs for the trail have been estimated at somewhat over $316,000.

<doc id="1139553" wikidata="Q1823301" url="?curid=1139553" title="Stud welding">
<text>Stud welding is a technique similar to flash welding where a fastener or specially formed nut is welded onto another metal part, typically a base metal or substrate. The fastener can take different forms, but typically fall under threaded, unthreaded, or tapped. The bolts may be automatically fed into the stud welder. Weld nuts generally have a flange with small nubs that melt to form the weld. &quot;Weld studs&quot; are used in stud welding systems. Manufacturers create weld studs for the two main forms of stud welding: capacitor discharge stud welding and drawn arc stud welding

== Drawn arc stud welding ==

Drawn arc stud welding joins a stud and another piece of metal together by heating both parts with an arc. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud as one of the electrodes. The polarity used in stud welding depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminium, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN).

Stud welding uses a flux tip and a ferrule, a ceramic ring which concentrates the heat, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed. This lack of marring on the side opposite the fastener is what differentiates stud welding from other fastening processes.

=== Drawn arc welding studs ===
Drawn arc studs range from a #8 to 1&quot; diameter. The lengths are variable from 3/8&quot; to 60&quot; (for deformed bars). Arc studs are typically loaded with an aluminium flux ball on the weld end which aids in the welding process. Drawn arc weld studs are commonly made from mild steel and stainless steel.

=== Short cycle stud welding ===
Short cycle stud welding is a faster form of drawn arc stud welding which can use capacitor discharge weld studs instead of drawn arc studs. This method can tolerate welding studs to thinner sheet metals than the drawn arc process, though it does not achieve welds that are as strong or penetrative. It also does not require the use of ceramic ferrules. Sometimes operators using this process use shrouding gas to reduce spatter.

== Capacitor discharge stud welding ==
Capacitor discharge stud welding differs from drawn arc stud welding, in that capacitor discharge welding does not require flux. The weld time is shorter, enabling the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter studs to be welded to thin, lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge stud welding with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn-through showing on the opposite side of very thin metals. CD stud welding is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. Drawn arc stud welding is primarily used for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs.

=== Capacitor discharge weld studs ===
Capacitor discharge weld studs range from 14 gauge to 3/8&quot; diameter. They come in many different lengths, ranging from 1/4&quot; to 5&quot; and larger. They are usually manufactured from mild or stainless steel, brass, aluminium, and aluminium alloy. The tip on the weld end of the stud serves a twofold purpose:

* It acts as a timing device to keep the stud off the base material.
* It disintegrates when the trigger is pulled on the gun.

When the tip disintegrates, it melts and helps solidify the weld to the base material.

== Automated and robotic stud welding ==
Portable stud welding machines are available. Welders can also be automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. CNC stud welding machines can increase the speed and accuracy of manufacturing and construction work. Stud welding is versatile; typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction. Shipbuilding is one of the oldest uses of stud welding, and the process revolutionized the shipbuilding industry. Other manufacturing industries can also use stud welding for a variety of purposes, from electrical and mechanical to decorative and consumer products.

==Standards==
Among the standards quoted in the list of welding codes, the following apply:

*ISO 13918 - Welding - Studs and ceramic ferrules for arc stud welding
*ISO 14555 - Welding - Arc stud welding of metallic materials

<doc id="1139560" wikidata="Q286751" url="?curid=1139560" title="Wasted spark system">
<text>A wasted spark system is a type of ignition system used in some four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines. In a wasted spark system, the spark plugs fire in pairs, with one plug in a cylinder on its compression stroke and the other plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark during the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus &quot;wasted&quot;. This design halves the number of components necessary in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2–3 kV to fire the cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The remaining coil energy is available to fire the spark plug in the cylinder on its compression stroke (typically about 8 to 12 kV).

==Advantages==
Perhaps the most significant advantage of the system, compared to a single coil and distributor systems, is that it eliminates the high-tension distributor. This significantly improves reliability, since many problems with a conventional system are caused by the distributor being affected by dampness from rain or condensation, dirt accumulation, and degradation of insulating materials with time. Although plug-top coil systems would later offer this same advantage, they were not available for another 30 years. Plug-top systems increase the number of coils required, increase the heat that these coils must survive and thus require more sophisticated and expensive materials to survive routine usage.

==Timing signal==
Wasted spark systems still require a timing signal from the crankshaft. In a conventional four-stroke engine, this signal must also observe the phase of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft, so contact breakers are normally driven from the camshaft and distributor drive. With a wasted spark, the crankshaft can be used instead, as the system fires on both upward strokes. It simplifies the mechanical arrangements since there is no distributor drive and the contact breaker cam can be fixed to the crankshaft. Although a 2:1 reduction gear is still required to operate the camshaft and valves, the precision of this drive is now less critical (ignition timing is more critical for engine performance than valve timing): engines continue to run adequately even with worn camshaft drives and imprecise timing.

==Practical examples of &#x27;wasted spark&#x27;==

This system has been widely used, including such engines as the MG MG6 1.8T engine; Mitsubishi Evolution 4G63 engine, Fiat 126 engine, Mercedes-Benz inline sixes (M104.94x, M104.98x, M104.99x); Buick 3800 engines (LN3 and newer); Harley-Davidson V-Twin; air-cooled BMW Motorcycles; Citroën 2CV, Mazda B engines; Chrysler V10s; GY6 engine; Volkswagen Golf Mk3 2.8 VR6 (other than 2.0); Saturn Corporation four cylinders; Toyota 5VZ-FE V6s; Toyota 5E-FE and Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 &amp; 2.4 engines. Some Ford engines also do. Many Honda and Kawasaki motorcycle and PWC engines also follow a similar design, to allow for a smaller number of more powerful coils to replace a larger number of smaller coils in the same limited space.

In practical use, a V-6 engine would only need three coil packs instead of six. The coilpack fires the spark plugs in two cylinders simultaneously so for example 1&amp;4/2&amp;5/3&amp;6 cylinders fire together, the spark plug in one cylinder on a compression stroke is where the power comes from, and the spark plug in the other cylinder on an exhaust stroke does nothing. Coils in a wasted spark system may be in pack form, or they may be in Coil-On-Plug (COP) form, with a spark plug cable attached to each COP unit, which connects to another spark plug.

==Single cylinder use==
Most single cylinder [four-stroke] engines use the wasted spark system in order to capitalise on the simplicity and reliability of the flywheel magneto. These engines need a flywheel to run smoothly, and the heavy current-generating magnets help provide the momentum while delivering a zero-maintenance drive to the ignition system. Bolted to the end of the crankshaft, this flywheel rotates twice for each compression stroke.

As well as the build-weight and maintenance advantages of this system, there is a tuning advantage. Mounted directly on the end of the crankshaft, all the stress that spark generation would otherwise place on the camshaft chain (or another special purpose half-speed drive) is avoided, while there is virtually none of the strain that necessarily degrades the ignition timing in systems relying on chains or gears.

Unlike the multi-cylinder systems noted above (which fire two plugs simultaneously from a double-ended coil) the coil in this system has only a single HT lead running to the single plug. The flywheel magneto provides other services in, for instance, small motorcycles, as it can easily be built to provide direct-current battery-charging power at almost no additional cost or weight.

==Effect on component life==
In modern conditions, this method has a very small impact on the length on the service intervals of the vehicle and the longevity of individual components. Modern ignition systems do not have breaker points, which have been almost entirely replaced by electronic systems. Modern ignition coils outlast most other components of the vehicle and modern spark plugs have excellent service life, though there is a slight difference between the two plugs as to erosion suffered at the center electrode. Because the spark jumps in opposite directions on the companion plugs, one bank will erode the center electrode more, and the opposite bank will erode the ground electrode more. Spark plugs used in wasted spark systems should have precious metals, such as platinum and/or iridium, on both the central and ground electrodes in order to increase the average service interval time before replacement is needed.

== Twin plug combustion ==
Since the earliest gasoline engines twin spark systems have been used, with two spark plugs for each cylinder. Each set of plugs is supplied separately. Reasons for this include reliability (especially as a failsafe in aircraft engines), for improved starting, and for better combustion performance by initiating the flamefront at opposing points simultaneously (e.g. Alfa Romeo). These are not considered as wasted spark systems since their sparks all take place after the useful compression stroke rather than &quot;wasted&quot; in the exhaust stroke.

<text>Inaccessible Island is a volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, south-west of Tristan da Cunha. Its highest point, Swale&#x27;s Fell, reaches , and the island is in area. The volcano was last active approximately one million years ago and is now extinct.

Inaccessible Island is part of the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha, which is part of the overseas territory of the United Kingdom known as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da Cunha itself is accessible only by sea via a seven-day voyage from Cape Town, South Africa, and the harbour on Inaccessible Island allows access for only a few days of the year. Access to Inaccessible Island must be granted by the local government office.

==Geography==

The island is approximately to the southwest of the main island of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago. Mostly desolate and inhospitable, the island has a few small, rocky beaches that host penguins and subantarctic fur seals. Generations of sailors were wary of the difficult landing and inhospitable terrain. Inaccessible Island has been without permanent inhabitants since 1873.

Along with Gough Island, Inaccessible Island is a protected wildlife reserve, and both make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands. Inaccessible Island is home of the endemic Inaccessible Island rail, the world&#x27;s smallest extant flightless bird.

==History==

Inaccessible Island was discovered in January 1656 during a voyage by the &quot;Nachtglas&quot; (&quot;the night glass&quot;), a Dutch ship under the command of Jan Jakobszoon, 146 years after Tristan da Cunha was first sighted by Portuguese sailors. Jakobszoon originally named it &quot;Nachtglas&quot; island.

There are two explanations for the name &quot;Inaccessible&quot; Island. One is that on maps the newly found island was referred to as &quot;inaccessible&quot; because the Dutch crew who landed were not able to reach its interior. The other claims that French captain d&#x27;Etcheverry renamed the island in 1778 after not being able to land.

In 1803, US sailors led by Amasa Delano made landfall on the island during a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope.

The brothers Gustav and Frederick Stoltenhoff arrived on Inaccessible from Germany in 1871 and lived there for two years intending to make a living sealing and selling their wares to passing traders, though such trade was minimal. Due to the scarcity of food, they were &quot;overjoyed&quot; to be rescued in 1873 during &#x27;s visit to examine the flora and fauna there. The South African author Eric Rosenthal chronicled the Stoltenhoffs&#x27; adventure in 1952. The nearby Stoltenhoff Island is named for the brothers.

In 1922, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition&#x27;s ship, the , stopped by Inaccessible briefly, and on-board naturalist Hubert Wilkins discovered a bird later named the Wilkins finch (&quot;Nesospiza wilkinsi&quot;). In 1938, the Norwegian Scientific Expedition to Tristan da Cunha spent three weeks on the island, during which time they managed to gain access to the plateau and extensively catalogued plants, birds, and rocks. Another attempt at mapping the island was made during the Royal Society&#x27;s expedition of 1962 to Tristan da Cunha, which took scientists to Inaccessible Island. Like many other explorers before them, the scientists were not able to reach the interior of the island.

Inaccessible Island was declared a nature reserve under the Tristan da Cunha Conservation Ordinance of 1976. Tristan islanders, however, were still permitted to harvest seabirds from the island. In a 1982 expedition (16 October 1982 – 10 February 1983), students and faculty of Denstone College in England made detailed maps of the island, studied its flora, fauna, and geology, and carried out a bird ringing programme on more than 3,000 birds.

In 1997, Inaccessible Island&#x27;s territorial waters out to were declared a nature reserve under the Tristan da Cunha Conservation Ordinance of 1976. Currently, only guides from Tristan are allowed to take visiting cruise ships to Inaccessible; most trips to the island are now made at the request of expatriates. In 2004 Inaccessible Island was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough Island to create a new site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands.

===Shipwrecks===

At least three confirmed shipwrecks have occurred off the coast of the island. The first was , a British ship which set sail in 1821 with 54 passengers and crew aboard, her destination Bombay. Captain Alexander Grieg intended to sail past Saint Helena, but adverse currents carried her to Tristan da Cunha. She got caught in seaweed, and on 22 July, drifted aground on Inaccessible Island. All but two of those aboard survived the shipwreck. They spent the next four months subsisting on wild celery, seals, penguins, and albatross. They managed to build a boat some months later. The first attempt to sail to Tristan failed, resulting in the loss of six people; the second attempt alerted the Tristanians to their plight. The remainder were then brought to Tristan, where the brig &quot;Nerina&quot; arrived about two months later and took most to Cape Town, South Africa.

The other two shipwrecks are the wreck of &quot;Shakespeare&quot; at Pig Beach in 1883, and &quot;Helenslea&quot; at North Point in 1897.

==Flora and fauna==

When Corporal William Glass and his family became the first settlers at Tristan da Cunha in 1816, goats and pigs were brought to Inaccessible Island to serve as a source of food. Cattle, sheep, and dogs were introduced to the island during its history. Domestic animals helped to keep the Stoltenhoff brothers alive during their expedition. All remaining domestic animals were removed during the 1950s.

No land mammals, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, or snails have been found at Inaccessible. The island has 64 native plant species, including 20 types of flowering plants and 17 species of ferns. 48 invertebrate species exist on the island, 10 of which were introduced. Subantarctic fur seals and southern elephant seals have been seen at the island in increasing numbers, and cetaceans live in the surrounding waters: most notably, southern right whales and a resident population of dusky dolphins.

===Birds===

Inaccessible is the exclusive habitat of the Inaccessible Island rail, the world&#x27;s smallest living flightless bird. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds and its endemic landbirds. Birds for which the IBA is significant include northern rockhopper penguins (up to 27,000 breeding pairs), Tristan albatrosses (2–3 pairs), sooty albatrosses (200 pairs), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (1,100 pairs), broad-billed prions (up to 500,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), spectacled petrels, great shearwaters (up to 2 million pairs), little shearwaters (up to 50,000 pairs), white-faced storm petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), white-bellied storm petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), Antarctic terns, Inaccessible rails (up to 5,000 pairs), Tristan thrushes (1,500-7,000 individuals across the Tristan da Cunha archipelago), and Inaccessible Island finches (around 24,000 individuals).

==In popular culture==

* Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; alluded to Nightingale Island, Inaccessible Island, and Tristan da Cunha.
* In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;The Thirteen-Gun Salute&quot; (1989), pp. 120–29, Captain Aubrey&#x27;s ship &quot;Diane&quot;, in a dead calm, is carried toward Inaccessible Island by the onshore current. One sailor recounts the wreck of a whaling ship that he witnessed when it was lost with all hands in similar conditions. Only a fortunate breeze saves Aubrey&#x27;s ship. The episode is depicted in the cover painting of the book showing the towering cliffs plunging directly into the sea.
* &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, the pseudonym of &quot;a serving naval officer&quot; (Geoffrey Martin Bennett), wrote &quot;The Phantom Fleet&quot; (1946), predicated on the supposition that Inaccessible Island contained a natural harbour, the entrance to which was concealed from the sea. The antagonists were assembling a fleet of obsolescent warships in this harbour, with the intention of striking a coup de main leading to world domination, a scheme foiled by the derring-do of a naval officer and the guns of the Royal Navy.
* Eric Newby passed within sight of Inaccessible Island on his 1938–1939 voyage from Ireland to Australia aboard &quot;Moshulu&quot;, as chronicled in his books &quot;The Last Grain Race&quot; and &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot;. It was the only land that the crew saw on the voyage until reaching Australia, and was therefore a cause for some excitement.

<text>Rožňava (, , Latin: &quot;Rosnavia&quot;) is a town in Slovakia, approximately by road from Košice in the Košice Region, and has a population of 19,182.

The town is an economic and tourist centre of the Gemer. Rožňava is now a popular tourist attraction with a beautiful historic town centre. The town is an episcopal seat. It has above all food, textile and remnants of mining industries.

==History==
Archaeological finds show that the region was densely settled by miners as early as around 1200. The first written mention stems from 1291, the royal free town status from 1410. The Roman Catholic diocese of Rozsnyó was founded in 1776.

In the Middle Ages, Rozsnyó was a prosperous mining town for gold, silver, and iron. Mining activities stagnated from the 16th century (when territories to the south of the town were conquered by Ottoman Turks). Mining - this time mainly of iron ore - was renewed around 1800 and was present in the town throughout the 20th century. It was ruled by Ottoman Empire as part of Filek sanjak (Its centre was Rimaszombat) during periods of 1554-1593 and 1596–1686. It was known as &quot;Rojna&quot; during Ottoman period.

The name of the town probably derives from the German word for rose (&quot;Rose, in the German name of the town &quot;Rosenau&quot;&quot;).
Until 1920 it was part of Gömör és Kishont County of the Kingdom of Hungary, and again from 1938 to 1945.

During World War II, Rožňava was captured on 23 January 1945 by troops of the Romanian 4th Army, acting as a part of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front.

On 13 September 2003, Rožňava was visited by Pope John Paul II.

<text>Guadalupe is a civil parish in the municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa, on the island of Graciosa in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,096, occupying an area of .

==History==

The fertile lands were first settled in the early 16th century, resulting in narrow parcels radiating from north to south.

Guadalupe became the centre of cereal production on the island, with the lands acquired by many of the principal families of Santa Cruz. Consequently, many of the great houses obtained their wealth from the fields and pasturelands in the west.

The parish was created in 1644, following the disaggregation of the western half of the municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa, which was then part of the Vila da Praia) and the parish of Santa Cruz da Graciosa.

With a population exceeding 3000 inhabitants by the 19th century, for many years the parish was the most populous centre of the island, surpassing the populations in the principal urban centres: Praia and Santa Cruz.

==Geography==
The parish of Guadalupe is constituted by several agglomerations, aligned in a dispersed-oriented form along the islands main roadways. It is a multi-polar structure, highlighted by isolated centres that include some residences, churches, schools and impérios, while the majority of homesteads are dispersed along the roadways. The parish is therefore an administrative entity, rather the a social construct; residents are adhere, therefore, more to their locality, rather than the parish.

The principal localities in the parish, include:
* Guadalupe, the parish centre and location of the parochial church, situated in the heart of the Courelas plain, a zone of fertile lands. With connection to the Santa Cruz, some away, it is the point of convergence of the road network to the northwest and centre. The urban area includes the locations of Pontal, Cruz do Barro Branco (which had its own school until 2003), Pé de Ladeira and, partially, Feteira (sites linked along the axis that connected Guadalupe with Luz), locally known as &quot;Sul&quot;, owing to the valley formed between Serra das Fontes (in the north) and Serra Dormida (south);
* Vitória, a settlement that occupied the extreme northwest of the island, between the volcanic spatter cones of Pico das Bichas, Pico da Brasileira and Pico das Terças. Its hermitage, situated in Beira-Mar da Vitória, was dedicated to &quot;Our Lady of Victories&quot;, was constructed in 1623 in commemoration of the victory Graciosenses over the Barbary coast pirates on 19 May 1623, in Afonso do Porto (today Porto Afonso). The place had (until the late 20th century) two primary schools, constructed by former residents who had made their fortunes in Brazil, at the end of the 19th century. In addition to the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Vitória, the curate of Vitória, instituted in 1886, includes the Church of Santo António, constructed between 1904 and 1907, through contributions from the emigrante community in Brazil and North America, while two impérios were constructed, in Beira-Mar da Vitória (1918) and in Santo António da Vitória (1914). The area of Terra do Conde is celebrated for its wine production and vineyards.
* Ribeirinha, is a locality situated north of Serra Branca, between the localities of Brasileira and Almas, is constituted by five agglomerations, that correspond to the axis that converge (from the localities of Alto da Ribeirinha, Caldeiras, Pedreiras, Esperança Velha and Grotas). These roadways converge at the settlements centre, dominated by the Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperança, square and bandshelter (inaugurated on 30 July 1967), império and old primary school (closed in 2003). The Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperança was constructed in 1847 and expanded in 1898. The hall was constructed by the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, equipped with traditional kitchen, used by gatherings of seniors, functioning as community civic centre at times. In the area of Esperança Velha a cross identifies the place of the primitive 17th century church, long since destroyed.
* Brasileira, a small place situated in a valley fronting the sea, between Pico da Brasileira, Pico das Terças and Pico das Caldeiras, constituted by an urban area and locality of Jorge Gomes. Without its own hermitage or school, the zone is an extension of Ribeirinha. It was in this locality that, on 13 July 1929, an Amiot 123 titled &quot;Marszałek Piłsudski&quot; piloted by Ludwik Idzikowski crashed, killing the aviator. The plane became lost during the pilot&#x27;s attempt at crossing the Atlantic, departing from France and destined for New York, the plane tried to land, lost control and crashed: the local is marked by a cross.
* Almas, is a locality along the axis linking Guadalupe to the Serra Dormida, marked by a school (closed in 1993), Hermitage of São Miguel Arcanjo (dedicated in the 18th century) and império (from 1963). The locality includes the place of Tanque and Manuel Gaspar. Tanque is marked by an interesting reservoir, associated with three springs, dating from the 17th century, encircled by a complex of washhouse.

This fertility and open space made settlement and population growth rapid, especially between the end of 15th century and 1550. With increased poverty, the population began to decrease, resulting in an exodus to the United States by the second half of the 20th century.

<doc id="1139568" wikidata="Q5133609" url="?curid=1139568" title="Climate of Virginia">
<text>The climate of Virginia, a state on the east coast of the United States, is mild compared to more northern areas of the United States such as New England and the Midwest. Most of Virginia east of the Blue Ridge mountains, the southern part of the Shenandoah Valley, and the Roanoke Valley, has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). In the mountainous areas west of the Blue Ridge, the climate is warm-summer humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) or oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). Severe weather, in the form of tornadoes, tropical cyclones, and winter storms, impacts the state on a regular basis. Central Virginia received significant snowfall of 20 inches in December 2009.

==Climate zones==

The USDA Hardiness Zones for Virginia range from Zone 5A (-20°F to -15°F) in the mountains, to Zone 8B (15°F to 20°F) in areas of the Hampton Roads region. 

A lot of variations occur because of the state&#x27;s significant relief. Elevations in Virginia vary from sea level to Mount Rogers at 5,729 ft (1,746 m) above sea level, with major gradations occurring at the edges of the Atlantic Ocean, the end of the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge and Allegheny chains of the Appalachian Mountains. The moderating influence of the ocean from the east, powered by the Gulf Stream, also creates the potential for hurricanes near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. Cold air masses arrive over the mountains, especially in winter, which can lead to significant snowfalls when coastal storms known as noreasters move up the Atlantic coast.

The interaction of these elements with the state&#x27;s topography create micro-climates in the Shenandoah Valley, the mountainous southwest, and the coastal plains that are slightly but noticeably distinct from each other.

==Statistics for selected cities==
The highest recorded temperature is at Balcony Falls on July 15, 1954, and the lowest recorded temperature is at Mountain Lake on January 22, 1985.



==Severe weather==
Severe weather is a concern in Virginia. Hurricanes make the coastal area of Virginia vulnerable. Hurricane Isabel in 2003 brought much destruction from wind and rain, killing 10 directly and doing nearly two billion dollars in damage. Hurricane Gaston in 2004 inundated Richmond after moving ashore South Carolina. Virginia is often struck with the remnants of systems which hit along the Gulf of Mexico coastline, which also bring torrential rain to the state. Hurricane Camille was an extreme example, bringing of rainfall to portions of Nelson County in a matter of hours. Thunderstorms are an occasional concern with the state averaging anywhere from 35 to 45 days of thunderstorm activity annually.

Rainfall in Virginia is frequent, but does not normally get severe enough for floods. Virginia averages seven tornadoes annually, though most are F2 and lower on the Fujita scale. However, Virginia had eighty-five in 2004. Western Virginia has a lower rate of tornadoes.

== Climate change ==
==Seasons==
Winter in Virginia is characterized by large swings in temperature throughout and between days. This does not happen every day of the month, however. It may be 50°F and windy one morning, and 70°F and calm the next afternoon. Winters are cool; temperatures usually range from the 40s to the 60s Fahrenheit in December; while in January, it typically is at or below freezing, especially in the mountains and the north, but can still be mild in the eastern and southern parts of the state, with temperatures in the 50s and 60s not uncommon. Snowfall is highly variable, occurring more heavily in some years, while in others it can be almost nonexistent. The most snow-prone region of the state is the Blue Ridge. Significant snowfall is most likely in Northern Virginia.

In the summer, temperatures are hot and humid. Precipitation is slightly greater. Temperatures are not extreme, ranging between the high 70s and mid 90s; but humidity can make it feel hotter.

As for sunlight, Virginia is about average in state rankings. Areas on the Chesapeake Coast and Eastern Shore are brightest, while the west and north of the state is more cloudy. On the Winter Solstice, Virginia gets between 9 and 10 hours of sunlight. On the summer solstice, it gets between 14.5 and 15 hours.

<text>The 19th (Western) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army, formed in the Great War.

==Formation history==
The 19th (Western) Division was created under Western Command in September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, from men volunteering for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. The division, whose first commander was Major General Charles Fasken, a 59-year old Indian Army officer brought out of retirement, was formed as part of Kitchener&#x27;s Second New Army (K2) and, in common with most other newly-raised Kitchener units, there was a severe shortage of trained officers and NCO&#x27;s to train the men, alongside a lack of modern equipment, training facilities and billets. However, by June 1915, training had progressed well and the division was sent to the Western Front, where it remained for the rest of the war.

<doc id="1139574" wikidata="Q291087" url="?curid=1139574" title="Hannibal Rising">
<text>Hannibal Rising is a psychological horror novel by American author Thomas Harris, published in 2006. It is the fourth and final novel in Harris&#x27;s series and the first novel in chronological order of the novels of Thomas Harris centered around Dr. Hannibal Lecter, serving as a prequel to his three previous books featuring his most famous character, the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The novel was released with an initial printing of at least 1.5 million copies and met with a mixed critical response. Audiobook versions have also been released, with Harris reading the text. The novel was adapted (by Harris himself) into a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Peter Webber. Producer Dino De Laurentiis implied around the time of the novel&#x27;s release that he had coerced Harris into writing it under threat of losing control over the Hannibal Lecter character, accounting for the perceived diminished quality from Harris&#x27; previous books.

== Plot==
Opening in Lithuania during 1941, Hannibal Lecter is eight years old and living in a castle with his parents and sister, Mischa. With the castle located near the eastern front of World War II, the Lecter family escapes to their lodge to elude the advancing German troops. With the castle abandoned, it is soon raided by Germans and civilians aiding them, their hidden art collection being among the stolen loot. Three years later, an advancing Soviet tank stops at the Lecter family&#x27;s lodge looking for water, only to be bombed by a German Stuka, the explosion killing all but the children. Surviving in the lodge, Hannibal and Mischa are captured when six deserters appear: Vladis Grutas, Zigmas Milko, Bronys Grentz, Enrikas Dortlich, Petras Kolnas and Kazys Porvik. Storming and looting the lodge, they lock the Lecters in the barn. Running low on supplies, the soldiers soon take Mischa; realizing they intend to cannibalize her, Hannibal tries to stop them, only to have his arm broken before he blacks out.

Hannibal is later spotted by a Soviet tank crew, wearing shackles and rendered mute. Returned to Lecter Castle, now a Soviet orphanage, Hannibal is found to be irreparably traumatized by the ordeal. Removed from the orphanage by his uncle Robert Lecter, Hannibal goes to live with him in France with his aunt, Lady Murasaki. Visiting a marketplace with his aunt, Lecter assaults butcher Paul Momund when he insults Murasaki. Count Lecter, learning of the slight against his wife, violently confronts the butcher and collapses and subsequently dies from a heart attack. Losing most of the Count&#x27;s estate to death duties, Lecter and Murasaki move across France, and Lecter flourishes as a medical student, assisting by preparing cadavers for lessons.

Locating Momund the butcher, Lecter murders him for his actions, eviscerating and beheading him before eating his cheeks. Suspected by Inspector Popil, Lecter escapes suspicion when Murasaki falsifies evidence, suggesting Momund&#x27;s death was political. Using sodium thiopental to recall the lodge, Lecter remembers Mischa&#x27;s murder and her killer&#x27;s faces, and that the lodge was shelled; the building burning and soldiers fleeing, Lecter was freed by Porvik, who was then crushed by falling debris. Working with Popil to recover his family&#x27;s stolen art, Lecter attends a recovered art exhibition with Murasaki, and speaks with one of Grutas&#x27; men selling the art. Afraid he will uncover their identities, Grutas sends Dortlich to murder him.

Returning to the dilapidated lodge, Lecter searches the ruins and finds a bag of buried loot, which also contains the hidden dogtags of his captors. Attacked by Dortlich, Lecter strikes him with his shovel, and ties him to a tree stump. Noosed to a horse, Dortlich confirms Grentz relocated to Canada, and that Kolnas owns a restaurant in Fontainebleau; despite his pleas, Lecter uses the horse to tear off Dortlich&#x27;s head. Returning to France, Lecter is kissed by Murasaki, who insists that he promise to stop killing and to co-operate with Popil; Lecter responds that he already promised revenge for Mischa, and leaves. Lecter continues his studies only to be stalked during his night-shift by Milko. Outwitting Milko and drugging him, Lecter interrogates him for information on Grutas, before drowning him in an embalming tank and incinerating his remains.

Eating at Kolnas&#x27;s restaurant, Lecter notices his daughter is wearing Mischa&#x27;s stolen bracelet. Entering Grutas&#x27;s property, Hannibal sets an improvised bomb and confronts him as he bathes, only to be interrupted by Grutas&#x27;s guards. As Lecter is about to be killed, his bomb detonates and cuts the power, allowing him to wound the guards and escape in the chaos. Returning to Murasaki&#x27;s home, Lecter receives a call from Grutas, who threatens to kill her unless he surrenders; overhearing ortolans singing in the background of the phone call, Lecter breaks into Kolnas&#x27;s home, and then heads to his restaurant. Lecter shows he took Mischa&#x27;s bracelet from his daughter and, in exchange for information, offers to spare Kolnas and free his family. Giving up the location of Grutas&#x27;s houseboat, Kolnas then realizes Lecter was lying about holding his family. Attacked by Kolnas, Lecter fatally stabs him through the head with a tantō.

Finding and reaching the boat, Lecter sneaks aboard but is wounded by the captain. Killing the guards and captain, Lecter rushes to save Murasaki, only to be shot in the back by Grutas, who boasts while molesting a bound Murasaki. Lecter removes his tantō, dimpled by Grutas&#x27;s bullet, and uses it to cut both of Grutas&#x27;s Achilles tendons. With Grutas disarmed, Murasaki begs Lecter to spare him for Popil, only for Grutas to mock him. Taunting that Lecter drank broth made from Mischa, he suggests Lecter kills only to continue lying to himself; enraged, Lecter carves several &quot;M&quot;s into Grutas, fatally wounding him. Horrified by Lecter, Murasaki declares there is nothing human left inside him to love, and dives overboard. Detonating the houseboat with an improvised explosive, Lecter flees the scene.

Arrested by Popil, Lecter is soon freed when popular support for his dispatch of war criminals combines with a lack of hard evidence. Lecter meets with Murasaki, and they say their goodbyes and part. Offered a residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, Lecter heads overseas to North America, stopping briefly to visit bar-owner Grentz in Quebec, Canada.

== Development ==
The February 22, 2007 issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; features a quote that suggests that the only reason Thomas Harris wrote the story was out of the fear that a Lecter prequel/origin story would inevitably be written without his involvement. &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; film producer Dino De Laurentiis said &quot;I say to Thomas, &#x27;If you don&#x27;t do [the prequel], I will do it with someone else... I don&#x27;t want to lose this franchise. And the audience wants it...&#x27; He said, &#x27;No. I&#x27;m sorry.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;I &quot;will&quot; do it with somebody else.&#x27; And then he said, &#x27;Let me think about it. I will come up with an idea.&#x27;&quot;

<text>An agricultural show is a public event exhibiting the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with agriculture and animal husbandry. The largest comprise a livestock show (a judged event or display in which breeding stock is exhibited), a trade fair, competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of farmers, animal fanciers, cowboys, and zoologists may be displayed. The terms &quot;agricultural show&quot; and &quot;livestock show&quot; are synonymous with the North American terms county fair and [[state fair]].

==History==

The first known agricultural show was held by Salford Agricultural Society, Lancashire, in 1768.

==Events==

Since the 19th century, agricultural shows have provided local people with an opportunity to celebrate achievements and enjoy a break from day-to-day routine. With a combination of serious competition and light entertainment, annual shows acknowledged and rewarded the hard work and skill of primary producers and provided a venue for rural families to socialise. City shows also provide city people with an opportunity to engage directly with rural life and food production.

Agriculture shows are often enlivened with competitive events, including sheaf tossing, show jumping, food competitions, and tent pegging. Demolition derbies and rodeos are popular in the US and campdrafting and wood chopping are often held in Australia.

Studs are generally available for a fee.

===Livestock shows===
A livestock show is an event where livestock are exhibited and judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standard. Species of livestock that may be shown include pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, llamas, and alpacas. Poultry such as chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys, and pigeons are also shown competitively. There are also competitive shows for dogs, sheepdogs, and cats.

Prize-winners at agricultural shows are generally awarded inscribed medals, cups, rosettes or ribbons. The National Museum of Australia has a rare collection of medals documenting the history of agricultural shows and rural industries across Australia. The 111 medals range in date from the mid-19th to the early 20th century and many are associated with significant individuals and organizations.

===Field days===
Related to a show is the &quot;field day&quot;, with elements of a trade show for machinery, equipment and skills required for broadacre farming. Field days typically do not involve livestock, show bags or sideshows, but may include events such as ploughing competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. In some communities in northern England Field Days (or Club Days) have lost their agricultural character and have become community celebrations.

The events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics, such as the talk on the yellow-flowering alfalfa at the South Dakota field day. Pecan growers were given a talk on insect control by an entomologist at a recent field day at LSU AgCenter&#x27;s Pecan Research/Extension Station in Shreveport, La.

A Landcare survey conducted in 1992/93 revealed that field days in Australia have a high value among local farmers. New Zealand&#x27;s National Agricultural Fieldays is held annually in June at Mystery Creek, near Hamilton, New Zealand, and attracts 1,000 exhibitors and over 115,000 visitors through its gates. Smaller shows, held annually in New Zealand&#x27;s towns and communities, are generally called &quot;agricultural and pastoral shows&quot; (A&amp;P shows).

==Agricultural shows and swine influenza==

=== Background ===
Agricultural shows can be sources of swine influenza transmission in both animal and human populations. Swine influenza is a communicable disease caused by one of several different strains of influenza A virus. Currently, the subtypes of influenza A virus which have been identified in pig populations within the United States are referred to as H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2, all named for their specific genetic makeups. These viruses are extremely common in pigs across various industries, including pig showmanship at agricultural fairs, and are easily passed between pigs when proper hygiene and safety measures are not carried out.

It is rare for the virus to spread to humans; however, genetic reassortment can lead to susceptibility among humans. Due to direct contact with infected animals or a contaminated environment, swine influenza strains can be transmitted to human populations. In cases such as the 2009 flu pandemic, the virus was transmitted from swine to humans and caused a global pandemic which led to the deaths of approximately 12,000 people in the United States alone. For this reason, people who work or spend any time in close proximity with pigs are at risk for infection and must follow specific precautions to prevent the spread of swine influenza.

=== Swine influenza risk ===
Certain populations at agricultural fairs are at increased risk of developing serious complications after swine influenza exposure. For instance, pregnant women are more susceptible to swine influenza and have been shown to have increased rates of swine influenza relative to the general population. Similarly, adolescents, infants, and those with serious medical comorbid conditions have disproportionately high rates of mortality with swine influenza. This is concerning as over 3.5 million children in the United States participate in youth agricultural programs every year.

Agricultural fairs can readily lead to swine influenza infection in populations because agricultural fairs are frequently visited by entire families, including children and pregnant women.

=== Recent swine flu variant outbreaks in the United States ===

Swine influenza variant viruses have been responsible for several recent outbreaks in the United States associated with contact with pigs at agricultural fairs. The three main Influenza A viruses responsible for these outbreaks are variants of the Influenza A viruses H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.

Recent swine influenza variant outbreaks associated with agriculture fairs in the United States:
*2009: global spread of H1N1, starting from the United States in April 2009. On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organization issued an imminent pandemic alert. At this time, 70 countries reported ongoing outbreaks, and over 1 million ongoing cases were documented in the United States alone. H1N1 is now a regularly occurring human influenza virus that continues to circulate seasonally and globally with the other influenza viruses.
*2012: 306 confirmed cases identified of H3N2 in 10 different states. Over 80% of cases were found in Ohio and Indiana. Human-to-human transmission is thought to have caused 15 cases, but the rest all reported direct or indirect contact with swine, mostly at agricultural fairs. (See image) 
*2016: 18 confirmed cases in Ohio and Michigan between July and August 2016. All cases reported pig exposure at least one of seven agricultural fairs between the two states.
*2017: 40 confirmed cases of H3N2 occurred in Maryland after swine exposure at one of three agricultural fairs. 35 of the cases occurred in people in the high-risk category for influenza complications.

=== Preventing the spread of flu in people and pigs ===

In the United States, agricultural fairs are a significant exposure source for swine influenza. Certain strains of swine influenza can be transmitted from pig to pig, pig to human, and human to human; swine influenza infection does not always show signs of illness.

There are a variety of safety precautions that should be taken at agricultural fairs to prevent the spread of swine influenza. Vulnerable communities including children, people aged 65 years and older, pregnant women, and those suffering from long-term health conditions are groups who should avoid swine exposure due to their high-risk status. The CDC specifically recommends that high-risk individuals with known medical complications avoid interaction with swine at agricultural fairs. It is advised that anyone who develops flu symptoms after swine exposure at agricultural fairs contact their physician for appropriate medical consultation.

There are other recommended prevention strategies to reduce the spread of swine influenza at agricultural fairs. It is suggested that people do not bring food into pig areas, do not take any items such as toys, pacifiers or similar items near the pig areas, avoid close contact with any pigs, and wash hands before and after handling pigs. Given the severity of the disease, it is prudent to adopt safety precautions to limit the spread of the swine flu.
