<text>Sail components include the features that define a sail&#x27;s shape and function, plus its constituent parts from which it is manufactured. A sail may be classified in a variety of ways, including by its orientation to the vessel (e.g. &quot;fore-and-aft&quot;) and its shape, (e.g. &quot;(a)symmetrical&quot;, &quot;triangular&quot;, &quot;quadrilateral&quot;, etc.). Sails are typically constructed out of flexible material that is shaped by various means, while in use, to offer an appropriate airfoil, according to the strength and apparent direction of the wind. A variety of features and fittings allow the sail to be attached to lines and spars.

Whereas conventional sails form an airfoil with one layer of fabric, wingsails comprise a structure that has material on both sides to form an airfoil—much like a wing placed vertically on the vessel—and are beyond the scope of this article.

==Classifications==

Sails may be classified as either &quot;triangular&quot;, which describes sails that either come to one point of suspension at the top or where the sail comes to a point at the forward end, or &quot;quadrilateral&quot;, which includes sails that are attached to a spar at the top and have three other sides, or as &quot;square&quot;. They also may be classified as &quot;symmetrical&quot; (square sails and symmetric spinnakers) or &quot;asymmetrical&quot; (most other sails). Typically, asymmetrical sails perform better on points of sail closer to the wind than symmetrical sails and are designed for &quot;fore-and-aft&quot; rigs. Symmetrical sails perform best on points of sail that are further from the wind direction.

===Triangular===

Triangular sails have names for each of three edges and three corners, explained below. Rigs with such sails include Bermuda, cutter, lateen and vessels with mixed sail plans that include jibs and other staysails. Most triangular sails are classified as &quot;asymmetrical&quot; and &quot;fore and aft&quot;; symmetric spinnakers are &quot;symmetrical&quot; triangular sails that are designed for off-the-wind use.

===Quadrilateral===

Gaff, gunter, lug, junk and some sprit sails have four sides and are set &quot;fore and aft&quot; so that one edge is leading into the wind, forming an &quot;asymmetric&quot; quadrilateral shape. Naming conventions are consistent with triangular sails, except for the top edge and corners, as explained below.

=== Square ===
A &quot;square rig&quot; is a type of sail and rigging arrangement in which the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal spars which are perpendicular, or , to the keel of the vessel and to the masts—the sails themselves are not square but are &quot;symmetrically&quot; quadrilateral. These spars are called &quot;yards&quot; and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the &quot;yardarms&quot;. A ship mainly so rigged is called a &quot;square-rigger&quot;.

==Shape==
The shape of a sail is defined by its edges and corners in the plane of the sail, laid out on a flat surface. The edges may be curved, either to extend the sail&#x27;s shape as an airfoil or to define its shape in use. In use, the sail becomes a curved shape, adding the dimension of depth or &quot;draft&quot;.

===Edges===
The top of all sails is called the &quot;head&quot;, the leading edge is called the &quot;luff&quot;, the trailing edge is the &quot;leech&quot;, and the bottom edge is the &quot;foot&quot;.

*&quot;Head&quot; – The &quot;head&quot; is the upper edge of the sail, and is attached at the throat and peak to a gaff, yard, or sprit. For a triangular sail the &quot;head&quot; refers to the topmost corner.
*&quot;Leech&quot; – The aft (back) edge of a fore-and-aft sail is called the &quot;leech&quot; (also spelled &quot;leach&quot;). The &quot;leech&quot; is either side edge of a symmetrical sail—triangular or square. However, once a symmetrical sail has wind blowing along its surface, whether on a reach or close-hauled, the windward leech may be called a &quot;luff&quot; (see below).
*&quot;Luff&quot; – The forward (leading) edge of a fore-and-aft sail is called the &quot;luff&quot;, and may be attached along a mast or a stay. When on a reach, the windward leech of a spinnaker (symmetrical or not) is called the luff and, when on a reach or close-hauled, the windward leech of a square sail may be called the luff or the &quot;weather leech&quot;.
*&quot;Foot&quot; – The &quot;foot&quot; of a sail is its bottom edge. On a fore-and-aft mainsail, the foot is often attached, at the tack and clew, to a boom; on a square sail to a spar by clews on both ends; if no boom or spar is present, the sail is said to be &quot;loose-footed&quot;.

====Roach====
A fore-and-aft triangular mainsail achieves a better approximation of a wing form by extending the leech aft, beyond the line between the head and clew in an arc called the &quot;roach&quot;, rather than having a triangular shape. This added area would flutter in the wind and not contribute to the efficient airfoil shape of the sail without the presence of battens. Offshore cruising mainsails sometimes have a &quot;hollow leech&quot; (the inverse of a roach) to obviate the need for battens and their ensuing likelihood of chafing the sail.

&quot;Roach&quot; is a term also applied to square sail design—it is the arc of a circle above a straight line from clew to clew at the foot of a square sail, from which sail material is omitted. The greater the departure from the straight line, the greater the &quot;hollow&quot; in the roach. The roach allows the foot of the sail to clear stays coming up the mast, as the sails are rotated from side to side.

===Corners===

The names of corners of sails vary, depending on shape and symmetry.

*&quot;Head&quot; – In a triangular sail, the corner where the luff and the leech connect is called the &quot;head&quot;. On a square sail, the top corners are &quot;head cringles&quot;, where there are grommets, called cringles.

*&quot;Peak &quot; – On a quadrilateral sail, the &quot;peak&quot; is the upper aft corner of the sail, at the top end of a gaff, a sprit or other spar. 
*&quot;Throat&quot; – On a quadrilateral sail, the &quot;throat&quot; is the upper forward corner of the sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two &quot;halyards&quot; to raise the sails: the &quot;throat halyard&quot; raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the &quot;peak halyard&quot; raises the aft, peak end.
*&quot;Clew&quot; – The corner where the leech and foot connect is called the &quot;clew&quot; on a fore-and-aft sail. On a jib, the sheet is connected to the clew; on a mainsail, the sheet is connected to the boom (if present) near the clew. &quot;Clews&quot; are the lower two corners of a square sail. Square sails have &quot;sheets&quot; attached to their clews like triangular sails, but the sheets are used to pull the sail down to the yard below rather than to adjust the angle it makes with the wind. The corner where the leech and the foot connect is called the &quot;clew&quot;. In the case of a symmetrical spinnaker, each of the lower corners of the sail is a clew. However, under sail on a given tack, the corner to which the spinnaker sheet is attached is called the &quot;clew&quot;, and the corner attached to the spinnaker pole is referred to as the &quot;tack&quot;. 
*&quot;Tack&quot; – The tack is the corner on a fore-and-aft sail where the luff and foot connect and, on a mainsail, is located where the boom and mast connect. On a square sail underway, the tack is the windward clew and also the line holding down that corner.

===Draft===

Those triangular sails that are attached to both a mast along the luff and a boom along the foot have depth, known as &quot;draft or draught&quot;, which results from the luff and foot being curved, rather than straight as they are attached to those spars. Draft creates a more efficient airfoil shape for the sail. Draft can also be induced in triangular staysails by adjustment of the sheets and the angle from which they reach the sails.

==Construction==
Sails are constructed of fabrics that may be woven or manufactured as films. The sail are often assembled of multiple panels that are arrayed in a manner that transfers the load from the wind to the sail&#x27;s attachment points—a combination of corners and edges—that transmits the load into the mast and powers the boat. Construction of such sails requires stitching, bonding, reinforcements and other features to achieve this. Other sails are constructed directly from fibers, filaments and films.

===Materials===

The characteristics of a sail are due to design, construction and the attributes of the fibers, which are woven together to make the sail cloth. There are several key factors in evaluating a fiber for suitability in weaving a sail-cloth:
*&quot;Initial modulus&quot; – The ability to resist stretching. Higher resistance is better for upwind sails.
*&quot;Breaking strength (tenacity)&quot; – Measured as a force per cross sectional area of fiber. Higher is better for sails.
*&quot;Creep&quot; – Describes the long term stretch of a fiber or fabric. A material with creep may have a superior modulus, but lose its shape over time.
*&quot;Resistance to ultraviolet light&quot; – Strength loss from exposure to the Sun’s UV rays measured by a standardized exposure test.
*&quot;Flex strength&quot; – Strength lost due to bending, folding, or flogging, which is frequently measured with an industry standard 50 fold test.
*&quot;Cost-effectiveness&quot; – Both the initial cost and its durability of the material define its cost-effectiveness over time.
Traditionally, sails were made from flax or cotton canvas. Materials used in sails, as of the 21st Century, include nylon for spinnakers—where light weight and elastic resistance to shock load are valued—and a range of fibers, used for triangular sails, that includes Dacron, aramid fibers—including Kevlar, and other liquid crystal polymer fibers—including Vectran.

Woven materials, like Dacron, may be specified as either high or low &quot;tenacity&quot;, as indicated, in part by their denier count (a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers). High-tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 220, 350 and 570 deniers, whereas low-tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 150, 250, and 400 deniers. Sailcloth is typically heat-shrunk to tighten the weave and then receives a chemical bonding finish of melamine. Such cloth is typically specified by deniers for warp and fill (weft), e.g. 220/570.

===Panels and laminations===

Conventional sails comprise panels, which are most often stitched together, at other times adhered. There are two basic configurations, &quot;cross-cut&quot; and &quot;radial&quot;. &quot;Cross-cut&quot; sails have the panels sewn parallel to one another, often parallel to the foot of the sail, and are the less expensive of the two sail constructions. Triangular cross-cut sail panels are designed to meet the mast and stay at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the bias) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail.

&quot;Radial&quot; sails have panels that &quot;radiate&quot; from corners in order to efficiently transmit stress and are typically higher-performance than cross-cut sails. A &quot;bi-radial&quot; sail has panels radiating from two of three corners; a &quot;tri-radial&quot; sail has panels radiating from all three corners. Mainsails are more likely to be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) are more likely to be tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners.

Higher-performance sails may be laminated, constructed directly from multiple plies of filaments, fibers, taffetas, and films—instead of woven textiles—and adhered together. &quot;Molded sails&quot; are laminated sails formed over a curved mold and adhered together into a shape that does not lie flat.

Where a sail may rub against a spreader on the mast, a spreader patch may be placed on a jib, when it overlaps with the mast, or on the mainsail, where it may interfere when furled or when the sail is backwinded against the mast.
===Stitching and bonding===
Conventional sail panels are sewn together. Sails are tensile structures, so the role of a seam is to transmit a tensile load from panel to panel. For a sewn, textile sail this is done through thread and is limited by the strength of the thread and the strength of the hole in the textile through which it passes. Sail seams are often overlapped between panels and sewn with zig-zag stitches that create many connections per unit of seam length. Measures for seam structural attributes—shown with a typical value for a sewn seam—include:
*&quot;Breaking force&quot; (newtons) – 
*&quot;Elongation&quot; (percent) – 22%
*&quot;Strength&quot; (newtons/millimetre) – 
*&quot;Modulus of elasticity&quot; (newtons/millimetre) – 
Whereas textiles are typically sewn together, other sail materials may be ultrasonically welded—a technique whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld. It is commonly used for plastics, and especially for joining dissimilar materials.

===Edge construction===
Sails have a variety of treatments at their edges, either to attach the sail to a stay, spar or mast or to prevent a free edge from fluttering or fraying.
*&quot;Bolt ropes&quot; are sewn onto the edges of the sail to reinforce them, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller-furling jib.
*&quot;Leech lines&quot; are found on mainsails and large jibs to tighten the leech and prevent fluttering. They run through a sleeve on the leech from the head to the clew, where there is usually a clam cleat to tighten it. Occasionally, &quot;foot lines&quot; perform an analogous function on a loose-footed sail.
*&quot;UV protection panels&quot; are usually affixed to the leech and foot of roller furling jibs to prevent ultraviolet rays from reaching the sailcloth while the sail is not in use. These are typically a dark color to absorb the harmful rays.

===Reinforcements at attachment points===

The corners of triangular sails are typically areas of high stress and consequently often have reinforced layers and tape radiating from, whether cross-cut or radial in construction. Their corners are always attached to a shackle, attached to a line or spar—the halyard at the head, a shackle at the tack, and the outhaul at the clew. The connecting shackle runs through a grommet at each of these points. There are additional points where reinforcing and grommets may occur: at the cunningham, a downhaul used to flatten a mainsail (jibs may have a similar feature), and along the foot of a Genoa jib to allow a line to lift it out of the waves. The head of a triangular sail may have a rigid &quot;headboard&quot; riveted to it in order to transfer load from the sail to the halyard.

Square sails and gaff-rigged sails also have grommets at corners. Only the clews on a square sail take a comparatively large amount of stress, because the head is supported along the spar. Three sides of gaff-rigged sails are attached to a mast or spar.

===Battens===


A &quot;sail batten&quot; is a flexible insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail&#x27;s airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail battens is in the roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have full-length battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section.

Junk rigs feature full-length battens that facilitate short-handed sail handling, including reefing. The battens are attached loosely to the mast with lines called &quot;batten parrels&quot; that allow fore-and-aft motion as the sail is controlled by individual sheets leading to multiple battens.

==Fittings==

Sails usually have fittings attached to them that transmit force through a small area. These include grommets, which reinforce fabric at an attachment points and connections to lines; hoops and slides, which attach sails to spars; and reefing features, which may include reefing lines attached to the sail or grommets that have reefing lines running through them. Additional features include tell-tales, windows—used on dinghy sails—and lettering and other graphics that include sail numbers and manufacturers logos, etc.

===Hardware===
Where sails are attached to a mast, spar, or stay there is some kind of connection—often it&#x27;s the bolt rope running through a groove in the mast, boom, or head foil—otherwise, there is a piece of hardware involved, e.g.:
*&quot;Gaff sails&quot; usually have hoops that slide up and down the mast.
*&quot;Bermuda mainsails&quot; may have slides attached to the luff that match tracks on the mast and boom. These may be attached to the luff through grommets with webbing or a nylon shackle or with webbing sewn directly on the sail.
*&quot;Jibs&quot; that are not roller-furling usually have &quot;hanks&quot;, clips that attach to the stay. This applies to other &quot;staysails&quot;, as well.
Other hardware includes &quot;cam cleats&quot;, used to tension luff and foot lines.

===Reefing points===
Different categories of sails are reefed (reduced in size) in different manners and therefore have different fixtures that achieve shortening of sail. Traditional canvas square and gaff-rigged sails have one or more rows of &quot;reefing lines&quot; that pass through the sail, which reach around the sail that has been gathered in to reduce its size and secure the remaining unreefed sail to the spar (square rig) or boom (gaff rig). Gaff-rigged sails require an extra set of lines to secure the part of the leech that becomes the new clew. These are called &quot;reef pendents&quot; that drop through a &quot;comb&quot; on the boom, where they are secured, as needed.

Mainsails on Bermuda rigs typically have paired grommets that secure the luff and leech to the boom, as the sail is lowered to reduce its area. These become the new tack and clew. A reefing line typically runs through the reef point on the luff to quickly secure the new clew. The grommet that becomes the new tack is typically hooked onto the boom. There may be grommets along the line between the new tack and clew that allow ties to pass through around the boom.

===Tell-tales===

Tell-tales are pieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails to help visualize airflow over their surfaces. Typically, they are mounted near the luff of sails, but they are also found on the leach on some sails. To windward, a sagging tell-tale indicates still air, either from stalling (indicated on the leeward side, when the sail is sheeted in too far, compared to the apparent wind) or pinching (indicated on the windward side, when the sail isn&#x27;t sheeted in far enough, compared to the apparent wind).

<doc id="1137762" wikidata="Q959809" url="?curid=1137762" title="Pete Kircher">
<text>Peter Derek Kircher (born 21 January 1945, Folkestone, Kent) is a retired English rock/pop drummer. He was the drummer for Honeybus (1967–1970), Liverpool Express (1978–1979) and Original Mirrors (1979–1981). Between 1981 and 1985 he was a member of Status Quo, performing with the band at Live Aid and on the albums &quot;Back to Back&quot; and &quot;Live at the N.E.C.&quot;.

After Kircher left Status Quo in 1985, he retired from the music business and, with the exception of a 2003 Honeybus reunion, has completely stepped from the spotlight. He was last known to have been working as a sign writer.

==Career==
In the early 1960s, Kircher toured Germany doing club gigs as the drummer for The Burnettes, a band featuring Neil Landon as singer and Noel Redding playing guitar. His earliest documented recordings are with Redding, who later played bass with Jimi Hendrix.

=== Honeybus ===
More session work followed, before Kircher was recruited in April 1967 to join Honeybus, who although often written off as a one-hit wonder with their track “I Can’t Let Maggie Go” in 1968, produced a sizeable body of baroque pop music which culminated in a critically acclaimed 1970 album, &quot;Story&quot;, which was released after the eventual dissolution of the band.

Less commercially successful work with Honeybus survives in the form of two albums, &quot;March Hare&quot; (credited to Colin Hare, the rhythm guitarist with Honeybus) and &quot;Into Your Ears&quot;, a solo album by Pete Dello, which were both released in 1971. Comparisons with Honeybus were inevitably drawn; the sessions bled into each other causing a reunion in all but name, and record company executives were impressed by this new work that they commissioned an album, &quot;Recital&quot;, to be released under the Honeybus name. Only test pressings of this exist, as a change in management at the label aborted the planned release.

=== Liverpool Express and Status Quo ===
In 1978, Peter joined Liverpool Express as their drummer and contributing to their third album &quot;L.E.X.&quot;, Kircher was invited in 1979 to join Original Mirrors, a new wave band featuring Ian Broudie (later of the bands Care and Lightning Seeds) on guitar. His time in this band took him up to 1981, taking in a session playing drums on the Nolan Sisters single &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Rock You&quot;, before being invited to join Status Quo following the resignation of John Coghlan. Kircher&#x27;s membership was announced in a press conference in January 1982. Kircher played drums for Status Quo at their performance at Live Aid in 1985.

Not long after Status Quo&#x27;s performance at Live Aid, Kircher left the group and retired from the music industry.

=== Other works ===
After Honeybus ended in 1973, Kircher was then a member of the band Shanghai, where he joined Mick Green from Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The band produced two albums, released in 1974 and 1976, when the band supported Status Quo on the &quot;Blue for You&quot; tour. This, in turn, directly led to Kircher&#x27;s induction into a group of session musicians for John Du Cann&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Not Big Enough&quot; album in 1977, which was produced by Quo&#x27;s guitarist Francis Rossi. Kircher played drums on tracks 1-15 and 26.

Kircher often worked as a session drummer, most notably playing drums on &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot; by Maxine Nightingale. Kircher&#x27;s style is rhythmic, and much of his work uses a low-tuned snare drum sound. As well as drums, Kircher contributed backing vocals to the bands he played with, and test pressings of a 1973 solo single – &quot;Rockin&#x27; Lady&quot; – are known to exist.

One of Kircher&#x27;s last works as a professional musicians before retiring was recording some tracks with Rossi and Bernard Frost for their unreleased solo album &quot;Flying Debris&quot; in 1985

== Personal life ==
Little has been heard from Kircher since, although Honeybus were briefly reunited for a Dutch TV show in 2003. Kircher stated during an interview in this programme that he is now working as a signwriter, a profession he first started as a school leaver.

<doc id="1137766" wikidata="Q504033" url="?curid=1137766" title="Oral and maxillofacial surgery">
<text>Oral and maxillofacial surgery is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the mouth, head and neck, and jaws, as well as facial plastic surgery including cleft lip and cleft palate surgery.

== Specialty ==
An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a specialist surgeon who treats the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, and skull, head and neck as well as associated structures. Depending upon the national jurisdiction, oral and maxillofacial surgery may require a degree in medicine, dentistry or both.

=== Subspecialties ===
In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether possessing a single or dual degree, may further specialize after residency, undergoing additional one or two year sub-specialty oral and maxillofacial surgery fellowship training in the following areas:

*Cosmetic facial surgery, including eyelid (blepharoplasty), nose (rhinoplasty), facial lift, brow lift, and laser resurfacing
* Cranio-maxillofacial trauma, including zygomatic (cheek bone), orbital (eye socket), mandibular and nasal fractures as well as facial soft tissue lacerations and penetrating neck injuries
*Craniofacial surgery/pediatric maxillofacial surgery, including cleft lip and palate surgery and trans-cranial craniofacial surgery including Fronto-Orbital Advancement and Remodelling (FOAR) and total vault remodelling
*Head and neck cancer and microvascular reconstruction free flap surgery
* Maxillofacial regeneration, which is re-formation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique

===United Kingdom and Europe===
In countries such as the UK and most of Europe, it is recognised as a specialty of medicine with a degree in medicine and an additional degree in dentistry being compulsory. The scope of practice is mainly head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma, skin cancer, facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial surgery, TMJ surgery and cosmetic facial surgery.

In the UK, Maxillofacial surgery is a specialty of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Intercollegiate Board Certification is provided through the JCIE, and is the same as Plastic Surgery, ENT, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Paediatric Surgery, Neurosurgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery.

The FRCS (Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons) is the specialist exam at the end of surgical training, and is required to work as a Consultant Surgeon in Maxillofacial Surgery.

In the EU, OMFS is defined within Directive 2005/36 on professional qualifications (updated 2021). The two OMFS specialties are &#x27;dual degree&#x27; dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery (DOMFS) and &#x27;single medical degree&#x27; maxillofacial surgery (MFS). In some cases a dental degree may be required to enter specialty training but in all cases the medical degree must be obtained before starting OMFS specialty training. 

In Poland, Maxillofacial Surgery has always been dominated by dentists and still the majority of current OMFS trainees are dental graduates.

Since 2019, Norway switched from dual degree requirement for Maxillofacial Surgery to medical degree only. Similarly, Sweden has started several Maxillofacial Surgery training programs for medical graduates.
=== Canada and Asia ===
In Asia, oral and maxillofacial surgery is also recognized as a dental specialty and requires a degree in dentistry prior to surgical residency training. The Canadian model is the same as the model used in the United States of America.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, OMFS is recognized as specialty of dentistry which requires FCPS from CPSP after 4 years BDS degree and a one-year housejob. The candidate has to pass FCPS-1 in order to commence his/her training followed by PGMI Exam(not in all cases).

===India===
Oral and maxillofacial surgery, also known as OMFS, is a branch recognized by DCI (Dental Council of India) in countries such as India. In India, becoming a maxillofacial surgeon requires a five-year dental degree followed by three years of post-graduate specialisation. In India, oral and maxillofacial surgery includes the treatment of complex dental surgery, including wisdom tooth removal, dental implant, craniomaxillofacial trauma, Orofacial pain (trigeminal neuralgia) and jaw joint pain (Temporomandibular disorder(TMD) or TMJ Pain) management, jaw joint(TMJ) replacement for TMJ ankylosis and deformed jaw joint cases, Lefort-3 distraction for Craniosynostosis case, jaw tumor and cyst removal surgery, head and neck cancer, facial aesthetic like rhinoplasty, eye and ear plastic surgery, Facial cosmetic surgery, microvascular surgery, and cleft and craniomaxillofacial surgery. In India, a Maxillofacial surgeon is considered one of the required members of the emergency team. Almost 20-25% of trauma patients usually have sustained facial trauma, and that needs urgent opinion and primary management that can be better managed by Maxillofacial experts.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia and New Zealand, oral and maxillofacial surgery is recognised as both a specialty of medicine and dentistry. Degrees in both medicine and dentistry are compulsory prior to being accepted for surgical training. The scope of practice is broad and there is the ability to undertake subspecialty fellowships in areas such as head and neck surgery and microvascular reconstruction.

===Globally===
In other countries, oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty exists but under different forms, as the work is sometimes performed by a single or dual qualified specialist depending on each country&#x27;s regulations and training opportunities available. In several countries, oral and maxillofacial surgery is a specialty recognized by a professional association, as is the case with the Dental Council of India, American Dental Association, Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Brazilian Federal Council of Odontology (CFO).

== Regulation ==
Oral and maxillofacial surgery is an internationally recognized surgical specialty. Oral and maxillofacial surgery is formally designated as either a medical, dental or dual (medical and dental) specialty.

=== United States of America===
In the United States, oral and maxillofacial surgery is a recognized surgical specialty, formally designated as a dental specialty. A professional dental degree is required, a qualification in medicine may be undertaken optionally during residency training. In this respect, oral and maxillofacial surgery is &quot;sui generis&quot; among surgical specialties. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires an extensive 4-6 year surgical residency training covering the U.S. specialty&#x27;s scope of practice: surgery of the oral cavity, dental implant surgery, dentoalveolar surgery, surgery of the temporomandibular joint, general surgery, reconstructive surgery of the face, head and neck, mouth, and jaws, facial cosmetic surgery, facial deformity, craniofacial surgery, facial skin cancer, head and neck cancer, microsurgery free flap reconstruction, facial trauma, facial trauma surgery and, uniquely, the administration of general anesthesia and deep sedation. As is the norm among surgical specialists, oral and maxillofacial surgery residents typically serve as Chief Resident in their final year.

Following residency training, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether single or dual degree, have the option of undergoing 1-2 year surgical sub-specialty fellowship for further training in head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, cosmetic facial surgery, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma.

==== Board certification ====
Board certification in the U.S. is governed by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (ABOMS). Oral and maxillofacial surgery is among the fourteen surgical specialties recognized by the American College of Surgeons. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the United States, whether single or dual degree, may become Fellows of the American College of Surgeons, &quot;FACS&quot; (Fellow, American College of Surgeons).

==== Professional organizations ====
The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) is the chief professional organization representing the roughly 9,000 oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the United States. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons publishes the peer-reviewed Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.

==== Anesthesia ====
In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons are required to undergo five months of intensive general anesthesia training. An additional month of pediatric anesthesia training is also required. The American Society of Anesthesiologists published a &quot;Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team&quot; which specifies qualified anesthesia personnel and practitioners as anesthesiologists, anesthesiology fellows, anesthesiology residents, and oral and maxillofacial surgery residents.

Unique among surgical specialists in the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons are trained to administer general anesthesia and deep sedation, and they are licensed to do so in both hospital and office settings.

In the specialty&#x27;s infancy, dental and oral surgeons were plenary in the introduction of anesthesia to modern medicine and the development of modern surgery. In 1844, at Harvard Medical School&#x27;s Massachusetts General Hospital, dentist, Dr. Horace Wells was the first to use anesthesia, but with limited success. On 16 October 1846, Boston oral surgeon, Dr. William Thomas Green Morton gave a successful demonstration using diethyl ether to Harvard medical students at the same venue. In one of the most important and well documented events in American medical history, Morton was invited to Massachusetts General Hospital to demonstrate his technique for painless surgery. After Morton had induced anesthesia, Dr. John Collins Warren, a founding member of Massachusetts General Hospital, the hospital&#x27;s first surgeon, and the first Dean of Harvard Medical School, removed a tumor from the neck of patient, Edward Gilbert Abbott. The demonstration was performed in the surgical amphitheater now called the Ether Dome at Harvard. Massachusetts General Hospital views the demonstration as among the institution&#x27;s most significant claims to fame. Upon the successful completion of Dr. Morton&#x27;s demonstration, Dr. Warren famously proclaimed to the crowded, astonished and elated amphitheater, what would become likely the most famous words in modern medicine, &quot;Gentlemen, this is no humbug.&quot; Indeed, the event marked the beginning of modern anesthesia and surgical practice.

Immediately following the demonstration, in a congratulatory letter to Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, polymath and later Harvard Medical School Dean, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., father of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. of the Supreme Court of the United States, proposed naming the state produced &quot;anesthesia&quot;, and the procedure an &quot;anesthetic.&quot; Holmes wrote to Morton, &quot;Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names—or the name—to be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called &#x27;Anaesthesia.&#x27; This signifies insensibility—more particularly ... to objects of touch.&quot; Holmes added poetically that the new term &quot;will be repeated by the &quot;tongues&quot; of every civilized [member] of mankind.&quot;

Dr. Ferdinand Hasbrouck, a New York oral surgeon and an 1870 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine was among the first practitioners to succeed in the regular and commercial use of anesthesia in private surgical practice. In 1893, U.S. President Grover Cleveland was diagnosed with an intraoral tumor. The President chose Dr. Hasbrouck to serve among his team of surgeons and simultaneously as &quot;the&quot; anesthesiologist for the procedure. For political reasons, Cleveland did not want the public to know about his condition. The operation was performed in secret on the yacht &quot;Oneida&quot; in the Long Island Sound, NY. Dr. Hasbrouck, induced President Cleveland with nitrous oxide and extracted teeth from the corpus of the tumor. As Cleveland recovered from nitrous oxide, Dr. Hasbrouck began the administration of ether for the remainder of the procedure as he and the team performed the tumor surgery. The procedure was a milestone for the practice of anesthesia. Ferdinand Hasbrouck&#x27;s son, James F. Hasbrouck, discussed below, was among the founders of the Columbia University College of Dental and Oral Surgeons in 1916.

In 1945, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Niels Jorgensen was first to develop intravenous moderate sedation. His technique, administering pentobarbital, meperidine and scopolamine intravenously, was widely accepted and first taught at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, beginning in 1945.

In the United States, a close educational and professional relationship between oral and maxillofacial surgery and anesthesiology persists to the present day.

==== Craniofacial surgery ====
Oral and maxillofacial surgery stands as a pillar of the modern practice of plastic surgery and plastic surgery&#x27;s recognition in 1941 as a surgical specialty in the United States. In the early 1900s, plastic surgery was founded by a professional organization of oral surgeons with elite training and an interest in plastic and reconstructive surgery, the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgery. Over time, the exclusive organization began to elect a small number of non-oral surgeon members, the first of which was legendary general surgeon Dr. Vilray Blair of Washington University in St. Louis. The organization became the American Association of Plastic Surgeons in 1921. At Harvard University, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Kazanjian pioneered plastic surgery and is considered to be a founder, if not, &quot;the&quot; founder of the modern practice of plastic surgery. He graduated from Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1905. Dr. Kazanjian was Professor of Clinical Oral Surgery at Harvard from 1922 to 1941 when he was named Harvard&#x27;s first Professor of Plastic Surgery. Dr. Kazanjian was instrumental in plastic surgery&#x27;s formal recognition as an independent surgical specialty in 1941. Dr. Kazanjian joined the First Harvard Unit, serving with the British Forces in WWI, establishing the first dental and maxillofacial clinic in France, handling more than 3,000 cases of severe wounds to the face and jaws. He was honored for his surgical advances by British monarch George V, who invested him Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George. Kazanjian served as an early president of American Association of Plastic Surgeons.

Another founder and god-father of plastic surgery was University of Pennsylvania oral surgeon, Dr. Robert H. Ivy, an 1898 University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine graduate, developed the surgical treatment of cleft lip and cleft palate. The inter-maxillary fixation technique, the &quot;Ivy Loop&quot; is named after him. Ivy is considered a pioneer and father of the modern practice of plastic surgery. Ivy was influenced by Dr. Vilray Blair of Washington University School of Medicine. Ivy founded the &quot;Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&quot;, plastic surgery&#x27;s premier peer-reviewed academic journal and the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgeons and served as its president. In 1919, New York City oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Armin Wald, an 1896 graduate of New York University College of Dentistry, was among the first in the United States to successfully demonstrate and publish a procedure for alveolectomy and alveoloplasty, the surgical resection and smoothing of the ridge of the mandible and maxilla for cosmetic and prosthetic purposes. Once mastered, the innovative procedure was remarkably simple; to the present, the procedure is commonplace among oral, plastic and ENT surgeons performing alveolar ridge reconstruction and bone grafting. Wald was influenced by his father, Henry Wald, M.D., an 1872 University of Vienna Faculty of Medicine graduate and preceptor in surgery at Columbia College School of Medicine; their nephew, Charles A. Reich, became a law professor at Yale. Wald&#x27;s partner, New York University oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. James F. Hasbrouck, interested in the development of the surgical specialty in New York, was among the founders of the Columbia University College of Dental and Oral Surgery in 1916. In keeping with the ideals of the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgeons, the first two years of coursework at the new college were fully unified with Columbia&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, of which Hasbrouck was an 1894 graduate. Students devoted their entire second two years to specialization in surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, which provided extraordinary preparation for the possibility of post-graduate residency training in oral surgery. Hasbrouck was notable in the specialty for having received both a dental and medical degree prior to 1895. His father, oral surgeon, Ferdinand Hasbrouck, discussed above, was a pioneer in anesthesiology. Hasbrouck&#x27;s and Wald&#x27;s sons, Theodore F. Hasbrouck and Arthur H. Wald both graduated from Columbia&#x27;s College of Dental and Oral Surgery in 1937. Arthur Wald made further advances in grafting in oral, plastic and reconstructive surgery with the early use of fibrin foam and thrombin in the resection of large and rare mandibular tumors. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and owned a cosmetic practice in midtown Manhattan. Globally, the role of oral and maxillofacial surgery was also profound in the founding of plastic surgery: outside the United States, fathers of plastic surgery include London based otolaryngologist Sir Harold Gillies and his French mentor, the oral and maxillofacial surgeon Dr. Hippolyte Morestin.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery&#x27;s stature and clout in university hospitals can be traced to its plenary role in the development of modern medicine and surgery.

==== State licensure ====
While a professional dental degree, &quot;i.e.&quot;, D.D.S. or D.M.D. is mandatory in the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons may possess various doctoral degree combinations, &quot;e.g.&quot;, D.D.S., D.M.D., D.D.S./M.D., D.M.D./M.D., D.M.D./Ph.D. or D.D.S./Ph.D. Still, it is the completion of an oral and maxillofacial residency training program and corresponding certificate of specialty training that confers surgical specialty status and board eligibility, not the surgeon&#x27;s professional degree or degree combination. Analogously, it is a certificate of specialty training and board eligibility that satisfies state licensure requirements to administer general anesthesia and deep sedation, not the surgeon&#x27;s professional degree or degree combination.

D.D.S. (Doctor of Dental Surgery) and D.M.D. (Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry or Doctor of Dental Medicine) are the same degrees. D.M.D. and D.D.S. represent the same education. The letters used are a function of university discretion, both degrees represent an identical curriculum, set of educational requirements and level of educational attainment.

==== Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act taxonomy ====
Oral and maxillofacial surgery is assigned Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code: 204E00000X 

== Surgical procedures ==
In the United States and globally, treatments may be performed on the craniomaxillofacial complex: mouth, jaws, face, neck, and skull, and include:

* Cosmetic surgery of the head and neck: (rhytidectomy/facelift, browlift, blepharoplasty/Asian blepharoplasty, otoplasty, rhinoplasty, septoplasty, cheek augmentation, chin augmentation, genioplasty, oculoplastics, neck liposuction, hair transplantation, lip enhancement, injectable cosmetic treatments like botox, fillers, platelet rich plasma, stem cells, chemical peel, mesotherapy.
* Orthognathic surgery, surgical treatment/correction of dentofacial deformity as well as management of facial trauma, and sleep apnea
* Oncology head and neck surgery with free flap microvascular reconstruction
* Cutanous malignancy/skin cancer surgery of head and neck surgery skin grafts and local flaps
* Diagnosis and treatment of:
* benign pathology (cysts, tumors etc.)
* malignant pathology (oral &amp; head and neck cancer) with (ablative and reconstructive surgery, microsurgery)
* cutaneous malignancy (skin cancer), lip reconstruction
* congenital craniofacial malformations such as cleft lip and palate and cranial vault malformations such as craniosynostosis, (craniofacial surgery)
* chronic facial pain disorders
* temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders
* Orthognathic (literally &quot;straight jaw&quot;) reconstructive surgery, orthognathic surgery, maxillomandibular advancement, surgical correction of facial asymmetry.
* soft and hard tissue trauma of the oral and maxillofacial region (jaw fractures, cheek bone fractures, nasal fractures, LeFort fracture, skull fractures and eye socket fractures).
* Dentoalveolar surgery (surgery to remove impacted teeth, difficult tooth extractions, extractions on medically compromised patients, bone grafting or preprosthetic surgery to provide better anatomy for the placement of implants, dentures, or other dental prostheses)
* Surgery to insert osseointegrated (bone fused) dental implants and maxillofacial implants for attaching craniofacial prostheses and bone anchored hearing aids.

== Occupation ==
Oral and maxillofacial surgery is intellectually and physically demanding and is among the most highly compensated surgical specialties in the United States with a 2008 average annual income of $568,968.

The popularity of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a career for persons whose first degree was medicine, not dentistry, seems to be increasing. At least one program (University of Alabama at Birmingham) exists that allows highly qualified candidates whose first degree is in medicine, to earn the required dental degree, so as to qualify for entrance into oral and maxillofacial residency training programs and ultimately achieve board eligibility and certification in the surgical specialty.

== Education and training==
In the UK, Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the ten medical specialties, requiring MRCS and FRCS examinations.

In mainland Europe, its status, including whether or not oral surgery, maxillofacial surgery, and stomatology are considered separate specialties, varies by country. The required qualifications (medical degree, dental degree, or both, as well as the required internship and residency programs) also vary.

In the US, Australia and South Africa, Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the ten dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, and the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires four to six years of further formal university training after dental school (&quot;i.e.&quot;, DDS, BDent, DMD, or BDS).

Residency training programs are either four or six years in duration. In the United States, four-year residency programs grant a certificate of specialty training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Six-year programs granting an optional MD degree emerged in the early 1990s in the United States. Typically, Six-year residency programs grant the specialty certificate and an additional degree such as a medical degree (e.g., MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB) or research degree (e.g., MS, MSc, MPhil, MDS, MSD, MDSc, DClinDent, DSc, DMSc, PhD). Both four– and six–year graduates are designated US &quot;Board Eligible&quot; and those who earn &quot;Board Certification&quot; are Diplomats. Approximately 50% of the training programs in the US and 66% of Canadian training programs are &quot;dual-degree.&quot; The typical length of education and training, in post-secondary school is 12 to 14 years. Beyond these years, some sub-specialize, adding an additional 1-2 year fellowship.

The typical training program for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is:

* 2–4 years of undergraduate study (BS, BA, or equivalent degrees)
* 4 years dental study (DMD, BDent, DDS or BDS)
* 4–6 years residency trainingSome programs integrate an additional degree such as a master&#x27;s degree (MS, MDS, MSc, MClinDent, MScDent, MDent), doctoral degree (PhD, DMSc, DClinDent, DSc), or medical degree (e.g., MBBS, MD, DO, MBChB, MDCM)
* After completion of surgical training most undertake final specialty examinations: US: &quot;Board Certified (ABOMS)&quot;, Australia/NZ: FRACDS, or Canada: &quot;FRCDC&quot;
* Some colleges offer membership or fellowships in oral/maxillofacial surgery: MOralSurg RCS, M(OMS) RCPS, FFD RCSI, FEBOS, FACOMS, FFD RCS, FAMS, FCDSHK, FCMFOS (SA)
* Both single and dual qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeons may obtain fellowship with the American College of Surgeons (FACS).
* The International Board for the Certification of Specialists in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (IBCSOMS) was founded in May 2013 to define an international standard for specialists in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgeons may appear for international board certification examination after completion of surgical training.

===Surgical sub-specialty fellowship training===
In addition, single and dual-qualified graduates of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs can pursue post-residency sub-specialty fellowships, typically 1–2 years in length, in the following areas:

* Head and neck cancermicrovascular reconstruction
* Cosmetic facial surgery (facelift, rhinoplasty, etc.)
* Craniofacial surgery and pediatric maxillofacial surgery (cleft lip and palate repair, surgery for craniosynostosis, etc.)
* Cranio-maxillofacial trauma (soft tissue and skeletal injuries to the face, head and neck)

== Charities ==
Several notable philanthropic organizations provide humanitarian oral and maxillofacial surgery globally. Smile Train was created in 1998 by Charles Wang focusing on childhood facial deformity. Operation Smile focuses on correcting cleft lips and palates in children. AboutFace, created by Paul Stanley, of the rock band KISS, who was born with a facial deformity, focuses on craniofacial disfiguration.

<doc id="1137772" wikidata="Q1431958" url="?curid=1137772" title="State room">
<text>A state room or stateroom in a large European mansion is usually one of a suite of very grand rooms which were designed for use when entertaining royalty. The term was most widely used in the 17th and 18th centuries. They were the most lavishly decorated in the house and contained the finest works of art. State rooms were usually only found in the houses of the upper echelons of the aristocracy, those who were likely to entertain a head of state. They were generally to accommodate and entertain distinguished guests, especially a monarch and/or a royal , or other high-ranking aristocrats and state officials, hence the name. In their original form a set of state rooms made up a state apartment, which always included a bedroom.

== British Isles==
In Great Britain and Ireland in particular, state rooms in country houses were used occasionally, and only rarely all round the year. The occupier of the house and his family actually lived in other apartments in the house. And unlike the main reception rooms of later houses, state apartments were not freely open to all the guests in the house. Admittance to them was a privilege, and the further one penetrated (there were many variations, but an apartment might include for example an anteroom; withdrawing room; bedroom; dressing room; and closet) the greater the honour.

There was usually an odd number of state rooms. At the centre of the facade, the largest and most lavish room (for example at Wilton House the famous Double Cube Room, or as seen at Blenheim Palace), was a gathering place for the court of the important guest. Leading symmetrically from the grand centre room on either side were often one or two suites of smaller, but still very grand, state rooms, often in enfilade, for the sole use of the occupant of the final room at each end of the facade – the state bedroom.

== Changes from the early 18th century ==

From the early 18th century, as aristocratic lifestyles slowly became less formal, there was a move on the one hand to increase the number of shared living rooms in a large house and to give them more specialised functions (music rooms and billiard rooms for example) and on the other hand to make bedroom suites more private. In houses from earlier than around 1720 which survived without major structural alteration, the state rooms sometimes became a meaningless succession of drawing rooms and the original intention was lost. This is certainly true at Wilton House, Blenheim Palace, and Castle Howard. On the other hand, there were a few houses, and royal palaces, most of them exceptionally large, which were laid out in such a way that the state rooms could be left in their original form, while other rooms were converted to meet the new needs of the 18th and 19th centuries, or where funds were available to simply add on extra wings to meet the new requirements. Examples of such residences with surviving state suites which have never really changed their function include Chatsworth House and Boughton House.

The term &quot;state&quot; continued to be used in the names of individual rooms in some post 1720 houses (e.g. state dining room; state bedroom), but by then the original concept of a self-contained state apartment for an honoured personage was lost, and the term &quot;state&quot; can be taken more accurately to mean &quot;best&quot;.

== Nautical usage ==

On board a ship, the term &quot;state room&quot; defines a superior first-class cabin.

<text>Odd Thomas is a thriller novel by American writer Dean Koontz, published in 2003. The novel derives its title from the protagonist, a 20-year-old short-order cook named Odd Thomas. The book, well received and lauded by critics, went on to become a New York Times Bestseller. Following the success of the novel, six sequels, &quot;Forever Odd&quot; (2005), &quot;Brother Odd&quot; (2006), &quot;Odd Hours&quot; (2008), &quot;Odd Apocalypse&quot; (2012), and &quot;Deeply Odd&quot; (2013), were also written by Koontz. The final novel in the series &quot;Saint Odd&quot; (2015) was released on Jan 13, 2015. Three graphic-novel prequels, &quot;In Odd We Trust&quot;, &quot;Odd Is On Our Side&quot; and &quot;House of Odd&quot; have also been released. In the postscript to the graphic novel, Koontz states that &quot;God willing, there will be six Odd Thomas novels.&quot; A Special Odd Thomas Adventure (short novel), &quot;Odd Interlude&quot;, was released on December 26, 2012, and another &quot;Odd Thomas: You Are Destined to Be Together Forever&quot; on December 9, 2014.

==Plot summary==
In the beginning of the book, Odd Thomas is silently approached by the ghost of a young girl brutally raped and murdered, and through his unique ability to understand the dead, is psychically led to her killer, a former schoolmate named Harlo Landerson. Koontz discloses how Odd was named and begins, layer by layer, to show how Odd&#x27;s dysfunctional upbringing has shaped his life, and as those details are uncovered, his supernatural abilities begin to make more sense.

While working as a short order cook in a California desert town, Odd meets a suspicious-looking man in the diner followed by bodachs, shadowy spirit creatures who appear only during times of death and disaster. This man, who Odd nicknames &quot;Fungus Man&quot; (due to his waxy complexion and blond hair that resembles mold), has an unusually large swarm of bodachs following him, and Odd is convinced that this man is connected to some terrible catastrophe that is about to occur. To gather more information about him, Odd uses his gift of supernatural intuition, which his soulmate Bronwen (a.k.a. Stormy) Llewellyn calls &quot;psychic magnetism,&quot; to track him down.

Odd&#x27;s sixth sense leads him to Fungus Man&#x27;s home, and Odd begins to uncover more details about the man and a mysterious other-worldly link to the dark forces about to be unleashed on the town of Pico Mundo. Accompanied sometimes by the ghost of Elvis Presley and encountering other memorable spirits, including a murdered prostitute, Odd is soon deeply involved in an attempt to prevent the disastrous bloodshed he knows will happen the next day.

==Characters==

===Odd Thomas===

&quot;I see dead people. But then, by God, I do something about it.&quot; – Odd Thomas pg. 32

Odd could see the dead and also see shadowy figures that normally lurk around people that will cause deaths or will die. They are called bodachs and feed on the pain of others. Odd is a 20 year old short-order cook at a breakfast joint in Pico Mundo. His girlfriend is Stormy. Little Ozzie is his best friend. Odd leads a simple life because he has to, since he finds the job of speaking to the lingering dead complicated enough. Odd is an optimist seeing the good in most individuals despite his troubling life; he fears going anywhere with a large population because it would interfere with his &quot;simple life&quot;—he would be overwhelmed by the volume of dead in a large city like Los Angeles. He never told his father or mother because he thought that his father would use his son&#x27;s powers to make himself rich. He once met a boy who also saw bodachs but when the bodachs realized this, they seemed to cause a fatal accident, killing the little boy instantly, so Odd keeps this ability a secret.

===Stormy Llewellyn===
&quot;Loop me in, Odd One.&quot; – Stormy Llewellyn

Odd&#x27;s destiny. Stormy&#x27;s real name is Bronwen but she prefers to be called Stormy because she thinks this makes her sound less like an elf. She is the manager of an ice cream shop and hopes to own a shop of her own some day. Stormy&#x27;s parents died when she was very young. She was adopted by a couple when she was 7. Her foster father sexually molested her for almost 3 months. She reported him to a social worker and was moved to an orphanage where she lived until seventeen, at which point she was cared for by her uncle, Father Sean Llewellyn, rector of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s church. She remained under his legal guardianship until she could become independent. She is a strong believer in delayed gratification, that this life is a &quot;boot camp&quot; for the next, which she calls &quot;service,&quot; and that finally in the third life are the rewards. She insists on waiting for sex with Odd until marriage, hoping to make their first time together a meaningful experience and to not bring the memories of her abuse on their bed. She also is the only person who knows everything about Odd seeing the dead. She is killed in the first Odd Thomas novel during the mall shooting.

===Chief Wyatt Porter===

The Chief helps Odd many times, acting almost as a surrogate father. He is one of the few people who knows Odd sees the dead but he does not know all of Odd&#x27;s secrets. He is shot 4 times by one of the antagonists who would later shoot people at the mall but survives.

===Robert Thomas &quot;Fungus Man&quot; Robertson===

Fungus Man or Robert Thomas Robertson is initially portrayed as the main antagonist. He comes to Pico Mundo surrounded by bodachs and immediately Odd is suspicious of him. Little is explained about Robertson directly. Odd finds that he is obsessed with serial killers as evidenced by the files he keeps on them. Robertson was approached by Eckles, Varner, and Gosset a few months before the incident at the Green Moon Mall, having met them at a satanic cult gathering. They were interested only in his mother&#x27;s money. Eckles, Varner, and Gosset killed Robertson&#x27;s mother (with his permission) and gave him her ears as a trophy. Robertson is murdered by one of his conspirators when they find out that Odd&#x27;s attention is being drawn towards them and their plans. Robertson then becomes one of the lingering dead and stalks Odd for a short time as a poltergeist. When Robertson&#x27;s ghost confronts Odd at his home, he goes into an uncontrollable rage, destroying much of the kitchen. Odd leaves him there in the house where he is assumed to still be haunting.

===Bern Eckles, Simon Varner and Kevin Gosset===

These three had conspired with Robert Thomas Robertson to have a mass killing at the mall. The three had gotten involved in ritualistic satanism as teenagers and first killed when they were 15 on a &quot;dare.&quot; They pledged their loyalty to their &quot;dark god,&quot; vowing to go into careers in which they could promote satanism and chaos. Varner and Eckles became cops, while Gosset became a school teacher. Varner had killed Robert Thomas Robertson after he found out that Odd had been in Robertson&#x27;s house and suspected him, he then tried to frame Odd for the murder. Eckles and Varner were the two gunmen that Odd subdued: Eckles first with the bat then Varner with a shot to the shoulder and head. Gosset had shot Odd twice in the back, Odd managed to pull the wires out of the bomb, thereby disarming it as he fell to the ground. Gosset later told everything that had happened between all the conspirators. They called the atrocity &quot;just another way of worshipping.&quot;

===Little Ozzie===
Nicknamed &#x27;little&#x27; despite being larger than his father, Ozzie has a 6th finger on his left hand and has published many very successful detective novels. He has a pet cat named Terrible Chester who Ozzie claims is over 50 years old, and has pictures to prove it. Terrible Chester does not like Odd and Little Ozzie is one of the few people who knows about Odd&#x27;s &#x27;Gifts&#x27;.

==Odd Thomas film adaptation==

Novelist Dean Koontz told San Diego Comic-Con attendees on July 26, 2008, that he had a movie script adapted from his book &quot;Odd Thomas&quot; and he&#x27;s very pleased with the results. Koontz also teased that an unnamed actor has signed on to play the title character, but refused to reveal any further details. Koontz added that after reading the script, which was written by an unnamed screenwriter, he &#x27;fell over&#x27; because it was &#x27;so perfect.&#x27;

The unnamed writer was confirmed in November 2010 to be American filmmaker Stephen Sommers, who also handled the directing. The film was produced independently by Howard Kaplan and John Baldecchi.

It was announced in February 2011 that Anton Yelchin was cast to play the title role. After being delayed by a series of lawsuits, The Movie Insider reported that the film adaptation was scheduled for release in the United States on April 5, 2013. The movie did poorly at the box office and there will be no sequels with Anton Yelchin due to his tragic death on June 19, 2016.

The movie won the Saturn Award for Best DVD/Blu-Ray release in 2015 from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, &amp; Horror Films.

<doc id="1137789" wikidata="Q3503498" url="?curid=1137789" title="Noaidi">
<text>A noaidi (, , , , , , ) is a shaman of the Sami people in the Nordic countries, playing a role in Sámi religious practices. Most &quot;noaidi&quot; practices died out during the 17th century, most likely because they resisted Christianization of the Sámi people and the king&#x27;s authority. Their actions were referred to in courts as &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot; (cf. witchcraft). Several Sámi shamanistic beliefs and practices are similar to those of some Siberian cultures.

==Description and history==

Noaidis, often referred to as the &quot;Sámi shamans&quot;, are the traditional healers and protectors of the Sami people. Noaidis are considered to have the role of mediator between humans and the spirits. To undertake this mediation, the noaidi are believed to be able to communicate with the spirit world, and to ask what sacrifice needed to be made by a person so that he might return to good health and be successful in the hunt for food. Sacrifices designed by the noaidi are understood to reestablish a kind of balance between the mortal and immortal worlds.

Using a traditional drum, which is the most important symbol and tool of the Sámi noaidi, they invoke assistance from benevolent spirits and conducted out-of-body travel via the &quot;free soul&quot; with the help of other &quot;siida&quot; members. The Sámi distinguish between the &quot;free soul&quot; versus the more mundane &quot;body soul&quot;; the &quot;body soul&quot; is unable to traverse the divide separating the spiritual netherworld from the more mundane, corporeal, real world.

A noaidi can engage in any kind of affair that demands wisdom; it is said they take payments for their services. The activities include healing people, helping children, making decisions and protecting reindeer, which represents the most important source of food and are also used as tribute payment.

The sources from which we learn about noaidi are court protocols, tales, excavated tools such as belts, and missionary reports. That noaidis were punished and in some cases sentenced to death for their &quot;sorcery&quot; should perhaps rather be interpreted as an attempt to obliterate opposition to the crown. Prior to 1858, when the Conventicle Act was abolished, there was by law no freedom of religion, as the Lutheran Swedish church was the only allowed religion for Swedish citizens. Swedish priests supported conviction of noaidis for sorcery, and in 1693, Lars Nilsson was executed for this charge.

It has traditionally often been claimed that only men could become noaidi and use the drum, but both Rijkuo-Maja of Arvidsjaur (1661–1757) as well as Anna Greta Matsdotter of Vapsten, known as Silbo-gåmmoe or Gammel-Silba (1794–1870), were both noted to have done so.

==Remnants in music tradition==

In the Sami shamanistic form of worship drumming and traditional chanting (joiking) is of singular importance. Some of joiks are sung on shamanistic rites; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).

Recently, joiks have been sung in two different styles, one of which is sung only by young people. The other joik may be identified with the &quot;mumbling&quot; joik, resembling chants or magic spells.

Several surprising characteristics of joiks can be explained by comparing the music ideals, as observed in joiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. In some instances, joiks mimic natural sounds. This can be contrasted to other goals, namely overtone singing and bel canto, both of which exploit human speech organs to achieve &quot;superhuman&quot; sounds. Overtone singing and the imitation of sounds in shamanism are present in many other cultures as well. Sound imitation may serve other purposes such as games and other entertainment as well as important practical purposes such as luring animals during hunts.

<text>The Grasberg mine has one of the largest reserves of gold and copper in the world. It is located in Mimika Regency, Central Papua, Indonesia near Puncak Jaya. It is operated by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI, &quot;see below&quot;), a joint venture among the government of Indonesia, government of Central Papua, and American company Freeport-McMoRan (FCX).

FCX operates under a Contract of Work (CoW) agreement with the government of Indonesia, which allows Freeport to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in a area (Block A). It also conducts exploration activities in a area (Block B). At 31 December 2022 Grasberg had proven and probable mineral reserves of 30.8 billion pounds (14.0 million tonnes) of copper, 26.3 million ounces (808 tonnes) of gold and 121.3 million ounces (3773 tonnes) of silver. Grasberg has three underground mining operations: Grasberg Block Cave, Deep Mill Level Zone and Big Gossan. The 2023 production was of copper, of gold and of silver. The concentrate is delivered by pipeline to Amamapare.

In August 2017, FCX announced that it will divest its ownership in PTFI so that Indonesia owns 51%. In return the CoW will be replaced by a special license (IUPK) with mining rights to 2041 and FCX will build a new smelter by 2022.

== History ==
In 1936, Dutch geologist Jean Jacques Dozy was a member of an expedition that scaled Mount Carstensz (now called Puncak Jaya), the highest mountain in the Dutch East Indies. While there, he made notes of a peculiar black rock with greenish coloring, and spent several weeks estimating the extent of the gold and copper deposits in the area. In 1939, he filed a report about the &quot;Ertsberg&quot; (Dutch for &quot;ore mountain&quot;). He was working for Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM), an exploration company formed in 1935 by Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary) (40%), Standard Vacuum Oil Company (40%) and Far Pacific investments (a Standard Oil of California subsidiary) (20%).

Dozy&#x27;s Ertsberg report came to light again in 1959 when Jan van Gruisen, managing director of the Dutch company Oost Borneo Maatschappij N.V, or East Borneo Company, searched for geological studies on nickel deposits in Western New Guinea. Although the Dozy report did not mention nickel, Van Gruisen applied to the Netherlands government for an exploration concession for an area of surrounding Ertsberg. In March 1959, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an article revealing the Dutch were searching for the mountain source of alluvial gold that had been washed into the Arafura Sea. Van Gruisen casually mentioned the Dozy report to Forbes Wilson, geologist and vice president of Freeport Minerals Co., who immediately recognized the mining potential of Ertsberg. Wilson convinced Freeport to back an expedition to explore the Ertsberg site, and in 1960 led an exploration party on an arduous, 6 week long trek to Ertsberg that confirmed the presence of an immense amount of copper mineralization. The directors of Freeport Sulphur at the time included Godfrey Rockefeller, Texaco chairman Augustus Long, George Mealey, and Robert Lovett.

In 1963 the administration of Dutch New Guinea was transferred to Indonesia, and the mine was the first under the new Suharto administration&#x27;s 1967 foreign investment laws intended to attract foreign investment to Indonesia&#x27;s then ruined economy. Built at 4,100 metres (14,000 ft) above sea level in one of Papua&#x27;s most remote areas, it involved a capital and technology input well beyond Indonesia&#x27;s resources at the time. Construction cost was $175 million, $55 million above the original budget. A 116 km road and pipeline, port, airstrip, power plant and a new town called Tembagapura (literally: &quot;copper town&quot;) were built. It officially opened in 1973 (although the first ore shipment was in December 1972), and was expanded by Ertsberg East, which opened in 1981. Steep aerial tramways are used to transport equipment and people. Ore is dropped 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the mine, concentrated and mixed with water to form a 60:40 slurry. The slurry is then pumped through a 166 km pipeline through mountains, jungle and swamp to the port at Amamapare, dried and shipped.

In 1977 the rebel group Free Papua Movement attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, killing at least 800 people.

By the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at &quot;Grasberg&quot; (Dutch, &quot;Grass Mountain&quot;), from the Ertsberg mine. The construction of the winding road to Grasberg, the H.E.A.T. (Heavy Equipment Access Trail), was estimated to cost $12 million to $15 million to build. An Indonesian road-builder, Ilyas Hamid, who had contributed to the Ertsberg road took a bulldozer and drove it downhill tracing the path. The road cost just $2 million when completed.

The 2003–2006 boom in copper prices increased the profitability of the mine. The extra consumption of copper for Asian electrical infrastructure overwhelmed copper supply and caused prices to increase from around $1500/ton to $8100/ton ($0.70/lb to $4.00/lb).

In 2005, the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004 Freeport had given senior military and police officers and military units nearly $20 million.

== Company ==

PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) is the company that currently manages Grasberg mine. The mining company is a joint venture between Indonesian and American interests, with the Indonesian government through its state-owned company PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (MIND ID) and PT Indonesia Papua Metal &amp; Mineral, a company co-owned by MIND ID and government of Papua, owning a 51.23% stake and Freeport-McMoRan owning 48.77%. 

PT Freeport Indonesia was previously 90.64% owned by Freeport-McMoRan, including 9.36% owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama.

Since 2018 in negotiation on extending the permit of the mining operation the government of Indonesia negotiated ownership of 51.23% of the company, while Freeport-McMoRan owned 48.77%. PT Indocopper Investama also changed its name to PT Indonesia Papua Metal &amp; Mineral.

Indonesia also agreed to extend the Freeport-McMoRan mining lease, which would have expired in 2021, for a further 20 years until 2041.

== Mine workings ==

The workings include a large open pit mine wide at the surface completed in 2019, three operating underground mines (Grasberg Block Cave, Deep Mill Level Zone and Big Gossan) and four concentrators. The mine is a high-volume, low-cost underground mining operation, producing and milling more than 72 million tonnes of ore in 2023.

Ore undergoes primary crushing at the mine, before being delivered by ore passes to the mill complex for further crushing, grinding and flotation. Grasberg&#x27;s milling and concentrating complex is the largest in the world, with four crushers and two giant semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) units processing a daily average of 240,000 tonnes of ore in 2006.

A flotation reagent is used to separate a copper-gold concentrate from the ore. Slurry containing the copper-gold concentrate is delivered by three pipelines to the seaport of Amamapare, over away, where it is dewatered. Once filtered and dried, the concentrate – containing copper, gold and silver – is shipped to smelters around the world.

The facilities at the port include a coal-fired power station supplying the Grasberg operations, which will be replaced in 2027 by a 265-megawatt liquefied natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine power plant.

== Environment ==

The concentrator&#x27;s tailings, generated at a rate of 700,000 tonnes per day, are the subject of considerable environmental concern, as they wash into the Aikwa riverine system and Arafura Sea. Some (eventually ) of lowland areas along the Aikwa River, are covered by braided sedimentary channels indicative of high sediment load (similar to glacial runoff). Native fish have nearly disappeared from now-turbid waters of the Aikwa River, which are unsuitable for aquatic life. The overburden (700 kt/d) remains in the highlands, up to 480 m deep and covering . Its acidic runoff, dissolved copper, and the finer material gets washed into the headwaters of the Wanagon River. It settles out along the river course and then into the ocean, and will continue to do so indefinitely. Freeport&#x27;s official response is that overburden is placed in the highlands as part of its Overburden Management Plan, at &quot;sites capped with limestone and constantly monitored. Tailings are transported to the lowlands in a designated river system. Once reaching the lowlands, they are captured in an engineered system of levees built for that purpose.&quot; An Indonesian Environment Ministry&#x27;s field report from 2004 found sediment levels of 37,500 milligrams per litre as the river entered the lowlands and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea, while the maximum under Indonesian law is 400 milligrams per litre.

In 1995, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) revoked Freeport&#x27;s insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US. It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them. Freeport argued that an environmental report reached inaccurate conclusions, the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg. The company later underwent an independent environmental audit by Dames &amp; Moore and got a clean bill of health. In April 1996, Freeport canceled its policy with the OPIC, stating that their corporate activities had outgrown the policy&#x27;s limits. The OPIC report was later publicly released.

=== Environmental damage ===
While landscape reclamation projects have begun at the mine, environmental groups and local citizens are concerned with the potential for copper contamination and acid mine drainage from the mine tailings into surrounding river systems, land surfaces, and groundwater. Freeport argues that its actions meet industry standards and have been approved by the requisite authorities. It was reported in 2005 that since 1997 Freeport had been breaching Indonesian environmental laws. Freeport estimated it will generate six billion tons of waste.

Freeport has been excluded from the investment portfolio of The Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world&#x27;s second-largest pension fund, due to criticism over the environmental damages caused by the Grasberg mine. Its partner in Grasberg, Rio Tinto, was also excluded during the period 2008–2019. Stocks at a value of ca. US$870 million were divested from the fund as a result of the decisions.

== Attacks on the mine ==
Violent ambushes near the Grasberg mine have occurred as early as August 2002, when Rickey Lynn Spier, Leon Edwin Burgon, and Bambang Riwanto, three contract school teachers were killed in the attack. Kopassus, the Indonesian Special Forces, allegedly instigated the incident. Independent activists alleged multiple incidents such as the August 2002 attack appear to have been instigated by Indonesian forces, some including the TNI, &quot;Tentara Nasional Indonesia&quot;, who are not fully subsidized by the government, leaving them dependent on being the source of security for extractive companies in an area such as Freeport. The need for profit motivates planned incidents such as these resulting in the “need” for increased protection of the mine sites. These incidents have increased when Freeport&#x27;s security needs have decreased. Although investigations by Polda Papua and FBI confirmed the perpetrator to be Antonius Wamang, JH, MK, DM, AA, GM, JK, EO, and YD. They were arrested in 2006 based on fingerprint evidences on all four crime scenes. Wamang died in 2022, and his relative confirmed he was member of OPM, who in 1980s left his family and joined TPNPB, by 1999 he was appointed Kalikopi faction operation commander by Kelly Kwalik, whose area of operation included the Grasberg mine.

A series of attacks started on 11 July 2009 and continued for more than five days. A Freeport employee, 29-year-old Australian Drew Grant was shot and killed while sitting in the back of a car on the way to a game of golf. Indonesian police indicated that Grant was killed by five shots he sustained to the neck, chest and stomach by unknown assailants using military-issue weapons. The attack also killed Freeport security guard Markus Ratealo and a number of police officers.

On 7 April 2011, two Freeport employees were killed when the company car they were traveling in caught fire. Bullets were found inside the car, giving weight to the suspicion that the car was fired on by unknown gunmen. This incident sparked a protest by hundreds of Freeport employees concerned about the security along the jungle road leading up to the mine.

The Grasberg mine has been a frequent source of friction in Papua. Causes of friction are the mine&#x27;s environmental impact on Papua, the perceived low share of profits going to local Papuans (Freeport&#x27;s annual report shows it made $4.1billion in operating profit on revenue of $6.4billion in 2010) and the questionable legality of the payments made to Indonesian security forces for their services to guard the site.

==Accidents and incidents==
In 2003, a landslide killed eight workers. A government investigation concluded that the incident was the result of negligence. Important warning signs had been detected two days prior. In response to this, management moved some equipment, but did not keep workers out of the area. A month later two workers died from exposure to sulfur fumes. The government ultimately overturned the investigation&#x27;s conclusion, and attributed the incident to natural causes.

In 2013, a roof collapse in the Big Gossan Mine underground training centre trapped 38 workers. Only 10 survived. The miners were trapped inside a lower chamber while attending a refresher training course on work safety in underground mining areas. The absence of a secondary escape route was critical to the loss of life. According to the Freeport McMoran geological team, the collapse at the Big Gossan tunnel was caused by erosion of the ceiling, brought about by the continuous infiltration of the limestone wallrocks by corrosive acidic groundwater. Freeport was accused of negligence by the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission.

===Strikes===
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:

On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.

In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.

In 2017, 5,000 workers at the mine participated in a labor strike that lasted over 4 months.

<doc id="1137793" wikidata="Q3832261" url="?curid=1137793" title="Light Cycle">
<text>The Light Cycle is a type of fictional motorcycle featured in the &quot;Tron&quot; franchise. First introduced in the film &quot;Tron&quot;, they are used as part of a deadly virtual game conducted by the villainous Master Control Program. In it, players must ride around an arena without crashing into each other, the outer walls, or the light trails left behind by the vehicles. Subsequent generations of Light Cycles appeared in later works of media.

Following its appearance in &quot;Tron&quot;, the Light Cycle became a fixture of popular culture. The first Light Cycle sequence was also seen as a pioneering moment in computer graphics that inspired later works.

== Characteristics ==

Light Cycles are virtual and futuristic motorcycles that materialize from thin air, starting with the handlebars. They are neon-colored and move at extreme levels of speed. They are only able to turn at right angles, creating blocky trails of color. The arena in which they are used features a white grid on black ground, marking the distance the Light Cycles travel.

== Development ==
Light Cycles were designed by artist Syd Mead. They were initially rendered digitally. The Light Cycle sequence in &quot;Tron&quot; was developed by MAGi in Westchester County, New York. It takes place over a length of about three minutes, which is interspersed with one minute of live-action footage.

For &quot;&quot;, the Light Cycle was redesigned by Daniel Simon. Five prop Light Cycles were built in real life, with four of them being destroyed post-production. The final one was purchased by Xiao Yu, a collector based in Nanjing, China; however, he was told by the authorities that it was not street-legal.

== Reception ==
Light Cycles became well known in popular culture as one of the first mainstream cinematic appearances of a sports bike , and have been called symbols of futurism and posthumanism. In an analysis, author Esperanza Miyake interpreted the Light Cycles of the original &quot;Tron&quot; as representations of male power: only men get the chance to ride them, while the sole female character, Lora, does not. Their speed showed male dominance and control over technology, representing the means to &quot;escape&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Light Cycle sequence inspired John Lasseter, who was then working at Disney, to enter computer animation; he went on to direct &quot;Toy Story&quot;, crediting its creation to &quot;Tron&quot;.

The Light Cycle design served as the basis for a roller coaster called &quot;Tron&quot; Lightcycle Power Run, which opened in Shanghai Disneyland in 2016 and Magic Kingdom in 2023, the latter in which it is known as &quot;Tron&quot; Lightcycle / Run.

<doc id="1137796" wikidata="Q16872" url="?curid=1137796" title="Aaron Kwok">
<text>Aaron Kwok Fu-shing (born 26 October 1965) is a Hong Kong singer, dancer, actor and racing driver, known as one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; and the &quot;God of Dance&quot;. Active since the 1980s, he has released over 30 studio albums in Cantonese and Mandarin, mostly in the dance-pop genre, with elements of rock, R&amp;B, soul, electronica and traditional Chinese music.

Concurrently with his music career, Kwok started as an actor with a role in the TVB television drama &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1987), followed by &quot;Twilight of a Nation&quot; (1988), &quot;Man from Guangdong&quot; (1991), &quot;Heartstrings&quot; (1994), and &quot;Wars of Bribery&quot; (1996). He gained widespread recognition in the movie &quot;Saviour of the Soul&quot; (1991), for which he was nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. His notable films include &quot;Future Cops&quot; (1993), &quot;China Strike Force&quot; (2000), &quot;Divergence&quot; (2005), &quot;After This Our Exile&quot; (2006), &quot;Cold War&quot; (2012), &quot;Port of Call&quot; (2015), for which he received a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor, &quot;Cold War 2&quot; (2016), and &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Kwok graduated from St John&#x27;s Co-education College in Hong Kong. After graduating from secondary school, Kwok worked as a junior staff in King Fook Gold &amp; Jewellery Co. Ltd. His father, who owns a small gold retail store, wanted him to gain experience in the business with the view of eventually handing the family business over to him. If not for one of Kwok&#x27;s brothers taking over the gold business, his father would not have allowed him to join the entertainment industry. In 1984, he was fired for prolonged absenteeism (sick leave) caused by a foot muscle injury from trying the splits at a party.

In 1991, Kwok&#x27;s older brother, Kwok Fu-kun, was shot dead outside the Sunbeam Theatre in North Point while chasing armed robbers who had raided his Marble Street jewelry store.

==Career==

===Early years===
After being fired from a jewellery company in 1984 at the age of 19, Kwok only had a high school education and had never studied dancing in university before. Kwok subsequently joined a dancer training course at TVB, where his talent for dancing was immediately recognized. Kwok then performed in music videos and variety shows for other singers. In 1987, he was transferred to the acting department of the talent training course and became a TV actor, where he played minor parts in TVB dramas. In 1990, he did a TV commercial in Taiwan for the Honda motorcycle DJ-1RR. The commercial gained him instant popularity with Taiwanese girls, and he immediately burst onto the music scene.

===Music===

Kwok then began his music career with three mandopop albums including the famous song &quot;Loving You Forever&quot; (對你愛不完) to accompany his dance moves. After his success in Taiwan, he returned to Hong Kong in 1991 to do Cantopop. The next few years saw his popularity reach fever-pitch, and he was soon ranked as one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot;. Kwok became one of Hong Kong and Asia&#x27;s most prominent pop stars. He won his first major awards with the 1991 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards and 1991 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.

Janet Jackson collaborated with Aaron Kwok and Ricky Martin for international versions of &quot;Ask for More&quot;, a promotional single and commercial released as part of an advertising campaign for Pepsi. A full-length music video of the version with Kwok was also released in Asian markets.

===Dancer===
As soon as Kwok entered the music industry in 1991, he started a fast-dancing trend (勁歌熱舞). Kwok&#x27;s onstage dancing and displays has been known to be influenced by Michael Jackson. Later in his career, he is known to have won a prestigious top ten Hong Kong dance award (十大舞蹈家年獎). Of all the performing arts at which Kwok excels, stage appearances remain his perennial favourite. His dance accomplishments are also matched with stage displays. On 16 November 2007, he held an &quot;Aaron Kwok De Show Reel Live&quot; concert at Hong Kong Coliseum with the largest revolving stage. On 17 February 2008, he held an &quot;Aaron Kwok De Show Reel Extension Live&quot; concert at the Hong Kong AsiaWorld Arena with the largest revolving stage measured at 10m x 9.44m and created a new entry for the Guinness Book of World Records.

===Acting===

Over the years, Kwok has also been active in other media such as TV commercials and acting. He began his acting career with the TVB series &quot;Rise of Genghis Khan&quot;, and the 1988 series &quot;Twilight of a Nation&quot; about the Taiping Rebellion. One of his more noticeable role was for the 1996 TVB drama series &quot;Wars of Bribery&quot; where he plays an ICAC special-agent with Athena Chu.

He also starred in various movies. At the Taiwan&#x27;s 42nd Golden Horse Awards ceremony on 13 November 2005, Kwok was the surprise winner of Best Leading Actor award for his role in the film &quot;Divergence&quot;. It was Kwok&#x27;s first Golden Horse nomination and beat veteran Hong Kong star Tony Leung Ka-fai to win the honour. He won the Best Actor Award again at the 43rd Golden Horse Awards on 24 November 2006 for his role in the film &quot;After This Our Exile&quot;. He became only the second actor in the history of the Golden Horse Awards to win the Best Actor Award consecutively. Jackie Chan first accomplished this back in the 1992-3. Kwok gained acclaim for his role in the AIDS-themed film &quot;Love for Life,&quot; co-starring Zhang Ziyi, in 2010. In 2016, Kwok won his first Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor for his role in the crime thriller film, &quot;Port of Call&quot;, at the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards.

== Personal life ==
Kwok has been romantically linked with several models and celebrities, including Cecilia Yiu, Christy Chung, Athena Chu, Norika Fujiwara, Lynn Hung, and Amanda Strang. However, he never publicly confirmed any of these relationships. His longest-known relationship was purportedly with Lynn Hung, lasting from 2006 to 2013. When rumors of their breakup surfaced, Kwok stirred controversy by comparing women to shoes: &quot;When a pair of shoes doesn&#x27;t fit and makes your feet uncomfortable, you may want to switch to a more comfortable pair. Similarly, with a partner, you should find someone suitable. Forcing it will only lead to pain.&quot;

Kwok acknowledged his relationship with Chinese influencer and model Moka Fang in 2015. They married in Hong Kong in 2017. Later that year, Fang gave birth to their first daughter Chantelle In 2019, she gave birth to their second daughter Charlotte.

Some of his collections include the McLaren Senna, Pagani Zonda F, Ferrari F50, Enzo Ferrari, Ferrari FXX-K, Ferrari Testarossa, Ferrari F355, Ferrari 360, Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, Ferrari California, Ferrari F430 Spider, Lamborghini Diablo SE30, Lamborghini Murciélago, Lamborghini Gallardo, Lamborghini Aventador. Other cars include the Porsche 911 Turbo, Porsche 911 GT3 RS, Porsche 996 GT3, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes-Benz SL600, Mercedes CLK DTM AMG, Audi R8 GT Spyder, Nissan GT-R and Zeekr 009.

In 2011, Kwok became a race-horse owner at the Hong Kong Jockey Club. He originally owned two horses: N288 CALLING WITH LOVE and another named P288 MY FAVORITE. In 2018, he purchased a new horse named C180 DANCING FIGHTER. Kwok is also well known to be a super fan of Chinese hotpot.

===Image===

He was famous for popularising a new type of &quot;center-split hair style&quot; that was widely imitated during the 1990s. As a fashion icon amongst the show biz industry, throughout his career he changed his hair style numerous times, including styles such as the five-five split and the four-six split. In 2020, he became the brand ambassador of HSBC Jade in Hong Kong with advertisements that shared his own beneficial experience of using its banking services.

<text>Jean Jacques Dozy (18 June 1908, in Rotterdam – 1 November 2004, in The Hague) was a Dutch geologist.

In 1936, he participated in the Dutch Carstensz Expedition in Dutch New Guinea to explore and climb Mount Carstensz, the highest mountain of the island of New Guinea. Besides succeeding in climbing the highest point at the time with Anton Colijn and Frits Wissel, Dozy discovered the presence of abundant copper ore in a mountain he called Ertsberg (English, &quot;Ore mountain&quot;). Years later this gave rise to the Grasberg copper mine. In 1939, he published an article about his find, but it was neglected due to World War II. Twenty years later, the article led to rediscovery of the Ertsberg and the development of the Ertsberg-Grasberg mine complex.

<text>Gūwalgiya was one of the most powerful Manchu clans. It is often listed by historians as the first of the eight prominent Manchu clans of the Qing dynasty. After the demise of the dynasty, some of its descendants sinicized their clan name to the Han Chinese surname &quot;Guan&quot; ().

== History ==

=== Origins and Early History ===
The Gūwalgiya clan can be traced back to the Jurchen people, specifically the Jianzhou Jurchen tribes. The Name &quot;Gūwalgiya&quot; originally had been referred to a geographical location and later on was adopted as a clan name. The clan is believed to have originated from the Yalu River region (present-day Liaoning Province), around the area known as Sā&#x27;ěrhǔ (萨尔浒).

During the late 16th century, Gūwalgiya Gāha, the son of Gūwalgiya Sōngāli, became the chieftain of Sā&#x27;ěrhǔ (萨尔浒) and allied with Nurhaci, the founder of the Later Jin dynasty. This alliance was an important piece in the establishment of the Later Jin and later the Qing Dynasty. The Gūwalgiya clan played an important role in Nurhaci&#x27;s military efforts, especially during the Battle of Sarhū. Their involvement in the war earned them a prominent position among the rising Manchu nobility.

== Structure and Branches ==
The Clan is composed of several branches, each contributing to its legacy.

Suwan Gūwalgiya is well known for its power and historical significance. It produced many influential leaders and military figures during the Qing dynasty. These leaders played a vital role in the clan&#x27;s influence in the Manchu nobility.

Yehe Gūwalgiya was recognized for its important military role. It has participated in several major conflicts that changed the political situation in Northeast Asia. Their strategic thinking and combat skills helped the clan succeed in these conflicts.

Hada Gūwalgiya made significant contributions to the administration of the Qing Dynasty. They helped organize the government and establish a stable rule over new territories that the Qing had taken control of.

Ula Gūwalgiya played a vital role in military defense and local governance. They were responsible for protecting the clan&#x27;s interests and ensuring their influence in various military campaigns.

Shushu Gūwalgiya is known for its cultural contributions. They played a vital role in preserving and promoting cultural traditions. Throughout history, several prominent figures from the branch emerged as scholars, and cultural icons.

== Notable Military efforts ==
The Gūwalgiya clan has a rich military history, participating in several key conflicts that were an vital role in the establishment of the Qing Dynasty.

=== The Battle of Sarhu (1619) ===

Among the Gwalgiya clan&#x27;s most significant conflicts was the Battle of Sarhu (1619). It was a war between Nurhaci, ruler of the Later Jin, and the combined forces of the Ming and various Jurchen tribes.

The Gūwalgiya clan, under the leadership of Gūwalgiya Gaha, played an important role in this battle. Their military forces used smart strategies and strong fighting skills, which were an vital piece in helping Nurhaci to victory. The victory at Sarhū not only strengthened Nurhaci&#x27;s power but also changed the fight against the Ming Dynasty.

<text>is a Japanese term used in modern martial arts as well as in tea ceremony, flower arranging, Go, shogi, academic tests and other similar activities to designate various grades, levels or degrees of proficiency or experience. In Mandarin Chinese, the same character is pronounced jí, and the term is used for academic tests. In Korea, the term geup () is used (also transliterated as gup or kup). In Vietnamese martial arts, it is known as cấp (&quot;khớp&quot;).

==History==
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department started a ranking system using &quot;kyū&quot; to measure the police officers&#x27; ability in Kendo. Grades were from 8th to 1st.

In the 1890s, the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society introduced the &quot;dan&quot; and &quot;kyū&quot; ranking system to various martial arts in Japan.

==Martial arts usage==
In modern Japanese martial arts, &quot;kyū&quot;-level practitioners hold the ranks below &quot;dan&quot; or black belt. The &quot;kyū&quot; ranking system varies from art to art and school to school. In some arts, all the &quot;kyū&quot;-level practitioners wear white belts while in others different coloured belts, tags or stripes are used; in &quot;kendo&quot; for example the belt system is not used. Although some aikido schools do use a coloured belt system the norm is for &quot;kyū&quot; grades to wear a white belt, and for &quot;dan&quot; grades to wear a black belt. &quot;Kyū&quot;-level practitioners are often called , &quot;ones without rank, and are considered as initiates rather than students. When practitioners have reached the ranking of first degree black belt, they become . The holder of a black belt of any degree is a , &quot;one with rank.

==Academic tests usage==
Martial arts&#x27; organizations are not the only ones who use such a system. Some academic and professional organizations also use &quot;kyū&quot; and &quot;dan&quot; as measures of a person&#x27;s ability. For instance, the Japan Kanji Aptitude Test which tests a person&#x27;s ability to correctly read, write, and use kanji, is graded using &quot;kyū&quot;.
==List of kyū ranks==
&quot;Kyū&quot; ranks progress using a descending order system, so 1st &quot;kyū&quot; is the highest. For example, the first &quot;kyū&quot; outranks the 2nd &quot;kyū&quot;. The &quot;Dan&quot; ranking system starts after 1st &quot;kyū&quot;. Essentially, the &quot;kyū&quot; is the number of steps before reaching mastery whereas the &quot;dan&quot; gives steps &quot;into&quot; mastery.

Pre-1st &quot;kyū&quot; and pre-2nd &quot;kyū&quot; are used in examinations of languages, because it is often hard to pass the examinations at 1st and 2nd &quot;kyū&quot;.

The lowest &quot;kyū&quot; is sometimes called &quot;Mukyū&quot; () which means &quot;ungraded&quot; in English. The lowest &quot;kyū&quot; depends on organizations. For instance, the United States Judo Federation has 12th &quot;kyū&quot; as the lowest grade for junior class, and 7th &quot;kyū&quot; as the lowest for adult class.

In Japan, the difficulty is classified into three categories as in the following list:

==Coloured belts==
In some styles, students wear white belts until they receive their first &quot;dan&quot; rank or black belt, while in others a range of colors are used for different &quot;kyū&quot; grades. The wearing of coloured belts is often associated with &quot;kyū&quot; ranks, particularly in modern martial arts such as karate and judo (where the practice originated). However, there is no standard association of belt colours with particular ranks and different schools and organizations assign colours independently; see Rank in Judo for examples of variation within an art. However, white is often the lowest ranked belt and brown is the highest &quot;kyū&quot; rank, and it is common to see the darker colors associated with the higher ranks, i.e., the closest to black belt. Historically, students of martial arts would only have one belt or obi, which they would hand-dye when the next ranking was achieved. From a dyer&#x27;s perspective, the colours must progress from light to dark. 

The system of using different colored belts to mark rank is not universally accepted in the martial arts. Supporters of the belt colors point out their use as a simple visual key for experience, such as in matching opponents for sparring, allowing opponents to somewhat accurately judge each other&#x27;s skill, and to split them for competitions. Those who oppose the use of coloured belts are also often concerned that students will worry too much about relative rank, and become arrogant with trivial promotions and differences, while supporters feel that by providing small signs of success and recognition, students are more confident, and their training is more structured, and that the ranking system encourages higher-ranked students to assist lower-ranked ones, and lower-ranked students to respect their seniors.

<text>Ali Amini (; 12 September 1905–12 December 1992) was an Iranian politician who was the Prime Minister of Iran from 1961 to 1962. He held several cabinet portfolios during the 1950s, and served as a member of parliament between 1947 and 1949.

Amini was widely regarded as &quot;a &quot;protégé&quot; of the United States&quot; and a &quot;pro-American liberal reformer&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Amini was born on 12 September 1905 in Tehran. He was a grandson of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar through his mother, Fakhr-ol-Dowleh. His father was a significant statesman during the Qajar era, Mohsen Amin-ol-dowleh.

He completed his studies first in Dar ol-fonoon and then in France where he graduated with a degree in law from Grenoble University, followed by his PhD in economics from Paris. His PhD thesis was concerned with the foreign trade monopoly in Iran.

Upon his return to Iran, he was employed at the Ministry of Justice by Ali-Akbar Davar.

==Career==

Amini was a founding member of the Democrat Party of Iran, and entered the 15th term of parliament with the party&#x27;s ticket. His first ministerial portfolio was in the cabinet of Ali Mansur.

He served as a minister in the cabinet of Mohammad Mosaddegh, but broke away from Mosaddegh in July 1952. He was later regarded as a &quot;traitor&quot; by the National Front, because of his collaboration with the post-1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état government. He became minister of economic affairs in the cabinet of Fazlollah Zahedi and remained in office until 1955. He was then appointed as the justice minister under Hossein Ala&#x27; in 1955. He was named the ambassador to the US in 1956 which he held until 1958.

His tendencies were pro-American to the extent that they made the Shah uncomfortable. Mohammad Reza Shah in particular distrusted Amini&#x27;s popularity and friendship with then-senator John F. Kennedy. Therefore, his tenure ended in 1958.

In the 1950s, Amini was a candidate for the premiership. He was appointed prime minister in 1961. In July 1962, however, he was replaced by the Shah&#x27;s close friend and a major Birjand landowner Asadollah Alam. In the late 1970s, Amini attempted a comeback into Iranian politics at the age of 70. He served as an advisor to the Shah during the final days of the Pahlavi dynasty.

==Personal life==
Amini married Batoul Voosough (died 1992) in 1932 and they had a son, Iraj. She was the daughter of Hasan Vosugh od-Dowleh whose brother was Ahmad Qavam.

==Honours==
Amini was awarded Grand Croix of the Legion of Honor in 1962.

==Later years and death==
In 1979 and following the Iranian Revolution, Amini moved to Paris, France. There he headed the Front for the Liberation of Iran, a monarchist opposition group. He complained about internal struggles among the exiled Iranian monarchists, saying &quot;We&#x27;re not even back in Tehran [and] they quarrel over the name of the country&#x27;s future prime minister.&quot; He wrote his biography published by Harvard University.

He died in Paris on 12 December 1992, aged 87. His body was buried in Passy Cemetery.

<text>Gusu (died 234, r. 214–234) was the sixth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of the 5th king Chogo. He became king upon Chogo&#x27;s death in 214 which was the 49th year of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;he was seven feet tall and unusually exceptional in his power&quot;.

==Reign==

Even assuming that the dates given in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; are accurate, Baekje through Gusu&#x27;s reign was probably a confederacy, not yet a kingdom.

In 216, he prevailed against the Mohe forces at Sado Castle, and in 222, he destroyed a 5,000-strong force of Silla, the rival Korean kingdom. However, the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records many Baekje defeats against the Mohe and Silla, as well as natural disasters towards the end of Gusu&#x27;s reign.

Samguk sagi:
* 216 AD, autumn, eighth month. The Mohe came and surrounded Jeokhyeon Fortress. The lord of the fortress repelled them, and the bandits retreated. The King led 800 choice cavalry in pursuit of them, and fought them near Sado Fortress, and broke them. Many of them were killed or captured.
* 217 AD, spring, second month. Twin palisades were constructed alongside Sado Fortress, and from east to west they ran in parallel for 10 ri. The people of Jeokhyeon were divided and some made to defend the palisade.
* 218 AD, the king led soldiers to surround Jangsan Fortress of Silla. The king of Silla (Naehae of Silla) himself led and army out to attack them, and the Baekje army was defeated.
* 221 AD, summer, fifth month. In the east of the country there was great rainfall, and the mountains collapsed in more than 40 places. Sixth month, last day of the month. There was a solar eclipse. Autumn, eighth month. There was a great examination of the area to the west of the Han River.
* 222 AD, spring, second month. Commissioners were ordered to repair the dikes and embankments. Third month. The king made a proclamation encouraging production of agriculture. Summer, sixth month. It rained fish in the capital. Winter, tenth month. Soldiers were dispatched to Udujin in Silla, and the inhabitants were robbed and kidnapped. The Sillan general Chunghwon led 5,000 soldiers to counter-attack, and at Ungok Fortress they made a great rout of the Baekje forces. Only the cavalry escaped. 11th month, last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse.
* 224 AD, autumn, seventh month. The Sillan Ilgil XYeonchin came and invaded. Our army counter-attacked near Mt. Bongsan but could not overcome them. Winter, tenth month. Venus was seen.
* 227 AD, spring, third month. It hailed. Summer, fourth month. There was a great drought. The king prayed in the eastern court of Jumong, and it rained.
* 229 AD, winter, tenth month. The king hunted at a cold spring. 11th month. There was a great pestilence. The Mohe came to the borders of Ugok Fortress and kidnapped the people there. The King led 300 spirited soldiers to repel them. The bandits hid themselves, then came to attack, the Baekje army suffered a great defeat.
* 231 AD, summer, fourth month. There was hail the size of chestnuts. Some of the birds that were struck died.
* 234 AD, the king died.

==Legacy==
Upon Gusu&#x27;s death, his eldest son Saban briefly became the 7th king. Saban was dethroned by Goi, reported as Chogo&#x27;s brother in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, but believed to be of a rival royal line by modern scholars. Indicating continuing rivalry between the two lines, Gusu&#x27;s second son became the 11th king Biryu, and the name of the 14th king Geungusu indicates descent from the Gusu line.

==Family==
* Father: Chogo of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Queen(s): unknown
*** 1st son: 7th King, Saban of Baekje (沙泮王, ?–234) – before he was king he was known as Buyeo Sai (扶餘沙伊).
**** Descendant: 11th King, Biryu of Baekje (比流王, ?–344) – before he was king he was known as Buyeo Biryu (扶餘比流); recorded as son of Gusu in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; but because of date discrepancies scholars now believe he was a grandson of Gusu.
**** Descendant: Buyeo Ubok (扶餘優福, ?–?) – in 321 he was appointed Minister of the Interior (&quot;Naeshinjoapyung&quot;, 內臣佐平) and in 327 he started a rebellion against his brother Biryu but it was stopped.

<text>Liu Xiang (77–6BCE), born Liu Gengsheng and bearing the courtesy name Zizheng, was a Chinese astronomer, historian, librarian, poet, politician, and writer of the Western Han dynasty. Among his polymathic scholarly specialties were history, literary bibliography, and astronomy. He is particularly well known for his bibliographic work in cataloging and editing the extensive imperial library.

==Life==
Liu Gengsheng was born in Xuzhou. Being a distant relative of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, he was a member of the ruling dynastic clan (the Liu family). Liu Xiang&#x27;s father ranked as a marquess. Liu Xiang&#x27;s son, Liu Xin, would continue the scholarly tradition of his father and his relative Liu An (the Prince of Huainan).

By the beginning of Emperor Yuan&#x27;s reign, Liu Xiang was a member of a group of Confucian officials, including Xiao Wangzhi, who wished to limit the power of the emperor&#x27;s female family members relatives&#x27; clans, the Shi and the Xu. He ended up on the losing side of a power struggle between the powerful eunuch&#x27;s Hong Gong and Shi Xian. Briefly imprisoned, Liu Xiang was terminated from his official position, and he received no new appointments to the office for the next fifteen years.

The succession of Emperor Cheng to the imperial throne was accompanied by a realignment of power among the various factions involved in government, and Liu Xiang was able to revive his official prospects. In 26 BCE, at the command of the emperor, Liu Xiang spent much of the rest of the 20-odd years of his life engaged in the massive bibliographic work of organizing the imperial library. This work was assisted by his son, Liu Xin, who finally completed the task after his father&#x27;s death.

==Works==
Liu compiled the first catalogue of the imperial library, the &quot;Abstracts&quot; &quot;Bielu&quot;), and is the first known editor of the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; (&quot;Shanhaijing&quot;), which was finished by his son. Liu also edited collections of stories and biographies, including the &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot; (&quot;Zhanguoce&quot;), the &quot;New Prefaces&quot; (, &quot;Xinxu&quot;), the &quot;Garden of Stories&quot; (, &quot;Shuoyuan&quot;), and the &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women&quot; (&quot;Lienüzhuan&quot;). He has long erroneously been credited with compiling the &quot;Biographies of the Immortals&quot; (&quot;Liexian Zhuan&quot;), a collection of Taoist hagiographies and hymns.

Liu Xiang was also a poet. He is credited with the &quot;Nine Laments&quot; (&quot;Jiu Tan&quot;) that appears in the &quot;Songs of Chu&quot;.

<text>Rochechouart (, ; , earlier ) is a commune in the Haute-Vienne department, region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, west central France. It is a subprefecture of the department.

The name of the town comes from Latin &quot;roca cavardi&quot;, which roughly translates as the rock of Cavardus, the lord who had the fortified place built at the beginning of the 11th century. More often than not, natives pronounce it , not as is its pronunciation in Standard French.

==History==
Aymeric I, who lived around 990, was the first viscount and established the Rochechouartais dynasty. Aymeric IV took part in the First Crusade at the end of the 11th century at the side of Godfrey of Bouillon, and it was Aymeric VI (1170–1230) who built the present castle, the Château de Rochechouart, the keep and gatehouse of which remain standing.

At the end of the 13th century, Aimeric XI renounced a large part of his privileges and promulgated a charter of enfranchisement which transformed Rochechouart into a democratic city, and turned its inhabitants from slaves to the state into citizens. The city was from then on governed by four consuls who chose their own successors, without their lord&#x27;s intervention. At the same time the viscount suppressed all direct taxes such as the &quot;taille&quot; and the &quot;quête&quot; and abolished duties of service to the feudal lord. He also accorded the inhabitants of Rochechouart the essential conditions for total liberty – they could dispose of their goods, buy or sell, import and export whatever they wanted, build, move about freely within the viscountcy, all without intervention from their lord. This Charter was very advanced for its times, and despite pressure from the other lords in the region, it remained in force until 1789. François de Rochechouart in the late 15th century is known for his study on the &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Pierre Salmon, the secretary of Charles VI of France. Before the French Revolution, Rochechouart administratively depended on the Province of Poitou, the viscounts of Rochechouart being vassals of the Count of Poitiers, and religiously, it was under the control of the diocese of Limoges.

==Geography==
Rochechouart is situated at the confluence of the rivers Grêne and Vayres on the Plateau of Limousin, about above sea level. It is about south of Saint-Junien, the second largest town in the department of Haute-Vienne, and west of Limoges, the largest town and capital of the department. To the west lie the communes of Pressignac and Chassenon in the department of Charente, to the north lie the communes of Saillat-sur-Vienne and Chaillac-sur-Vienne, to the east lies Saint-Auvent and to the south Vayres.

The walled town of Rochechouart is overlooked by the château and houses a museum, the &quot;Espace Meteorite Paul Pellas&quot; which commemorates the meteorite crater. The château was taken over by the community in 1832 and now houses the town hall as well as a modern art collection, the &quot;Musée Départmental d&#x27;Art Contemporain&quot;.

==Rochechouart impact structure==

Rochechouart is situated in the Rochechouart impact structure, an impact crater caused by an asteroid that crashed into the Earth&#x27;s surface about 205 million years ago, in the Rhaetian period, shortly before the Triassic Jurassic boundary characterized by a massive extinction event in which 80% of the world&#x27;s species were obliterated.

==Population changes==

Inhabitants are known as &quot;Rochechouartais&quot;.

<text>Coleby is a village and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated on the A607, and approximately south of Lincoln.

==Village==
Coleby, is a documented settlement in &quot;Domesday&quot;, and in the Parts of Kesteven. Coleby is set on the Lincoln Cliff escarpment with views over the River Witham valley from its western side. The Viking Way, the long-distance footpath from the Humber Bridge to Oakham, passes through the village. Coleby&#x27;s population is approximately 600, falling to 410 at the 2011 census.

Coleby has one village public house, the Tempest Arms which stands at the top of the road that leads up the hill from the valley. The village has a small school typically consisting of below 100 pupils.

==Landmarks==
===Church of All Saints===
Coleby Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. The original church was built by the Anglo-Saxons. This was rebuilt by the Normans and extended, retaining the lower part of the Saxon tower and building upon it. The spire was added in the 15th century. There is a lack of symmetry to the chancel, the arches on the north and south walls do not match and half of an arch has been stopped off. The pews inside the church are not original, they come from a former church at Hackthorn, a village about to the north, as do two of the windows in the north aisle. The church was restored by F C Penrose in 1864 and the tower was restored in 1901. On the church steeple are landing lights for the nearby RAF Waddington airbase.

===Coleby Hall===
Coleby Hall is a Grade II* listed country house which stands near the church in a park of around . It is a gabled house constructed in coursed rubble and ashlar with a red-tiled ridge roof, built in 1628 for Sir William Lister of Rippingale, the father of Thomas Lister (1597–1668). The hall became the property of his nephew, William who was the father of Thomas Lister MP.

After the death of his father, William, the hall was inherited by Thomas Lister, MP (c.1658 – 8 February 1718) who was the great great-nephew of Sir William Lister of Rippingale, and he extended the hall by adding the eastern gable in 1687, On his death, it passed to his eldest daughter, Mary and thence in 1734 to her nephew, Thomas Scrope. Scrope altered and further extended the hall and in 1762 built in the grounds a folly of a Temple to Romulus and Remus (now grade I listed). In 1774 a gateway to the Hall was built as an imitation ruined Roman arch based on Newport Arch in Lincoln. Ownership passed to the Tempest family in 1856 who made major alterations to the hall and estate before selling it on. It was later bought by the Fowkes family, and apart from being requisitioned by the military during the Second World War, remained in their possession until 1981, when it was sold to property developers. In 2000 Coleby Hall consisted of subdivided separate dwellings, each having their own 20th century 20 garden. Currently, in 2023, it consists of a pleasure ground and woodland of 12 hectares surrounding the 17th- and 18th-century house. The stables and coach house both late 18th century buildings grade II listed buildings are also now private dwellings.

===RAF Coleby Grange===


During the Second World War, the Ministry of Defence constructed an airfield at RAF Coleby Grange to the east of the village on open heathland, immediately west of the A15 road. It opened in 1939 with grass runways as a relief landing ground for RAF Cranwell. In May 1941 it was transferred to 12 Group, RAF Fighter Command and became a satellite station for RAF Digby.
The station re-opened in 1959 as a Thor IRBM launching base, it closed again in 1963. Today the airfield is in private hands and used for agriculture with only the Control Tower, which still stands although in a ruined state, as a visible sign of the station&#x27;s existence.

<text>A balanced budget amendment or debt brake is a constitutional rule requiring that a state cannot spend more than its income. It requires a balance between the projected receipts and expenditures of the government.

Balanced-budget provisions have been added to the constitutions of Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, among others, as well as to the constitutions of most U.S. states. In the United States, the Republican Party has advocated for the introduction of a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.

Balanced budget amendments are defended with arguments that they reduce deficit spending and constrain politicians from making irresponsible short-term spending decisions when they are in office. Research shows that balanced budget amendments lead to greater fiscal discipline. However, there is substantial agreement among economists that &quot;strict annual&quot; balanced budget amendments have harmful near-term economic effects. In times of recession, deficit spending has significant benefits, whereas spending cuts by governments aggravate and lengthen recessions. To prevent that, most balanced-budget provisions make an exception for times of war, national emergency, or recession, or allow the legislature to suspend the rule by a supermajority vote.

==Europe==
===Austria===
In November 2011, the Austrian coalition government tried to amend its constitution and introduce a German style &quot;Schuldenbremse&quot; (&quot;debt brake&quot;). This would have forced the government to reduce its debt level to 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020. However, the government failed to gain a two-thirds majority in support of the constitutional amendment. Another attempt was made in October 2019, which was also unsuccessful.

===Denmark===
Local and regional authorities in Denmark are not allowed to run deficits and must always balance their budgets. There is no such rule for the national government, which has no limits on debt beyond the common rules of the European Union. Danish debt is very low in international comparison and stands at 33% of GDP in 2019.

===France===
Article 34 of the Constitution was amended in 2008 to include the objective of balancing the public sector accounts. In 2012, France passed a new law (2012–1403), creating the independent High Council of Public Finances, giving it the responsibility to report on the sustainability and deviation from planned targets of public spending.

===Germany===
In 2009, Germany&#x27;s constitution was amended to introduce the &quot;Schuldenbremse&quot; (&quot;debt brake&quot;), a balanced budget provision. This applies to both the federal government and the &quot;Länder&quot; (German states). From 2016 onwards, the federal government was forbidden to run a structural deficit of more than 0.35% of GDP. Since 2020, the states have not been permitted to run any structural deficit at all. The Basic Law permits an exception to be made for emergencies such as a natural disaster or severe economic crisis. The Federal government also used off-budget funds (&quot;Sondervermögen&quot;) to circumvent the brake rule. The debt brake has been criticized for low flexibility.

===Italy===
In 2011, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi promised to balance the budget by 2013, and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of Italy was added in 2012 with an overwhelming parliamentary majority, under the following Monti government. Under the amended Constitution, deficit spending can still take place in the event of emergencies, but only if authorized by a majority of the entire membership in both houses of Parliament. In practice, the term &quot;emergency&quot; has been loosely interpreted, and Parliament has always authorized the borrowing of new debt; Italy has not yet had a balanced budget since the passage of the amendment.

===Poland===
Poland&#x27;s constitution (adopted in 1997) caps the public debt at 60% of GDP – the government cannot take on any financial obligations that would cause that limit to be exceeded. To ensure this level is never breached, Poland has a self-imposed debt threshold of 55% of GDP, and the government must take action to balance the budget once this level is exceeded.

===Slovenia===
In 2013, the Slovenian parliament approved a balanced budget amendment to the constitution that came into force in 2015.

===Spain===
In 2011, the Spanish Parliament proposed a law amending the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The law states that public debt cannot exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession, or other emergencies. The changes will also require the government to stick to EU annual deficit limits of 3% of GDP.

===Sweden===
The Swedish government is obliged to run a budget surplus of at least 1% of GDP on average over a business cycle. In 2019, this goal was temporarily lowered to 0.33% of GDP. The overall debt must not be above 35% of GDP. This rule includes all levels of government, including local authorities.

===Switzerland===
After years of rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland&#x27;s citizens adopted the debt brake as a constitutional amendment in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions. This adjustment is made by multiplying expenditures by a cyclical factor (the ratio of trend real GDP to expected real GDP), thus either allowing for deficits during recessions or forcing lawmakers to have surpluses during booms. Essentially, the rule calls for structural balance in each year and absolute balance over the course of a business cycle. So if lawmakers want to have expansionary fiscal policy during recessions, they need to pay for it by saving up during good economic times. The rule did initially allow for &quot;extraordinary spending&quot; if a qualified parliamentary majority approved, but recent changes have made this spending count as normal expenditures.

==United States==
===U.S. states===
Every U.S. state other than Vermont has some form of balanced budget provision that applies to its operating budget. The precise form of this provision varies from state to state. Indiana has a state debt prohibition with an exception for &quot;temporary and casual deficits,&quot; but no balanced budget requirement. The governor is not legally required to submit a balanced budget, the legislature is not required to approve appropriations that are within available revenue, and the state is not required to end the year in balance. An unusual variant is the Oregon kicker, which bans &quot;surpluses&quot; of more than 2% of revenue by refunding the money to the taxpayers. State balanced budget requirements do not apply to state capital budgets, which generally allow states to use their debt capacity to finance long-term expenditures such as transportation and other infrastructure.

===U.S. federal government===
There is no balanced budget provision in the U.S. Constitution, so the federal government is not required to have a balanced budget and Congress usually does not pass one. Several proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution would require a balanced budget. Most of these proposed amendments allow a supermajority to waive the requirement of a balanced budget in times of war, national emergency, or recession.

====History====
The Articles of Confederation and the Perpetual Union had granted to the Continental Congress the power
: to borrow money, or emit bills on the credit of the United States, transmitting every half-year to the respective States an account of the sums of money so borrowed or emitted
And, with this as a model Article I, Section 8, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants to the United States Congress the power
: To borrow money on the credit of the United States;

At the time that the Constitution came into effect, the United States had a significant debt, primarily associated with the Revolutionary War. There were differences within and between the major political coalitions over the possible liquidation or increase of this debt. As early as 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote:I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government; I mean an additional article taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing. I now deny their power of making paper money or anything else a legal tender. I know that to pay all proper expenses within the year would, in a case of war, be hard on us. But not so hard as ten wars instead of one. For wars could be reduced in that proportion; besides that, the State governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas.
(Although Jefferson made a point of seeking a balanced budget during the early years of his administration, he seems to have later reversed himself in purchasing the Louisiana Territory. He made no exception for war, but rather saw the requirement of maintaining a balanced budget as a salutary deterrent.)

The issue of the federal debt was next addressed by the Constitution within Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment (proposed on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868):
: The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligation, and claims shall be held illegal and void.

One of the earliest Balanced Budget Amendment proposals presented in Congress was that of Senator Millard Tydings, who introduced Senate Joint Resolution 36, a resolution in support of a Constitutional Amendment that would have taken away some of the flexibility the U.S. Treasury had accrued with respect to debt management by proposing to prohibit appropriations in excess of revenues in the absence of a new debt authorization and require that any new debt be liquidated over a 15-year period.

On May 4, 1936, Representative Harold Knutson (R-Minnesota) introduced House Joint Resolution 579, resolution in support of a Constitutional Amendment that would have placed a &quot;per capita&quot; ceiling on the federal debt in peacetime.

Article V of the Constitution specifies that if the legislatures of two-thirds of the states apply to Congress for a constitutional amendment by means of an amendment-proposing convention, then Congress must call that convention. A total of 44 states have submitted applications for a balanced budget amendment, at some time in the past. However, they were not outstanding simultaneously as some have expired or been rescinded. As of 27 December 2016, there were 28 outstanding applications according to the Balance Budget Amendment Task Force which advocates for such an amendment. On 24 February 2017, Wyoming became the 29th state to call for a convention to pass a balanced budget amendment.

====Deficit spending====
Unlike the constitutions of most U.S. states, the United States Constitution does not require the United States Congress to pass a balanced budget, one in which the projected income to the government through taxes, fees, fines, and other revenues equals or exceeds the amount proposed to be spent. This has led to deficit spending and the creation of a national debt. Except for a short period during the presidency of Andrew Jackson since its inception the United States federal government has always been in debt.

Gross debt includes both public debt and Intragovernmental holdings—money borrowed from federal funds such as Medicare and Social Security.


====Nixon and Carter====
Deficit spending resumed under Richard Nixon, who had become president by the time that the 1969 surplus was known. Nixon&#x27;s advisors chose to fight inflation rather than to maintain a balanced budget. Nixon was famously quoted as saying, &quot;We are all Keynesians now,&quot; with regard to the budget deficit that his administration began to accumulate during years of mild recession. He also imposed the first peacetime wage and price controls, mandatory petroleum allotments, and many other features of a planned economy.

With the distractions of the Watergate scandal and the budget deficit relatively small, however, most criticisms were sidelined until the administration of Jimmy Carter. During Carter&#x27;s presidency, the term &quot;stagflation&quot; enjoyed widespread use as the economy stagnated even among increased inflation rates. This economic situation had been previously unheard of in the United States where increasing prices and wages had generally been seen during times of economic growth. Republicans began to make much mention of &quot;Democratic deficits&quot; and proposed the Balanced Budget Amendment as a cure.

During this time period, many liberal Democrats began to call for a Balanced Budget Amendment, including Governor Jerry Brown of California, who ran for president against Carter in 1980, and then-Congressman Paul Simon, who, upon his election to the U.S. Senate, would write the version of the amendment that came closest to passing.

====National Taxpayers Union and an Article V Convention====
The 1980 presidential election gave the presidency to Republican Ronald Reagan and control of the Senate to the Republicans. With President Reagan&#x27;s support, passage of the amendment started to seem more possible. On August 4, 1982, the United States Senate introduced and debated Joint Resolution 58, an Amendment to the United States Constitution requiring for each year&#x27;s Federal budget that &quot;total outlays are no greater than total receipts&quot; without three-fifths majority vote of both houses. Joint Resolution 58 passed in the Senate but was defeated in the House of Representatives, falling 46 votes short of the 2/3 majority needed. The amendment&#x27;s backers, far from despairing, said that it was needed more than ever. They began a plan to make an &quot;end run&quot; around Congress, for the U.S. Constitution also allows two-thirds of state legislatures to petition for a convention to be called for the purpose of writing proposed amendments to the Constitution, a procedure which has never happened under the Constitution; the Constitution itself was created by the original constitutional convention of 1787. Much of this effort was initially organized by the National Taxpayers Union and its president at the time, George Snyder, a former Majority Leader of the Maryland State Senate. Many people were appalled at the concept; some constitutional scholars suggested that such a body could not be limited to its ostensible purpose and could largely rewrite the Constitution, perhaps removing or reducing the Bill of Rights, a fear that backers described as being totally groundless, since any proposed changes would still have to be approved by three-quarters of the states, which would presumably doom any attempt to end basic constitutional freedoms.

Detractors also noted that there was no mechanism in place by which to select delegates to any such convention, meaning that the states might choose to select them in a way which tended to subvert democracy. Backers also produced their own constitutional scholars stating that limiting such a convention was perfectly constitutional, that it could be limited to whatever purpose the states had called it for, and that states would be free to select the delegates to represent them, as was the case in 1787.

====Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act====
Perhaps motivated by the number of state legislatures calling for such a convention approaching the required two-thirds, and recognizing its inability to make sufficient cuts on its own initiative to balance the budget, Congress responded in 1985 with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, named for its Senate sponsors, which called for automatic cuts in discretionary spending when certain deficit-reduction targets were not met. This act soon became a convenient target for opponents of all stripes, who blamed it for government failing to meet perceived needs, for not abolishing the deficit, and anything else that might be wrong with government. When it began to affect popular programs and was partially overturned in the courts, it was first amended to postpone the strength of its effects until later years, and then repealed in its entirety.

====George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot====
President George H. W. Bush, in part to help ensure Congressional support for the Gulf War, agreed to turn back on a campaign promise of no tax increases, reportedly in part because he saw disaffection from his conservative base due to the looming deficit. In his rhetoric to defend the idea of a balanced budget amendment, Bush likened the U.S. government to a household.

Deficit spending continued but was no longer much of an issue until the presidential bid of Ross Perot during the 1992 presidential election. Perot made the deficit, and his plans to eliminate it, the major issue of his campaign, along with his protectionist plans to reduce and then eliminate the trade deficit. Many supporters of the Balanced Budget Amendment flocked to the Perot camp. Despite winning a substantial number of popular votes, Perot failed to carry a single state (zero electoral votes). He eventually faded from the political scene and when appearances were made, focused more on the trade deficit issue.

====Newt Gingrich, Clinton and the budget surplus====
President Bill Clinton did not support a constitutional amendment, but in his 1992 campaign, he called for balancing the budget through ordinary fiscal policy. He came into office facing a large deficit. Clinton signed into law the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which attacked the deficit by raising taxes. Beginning with the 1998 budget year, during his second term, the federal government ran a yearly budget surplus through FY 2001. During the Clinton administration, there was an official surplus of $419 billion during fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.

However, it has been argued that this official balanced budget only constituted a surplus in the public debt (or &quot;on-budget&quot;), in which the Treasury Department borrowed increased tax revenue from intragovernmental debt (namely the Social Security Trust Fund), thus adding more interest on Treasury bonds. In effect, the four year alleged &#x27;surplus&#x27; was only in public debt holdings, while the National Debt Outstanding increased every fiscal year, the lowest being a $17.9 billion deficit in FY2000. Meanwhile, Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) such as GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC continued to borrow and spend an extra $543.6 billion over and above their previous 3 years. GSE debt instruments are classified as US Government Securities, but are not officially part of the Federal Debt total.

In 1995, the Republican-led Congress immediately engaged in a battle with President Clinton culminating in a vetoed budget and a brief shutdown of the Federal government. Despite negotiations disagreement remained on the pace of spending cuts. Ultimately Republican concessions differed little from what was attainable without shutdown. One provision of their &quot;Contract with America&quot; campaign document, the brainchild of Newt Gingrich who would later become Speaker of the House, called for a balanced-budget amendment. In 1995, such an amendment passed the House of Representatives and came within one vote of passing the Senate.

In his final State of the Union address, Clinton said the United States should continue to balance its books and pay off the debt.

====Deficits under George W. Bush and Barack Obama====
A recession, tax cuts and increases in military and other spending have eliminated late 1990s-era surpluses. Both the deficit and debt grew to the largest in U.S. history. In fiscal years starting September 30, 2002, and ending September 30, 2004, the deficit increased nearly 50%.

By 2008, the last full year of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, the deficit had almost doubled again, for the first time exceeding $1 trillion. As a result, during the administration of President George W. Bush, the &quot;gross debt&quot; increased from $5.7 trillion in January 2001 to $10.7 trillion by December 2008, rising from 57.0% of GDP to 74.5% of GDP.

By the end of 2008, a large reduction in tax revenues caused by the Great Recession and the cost of federal stimulus spending began contributing to a rapidly increasing deficit. Responses to the crisis from both the Bush administration—the bank bailouts and economic stimulus of late 2008—and more stimulus spending in the first months of the Obama administration grew the deficit further. By the end of 2009, the national debt reached a record $11.9 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in March 2009 that under the Obama administration &quot;public debt&quot; would rise from 40.8% of GDP in 2008 to 70.1% in 2012. &quot;Gross debt&quot; did rise to 84.5% of GDP at the end of Fiscal Year 2009 and to 93.5% of GDP at the end of the fiscal year 2010. (Gross debt includes both public debt and intragovernmental holdings – money borrowed from federal funds such as Medicare and Social Security.)

During the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis, some Republicans supported a bill that would avert the crisis by raising the debt ceiling, but with an increase that would not take effect until a balanced-budget amendment was approved by both houses of Congress and submitted to the states. In addition to balancing the budget, it would also impose a constitutional limit on federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product and would set a supermajority requirement on tax increases. The Budget Control Act of 2011, which resolved the debt-ceiling crisis, required Congress to vote on a balanced-budget amendment in the near future. In addition, it stated that once a balanced budget amendment was sent to the states, the debt ceiling would be automatically increased by 1.5 trillion (this would be in addition to the initial debt limit increase of 2.1 trillion (from 14.294 to 16.394 trillion)).

On November 18, 2011, the House of Representatives voted down a balanced-budget amendment that would not have imposed a supermajority requirement on tax increases. House Rules Committee chair David Dreier (R-CA), who had voted for the amendment in 1995, announced that he had changed his mind about the need to amend the Constitution, in light of the success in balancing the budget in the late 1990s.

====Impact====
There is substantial agreement among economists that a strict balanced budget amendment would have adverse effects. In times of recession, deficit spending has significant benefits, whereas spending cuts by governments aggravate and lengthen recessions. In 2003, approximately 90% of the members of the American Economic Association agreed with the statement, &quot;If the federal budget is to be balanced, it should be done over the course of the business cycle, rather than yearly.&quot; Weighted by confidence, 99% of U.S. economists surveyed by IGM in 2017 agreed that a balanced budget amendment would not reduce economic output variability in the United States, and 53% agreed that it would not substantially decrease the borrowing costs of the federal government.

Economist and public choice scholar James Buchanan was a prominent advocate for a balanced budget amendment. In U.S. politics, Republicans tend to advocate for balanced budget amendments, whereas Democrats oppose them. Lobbying organizations supporting the balanced budget amendment include: Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and Citizens for Self-Governance. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities has argued that constitutional balanced budget amendment would pose serious risks.

The amendment has been called &quot;political posturing&quot; because its proponents use it to position themselves as supporters of a balanced budget but without specifying which unpopular tax increases or spending cuts they would support to reach that goal. For example, Robert Bixby of the anti-deficit Concord Coalition called the amendment &quot;an avoidance device.&quot; Economist Dean Baker has noted that if the federal government were to run budget surpluses with the US still experiencing a large trade deficit, the economy would, in the absence of economic bubbles, shrink and experience rising unemployment. Without significant devaluation of the US dollar, he has stated, the federal government necessarily has to run budget deficits to offset trade deficits or there will be high unemployment.

It has been argued that such amendment would likely be unenforceable. Among other reasons, the standard budgetary process in the United States operates with &quot;projected&quot; figures. There is no way of knowing ahead of time whether the budget would end up unbalanced in any fiscal year before that fiscal year is over. While the Congress may be mandated by the amendment only to pass balanced budgets, this could be easily circumvented by inflating revenue projections or routing spending through off-budget channels. Balanced-budget amendment proposals often contain an exemption for emergencies such as being in the state of war. It could be envisioned that the Congress would simply declare the country in a perpetual state of war, year after year, just to avoid the necessity of politically costly spending cuts or tax increases.

==Asia==
===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates that the government must keep “the expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget” and “avoid deficits”. Debt to GDP in Hong Kong was 42.4% in 2019.

<text>Fat Pizza (simply known as Pizza, titled Fat Pizza: Back in Business from season six onwards) is an Australian comedy television series created by Paul Fenech. 

The series premiered on SBS on 24 April 2000 where it aired for its first five seasons between 2000 and 2007 before moving to 7mate for its sixth and seventh seasons, in 2019 and 2021, respectively. The series has a spin-off feature length film, &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;, released in 2003, and a best-of highlights video and DVD that featured previously unreleased footage and a schoolies exposé, released in 2004. In addition to this, a theatre show entitled &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;, starring several characters from the show, toured the Australian east coast. In 2014, the storyline of the series was combined with that of &quot;Housos&quot; to create the motion picture &quot;Fat Pizza vs. Housos&quot;. The film was shown in Australian cinemas from 27 November 2014.

Through some ironic and self-conscious references, &quot;Pizza&quot; involves themes of ethnicity and stereotypes (similar to &quot;Acropolis Now&quot;), cars, sex, illicit drugs and violence to produce its dark humour. The television program is noted for its frequent cameo appearances of numerous Australian celebrities of all varieties, including actors, comedians, professional athletes and other public figures.

==History and development==
&quot;Pizza&quot; began in the early 1990s as a black-and-white short film entitled &quot;Pizza Man&quot; created by Paul Fenech, in which he starred as the eponymous pizza man. In 1995, the short film won third place in the Tropfest film festival. 

The subsequent television series &quot;Pizza&quot; was written and directed by Paul Fenech, who portrays the protagonist of the series, pizza deliveryman Pauly. In a few of the episodes, Pauly breaks the fourth wall and as Paul Fenech, the self-described &quot;fil-um maker&quot;,[sic] presents featurettes that reveal the history of the series, often in a tongue-in-cheek or parody manner. It was first broadcast on the SBS network in 2000 until the fifth season in 2007. The half-hour program was part of the SBS Monday comedy slot, noted for its offbeat comedy shows including &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;John Safran&quot;.

The &quot;Fat Pizza&quot; feature film was released in 2003 and the second &quot;Fat Pizza vs. Housos&quot; in 2014, also featured characters from another Paul Fenech comedy series &quot;Housos&quot;. 

Season 4 saw the shop move locations from Greenacre to Station Street, Fairfield Heights, NSW. This season also coincided with the addition of new cast members to the main Fat Pizza crew. The start of season 5 once again saw the store move locations, this time to a small shopping complex situated on Canberra Street, St Johns Park, NSW where it remained till the end of the series before its subsequent reboot of the series in 2019 which began season 6.

In August 2019, it was announced the series would be returning for a new season on Seven Network&#x27;s multichannel 7mate, titled Fat Pizza: Back In Business. The season premiered on 5 November 2019. On 29 January 2020, it was announced that &quot;Fat Pizza: Back in Business&quot; had been renewed for another season. The season renewal was officially confirmed at Seven&#x27;s Upfronts in October 2020, and premiered on 8 September 2021.

==Synopsis==
The show focuses on the activities of Pauly and his fellow co-workers, as they deliver pizzas for &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;, the Sydney-based pizzeria of Bobo Gigliotti, whose slogan is &quot;they&#x27;re big and they&#x27;re cheesy&quot;.

Throughout the series, the dangers of pizza delivery are exemplified by encounters with aliens, killer kangaroos, bikies, bogans, petty criminals, muggers, drug dealers, addicts and/or cartels, dominatrices, celebrities, the CIA, ASIO, Australian Border Force, the Australian Taxation Office, the New South Wales Police Force, the National Rugby League, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Army, Arab and Asian terrorists, organised crime gangs and even evil Satanic forces that conspire to bring about the end of the world. In spite of this, the characters remain unfazed and unsurprised, and they persist in their dead-end, below-minimum-wage job, which pays A$2.00 per hour.

In Season 1, the internal and external shots of the Fat Pizza restaurant were filmed at 322 Pacific Highway, Lane Cove. The restaurant used for filming in Seasons 2 and 3, as well as the &quot;Fat Pizza&quot; movie and live shows, was at 67 Hume Highway, Chullora. The Chullora and Lane Cove shops had actually operated as pizzerias; the Lane Cove shop still operated until 2016 (Now demolished and rebuilt as apartments) and the Chullora shop operated as a pizzeria between 2000 and 2009, but as of 2013 it had been sold and the interior stripped completely. It was re-opened as &quot;Kyoja Dumpling&quot; a Vietnamese dumpling take away shop but was not profitable and by 2017 the shop was empty once again. In 2006 parts of the series were filmed at the Babel Restaurant in Fairfield Heights before moving to St Johns Park in 2007.

Some episodes were also in other parts of Australia. The cast also went to Bangkok, Thailand, Mumbai, India, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Los Angeles, United States, Las Vegas, United States, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Rome, Italy, Naples, Italy, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Malta and Paris, France.

<doc id="1137859" wikidata="Q5032417" url="?curid=1137859" title="Canine terminology">
<text>Canine terminology in this article refers only to &quot;dog terminology&quot;, specialized terms describing the characteristics of various external parts of the domestic dog, as well as terms for structure, movement, and temperament. This terminology is not typically used for any of the wild species or subspecies of wild wolves, foxes, coyotes, dholes, jackals or the basal caninae. Dog terminology is often specific to each breed or type of dog. Breed standards use this terminology in the description of the ideal external appearance of each breed, although similar characteristics may be described with different terms in different breeds.

==Dog coats==

Coat colors range from pure white to solid black and many other variations. Above is a white American Eskimo dog and a black Belgian Shepherd (Groenendael). 


A Stanford University School of Medicine study published in Science in October, 2007 found the genetics that explain coat colors in other mammals such as in horse coats and in cat coats, did not apply to dogs. The project took samples from 38 different breeds to find the gene (a beta defensin gene) responsible for dog coat color. One version produces yellow dogs, and a mutation produces black. All dog coat colors are modifications of black or yellow. For example, the white in white miniature schnauzers is a cream color, not albinism (a genotype of e/e at MC1R.)

Today, dogs exhibit a diverse array of fur coats, including dogs without fur, such as the Mexican Hairless Dog. Dog coats vary in texture, color, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has evolved to describe each characteristic.

===Color===
One often refers to a specific dog first by coat color rather than by breed; for example, &quot;a blue merle Aussie&quot; or &quot;a chocolate Lab&quot;. Coat colors include:

*Black
*Brown: From mahogany through liver (dark brown).
*Red: Reminiscent of reddish woods such as cherry or mahogany; also tawny, chestnut, orange, rusty, and red-gold.
*Yellow: From pale cream to a deep yellowish-gold tan.
*Gold: From pale apricot to rich reddish-yellow.
*Gray: Pale to dark gray, including silver; can be mixed with other colors or various shades to create &quot;sandy pepper&quot;, &quot;pepper&quot;, &quot;grizzle&quot;, &quot;blue-black gray&quot;, or &quot;silver-fawn&quot;.
*Blue: A dark metallic gray, otherwise known as slate; diluted black pigment. Blue merle is genetically black, not blue.
*Sable: Black-tipped hairs; the background color can be gold, silver, gray, or tan.
*White: Distinct from albino dogs.
*Buff: Such as the buff Cocker spaniel.

All these colors can also be &quot;dilute&quot;, meaning they become a paler shade of the original color. Blue and cream are both dilute colors.

===Pattern===

Coat patterns include:
*Bicolor: such as black and tan, red and white. The coat has both colors but in clearly defined and separated areas; usually the top and sides are darker and lower legs and underside are the lighter color.
*Tricolor: Consisting of three colors, usually black, tan, and white or liver, tan, and white.
*Brindle: A mixture of black with brown, tan, or gold, usually in a &quot;tiger stripe&quot; pattern. Sometimes called grizzle when the pattern is not in lines.
*Roan: A kind of ticking on the hair where half the fur is one color and the other half is a different color. In English Setters, this color pattern is called a &quot;Belton&quot; pattern.
*Harlequin: &quot;Torn&quot; patches of black on white.
*Merle: Marbled coat with darker patches and spots of the specified color.
*Particolor: Two-colored coat with the colors appearing in patches in roughly equal quantities.
*Tuxedo: Solid (usually black) with a white patch (shirt front) on the chest, and white on some or all of the feet (spats.) This pattern is sometimes called Irish Spotting, Flashy, or Boston.
*Blenheim: A red and white pattern found in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
*Domino: A specific facial and body pattern in Afghan Hounds caused by a certain genotype.

===Texture===
Coat textures vary tremendously. Some coats make the dogs more cuddly and others make them impervious to cold water. Densely furred breeds such as most sled dogs and Spitz types can have up to 600 hairs per inch, while fine-haired breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier can have as few as 100, and the &quot;hairless&quot; breeds such as the Mexican Hairless Dog and the Peruvian Inca Orchid have none on parts of their bodies. The texture of the coat often depends on the distribution and the length of the two parts of a dog&#x27;s coat, its thick, warm &quot;undercoat&quot; (or &quot;down&quot;) and its rougher, somewhat weather-resistant outer coat (&quot;topcoat&quot;, also referred to as &quot;guard hairs&quot;). Breeds with soft coats often have more or longer undercoat hairs than guard hairs; rough-textured coats often have more or longer guard hairs. Textures include:
*Double-coated: Having a thick, warm, short &quot;undercoat&quot; (or &quot;down&quot;) that is usually dense enough to resist penetration by water and a stronger, rougher weather-resistant outer coat (&quot;topcoat&quot;), also referred to as &quot;guard hairs&quot;. Most other coat types are also double-coated.
*Single-coated: Lacking an undercoat.
*Smooth-coated: &quot;Smooth&quot; to the eye and touch.
*Wire-haired: Also called &quot;broken-coated&quot;. The harsh outer guard hairs are prominent, providing excellent weather protection for hunting dogs such as the Border Terrier or Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.
*Long-haired: Hair longer than an inch or so.
*Short-haired: Hair around an inch or so long.
*Corded coat: for example, see Puli

==Parts of the body==
A special vocabulary has been developed to describe the characteristics of various body parts of the dog. Terms are often specific to each breed or type of dog.

===Head===
The parts of the head are the nose, muzzle, stop, forehead or braincase, occiput (highest point of the skull at the back of the head), ears, eyes, eyebrows or brows, whiskers, flews (lips, which may hang down), and cheeks.

Dog heads are of three basic shapes:
*Apple-headed refers to a dog&#x27;s head that is round on top, not flat.
*Brachycephalic, or shortened muzzled, sometimes so short that it can lead to breathing problems, such as in the Pug.
*Dish-faced refers to a dog whose nasal bone is higher at the nose than at the stop.
*Dolichocephalic, or long and narrow, as seen in most &quot;hounds&quot; like a Borzoi or other breeds such as the Rough Collie and the grey wolf.
*Down-faced, a convex facial structure where the muzzle is turned slightly downward when looked at from the dogs profile, such as a Bull Terrier.
*Mesocephalic, or wedge shaped (broad skull with a narrower muzzle).

====Nose====
*Butterfly nose is of two colors.
*Dudley nose is a flesh-colored nose.

====Muzzle====
A snipey muzzle is one that is too pointed for good breed type.

====Stop====
The stop is the degree of angle change between the skull and the nasal bone near the eyes. Also the indentation between the eyes where the nose and skull meet.

====Forehead or braincase====
====Occiput====
The occiput in dog terms is the bump or protuberance clearly seen at the back of the skull in some breeds like the English Setter and Bloodhound. However, in other breeds it is barely perceptible. Myths in dog folklore believed that size of the occipital protuberance was somehow a measure of the dog&#x27;s sense of smell. So to this day it is prominent in most Scent Hounds.
However, technically the occipital bone extends right down the back of the head to where it articulates with the neck. So when breed standards refer to the length of a dog&#x27;s skull, they rarely include the occiput in this measurement.
The occiput has many nerve endings and stimulates calming effects to do with the flight or fight system. It is used in canine therapeutic massage to calm the dogs.

====Ears====

Dogs&#x27; ears come in a variety of sizes, shapes, lengths, positions on the head, and amounts and types of droop. Every variation has a term, including:
*Bat ear: Erect, broad next to the head and rounded at the tip, such as the ears on a Chihuahua or a French Bulldog.
*Button ear: A smaller ear where the tip folds forward nearly to the skull, forming a V, as in the Jack Russell Terrier.
*Cropped ear: Shaped by cutting; see cropping.
*Drop ear: An ear that folds and droops close to the head, such as the little known Blue Lacy. Also called a &quot;pendant&quot; ear.
*Natural: Like a wolf&#x27;s.
*Prick ear: Erect and pointed; also called &quot;pricked&quot; or &quot;erect&quot;.
*Rose ear: A very small drop ear that folds back; as in the greyhound or bulldog.
*Semiprick ear: A prick ear where the tip just begins to fold forward, as in the Rough Collie.
*Hound ear: Floppy ear that is long and droopy enough to collect air around the nostrils, as in scent hounds and spaniels.

====Eyes====
A dog&#x27;s vision is actually equivalent to a human with red-green color blindness. Different breeds have different shapes of eyes. It all depends on the purpose. If a dog is a hunter, they most definitely need good eyesight. Therefore, those breeds have a wider range of vision than others. As a rule of thumb, breeds with short heads have a narrower field of vision, whereas breeds with longer heads have a wider field of vision - such as wolf, sighthound.

====Eyebrows or brows====

Eyebrows not necessarily noticeable just normal defined brow line above the eyes.

====Whiskers====
Whiskers tend to be similar like most breeds of Pitbull/Terrier dogs. Medium to long whiskers, wispy but coarse feeling to the touch.

====Flews====
Flews are a dog&#x27;s upper lips, or the canine equivalent of upper lips.

====Mouth and teeth====
The bite describes how the dog&#x27;s teeth meet when the mouth is closed.
Usually have wide mouths and good teeth, these breeds can benefit from getting their teeth brushed regularly due to such wide areas in their mouths.

===Body===
The body may be described as &quot;cobby&quot; (short and square) or sometimes by a ratio of height to length.

===Withers===
The ridge between the shoulder blades; often it is the tallest point of the body.

===Skin===

The skin for this specific breed is normal but can get itchy at times, these dogs need regular bathing at least every month or two.

===Legs and gait===

====Legs====

Strong but lean muscular build in the arms and legs. Broad build at the top of the leg and slims by the feet and ankle area.

====Gait====

*Single suspension gallop: The dog supports its weight with its feet in the unsymmetrical sequence RF, LF, RH, LH.
*Double suspension gallop: The front legs are in full extension forward while the rear legs are in full extension rearward.

===Feet===
One way a dog releases heat from its body is from in between its paws.
Some dogs have a seemingly superfluous claw at the base of their foot. This is known as a dewclaw.

===Tails===

Like ears, tails come in a tremendous variety of shapes, lengths, amounts of fur, and tailsets (positions). Among them:
*Bob: Short or non-existent tail, such as an Australian Shepherd or Pembroke Welsh Corgi.
*Corkscrew: Short and twisted, such as a Pug&#x27;s
*Docked: Shortened by surgery or other method, usually two or three days after birth; see docking
*Odd: Twisted, but not short. Uncommon. Tibetan Terriers have odd tails.
*Saber: Carried in a slight curve like a saber
*Sickle: Carried out and up in a semicircle like a sickle
*Squirrel: Carried high and towards the head, often with the tip curving even further towards the head.
*Wheel: Carried up and over the back in a broad curve, resembling a wheel.

<text>Donald Bernard Schwall (born March 2, 1936) is an American former professional baseball pitcher player who played seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Initially drafted by the Boston Red Sox, he spent four seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates, before ending his career with the Atlanta Braves.

==Baseball career==
Schwall was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He attended Ypsilanti High School and was selected an All-Big Eight basketball star at the University of Oklahoma in 1957. Schwall faced off against NBA Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain three times while playing for the Sooners, outscoring him 30-16 in his final showdown against him. Although he completed his coursework, a clerical error caused Schwall to never receive his degree. The oversight went unnoticed for decades until 2018 when at the age of 82, Schwall contacted the University of Oklahoma about it. The university acknowledged the oversight and had Schwall attend that year&#x27;s graduation, 57 years late. A year after leaving college, he signed with the Red Sox.

In 1961, Schwall posted a 15–7 record with 91 strikeouts and a 3.22 earned run average, for a Boston team that finished 33 games out of first place and ten games under .500. He won his first six decisions, extended the dazzling first-year stats to 13–2, and won Rookie of the Year honors, beating out Hall of Fame-bound teammate Carl Yastrzemski. Schwall was the second Red Sox player to be named the AL Rookie of the Year, joining Walter Dropo (1950), and later joined by Carlton Fisk (1972), Fred Lynn (1975), Nomar Garciaparra (1997), and Dustin Pedroia (2007). At Fenway Park, on July 31, he pitched three innings in the first All-Star Game tie in major league baseball history (1–1), occurred when the game was stopped in the 9th inning due to rain.

After a sub-par 1962 season (9–15), Schwall was sent to Pittsburgh. He and catcher Jim Pagliaroni were traded to the Pirates for first baseman Dick Stuart and pitcher Jack Lamabe. He went 6–12 in 1963, and later switched to a reliever, recording a career-best 2.92 ERA while winning nine games in 1965. The Pirates traded him to the Braves on June 15, 1966 for left-handed pitcher Billy O&#x27;Dell. Schwall finished his career with Atlanta early in the next season.

In seven seasons, Schwall compiled a 49–48 record with 408 strikeouts, a 3.72 ERA, 18 complete games, five shutouts, four saves, and 743 innings pitched in 172 games (103 as a starter).

==Post-baseball career==
After leaving baseball, Schwall pursued a career as an investment banker. A friend of Bob Prince, Schwall managed Prince&#x27;s charitable endeavors in the years after his death. Schwall continued to pursue his college education after becoming a professional baseball player, but never received his degree. In early 2018, he contacted the University of Oklahoma and was informed that he had completed his graduation requirements in 1961. He attended the school&#x27;s May 2018 graduation ceremonies and received his diploma.

<text>Grecia Dolores Colmenares Mieussens (; born 7 December 1962) is a Venezuelan actress.

== Biography ==
Grecia Dolores Colmenares Mieussens was born on 7 December 1962, in Valencia, Venezuela. She is the daughter of a Venezuelan father and a French mother. She pursued her education at school Lisandro Ramírez and at the Liceo Malpica. She studied theater with the director and playwright Miguel Torrence.

== Personal life ==
In 1978, she met Henry Zakka on recordings of &quot;Drama de amor en el Bloque 6&quot;. In 1979, when Grecia was 17 years old, she married the actor, Henry Zakka. The couple divorced in 1983.

In 1986, a few months after arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina, she met the Argentine businessman Marcelo Pelegri. In 1986, she married Marcelo Pelegri. On 4 September 1992, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a boy. The couple divorced in 2005.

Grecia Colmenares has obtained Argentine citizenship.

== Career ==
Grecia Colmenares became a sensation as a young actress in her native Venezuela during the 1970s, becoming a favorite of the general public in that country. She made her debut, as an eleven-year-old, in the &quot;Angelica&quot; Spanish soap opera. She continued participating in other soap operas through her teenage years, including the major hits &quot;Estefanía&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Elizabeth&quot; in 1980. Those major hits were followed by a number of lesser known soap operas, as well as other hits, such as 1981&#x27;s &quot;Marielena&quot; and, in 1984, &quot;Azucena&quot; and &quot;Topacio&quot;. In 1991, she starred in the famous soap opera , which obtained a huge success worldwide, and Colmenares won several prizes for her outstanding job as Isabel and Manuela. 

Although her jobs in Venezuela gave her considerable international fame, it was after she moved to Argentina that Colmenares became paparazzi fodder. Colmenares then became a household name across Latin America. She appeared frequently on the covers of gossip and fashion magazines, and rumors of a rivalry with Andrea Del Boca surfaced, although these rumors lasted for a short period only. In 1999, Colmenares acted in a telenovela that Del Boca had previously participated in: &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, which had by then become a major international hit. In 2001, she was seen in Miami, Florida, trying to get a contract with Univision. Nevertheless, she was not able to get contracted by that network. In Venezuela, Colmenares and Victor Camara formed a popular on-camera couple, starring together in a number of soap operas.

<doc id="1137867" wikidata="Q5638700" url="?curid=1137867" title="Haggetts Pond">
<text>Haggetts Pond is the reservoir for the town of Andover, Massachusetts, United States. It is located in the western part of the town and also lends its name to a road. The Merrimack River is connected to the pond to add volume to the reservoir.

It is bordered by Route 133 on the south. Not far to the northwest is Interstate 495; to the northeast is Interstate 93.
Permissible activities include walking, hiking, jogging biking and fishing. Only registered rowboats are allowed on the reservoir and fishing must be done from either the shoreline or a rowboat (no hip waders). Canoeing or kayaking, windsurfing, sailing, ice skating and ice fishing are prohibited. Swimming, bathing, wading and pets in the water are also prohibited.

Hiking trails, some converted out of a former railway (the Lowell and Lawrence Railroad), encircle the pond.

The Pond also gives its name to a road (Haggetts Pond Road) that starts to the west of the pond itself. Haggetts Pond Road transverses Route 133, but the vast majority of its length is on the side north of the pond. (Of the 245 houses on Haggetts Pond Road, 240 of them are on the north side.)

<text>The International Standard Music Number or ISMN (ISO 10957) is a thirteen-character alphanumeric identifier for printed music developed by ISO.

==Overview==
The original proposal for an ISMN was made by the UK Branch of IAML (International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres), put forward by Alan Pope (Blackwell&#x27;s Music Department, Oxford), Malcolm Lewis (music librarian in Nottingham) and Malcolm Jones (music librarian in Birmingham). A draft ISMN structure and application was presented at the 1987 IAML conference in Amsterdam, then after further discussions at the 1989 IAML conference in Oxford it was decided that the UK, French and German branches should, through their respective national standards bodies (BSI, AFNOR and DIN) file ISMN as an ISO work project. After meetings in Ottawa and Paris in 1993, the draft was finalized and published by ISO.

The original format comprised four elements: a distinguishing prefix M, a publisher ID, an item ID, and a check digit, typically looking like M-2306-7118-7. From 1 January 2008, the ISMN was defined as a thirteen digit identifier beginning 979-0 where the zero replaced M in the old-style number. The resulting number is identical with its EAN-13 number as encoded in the item&#x27;s barcode. The 979 Unique Country Code prefix is known as &quot;Musicland&quot;.

The current format comprises four blocks: the prefix &quot;979-0&quot; reserved for ISMNs — at some future date they are expected to occupy the remainder of the 979 space which is shared with ISBNs, a block to identify the publisher, another to identify the item and one final check digit. The TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for the standard.

A publication may be assigned both an ISBN and an ISMN. Unlike the ISBN, the ISMN does not segregate publishers by country.

==Check digit==

The check digit is calculated in the same way as an ISBN-13, and in turn, an EAN-13. Specifically, each digit of the ISMN is multiplied by a weight, alternating 1 and 3 left to right. These weighted digits are added together. The check digit is the integer between 0 and 9 that makes the sum a multiple of 10.

The check digit for a pre-2008 code, M-xxxx-xxxx-c is computed in the same manner as the EAN check digit for the 13-digit code obtained by replacing M with 9790. In other words, the old and new codes differ only by the replacement of M with 9790, with no change in the check digit. This differs from, for example, the ISBN to EAN mapping where the check digit must be recalculated. 

===Examples===
For instance, for the item with ISMN beginning 979-0-060-11561:
: 1×9 + 3×7 + 1×9 + 3×0 + 1×0 + 3×6 + 1×0 + 3×1 + 1×1 + 3×5 + 1×6 + 3×1 
: = 9 + 21 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 18 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 
: = 85
As 85 mod 10 = 5, the check digit is 10 − 5 = 5 and the full number is 979-0-060-11561-5.

For another example, Robert Fripp&#x27;s collection of Guitar Craft scores has the ISMN 979-0-9016791-7-7. Given first 12 digits 979-0-9016791-7, the ISMN algorithm evaluates 
: 1×9 + 3×7 + 1×9 + 3×0 + 1×9 + 3×0 + 1×1 + 3×1 + 1×6 + 3×7 + 1×9 + 3×1 
: = 9 + 21 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 21 + 9 + 3 
: = 123
which implies that the check digit is indeed 7 (because 123+7=130=13×10).

<text>Diplodocids, or members of the family Diplodocidae (&quot;double beams&quot;), are a group of sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the Earth, including &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, some of which may have reached lengths of up to .

==Description==

Diplodocids were generally large animals, even by sauropod standards. Thanks to their long necks and tails, diplodocids were among the longest sauropods, with some species such as &quot;Supersaurus vivianae&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus hallorum&quot; estimated to have reached lengths of or more. The heaviest diplodocids, such as &quot;Supersaurus&quot; and &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, may have weighed close to 40 tonnes. However, not all diplodocids were so large; the South American species &quot;Leinkupal laticauda&quot; was one of the smallest diplodocids, with an estimated length of only .

Their heads, like those of other sauropods, were tiny with the nasal openings on the top of the head (though in life the nostrils themselves would have been close to the tip of the snout).

The heads of diplodocids have been widely depicted with the nostrils on top due to the position of the nasal openings at the apex of the skull. There has been speculation over whether such a configuration meant that diplodocids may have had a trunk. A 2006 study surmised there was no paleoneuroanatomical evidence for a trunk. It noted that the facial nerve in an animal with a trunk, such as an elephant, is large as it innervates the trunk. The evidence suggests that the facial nerve is very small in diplodocids. Studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) indicated that, while the nasal openings were high on the head, the actual, fleshy nostrils were situated much lower down on the snout.

Diplodocids had long necks, which could reach an estimated length of in the largest, longest-necked species. The neck was typically composed of 15 vertebrae, though in &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, the neck probably had 16 vertebrae as the result of the incorporation of an additional vertebra from the dorsal series. The habitual neck posture of diplodocids is controversial; studies have proposed postures ranging from nearly straight and below horizontal to an S-curve that reaches vertical.

=== Distinguishing anatomical features===

A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies - distinctive anatomical features that are unique to a given organism or group.

The clade Diplodocidae is distinguished based on the following characteristics:
* nares: the external nares face dorsally; and the internarial bar is absent
* jugal: the jugal forms a substantial part of the caudoventral margin of the antorbital fenestra
* quadratojugal processes: the angle between the rostral quadratojugal process and the dorsal quadratojugal process is approximately 130°
* paroccipital process: the distal end of the paroccipital process is rounded and tongue-like in shape
* parasphenoid: the parasphenoid rostrum is a laterally compressed, thin spike and is lacking the longitudinal dorsal groove
* pterygoid: the ectopterygoid process of the pterygoid is located below the antorbital fenestra, and is reduced, such that it is not visible below the ventral margin of the skull when examined in lateral view; also the breadth of the main body of the pterygoid at least 33% of the length of the pterygoid
* teeth: at least 5-6 replacement teeth occur per alveolus (as observed in &quot;Nigersaurus&quot;)
* dorsal vertebrae: no more than 10 dorsal vertebrae are present
* caudal vertebrae: 70-80 caudal vertebrae are present
* pedal phalanges: pedal phalanx I-1 has a proximoventral margin drawn out into a thin plate or heel that underlies the distal end of metatarsal I; also pedal phalanx II-2 is reduced in craniocaudal length and has an irregular shape

===Skin===

Few skin impressions of diplodocids have been found. However, at least one significant find was reported by Stephen Czerkas in 1992. Fossils from the Howe Quarry in Shell, Wyoming preserved portions of the skin from around the tip of the tail, or &quot;whiplash&quot;. Czerkas noted that the skin preserved a sequence of conical spines, and that other, larger spines were found scattered around larger tail vertebrae. The spines appeared to be oriented in a single row along the mid-line of the tail, and Czerkas speculated that this midline row may have continued over the animal&#x27;s entire back and neck.

Skin fossils have been discovered at the Mother&#x27;s Day Quarry that have been assigned to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; sp. These skin fossils exhibit a vast amount of scale diversity, the scales of which vary in shape, size, orientation, and 3-dimensional relief depending on their location on the integument. Some of the scale orientations may indicate where the skin originated on the body. For instance, a scale orientation consisting of arching rows of square scales is noted to look similar to scale orientations seen around crocodilian limbs, so it is hypothesized that this area may have come from around a limb in life. Due to the high diversity of scales seen on a relatively small area of skin, the small size of the scales, and the presence of small and juvenile individuals at the Mother&#x27;s Day Quarry, it is hypothesized that the skin originated from a small or juvenile individual.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet and feeding===
Their teeth were only present in the front of the mouth, and looked like pencils or pegs. They probably used their teeth to crop off food, without chewing, and relied on gastroliths (gizzard stones) to break down tough plant fibers (similar to modern birds).
Diplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both the upper and lower teeth. 

This implies that the feeding mechanism of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and other diplodocids was radically different from that of other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.

Young &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) used biomechanical modelling to examine the performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D&#x27;Emic &quot;et al.&quot; Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.

===Growth===
Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Griebeler et al. (2013) examined long bone histological data and concluded that the diplodocid MfN.R.2625 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 23 years and died at age 24. The same growth model indicated that the diplodocid MfN.R.NW4 weighed , and died at age 23, before reaching sexual maturity.

===Paleopathology=== 
An unnamed diplodocid specimen from the Morrison Formation nicknamed &quot;Dolly&quot; shows evidence of a throat infection that created cauliflowered bone in the vertebral air sacs. The infection is theorized to have been similar to aspergillosis, though research is ongoing. Whether or not the infection contributed to the dinosaur&#x27;s death remains unknown.

===Tail function===

Diplodocids also had long, whip-like tails, which were thick at the base and tapered off to be very thin at the end. Computer simulations have shown that the diplodocids could have easily snapped their tails, like a bullwhip. This could generate a sonic boom in excess of 200 decibels, and may have been used in mating displays, or to drive off predators. There is some circumstantial evidence supporting this as well: a number of diplodocids have been found with fused or damaged tail vertebrae, which may be a symptom of cracking their tails: these are particularly common between the 18th and the 25th caudal vertebra, a region the authors consider a transitional zone between the stiff muscular base and the flexible whiplike section. However, Rega (2012) notes that &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, while lacking a tailwhip, displays a similar level of caudal co-ossification, and that &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;, while having the same pattern of vertebral metrics, lacks a tailwhip and doesn&#x27;t display fusion in any &quot;transitional region&quot;. Also, the crush fractures which would be expected if the tail was used as a whip have never been found in diplodocids. More recently, Baron (2020) considers the use of the tail as a bullwhip unlikely because of the potentially catastrophic muscle and skeletal damage such speeds could cause on the large and heavy tail. Instead, he proposes that the tails might have been used as a tactile organ to keep in touch with the individuals behind and on the sides in a group while migrating, which could have augmented cohesion and allowed communication among individuals while limiting more energetically demanding activities like stopping to search for dispersed individuals, turning to visually check on individuals behind, or communicating vocally.

==Classification==

Diplodocidae was the third name given to what is now recognized as the single family of long-necked, whip-tailed sauropods. Edward Drinker Cope named the family Amphicoeliidae in 1878 for his genus &quot;Amphicoelias&quot;, sometimes considered a diplodocid. However, the name Amphicoeliidae did not come into wider use and was not used in the scientific literature after 1899, making it a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot; (&quot;forgotten name&quot;) according to the ICZN, preventing it from displacing the name Diplodocidae as a senior synonym. More recent studies have also shown that &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; itself does not belong to this family, but is instead a more primitive diplodocoid. A similar situation occurred for the family name Atlantosauridae, named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, and which Hay argued had priority over Amphicoelidae. George Olshevsky declared Atlantosauridae a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot; in 1991, though scientists such as Steel and Nowinski had treated Atlantosauridae as a valid name as late as 1971, and the former even added a subfamily, Atlantosaurinae.

Some dinosaurs have been considered diplodocids in the past but have not been found to be members of that group in later, larger analyses of the family&#x27;s relationships. &quot;Australodocus&quot;, for example, was initially described as a diplodocid, but may actually have been a Macronarian. &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; was traditionally considered a diplodocid due to its similar anatomy, but phylogenetic studies showed it to be a more basal member of the Diplodocoidea.

The relationships of species within Diplodocidae has also been subject to frequent revision. A study by Lovelace, Hartman and Wahl in 2008 found that &quot;Suuwassea&quot; and &quot;Supersaurus&quot; were relatives of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, within the subfamily Apatosaurinae. However, a subsequent analysis by Whitlock in 2011 showed that &quot;Supersaurus&quot; is slightly closer to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; than to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and that &quot;Suuwassea&quot; is actually a primitive dicraeosaurid.

The subfamily Diplodocinae, was erected to include &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and its closest relatives, including &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. The Portuguese &quot;Dinheirosaurus&quot; and the African &quot;Tornieria&quot; have also been identified as close relatives of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; by some authors.

==Evolution and biogeography==

Diplodocids probably evolved in North America, where most diplodocid fossils are found. However, diplodocids have been found on most continents, including South America, Europe, and Africa. Diplodocids and their close relatives, dicraeosaurids, must have diverged from each other by the time the earliest known dicraeosaurid, &quot;Lingwulong&quot;, appears in the fossil record. &quot;Lingwulong&quot; was originally thought to be possibly as old as Early Jurassic, but is now considered to date to the late Middle Jurassic.

Most diplodocids lived during the Jurassic period, but they survived into the Early Cretaceous, at least in Africa and South America. An unnamed diplodocid is known from the Kirkwood Formation of South Africa. &quot;Leinkupal laticauda&quot; is from the Bajada Colorada Formation of Argentina, and indeterminate diplodocid material is known from the nearby Mulichinco Formation of similar age.

<text>Hans Prinzhorn (6 June 1886 – 14 June 1933) was a German psychiatrist and art historian.

==Biography==

Born in Hemer, Westphalia, he studied art history and philosophy at the universities of Tübingen, Leipzig and Munich, then receiving his doctorate under Theodor Lipps with the dissertation &quot;Gottfried Semper&#x27;s basic aesthetic views&quot; in 1908. He then went to the Leipzig Conservatory in 1909 and received lessons in music theory and piano. Afterwards he went to London to pursue his desire of becoming a singer, however his voice was ultimately not good enough for an artistic career.
During the First World War, he assisted a military surgeon and in 1913 he finally started studying medicine, receiving his training at the universities of Freiburg and Strasbourg. He completed his second doctorate (in medicine) in 1919 at the University of Heidelberg after an invitation from Karl Wilmanns, with the dissertation &quot;The artistic capabilities of the mentally ill&quot;.

In 1919 he became assistant to Karl Wilmanns at the psychiatric hospital of the University of Heidelberg. His task was to expand an earlier collection of art created by the mentally ill and started by Emil Kraepelin. When he left in 1921 the collection was extended to more than 5,000 works by about 450 &quot;cases&quot;.

In 1922 he published his first and most influential book, &quot;Bildnerei der Geisteskranken. Ein Beitrag zur Psychologie und Psychopatologie der Gestaltung&quot; (&quot;Artistry of the mentally ill: A Contribution to the Psychology and Psychopathology of Configuration&quot;), richly illustrated with examples from the collection. While his colleagues were reserved in their reaction, the art scene was enthusiastic. Jean Dubuffet was highly inspired by the works, and the term Art Brut was coined.

The book is mainly concerned with the borderline between psychiatry and art, illness and self-expression. It represents one of the first attempts to analyse the work of the mentally ill.

After short stays at sanatoriums in Zürich, Dresden and Wiesbaden, he began a psychotherapy practice in Frankfurt in 1925, but without much success. He published a follow up project to his first book, titled &quot;Bildnerei der Gefangenen&quot; (Artistry of Prisoners) in 1926, however it was met with little success. He also wrote poems, which were published by a private publisher after his death. He continued to write numerous other books which were mainly on the field of psychotherapy. He approached psychology with an original method where he combined philosophy, anthropology and psychoanalysis. He went on to give lectures over radio, and he was a sought-after speaker home and abroad. He went to an invitation-based lecture tour of US universities in 1929. His original approach was well respected within the German community, however it was largely forgotten due to the dominant force of experimental psychology. His hopes to find a permanent position at a university were never fulfilled. Disillusioned by professional failures, and after three failed marriages, he moved in with an aunt in Munich and retreated from public life, making a living from giving lectures and writing essays. He died in 1933 in Munich after contracting typhus on a trip to Italy.

Shortly after his death the Prinzhorn Collection was stowed away in the attics of the university. In 1938 a few items were displayed in the Nazi propaganda exhibition &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; (&quot;Degenerate Art&quot;). Since 2001 the collection has been on display in a former oratory of the University of Heidelberg.

<text>The Grand Knockout Tournament (also known as It&#x27;s a Royal Knockout) was a one-off charity event which took place on 15 June 1987, and was shown on British television on 19 June 1987 (BBC1, repeated on 27 December 1987), in addition to airing on American TV via the USA Network on 12 August 1987, and European satellite channel Superchannel on 6 March 1988 (repeated on Christmas Day 1988).

The event was staged on the lakeside lawn of the Alton Towers stately home and theme park in Staffordshire. It followed the format of &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; (the British version of &quot;Jeux sans frontières&quot;), a slapstick TV game show which was broadcast in the UK until 1982. The show featured members of the British royal family alongside various sporting and showbiz celebrities. The celebrity participants were drawn from the realms of music, sport, television, comedy and film.

Although regarded as a failure, a similar show without royal involvement was made the following year at Walt Disney World in Florida, featuring teams of celebrities representing the United Kingdom, USA and Australia.

The show was conceived and organised by Prince Edward, who had been keen to develop a career in TV and theatre after he left the Royal Marines. The show featured Prince Edward, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of York as non-participating team captains, each of whom supported a different charity.

The show was hosted by Stuart Hall, Les Dawson and Su Pollard, with Hal Linden providing commentary for the U.S. telecast. Paul Daniels and Geoff Capes were timekeepers. Aled Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Barbara Windsor were heralds of the tournament. The Duke of Abercorn, the Duke of Westminster, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Roxburghe acted as impartial judges for each of the four teams.

== Aftermath ==
Immediately after the event, Prince Edward asked the assembled journalists, &quot;Well, what did you think?&quot; The journalists, unbeknownst to Prince Edward, hadn&#x27;t seen the event properly as they had been kept confined in the press tent, separate from the celebrities and members of the royal family who had taken part, and were underwhelmed and unhappy at such an arrangement. They responded with nervous laughter and Prince Edward stormed out of the press conference, sarcastically thanking the journalists for their enthusiasm.

Reportedly the Queen disapproved of the event and all of her courtiers had advised against it. Neither she, the Duke of Edinburgh nor the Prince and Princess of Wales agreed to take part, but Edward persevered and the project went to completion. Nonetheless, the event drew an audience of 18 million domestically, making it the fourth most-watched programme of the year. It was later watched by 400 million viewers worldwide and raised over £1.5 million for the respective charities.

<text>Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete (born 7 October 1950) is a Tanzanian politician who was the fourth president of Tanzania, in office from 2005 to 2015. 

Prior to his election as president, he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2005 under his predecessor, Benjamin Mkapa. He also served as the chairperson of the African Union in 2008–2009 and the chairman of the Southern African Development Community Troika on Peace, Defence and Security in 2012–2013.

==Early life and education==
Kikwete was born and raised in Msoga in the Chalinze District of Tanzania, in 1950. He is of Kwere heritage. 

Between 1959 and 1963, Kikwete attended Karatu Primary School and Tengeru School from 1963 to 1965, both in Arusha Region. After Tengeru, Kikwete moved back to home to Pwani Region and attended Kibaha Secondary School for his O-levels, which took place between 1966 and 1969. 

He then moved to Tanga Region, where he studied at the Tanga Technical Secondary School for his advanced level education. He graduated from the University of Dar es Salaam in 1975 with a degree in political science and public relations.

==Career==

As a party cadre, Kikwete moved from one position to another in the party ranks and from one location to another in the service of the party. When TANU and Zanzibar&#x27;s Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) merged to form Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in 1977, Kikwete was moved to Zanzibar and assigned the task of setting up the new party&#x27;s organisation and administration in the islands. In 1980, he was moved to the headquarters as administrator of the Dar es Salaam head office and head of the Defence and Security Department before moving again up-country to the regional and district party offices in Tabora Region (1981–84) and Singida Region and Nachingwea (1986–88) and Masasi District (1988) in the country&#x27;s southern regions of Lindi and Mtwara respectively. In 1988, he was appointed to join the central government.

In 1994, at 44, he became one of the youngest finance ministers in the history of The United Republic of Tanzania. In December 1995, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, being appointed by President Benjamin William Mkapa of the third phase government. He held this post for ten years, until he was elected President of the United Republic of Tanzania in December 2005, hence becoming the country&#x27;s longest serving foreign minister. During his tenure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tanzania played a significant role in bringing about peace in the Great Lakes region, particularly in The Democratic Republic Of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Kikwete was also deeply involved in the process of rebuilding regional integration in East Africa. Specifically, several times, he was involved in a delicate process of establishing a customs union between the three countries of the East African Community (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania), where, for quite some time, he was a chairman of the East Africa Community&#x27;s Council of Ministers.

Kikwete also participated in the initiation, and became a co-chair, of the Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy. On 4 May 2005, Kikwete emerged victorious among 11 CCM members who had sought the party&#x27;s nomination for presidential candidacy in the general election. After a 14 December 2005 multiparty general election, he was declared the winner by the Electoral Commission on 17 December and was sworn in as the fourth president of the United Republic of Tanzania on 21 December.

On 26 May 2013, Kikwete said at a meeting of the African Union that if President Joseph Kabila of the DRC could negotiate with the March 23 Movement, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda should be able to negotiate with the Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the Liberation of Uganda and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, respectively. In response, Museveni expressed his willingness to negotiate.

On 31 January 2016, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Zuma, appointed Jakaya Kikwete the African Union High Representative in Libya. Following the crisis in Libya, Kikwete&#x27;s role is to lead the AU&#x27;s efforts on achieving peace and stability in Libya. Later that year, he was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to serve as member of the Lead Group of the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement. Since 2022, he has been a co-chairing the Commission for Universal Health convened by Chatham House, alongside Helen Clark.

==Personal life ==
Kikwete is an avid sports enthusiast and played basketball competitively in school. He has been a patron of the Tanzania Basketball Federation for the past 10 years. He is married to Salma and they have five children.

As of 4 April 2013, Kikwete was the sixth most followed African leader on Twitter with 57,626 followers.

==History==

Qingxi has a cultural foundation based in its history of Hakka culture. Qingxi was at first a uninhabited mountainous place. 800 years ago, during the Hongwu period of the Ming dynasty, Hakka people began moving into Qingxi from the Central Plain. They were touched by the overlapping steep peaks surrounding the place, and the crystal clear stream coming out of the mouth of the Yinping Mountain. Deer drank water from the stream, and the place was given the name Qingxi, also known as Deer City. At first, Hakka people opened up wasteland in the remote mountainous regions where they lived in thatched shacks. Later, they gradually moved to plain areas down the hills. Struggling with nature for hundreds of years, they survived and multiplied until today.

== Infrastructure ==
30 years of construction and development after reform and opening-up rapidly transformed Qingxi from a remote village based on agriculture into a modern industrialized town. The town has convenient access to traffic, with over of high-grade highway.

Recent improvements include Qingxi Forest Park, featuring hiking trails along Qingxi mountain streams up to an 818-meter peak, and Qingxi Culture Park, a mid-town green-space along a stream featuring sports courts, walking paths and footbridges, and carnival rides.

==Economy==
Economically, Qingxi has specialized in the electronics industry, particularly in high-tech areas such as the manufacture of computer monitors, motherboards, other computer peripherals, and children&#x27;s products. According to the town&#x27;s official website, foreign direct investment currently totals over US $2 billion, with some 800 foreign-funded enterprises investing in the area. Notable brands and factories in the town are LiteON, Kenwood &amp; De&#x27;Longhi, Omron, Chicony, Phihong, FoxLink, and Ablelink. As of the first half of 2024, Qingxi&#x27;s GDP amounted to 16.65 billion RMB.

Recent additions in the city include several hotels, supermarkets along with many new high-rise apartment buildings.

==Transportation==

Daojiao will host 3 Dongguan Rail Transit stations under the current plans for construction of Line 4:

<doc id="1137895" wikidata="Q6482708" url="?curid=1137895" title="Lamsa Bible">
<text>The Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts (commonly called the Lamsa Bible) was published by George M. Lamsa in 1933. It was derived, both Old and New Testaments, from the Syriac Peshitta, the Bible used by the Assyrian Church of the East and other Syriac Christian traditions. 

Lamsa, following the tradition of his church, claimed that the Aramaic New Testament was written before the Greek version, a view known as Aramaic primacy. This contrasts with the academic consensus that the language of the New Testament was Greek. Lamsa thus claimed his translation was superior to versions based on later Greek manuscripts. While Lamsa&#x27;s claims are rejected by the academic community, his translation remains the best known Aramaic to English translation of the New Testament.

==Textual differences between Peshitta and Greek manuscripts==
Some places in Lamsa&#x27;s translation differ from the Greek texts used as the basis of other English-language Bibles.
===Matthew 27:46===
An example is found in Matthew , where Lamsa has &quot;My God, my God, for this I was spared!&quot; where the Greek text has &quot;My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; 
And about the ninth hour
Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
that is to say,
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
This is rendered in Lamsa&#x27;s translation:

And about the ninth hour,
Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said,
Eli, Eli lemana shabakthan!
My God, my God, for this I was spared!

Though in fact the Peshitta does not have four lines in this verse. The 1905 United Bible Societies edition by George Gwilliam of the Peshitta in Syriac contains only three lines, the Aramaic &quot;Eli, Eli.. &quot; (ܐܝܠ ܐܝܠ) etc. not being given twice:

This verse in Greek manuscripts states that from the Cross, Jesus (quoting Psalm 22:1) cried out, &#x27;My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?&#x27; (See Matthew 27:46) proponents of the priority of the Aramaic New Testament such as George Lamsa claim this verse is a mistranslation into Greek.

===Matthew 19:24===
Some scholars of the Peshitta and the Greek New Testament claim that in Matthew 19:24 as the Aramaic word for &#x27;camel&#x27; is written identically to the word for &#x27;rope.&#x27; an error occurred due to the translator&#x27;s limitations when the original scrolls were being transferred into Greek. This would mean Matthew 19:24 commonly translated as, &#x27;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.&#x27; Would read &#x27;rope&#x27; instead of &#x27;camel&#x27;. To support this they claim that rope, is much more in keeping with the imagery of a needle, and that it is probably what Jesus said, and what was originally recorded. Saint Cyril in his commentary on the Holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 18:25) says that camel is the term used by those versed in navigation for a thick rope, thereby both stating that the term camel is the right one and that its meaning is that of a rope and not the animal. This suggests the Lamsa &#x27;rope&#x27; translation is the more accurate &quot;meaning&quot; translation and &#x27;camel&#x27; is the more accurate 1st century &quot;slang&quot; translation.

<text>Robert Wood &quot;General&quot; Johnson II (April 4, 1893 – January 30, 1968) was an American businessman. He was one of the sons of Robert Wood Johnson I, the co-founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson. He turned the family business into one of the world&#x27;s largest healthcare corporations.

==Early life==

Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on April 4, 1893. His father was Robert Wood Johnson I, co-founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and his mother was Evangeline Brewster Armstrong Johnson. Johnson grew up with three siblings: Roberta Johnson, John Seward Johnson I, and Evangeline Johnson. When he was sixteen, their father died, leaving him an estate of $2,000,000 (). He attended Rutgers Preparatory School before dropping out to start working full-time at Johnson &amp; Johnson.

==Career==

Johnson became vice president at J&amp;J in 1918. Johnson also had an abiding interest in politics, and served a term as the mayor of Highland Park, New Jersey from 1920 to 1922. He was elected president of Johnson &amp; Johnson from 1932 to 1938, and became chairman of the board of J&amp;J in 1938. Johnson also held a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II, Johnson&#x27;s work in identifying products needed by the war effort resulted in the Permacell division of J&amp;J inventing duct tape for sealing ammunition boxes. J&amp;J plant managers simply took their existing cloth medical adhesive tape, added a waterproof plastic layer with a more aggressive adhesive, and produced it in olive drab (OD) green to match the ammunition cans. During the war, J&amp;J would become a major supplier for combat first aid kits and other military supplies. In 1941, Johnson started the Ethicon subsidiary.

In 1942, Johnson&#x27;s reserve Army commission was activated, and he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and assigned to the Ordnance Department. That same year he was nominated by the Roosevelt administration to be vice-chairman of the board of the War Plants Corporation (WPC). When the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) was established as a division of the WPC in June 1942, Johnson was named chairman of the board of the SWPC., which regulated wartime production of military goods and defense items in smaller defense plants and businesses (500 or fewer employees) dispersed throughout the U.S. economy. The SWPC made direct loans, encouraged commercial lenders to make credit available to small businesses, and advocated for small businesses with federal agencies and larger corporate enterprises.

During his tenure as chairman of the SWPC, Johnson personally oversaw war contracts assigned to more than 6,000 companies. His tenure was a troubled one, and was marked by complaints from small businesses that they were not being awarded a significant portion of the most valuable wartime defense contracts. During 1943, firms with under 100 employees were awarded 86,000 contracts, about 35% of the total number awarded (241,531), but worth only 3.5% of the total value ($35.3 million) of all contracts awarded by the SWPC. Johnson responded by increasing the number of contracts to small businesses; however, instead of examining each company to determine what contribution each could make to the war effort, the SWPC began distributing contracts as a form of relief to prevent setbacks to small concerns with unused factory plant capacity.

As chairman of the SWPC and an Army general in the Ordnance Branch, Johnson had a tendency to overrule service branch requests for approval for production of specific military armament and ordnance items in favor of competing but less capable designs that could be made more rapidly or with lower material costs, freeing scarce but non-critical materials to small companies so that they could begin the transition to peacetime goods production. This infuriated Johnson&#x27;s military superiors in the War Department, who realized that the diversion of materials to peacetime production meant less factory capacity for new weapons and increased production of war materiel just as victory seemed to be within the grasp of Allied forces. Unfazed, Johnson lost no opportunity in annoying his military superiors, frequently citing his business experience in support of his decisions.

Matters came to a head in the fall of 1943, when the entire Michigan regional division of the SWPC resigned in protest over the actions of the parent board, stating that the SWPC was &quot;nothing more than a glorified publicity agency&quot;. Thomas W. Moss, regional director, announced in a press release that the resignations of the entire Michigan regional division board were included in a resolution sent to Johnson on September 29, 1943. Two days later, on October 1, 1943, Johnson resigned his chairmanship of the SWPC, citing ill health as the reason for his sudden departure.

Johnson returned to his chairmanship at J&amp;J in 1943. He was responsible for writing the Johnson &amp; Johnson Credo, a statement of business principles which is carved into the wall of the company&#x27;s New Jersey headquarters. The Credo states that the company&#x27;s first responsibility is to “the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and all others who use our products”, and also sets out responsibilities to customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, communities and stockholders.

In 1962, Johnson, as chairman of the board of J&amp;J, fired his nephew, John Seward Johnson II. In 1965, he fired his own son, Robert Wood Johnson III.

==Personal life==
In 1916, Johnson married Elizabeth Dixon Ross. They had one child: Robert Wood Johnson III. Their marriage lasted until 1928, when they began a two-year trial separation, ending in divorce. In 1930, Johnson married Margaret (Maggi) Shea. They had one adopted child, Sheila Johnson Brutsch (born 1939). The couple divorced in 1943 after Bob met Evelyn Vernon.

In 1944, Johnson married Evelyn Vernon (née Paynter), a former ballet dancer and a dance instructor who, like Johnson, was married when they met. 

In 1928, Johnson had taken up residence at Morven in Princeton, New Jersey, the historic home of the Stockton family. It was converted into the New Jersey Governor&#x27;s mansion after Johnson&#x27;s lease on the property ended in 1945. 

Johnson died in 1968 at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City; he left the bulk of his $400,000,000 estate to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Johnson was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in North Brunswick, New Jersey.

==Recognition==
In 2008, Johnson was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<text>U.S. Highway 178 (US 178) is a spur of U.S. Highway 78. It currently runs for from Dorchester, South Carolina, at U.S. Highway 78 to Rosman, North Carolina, at U.S. Highway 64. It passes through the states of South Carolina and North Carolina. It goes through the cities of Pickens, Anderson, North, Orangeburg, Harleyville, South Carolina and Bowman, South Carolina.

==Route description==
US 178 has a length of in North Carolina and spans in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System from I-85 near Anderson to US 378 in Saluda.

US 178 begins at an intersection with US 64 just west of the town of Rosman within Pisgah National Forest in southern Transylvania County, North Carolina. The two-lane road, which is named Pickens Highway, heads east into the town parallel to the French Broad River. US 178 turns south onto Chestnut Street, crosses the river to leave the town, and turns east again to parallel the river. The highway veers away from the mainstem of the French Broad to follow its Middle Fork south then east, then turns south and climbs to the Eastern Continental Divide at Eastatoe Gap between Burnt Mountain and Indian Camp Mountain. US 178 enters Pickens County, South Carolina, and its name changes to Moorefield Memorial Highway shortly after it begins its curvaceous and steep descent along Eastatoe Creek to Rocky Bottom. There, the U.S. Highway meets the western end of F. Van Clayton Memorial Highway, which leads to the highest point in South Carolina, Sassafras Mountain.

US 178 crosses another ridge into the valley of Reedy Cove Creek, then climbs again to Beasley Gap between Rich Mountain and Horse Mountain. From there, the highway has a sharp and curvy descent to the valley of the Oolenoy River, which it follows east to near its junction with SC 11 (Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway) at the hamlet of Holly Springs. US 178 curves south at its intersection with SC 288 (Table Rock Road), has a short climb to Mosley Gap between Mosley Mountain and Walnut Cove Mountain, and follows several different creeks through the foothills, which the highway exits as it enters the town of Pickens. The highway expands to four lanes and enters the town on Ann Street and has a very brief concurrency with SC 183 (Main Street) in the center of town; SC 183 connects US 178 with SC 8. US 178 leaves the town along Pendleton Street and drops to two lanes again south of town. The highway passes Pickens County Airport on its way to Liberty. The U.S. Highway, which enters the town along Pickens Drive, intersects SC 93 (Main Street) in the center of the town and has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Greenville District as it leaves town along Anderson Drive. Just south of the town limits, US 178 has a diamond interchange with US 123 (Calhoun Memorial Highway).

US 178 meets the southern end of SC 135 shortly before entering Anderson County, where the highway becomes Liberty Highway and intersects SC 88 (Old Greenville Highway). The highway crosses the Six and Twenty Creek arm of Lake Hartwell and temporarily expands to four lanes around its intersection with US 176 Connector, which feeds into SC 28&#x27;s western bypass of Anderson, Pearman Dairy Road. US 178 gradually approaches US 76 and SC 28 Business (Clemson Boulevard) as it enters a commercial area before meeting and joining those highways at an oblique intersection. The three highways follow an undivided highway with three southbound lanes, two northbound lanes, and a center turn lane into the city of Anderson, where the road&#x27;s name changes to Main Street and passes to the east of the Civic Center of Anderson. South of Anderson Mall, SC 28 Business continues on Main Street while US 178 and US 76 veer onto four-lane North Avenue, which parallels Main Street on the west. Shortly after North Avenue splits into one-way carriageways split by a wide parked median, the avenue veers east toward Main Street and the U.S. Highways continue along Club Drive and Park Drive, which have several sports field in their wide median.

US 178 and US 76 enter downtown Anderson along four-lane Murray Avenue, which runs one block to the west of Main Street.

US 178 is signed north–south in North Carolina and east–west in South Carolina; which is why it is listed as having a northern and eastern terminus.

==Future==
NCDOT plans to modernize a section of US 178, between Rosman and the South Carolina state line. The project includes widening lanes to , from the current , adjust its alignment and add a climbing lane. At an estimated cost of $14.1 million, it is currently unfunded.

<doc id="1137903" wikidata="Q2912653" url="?curid=1137903" title="Uninitialized variable">
<text>In computing, an uninitialized variable is a variable that is declared but is not set to a definite known value before it is used. It will have &quot;some&quot; value, but not a predictable one. As such, it is a programming error and a common source of bugs in software.

== Example of the C language ==
A common assumption made by novice programmers is that all variables are set to a known value, such as zero, when they are declared. While this is true for many languages, it is not true for all of them, and so the potential for error is there. Languages such as C use stack space for variables, and the collection of variables allocated for a subroutine is known as a stack frame. While the computer will set aside the appropriate amount of space for the stack frame, it usually does so simply by adjusting the value of the stack pointer, and does not set the memory itself to any new state (typically out of efficiency concerns). Therefore, whatever contents of that memory at the time will appear as initial values of the variables which occupy those addresses.

Here&#x27;s a simple example in C:

void count( void )
 int k, i;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)

The final value of codice_1 is undefined. The answer that it must be 10 assumes that it started at zero, which may or may not be true. Note that in the example, the variable codice_2 is initialized to zero by the first clause of the codice_3 statement.

Another example can be when dealing with structs. In the code snippet below, we have a codice_4 which contains some variables describing the information about a student. The function codice_5 leaks memory contents because it fails to fully initialize the members of codice_6. If we take a closer look, in the beginning, codice_7, codice_8 and codice_9 are initialized. But the initialization of the codice_10 and codice_11 members are incorrect. This is because if the length of codice_10 and codice_11 character arrays are less than 16 bytes, during the codice_14, we fail to fully initialize the entire 16 bytes of memory reserved for each of these members. Hence after codice_15&#x27;ing the resulted struct to codice_16, we leak some stack memory to the caller.
struct student {
 unsigned int age;
 unsigned int semester;
 char first_name[16];
 char last_name[16];
 unsigned int student_number;

int register_student(struct student *output, int age, char *first_name, char *last_name)
 // If any of these pointers are Null, we fail.
 if (!output || !first_name || !last_name)
 printf(&quot;Error!\n&quot;);
 return -1;

 // We make sure the length of the strings are less than 16 bytes (including the null-byte)
 // in order to avoid overflows
 if (strlen(first_name) &gt; 15 || strlen(last_name) &gt; 15) {
 printf(&quot;first_name and last_name cannot be longer than 16 characters!\n&quot;);
 return -1;

 // Initializing the members
 struct student new_student;
 new_student.age = age;
 new_student.semester = 1;
 new_student.student_number = get_new_student_number();
 strcpy(new_student.first_name, first_name);
 strcpy(new_student.last_name, last_name);

 //copying the result to output
 memcpy(output, &amp;new_student, sizeof(struct student));
 return 0;


In any case, even when a variable is &quot;implicitly&quot; initialized to a &quot;default&quot; value like 0, this is typically not the &quot;correct&quot; value. Initialized does not mean correct if the value is a default one. (However, default initialization to 0 is a right practice for pointers and arrays of pointers, since it makes them invalid before they are actually initialized to their correct value.) In C, variables with static storage duration that are not initialized explicitly are initialized to zero (or null, for pointers).

Not only are uninitialized variables a frequent cause of bugs, but this kind of bug is particularly serious because it may not be reproducible: for instance, a variable may remain uninitialized only in some branch of the program. In some cases, programs with uninitialized variables may even pass software tests.

== Impacts ==
Uninitialized variables are powerful bugs since they can be exploited to leak arbitrary memory or to achieve arbitrary memory overwrite or to gain code execution, depending on the case. When exploiting a software which utilizes address space layout randomization (ASLR), it is often required to know the base address of the software in memory. Exploiting an uninitialized variable in a way to force the software to leak a pointer from its address space can be used to bypass ASLR.

==Use in languages==
Uninitialized variables are a particular problem in languages such as assembly language, C, and C++, which were designed for systems programming. The development of these languages involved a design philosophy in which conflicts between performance and safety were generally resolved in favor of performance. The programmer was given the burden of being aware of dangerous issues such as uninitialized variables.

In other languages, variables are often initialized to known values when created. Examples include:
* VHDL initializes all standard variables into special &#x27;U&#x27; value. It is used in simulation, for debugging, to let the user to know when the don&#x27;t care initial values, through the multi-valued logic, affect the output.
* Java does not have uninitialized variables. Fields of classes and objects that do not have an explicit initializer and elements of arrays are automatically initialized with the default value for their type (false for boolean, 0 for all numerical types, null for all reference types). Local variables in Java must be definitely assigned to before they are accessed, or it is a compile error.
* Python initializes local variables to codice_17 (distinct from codice_18) and raises an codice_19 when such a variable is accessed before being (re)initialized to a valid value.
* D initializes all variables unless explicitly specified by the programmer not to.

Even in languages where uninitialized variables are allowed, many compilers will attempt to identify the use of uninitialized variables and report them as compile-time errors. Some languages assist this task by offering constructs to handle the initializedness of variables; for example, C# has a special flavour of call-by-reference parameters to subroutines (specified as codice_20 instead of the usual codice_21), asserting that the variable is allowed to be uninitialized on entry but will be initialized afterwards.

<text>A House-Boat on the Styx is a fantasy novel written by John Kendrick Bangs in 1895. The original full title was &quot;A House-Boat on the Styx: Being Some Account of the Divers Doings of the Associated Shades&quot;. The novel was first published by Harper Brothers in 1896 with illustrations by Peter Newell (24 plates).

==Plot summary==

The premise of the book is that everyone who has ever died (up to the time in which the book is set, which seems to be about the time of its publication) has gone to Styx, the river that circles the underworld.

The book begins with Charon, ferryman of the Styx being startled—and annoyed—by the arrival of a houseboat on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat&#x27;s janitor.

What follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary thought experiment to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology. In the twelfth chapter the house boat disappears, leading into the sequel, &quot;The Pursuit of the House-Boat&quot;.

==Notes==
&quot;A House-Boat on the Styx&quot; appears to have no original fictional characters in it. All are borrowed—with varying degrees of licence—from either history or mythology.

Throughout the book, there is a running joke that Shakespeare did not actually write any of his own plays, that they were actually ghostwritten by Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other contemporaries. Will always tries to change the subject quickly when authorship comes into conversation.

The book was on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; list of 10 best-selling novels in the US, 1896.

<text>Abraham Somes (March 14, 1732 – September 7, 1819) was an American soldier and pioneer who was the primary founder of settlements on the scenic Mount Desert Island, which is now part of Acadia National Park in present-day Maine.

== Personal life ==
In 1761, Somes, a cooper by trade, brought his wife (Hannah Herrick) and family from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to the island, along with James Richardson and Richardson&#x27;s family. Somes obtained the land for development on grants from Francis Bernard, the governor of Massachusetts; who, in 1761, still maintained an interest in securing the property for the Crown.

Somes chose to establish a village at the north end of the fjard which cuts through the center of the island. It would later be named after him as Somes Sound, and it is the only natural fjard on the east coast of the United States. Abraham named his settlement Somesville and it would develop into an important trading location that largely allowed for the rest of the island to be permanently colonized in the years following the American Revolutionary War.

During the American Revolution, Abraham Somes served as a 1st Lieutenant in Ezra Young&#x27;s 7 Co., 6 Lincoln Co., regiment of the Massachusetts militia. He also served in Capt. Daniel Sullivan&#x27;s Company of Volunteers in 1779.

After fulfilling his duty in the military, Abraham returned to Somesville, where he lived out his days. He had 13 children.

==Death==
Somes died on September 7, 1819, aged 87. He is interred in Brookside Cemetery in Mount Desert, Maine, as are both of his wives.

<text>Alatri () is an Italian town and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Frosinone in the region of Lazio, with c. 30,000 inhabitants. An ancient city of the Hernici, it is known for its megalithic acropolis.

==History==
The area of the modern city was settled as early as the 2nd millennium BC.

&quot;Aletrium&quot; was a town of the Hernici which, together with Veroli, Anagni and Ferentino, formed a defensive league against the Volsci and the Samnites around 550 BC. In 530 they allied with Tarquinius Superbus&#x27; Rome, confirming the Etruscan influence in the area attested also by archaeology. Alatri was defeated by Rome in 306 BC and forced to accept the citizenship. In Cicero&#x27;s time it was a &quot;municipium,&quot; and continued in this position throughout the imperial period.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city decayed, the only respected authority being represented by the Christian bishop. During the reign of Theodoric the Great (5th century AD) the patrician Liberius promoted the construction of a monastic community, one of the most ancient in the West, where in 528 St. Benedict sojourned briefly. In 543, during the Gothic Wars, Alatri was sacked and destroyed by Totila&#x27;s troops.

In the 12th century the city became an important stronghold of the popes when they were obliged to leave the then unsafe Rome. In the following century it became a free commune, although under the authority of the bishops and the pope, governed by consuls until 1241, when a &quot;podestà&quot; was introduced. In the following centuries it flourished economically and expanded, conquering Collepardo, Guarcino, Trivigliano, Vico and Frosinone, though often hampered by inner strife. In the 15th century Alatri started to lose its freedom, due to the involvement of Ladislaus of Naples and Pope Martin V. After the short seigniory of Filippo Maria Visconti in 1434, the city had to accept papal suzerainty.

Struggles with the neighbouring communes continued, and in 1556 it was occupied by Spanish soldiers. During the Roman Republic, it remained loyal to the pope. During the Napoleonic occupation (1809–1814) numerous members of the papal administration, as well as bishop Giuseppe della Casa, were deported to France. It became part of Italy in 1870.

During World War II it suffered heavy destruction and human victims.

==Main sights==

===Ancient remains===
Alatri has well-preserved polygonal fortifications constructed from well jointed local limestone. It is almost entirely an embanking wall, as is the rule in the cities of this part of Italy, with a maximum height, probably, of about . Two of the gates (of the perhaps five once existing) are still to some extent preserved, and three posterns are to be found.

In the centre of the city rises a hill which was adopted as the citadel. Remains of the fortifications of three successive periods can be traced, of which the last, perhaps a little more recent than that of the city wall, is the best preserved. In the first two periods the construction is rough, while in the third the blocks are very well jointed, and the faces smoothed; they are mostly polygonal in form and are much larger (the maximum about 3 by 2 m) than those of the city wall. A flat surface was formed partly by smoothing off the rock and partly by the erection of huge terrace walls which rise to a height of over , enclosing a roughly rectangular area of . Two approaches to the citadel were constructed, both passing through the wall; the openings of both are rectangular. The architrave of the larger, known as &quot;Porta Maggiore&quot;, measures about in length, in height, in thickness; while that of the smaller is decorated with three &quot;phalli&quot; in relief. Later, though probably in ancient times, a ramp was added on the northern side. In the centre of the &quot;arx&quot; was a building on the site of the present cathedral, of which only a small portion is preserved. Remains of a high-pressure aqueduct, which supplied the town with water and was constructed with other public buildings by L. Betilienus Varus, may still be traced. A temple was excavated in 1889 about a half-mile north of the town, and many fragments of the painted terracottas with which it was decorated were found. A reconstruction of it has been erected in the National Etruscan Museum at Rome.


===Other===
*Cathedral of San Paolo: main church, documented since 930, has Cosmatesque decorations dated to 1222, although the external facade is from a late–18th-century restoration. The layout is that of a Greek cross plan, with a long transept. One of the relics in the church, is the late 13th-century &quot;Ostia Incarnata&quot;; according to tradition it was a eucharistic wafer that miraculously transubstantiated into flesh.
*&quot;Collegiata of Santa Maria Maggiore&quot;: collegiate church likely first erected in the 5th century atop the site of a temple of Venus. First mentioned in 1137, it was restored in Romanesque times and largely rebuilt in the 13th century by craftsmen from Burgundy. The façade has a large 14th-century rose window. The three gates have frescoed lunettes with, in the central one, a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; from the late 14th century. The bell tower was added in 1394; until an earthquake in 1654, it had a cusp cover. The sober interior has a nave and two aisles divided by robust pilasters, with an inner narthex. The left chapels are from modern restorations. Among the artwork housed in the church, a &quot;Constantinopolis Madonna&quot; (13th century), the &quot;Redeemer Tryptych&quot; by Antonio di Alatri, and a &quot;Madonna with Child and St. Salvatore&quot; (early 15th century).
*&quot;San Francesco&quot;: Gothic-style church built by the Franciscans in the late 13th century. It is a compact edifice with original gate and rose window similar to that of Santa Maria Maggiore. The interior has a single nave and Baroque decoration. It houses a &quot;Deposition&quot; painted by Neapolitan school (17th century), and partly ruined 15th-century frescoes. The most striking feature is however the relic of part of St. Francis&#x27; mantle, donated in 1222 to the city by the saint himself.
*&quot;Santo Stefano&quot;: Church from (). Of the original edifice, only the main portal remains.
*&quot;San Silvestro&quot;: Church from (10th-11th centuries). It has two naves, the second added in 1331. The simple and evocative interior houses a precious fresco depicting &quot;St Sylvester and the Dragon&quot; (12th century). The crypt (9th century) has a fresco of a &quot;Blessing Saint&quot; in Byzantine style.
*&quot;Chiesa degli Scolopi&quot; (1734–1745)
*Gottifredo Palace (mid-13th century), the residence of the powerful feudatory cardinal Gottifredo di Raynaldo from Alatri. It is formed by two towerhouses in different styles. It houses the Town Museum.
*Public Records Office: located in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore, the registry houses all public records including Births, Deaths and Marriages for the city going back to the 18th century.

In the neighborhood are:
*The Castle of Osteria di Alatri, also known as &quot;La Grancia di Tecchiena&quot;.
*The &quot;Badia di San Sebastiano&quot;, built in the 6th century by Liberius.
*&quot;Chiesa delle XII Marie&quot; (&quot;Church of the 12 Marys&quot;), a small church from the early 15th century, with interesting frescoes of Saint by Antonio da Alatri

<text>Alexander Briley (born April 12, 1947) is an American singer who was the original &quot;G.I.&quot; in the disco recording act Village People.

==Early life and education==
Briley was born in Harlem, New York City, in 1947, the son of a Christian minister. Raised in Harlem and later Mount Vernon, New York, Briley sang in church from an early age and studied voice at the University of Hartford. Briley had two brothers, Timothy and Jonathan.
==Career==
Briley was introduced to producer/composer Jacques Morali by Village People member Victor Willis. He originally performed in jeans and a T-shirt, but he took the role of a soldier for the album &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot; in 1978, and appeared as a sailor when the group recorded &quot;In the Navy&quot; in 1979. He retired from Village People at 70, after 40 years&#x27; service with a few interruptions.

==Personal life==
=== Jonathan Briley ===
Briley&#x27;s younger brother, Jonathan (1958–2001), worked as an audio engineer at Windows on the World on the 106th floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center and perished in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In 2005, Jonathan was speculated by several people to be The Falling Man – the figure depicted in an iconic photo of a man falling to his death from the North Tower. He was one of an estimated 100–200 people who died on 9/11 either by jumping from, falling from, or being pushed out of the upper stories of the Twin Towers.

<text>David Alexander Colville, LL. D. (August 24, 1920 – July 16, 2013) was a Canadian painter and printmaker.

== Early life and war artist ==
David Alexander Colville was born on August 24, 1920 in Toronto, Ontario, the second son of Scottish immigrant David Harrower Colville and his wife Florence Gault. He moved with his family at age seven to St. Catharines, and then to Amherst, Nova Scotia, in 1929. He attended Mount Allison University from 1938 to 1942, where he studied under Canadian Post-Impressionists like Stanley Royle and Sarah Hart, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.

Colville married Rhoda Wright, who he had been friends with since his first year at &quot;Mount A&quot;, in 1942 and enlisted in the Canadian Army shortly afterwards. He enlisted in the infantry, eventually earning the rank of lieutenant. He painted in Yorkshire and took part in the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s landings in southern France. He was then attached to the 3rd Canadian Division. After being in the army for two years, and because he was a fine-arts student, he was made an Official Second World War artist in May 1944. His unit relieved the 82nd Airborne Division at Nijmegen, Netherlands, in mid-September 1944 during Operation Market Garden and remained there until the following February. He continued on to tours in the Netherlands and Germany, where he was also tasked with depicting the horrors of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Colville&#x27;s painting &quot;Bodies in a Grave&quot; (1946), a scene of emaciated corpses in a Bergen-Belsen burial pit, is based on images he captured with his army-issue camera at the concentration camp.

== Career ==
Colville had some success while still enrolled at Mount Allison, exhibiting at the Art Association of Montreal (now the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) in 1941, and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1942. After the war, Colville returned to New Brunswick and became a faculty member with the Fine Arts Department at Mount Allison University, where he taught from 1946 to 1963. Colville is often cited as belonging to the Magic Realism movement, and within this he developed his own style that influenced both a regional and national art community, as teacher and founder of what would become known as Maritime Realism. By contrast to other members of the Maritime school, the composition of his work involved geometry. Often too, in his later work, he seized on the fugitive moment, imagining a hypothetical &quot;What if&quot; something happened in the conscious world.

Maritime Realism came to fruition during the apex of abstract painting&#x27;s ascendancy both nationally and internationally. Colville influenced a host of students that pursued a realist painting style. Norman Eastman (class of 1952), Hugh Mackenzie (class of 1953), Tom Forrestall (class of 1958), Christopher Pratt (class of 1961) Mary Pratt (class of 1961), Daniel Brown (class of 1961), Nancy Stevens (class of 1962), Ken Tomlie (class of 1962), Roger Savage (class of 1963), Suzanne Hill (class of 1964), Glenn Adams (class of 1965), and Don Pentz (class of 1966).

He left teaching to devote himself to painting and print-making full-time from a studio in his home in Sackville on York Street; this building is now named Colville House. The house was donated to Mount Allison by the Colville family. It now serves as a museum and gallery dedicated to Alex Colville&#x27;s life and work under the auspice of the Owens Art Gallery.

Colville often used his immediate surroundings as subject matter, using his family as models. Throughout his career, his wife Rhoda Colville, who was also an artist and poet, served as a model for a number of his celebrated works. Rhoda Colville&#x27;s recreational life as a swimmer, skater, dancer, singer, pianist and cyclist was featured in her husband&#x27;s pieces, often set in the landscapes and waterways of Annapolis Valley.

In 1966, works by Colville along with those of Yves Gaucher and Sorel Etrog represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1967, Colville was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, elevated to Companion in 1982, the order&#x27;s highest level. In 1973, the University of Windsor gave him an honorary doctor of laws.

Colville lived in St. Catharines, Ontario, for three years before moving to Nova Scotia. In 1973, he moved his family to his wife&#x27;s hometown of Wolfville, where they lived and worked in the house that her father built and in which she was born.

In contrast to many of his contemporaries, Colville aligned himself with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and was a card-carrying party member for many years. In 1981 he was appointed chancellor of Nova Scotia&#x27;s Acadia University serving in that role until 1991. In 1997, he received an honorary degree at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. 

== Personal life and death ==
Colville and his wife, Rhoda Wright, had one daughter and three sons, one of whom predeceased them in 2012. They additionally had eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Wright died on December 29, 2012, after succumbing to dementia.

Colville died on July 16, 2013 at his house in Wolfville at the age of 92, after suffering from a heart condition. His funeral was held on July 24 at Acadia University&#x27;s Manning Memorial Chapel.

== Exhibitions ==

Colville exhibited extensively across Canada and internationally including at the Tate Gallery in London and the Beijing Exhibition Centre in Beijing. In 1983, an international touring retrospective of his work was organized by the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO). In 2003, The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia organized an exhibition titled &quot;Alex Colville: Return&quot; curated by Tom Smart. Upon his death in 2013, the AGO was in the process of mounting &quot;Alex Colville&quot;, the largest exhibition of the artist&#x27;s work to date which opened in 2014.

Alex Colville&#x27;s work is found in many collections including the Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University. The Owens also maintains Colville House, the private home of Colville which acts as an exhibit space for his work. Colville&#x27;s work can also be found in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, the Cape Breton University Art Gallery in Sydney, Nova Scotia, the New Brunswick Museum, Saint John, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Centre National d&#x27;Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne and the Kestnergesellschaft in Hanover, Germany.

== Notable works ==
=== &quot;Infantry, near Nijmegen, Holland&quot; ===

Trained as an infantry officer, he did a painting when World War II ended. Based upon numerous drawings, it was called &quot;Infantry&quot; and is now in the Canadian War Museum. It represents a platoon of Canadian soldiers spread out and marching along both sides of a road. Colville believed it conveyed his perception of war, as both heroism and enduring persistence among nature&#x27;s elements and constant danger. The face of the first man is actually a portrait of the artist&#x27;s father.
=== &quot;Horse and Train&quot; ===

This 1954 work was inspired by two lines from the poet Roy Campbell:

:&quot;Against a regiment I oppose a brain&quot;
:&quot;And a dark horse against an armored train.&quot;

&quot;Horse and Train&quot; is a part of the Art Gallery of Hamilton&#x27;s permanent collection; Dominion Foundries and Steel, Ltd. (Dofasco Inc) donated the painting in 1957. It appears on the cover of the album &quot;Night Vision&quot; by Bruce Cockburn. Alex Colville and &quot;Horse and Train&quot; are mentioned in the introduction (and in the story itself) of Nova Scotia fiction writer Barry Wood&#x27;s short story &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; published in England&#x27;s &quot;Postscripts&quot; #14 in 2008.
The painting can also be seen in the film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), hanging in a hallway during the doctor&#x27;s visit.
=== &quot;To Prince Edward Island&quot; ===

This 1965 painting is perhaps his best-known work. It features a woman depicted looking through binoculars, in the direction of the artist. Colville describes this work as an exploration of &quot;the searching vision of the female&quot; contrasted with the &quot;stupid and passive&quot; man, who she occludes. &quot;The woman sees, I suppose, and the man does not.&quot; &quot;To Prince Edward Island&quot; is referenced in Korean Canadian artist Jin-me Yoon&#x27;s series Long View (2017), specifically in the photograph &quot;Long View&quot;, #1, in which Yoon looks through a pair of binoculars.

=== &quot;The Circuit Rider&quot; ===
His mural in Tweedie Hall at Mount Allison University, known officially as &quot;The History of Mount Allison&quot; or &quot;The Circuit Rider&quot;.

=== &quot;Pacific&quot; ===
His 1967 painting &quot;Pacific&quot;, showing a man leaning against an open door looking out to sea while a Browning Hi-Power pistol rests on a table in the foreground, inspired one of the definitive scenes in the 1995 film &quot;Heat&quot; with actor Robert De Niro.

=== &quot;Man on Verandah&quot; ===
Painted in 1953, its sale at auction for $1.287 million set a record for a work by a living Canadian artist. Part of the estate of the late G. Hamilton Southam (1918–2008), it was sold at an auction of Canadian post-war and contemporary art by Heffel Fine Art Auction House on 25 November 2010. Expected to get up to $600,000, the price inflated during a three-way bidding war between two Canadian phone bidders and a person at the auction.

== List of selected works ==

== Works in other media ==

In 1965, Colville was commissioned to design the images on the Canadian 1867–1967 centennial commemorative coin set. The set consists of the following designs: Rock dove on 1 cent coin, rabbit on 5 cent coin, mackerel on 10 cent coin, lynx on 25 cent coin, wolf on 50 cent coin and goose on the 1 dollar coin.

On 22 March 2002 Canada Post issued &#x27;Church and Horse, 1964, Alex Colville&#x27; in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a painting &quot;Church and Horse&quot; (1964) by Alex Colville. The $1.25 stamps are perforated 13 X 13.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

Several of Colville&#x27;s paintings appear in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot;, including &quot;Woman and Terrier&quot; (1963), &quot;Horse and Train&quot; (1954), &quot;Hound in Field (1958)&quot;, &quot;Dog, Boy, and St. John River&quot; (1958), and &quot;Moon and Cow&quot; (1963).

<text>The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a dog breed recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), but not the American Kennel Club (AKC). It is a medium-sized, short-haired dog, of a solid build, whose early ancestors came from England. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of in height and in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size: males are normally about 18–21 inches (45–53 cm) in height and around 35–60 pounds (15–27 kg) in weight, while females are normally around 17–20 inches (43–50 cm) in height and 30–50 pounds (13–22 kg) in weight.

According to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is described to be medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears are to be small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Many colors, color patterns, and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA, except that both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.

Despite the colloquial use of the term &quot;pit bull&quot; to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of the term to include several breeds in legislation, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true &quot;pit bull&quot; and the only breed that should be denominated as such.

Twelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. Several states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. Pit Bull Terriers are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.

== History ==
Until the mid-19th century the since-extinct Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs were bred together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. This type of dog, which was bred in England, became known as the bull and terrier. These dogs arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth century where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier.

In the United Kingdom, bull and terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting and bear baiting. These bloodsports were banned in 1835 when Britain introduced animal welfare laws. Since dog fighting is cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain. These dogs arrived in America around 1845 to 1860, where the dog fighting practice had continuity. On February 10, 1898, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) named as American Pit Bull Terrier.

For some time in the early part of the 20th century the UKC began to register the breed name with the word &quot;pit&quot; in parentheses (American (Pit) Bull Terrier), to facilitate public acceptance as an American Bull Terrier. However this only lasted a short time and returned to the previous form.

In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt hogs, and drive livestock, and as family companions.

Pit Bull Terriers fill the role of companion dogs, working dogs, athletic sport dogs (weight pulling, French Ring Sport, Top Dog), police dogs, and therapy dogs. Pit Bull Terriers also constitute the majority of dogs used for illegal dog fighting in America In addition, law enforcement organizations report these dogs are used for other nefarious purposes, such as guarding illegal narcotics operations, use against police, and as attack dogs.

In an effort to counter the fighting reputation of pit bull–type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers &quot;St. Francis Terriers&quot;, hoping that people would be more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as &quot;New Yorkies&quot;, but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.

== Temperament ==
The UKC gives this description of the characteristic of the American Pit Bull dog: &quot;The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. The breed&#x27;s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.&quot;

The standard imposed by the ADBA and Old Family Red Nose Registry (OFRNR) considers human aggression a disqualification factor. The American Preservation Dog Registry (APDR) standard points out that &quot;the temperament must be totally reliable with people&quot;.

In September 2000, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study that examined dog-bite–related fatalities (human death caused by dog-bite injuries) to &quot;summarize breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks during a 20-year period and to assess policy implications.&quot; The study examined 238 fatalities between 1979 and 1998 in which the breed of dog was known. It found that &quot;the data indicates that Rottweilers and pit bull–type dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF (dog bite-related fatality) in the United States between 1979 and 1998&quot; and that it was &quot;extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.&quot;

Media portrayal has significantly impacted how the American public views the temperament of APBT. A study from 2002 suggests that &quot;news media exaggerates and exacerbates any real or potential problems that exist with Pit Bulls.&quot; Other studies also note that many people, including experts such as animal control officers and veterinarians, falsely report any stocky short-haired dogs as Pit Bulls. Consequently, Pit Bulls have a lower probability of adoption or even being taken into shelters for care.

== Health ==

Due to their athleticism and diverse breeding background, the breed tends to be hardy, with an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years, longer than many breeds of a similar size. There are some genetic conditions to be watchful for. The breed tends to have bone diseases such as hip dysplasia, canine degenerative myelopathy and kneecap dislocation. The breed can also have skin problems, such as mange and skin allergies, because of its short coat. Other health ailments seen in the breed include thyroid and congenital heart defects.

The breed tends to have a higher than average incidence of hip dysplasia.
Culling for performance has helped eliminate this problem and others such as patella problems, thyroid dysfunction and congenital heart defects. American Pit Bull Terriers with dilute coat colors have not had a higher occurrence of skin allergies as other breeds. As a breed they are more susceptible to parvovirus than others if not vaccinated, especially as puppies, so vaccination is imperative beginning at 39 days old and continuing every 2 weeks until 4 months old, then again at 8 months, and once a year after that, as recommended for all breeds.

They are prone to demodex mange due to culling for performance. There are two different types of demodex mange, namely localized and generalized demodex. Although it is not contagious, it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type, which is generalized demodex mange, is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized mange is usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from sire and dam to their puppies. A simple skin scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat demodex mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since demodex mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.

== Bloodlines ==
The APBT has several bloodlines, many originating in &quot;professional&quot; dog fighting throughout the 20th century.

Others developed for the conformation shows of the United Kennel Club in the 1980s. While the history and ancestry of the APBT bloodlines can provide context and insight into the breed&#x27;s development, it is essential to prioritize responsible breeding practices and the well-being of the individual dogs.

=== Castillo Pit Bulls ===
Founded by Tekla Castillo in the early 1980s, her program focused on conformation standards within the UKC. The Castillo bloodline is a lineage of American Pit Bull Terriers known for its unique combination of different breeding lines, resulting in dogs with desirable traits such as strength, intelligence, and temperament. The bloodline&#x27;s foundation includes dogs such as &quot;PR&quot; Nelson&#x27;s Hazard Joe, born from breeding between Camarano&#x27;s Buster Jo and Coonie&#x27;s Bonnie.

The Castillo bloodline features a mix of other well-known bloodlines, with connections to influential dog breeders like Earl Tudor, Joe Corvino, J.P. Colby, and others. Due to the interconnected nature of the breeding community and the various influences on the bloodline, the Castillo lineage has expanded as a result of the collective efforts of multiple breeders who contributed to its development over time.

=== Colby Pit Bulls ===

The Colby dogs are an ancient black-nosed bloodline that served as one of the pillars of the APBT breed. Considered one of the most important and famous bloodlines, the Colby dogs were started by John Pritchard Colby in 1889, who acquired the best fighting dogs (bull and terriers) imported from Ireland and England. One of the most famous dogs of his bloodline was &quot;Colby&#x27;s Pincher&quot;. Pincher was widely used as a stud dog. For this reason, Pincher is present in the pedigree of the vast majority of APBT specimens. The Colby dogs bloodline remains preserved by the family of John P. Colby.

=== Old Family Red Nose ===
Old Family Red Nose (OFRN) is an old strain or a family of bloodlines originating in Ireland, and known for their specific and unique reddish coloration. Many dogs of the OFRN strain has a copper-red nose and coat, red lips, red toe nails, and red or amber eyes. Not every American Pit Bull Terrier with these characteristics is necessarily an OFRN, since for this the dog must have a high percentage of the recognized bloodlines of this family in its pedigree.In the middle of the 19th century, there was a strain of pit dogs in Ireland that were known as &quot;Old Family&quot;. At that time, all the bloodlines were closely inbred with each family clan. Since red is recessive to all colors but white, the strain was known as &quot;Irish Old Family Reds&quot;. When the dogs began coming to America, they were already showing the red nose. The &quot;Old Family Reds&quot; dogs found their way to America in the 19th century, mainly via Irish immigrants, though many in the United States did import the breed.

Many strains have been crossed with the Old Family Reds at some time in their existence. Consequently, nearly any strain will occasionally throw a red-nosed pup. This means that not every red-nose dog is a true OFRN. The Old Family Reds produced more than their share of good ones unlike other strains are known. Old Family Reds were sought after for their gameness. The original strain continues to be bred.

Although once renowned for its gameness, it was later bred to maintain its unique reddish color. Some of the most reputable breeders of the past, such as Lightner, McClintock, Hemphill, Williams, Menefee, Norrod and Wallace have contributed to the preservation and development of the strain. Finally, as McNolty said in his &quot;30-30 Journal&quot; (1967), &quot;Regardless of one&#x27;s historical perspective, these old amber-eyed, red-nosed, red-toe-nailed, red-coated dogs represent some of the most significant pit bull history and tradition that stands on four legs today.&quot;

== American Staffordshire Terrier ==

In 1935 in England a Cradley Heath bull and terrier strain was accepted and registered as a purebred breed by The Kennel Club as Staffordshire Bull Terrier. One year later in America the American Kennel Club (AKC) noted the growing popularity and acceptance of a similar breed already registered years earlier by the United Kennel Club (UKC), the American Pit Bull Terrier. The AKC finally decided to accept to register and recognize the American breed, but would rename the breed with the commitment that the associate breeders would not breed dogs for dogfighting.

American Bull Terrier without the &quot;pit&quot; (a word that referred to dogfighting arenas) was the first name considered by the AKC, but quickly dismissed due to protests by English Bull Terrier&#x27;s breeders. Yankee Terrier was another option, also dismissed. The name &quot;Staffordshire Terrier&quot; was chosen with the claim that the breed originally came from Staffordshire in England. On June 10, 1936, around 50 UKC dogs entered the AKC stud book under the name Staffordshire Terrier. Wilfred Truman Brandon founded the AKC Staffordshire Terrier Club of America (STCA). The Colby dog named Colby&#x27;s Primo was one of the first to be regarded as an ideal model of the breed standard in the AKC. The AKC stud book was opened a few more times until it was last closed around the 1970s. In 1972 the AKC changed the name of the breed to American Staffordshire Terrier as it already intended to recognize the British Staffordshire Bull Terrier as a separate breed in subsequent years.

An argument persists concerning whether the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier are two separate breeds or still the same breed. Pit Bull and AmStaff breeders have distanced themselves from each other by pursuing different goals over the last 30 years, producing dogs with physical and temperament differences. Since 2015, the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), which has registered the American Pit Bull Terrier since 1909, considers the American Staffordshire Terrier to be a separate breed. The UKC is the only kennel club at the moment to accept to register American Staffordshire Terriers as American Pit Bull Terriers. The UKC conformation champions are very similar to those of the AKC, as both clubs share many judges. The AKC has not accepted to register American Pit Bull Terrier as American Staffordshire Terriers since the late 20th century.

To this day there are dogs called dual registered, dogs registered at the same time as American Staffordshire Terrier in the AKC and American Pit Bull Terrier in the UKC, due to past breeders who decided to keep the two pedigree registers parallel. Since 2015 the ADBA classifies most (or all) of these dual registered (AKC-UKC) dogs as American Staffordshire Terriers.

The ADBA conformation champion dogs differ greatly from UKC and AKC champion dogs. The AKC standard does not accept red nose dogs. The UKC dogs and the AmStaff are generally heavier and more robust and bulky than the ADBA American Pit Bull Terrier dogs.

== Activities ==
American Pit Bull Terriers excel in many dog sports, including weight pulling, dog agility, flyball, lure coursing, and advanced obedience competition. Out of the 115 dogs who have earned UKC &quot;superdog&quot; status (by gaining championship titles in conformation, obedience, agility, and weightpull), 34 have been American Pit Bull Terriers, and another 13 were American Staffordshire Terriers.

The American Pit Bull Terrier is a working dog and is suitable for a wide range of working disciplines due to their intelligence, high energy, and endurance. In the United States they have been used as search and rescue dogs, police dogs performing narcotics and explosives detection, Border Patrol dogs, hearing dogs to provide services to the deaf, as well as general service dogs, including therapy dogs.

In some places they are often a favorite dog for catching feral pigs. Although, the Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) describes how this practice can be dangerous for the hunting dogs, noting that the dogs may experience severe injuries, &quot;heat exhaustion, poisoning, vehicular trauma, snake bite, and accidental shooting&quot;.

== Breed-specific legislation ==

United Kingdom, Brazil, Australia, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, the territory of Puerto Rico, Singapore, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Denmark, Israel, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull–type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions on import and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization.

Certain cities in the United States, as well as the province of Ontario, Canada, have banned ownership of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, it is against the law to own, sell, abandon, give away, or breed a Pit Bull Terrier. , restrictions have been declining with at least 120 repeals since 2018.

In 2014, new statistical evidence emerged regarding the province-wide ban on &quot;pit bulls&quot;, more specifically the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier, in the Canadian province of Ontario. Since the ban had been implemented, dog bites involving pit bull types, as identified by the owners or city investigators, had dropped considerably as the registered populations of these breeds decreased in the province&#x27;s largest city, Toronto. However, &quot;Toronto&#x27;s reported dog bites have been rising since 2012, and in 2013 and 2014, reached their highest levels this century, even as pit bulls and similar dogs neared local extinction,&quot; and evidence published in &quot;Global News&quot; implicates several other dog breeds had contributed to the rise.

<doc id="1137924" wikidata="Q13238" url="?curid=1137924" title="Udmurt language">
<text>Udmurt (; Cyrillic: Удмурт) is a Permic language spoken by the Udmurt people who are native to Udmurtia. As a Uralic language, it is distantly related to languages such as Finnish, Estonian, Mansi, Khanty, and Hungarian. The Udmurt language is co-official with Russian within Udmurtia.

It is written using the Cyrillic alphabet with the addition of five characters not used in the Russian alphabet: Ӝ/ӝ, Ӟ/ӟ, Ӥ/ӥ, Ӧ/ӧ, and Ӵ/ӵ. Together with the Komi and Permyak languages, it constitutes the Permic grouping of the Uralic family. The Udmurt language shares similar agglutinative structures with its closest relative, the Komi language. Among outsiders, it has traditionally been referred to by its Russian exonym, Votyak. Udmurt has borrowed vocabulary from neighboring languages, mainly from Tatar and Russian.

In 2010, per the Russian census, there were around 324,000 speakers of the language in the country, out of the ethnic population of roughly 554,000. Ethnologue estimated that there were 550,000 native speakers (77%) out of an ethnic population of 750,000 in the former Russian SFSR (1989 census), a decline of roughly 41% in 21 years.

==Dialects==
Udmurt varieties can be grouped into three broad dialect groups:
* Northern Udmurt, spoken along the Cheptsa River
* Southern Udmurt
* Besermyan, spoken by the strongly Turkified Besermyans

A continuum of intermediate dialects between Northern and Southern Udmurt is found, and literary Udmurt includes features from both areas. Besermyan is more sharply distinguished.

The differences between the dialects are not major and mainly involve differences in vocabulary, largely attributable to the stronger influence of Tatar in the southern end of the Udmurt-speaking area. A few differences in morphology and phonology still exist as well; for example:
* Southern Udmurt has an accusative ending &quot;-ыз&quot; , contrasting with northern &quot;-ты&quot; .
* Southwestern Udmurt distinguishes an eighth vowel phoneme .
* Besermyan has in place of standard Udmurt (thus distinguishing only six vowel phonemes), and in place of standard Udmurt .

==Phonology==
Unlike other Uralic languages such as Finnish and Hungarian, Udmurt does not distinguish between long and short vowels and does not have vowel harmony.

===Consonants===

The consonants are restricted to loanwords, and are traditionally replaced by respectively. As in Hungarian, Udmurt exhibits regressive voicing and devoicing assimilations (the last element determines the assimilation), but with some exceptions (mostly to distinguish minimal pairs by voicing).

===Vowels===
== Orthography ==
Udmurt is written using a modified version of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet:
==Grammar==
 Udmurt is an agglutinating language. It uses affixes to express possession, to specify mode, time, and so on.

No gender distinction is made in nouns or personal pronouns.

=== Cases ===
Udmurt has fifteen cases: eight grammatical cases and seven locative cases.

There is no congruency between adjectives and nouns in neutral Udmurt noun phrases; in other words, there is no adjective declension as in the inessive noun phrase (&quot;in a big village&quot;; cf. Finnish inessive phrase &#x27;, in which &#x27; &quot;large&quot; is inflected according to the head noun).
*Of all the locative cases, personal pronouns can only inflect in the allative (also called approximative).

=== Plural ===
There are two types of nominal plurals in Udmurt. One is the plural for nouns &quot;-/-&quot; and the other is the plural for adjectives &quot;-/-&quot;.

==== Nominal plural ====
The noun is always in plural. In attributive plural phrases, the adjective is not required to be in the plural:

The plural marker always comes before other endings (i.e. cases and possessive suffixes) in the morphological structure of plural nominal.
==== Predicative plural ====
As in Hungarian and Mordvinic languages, if the subject is plural, the adjective is always plural when it functions as the sentence&#x27;s predicative:

Udmurt pronouns are inflected much in the same way that their referent nouns are. However, personal pronouns are only inflected in the grammatical cases and cannot be inflected in the locative cases.

=== Pronouns ===
==== Personal pronouns ====
Udmurt personal pronouns are used to refer to human beings only. However, the third person singular can be referred to as &quot;it&quot;. The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:
More details:
*There are self-intensifier forms: ачим &#x27;[I] myself&#x27;, ачид &#x27;[you] yourself&#x27;, ачиз &#x27;[he/she/it] himself&#x27;, асьмеос &#x27;[we] ourselves&#x27;, асьтэос &#x27;[you] yourself&#x27;, асьсэос &#x27;[they] yourself&#x27;.

*The 1st person plural has two forms according to clusivity: асьмеос is &quot;inclusive we&quot; and &quot;ми&quot; is &quot;exclusive we&quot;. The younger speakers seem to favor always using &quot;ми&quot; (probably under the influence of Russian &#x27;my&#x27; for &quot;we&quot;), so that for older generation the verse from a popular song &quot;Ойдо, нылаш ми тонэн пумиськом!&quot; sounds strange: its intended meaning is &quot;Hey girl, let us meet!&quot;, while in the traditional thinking it reads &quot;Hey girl, let we all meet with you!&quot; The expected proper phrase would be: &quot;Ойдо, нылаш асьмеос пумиськом!&quot; and &#x27;ми тонэн&#x27; is a calque from the Russian phrase &#x27;my s toboi&#x27; meaning &quot;me and you&quot;, but the word-by-word translation is &quot;we with you&quot;.

==== Interrogative pronouns ====
Udmurt interrogative pronouns inflect in all cases. However, the inanimate interrogative pronouns &#x27;what&#x27; in the locative cases have the base form &quot;-&quot;. The nominative case of interrogative pronouns are listed in the following table:
=== Verbs ===
Udmurt verbs are divided into two conjugation groups, both having the infinitive marker &quot;.

There are three verbal moods in Udmurt: indicative, conditional and imperative. There is also an optative mood used in certain dialects. The indicative mood has four tenses: present, future, and two past tenses. In addition there are four past tense structures which include auxiliary verbs. Verbs are negated by use of an auxiliary negative verb that conjugates with personal endings.

The basic verbal personal markers in Udmurt are (with some exceptions):
*The present tense in Udmurt in all but the third person, is marked with &quot;.

=== Syntax ===
Udmurt is an SOV language.

==Lexicon==
Depending on the style, about 10 to 30 percent of the Udmurt lexicon consists of loanwords. Many loanwords are from the Tatar language, which has also strongly influenced Udmurt phonology and syntax. 
The Udmurt language, along with the Tatar language, influenced the language of the Udmurt Jews, in the dialects of which the words of Finno-Ugric and Turkic origin there were recorded.

==Media==

Eurovision runners-up Buranovskiye Babushki, a pop group composed of Udmurt grandmothers, sing mostly in Udmurt.

The romantic comedy film Berry-Strawberry, a joint Polish-Udmurt production, is in the Udmurt language.

In 2013, the film company &quot;Inwis kinopottonni&quot; produced a film in the Udmurt language called Puzkar (&quot;nest&quot;).

The Bible was first completely translated into Udmurt in 2013.

<text>June 1, 1974 is a live album of songs performed at the Rainbow Theatre in London on the titular date. The album is officially attributed to all principal performers Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Brian Eno and Nico, although other well-known musicians, including Mike Oldfield, Robert Wyatt, and Ollie Halsall, also contributed to the concert. The record has often been referred to as the &quot;A.C.N.E.&quot; album, for the initials of Ayers, Cale, Nico, and Eno.

== Content ==
The cover photograph was taken by Mick Rock in the foyer of the Rainbow Theatre shortly before the concert began. The wry stare between John Cale (right) and Kevin Ayers is said to be explained by the fact that Cale had caught Ayers sleeping with his wife the night before the show. The couple would divorce the next year.

Other songs that were performed but did not make the LP include Ayers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Hard-On for You Baby&quot; (with Cale on backing vocals), Cale&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Ballet&quot; and &quot;Gun&quot;, and Nico&#x27;s &quot;Janitor of Lunacy&quot; and her rendition of &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot;.

Nico’s performance of &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; was released as a bonus track on the 2012 reissue of her 1974 album &quot;The End...&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

<text>A cord blood bank is a facility which stores umbilical cord blood for future use. Both private and public cord blood banks have developed in response to the potential for cord blood in treating diseases of the blood and immune systems. Public cord blood banks accept donations to be used for anyone in need, and as such function like public blood banks. Traditionally, public cord blood banking has been more widely accepted by the medical community. Private cord blood banks store cord blood solely for potential use by the donor or donor&#x27;s family. Private banks typically charge around $2,000 for the collection and around $200 a year for storage.

The policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics states that &quot;private storage of cord blood as &#x27;biological insurance&#x27; is unwise&quot; unless there is a family member with a current or potential need to undergo a stem cell transplantation. The American Academy of Pediatrics also notes that the odds of using one&#x27;s own cord blood is 1 in 200,000 while the National Academy of Medicine says that only 14 such procedures have ever been performed. Private storage of one&#x27;s own cord blood is unlawful in Italy and France, and it is also discouraged in some other European countries. The American Medical Association states &quot;Private banking should be considered in the unusual circumstance when there exists a family predisposition to a condition in which umbilical cord stem cells are therapeutically indicated. However, because of its cost, limited likelihood of use, and inaccessibility to others, private banking should not be recommended to low-risk families.&quot; The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also encourage public cord banking and discourage private cord blood banking. Nearly all cord blood transfusions come from public banks, rather than private banks, partly because most treatable conditions can&#x27;t use one&#x27;s own cord blood.

Cord blood contains hematopoietic stem cells (which can differentiate only into blood cells), and should not be confused with embryonic stem cells or pluripotent stem cells, which can differentiate into any cell in the body. Cord blood stem cells are blood cell progenitors which can form red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is why cord blood cells are currently used to treat blood and immune system related genetic diseases, cancers, and blood disorders. Cord blood is also a source of mesenchymal stem cells, which can further be differentiated to form connective tissues, bones and cartilage. On the possibility that cord blood stem cells could be used for other purposes, the World Marrow Donor Association and European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies states &quot;The possibility of using one’s own cord blood stem cells for regenerative medicine is currently purely hypothetical...It is therefore highly hypothetical that cord blood cells kept for autologous use will be of any value in the future” and “the legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service which has presently no real use regarding therapeutic options.”

==Regulation==
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates cord blood under the category of “Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based-Products.” The Code of Federal Regulations under which the FDA regulates public and private cord blood banks is Title 21 Section 1271. Several states also require accreditation, including New York, New Jersey, and California. Any company not accredited within those states are not legally permitted to collect cord blood from those states, even if the company is based out of state. Potential clients can check the New York accreditation status from the New York Umbilical Cord Blood Banks Licensed to Collect in New York. Both public and private cord blood banks are also eligible for voluntary accreditation with either the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) or the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT). Potential clients can check the current accreditation status of laboratories from the AABB list of accredited cord blood laboratories or the FACT search engine of accredited cord blood banks (on their home page). Other countries also have regulations pertaining to cord blood.

==Collection and cryopreservation==
Cord blood collection happens after the umbilical cord has been cut and is extracted from the fetal end of the cord, diverting up to 75 +/- 23 mL from the neonate. It is usually done within ten minutes of giving birth. Additional stem cells may be collected from the placenta. After the health care provider draws the cord blood from the placental end of the umbilical cord, the placenta is couriered to the stem cell laboratory, where it is processed for additional stem cells. An adequate cord blood collection requires at least 75mL in order to ensure that there will be enough cells to be used for a transplantation. Before the cord blood is stored for later use, it undergoes viral testing, including tests for HIV and Hepatitis B and C, and tissue typing to determine Human Leukocyte Antigen type. It will also be examined for nucleated cell count, cell viability, blood group antigen ABO &amp; Rh blood group system, molecule cluster (CD34), and bacterial and fungal growth.

After the collection, the cord blood unit is shipped to the lab and processed, and then cryopreserved. There are many ways to process a cord blood unit, and there are differing opinions on what the best way is. Some processing methods separate out the red blood cells and remove them, while others keep the red blood cells. However the unit is processed, a cryopreservant is added to the cord blood to allow the cells to survive the cryogenic process. After the unit is slowly cooled to −90 °C, it can then be added to a liquid nitrogen tank which will keep the cord blood unit frozen at −196 °C. The slow freezing process is important to keep the cells alive during the freezing process. There is no consensus yet on optimal procedures for these cord blood cells, although many cryopreservation strategies suggest using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), slow or controlled rate cooling, and rapid thawing.

Cord blood stem cells (though usually from donors) are currently used in the treatment of several life-threatening conditions, mainly blood and immune system related genetic diseases, cancers, and blood disorders. The first clinically documented use of cord blood stem cells was in the successful treatment of a six-year-old boy afflicted by Fanconi anemia in 1988. For two decades after that, cord blood became increasingly recognized as a source of stem cells that can be used in stem cell therapy. Subsequently, with the arrival of newer techniques such as haploidentical transplantation, there has been a trend away from cord blood as the stem cell source.
==Public banks==
Public cord blood banks function like public blood banks, in that they accept donations from anyone, discard donations that fail to meet various quality control standards, and use national registries to find recipients for their samples. Since patients who need cord blood frequently need more cells than a single collection would have provided, public banks frequently combined multiple samples together when preparing the treatment for a single patient. Before the advent of haploidentical bone marrow transplantation, cord blood&#x27;s lack of requirement for an exact genetic match made it easier to provide patients samples from unrelated donors. The percentage of public bank donations discarded as medical waste is often cited to be between 60 and 80%. Some of this is due to contamination that occasionally occurs during collection or complications arising from shipping, though this is mostly due to the fact that most cord blood collections fail to collect enough usable cells. Because matches are almost always likely to be better in a public than a private bank, and cord blood from public banks doesn&#x27;t suffer from the problems it commonly suffers from at private banks (such as potential lower quality control and lower medical usefulness of using a patient&#x27;s own potentially diseased cord blood), public cord blood banking has been more widely accepted by the medical community. One important obstacle facing public banks is the high cost required to maintain them, which has prevented more than a handful from opening. Because public banks do not charge storage fees, medical centers do not always have the funds required to establish and maintain them.

A recent large study by the journal Pediatrics concluded that almost all cord blood transplants come from public banks:

In the Pediatrics study, transplant specialists who collectively have performed thousands of stem cell transplants for childhood leukemia and other illnesses report that only 50 involved privately banked blood. (Support for public cord-blood banking is widespread in the medical community.) Forty-one cases involved blood used to treat a family member, often a sibling; in 36 of those cases the need for a transplant was known before the cord blood was collected. Only nine cases involved giving cord blood back to the donor, a practice known as autologous transplantation and the chief selling point for private cord-blood banking.
==Private banks==
Private banking is typically costly to parents and not covered by insurance. The ability to use the cord blood may also depend on the long-term commercial viability of the enterprise. Accordingly, whether cord blood banking is a worthwhile expenditure for the expectant parent depends in part upon whether the expenditure is offset by the likelihood of ultimately using the cord blood and by the benefits of such use. It is important to ensure the credentials of any potential private bank. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates cord blood under the category of “Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based-Products”. Since the FDA considers cord blood stored at public banks to be &quot;drugs&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t consider cord blood stored at private banks for use by the donor to be drugs, private banks are held to a less stringent regulatory standard.

Historically, cord blood transplants required less stringent matching between the tissue types of the donor and patient, known as their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. Bone marrow transplants required a complete match on six key antigens, to decrease the chance of graft-versus-host disease, known as a 6/6 match. Cord blood transplants achieved the same medical success with only a 4/6 match. HLA type is inherited from both parents, so siblings are particularly likely to be a match, and people from the same ethnic heritage are more likely to match. Minority ethnic groups have difficulty finding a perfectly matched transplant donor. Allogeneic transplants have traditionally had a better outcome when the donor and patient are related, because then the minor antigens also match. The odds that two siblings will have a 6/6 match, for a matched related bone marrow transplant, are 25%. Now that new techniques for haploidentical stem cell transplantation have greatly improved success rates, the requirement for a matched donor is much less of a barrier to transplant. Most families can provide a haploidentical donor.

The policy of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) supports public cord blood banking (similar to the collection and banking of other blood products, i.e. altruistic, anyone can use it), as well as stating that it should only be considered under certain circumstances. The policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics states that &quot;private storage of cord blood as &#x27;biological insurance&#x27; is unwise&quot; unless there is a family member with a current or potential need to undergo a stem cell transplantation. Private storage of one&#x27;s own cord blood is unlawful in Italy and France, and it is also discouraged in some other European countries.

The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation states that public donation of cord blood is encouraged where possible, the probability of using one&#x27;s own cord blood is very small, and therefore storage of cord blood for personal use is not recommended, and family member banking (collecting and storing cord blood for a family member) is recommended when there is a sibling with a disease that may be treated successfully with an allogeneic transplant.

==Ownership of cord blood==
Umbilical cord blood in humans contains the cells and DNA of the baby. However, consent of the mother alone is usually obtained for collection, and the consent of the father is rarely considered.

As of 2007, contracts of the largest cord blood banks do not explicitly state that the cord blood belongs to the donors and child with all the rights and privileges one would reasonably expect from ownership. The ambiguity leaves open future uses not approved by the donors and child. At the majority of private cord blood banking facilities, the mother owns all rights to the cord blood that was banked, until the minor in which the cord blood was taken turns eighteen. At that time the minor has all rights to his or her own banked cord blood.

Concerns have been raised that the current interest in cord blood could cause a perception that cord blood is &quot;unused&quot; by the birth process, thus decreasing the amount of blood which is infused into the child as part of the birth process. The pulsation of the cord pushes blood into the child, and it has been recommended that the cord cease pulsation prior to clamping. With the demand for cord blood increasing, there is a possibility that the cord could be clamped prematurely to preserve even more &quot;extra&quot; cord blood. The American Academy of Pediatricians notes: &quot;if cord clamping is done too soon after birth, the infant may be deprived of a placental blood transfusion, resulting in lower blood volume and increased risk for anemia.&quot;

==Safety and effectiveness==
Using one&#x27;s own cord blood cells might not be wise or effective, especially in cases of childhood cancers and leukemia. Children who develop an immunological disorder often are unable to use their own cord blood for transplant because the blood also contains the same genetic defect.

Additional issues include the possible contamination of the cord blood unit with the same cancer diagnosed later in life; for example, abnormal cells have been detected in filters containing newborn blood of children who were not diagnosed with acute leukemia until the age of 2 to 6 years. The high relapse rates after autologous or syngeneic transplant and the benefit of a graft-vs.-leukemia effect of an allogeneic transplant suggest that autologous cord blood would not be the ideal source of stem cells for patients with leukemia needing a transplant.

In 2024, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described problems with microbial contamination as well as low-volume samples that did not have adequate stem cell counts.

==Confusion with embryonic stem cells==
The public in the United States has a general awareness of embryonic stem cells because of the stem cell controversy. However, cord blood stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells) are not embryonic stem cells (pluripotent stem cells).

<doc id="1137929" wikidata="Q34073" url="?curid=1137929" title="Uto-Aztecan languages">
<text>The Uto-Aztecan languages are a family of native American languages, consisting of over thirty languages. Uto-Aztecan languages are found almost entirely in the Western United States and Mexico. The name of the language family reflects the common ancestry of the Ute language of Utah and the Nahuan languages (also known as Aztecan) of Mexico.

The Uto-Aztecan language family is one of the largest linguistic families in the Americas in terms of number of speakers, number of languages, and geographic extension. The northernmost Uto-Aztecan language is Shoshoni, which is spoken as far north as Salmon, Idaho, while the southernmost is the Nawat language of El Salvador and Nicaragua. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; gives the total number of languages in the family as 61, and the total number of speakers as 1,900,412. Speakers of Nahuatl languages account for over 85% of these.

The internal classification of the family often divides it into two branches: a northern branch including all the languages of the US and a southern branch including all the languages of Mexico, although it is still being discussed whether this is best understood as a genetic classification or as a geographical one. Below this level of classification the main branches are well accepted: Numic (including languages such as Comanche and Shoshoni) and the Californian languages (formerly known as the Takic group, including Cahuilla and Luiseño) account for most of the Northern languages. Hopi and Tübatulabal are languages outside those groups. The Southern languages are divided into the Tepiman languages (including Oʼodham and Tepehuán), the Tarahumaran languages (including Raramuri and Guarijio), the Cahitan languages (including Yaqui and Mayo), the Coracholan languages (including Cora and Huichol), and the Nahuan languages.

The homeland of the Uto-Aztecan languages is generally considered to have been in the Southwestern United States or possibly Northwestern Mexico. An alternative theory has proposed the possibility that the language family originated in southern Mexico, within the Mesoamerican language area, but this has not been generally considered convincing.

==Geographic distribution==

Uto-Aztecan languages are spoken in the North American mountain ranges and adjacent lowlands of the western United States in the states of Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Utah, California, Nevada, and Arizona. In Mexico, they are spoken in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Durango, Zacatecas, Jalisco, Michoacán, Guerrero, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos, Estado de México, and in Mexico City. Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and its modern relatives are part of the Uto-Aztecan family. The Pipil language, an offshoot of Nahuatl, spread to Central America by a wave of migration from Mexico, and formerly had many speakers there. Now it has gone extinct in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and it is nearly extinct in western El Salvador, all areas dominated by use of Spanish.

==Classification==
===History of classification===
Uto-Aztecan has been accepted by linguists as a language family since the early 1900s, and six subgroups are generally accepted as valid: Numic, Takic, Pimic, Taracahitic, Corachol, and Aztecan. That leaves two ungrouped languages: Tübatulabal and Hopi (sometimes termed &quot;isolates within the family&quot;). Some recent studies have begun to question the unity of Taracahitic and Takic and computer-assisted statistical studies have begun to question some of the long-held assumptions and consensuses. As to higher-level groupings, disagreement has persisted since the 19th century. Presently scholars also disagree as to where to draw language boundaries within the dialect continua.

The similarities among the Uto-Aztecan languages were noted as early as 1859 by J. C. E. Buschmann, but he failed to recognize the genetic affiliation between the Aztecan branch and the rest. He ascribed the similarities between the two groups to diffusion. Daniel Garrison Brinton added the Aztecan languages to the family in 1891 and coined the term Uto-Aztecan. John Wesley Powell, however, rejected the claim in his own classification of North American indigenous languages (also published in 1891). Powell recognized two language families: &quot;Shoshonean&quot; (encompassing Takic, Numic, Hopi, and Tübatulabal) and &quot;Sonoran&quot; (encompassing Pimic, Taracahitan, and Corachol). In the early 1900s Alfred L. Kroeber filled in the picture of the Shoshonean group, while Edward Sapir proved the unity among Aztecan, &quot;Sonoran&quot;, and &quot;Shoshonean&quot;. Sapir&#x27;s applications of the comparative method to unwritten Native American languages are regarded as groundbreaking. argued for a three-way division of Shoshonean, Sonoran and Aztecan, following Powell.

As of about 2011, there is still debate about whether to accept the proposed basic split between &quot;Northern Uto-Aztecan&quot; and &quot;Southern Uto-Aztecan&quot; languages. Northern Uto-Aztecan corresponds to Powell&#x27;s &quot;Shoshonean&quot;, and the latter is all the rest: Powell&#x27;s &quot;Sonoran&quot; plus Aztecan. Northern Uto-Aztecan was proposed as a genetic grouping by Jeffrey Heath in based on morphological evidence, and Alexis Manaster Ramer in adduced phonological evidence in the form of a sound law. Terrence Kaufman in accepted the basic division into Northern and Southern branches as valid. Other scholars have rejected the genealogical unity of either both nodes or the Northern node alone. Wick R. Miller&#x27;s argument was statistical, arguing that Northern Uto-Aztecan languages displayed too few cognates to be considered a unit. On the other hands he found the number of cognates among Southern Uto-Aztecan languages to suggest a genetic relation. This position was supported by subsequent lexicostatistic analyses by and . Reviewing the debate, considers the evidence in favor of the genetic unity of Northern Uto-Aztecan to be convincing, but remains agnostic on the validity of Southern Uto-Aztecan as a genetic grouping. also considered the north–south split to be valid based on phonological evidence, confirming both groupings. adduced further evidence for the unity of Southern Uto-Aztecan as a valid grouping.

 also rejected the validity of the Takic grouping decomposing it into a Californian areal grouping together with Tubatulabal.

Some classifications have posited a genetic relation between Corachol and Nahuan (e.g. ). Kaufman recognizes similarities between Corachol and Aztecan, but explains them by diffusion instead of genetic evolution. Most scholars view the breakup of Proto-Uto-Aztecan as a case of the gradual disintegration of a dialect continuum.

===Present scheme===
Below is a representation of the internal classification of the language family based on . The classification reflects the decision to split up the previous Taracahitic and Takic groups, that are no longer considered to be valid genetic units. Whether the division between Northern and Southern languages is best understood as geographical or phylogenetic is under discussion. The table contains demographic information about number of speakers and their locations based on data from The Ethnologue. The table also contains links to a selected bibliography of grammars, dictionaries on many of the individual languages.( = extinct)


In addition to the above languages for which linguistic evidence exists, it is suspected that among dozens of now extinct, undocumented or poorly known languages of northern Mexico, many were Uto-Aztecan.

===Extinct languages===
A large number of languages known only from brief mentions are thought to have been Uto-Aztecan languages that became extinct before being documented.

===Proposed external relations===

An &quot;Aztec–Tanoan&quot; macrofamily that unites the Uto-Aztecan languages with the Tanoan languages of the southwestern United States was first proposed by Edward Sapir in the early 20th century, and later supported with potential lexical evidence by other scholars. This proposal has received much criticism about the validity of the proposed cognate sets and has been largely abandoned since the end of the last century as unproven.

<text>Water right in water law is the right of a user to use water from a water source, e.g., a river, stream, pond or source of groundwater. In areas with plentiful water and few users, such systems are generally not complicated or contentious. In other areas, especially arid areas where irrigation is practiced, such systems are often the source of conflict, both legal and physical. Some systems treat surface water and ground water in the same manner, while others use different principles for each.

==Types==
Water rights requires consideration of the context and origin of the right being discussed, or asserted. Traditionally, water rights refers to the utilization of water as an element supporting basic human needs like drinking or irrigation. Water rights could also include the physical occupancy of waterways for purposes of travel, commerce and recreational pursuits. The legal principles and doctrines that form the basis of each type of water rights are not interchangeable and vary according to local and national laws. Therefore, variations among countries and within national subdivisions exist in discussing and acknowledging these rights.

===Utilization of water as an element===
====Based on ownership of the land====
Often, water rights are based on ownership of the land upon which the water rests or flows. For example, under English common law, any rights asserted to &quot;moveable and wandering&quot; water must be based upon rights to the &quot;permanent and immovable&quot; land below.

On streams and rivers, these are referred to as riparian rights or littoral rights, which are protected by property law. Legal principles long recognized under riparian principles involve the right to remove the waterfor drinking or irrigationor to add more water into the channelfor drainage or effluence. Under riparian law, water rights are subject to the test of &quot;reasonable use&quot;. The judiciary has defined &quot;reasonable use&quot; principle as follows: &quot;the true test of the principle and extent of the use is whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not.&quot; Because of the limits on use, the doctrine of riparian rights is often known as the &quot;downstream user rule&quot;the downstream users have rights to the water which the upstream users may not abridge.

====Based on previous use or prior appropriation ====

Where water is more scarce (like in the Western United States), allocation of flowing water is premised upon prior appropriation. &quot;The appropriation doctrine confers upon one who actually diverts and uses water the right to continue to do so provided that the water is used for reasonable and beneficial uses&quot;, regardless of whether that person owns land contiguous to the watercourse. &quot;[A]s between appropriators, the rule of priority is &#x27;first in time, first in right.
The 20th century system of prior appropriation water rights is characterized by five principles:
# Exclusive right is given to the original appropriator, and all following privileges are conditional upon precedent rights.
# All privileges are conditional upon beneficial use.
# Water may be used on riparian lands or non-riparian lands (i.e., water may be used on the land next to the water source, or on land removed from the water source)
# Diversion is permitted, regardless of the shrinkage of the river or stream.
# The privilege may be lost through non-use.

Beneficial use is defined as agricultural, industrial, or urban use. Environmental uses, such as maintaining a body of water and the wildlife that use it, were not initially regarded as beneficial uses in some states but have been accepted in some areas.
Every water right is parameterized by an annual yield and an appropriation date. When a water right is sold, it maintains its original appropriation date.

==== Community-based allocation of water ====
In some jurisdictions, appropriative water rights can be granted directly to communities. Here, water is reserved to provide sufficient capacity for the future growth of that particular community. For example, California provides communities and other water users within watersheds senior status over appropriative (use-based) water rights solely because they are located where the water originates and naturally flows.

A second example of community-based water rights is pueblo water rights. As recognized by California, pueblo water rights are grants to individual settlements (i.e. pueblos) over all streams and rivers flowing through the city and to all groundwater aquifers underlying that particular city. The pueblo&#x27;s claim expands with the needs of the city and may be used to supply the needs of areas that are later annexed to the city. While California recognizes pueblo water rights, pueblo water rights are controversial. Some scholars and courts have argued that the pueblo water rights doctrine lacks a historical basis in Spanish or Mexican water law.

==== Right to clean water ====
Due to humanity&#x27;s dependence upon clean water, many nations, states and municipalities have enacted regulations to preemptively protect water quality and quantity. This right of a government to regulate water quality is premised upon protecting downstream navigable waters from contamination. These waters are publicly owned and include the right to receive these waters undiminished under both the riparian and appropriation doctrines under the Clean Water Act. 

===The right to access and physically occupy water===
The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate and occupy &quot;navigable waters&quot;; this is referred to as a navigable servitude. Congress has exercised this power in a variety of ways, including the construction of dams, diverting water from a stream and blocking and restricting use of waterways. The servitude is a Federal power, not an individual right.

Public trust rights to access and recreate upon navigable-in-fact waters may also exist. These rights are often based on local laws over property held in trust for the public. In the United States, each state holds the land submerged by navigable waters in trust for the public and can establish a public right to access or recreate within these public waterways. Again, this &quot;water right&quot; is not an individual right, but rather a public right and individual privilege which may include restrictions and limitations based on local laws.

The Fifth and Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution limit the power of state or federal governments to impinge upon any exclusive use of water by prohibiting the enactment of any laws or regulations that amount to a &quot;taking&quot; of private property. Laws and regulations that deprive a riparian owner of legally cognizable water rights constitute an illegal governmental taking of private property for which just compensation is owed to the water right holder.

==History==
In ancient Rome, the law was that people could obtain temporary usufructuary rights for running water. These rights were independent of land ownership, and lasted as long as use continued. 

Under English common law, all tidal waters were held by the Crown and all freshwater streams were included with title to the lands, with full accompanying rights. However, under the riparian doctrine, landowners had the right to receive water undiminished by upstream landowners.

Over time, rights evolved from being strictly land-based to also include use-based, allowing non-landowners to hold enforceable rights to receive clean water. A reasonable use rule evolved in some countries.

==Finland ==
In Finland, waterbodies are generally privately owned, but Finland also applies the Roman law principle of &quot;aqua profluens&quot; (flowing water), according to which the freely flowing water in waterbodies cannot be owned or possessed. This means that the owners of waterbodies cannot prohibit diversion of water for agricultural, industrial, municipal, or domestic use according to the provisions of the Finnish Water Law. A separate act regulates provision of water. There also exists public easement over rivers.

<text>William Robert Anderson (June 17, 1921 – February 25, 2007) was an officer in the United States Navy, and a U.S. Representative from Tennessee from 1965 to 1973.

==Early life and naval career==
Anderson was born in Humphreys County, Tennessee in the rural community of Bakerville, south of Waverly. He attended primary school in Waynesboro, Tennessee where his father ran a sawmill. He graduated from the former Columbia Military Academy in Columbia, Tennessee in 1939, and from the United States Naval Academy in 1942.

Anderson&#x27;s service in World War II was distinguished. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and participated in a total of eleven combat submarine patrols.

==USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;==
Anderson was selected by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to be the second commanding officer of the first nuclear submarine to be placed into service, the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; and was its commander from 1957 to 1959. Anderson and his crew received international notice when the &quot;Nautilus&quot; became the first submarine to sail successfully under the polar ice cap surrounding the North Pole.

That transit was completed under direct orders of President Dwight Eisenhower, under extreme secrecy and was in direct response to the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the Russians. The president felt that such a display of technological and military capability would offset the advantage won by the Soviets with Sputnik. The voyage by Anderson and his crew led the way for other submarine exploration beneath the ice cap and gave a decided military advantage to the US. Anderson received the Legion of Merit from Eisenhower for leading his crew and ship on the historic mission.

After completing his tour as commander of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, Anderson became an assistant to Admiral Rickover. He was promoted to the rank of captain at the relatively young age of 39 in 1960. He retired from the Navy shortly thereafter to pursue a career in politics.

==Author==
He wrote a 1959 book about his journey under the North Pole, &quot;Nautilus 90 North&quot;, co-written with Clay Blair Jr. An updated and more complete book about the North Pole transit, &quot;The Ice Diaries&quot;, with co-author Don Keith, was completed just before Anderson&#x27;s death. The book features previously classified information and many details that were not available for the first book.

He was awarded, in 1959, the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London &quot;for his services to Arctic exploration&quot;.

==Political career==
Upon retiring from the Navy, Anderson entered politics. He mounted an independent campaign for governor of Tennessee in 1962, finishing second to former Democratic governor Frank G. Clement.

In 1964, Anderson entered the Democratic primary to replace Sixth District Representative Ross Bass, who was running for the United States Senate to finish the term of the late Estes Kefauver, and he won both the nomination and the subsequent general election. Anderson was re-elected three times.

Anderson proved to be somewhat more liberal than expected for a naval veteran representing a largely-rural district in western and central Tennessee. In fact, in the Tennessee congressional delegation of that time, only Richard Fulton of the neighboring 5th District (Nashville) had a more liberal voting record. Anderson voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1968. After touring South Vietnam June 1970, Anderson and fellow Democratic Representative Augustus F. Hawkins drafted a House Resolution urging Congress to &quot;condemn the cruel and inhumane treatment&quot; of prisoners in South Vietnam. Anderson and Hawkins had visited South Vietnam with nine other representatives, but they were the only two to visit a civilian South Vietnamese prison on Con Son Island, which they described as being akin to &quot;tiger cages&quot;. The two representatives also pressured President Nixon to send an independent task force to investigate the prison and &quot;prevent further degradation and death&quot;.

Anderson was well regarded in some Democratic circles and was sometimes mentioned as potentially having a bright future, some even suggesting him as a potential vice presidential nominee in 1972 based largely upon his military record. However, Anderson&#x27;s independent gubernatorial race and his progressive tendencies had not been forgotten by many of his fellow Democrats, particularly in the General Assembly. Tennessee was slated to lose a district as a result of reapportionment following the 1970 census, and Anderson&#x27;s district was considerably reconfigured prior to the 1972 elections. Anderson&#x27;s district received a large area around Memphis, where Republican influence was strong and growing and simultaneously lost some solidly Democratic areas.

Observers felt that if there was a vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the Tennessee congressional delegation in 1972, it was probably Anderson. That came to pass in the Republican landslide of 1972, in which President Nixon carried 49 of 50 states and 90 of Tennessee&#x27;s 95 counties, and Anderson lost to Republican state personnel commissioner Robin Beard by 12 percent. Since then, the district, renumbered the Seventh District in 1983, has become the state&#x27;s most Republican region outside of East Tennessee, and Democrats have made only three subsequent serious bids for the seat as of 2016.

Anderson retired from public life. He served as an officer with the Public Office Corporation, and lived in Alexandria, Virginia. He died from kidney failure after living in Leesburg, Virginia during the final years of his life.

After leaving office, Anderson had played a key role in automating the administrative procedures in the constituent offices of the House of Representatives. His son, William, was the classic &quot;early adopter&quot; of mini-computer technology, the DEC PDP-11/70 specifically, and the two of them helped establish a timesharing company that offered members of Congress an opportunity to improve constituent services. The firm&#x27;s offerings not only improved efficiency but also allowed members to deal efficiently with the tsunami of &quot;interest group&quot; postcards, then flooding the Hill.

He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and his four children, Michael, William, Jane and Thomas Anderson, also known as &quot;Mac&quot;.

==Awards==

William Anderson received the following medals and decorations:

<text>The World Ocean Database Project, or WOD, is a project established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The project leader was Sydney Levitus, who was also director of the International Council for Science (ICSU) World Data Center (WDC) for Oceanography, Silver Spring. Sydney Levitus retired in 2013. In recognition of the success of the IOC Global Oceanographic Data Archaeological and Rescue Project (GODAR project), a proposal was presented at the 16th Session of the Committee on International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE), which was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in October–November 2000, to establish the World Ocean Database Project. This project is intended to stimulate international exchange of modern oceanographic data and encourage the development of regional oceanographic databases as well as the implementation of regional quality control procedures. This new Project was endorsed by the IODE at the conclusion of the Portugal meeting, and the IOC subsequently approved this project in June 2001.

The World Ocean Database represents the world&#x27;s largest collection of ocean profile-plankton data available internationally without restriction. Data comes from the: (a) Sixty-five National Oceanographic Data Centers and nine Designated National Agencies (DNAs) (in Croatia, Finland, Georgia, Malaysia, Romania, Senegal, Sweden, Tanzania, and Ukraine), (b) International Ocean Observing Projects such as the completed World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), as well as currently active programs such as CLIVAR and Argo, (c) International Ocean Data Management Projects such as the IOC/IODE Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue Project (GODAR), and (d) Real-time Ocean Observing Systems such as the IOC/IODE Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Project (GTSPP). All ocean data acquired by WDC Silver Spring – USA are considered as part of the WDC archive and are freely available as public domain data.

==Comparison of World Ocean Databases==
The World Ocean Database was first released in 1994 and updates have been released approximately every four years, 1998, 2001, and 2005. The most recent World Ocean Database series, WOD09, was released in September 2009. The WOD09 has more than 9 million temperature profiles and 3.6 million salinity profiles. The table shows a comparison of the number of stations by instrument type in WOD09 with previous NODC/WDC global ocean databases.

==Instrument Types==

Ocean profile, plankton data, and metadata are available in the World Ocean Database for
29 depth-dependent variables (physical and biochemical) and 11 instruments types: Ocean Station Data (OSD), Mechanical Bathythermograph (MBT), Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT), Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD), Undulating Oceanographic Recorder (UOR), Profiling Float (PFL), Moored Buoy (MRB), Drifting Buoy (DRB), Gliders (GLD), Autonomous Pinniped Bathythermograph (APB).

==Word Ocean Database Products==

The data in the World Ocean Database are made available through the online search and retrieval system known as WOD&quot;select&quot;. The World Ocean Atlas (WOA&quot;select&quot;) series is a set of gridded (1° grid), climatological, objectively analyzed fields of the variables in the World Ocean Database. The WOA&quot;select&quot; is a selection tool by which the user can designate a geographic area, depth, and oceanographic variable to view climatological means or related statistics for a given variable at the requested depth for the requested geographic area.

<doc id="1137938" wikidata="Q1354497" url="?curid=1137938" title="World Peace Council">
<text>The World Peace Council (WPC) is an international organization created in 1949 by the Cominform and propped up by the Soviet Union. Throughout the Cold War, WPC engaged in propaganda efforts on behalf of the Soviet Union, whereby it criticized the United States and its allies while defending the Soviet Union&#x27;s involvement in numerous conflicts. 

The organization had the stated goals of advocating for universal disarmament, sovereignty, independence, peaceful co-existence, and campaigns against imperialism, weapons of mass destruction and all forms of discrimination. The organization&#x27;s propagandizing for the USSR led to the decline of its influence over the peace movement in non-Communist countries. 

Its first president was the French physicist and activist Frédéric Joliot-Curie. It was based in Helsinki, Finland, from 1968 to 1999, and since in Athens, Greece.

==History==

===Origins===
In August 1948 through the initiative of the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) a &quot;World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace&quot; was held in Wrocław, Poland.

This gathering established a permanent organisation called the International Liaison Committee of Intellectuals for Peace—a group which joined with another international Communist organisation, the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation to convene a second international conclave in Paris in April 1949, a meeting designated the World Congress of Partisans for Peace (Congrès Mondial des Partisans de la Paix). Some 2,000 delegates from 75 countries were in attendance at this foundation gathering in the French capital.

A new permanent organization emerged from the April 1949 conclave, the World Committee of Partisans for Peace. At a Second World Congress held in Warsaw in November 1950, this group adopted the new name World Peace Council (WPC). The origins of the WPC lay in the Cominform&#x27;s doctrine that the world was divided between &quot;peace-loving&quot; progressive forces led by the Soviet Union and &quot;warmongering&quot; capitalist countries led by the United States, declaring that peace &quot;should now become the pivot of the entire activity of the Communist Parties&quot;, and most western Communist parties followed this policy.

In 1950, Cominform adopted the report of Mikhail Suslov, a senior Soviet official, praising the Partisans for Peace and resolving that, &quot;The Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties must utilize all means of struggle to secure a stable and lasting peace, subordinating their entire activity to this&quot; and that &quot;Particular attention should be devoted to drawing into the peace movement trade unions, women&#x27;s, youth, cooperative, sport, cultural, education, religious and other organizations, and also scientists, writers, journalists, cultural workers, parliamentary and other political and public leaders who act in defense of peace and against war.&quot;

Lawrence Wittner, a historian of the post-war peace movement, argues that the Soviet Union devoted great efforts to the promotion of the WPC in the early post-war years because it feared an American attack and American superiority of arms at a time when the US possessed the atom bomb but the Soviet Union had not yet developed it. This was in opposition to the theory that America had no plans to attack anyone, and the purpose of the WPC was to disarm the US and the NATO alliance for a future Soviet attack.

====Wrocław 1948 and New York 1949====

The World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace met in Wrocław on 6 August 1948. Julian Huxley, the chair of UNESCO, chaired the meeting in the hope of bridging Cold War divisions, but later wrote that &quot;there was no discussion in the ordinary sense of the word.&quot; Speakers delivered lengthy condemnation of the West and praises of the Soviet Union. Albert Einstein had been invited to send an address, but when the organisers found that it advocated world government and that his representative refused to change it, they substituted another document by Einstein without his consent, leaving Einstein feeling that he had been badly used.

The Congress elected a permanent International Committee of Intellectuals in Defence of Peace (also known as the International Committee of Intellectuals for Peace and the International Liaison Committee of Intellectuals for Peace) with headquarters in Paris. It called for the establishment of national branches and national meetings along the same lines as the World Congress. In accordance with this policy, a Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace was held in New York City in March 1949 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, sponsored by the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions.

====Paris and Prague 1949====
The World Congress of Partisans for Peace in Paris (20 April 1949) repeated the Cominform line that the world was divided between &quot;a non-aggressive Soviet group and a war-minded imperialistic group, headed by the United States government&quot;. It established a World Committee of Partisans for Peace, led by a twelve-person Executive Bureau and chaired by Professor Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the French Institute. Most of the Executive were Communists. One delegate to the Congress, the Swedish artist , heard no spontaneous contributions or free discussions, only prepared speeches, and described the atmosphere there as &quot;agitated&quot;, &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;warlike&quot;. A speech given at Paris by Paul Robeson—the polyglot lawyer, folksinger, and actor son of a runaway slave—was widely quoted in the American press for stating that African Americans should not and would not fight for the United States in any prospective war against the Soviet Union; following his return, he was subsequently blacklisted and his passport confiscated for years. The Congress was disrupted by the French authorities who refused visas to so many delegates that a simultaneous Congress was held in Prague.&quot; Robeson&#x27;s performance of &quot;The March of the Volunteers&quot; in Prague for the delegation from the incipient People&#x27;s Republic of China was its earliest formal use as the country&#x27;s national anthem. Picasso&#x27;s lithograph, &quot;La Colombe&quot; (The Dove) was chosen as the emblem for the Congress and was subsequently adopted as the symbol of the WPC.

====Sheffield and Warsaw 1950====
In 1950, the World Congress of the Supporters of Peace adopted a permanent constitution for the World Peace Council, which replaced the Committee of Partisans for Peace. The opening congress of the WPC condemned the atom-bomb and the American involvement in the Korean War. The WPC was used by the Soviet Union to promote baseless claims that the United States used biological weapons in the Korean War.

It followed the Cominform line, recommending the creation of national peace committees in every country, and rejected pacifism and the non-aligned peace movement. It was originally scheduled for Sheffield but the British authorities, who wished to undermine the WPC, refused visas to many delegates and the Congress was forced to move to Warsaw. British Prime Minister Clement Attlee denounced the Congress as a &quot;bogus forum of peace with the real aim of sabotaging national defence&quot; and said there would be a &quot;reasonable limit&quot; on foreign delegates. Among those excluded by the government were Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Ilya Ehrenburg, Alexander Fadeyev, and Dmitri Shostakovich. The number of delegates at Sheffield was reduced from an anticipated 2,000 to 500, half of whom were British.

=== 1950s ===

The WPC was directed by the International Department of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party through the Soviet Peace Committee, although it tended not to present itself as an organ of Soviet foreign policy, but rather as the expression of the aspirations of the &quot;peace loving peoples of the world&quot;.

In its early days the WPC attracted numerous &quot;political and intellectual superstars&quot;, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Howard Fast, Pablo Picasso, Louis Aragon, Jorge Amado, Pablo Neruda, György Lukacs, Renato Guttuso, Jean-Paul Sartre, Diego Rivera, Muhammad al-Ashmar and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Most were Communists or fellow travellers.

In the 1950s, congresses were held in Vienna, Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm. The January 1952 World Congress of People in Vienna represented Joseph Stalin&#x27;s strategy of peaceful coexistence, resulting in a more broad-based conference. Among those attending were Jean-Paul Sartre and Hervé Bazin. In 1955, another WPC meeting in Vienna launched an &quot;Appeal against the Preparations for Nuclear War&quot;, with grandiose claims about its success.

Following the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, the WPC convened a conference in Helsinki in December 1956. Although there were reportedly &quot;serious differences&quot; regarding the Hungarian situation within both the WPC and national peace movements, the conference passed a unanimous resolution blaming the Hungarian government for the Soviet invasion, citing &quot;the faults of an internal regime as well as their exploitation by foreign propagandists&quot;. The resolution also called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the restoration of Hungarian sovereignty.

The WPC led the international peace movement in the decade after the Second World War, but its failure to speak out against the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and the resumption of Soviet nuclear tests in 1961 marginalised it, and in the 1960s it was eclipsed by the newer, non-aligned peace organizations like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. At first, Communists denounced the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament for &quot;splitting the peace movement&quot; but they were compelled to join it when they saw how popular it was.

===1960s===
Throughout much of the 1960s and early 1970s, the WPC campaigned against the US&#x27;s role in the Vietnam War. Opposition to the Vietnam War was widespread in the mid-1960s and most of the anti-war activity had nothing to do with the WPC, which decided, under the leadership of J. D. Bernal, to take a softer line with non-aligned peace groups in order to secure their co-operation. In particular, Bernal believed that the WPC&#x27;s influence with these groups was jeopardized by China&#x27;s insistence that the WPC give unequivocal support to North Vietnam in the war.

In 1968, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia occasioned unprecedented dissent from Soviet policy within the WPC. It brought about such a crisis in the Secretariat that in September that year only one delegate supported the invasion. However, the Soviet Union soon reasserted control, and according to the US State Department, &quot;The WPC&#x27;s eighth world assembly in East Berlin in June 1969 was widely criticized by various participants for its lack of spontaneity and carefully orchestrated Soviet supervision. As the British General Secretary of the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace and a delegate to the 1969 assembly wrote (&quot;Tribune&quot;, 4 July 1969): &#x27;There were a number [of delegates] who decided to vote against the general resolution for three reasons (a) it was platitudinous (b) it was one sided and (c) in protest against restrictions on minorities and the press within the assembly. This proved impossible in the end for no vote was taken.&#x27;&quot;

===Activities===

Until the late 1980s, the World Peace Council&#x27;s principal activity was the organization of large international congresses, nearly all of which had over 2,000 delegates representing most of the countries of the world. Most of the delegates came from pro-Communist organizations, with some observers from non-aligned bodies. There were also meetings of the WPC Assembly, its highest governing body. The congresses and assemblies issued statements, appeals and resolutions that called for world peace in general terms and condemned US weapons policy, invasions and military actions. The US Department of State described the congresses as follows: &quot;The majority of participants in the assemblies are Soviet and East European communist party members, representatives of foreign communist parties, and representatives of other Soviet-backed international fronts. Token noncommunist participation serves to lend an element of credibility. Discussion usually is confined to the inequities of Western socioeconomic systems and attacks on the military and foreign policies of the United States and other imperialist, fascist nations. Resolutions advocating policies favored by the U.S.S.R. and other communist nations are passed by acclamation, not by vote. In most cases, delegates do not see the texts until they are published in the communist media. Attempts by noncommunist delegates to discuss Soviet actions (such as the invasion of Afghanistan) are dismissed as interference in internal affairs or anti-Soviet propaganda. Dissent among delegates often is suppressed and never acknowledged in final resolutions or communiques. All assemblies praise the U.S.S.R. and other progressive societies and endorse Soviet foreign policy positions.&quot;

The WPC was involved in demonstrations and protests especially in areas bordering US military installations in Western Europe believed to house nuclear weapons. It campaigned against US-led military operations, especially the Vietnam War, although it did not condemn similar Soviet actions in Hungary and in Afghanistan.

On 18 March 1950, the WPC launched its Stockholm Appeal at a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress, calling for the absolute prohibition of nuclear weapons. The campaign won popular support, collecting, it is said, 560 million signatures in Europe, most from socialist countries, including 10 million in France (including that of the young Jacques Chirac), and 155 million signatures in the Soviet Union – the entire adult population. Several non-aligned peace groups who had distanced themselves from the WPC advised their supporters not to sign the Appeal.

In June 1975 the WPC launched a second Stockholm Appeal during a period of détente between East and West. It declared that, &quot;The victories of peace and détente have created a new international climate, new hopes, new confidence, new optimism among the peoples.&quot;

In the 1980s it campaigned against the deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe.

It published two magazines, &quot;New Perspectives&quot; and &quot;Peace Courier&quot;. Its current magazine is &quot;Peace Messenger&quot;.

===Associated groups===
In accordance with the Comniform&#x27;s 1950 resolution to draw into the peace movement trade unions, women&#x27;s and youth organisations, scientists, writers and journalists, etc., several Communist mass organisations supported the WPC, for example:

* Christian Peace Conference
* International Federation of Resistance Fighters
* International Institute for Peace
* International Association of Democratic Lawyers
* International Organization of Journalists
* International Union of Students
* World Federation of Democratic Youth
* World Federation of Scientific Workers
* World Federation of Trade Unions
* Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation

===Relations with non-aligned peace groups===
The WPC has been described as caught in contradictions as &quot;it sought to become a broad world movement while being instrumentalized increasingly to serve foreign policy in the Soviet Union and nominally socialist countries.&quot; From the 1950s until the late 1980s it tried to use non-aligned peace organizations to spread the Soviet point of view, alternately wooing and attacking them, either for their pacifism or their refusal to support the Soviet Union. Until the early 1960s there was limited co-operation between such groups and the WPC, but they gradually dissociated themselves as they discovered it was impossible to criticize the Soviet Union at WPC conferences.

From the late 1940s to the late 1950s the WPC, with its large budget and high-profile conferences, dominated the peace movement, to the extent that the movement became identified with the Communist cause. The formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Britain in 1957 sparked a rapid growth in the unaligned peace movement and its detachment from the WPC. However, the public and some Western leaders still tended to regard all peace activists as Communists. For example, US President Ronald Reagan said that the big peace demonstrations in Europe in 1981 were &quot;all sponsored by a thing called the World Peace Council, which is bought and paid for by the Soviet Union&quot;, and Soviet defector Vladimir Bukovsky claimed that they were co-ordinated at the WPC&#x27;s 1980 World Parliament of Peoples for Peace in Sofia. The FBI reported to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the WPC-affiliated U.S. Peace Council was one of the organizers of a large 1982 peace protest in New York City, but said that the KGB had not manipulated the American movement &quot;significantly.&quot; International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War was said to have had &quot;overlapping membership and similar policies&quot; to the WPC. and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and the Dartmouth Conferences were said to have been used by Soviet delegates to promote Soviet propaganda. Joseph Rotblat, one of the leaders of the Pugwash movement, said that although a few participants in Pugwash conferences from the Soviet Union &quot;were obviously sent to push the party line ... the majority were genuine scientists and behaved as such&quot;.

As the non-aligned peace movement &quot;was constantly under threat of being tarnished by association with avowedly pro-Soviet groups&quot;, many individuals and organizations &quot;studiously avoided contact with Communists and fellow-travellers.&quot; Some western delegates walked out of the Wrocław conference of 1948, and in 1949 the World Pacifist Meeting warned against active collaboration with Communists. In the same year, several members of the British Peace Pledge Union, including Vera Brittain, Michael Tippett, and Sybil Morrison, criticised the WPC-affiliated British Peace Committee for what they saw as its &quot;unquestioning hero-worship&quot; of the Soviet Union. In 1950, several Swedish peace organizations warned their supporters against signing the WPC&#x27;s Stockholm Appeal. In 1953, the International Liaison Committee of Organizations for Peace stated that it had &quot;no association with the World Peace Council&quot;. In 1956, a year in which the WPC condemned the Suez war but not the Russian suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the German section of War Resisters International condemned it for its failure to respond to Soviet H-bomb tests. In Sweden, Aktionsgruppen Mot Svensk Atombomb discouraged its members from participating in Communist-led peace committees. The WPC attempted to co-opt the eminent peace campaigner Bertrand Russell, much to his annoyance, and in 1957 he refused the award of the WPC&#x27;s International Peace Prize. In Britain, CND advised local groups in 1958 not to participate in a forthcoming WPC conference. In the US, SANE rejected WPC appeals for co-operation. A final break occurred during the WPC&#x27;s 1962 World Congress for Peace and Disarmament in Moscow. The WPC had invited non-aligned peace groups, who were permitted to criticize Soviet nuclear testing, but when western activists including the British Committee of 100 tried to demonstrate in Red Square against Soviet weapons and the Communist system, their banners were confiscated and they were threatened with deportation. As a result of this confrontation, 40 non-aligned organizations decided to form a new international body, the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace, which was not to have Soviet members.

From about 1982, following the proclamation of martial law in Poland, the Soviet Union adopted a harder line with non-aligned groups, apparently because their failure to prevent the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles. In December 1982, the Soviet Peace Committee President, Yuri Zhukov, returning to the rhetoric of the mid-1950s, wrote to several hundred non-communist peace groups in Western Europe accusing the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation of &quot;fueling the cold war by claiming that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact bear equal responsibility for the arms race and international tension. Zhukov denounced the West Berlin Working Group for a Nuclear-Free Europe, organizers of a May 1983 European disarmament conference in Berlin, for allegedly siding with NATO, attempting to split the peace movement, and distracting the peaceloving public from the main source of the deadly threat posed against the peoples of Europe-the plans for stationing a new generation of nuclear missiles in Europe in 1983.&quot; In 1983, the British peace campaigner E. P. Thompson, a leader of European Nuclear Disarmament, attended the World Peace Council&#x27;s World Assembly for Peace and Life Against Nuclear War in Prague at the suggestion of the Czech dissident group Charter 77 and raised the issue of democracy and civil liberties in the Communist states, only for Assembly to respond by loudly applauding a delegate who said that &quot;the so-called dissident issue was not a matter for the international peace movement, but something that had been injected into it artificially by anti-communists.&quot; The Hungarian student peace group, Dialogue, also tried to attend the 1983 Assembly but were met with tear gas, arrests, and deportation to Hungary; the following year the authorities banned it.

Rainer Santi, in his history of the International Peace Bureau, said that the WPC &quot;always had difficulty in securing cooperation from West European and North American peace organisations because of its obvious affiliation with Socialist countries and the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. Especially difficult to digest, was that instead of criticising the Soviet Union&#x27;s unilaterally resumed atmospheric nuclear testing in 1961, the WPC issued a statement rationalizing it. In 1979 the World Peace Council explained the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as an act of solidarity in the face of Chinese and US aggression against Afghanistan.&quot; Rob Prince, a former secretary of the WPC, suggested that it simply failed to connect with the western peace movement because it used most of its funds on international travel and lavish conferences. It had poor intelligence on Western peace groups, and, even though its HQ was in Helsinki, had no contact with Finnish peace organizations.

===After the demise of the Soviet Union===
By the mid-1980s the Soviet Peace Committee &quot;concluded that the WPC was a politically expendable and spent force&quot;, although it continued to provide funds until 1991. As the Soviet Peace Committee was the conduit for Soviet direction of the WPC, this judgement represented a downgrading of the WPC by the Soviet Communist Party. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Peace Committee developed bilateral international contacts &quot;in which the WPC not only played no role, but was a liability.&quot; Gorbachev never even met WPC President Romesh Chandra and excluded him from many Moscow international forums. Following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, the WPC lost most of its support, income and staff and dwindled to a small core group. Its international conferences now attract only a tenth of the delegates that its Soviet-backed conferences could attract (see below), although it still issues statements couched in similar terms to those of its historic appeals.

===Location===
The WPC first set up its offices in Paris, but was accused by the French government of engaging in &quot;fifth column&quot; activities and was expelled in 1952. It moved to Prague and then to Vienna. In 1957 it was banned by the Austrian government. It was invited to Prague but did not move there, had no official HQ but continued to operate in Vienna under cover of the International Institute for Peace. In 1968 it re-assumed its name and moved to Helsinki, Finland, where it remained until 1999. In 2000 it re-located to Athens, Greece.

===Funding===

The WPC was receiving financial contributions from friendly countries and from the Soviet Peace Committee during its history until 1991. After the year 2000 and the shifting of the Head office to Athens, its current finances derive exclusively from Membership Fees and contributions/donations by members and friends, based on the rules and regulations adopted in 2008, during the 19th Assembly of the WPC held in Caracas/Venezuela. The executive committee and Assemblies receive financial reports on income and expenses.

===Allegations of CIA measures against the WPC===
The Congress for Cultural Freedom was founded in 1950 with the support of the CIA to counter the propaganda of the emerging WPC, and Phillip Agee claimed that the WPC was a Soviet front for propaganda which CIA covertly tried to neutralize and to prevent the WPC from organizing outside the Communist bloc.

==Current organisation==
The WPC currently states its goals as: Actions against imperialist wars and occupation of sovereign countries and nations;
prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction; abolition of foreign military bases; universal disarmament under effective international control; elimination of all forms of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination; respect for the right of peoples to sovereignty and independence, essential for the establishment of peace; non-interference in the internal affairs of nations; peaceful co-existence between states with different political systems; negotiations instead of use of force in the settlement of differences between nations.

The WPC is a registered NGO at the United Nations and co-operates primarily with the Non-Aligned Movement. It cooperates with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), International Labour Organization (ILO), and other UN specialized agencies, special committees and departments. It is said to have successfully influenced their agendas, the terms of discussion and the orientations of their resolutions. It also cooperates with the African Union, the League of Arab States, and other inter-governmental bodies.

<text>Xuē Xīnrán (, pen name &quot;Xinran&quot;, born in Beijing in 1958) is a British-Chinese journalist, author, speaker, and advocate for women&#x27;s issues.
She was a popular radio personality in China with a call-in program named &quot;Words on the Night Breeze&quot; from 1989 to 1997. The program focused on women&#x27;s issues and life stories. She was well known for travelling extensively in China to interview women for her work. In 1997, she moved to London and began writing stories of the women she met along her journeys. Her first book, &quot;The Good Women of China&quot;, was published in 2002, becoming an international bestseller. She frequently contributes to The Guardian and the BBC.

==Education==
First Military University of People&#x27;s Liberation Army, 1983–1987; English and International Relations

==Personal life==
Xinran was born into a wealthy and privileged family on 19 July 1958. She was raised by her grandparents due to her parents&#x27; imprisonment during China&#x27;s cultural revolution. She has said that her first memory was of the Red Guards setting her home on fire when she was 6 years old.

Xinran was married, while working as an army administrator, and has one son, Panpan, who was born in 1988. She later divorced. She moved to London in 1997 and married British literary agent Toby Eady (son of Mary Wesley) in 2002.

==Books==
The Good Women of China, was published in 2002 and related many of the stories she heard on her radio show. It has since been translated into over thirty languages.

Sky Burial, Xinran’s second book, was published in 2004. It told the incredible true story of Shu Wen, whose husband joined the Chinese army only a few months after their marriage in the 1950s, and was sent to Tibet to try and unify the two cultures.

What the Chinese Don&#x27;t Eat, a collection of Xinran’s Guardian columns from 2003 to 2005, was published in 2006. It covers a vast range of topics, from food to sex education, from the experiences of British mothers who have adopted Chinese daughters to whether Chinese people do Christmas shopping.

Miss Chopsticks, Xinran’s first novel, was published in July 2007. It explores the uneasy relationship between Chinese migrant workers and the cities they flock to, and how the country’s economic reforms have changed the role of so-called ‘chopstick girls’. Once considered disposable, they now take city jobs as waitresses, masseuses, factory line workers and cleaners, and bring bundles of cash home. This earns them respect in their patriarchal villages, as well as the respect and hearts of city dwellers.

China Witness, Xinran’s fifth book, was published in October 2008. It is based on twenty years’ worth of interviews she conducted with the last two generations in China. She hopes it will ‘restore a real modern history of China, from real people after most historical evidence was destroyed in the Culture Revolution’. 

Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother, Xinran’s Sixth book, was published in 2010. It is a collection of heartbreaking stories from Chinese mothers who have lost their children, or been forced to abandon them.

Buy Me the Sky, Xinran’s seventh book, contains stories from the first generation of China’s one child policy. It was published in the UK in May 2015, and in other countries in 2016.

The Promise, Xinran’s eighth book, was published in 2019. The story tells the romantic journeys of four generations within one Chinese family, spanning a century marked by profound social change. It is dedicated to the Xinran’s beloved husband Toby Eady, the renowned literary agent, who succumbed to bladder cancer on December 24 2017, after a brave three-year battle.

Still Hot a collection of surprising, affecting, funny and emotional stories about forty-two women, including Xinran, who share their very personal stories of the menopause. It was published in 2020. 

Barefoot Books Water is a collection of stories, published in 2021, told by a friendly water droplet, guiding children through topics ranging from melting and freezing to the ways in which water literally shapes the Earth. These stories are told by storytellers from around the world, including Xinran.

The Book of Secrets, Xinran’s ninth book, was published by Bloomsbury in February 2024. It tells the incredible story of a Chinese man through the secret letters he left to his wife and daughter, providing unique insight into the history of war, love, deceit, betrayal and political intrigue in China over the past century. 

China Adorned was first conceived by Toby Eady in 2009. From 2009 to 2014, Xinran and Toby led a team in seeking out an author and a photographer with the necessary expertise and experience. In 2018, Chinese anthropologist Deng Qiyao became attached to the project and began writing the text, which was translated into English by Will Spence and Fan Wu. From 2019-2022, the book was brought together and designed by publishers Thames &amp; Hudson in Australia/UK and Yilin Press in China, with Xinran serving as Executive Editor. The book, the first ever Chinese-English bilingual picture book on Chinese ethnic minorities, was published in 2022.

==Other==
In August 2004 Xinran set up ‘The Mothers’ Bridge of Love’ (MBL). MBL reaches out to Chinese children in all corners of the world; by creating a bridge of understanding between China and the West and between adoptive culture and birth culture, MBL ultimately wants to help bridge the huge poverty gap which still exists in many parts of China.
The MBL book for adoptive families, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Bridge of Love&quot;, came third in TIME magazine’s list of the top ten children’s books of 2007.

Xinran often advises western media (including BBC and Sky) about western relations with China, and makes frequent television and radio appearances. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Asia House Festival of Asian Literature.

<text>Yusuf Kironde Lule (10 April 1912 – 21 January 1985) was a Ugandan professor and politician who served as the fourth president of Uganda between 13 April and 20 June 1979.

==Early life==
Yusuf Lule was born on 10 April 1912 in Kampala. He was educated at King&#x27;s College Budo (1929–34), Makerere University College, Kampala (1934–36), Fort Hare University at Alice, South Africa (1936–39) and the University of Edinburgh. Initially a Muslim, he converted to Christianity while at King&#x27;s College Budo.

In 1947 Lule married Hannah Namuli Wamala at Kings College Budo&#x27;s church, where he was a teacher and she was head girl.

In 1959 the Democratic Party (DP) nominated Lule as a candidate to become Kattikiro (Prime Minister) of the subnational kingdom of Buganda. Many aristocratic figures in the kingdom distrusted or otherwise did not support Lule because of his Muslim origins despite his conversion to Christianity, and Michael Kintu ultimately won the election. Upon Uganda&#x27;s independence in 1962, he became chairman of the Public Service Commission.

Lule served as the first black principal of Makerere University College from 1964 to 1970, and was assistant secretary-general of the Association of African Universities, in Accra, Ghana, between 1973 and 1978. Lule served as a minister in the pre-independence British colonial government and later as an assistant secretary-general of the Commonwealth Secretariat. He went into exile after Idi Amin came to power.

== Chairman of the Uganda National Liberation Front ==
Following the outbreak of the Uganda–Tanzania War, Ugandan rebels and exiles began making preparations for the establishment of a new government to follow Idi Amin&#x27;s regime. After the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force (TPDF) had captured substantial territory, President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania ordered it to halt to give time for the Ugandan rebels to convene and reorganise. The Ugandan rebels made due preparations, primarily led by former president Milton Obote and leftist intellectual Dani Wadada Nabudere in their own respective circles. As the Tanzanians began organising a conference for the rebels and exiles, Nyerere was reconsidering Obote&#x27;s role in the movement. He did not want to give the impression that Tanzania was going to install a government of its own choice in Uganda by facilitating Obote&#x27;s assumption of leadership of the rebel movement, and there was hostility to Obote from the Baganda people in southern Uganda as well as other countries such as Kenya. Nyerere also feared that Obote would stifle cooperation at the meeting and cause it to break up without success. He ultimately convinced Obote to refrain from attending. In place of Obote, many Ugandan exiles began favouring Lule, who was a Muganda and had the reputation of being a political moderate as well as a civil servant who was not tarnished by scandal or corrupt service in a past Ugandan regime.

The Moshi Conference opened on 24 March 1979 in the Tanzanian town of Moshi, following an intense debate over which factions and persons could be admitted. That afternoon the delegates announced the formation of the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF), which was to be governed by a 30-strong National Consultative Committee (NCC) and an 11-strong National Executive Committee, the latter including three special commissions—Finance and Administration, Political and Diplomatic Affairs, and Military Affairs. The next two days were spent debating the balance of power among the governing bodies and the selection of a chairman for the organisation, which was hotly contested between Lule and Paulo Muwanga, an Obote supporter. After heated argument a consensus was reached whereby Lule would be given the chair and Muwanga would be made head of the Military Affairs Commission.

==President of Uganda==
=== Inauguration ===
Caught unprepared by the fall of Kampala, Lule hurriedly compiled a list of ministers meant to represent the ethnic balances of Uganda&#x27;s population. On 12 April 1979 Lule and his cabinet boarded a flight from Dar es Salaam to Entebbe to fly in for his inauguration. While the plane was stopped in Mwanza, Tanzanian officials decided to delay it there until they could ensure better security for a ceremony in Kampala. The next day Lule and his ministers reached Entebbe and were brought into Kampala in a TPDF motorcade in the late afternoon. Lule was then sworn in as President of Uganda in front of the Parliament building and gave a brief speech pledging to bring a return of law and order. Lule concluded by saying in Luganda, &quot;Now it is our turn.&quot; Still feeling that Kampala was unsafe, Tanzanian officials quickly took Lule from Parliament and installed him in the Entebbe State House.

=== Tenure ===
Lule assumed office at a time when Uganda&#x27;s national institutions were dysfunctional and the country was plagued by lawlessness and violence; he presided over a failed state. Lule disregarded the Moshi Conference agreements stipulating a weak presidential authority and attempted to assert his ability to operate under stronger powers provided by the constitution operative in Uganda before Amin&#x27;s coup. Within days of assuming office Lule and his advisers began taking major decisions without consulting the NCC. He also snubbed the committee members by first missing their formal inauguration and, when the ceremony was rescheduled so he could be present, he gave a speech and departed before swearing them in, much to their displeasure. Lule then appointed ministers and deputy ministers to his cabinet without the NCC&#x27;s approval. The members of the cabinet joined the NCC &quot;ex officio&quot;, and he ultimately appointed 24 ministers and 20 deputies, which then outnumbered the original councilors. Despite complaints from the NCC, Lule carried on making appointments and revising the structure of his cabinet. He also declared a reorganization of Ugandan&#x27;s administration, dividing the country into four regions each subject to the authority of a regional commissioner.

Lule further infuriated the NCC when his cabinet awarded its own members $5,000 worth of foreign exchange as a &quot;rehabilitation allowance&quot; despite the treasury having very little money. Lule responded to the councilors&#x27; anger by offering them the same allowance, which they rejected. He also distrusted the UNLA, which he considered to be made up of loyal Obote and Yoweri Museveni partisans. Lule&#x27;s government withheld money to the army for this reason, and it played no role in overseeing the defeat of the remnants of Amin&#x27;s forces. He planned on disbanding the UNLA and replacing it with a new &quot;National Army&quot;, which angered the leaders of the former. The army was to be proportionately representative of all of Uganda&#x27;s regions and stipulate education requirements for applicants.

Lule secured a £100 million aid programme from Western countries, alienating leftists who feared he would sellout the country to international business interests. His government&#x27;s efforts to stifle inflation and curb the black market were minimal and unsuccessful, and during his tenure the economic situation of Uganda continued its decline from Amin&#x27;s rule.

Many Baganda were elated by Lule&#x27;s elevation to the presidency, hoping that he would preserve the Buganda region&#x27;s interests and keep Obote from returning to power. Lule ultimately did take measures that pleased the Baganda, such as restoring administrative unity to Buganda, conferring more powers upon Buganda&#x27;s government, frequently delivering public statements in Luganda, appointing prominent Baganda monarchists to high office, and granting some state contracts to Baganda businessmen. In redistributing properties and enterprises seized from Amin&#x27;s associates, Lule&#x27;s government allocated a disproportionate amount to Baganda and his close associates. Members of other ethnic groups in Uganda did not trust Lule or accord him much respect, since they felt he would promote Buganda at other regions&#x27; expense. Some Ugandans feared that his army plan would lead to the creation of a force dominated by Baganda, since Buganda had a larger population than any other region in the country. His critics denounced him as a &quot;monarchist&quot; and a &quot;feudalist&quot;.
=== Demise and removal from office ===
Lule&#x27;s handling of his cabinet provoked outrage in the NCC, especially when he dismissed Muwanga from office. President Nyerere of Tanzania informed Lule that Tanzania would uphold the agreements regarding powers among Ugandan authorities made at Moshi. Lule felt that Tanzania afforded key support to his political opponents, and thus sought to reduce its influence in the country by deprecating the standing of the TPDF, which remained after the elimination of Amin&#x27;s forces to provide order. He encouraged Ugandan publications to criticise the Tanzanian army, angering some Ugandan circles and the UNLA which thought it was unfair to attack the army which had &quot;liberated&quot; the country. On 8 June disgruntled members of the NCC convened in Kampala and passed a resolution demanding Lule present all of his political appointments to the committee for review. Lule did not respond, so on 12 June the NCC reconvened and declared that he had seven days to comply with their demands. The President once again failed to reply, so on the afternoon of 19 June the NCC met at the Entebbe State House in Lule&#x27;s presence. NCC Chairman Edward Rugumayo opened the meeting by reviewing the body&#x27;s unsuccessful entreaties to the President to submit his appointments for its ratification. Lule responded by stating that he was not prepared to take a stance involving such &quot;important constitutional matters&quot; by agreeing to submit the appointments to the NCC. He also said that his cabinet appointments were publicly known and that the committee could &quot;treat the appointments as you wish&quot;.

Lule&#x27;s statement was followed by hours of debate by the NCC concerning the division of powers agreed upon in Moshi. Later, Lule rose to say that he had not contravened the agreements made in Moshi and said that he had not received key directives supposedly dispatched to him from the NCC. Rugumayo retorted that the communications in question had been personally given to the President&#x27;s secretary. Shortly after the exchange councilor Paulo Wangoola rose and delivered a long speech. He declared that Lule was not willing to accept the supremacy of UNLF governance and concluded by formally tabling a motion of no confidence in the President. This was followed by an intense debate in which different councilors gave impassioned defences and criticisms of Lule. At 1:00 on 20 June the NCC voted on the motion via secret ballot. The results were announced 35 minutes later with 18 councilors voting in favour and 14 against. Lule was thus removed from the presidency, and he walked out of the room with nine other councilors when Rugumayo said that his dismissal also triggered the removal of his cabinet.

Lule held the Ugandan Presidency for just 68 days, the shortest tenure of any President of Uganda. Godfrey Binaisa, the former Attorney General of Uganda under Obote who had come to oppose both him and Amin and had no prior role in the committee, was then elected president. Binaisa retained some of Lule&#x27;s ministers but removed his key supporters from the cabinet and reversed his administrative changes in Buganda.

Many Baganda felt that Lule had been removed from power because he had preserved legitimate interests of Buganda. His ouster instigated large protests in Kampala and clashes between demonstrators and Tanzanian troops attempting to maintain order. Baganda protesters blocked streets and destroyed trucks while transportation workers went on strike and merchants deliberately gouged prices of basic commodities. Some armed Baganda groups formed after Lule&#x27;s departure and attacked police and soldiers, rendering Buganda ungovernable. On 21 October 1980 the Ugandan Court of Appeal ruled that Lule&#x27;s removal had been unlawful, stating that Lule had the authority to appoint ministers without the NCC&#x27;s approval. Though the ruling technically meant Lule could still claim to be President of Uganda, most nationals chose to ignore the decision, since the political situation in the country had rapidly developed since Lule&#x27;s removal.

==Later life==

Out of office, Lule was flown to Tanzania, where he was detained under armed guard before being allowed to fly to London. He later went to Nairobi, Kenya. In 1980 Uganda hosted general elections to elect a new government. In anticipation of the contest, many Baganda began to support the DP as a way of opposing Obote and the UPC. Lule planned to attend the DP&#x27;s conference in June where the party would select its new leaders. The incumbent leadership feared that his Baganda support would propel him to the helm of their organisation and displace them, and thus they blocked his return to Uganda. Despite concerns of fraud and irregularities, the UPC was declared the ultimate winner of the elections and Obote became the President of Uganda. Fearful of Obote&#x27;s grip on power, Lule along with others like Bernard Kibuuka Musoke founded and became head of a rebel group, the Uganda Freedom Fighters (UFF). On 8 June 1981 the UFF merged with Museveni&#x27;s Popular Resistance Army to form the National Resistance Movement (NRM). Lule became chairman of the NRM, while Museveni became its vice-chairman and chairman of the High Command of the National Resistance Army, the group&#x27;s armed wing. The merger greatly strengthened the support of the anti-Obote rebels in Buganda. Lule became a leading critic of Obote and authored a book, &quot;Human Rights Violations in Uganda under Obote&quot;, which was heavily circulated by non-governmental organizations.

Over the last six years of his life Lule received treatment for a kidney disorder at Hammersmith Hospital in London. He died there on 21 January 1985 of kidney failure following surgery. He was buried in London. The NRM released a statement upon his death, stating that it &quot;wishes to assure its members, supporters, sympathizers and all Ugandans that the struggle for which Professor Lule stood will continue.&quot; The NRM ultimately won the Ugandan Bush War, capturing Kampala in January 1986. Following Museveni&#x27;s seizure of power, his government requested that Lule&#x27;s body be repatriated. The remains were disinterred and flown to Entebbe on 22 January 1987. Greeted at the airport by large crowds, Lule&#x27;s body was taken to Kampala where it lay in state for two days before being reburied in Kampala where Uganda&#x27;s first national flag had been raised on its independence day.

== Legacy ==

Historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa described Lule&#x27;s performance in the presidency as &quot;amateurish&quot;.

His son, Wasswa Lule, became an MP for Rubaga North.

<text>Zhang Jiuling () (678 or 673 – 5 June 740), courtesy name Zishou (), nickname Bowu (), formally Count Wenxian of Shixing (), was a Chinese poet and politician of the Tang dynasty, serving as chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong.

== Early life ==
Zhang Jiuling was born in 678, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His family was from Qujiang () in Shao Prefecture (, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong) in the region called Lingnan ), which was at the time a relatively remote area of the Tang empire. His family traced its ancestry to the Jin dynasty (266–420) chancellor Zhang Hua, and his eldest son Zhang Yi (). His great-grandfather Zhang Junzheng () served as the secretary general of Shao Prefecture, and therefore settled there. His grandfather Zhang Zizhou () served as a county magistrate, and his father Zhang Hongyu () served as a county secretary general.

Zhang Jiuling was said to be intelligent in his childhood and capable in literary skills. In 685, when he was 12, he had an occasion to write a letter to Wang Fangqing, then the prefect of Guang Prefecture (, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). Wang was impressed and commented, &quot;This child will do great things in the future.&quot; When the official Zhang Yue was exiled to the region, he met Zhang Jiuling and was impressed, and treated Zhang Jiuling with kindness. Zhang Jiuling later passed the &quot;jinshi&quot; imperial examinations under poet Shen Quanqi and scored the highest on that occasion. After passing several more exams, in 712 he was appointed &quot;zuo shiyi&quot; ().

He was made a &quot;xiaoshu lang&quot; (), a clerk at the imperial institute Hongwen Pavilion (). Later, while Li Longji was crown prince under his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710–712), he summoned those in the empire known for their literary talent and personally examined them. Zhang scored the highest on this occasion as well, and was made &quot;you shiyi&quot; (), a consultant at the legislative bureau of government (, the &quot;zhongshu sheng&quot;).

== During Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign ==
In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. For some time, though, Emperor Xuanzong did not offer sacrifice to heaven and earth outside of the capital Chang&#x27;an, as was customary for emperors. Zhang Jiuling submitted a petition, asking him to carry out such sacrifices, and Emperor Xuanzong, following his advice, did so. In or around 713, he submitted a petition to the chancellor Yao Chong, pointing out the importance of a clean and fair civil service system, and Yao was impressed.

Zhang became known for his talent in understanding people&#x27;s talents. At that time, Emperor Xuanzong had him and his colleague Zhao Dongxi () decide the postings for the people selected for official service by the ministry of civil service affairs, and he and Zhao were considered fair and capable in finding the right posts for people. In 722, he became &quot;Sixun Yuanwailang&quot; (), a low level official at the ministry of civil service affairs. At that time, Zhang Yue was a chancellor as &quot;Zhongshu Ling&quot; (中書令, the head of the legislative bureau), and he considered Zhang Jiuling, as they had the same family name, like a brother, often stating, &quot;He will surely be the most distinguished poet.&quot; Zhang Jiuling was also happy that Zhang Shuo appreciated his talent, and therefore became a follower of Zhang Yue&#x27;s. In 723, he was made a &quot;Zhongshu Sheren&quot; (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau, serving under Zhang Yue.

In 725, at Zhang Yue&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong offered sacrifice to heaven and earth at Mount Tai. After the ceremony, many of the officials that Zhang Shuo favored were to be promoted to high positions. Zhang Yue had Zhang Jiuling draft the edict for the promotions. Knowing that such promotions would draw resentment from others, Zhang Jiuling tried to dissuade Zhang Yue, but Zhang Yue insisted, causing much resentment against Zhang Shuo. In particular, Zhang Jiuling warned Zhang Yue about the minister Yuwen Rong, whom Zhang Shuo did not respect but whom Emperor Xuanzong favored for his talent in gathering money for the imperial treasury. Zhang Yue did not believe Yuwen Rong could do him harm, but in 726 found himself removed after accusations by Yuwen. In the aftermath, Zhang Jiuling was made the deputy minister of worship (太常少卿, &quot;Taichang Shaoqing&quot;) -- an honored post without much actual authority—and soon was made the prefect of Ji Prefecture (冀州, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei). Zhang, because his mother was then old and at home in Shao Prefecture, requested to be posted to a prefecture south of the Yangtze River, so that he could better communicate with her. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict praising him for his filial piety, and made him the commandant at Hong Prefecture (洪州, roughly modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). Zhang was later made the commandant at Gui Prefecture (桂州, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi) and the examiner of Lingnan Circuit. Emperor Xuanzong further made his brothers Zhang Jiuzhang () and Zhang Jiugao () prefects in the region as well, so that the brothers could all visit their mother on holidays.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yue was no longer chancellor, but was still the head of the imperial institute Jixian Institute (). He often recommended Zhang Jiuling for his talent. After Zhang Yue died near the new year 731, Emperor Xuanzong remembered Zhang Yue&#x27;s recommendations and recalled Zhang Jiuling to serve as &quot;Mishu Shaojian&quot; (), the deputy head of the Palace Library, as well as a scholar at Jixian Institute, acting as its head. At that time, it happened that an edict needed to be issued to the vassal kingdom Balhae, but no one could write one well. Emperor Xuanzong had Zhang draft one, and it was written quickly. Soon thereafter, Zhang was made the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, &quot;Gongbu Shilang&quot;) but was put in charge of drafting edicts. He was then made &quot;Zhongshu Shilang&quot; (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. In 732, his mother died, and he returned to Shao Prefecture to observe a period of mourning for her.

Around the new year 733, Emperor Xuanzong removed then-chancellors Xiao Song and Han Xiu from their chancellor positions, and named Pei Yaoqing and Zhang to replace them—ordering Zhang to end his period of mourning, which was to last for three years, early, making him &quot;Zhongshu Shilang&quot; but with the chancellor &quot;de facto&quot; designation of &quot;Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhanshi&quot; (). After Zhang subsequently arrived at the eastern capital Luoyang, where Emperor Xuanzong was at the time, he requested that he be allowed to return to mourning. Emperor Xuanzong rejected the request.

Later in 733, Zhang proposed that private citizens be allowed to mint money. With opposition from Pei and Liu Zhi, however, Emperor Xuanzong rejected the proposal. Later that year, Zhang was made &quot;Zhongshu Ling&quot; and continued to serve as chancellor. Other projects that Zhang proposed included reestablishing the offices of examiners of the 10 circuits and also rice farming in the prefectures just south of the Yellow River, which ended in failure. Zhang was further said to be impatient and easily angered, damaging his reputation. However, Zhang was also said to be honest and always seeking to correct the emperor&#x27;s behavior, even if it offended the emperor. For example, in 735, after the general Zhang Shougui () scored a major victory over the Khitan, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to reward Zhang Shougui by making him a chancellor, but Zhang Jiuling pointed out that it was inappropriate to use the chancellorship as a reward, even with just the honorable title and no actual authority (as Emperor Xuanzong considered as well) and that giving Zhang Shougui the chancellorship for defeating the Khitan meant that there would be no other available awards if he were to defeat the Xi and the Eastern Tujue as well. Emperor Xuanzong agreed and did not give Zhang Shougui the chancellorship. Also in 735, Zhang Jiuling was given the honorific title &quot;Jinzi Guanglu Daifu&quot; () and created the Count of Shixing. Zhang was also known for his firm friendships with the officials Yan Tingzhi (), Yuan Renjing (), Liang Shengqing () and Lu Yi (), despite his later taking higher positions than they did, drawing much praise for his commitment to friends.

In 736, after Zhang Shougui suffered a loss because his subordinate An Lushan failed to follow orders, Zhang Shougui, not wanting to kill An but not wanting to release him for fear of losing authority, sent An to Chang&#x27;an, asking the emperor to decide the punishment. Zhang Jiuling submitted the suggestion to have An executed, stating:

He also argued that he believed that An had the temperament to commit treason and would surely do so in the future, but Emperor Xuanzong did not agree. Emperor Xuanzong was impressed by An&#x27;s military talent and ordered that he be reduced to commoner rank and be allowed to stay in the army.

September 14, 736, was Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s birthday, and the princes and the dukes all offered jeweled mirrors as gifts. Zhang Jiuling, believing that the best way to reflect on oneself was to look at others, wrote a five-volume work, calling it the &quot;Golden Mirror Records for a Thousand Years&quot; (千秋金鑑錄 -- &quot;a thousand years&quot; being an oblique reference to wishing the Emperor a long life, on his birthday), discussing historical examples of rulership, and offered it to Emperor Xuanzong as his gift. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict thanking and praising him.

By 736, however, fellow chancellor Li Linfu was beginning to gain favor at the expense of Pei and Zhang, who were friendly with each other. At that time, there were several incidents for which the blunt Zhang had offended either Emperor Xuanzong—who was described to have begun to tire of governance and started seeking luxuries in earnest—or Li Linfu, who was described to be ingratiating the emperor:

* In fall 736, when Emperor Xuanzong was at Luoyang, he had set to return to Chang&#x27;an on March 7, 737. However, at that time, an incident occurred where there were strange apparitions appearing in the Luoyang Palace, and Emperor Xuanzong did not want to stay at Luoyang. On or right before November 9, 736, he summoned the chancellors to ask them whether he could depart for Chang&#x27;an immediately. Pei and Zhang, pointing out the fact that it was harvest season and that the imperial train would interfere with harvest, requested a one-month delay. After Pei and Zhang exited, however, Li Linfu remained personally and stated his agreement with the departure, arguing that the farmers could be compensated by relieving their taxes. Emperor Xuanzong was pleased and immediately departed for Chang&#x27;an.
* Emperor Xuanzong was, then, impressed with Niu Xianke, the military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;) of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), wanted to make him the minister of defense. Zhang, who pointed out that Niu was not well-learned and had started from the ranks of low-level administrators—contrary to the Tang tradition of going through the imperial examinations—opposed, and then further opposed the creation of a title. Eventually, despite Zhang&#x27;s opposition, Emperor Xuanzong, with concurrence from Li LInfu, created Niu the Duke of Longxi.
* Li Linfu was associating with Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s favorite concubine Consort Wu and trying to have Emperor Xuanzong make her son Li Mao () the Prince of Shou crown prince to replace Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s then-crown prince Li Ying, who had long lost Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s favor. With Zhang strenuously opposing such a move, Li Ying remained in his position.
* The deputy minister Xiao Jiong (), whom Li Linfu recommended, was demoted on the suggestion of Zhang and Zhang&#x27;s friend Yan Tingzhi, who further offended Li Linfu by refusing to meet with him. Soon thereafter, there was an incident where Wang Yunyan (), the husband of Yan&#x27;s ex-wife, was accused of corruption. Yan tried to intercede on Wang&#x27;s behalf, and this was discovered.

Li Linfu thus made accusations to Emperor Xuanzong that Zhang and Pei were engaging in factionalism. Around the new year 737, Emperor Xuanzong removed Pei and Zhang from their chancellor posts, making them &quot;Chengxiang&quot; () -- the heads of the executive bureau (尚書省, &quot;Shangshu Sheng&quot;) instead. Niu was made chancellor to replace them, serving with Li Linfu. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, for example, commented:

In 737, the imperial censor Zhou Ziliang () submitted an indictment against Niu, arguing that Niu should not be chancellor because he lacked talent to be chancellor, and further citing prophecies that appeared to indicate that someone named Niu would usurp the throne. Emperor Xuanzong was incensed, and had Zhou caned and exiled—and Zhou died shortly after departing Chang&#x27;an. Li Linfu then submitted an accusation against Zhang, pointing out that Zhang had recommended Zhou. Zhang was therefore demoted to be the secretary general at Jing Prefecture (荊州, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). However, even after Zhang&#x27;s demotion, Emperor Xuanzong still remembered his honesty, and when officials were recommended, he would often make the inquiry, &quot;How does their honesty compare to Zhang Jiuling?&quot; Zhang died in 740, while on a vacation in Shao Prefecture to visit his parents&#x27; tomb, and was given posthumous honors.

After An, then a powerful military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;), rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s rule in 755, Emperor Xuanzong was, in 756, forced to flee to Jiannan Circuit (劍南道, roughly modern Sichuan and Chongqing) and pass the throne to his son Emperor Suzong. Remembering Zhang&#x27;s warnings about An, issued an edict further posthumously honoring Zhang and sent messengers to Shao Prefecture to offer sacrifices to Zhang.

<text>Part XVIII of the Constitution of India allows for a constitutional setup that can be proclaimed by the president of India as a state of emergency, when the consultant group perceives and warns against grave threats to the nation from internal and external sources or from financial situations of crisis. Under Article 352 of the Indian constitution, upon the advice of the cabinet of ministers, the President can overrule many provisions of the constitution, which can suspend fundamental rights to the citizens of India and acts governing devolution of powers to the states which form the federation. In the history of independent India, such a state of emergency has been declared thrice. 

# The first instance was between 26 October 1962 to 21 November 1962 during the [[Sino-Indian War|India-China]] war, when &quot;the security of India&quot; was declared as being &quot;threatened by external aggression&quot;.
# The second instance was between 3 and 17 December 1971, which was originally proclaimed during the Indo-Pakistan war.
# The third proclamation [[The Emergency (India)|between 25 June 1975 to January 1977]] was under controversial circumstances of political instability under Indira Gandhi&#x27;s premiership, when emergency was declared on the basis of &quot;internal disturbances&quot;. The proclamation immediately followed a ruling in the Allahabad High Court, that voided the Prime Minister&#x27;s election from Rae Bareli in the 1971 Indian general election. She was also prohibited from contesting election for next 6 years, challenging her legitimacy to continue in her post. Indira Gandhi, instead recommended to the then president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to proclaim a state of emergency to strengthen her hand. 

The phrase &quot;Emergency period&quot; used loosely, when referring to the political history of India, often refers to this third and the most controversial of the three occasions.

In 1978, the Forty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India, substituted the words &quot;armed rebellion&quot; for &quot;internal disturbance&quot; in Article 352, making the term more specific and less subject to interpretations. The amendment also protected Articles 20 and 21 from being suspended during an emergency.

The President can declare three types of emergencies — national, state and financial emergency in a state.

==National emergency under Article 352==
Originally at the beginning, a National emergency could be declared on the basis of &quot;external aggression or war&quot; and &quot;internal disturbance&quot; in the whole of India or a part of its territory under Article 352. Such an emergency was declared in India in the 1962 Sino- Indian War, 1971 Indo- Pakistani War, and 1975 internal disturbance (declared by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed ). But after the 44th amendment act 1978, National Emergency can only be declared on grounds of &quot;External aggression or war&quot;, also called as External Emergency &amp; on the ground of &quot;armed rebellion&quot;, also called as Internal Emergency. The President can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. Such a proclamation must be laid before both houses of Parliament and the state of emergency expires after one month unless approved within that time by both houses sitting and voting separately. However, if the Lok Sabha (the lower house) has been dissolved or dissolution takes place in the state of emergency, and the Rajya Sabha approves of the state of emergency, the deadline for the Lok Sabha is extended until thirty days after that house reconstituted. According to Article 352(6), approval by either house requires a special majority: those in favour of the motion must be two-thirds of those present and voting, and amount to a majority of the entire membership of that house. A Parliamentary resolution extends the state of emergency for up to six months, and it can be extended indefinitely by further resolutions in six-monthly increments.

During a national emergency, many Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended. The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. By contrast, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended according to the original Constitution. In January 1977, during the emergency declared controversially by Indira Gandhi, the government decided to suspend even the Right to Life and Personal Liberty by dispensing with Habeas corpus. Justice Hans Raj Khanna defended the Right to Life and asked: &quot;Life is also mentioned in Article 21 and would Government argument extend to it also?&quot;. The Attorney General observed: &quot;Even if life was taken away illegally, courts are helpless&quot;.

A national emergency modifies the quasi-federal system of government to a unitary one by granting Parliament the power to make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws). Also, all state money bills are referred to the Parliament for its approval.

During an emergency, the term of the Lok Sabha can be successively extended by intervals of up to one year, but not beyond six months after the state of emergency has been revoked.

== President Rule, under Article 356 ==

It had been declared for the first time in the State of Punjab in 1951. A state of emergency can be declared in any state of India under article 356 on the recommendation of the governor of the state. Every state in India has been under a state of emergency at some point of time or the other. The state of emergency is commonly known as &#x27;President&#x27;s Rule&#x27; and is usually not referred to as &#x27;State Emergency&#x27; for a number of reasons.

If the President is satisfied, based on the report of the Governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the Constitution, the governor may declare an emergency in the state. Such an emergency must be approved by the Parliament within a period of two months.

It is imposed for an initial period of six months and can last for a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. The 42nd amendment act of 1976 extended the initial time duration of President Rule from 6 months to 1 year. Subsequently, 44th CAA 1978 restored the 1-year period back to 6 months. Originally, the maximum period of operation of President Rule was 3 years. This 3-year period was divided into 1 year of ordinary period and 2 years of extra ordinary period for which certain conditions were to be fulfilled. However, now unless revoked, its life can be extended by six months each time, but in no case beyond three years. If the emergency has to be extended for more than three years, it can only be done by a Constitution of India constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.

During such emergency, the President can take over the entire work of the executive, and the Governor administers the state in the name of the President. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The Parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list. All money bills have to be referred to the Parliament for approval. In this occasion ministers of state legislature do not perform actions in state.

<doc id="1137949" wikidata="Q2859660" url="?curid=1137949" title="Statistical arbitrage">
<text>In finance, statistical arbitrage (often abbreviated as Stat Arb or StatArb) is a class of short-term financial trading strategies that employ mean reversion models involving broadly diversified portfolios of securities (hundreds to thousands) held for short periods of time (generally seconds to days). These strategies are supported by substantial mathematical, computational, and trading platforms.

==Trading strategy==

Broadly speaking, StatArb is actually any strategy that is bottom-up, beta-neutral in approach and uses statistical/econometric techniques in order to provide signals for execution. Signals are often generated through a contrarian mean reversion principle but can also be designed using such factors as lead/lag effects, corporate activity, short-term momentum, etc. This is usually referred to as a multi-factor approach to StatArb.

Because of the large number of stocks involved, the high portfolio turnover and the fairly small size of the effects one is trying to capture, the strategy is often implemented in an automated fashion and great attention is placed on reducing trading costs. 

Statistical arbitrage has become a major force at both hedge funds and investment banks. Many bank proprietary operations now center to varying degrees around statistical arbitrage trading.

As a trading strategy, statistical arbitrage is a heavily quantitative and computational approach to securities trading. It involves data mining and statistical methods, as well as the use of automated trading systems.

Historically, StatArb evolved out of the simpler pairs trade strategy, in which stocks are put into pairs by fundamental or market-based similarities. When one stock in a pair outperforms the other, the under performing stock is bought long and the outperforming stock is sold short with the expectation that under performing stock will climb towards its outperforming partner. 

Mathematically speaking, the strategy is to find a pair of stocks with high correlation, cointegration, or other common factor characteristics. Various statistical tools have been used in the context of pairs trading ranging from simple distance-based approaches to more complex tools such as cointegration and copula concepts.

StatArb considers not pairs of stocks but a portfolio of a hundred or more stocks—some long, some short—that are carefully matched by sector and region to eliminate exposure to beta and other risk factors. Portfolio construction is automated and consists of two phases. In the first or &quot;scoring&quot; phase, each stock in the market is assigned a numeric score or rank that reflects its desirability; high scores indicate stocks that should be held long and low scores indicate stocks that are candidates for shorting. The details of the scoring formula vary and are highly proprietary, but, generally (as in pairs trading), they involve a short term mean reversion principle so that, e.g., stocks that have done unusually well in the past week receive low scores and stocks that have underperformed receive high scores. In the second or &quot;risk reduction&quot; phase, the stocks are combined into a portfolio in carefully matched proportions so as to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, market and factor risk. This phase often uses commercially available risk models like MSCI/Barra, APT, Northfield, Risk Infotech, and Axioma to constrain or eliminate various risk factors.

==Risks==
Over a finite period of time, a low probability market movement may impose heavy short-term losses. If such short-term losses are greater than the investor&#x27;s funding to meet interim margin calls, its positions may need to be liquidated at a loss even when its strategy&#x27;s modeled forecasts ultimately turn out to be correct. The 1998 default of Long-Term Capital Management was a widely publicized example of a fund that failed due to its inability to post collateral to cover adverse market fluctuations.

Statistical arbitrage is also subject to model weakness as well as stock- or security-specific risk. The statistical relationship on which the model is based may be spurious, or may break down due to changes in the distribution of returns on the underlying assets. Factors, which the model may not be aware of having exposure to, could become the significant drivers of price action in the markets, and the inverse applies also. The existence of the investment based upon model itself may change the underlying relationship, particularly if enough entrants invest with similar principles. The exploitation of arbitrage opportunities themselves increases the efficiency of the market, thereby reducing the scope for arbitrage, so continual updating of models is necessary.

On a stock-specific level, there is risk of M&amp;A activity or even default for an individual name. Such an event would immediately invalidate the significance of any historical relationship assumed from empirical statistical analysis of the past data.

=== 2007-2008 financial crisis ===
During July and August 2007, a number of StatArb (and other Quant type) hedge funds experienced significant losses at the same time, which is difficult to explain unless there was a common risk factor. While the reasons are not yet fully understood, several published accounts blame the emergency liquidation of a fund that experienced capital withdrawals or margin calls. By closing out its positions quickly, the fund put pressure on the prices of the stocks it was long and short. Because other StatArb funds had similar positions, due to the similarity of their alpha models and risk-reduction models, the other funds experienced adverse returns. One of the versions of the events describes how Morgan Stanley&#x27;s highly successful StatArb fund, PDT, decided to reduce its positions in response to stresses in other parts of the firm, and how this contributed to several days of hectic trading.

In a sense, the fact of a stock being heavily involved in StatArb is itself a risk factor, one that is relatively new and thus was not taken into account by the StatArb models. These events showed that StatArb has developed to a point where it is a significant factor in the marketplace, that existing funds have similar positions and are in effect competing for the same returns. Simulations of simple StatArb strategies by Khandani and Lo show that the returns to such strategies have been reduced considerably from 1998 to 2007, presumably because of competition.

It has also been argued that the events during August 2007 were linked to reduction of liquidity, possibly due to risk reduction by high-frequency market makers during that time.

It is a noteworthy point of contention, that the common reduction in portfolio value could also be attributed to a causal mechanism. The 2007-2008 financial crisis also occurred at this time. Many, if not the vast majority, of investors of any form, booked losses during this one year time frame. The association of observed losses at hedge funds using statistical arbitrage is not necessarily indicative of dependence. As more competitors enter the market, and funds diversify their trades across more platforms than StatArb, a point can be made that there should be no reason to expect the platform models to behave anything like each other. Their statistical models could be entirely independent.

==Worldwide practice==
Statistical arbitrage faces different regulatory situations in different countries or markets. In many countries where the trading security or derivatives are not fully developed, investors find it infeasible or unprofitable to implement statistical arbitrage in local markets.

===China===
In China, quantitative investment including statistical arbitrage is not the mainstream approach to investment. A set of market conditions restricts the trading behavior of funds and other financial institutions. The restriction on short selling as well as the market stabilization mechanisms (e.g. daily limit) set heavy obstacles when either individual investors or institutional investors try to implement the trading strategy implied by statistical arbitrage theory.

<text>Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined medieval castle on the western side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the original moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the late 12th or early 13th century and the castle played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison. The surviving rectangular St George&#x27;s Tower is now believed to pre-date the remainder of the castle and be a watch tower associated with the original Saxon west gate of the city.

Most of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford&#x27;s local prison. A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876; this became HM Prison Oxford.

The prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel and visitor attraction. The medieval remains of the castle including the motte, St George&#x27;s Tower and crypt, are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument.

==History==
===Construction===

According to the &quot;Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis&quot; (Abingdon Chronicle), Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D&#x27;Oyly the elder from 1071 to 1073. D&#x27;Oyly had arrived in England with William I the Conqueror in the Norman Conquest of England and William granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D&#x27;Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D&#x27;Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey. D&#x27;Oyly (d&#x27;Oilly)&#x27;s Oxford holdings are, however, mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Meadow 30 acres. 1 mill, value 0.5 [pounds].&quot;; the mill mentioned is presumably the Castle Mill, formerly adjacent to the still surviving St. George&#x27;s Tower, rebuilt in 1781 before eventually being demolished in 1930.

D&#x27;Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town, using the natural protection of a stream off the River Thames on the far side of the castle, now called Castle Mill Stream, and diverting the stream to produce a moat. There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site, but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo-Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification. Oxford Castle was an &quot;urban castle&quot;, overlying a portion of the Saxon town wall, but it remains uncertain whether local buildings were demolished to make room for it. Poore &quot;et al&quot;. (2009) give a suggested street plan of the town in late Saxon times (their figure 4) showing the then town wall with its north, west, south and east gates; at the north gate is the Saxon tower now associated with the church of St Michael at the North Gate, while the west gate is occupied by the apparently Saxon tower of St. George&#x27;s, which is now believed to have subsequently been incorporated into the fabric of the later Norman castle.
The initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey, copying the plan of the castle that D&#x27;Oyly had already built away at Wallingford. The motte was originally about high and wide, constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing. There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey: it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first (thus utilising the pre-existing St. George&#x27;s Tower as the first keep) which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey.

By the late 12th to early 13th century, the original palisade walls and wooden keep had been replaced in stone. The new curtain wall incorporated St George&#x27;s Tower, which is built of coral rag stone, at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability. This was the tallest of the castle&#x27;s towers, and is now believed to be a survival from late Saxon times (c. 1020) as a watch tower associated with the west gate of the Saxon city. Evidence that this tower is Saxon in origin and thus pre-dates the castle itself is presented in Poore &quot;et al&quot;. (2009), who comment that &quot;a single, massive stone tower does not seem to belong within the outer defences of an earth-and-timber castle&quot;, and other sources have concurred on architectural grounds, also noting that its orientation does not match that of the remainder of the castle, and that its height would have originally afforded an extensive view over the city, but which would have been superseded (and in fact, blocked) with the construction of the castle motte. The date of the remaining towers is uncertain although the southernmost, round tower, of which the base still remains, is dated to 1235 in various documentary sources, including Woolnoth&#x27;s &quot;The Ancient Castles of England and Wales&quot; of 1825; in at least one source, it is referred to as &quot;Henry III&#x27;s Tower&quot;.

Inside the walls the buildings included a chapel with a crypt attached to St. Georges Tower, which may be on the site of a previous church. The chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It was a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D&#x27;Oyly and his close friend, Roger d&#x27;Ivry had endowed a chapel with a college of priests, which is presumed to be the structure in question; at an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George. As detailed below, the crypt of this chapel still survives, albeit in a new location within the castle, having been moved and reconstructed from its original materials in 1794.

The ten-sided stone shell keep, , constructed in the 13th century to replace an earlier wooden structure, closely resembled those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles. The keep enclosed a number of buildings, leaving an inner courtyard only across. Within the keep, stairs led down to an underground wide stone chamber, with an Early English hexagonal vault and a deep well providing water in the event of siege.

===Role in the Anarchy and Barons War===
Robert D&#x27;Oyly the younger, Robert D&#x27;Oyly the elder&#x27;s nephew, had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen&#x27;s cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew&#x27;s Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda&#x27;s supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.

Finally in December, Matilda responded by escaping from the castle; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls with three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen&#x27;s lines in the night as the king&#x27;s sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D&#x27;Oyly, Robert D&#x27;Oyly the younger&#x27;s son, in 1154.

In the Barons&#x27; War of 1215–17 the castle was attacked again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breauté, who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.

===14th–17th centuries===


By 1327 the fortification, particularly the castle gates and the barbican, was in poor condition and £800 was estimated to be required for repairs. From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair. 

On 13 January, 1400, Henry IV sat in judgment at Oxford Castle over rebels from Cirencester and other places, who had participated in the Epiphany Rising, or the Revolt of the Earls, men who supported Richard II, Henry’s cousin he murdered by starvation. The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford, a jail, and a criminal court. Assizes were held there until 1577, when plague broke out in what became known as the &quot;Black Assize&quot;: the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, two knights, eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died, including Sir Robert D&#x27;Oyley, a relative of the founder of the castle. Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle.

Ralph Agas&#x27;s map of Oxford in 1578 shows that by then, while the curtain wall, keep and towers remained, the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses. Hassall, 1976, states that by 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall, although this is contradicted by the castle&#x27;s appearance in John Speed&#x27;s map of Oxford, 1605. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church (a college of the university) in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time, Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep. A map of the castle prepared for Christ Church in 1615 shows the keep on its mound, St George&#x27;s Tower with associated buildings and sections of the curtain wall remaining to the north and south, and the next tower to the south, plus a single remaining tower to the north-east, as well as the Castle Mill and a southern entrance to the castle complex; this map indicates that by 1615 houses and gardens had been laid out over more than half of the Castle Ditch or moat, which appears to still contain water. 

In 1642, the First English Civil War broke out, and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646, and the city was occupied by Colonel Richard Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II&#x27;s forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped into its current form.

===Role as prison===

After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. A view of the castle published in 1769 in the work &quot;England Displayed&quot; by P. Russell and Owen Price is of interest in that it shows the appearance of the chapel attached to St George&#x27;s tower prior to its demolition in 1794, as well as the motte and some then-surviving portions of the curtain wall including an arch or gateway in the wall immediately to the north of the tower. The chapel and/or associated buildings are also shown, from a range of angles, in views by other artists including Samuel and Nathaniel Buck&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities&quot; (drawing dated 1729), a 1773 engraving included in Francis Grose&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of England and Wales&quot;, 1786, a painting by Michael Angelo Rooker dating from 1779, and a view by the artist John Baptist Malchair dating from 1784. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including the extent to which vermin infested the prison. Partly as a result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.

In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old chapel attached to St George&#x27;s tower and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King.

In the 19th century the site continued to be developed, with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840–41 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854. The prison itself was extended in 1876, growing to occupy most of the remaining space. The inmates included children, the youngest being a seven-year-old girl sentenced to seven days hard labour in 1870 for stealing a pram. In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford.

===Today===

Today, the remains of the Saxon St.George&#x27;s Tower, Motte-and-Bailey Mound, the Prison D-Wing and Debtor&#x27;s Tower make up the &quot;Oxford Castle &amp; Prison&quot; tourist attraction. 

The prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying a large part of the former prison blocks, with cells converted as guest rooms. However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests. The mixed-use heritage project, officially opened on 5 May 2006, won the RICS Project of the Year Award 2007.

The full extent of the original castle is somewhat obliterated today, especially with the intrusion of the newer County Hall into the eastern side, while New Road runs over the location of north-east portion of the curtain wall with its two square towers; nevertheless the position of its outer perimeter moat is approximated by portions of New Road, Castle Street and Paradise Street (refer map at right), while the remains of the original Barbican lie underneath the modern Westgate shopping centre. Since 1954 the two oldest parts of the castle have been Grade I listed buildings: the 11th-century motte with its 13th-century well-chamber, the circa 11th-century St George&#x27;s tower (listed as Norman, but now generally believed to be Saxon), the relocated crypt chapel, and the 18th-century D-wing and Debtors&#x27; Tower. The site is protected as a Scheduled Monument. As at 2018, guided tours of the surviving medieval and 18th-century portions are available to visitors via a commercial operator, Heritage Projects (Oxford Castle) Ltd, with opening hours and pricing available via their website.

<text>In the relational data model a superkey is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies each tuple of a relation. Because superkey values are unique, tuples with the same superkey value must also have the same non-key attribute values. That is, non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the superkey.

The set of all attributes is always a superkey (the trivial superkey). Tuples in a relation are by definition unique, with duplicates removed after each operation, so the set of all attributes is always uniquely valued for every tuple. A candidate key (or minimal superkey) is a superkey that can&#x27;t be reduced to a simpler superkey by removing an attribute.

For example, in an employee schema with attributes codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4, if codice_1 values are unique then codice_1 combined with any or all of the other attributes can uniquely identify tuples in the table. Each combination, {codice_1}, {codice_1, codice_2}, {codice_1, codice_2, codice_3}, and so on is a superkey. {codice_1} is a candidate key, since no subset of its attributes is also a superkey. {codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4} is the trivial superkey.

If attribute set &quot;K&quot; is a superkey of relation &quot;R&quot;, then at all times it is the case that the projection of &quot;R&quot; over &quot;K&quot; has the same cardinality as &quot;R&quot; itself.

==Example==
First, list out all the sets of attributes:
:• {Monarch Name}  
:• {Monarch Number}  
:• {Royal House}
:• {Monarch Name, Monarch Number}
:• {Monarch Name, Royal House}
:• {Monarch Number, Royal House}
:• {Monarch Name, Monarch Number, Royal House}

Second, eliminate all the sets which do not meet superkey&#x27;s requirement. For example, {Monarch Name, Royal House} cannot be a superkey because for the same attribute values (Edward, Plantagenet), there are two distinct tuples:
* (Edward, II, Plantagenet)
* (Edward, III, Plantagenet)

Finally, after elimination, the remaining sets of attributes are the only possible superkeys in this example:
* {Monarch Name, Monarch Number} — this is also the candidate key
* {Monarch Name, Monarch Number, Royal House}

In reality, superkeys cannot be determined simply by examining one set of tuples in a relation. A superkey defines a functional dependency constraint of a relation schema which must hold for all possible instance relations of that relation schema.

<doc id="1137954" wikidata="Q1139357" url="?curid=1137954" title="Sun Salutation">
<text>Sun Salutation, also called Surya Namaskar or Salute to the Sun (, ), is a practice in yoga as exercise incorporating a flow sequence of some twelve linked asanas. The asana sequence was first recorded as yoga in the early 20th century, though similar exercises were in use in India before that, for example among wrestlers. The basic sequence involves moving from a standing position into Downward and Upward Dog poses and then back to the standing position, but many variations are possible. The set of 12 asanas is dedicated to the Hindu solar deity, Surya. In some Indian traditions, the positions are each associated with a different mantra.

The precise origins of the Sun Salutation are uncertain, but the sequence was made popular in the early 20th century by Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the Rajah of Aundh, and adopted into yoga by Krishnamacharya in the Mysore Palace, where the Sun Salutation classes, not then considered to be yoga, were held next door to his yogasala. Pioneering yoga teachers taught by Krishnamacharya, including Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar, taught transitions between asanas derived from the Sun Salutation to their pupils worldwide.

==Etymology and origins==
The name Surya Namaskar is from the Sanskrit सूर्य &quot;Sūrya&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot; and नमस्कार &quot;Namaskāra&quot;, &quot;Greeting&quot; or &quot;Salute&quot;. Surya is the Hindu god of the sun. This identifies the Sun as the soul and source of all life. Chandra Namaskara is similarly from Sanskrit चन्द्र &quot;Chandra&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;.

The origins of the Sun Salutation are vague; Indian tradition connects the 17th century saint Samarth Ramdas with Surya Namaskara exercises, without defining what movements were involved. In the 1920s, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the Rajah of Aundh, popularized and named the practice, describing it in his 1928 book &quot;The Ten-Point Way to Health: Surya Namaskars&quot;. It has been asserted that Pant Pratinidhi invented it, but Pant stated that it was already a commonplace Marathi tradition.

Ancient but simpler Sun salutations such as Aditya Hridayam, described in the &quot;Yuddha Kaanda&quot; Canto 107 of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, are not related to the modern sequence. The anthropologist Joseph Alter states that the Sun Salutation was not recorded in any Haṭha yoga text before the 19th century. At that time, the Sun Salutation was not considered to be yoga, and its postures were not considered asanas; the pioneer of yoga as exercise, Yogendra, wrote criticising the &quot;indiscriminate&quot; mixing of sun salutation with yoga as the &quot;ill-informed&quot; were doing.

The yoga scholar-practitioner Norman Sjoman suggested that Krishnamacharya, &quot;the father of modern yoga&quot;, used the traditional and &quot;very old&quot; Indian wrestlers&#x27; exercises called &quot;dandas&quot; (Sanskrit: दण्ड &quot;daṇḍa&quot;, a staff), described in the 1896 &quot;Vyayama Dipika&quot;, as the basis for the sequence and for his transitioning vinyasas. Different &quot;dandas&quot; closely resemble the Sun Salutation asanas Tadasana, Padahastasana, Caturanga Dandasana, and Bhujangasana. Krishnamacharya was aware of the Sun Salutation, since regular classes were held in the hall adjacent to his Yogasala in the Rajah of Mysore&#x27;s palace. The yoga scholar Mark Singleton states that &quot;Krishnamacharya was to make the flowing movements of &quot;sūryanamaskār&quot; the basis of his Mysore yoga style&quot;. His students, K. Pattabhi Jois, who created Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga, and B. K. S. Iyengar, who created Iyengar Yoga, both learned Sun Salutation and flowing vinyasa movements between asanas from Krishnamacharya and used them in their styles of yoga.

The historian of modern yoga Elliott Goldberg writes that Vishnudevananda&#x27;s 1960 book &quot;The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga&quot; &quot;proclaimed in print&quot; a &quot;new utilitarian conception of Surya Namaskara&quot; which his guru Sivananda had originally promoted as a health cure through sunlight. Goldberg notes that Vishnudevananda modelled the positions of the Sun Salutation for photographs in the book, and that he recognised the sequence &quot;for what it mainly is: not treatment for a host of diseases but fitness exercise.&quot;

== Description ==

The Sun Salutation is a sequence of around twelve yoga asanas connected by jumping or stretching movements, varying somewhat between schools. In Iyengar Yoga, the basic sequence is Tadasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Uttanasana, Uttanasana with head up, Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Dog), Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward Dog), Chaturanga Dandasana, and then reversing the sequence to return to Tadasana; other poses can be inserted into the sequence.

In Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga, there are two Sun Salutation sequences, types A and B. The type A sequence of asanas is Pranamasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Uttanasana, Phalakasana (high plank), Chaturanga Dandasana, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, Adho Mukha Svanasana, Uttanasana and back to Pranamasana. The type B sequence of asanas (differences marked in italics) is Pranamasana, &quot;Utkatasana&quot;, Uttanasana, &quot;Ardha Uttanasana&quot;, Phalakasana, Chaturanga Dandasana, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, Adho Mukha Svanasana, &quot;Virabhadrasana I&quot;, repeat from Phalakasana onwards with Virabhadrasana I on the other side, then repeat Phalakasana through to Adho Mukha Svanasana (a third time), Ardha Uttanasana, Uttanasana, Utkatasana, and back to Pranamasana.

A typical Sun Salutation cycle is:

== Mantras ==

In some yoga traditions, each step of the sequence is associated with a mantra. In traditions including Sivananda Yoga, the steps are linked with twelve names of the deity Surya, the Sun:

Indian tradition associates the steps with Bījā (&quot;seed&quot; sound) mantras and with five chakras (focal points of the subtle body).

==Variations==

===Inserting other asanas===

Many variations are possible. For example, in Iyengar Yoga the sequence may intentionally be varied to run Tadasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Uttanasana, Adho Mukha Svanasana, Lolasana, Janusirsasana (one side, then the other), and reversing the sequence from Adho Mukha Svanasana to return to Tadasana. Other asanas that may be inserted into the sequence include Navasana (or Ardha Navasana), Paschimottanasana and its variations, and Marichyasana I.

===Chandra Namaskara===

Variant sequences named Chandra Namaskar, the Moon Salutation, are sometimes practised; these were created late in the 20th century. One such sequence consists of the asanas Tadasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Anjaneyasana (sometimes called Half Moon Pose), a kneeling lunge, Adho Mukha Svanasana, Bitilasana, Balasana, kneeling with thighs, body, and arms pointing straight up, Balasana with elbows on ground, hands together in Anjali Mudra behind the head, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, Adho Mukha Svanasana, Uttanasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Pranamasana, and Tadasana. Other Moon Salutations with different asanas have been published.

== As exercise ==

The energy cost of exercise is measured in units of metabolic equivalent of task (MET). Less than 3 METs counts as light exercise; 3 to 6 METs is moderate; 6 or over is vigorous. American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines count periods of at least 10 minutes of moderate MET level activity towards their recommended daily amounts of exercise. For healthy adults aged 18 to 65, the guidelines recommend moderate exercise for 30 minutes five days a week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 20 minutes three days a week.

The Sun Salutation&#x27;s energy cost ranges widely according to how energetically it is practised, from a light 2.9 to a vigorous 7.4 METs. The higher end of the range requires transition jumps between the poses. Practitioners accustomed to Sun Salutation can find performing the sequence an &quot;exhilarating process&quot;.

== Muscle usage ==

A 2014 study indicated that the muscle groups activated by specific asanas varied with the skill of the practitioners, from beginner to instructor. The eleven asanas in the Sun Salutation sequences A and B of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga were performed by beginners, advanced practitioners and instructors. The activation of 14 groups of muscles was measured with electrode on the skin over the muscles. Among the findings, beginners used pectoral muscles more than instructors, whereas instructors used deltoid muscles more than other practitioners, as well as the vastus medialis (which stabilises the knee). The yoga instructor Grace Bullock writes that such patterns of activation suggest that asana practice increases awareness of the body and the patterns in which muscles are engaged, making exercise more beneficial and safer.

==In culture==

The founder of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, K. Pattabhi Jois, stated that &quot;There is no Ashtanga yoga without Surya Namaskara, which is the ultimate salutation to the Sun god.&quot;

<text>Suttungr , or Saturn XXIII, is a natural satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 12. It was named for Suttungr in Norse mythology, a Jötunn or giant who once owned the mead of poetry.

Suttungr is about 7 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,667 Mm in 1029.703 days. It may have formed from debris knocked off Phoebe. The Suttung orbit is retrograde, at an inclination of 174° to the ecliptic (151° to Saturn&#x27;s equator) and with an eccentricity of 0.131. Its rotation period is hours, and like Albiorix its light curve exhibits two minima at certain angles, and three minima at others. Having a similar gray color and orbit as Thrymr, the two moons may be members of the same dynamical family.

Its name was announced in its oblique form Suttung in IAU Circular 8177 . However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative suffix &quot;-r&quot; to the base form &quot;Suttung&quot;.

<doc id="1137956" wikidata="Q2736549" url="?curid=1137956" title="Sweet Track">
<text>The Sweet Track is an ancient trackway, or causeway, in the Somerset Levels, England, named after its finder, Ray Sweet. It was built in 3807 BC (determined using dendrochronology - Tree-ring dating) and is the second-oldest timber trackway discovered in the British Isles, dating to the Neolithic. The Sweet Track was predominantly built along the course of an earlier structure, the Post Track.

The track extended across the now largely drained marsh between what was then an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to or around . The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artifacts and prehistoric finds, including a jadeitite ceremonial axe head, have been found in the peat bogs along its length.

Construction was of crossed wooden poles, driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used for a period of only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original, in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.

==Location==
In the early fourth millennium BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick close to the River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were likely to have been similar to those found in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.

The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog; they include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways. Sites such as the nearby Meare Pool provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs around it, particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC), and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud.

The two Meare Lake Villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.

==Discovery and study==
The track was discovered in 1970 during peat excavations and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet. The company for which he worked, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at Cambridge University, who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways. Coles&#x27; interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including English Heritage. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC. The work of John Coles, Bryony Coles, and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.

Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers has enabled precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the discovery in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track&#x27;s timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.

The wood used to build the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment.

In 1973 a jadeitite axehead was found alongside the track; it is thought to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100 similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.

A geophysical survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear magnetometer data; the wood may be influencing the peat&#x27;s hydrology, causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.

==Builders==

The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC, and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.

==Construction==

Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, the track was a walkway consisting mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, driven into the underlying peat. The planks, which were up to wide, long and less than thick, were cut from trees up to 400 years old and in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to long and in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed on top of the first one to bring the plank above it level with the rest of the walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found.

The wetland setting indicates that the track components must have arrived prefabricated, before being assembled on site, although the presence of wood chips and chopped branches indicates that some trimming was performed locally. The track was constructed from about of timber, but Coles estimates that once the materials were transported to the site, ten men could have assembled it in one day.

The Sweet Track was used only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and therefore curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest that it was in daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.

==Conservation==
Most of the track remains in its original location, which is now within the Shapwick Heath biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserve. Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section, several hundred metres of the track&#x27;s length are now being actively conserved. This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare. A section, which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot&#x27;s Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated. Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Somerset Levels Project.

Although the wood recovered from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing the water in the wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.

A section of the track on land owned by Fisons (who extracted peat from the area) was donated to the British Museum in London. Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre near Glastonbury. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 as a result of budget cuts imposed by Somerset County Council. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the Museum of Somerset.

Sections of the track have been designated as a scheduled monument, meaning that it is a &quot;nationally important&quot; historic structure and archaeological site protected against unauthorised change. These sections are also included in Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk Register.

<doc id="1137959" wikidata="Q612720" url="?curid=1137959" title="Creeper (DC Comics)">
<text>The Creeper (Jack Ryder) is a superhero created by Steve Ditko and Don Segall for DC Comics. He is portrayed as a journalist and talk show host, usually living in Gotham City, who gains the ability to transform into the superhuman the Creeper (and vice versa) thanks to experimental science developed by Dr. Yatz. First appearing in &quot;Showcase&quot; #73 (March 1968), his origin was revised in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #18 in 1987, then partially revised again in &quot;The Creeper&quot; #1–4 in 1997, then completely reimagined in the six-issue miniseries &quot;The Creeper&quot; (vol. 2), published in 2006–2007.

Originally, Ryder&#x27;s transformation into the Creeper involved activating a device that granted superhuman abilities while also causing his face to be covered in yellow make-up, his hair to be concealed by a green wig, and his clothing to be instantly replaced by a yellow and red costume with green trunks and a fur-like cape; as the Creeper, Ryder then shifted his voice tone and acted chaotically to intimidate foes and protect his identity. Starting in 1987, it was said Ryder suffered an actual slight change in personality when he became the Creeper, as the device not only empowered him and dressed him in a costume but also altered his brain chemistry. Starting in 1997, Ryder and the Creeper are treated as two personalities sharing the same body. The 2006–2007 miniseries &quot;The Creeper&quot; (vol. 2) presented a new origin. Starting with this story, Ryder&#x27;s transformation no longer involved a costume and is depicted as a physical transformation. Along with his strange appearance, the Creeper is characterized by superhuman strength, agility, healing and stamina, as well as a maniacal laugh. Starting in the 1990s, this laugh has been able to cause pain or immobility in enemies. Through experience and training, the Creeper is a formidable fighter and acrobat. In the &quot;New 52&quot; continuity, a short-lived incarnation of the Creeper was a villain, not a hero, a malicious oni (demon) who inhabited human hosts to create chaos.

The Creeper is a frequent ally of Batman and has been a recurring character in stories involving him. Outside of comics, the Creeper has appeared in the TV shows &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and appeared in his civilian identity Jack Ryder in the &quot;&quot; video game series. The Creeper shares visual similarities to the villain the Joker, but originally no connection was intended and the two characters did not meet until 1975, seven years after the Creeper&#x27;s debut. &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; has the Joker&#x27;s venom involved in the Creeper&#x27;s origin, with the comics following suit.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in &quot;Showcase&quot; #73 (April 1968). Later the same year, the Creeper starred in his own series &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot;, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil (with Steve Ditko plotting the first issue). It lasted six issues. The Creeper repeatedly fought a chameleonic villain called Proteus, whose true identity was revealed just before his violent death in the final issue.

For the next two decades, the Creeper made sporadic appearances in DC Comics stories, often aiding other heroes such as Batman. Most of these stories were written by Denny O&#x27;Neil. The Creeper teamed with Batman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #80 (November 1968), then guested in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #70 (March 1969). He also appeared with Batman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #443 (November 1974), Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975). In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #447–448 (May–June 1975), the Creeper helped Batman prove he had been framed for murder by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul.

In 1975, he met Batman&#x27;s archenemy the Joker for the first time in &quot;The Joker&quot; #3. The story, which featured a character intended to emulate &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz, began with the Creeper being mistakenly blamed for a crime the Joker committed due to their similar appearances (specifically, green hair and a maniacal laugh). Later that year, the hero appeared in &quot;Super-Team Family&quot; #2 and was given a new origin that was not referenced again until later.

The Creeper appeared in a one-off solo story in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #7 (October 1975), penciled by Ditko. He met Wildcat in &quot;Super-Team Family&quot; #2 (January 1976) and reunited with Batman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #143 (October 1978) and 178 (September 1981). He and other stars of &quot;Showcase&quot; appeared in that comic&#x27;s 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published &quot;Showcase&quot; #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko) was later included in &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot; #2 and in &quot;The Creeper by Steve Ditko&quot; hardcover collection published by DC in 2010. The hero also appeared in back-up stories featured in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #445–447 (1976), &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #249–55 (1978–1979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and &quot;The Flash&quot; #318–323 (1983). He teamed up with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #88 (December 1985), written by Steve Englehart.

Following the company-wide crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (1985–1986), DC Comics rebooted large portions of its superhero universe, and many characters were given revised origins or reimagined natures to make them more relevant to modern comic book readers. In &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #18 (1987), in a story presented by Andrew Helfer and Keith Giffen, the Creeper was given a new origin and it was now said Ryder&#x27;s behavior while in costume was not simply an act. In this origin, Ryder is drugged against his will when he is then exposed to Dr. Yatz&#x27;s technology. Whenever he summons his Creeper costume afterward, a side effect is that his mind reverts to the state it was in when he was drugged, thus causing the Creeper&#x27;s strange behavior.

In &quot;Eclipso&quot; #13 in 1993, the Creeper is killed by Eclipso. However, he is revealed to have a powerful healing factor that enables him to survive. In the 1997 series &quot;The Creeper&quot;, written by Len Kaminski, Ryder realizes that before he was ever transformed into the Creeper he possibly had multiple undiagnosed mental illnesses (mentioned are bipolar disorder and an obsessive need for order), apparently inherited from his mother. The series depicted the Creeper as a second personality distinct from his own and occasionally warring for control over their shared body. Ryder also realizes he has repressed the memories of his true origin; the two versions he has recalled before (the original Ditko origin and the Helfer/Giffen origin) were each skewed versions of the truth that his mind found more acceptable. While trying to discover the truth, he fights Proteus again. The series ended in 1998 before the full truth of the Creeper&#x27;s origin could be fully revealed. The series included a special issue #1,000,000, a tie-in to the 1998 crossover &quot;DC One Million&quot;.

In 2003, DC&#x27;s Vertigo Comics imprint released a new miniseries called &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot;. Taking place outside of mainstream DC canon, this story featured Judith and Madeline Benoir, twin sisters living Paris in the 1920s. The story explores their lives and their connection to the Creeper, a mysterious costumed woman who terrorizes a corrupt family.

Following the DC crossover &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005–2006), parts of DC Comics continuity were revised and some characters were given altered histories. Jack Ryder was reintroduced in a follow-up comic &quot;DCU: Brave New World&quot; (2006), in a short story written by Steve Niles and drawn by Justiniano. The story depicted Ryder as a former journalist who now hosted a talk show named &quot;You Are Wrong&quot;, where he often attempted to expose corruption and provide commentary on news events. In narration, Ryder reveals that he has been secretly fighting crime as the Creeper for some time and his transformation is presented as a physical alteration of his body and appearance, not just having a costume, wig and make-up appear on him. Ryder also comments that the Creeper is a separate personality sharing his body, a creature who seems wild and sometimes fights for control of their shared body but is also in some ways more altruistic than the talk show host and whose conscience is now influencing Ryder to be a better person. Later the same year, &quot;The Creeper&quot; (vol. 2) (October 2006 – March 2007), also written by Niles and drawn by Justiniano, featured a flashback story revealing the Creeper&#x27;s newly revised origin, connecting him to the Joker. The idea that Ryder has a mental illness before ever becoming the Creeper is eliminated; this alter ego&#x27;s personality is a result of experimental science affecting his body, mixed with the Joker&#x27;s signature madness-inducing chemical weapons. Batman becomes involved in the story and later gives Ryder a chemical solution that can cure him of the Creeper entirely. Ryder throws away the cure, deciding that he and the Creeper can do more good together.

During the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; miniseries (2008–2009), the Creeper was presented as a demon co-inhabiting the body of Jack Ryder, one of several yellow-skinned demons inhabiting Hell. The same story quickly became notorious among readers for many internal continuity errors and unexplained contradictions with the accepted DC Comics canon, making its place there questionable at best. Following this story, other comics featuring the Creeper once again depicted him as a human who had been altered by science rather than one possessed by a demon.

In the collected edition of &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; (200 pages, DC Comics, June 2010, ; Titan Books, July 2010, ), the Creeper is featured in the story &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot;, written by Keith Giffen with art by Eric Canete.

In 2011, DC Comics rebooted its superhero universe again with &quot;The New 52&quot;. The &quot;New 52&quot; continuity gave a new origin for the Creeper in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; #23.1. The issue portrayed the Creeper as an oni who &quot;justifies cruel temper tantrums under the guise of spreading chaos&quot; and inhabits numerous human hosts, including Jack Ryder. The 2017 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; comic removed many ideas introduced by the &quot;New 52&quot; comics and brought back many ideas and stories published before 2011. Jack Ryder and the Creeper appeared again afterward, now once again depicted as a man who becomes a yellow-skinned superhuman due to scientific experimentation rather than demonic possession.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; ===
Jack Ryder is a former Gotham City resident and is the host of a political talk show. He is fired after criticizing his own sponsors on-air and refusing to change his behavior or apologize. Knowing Ryder is a decent detective, Chief of Network Security Bill Brane hires him as one of his investigators. Brane reveals that CIA contacts have asked him to help find Dr. Yatz, a scientist captured by gangster Angel Devlin. Ryder infiltrates a masquerade party at Devlin&#x27;s mansion and becomes the Creeper after Yatz gives him powers using a chemical serum.

=== Post-Crisis revision ===
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Jack Ryder is depicted as a newspaper journalist working for the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot;. He is shot and left to die while investigating a case, but scientist Emil Yatz rescues him and gives him powers using his experimental &quot;inorganic matter transference&quot; technology.

===Death and rebirth===
In &quot;&quot;, the Creeper is killed by a group of hyenas possessed by Eclipso. However, he is revealed to have a powerful healing factor that enables him to survive. Later, Jack Ryder undergoes therapy and struggles with conflicting memories of his origin.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
Following the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; event, several areas of DC Comics continuity are revised. Jack Ryder is depicted as having been transformed by a combination of Joker venom and smart-skin created by scientist Vincent Yatz. Furthermore, the Creeper is a separate personality who can communicate with Ryder when not active.

===&quot;Reign in Hell&quot;===
In &quot;Reign in Hell&quot;, the Creeper is depicted as a demon who possesses Jack Ryder. It later separates from him and returns to Hell after being summoned by Lilith.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, the Creeper is an oni who resurrects and possesses Jack Ryder after he is killed in an attack on Metropolis. However, his original origin is restored in the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
===&quot;Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===
The Creeper&#x27;s powers are physical in nature as a result of Dr. Yatz&#x27;s discoveries. Jack Ryder transforms himself into the Creeper by holding and pressing the button of a small &quot;activator&quot; device he often keeps it inside his pocket. This activates another device hidden underneath his skin that would rearrange molecules, immediately replacing Ryder&#x27;s clothing with the Creeper&#x27;s costume, yellow make-up, green wig, and red, fur-like cape. This also activates a chemical Dr. Yatz had injected inside Ryder, thus granting him enhanced strength, stamina, durability, speed, agility, reflexes, healing, and senses. When he deactivated his costume, as well as forcing it to disappear, these abilities became dormant. In his Creeper form, he is capable of scaling buildings or climbing walls via acrobatics.

===&quot;Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; ===
This version of the Creeper has the same capabilities as before, but he owes them all to one device implanted in him rather than a chemical agent and two devices. When Jack Ryder first became the Creeper, he is under the influence of drugs. As a result, each time he transforms again, this device not only restores Ryder&#x27;s powers, but it alters his brain chemistry to mimic a distinct personality. After he changes back into his human form, Ryder also has trouble remembering the Creeper&#x27;s actions. Due to being killed by dismemberment via Eclipsed hyenas, the Creeper eventually resurrects himself from death. During that revelation, he can stun or inflict pain upon others with his laughs, as well as frighten them. Ryder is also able to recall some memories of his alter ego.

===&quot;Post-Infinite Crisis&quot;===
In this version of history, Jack Ryder had been injected with &quot;nano-cells&quot;, an experiment intended to create aggressive supersoldiers. This &quot;smart-skin&quot; was created from a combination of stem cell research, nanotechnology, and various Joker Venom chemicals. As a result, Ryder physically transforms into a yellow-skinned, green-haired, and red-maned metahuman with his own distinct personality. These nano-cells can rearrange the molecules of his clothing to become the Creeper&#x27;s costume and vice versa. The Creeper has immense strength, stamina, durability, speed, agility, reflexes, and healing, as well as hyper-keen senses, pain-inducing laughs, and fearful presence. Both alter egos are able to mentally communicate with each other.

<doc id="1137963" wikidata="Q579105" url="?curid=1137963" title="The Suffering (video game)">
<text>The Suffering is a first and third-person shooter horror video game, developed by Surreal Software for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. Stan Winston studios helped with the game&#x27;s design. The game was published by Midway Games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The PC version was published by Encore in North America and by Zoo Digital Publishing in Europe. In North America, the game was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in March 2004, and for PC in June of the same year. In Europe, it was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May, and for PC in July. A port was also planned for the GameCube, but was cancelled. In 2017, the game was released on GOG.com by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the current owner of the IP after acquiring publisher Midway Games&#x27; assets following the latter company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2009.

&quot;The Suffering&quot; centers on the story of Torque, a prisoner on death row for murdering his ex-wife and two children, a crime that he possesses no memory of committing. Shortly after he arrives in Abbot State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland, an earthquake hits the island, resulting in the prison being attacked by supernatural threats from the island&#x27;s past. After being freed, Torque attempts to fight his way to freedom while confronting his own personal demons, all while attempting to remember what really happened to his family. The game features three endings which depend on the players&#x27; gameplay choices throughout, each of which reveals a different version of the murder of Torque&#x27;s family.

&quot;The Suffering&quot; received primarily positive reviews. Some critics felt the blend of action with horror didn&#x27;t work, and that the game was not sufficiently scary, although game designer Richard Rouse III has stated several times that the game is &quot;action horror&quot; as opposed to &quot;survival horror&quot; like &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and &quot;Fatal Frame&quot;. Many also lauded the creature design, the tone, and the game&#x27;s morality system, which determines both the ending and how certain characters interact with Torque during the game. &quot;The Suffering&quot; was a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million units worldwide across all platforms. In 2005, a sequel was released, &quot;The Suffering: Ties That Bind&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Suffering&quot; is an action game in which the player controls Torque, the player character, from either a first-person or third-person perspective, depending on their preference. The game is fully playable in both first and third-person views, with all actions available in both modes. Torque can run, shoot, jump, interact with the environment, interact with NPCs, and use items, such as flashlights, flares, flash grenades, TNT, shrapnel grenades, and molotov cocktails. Weaponry includes a shiv, an axe, a .357 revolver, a tommy gun, dual revolvers, a shotgun, an improvised flamethrower, and M2 Brownings. Other items which can be found during the game are Xombium tablets (which restores the player&#x27;s health), paperwork with story content, maps, ammo, and flashlight batteries.

Most of the enemies in the game are representative of different types of execution methods that have taken place on Carnate Island. Slayers represent decapitation, Marksmen represent death by firing squad, Mainliners represent lethal injection, Noosemen represent hanging, and Burrowers represent being buried alive. Other creatures represent events from Carnate&#x27;s history. Festers are the reincarnation of slave traders who ran their slave ship aground on Carnate, and left their slaves tied up in the hold to be eaten by rats, rather than freeing them. Infernas are the trapped spirits of three children who accused eleven innocent people of being witches during the time of a Puritan settlement on the island. The eleven people were burnt alive. Interestingly these monsters, when not killing humans, are frequently seen fighting and killing each other.
As Torque kills enemies during the game, an on-screen meter called his &quot;Insanity meter&quot; begins to fill. Once it is full, it begins to flash, and at this point, Torque can transform into a monster. In this form, Torque can tear enemies apart and can perform several powerful attacks. The more enemies Torque kills whilst in this form, the more powerful the monster becomes and the more combo moves become available. However, when in this form, Torque&#x27;s health automatically depletes, and if he doesn&#x27;t change back to his human form prior to his health meter fully depleting, he will die.

A major part of the gameplay in &quot;The Suffering&quot; concerns Torque&#x27;s morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque&#x27;s dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque&#x27;s actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time, and can permanently die during gameplay by either Torque&#x27;s doing or the enemies. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque&#x27;s morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque&#x27;s final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque&#x27;s morality level by both Torque&#x27;s own physical appearance (good acts make him appear healthier, evil acts make him appear less human) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil.

==Plot==
The game begins as silent protagonist Torque is being escorted by CO Ernesto Alvarez (voiced by Mark Dias) onto death row in Abbott State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland, an island with a long and troubled history. Torque has been sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and their two children, although he claims to have blacked out during the incident, and can remember nothing. Shortly after entering his cell, an earthquake rocks the prison, and moments later, all of the inmates on death row except Torque are killed by Malefactors, a grotesque race of supernatural creatures manifested from various forms of deaths that took place on Carnate Island and are bent on purging any life they run into. One of the creatures opens Torque&#x27;s cell, and he sets out to escape. After seeing several guards killed by the creatures, Torque uses security monitors to find the entire prison is under attack. He then gets a phone call from his dead wife, Carmen (Rafeedah Keys), telling him the island is more than a prison, that it brings out evil in everyone, and advising him to escape as soon as he can.

Descending to the basement, he soon encounters the spirits of three of Abbot&#x27;s most famous occupants. Dr. Killjoy (voiced by John Armstrong) was a psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an insane asylum on the island in the 1920s. Obsessed with discovering what is wrong with Torque, Killjoy appears as an image projected from 16 mm film projectors. Hermes T. Haight (John Patrick Lowrie) was the executioner in Abbot for twenty-seven years, before he committed suicide in the gas chamber. He appears as a green vapor formed into the shape of a human. Hermes is determined to drive Torque into unleashing the evil inside him. Horace P. Gauge (John Armstrong) was an inmate who was executed in the electric chair for murdering his wife during a conjugal visit. Full of guilt for his actions, he claims Carnate drove him to it, and wants to help Torque realize his decency. He appears in the form of electricity. They teach Torque how to unleash the anger inside himself and transform into a powerful monster, although the transformation is only in Torque&#x27;s mind.

Torque then encounters a fellow inmate, Dallas (Mark Berry), who he knows from his previous prison, Eastern Correctional Institution. They head through the eastern cellblock, where Torque has a vision of Carmen, who explains why she left him; when he was incarcerated for the second time, she knew she needed to make a change to her life. Torque and Dallas make it to the loading bay, and Torque heads to the control room, opening the doors, and allowing Dallas to escape. However, a fire starts, preventing Torque from following. He then hears a call from Consuela Alvarez (Meg Savlov), Ernesto&#x27;s wife, asking Ernesto to call her. She tells him that she and the girls are fine, but there is a fire in the nearby forest getting closer to their house.

Torque heads to the western cellblock, where he has another vision of Carmen, telling him she is pregnant but is filing for divorce. Torque heads to the radio room, finding the radio is working, but something from the asylum is preventing communication with the mainland. Torque heads to the asylum, and encounters Killjoy, who is determined to &quot;cure&quot; him using his &quot;Rebirth Machine&quot;. Torque fights through a series of tests set by Killjoy before destroying all his projectors. Killjoy then tells Torque to return to the prison, where he will give him his diagnosis.

Torque heads back to Abbot by way of the beach, where he encounters Clem (Ross Douglas), an elderly inmate who was in the middle of an escape when the earthquake struck. Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque&#x27;s help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot&#x27;s sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace&#x27;s spirit. Returning to death row, he finds Killjoy&#x27;s diagnosis, and then returns to the radio room. Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate&#x27;s lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel can approach the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using pressurized gas to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto, who is trying to find his family. They restore power, and reactivate the lighthouse, arranging to meet the ship at the dock.

They then head to the nearby village to look for Ernesto&#x27;s family. The gate to town is locked, but in return for freeing his soul, Horace opens it. They then encounter a broken bridge, but, impressed with Torque&#x27;s efforts to kill him, Hermes helps them cross. As they near the village, however, they are separated by a fire, and Ernesto goes on alone, telling Torque to get to the docks. As he arrives, he encounters Killjoy, who tells him to cure himself he must face what awaits him, and only by using the Rebirth Machine can he defeat it. Torque heads to the docks where he encounters a massive creature with a miniature version of himself protruding from its stomach. Torque fights and defeats the creature while remembering the truth about his wife and children&#x27;s deaths, leading to one of three endings, depending on the player&#x27;s actions through the game:

*Good ending: Torque remembers that his wife and children were killed while he was spared by two criminals under orders of a third individual called &quot;The Colonel&quot;, who also incriminated Torque in order to make him suffer. Torque heads to the docks and is picked up by the coast guard. On the boat, the captain recognizes him, and reveals that his case has been reopened after the prosecutor was indicted, and Torque will likely have a retrial. The game ends with the boat sailing away from Carnate.
*Neutral ending: Torque remembers that he accidentally killed his wife during an argument, and, out of revenge, his eldest son drowned his younger brother before killing himself. When the coast guard arrives, Torque knocks him out and commandeers the boat, sailing away from Carnate.
*Bad ending: Torque remembers that he was the one who killed his family after all. When the coast guard arrives, Torque transforms into his monster state and kills him, before running back into the woods of Carnate.

==Development==

===Story and influences===
The origins of &quot;The Suffering&quot; date back to early 2002 when the game was originally called &quot;&quot;Unspeakable&quot;.&quot; Surreal Software game designer Richard Rouse III wrote a two-page pitch, which described the game as &quot;a stylized horror shooter; with the frenetic gameplay of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; meets the horror setting of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and the immersive game-world of &quot;Half-Life&quot;.&quot; The basic design for the game originated from Rouse&#x27;s negative experiences working on a western role-playing game called &quot;Gunslinger&quot;, which was eventually cancelled. Rouse felt &quot;Gunslinger&quot; had been too ambitious for its own good, especially a &quot;morality system&quot; which saw entire towns full of people react differently to the player character depending on what actions the player had taken earlier in the game. Finding this system impossible to implement effectively, Rouse envisioned &quot;The Suffering&quot; as having a &quot;drastically stripped down morality system&quot; with a much simpler AI system for tracking it.

In looking for early inspiration for the game, the developers turned to horror films, with the team universally agreeing that their favorite such film was Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;. According to Rouse,

The influence of &quot;The Shining&quot;, and other horror films, also influenced how the developers handled the basic storyline, especially Torque&#x27;s backstory;

===Gameplay and design===
An early decision on Rouse&#x27;s part was that &quot;The Suffering&quot; be more of an action game than a traditional survival horror. This had implications for much of the design work on the game, as &quot;it meant we were going to focus more on combat and avoid the long cutscenes, frail central characters, clumsy controls, fixed camera angles, and sparse ammo of many console horror games.&quot; Another early decision was to keep the central character as much of a mystery as possible, implying only his strength and little else. Artist Mike Nichols says, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really want a character that looked of any particular nationality or race. He really is almost Neanderthal in appearance. He&#x27;s very primal. We wanted that strength to come through.&quot;

Creature design was also an important element in the development process, with the team determined to create a unique array of enemies. According to Rouse,

After the team had done their initial creature design for the game, they sent their work to Stan Winston Studios, where Terry Wolfinger took the preexisting designs and finessed them, changed colors, added details etc. to make them more unsettling, referred to as &quot;Stan Winstonizing them.&quot; However, it was also important that the creatures, and the game as a whole, have a real world basis, so as to enhance the horror. Rouse explains,

===Game mechanics===
An important element in the design process was what Rouse refers to as &quot;player-empowerment;&quot; allowing players a great deal of freedom within the game world. A key concept in this was that the player&#x27;s actions would work to determine the guilt or innocence of Torque;

A great deal of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game originally had a target-lock system, based on the controls in &quot;Syphon Filter&quot; and &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on &quot;PC-style shooters&quot; such as &quot;Half Life&quot;, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, &quot;with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development we realized we had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun.&quot; However, with the release of successful console third-person shooters such as &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Frontline&quot;, and &quot;SOCOM&quot;, all of which &quot;eschewed target-lock in favor of double-stick control schemes that simulated the mouse/keyboard experience from the PC&quot;, the team decided to scrap their target-lock system and go with a free aim system; &quot;looking at the sales for these titles, we concluded the installed base of players who were familiar with these controls was now large enough that we could take the risk of turning off a few newbies. The change was a huge success for the game: it fixed the disconnect in our gameplay and added depth that had been completely missing.&quot;

===Announcement and promotion===
The game was unofficially revealed on March 17, 2003, when Midway Games sent a list of upcoming games out to retailers. The list included &quot;The Suffering&quot;, which was described as &quot;action-horror game set inside a prison&quot;. The game was slated for an October 2003 release for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. Midway officially announced the game on April 15, calling it an &quot;action-packed survival horror game set in a maximum security prison&quot;. Helene Sheeler, vice president of marketing for Midway stated, &quot;&quot;The Suffering&quot; redefines terror with a chilling look into a penitentiary haunted by apparitions of executed prisoners grotesquely reincarnated as the methods of executions that befell them.&quot; It was also revealed the creatures in the game were designed by Stan Winston Studios.

Several days later, Midway revealed the game&#x27;s fictional prison, Abbot State Penitentiary, located on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland was partially based on Alcatraz, located on Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco. In the game, Abbot had been built from the remains of a World War II army base, whereas Alcatraz was originally a military prison. They also revealed the game would be M-rated, and the 3D game engine would draw the locations in real-time (as opposed to the 2D pre-rendered backgrounds found in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games). The game was first previewed at the E3 event in May.

In September, Midway announced the game was being pushed back from October 2003 to early 2004. Of the delay, Richard Rouse III wrote,

In October, Midway ran a promotional event in West Virginia State Penitentiary. A defunct gothic prison that is supposedly haunted, game journalists spent the night in the facility with representatives from Midway and Surreal Software. A demo of the game was available in the cafeteria of the building. On October 28, Midway announced the GameCube version had been cancelled, explaining &quot;we want to concentrate on the leading platforms in the marketplace when it comes to launching original product. We are still publishing titles like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Hitz&quot; for the Nintendo GameCube, but for &quot;The Suffering&quot; we are concentrating on the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox.&quot;

The game went gold on February 23, 2004, with a North American release date set for March 8. David Zucker, Midway&#x27;s CEO, projected revenues of $140 million for the fiscal year of 2004, an increase of over 50% from that of 2003. CFO Thomas Powell stated the targets were based primarily on the company&#x27;s high hopes for &quot;The Suffering&quot;, and their &quot;second tier of titles&quot;, including &quot;NBA Ballers&quot;, &quot;MLB Slugfest&quot;, and &quot;Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy&quot;, as well as titles coming later in 2004 such as &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, &quot;Area 51&quot;, and &quot;NARC&quot;.

On May 5, Encore announced they would be releasing the game for Windows at the end of the month.

===Musical score===
The music for &quot;The Suffering&quot; was composed by Erik Aho, who had previously worked with Surreal Software on &quot;&quot;. The original concept for the music and sound design was proposed by lead sound designer Boyd Post. The concept entailed creating &quot;instruments&quot; out of objects found in the environments depicted in the game, and using them to create both the sound design and the music, which would organically intertwine with one another. According to Post,

Erik Aho further explains,

Instruments were also created by Seattle musician/instrument designer Ela Lamblin. These included a Stamenphone (&quot;a sort of cross between a waterphone and a tambura that can be bowed to create droning tonal melodies or struck for a percussive metallic resonating sound&quot;) and Orbacles (&quot;hollow metal pods large enough to fit a person inside. These could be struck to create percussive impacts, bowed with superballs to create moaning ambiences and played like congas to create rhythms&quot;). These were combined with other objects such as hubcaps, railroad spikes, hammers and glass jars. Metal rods &quot;were about 8-10 feet long and were played by rubbing rosin-coated gloves lengthwise along the rods. These created otherworldly drones that were later put into a sampler, pitched up and down and layered to create ambiences. The rods were also struck to create violent shrieks and metallic percussive sounds.&quot; A mounted bicycle wheel &quot;was played by cranking the wheel and scraping different objects across the spokes.&quot;

Even strange events from the recording sessions at Robert Lange Studios made it onto the track. For example, according to Aho;

Of the music as a whole, Aho says,

===Digital distribution===
In October 2008, the PC version of the game was released as freeware by the United States Air Force on FileFront (no longer available). On September 8, 2017, both &quot;The Suffering&quot; and &quot;The Suffering: Ties That Bind&quot; were released on GOG.com as DRM-free titles. On September 1, 2024, both games were removed from GOG.com, as requested by Warner Bros. Interactive.

==Reception==
&quot;The Suffering&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;; the PC version holds an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-six reviews; the PlayStation 2 version 77 out of 100, based on forty-seven reviews; the Xbox version 77 out of 100, based on forty-four reviews.

&quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot;″s Joe Rybicki scored the PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5, arguing it was not scary due to it being an action game, as opposed to a survival-horror. He wrote &quot;if &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; is the gaming equivalent of &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;The Suffering&quot; is &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.&quot; Although he praised the morality system and the general gameplay, he concluded &quot;I felt the psychological elements and the morality-play overtones were largely wasted on what is at its most fundamental level a fairly run-of-the-mill shooter.&quot;

Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Bramwell scored the PlayStation 2 version 7 out of 10. As with Rybicki, he felt the blend of action and horror elements didn&#x27;t really work; &quot;in trying to mix horror and action, &quot;The Suffering&quot; sets itself up for failure [...] once you shake off the anxiety you&#x27;ve been trained to associate with survival horror and just get on with it, it becomes something of a slog.&quot; However, he felt the game did feature &quot;some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights.&quot; He further wrote &quot;Certainly it&#x27;s been well designed in places.&quot; However, he concluded &quot;&quot;The Suffering&quot; has some scary moments, but for the most part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It&#x27;s a shame, because &quot;The Suffering&quot; could have been great. We&#x27;re not asking for a carbon copy of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; or &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, but with a little more consideration, Surreal could have remoulded the experience a lot more effectively.&quot;

GameSpot&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann scored the game 7.6 out of 10, writing &quot;it might be a little too straightforward in spots, but it does make for a solid action game.&quot; He concluded that &quot;although &quot;The Suffering&quot; tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying to scare you, it&#x27;s still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [But] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, &quot;The Suffering&quot; is a fun action game.&quot;

GameSpy&#x27;s David Hodgson scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3 out of 5, calling the game &quot;&quot;Oz&quot; meets Clive Barker, drenched in the entrails of Stephen King. It&#x27;s survival-horror with swears. It&#x27;s the proof the ESRB is kidding Congress with the non-existent &quot;Adults Only&quot; rating. It&#x27;s offensive, psyche-damaging, brutal, makes no sense, and is unforgiving and violent. And damn good fun.&quot; Scott Osborne scored the PC version 4 out of 5, writing &quot;&quot;The Suffering&quot; offers a smooth blend of survival horror and shooter action.&quot; Of the PC port, he wrote &quot;you&#x27;ll find a few bugs, clipping problems, and occasional clunky moments when a character&#x27;s important dialogue is interrupted by that of a scripted event, creating an audio muddle. It&#x27;s a shame &quot;The Suffering&quot; didn&#x27;t receive a bit more polishing and a major graphics upgrade for the PC. Still, with its well-designed levels, fluid pacing, and hyper-violent combat in eerie locales, &quot;The Suffering&quot; is a fun way to safely tap into your dark side.&quot;

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Jeremy Zoss scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.25 out of 10, writing &quot;if titles like &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then &quot;The Suffering&quot; is the equivalent of a splatter flick.&quot; He concluded &quot;while I have many positive things to say about this title, I cannot stress enough that it&#x27;s not for everyone. Like a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson&#x27;s true masterpiece is &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, you&#x27;ll be right at home with &quot;The Suffering&quot;.&quot;

IGN&#x27;s Aaron Boulding scored the game 8.5 out of 10, giving the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; award. He called it &quot;a great game, not just a great horror game&quot;, writing &quot;it succeeds as both a horrific thrill ride and fun action experience.&quot; He concluded &quot;In a genre that&#x27;s overrun with sequels and lame attempts at horror, &quot;The Suffering&quot; is a breath of fresh death rattle. The action is intense, the creatures are actually creepy, and the story does not shy away from truly macabre elements. One cannot say enough about the horrific world that&#x27;s been created here. Everywhere you look, every little thing you do, has been placed there to ratchet up the suspense and put you in an eerie state of mind.&quot;

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;The Suffering&quot; for &quot;Computer Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;The Suffering&quot; was a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million units worldwide across all platforms. The game was also credited with putting Midway &quot;back on the map&quot; as a major video game publisher after several years of games underperfoming.

In April, Midway announced their projected revenue for the first quarter of 2004 was $18 million, primarily due to the success of &quot;The Suffering&quot;. On April 6, Midway purchased Surreal Software. Midway CEO David Zucker stated &quot;The positive market reception to &quot;The Suffering&quot; illustrates our ability to successfully develop and release entirely new properties that resonate strongly with the growing audience of sophisticated, mature gamers. The acquisition of Surreal Software Inc., the visionary developer behind &quot;The Suffering&quot;, strengthens our internal product development team and reinforces our ability to create high quality games.&quot; Surreal&#x27;s co-founder, and &quot;The Suffering&quot;″s director Alan Patmore stated &quot;We developed a great working relationship with Midway during the development of &quot;The Suffering&quot; and feel that partnering with them will allow us to increase the quality of our titles by providing us with additional resources--and by allowing us to leverage their resources and expertise. It&#x27;s that simple. We just want to make great games and feel that the acquisition will help us accomplish this goal.&quot;

==Film==
On September 8, 2005, Midway and MTV Films announced a film adaptation based on both &quot;The Suffering&quot; and &quot;The Suffering: Ties That Bind&quot; was in development. Stan Winston had signed on to work on the project, with producers Jason Lust and Rick Jacobs. No writers, actors or directors had yet been approached. However, there have since been no further developments, with the project presumably cancelled.

<doc id="1137968" wikidata="Q1021170" url="?curid=1137968" title="Tillicoultry">
<text>Tillicoultry ( ; Scottish Gaelic: Tulach Cultraidh, perhaps from older Gaelic &quot;Tullich-cul-tir&quot;, or &quot;the mount/hill at the back of the country&quot;) is a town in Clackmannanshire, Scotland. Tillicoultry is usually referred to as Tilly by the locals.

One of the Hillfoots Villages on the A91, which runs from Stirling to St. Andrews, Tillicoultry is situated at the southern base of the Ochil Hills, which provide a spectacular backdrop. The River Devon lies to the south. The river also runs through neighbouring villages Dollar and Alva to the east and west respectively. The former mining village of Coalsnaughton lies just south, whilst Alloa lies southwest.

The &quot;hill&quot; referred to in the first etymology is likely to be Kirkhill, at the east of the town. The alternative Latin etymology, &quot;Tellus culta&quot;, the cultivated land, suggested by Rev. William Osborne, minister of the parish from 1773 to 1794, is also possible. However, as both etymologies could equally be applied to many places in Scotland, both are suspect, as neither define the town in a unique manner.

==History==
The estate of Tillicoultry was taken from Aleumus de Meser in 1261 by Alexander III for failure to render due feudal services. The estate had originally been received by de Meser&#x27;s father, also Aleumus, from Alexander II. It was then granted to William Count of Mar and remained in possession of the Mar, and then by marriage of Margaret, Countess of Mar, to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, the Douglas family until 1483, when it changed hands to the ancestors of Lord Colville of Culross. By 1634 it was sold to Sir William Alexander of Menstrie (later, 1st Earl of Stirling). Between 1644 and 1840, ownership of the estate changed hands frequently.

The origins of the village lie in the Westertown (previously Cairnstown) area, where the road to Stirling crossed the Tillicoultry Burn. It is thought that the centre of Westertown was probably in the area now known as Shillinghill.

There are records of a Parish church existing in Tillicoultry from 1639, and knowledge of cloth manufacture dating from the 1560s. Traces of a Druid circle, sixty feet in diameter, were found in the eastern area of the parish at the end of the 18th century. A Pictish fortress stood upon the Castle Craig, near the current site of Craigfoot Quarry on Wood Hill, to the west of Tillicoultry Glen. This has long since been ruined, however legend has it that the stone of the fortress was employed in the building of Stirling Castle.

Due to the rapid growth of the village during the 19th century, there were problems with overcrowding, poor housing, high infant mortality, water supply and drainage. In an attempt to address these problems, Tillicoultry Burgh was created in 1871. It lasted until 1975 when it disappeared as a result of local government reorganisation.

Around 1930, one of the first bus stations in the country was built at Murray Square to serve the eight bus services which terminated in the town. The original glass and cast iron shelters were replaced by modern shelters some time ago. Despite the growth in car ownership and the corresponding decline in public transport, Tillicoultry, and indeed all the Hillfoots villages, retain a regular bus service.

The old Harviestoun estate, where Archibald Tait (1811–82), Archbishop of Canterbury, spent much of his boyhood, lies East-North-East of the village. Robert Burns visited the estate in the summer of 1787, during his stay he wrote &quot;The Banks of the Devon&quot; and &quot;Fairest Maid on Devon Banks&quot;. A commemorative cairn at the roadside, near the east lodge to Harviestoun, marks this event.

===Industry===

The burn which runs off the Ochils and down through the glen into west of the village provided an attractive source of water for the early textile industry in Tillicoultry, being used for the washing and dying of wool. During the early 18th century a cloth known as Tillicoultry Serge was manufactured by weaving worsted with linen.

By the time of the Industrial Revolution the burn was a recognised source of power, with the first mill being established in the 1790s. Many more textile mills were built along the burnside, by the 1830s, steam powered mills were introduced and by 1870 there were 12 mills employing over 2000 people. As the industry expanded, more workers were attracted to the village. The population of the parish, which had stood less than 1,000 at the turn of the 19th century, had grown to over 4,500 by the early 1850s.

Textile mills and coal mines remained the biggest employers of the local population until the first half of the 20th century. In the 1950s the most recent colliery to be worked, on the south bank of the River Devon, set new productivity records due to a high level of mechanisation. Its impressive adit entrance, now safely bricked up, can still be seen. In 1851, due to the importance of Tillicoultry as an industrial centre, it became the first Hillfoots village to have a rail connection.

In 1921 Samuel Jones Limited established a paper mill at Devonvale, the current site of Sterling Furniture. In 1926, 33 people were employed at the site and the firm returned its first profit. By 1936, 238 staff were employed by the company. Sydney Platfoot was appointed Managing Director of the Devonvale works in 1922, he later went on to become town provost from 1930 to 1936. In 1964, the company merged with Wiggins Teape and by 1967 employed a fifth of the working population.

Tillicoultry Quarries Ltd, as the name suggests, was established in 1930 by R.W. Menzies at Craigfoot Quarry Tillicoultry, and remains 100% owned by the Menzies family. Quarrying no longer takes places in Tillicoultry; the company&#x27;s Head office is based in nearby Kincardine.

Quartz-dolerite was first extracted in 1930 from the now inoperative Craigfoot Quarry (map), however quarrying had taken place on a smaller scale at the site since 1880. On 26 January 1949 the quarry was the site of a tragic explosion when a magazine containing 150 lb of explosive detonated killing quarryman Alexander Honeyman and blowing out doors and windows in the Shillinghill and Upper Mill Street area.

===The Flood of 1877===

Following a particularly wet summer and torrential rainfall over a 12-hour period, Tillicoultry Burn burst its banks on the morning of 28 August 1877. Flooding was widespread throughout Strathdevon, both Alloa Railway station and Alloa Brewery were submerged, crops were destroyed around Tullibody and there was extensive property damage in Dollar also. The Alloa Advertiser described the rainfall as &#x27;not simply heavy rain; it was a terrific downpour- persistent, incessant, it fell in bucketfuls- to use our expressive vernacular it came down like &quot;hale water&quot;&#x27;.

Workers in mills to the west side of the burn were trapped in their workplaces, unable to cross Mill Street due to the flood water. By breakfast time the houses and shops of High Street were under three feet of water.

Three people, Castle Mill owner William Hutchison, dyer William Stillie and Isabella Miller, a young factory worker, were swept away when the bridge on which they were standing collapsed into the flood waters. The collapse was probably due to the impact of water-borne debris upon the embankment on which the foundation of the bridge stood. Both William Hutchison and Isabella Miller perished in the torrent, however William Stillie was rescued further downstream. Despite exhaustive searches, Isabella Miller&#x27;s body was not recovered for several days. It was eventually discovered at Glenfoot, where the burn joins the River Devon.

The village was deprived of water and gas supplies for a week following the flood. The cost of repairs to the Burnside amounted to £2,000.

==The village today==

As the textile and coal mining industries declined, Tillicoultry became a popular commuter town. Many of the mill buildings have been converted into residential accommodation. Tillicoultry railway station, on the Devon Valley Railway was situated opposite Devonvale Hall, and closed in 1964.

The Clock Mill, built by James and George Walker of Galashiels, is situated at the top of Upper Mill Street. The last production of textiles in the mill was by D. C. Sinclair &amp; Son. They wove high quality mohair goods among others. It was turned into a museum, then a business centre and now residential flats.

The village developed on a herring-bone pattern north of the main road. A series of diagonal streets, mostly lined with cottages, lie between the High Street and Walker Terrace, which run parallel. The eastern area of the village has more recent residential developments, dating from the 1940s to the present.

Tillicoultry is perhaps now best known for its large retail outlet, Sterling Furniture, based in the former Devonvale paper mill complex, as well as for the adjacent Sterling Mills shopping centre.

The Devon Way walkway links eastward to Dollar.

The village also has a 400-pupil Primary School, which is situated next to the Fir Park artificial ski slope. For secondary school aged children, the closest school is Alva Academy.

==Notable people==
* Captain J D Pollock, a First World War soldier awarded the Victoria Cross, was born in the village.
* Major J L Dawson, awarded the Victoria Cross in the same action as Pollock, was also born in the village. Dawson and Pollock were second cousins.

<text>U.S. Route 276 (US 276) is a United States highway that runs for from Mauldin, South Carolina to Cove Creek, North Carolina. It is known both as a busy urban highway in Greenville, South Carolina and a scenic back-road in Western North Carolina. Despite its numbering, it does not intersect its parent route U.S. Route 76.

==Route description==
===South Carolina===
In South Carolina, US 276 only runs in Greenville County, for a total of ; beginning at the I-385/I-185 junction in Mauldin. The US Highway then runs north to the City of Greenville, then to Travelers Rest, and then Marietta before climbing into North Carolina.
A two-mile portion of US 276 between Greenville and Travelers Rest is an expressway complete with shoulders, exits, a grass median, and a speed limit of 55 miles per hour.

In Travelers Rest, a Downtown Revitalization Plan has reduced US 276 from four lanes down to two; added trees, on-street parking, a new park, and other improvements.

After Marietta, US 276 climbs about to Caesars Head State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains, from the North Carolina border. At the border, the US Highway crosses the Eastern Continental Divide at above sea level.

===North Carolina===
In North Carolina, US 276 traverses through Transylvania and Haywood counties, for a total of . Between the towns of Brevard and Waynesville in North Carolina, US 276 travels through the Pisgah National Forest and is a route heavily traveled by recreationalists. The road follows the Davidson River and a tributary upstream before climbing the Pisgah Ridge and crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway at its top, then descending by the Pigeon River and the Shining Rock Wilderness. Many trailheads used for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding lie along US 276 in this area and roads connecting to it. Drivers will also find roadside campgrounds, picnic areas, waterfalls, and two museums — the Pisgah Center for Wildlife Education and the Cradle of Forestry in America — along the road or within a short distance of it. North of Waynesville, US 276 continues through Lake Junaluska, where it joins US 19 to Maggie Valley, then runs north to I-40 at Cove Creek.

US 276 is signed east–west in South Carolina and north–south in North Carolina; which is why it is listed as having an eastern and northern terminus.

US 276 overlaps with the Forest Heritage Scenic Byway, which is a North Carolina Scenic Byway, National Forest Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that traverses between Pisgah Forest and Woodrow.

==History==

US 276 was established in 1932, traversing from Laurens, South Carolina to Brevard, North Carolina; it replaced US 76 between Laurens to Greenville, overlapped with US 25 to Travelers Rest, replaced SC 284/NC 284 to Brevard.

Around 1939, US 276 was extended north from Brevard, via Pisgah Forest along the old Pisgah Motor Road, to Waynesville, ending at Main Street. In the 1940s, US 276 was changed to its current routing around the downtown area of Greenville, which established US 276 Business by 1948; the business route would be later replaced by I-85 Business by 1968-70.

In 1957 or 1958, US 276 was moved onto new freeway south of Mauldin to just south of Fountain Inn; its old route was replaced by SC 417 between Mauldin-Simpsonville and SC 14 to Fountain Inn. Between 1959-61, US 276&#x27;s realignment onto new freeway was complete with a connection with I-26 in Clinton, the remainder of its former route to Laurens was replaced by SC 14.

Also around 1959, US 276 was extended north again to Lake Junaluska, North Carolina, replacing another section of NC 284. By 1968, a widened 4-lane road was completed between Dellwood and Cove Creek, completing a temporary connection between two completed sections of I-40. This section became the final extension north of US 276, replacing the last remaining section NC 284; temporary I-40 lasted till 1974 (when the section between exits 20-27 was completed).

Around 1985, the Mauldin-Clinton freeway was renumbered to I-385; truncating US 276 to its current eastern terminus in Mauldin.
===North Carolina Highway 284===

NC 284 was a former state highway in the Mountains Region of the state of North Carolina. Its routing through the Great Smoky Mountains was demoted to Old NC 284 (Cove Creek Road) and today remains primitive road; it is thus unpaved and is maintained by the National Park Service. The rest of the old route, which lies to the south, was replaced segment by segment by U.S. Highway 276 from 1939 to 1968, when the last section from Maggie Valley north to the newly constructed Interstate 40 in Cove Creek was replaced by the U.S. highway.

===Travelers Rest connector===

U.S. Route 276 Connector (US 276 Conn.) is a connector route, in concurrency with US 25 Conn., along Poinsett Highway. It connects US 276 with US 25, in downtown Travelers Rest. Not only is the highway unsigned, it is not even shown on SCDOT&#x27;s Greenville metro area map, so the highway may be decommissioned.

<text>Totteridge &amp; Whetstone () is a London Underground station in Whetstone in the London Borough of Barnet, North London. It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between High Barnet and Woodside Park stations, in . It was first built in 1872.

It is on the north side of Totteridge Lane (A5109), to the east of the Dollis Brook, the traditional boundary between Totteridge and Whetstone, so narrowly in the latter.

==History==

The Totteridge &amp; Whetstone station was planned by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) and was originally opened on 1 April 1872 by the Great Northern Railway (which had taken over the EH&amp;LR). The station was on a branch of a line whose main part ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate.

After the Railways Act 1921 created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies the line was, from 1923, part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The section of the High Barnet branch north of East Finchley was incorporated into the London Underground network through the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; project which began in the late 1930s. Totteridge and Whetstone station was first served by Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 and, after a period where the station was serviced by both operators, LNER services ended in 1941.

British Railways (the successor to the LNER) freight trains continued to serve the station&#x27;s goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed and converted into station’s car park.

==Station facilities==
The station retains much of its original Victorian architectural character today. The station is not wheelchair accessible owing to flights of stairs to the two platforms.

The station has in the 21st century undergone subtle changes to enable the policy of no ticket offices, chiefly: 
*an automatic double-wide access, disabled and buggy-friendly barrier
*A help desk instead of the ticket office.

The station is not often staffed but is during peak hours. The station has a passenger hall, four gates, two toilets (a female toilet on the southbound platform and a male toilet on the northbound platform), a car park and waiting rooms.

==Services and connections==
The typical offpeak service at this station in trains per hour is as follows:

* 16tph Northbound to High Barnet
* 8tph Southbound to Battersea via Charing Cross
* 8tph Southbound to Morden via Bank

London Bus routes 34, 125, 234, 251, 263, 326, 383, 605, 626, 628, 634 and 688 and night route N20 serve the station.

<text>Tredegar (; ) is a town and community situated on the banks of the Sirhowy River in the county borough of Blaenau Gwent, in the southeast of Wales. Within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire, it became an early centre of the Industrial Revolution in Wales. The relevant wards (Tredegar Central and West, Sirhowy and Georgetown) collectively listed the town&#x27;s population as 15,103 in the UK 2011 census.

== The origin of the name &#x27;Tredegar&#x27;==
Tredegar was originally part of the Tredegar Estate, the seat of which was in Coedcernyw, outside Newport, and which extended northwards to include almost the entire length of the Sirhowy Valley. Local historian Oliver Jones (1969) writes that, by c.1803, the new town that had been created after the completion of the Furnace No 3 of the local iron works:

...was becoming known far and wide as &quot;Tredegar Iron Works&quot; and not as &quot;Tredegar&quot; as would be expected, the town not having or being allowed to have an identity apart from the industry that sustained it. And as Tredegar Iron Works it continued to be known for many years. Tombstones in the old Cholera Cemetery on Cefn Golau describe the victims of the 1832 and 1848 epidemics as &quot;natives of the Tredegar Iron Works&quot; and as late as the 1860&#x27;s letters were still being addressed, for example, to &quot;Mr. John Lewis, East Lane, Tredegar Iron Works.&#x27; (op. cit.: 41) 

The previous analysis is supplemented by the fact that company&#x27;s buildings appeared on the 1832 Ordnance Survey map as &#x27;Tredegar Iron Works&#x27;. Jones didn&#x27;t state when the name of the new town was shortened to &#x27;Tredegar&#x27;. But when its name was shortened, it resulted in the existence of two Tredegars, one at each end of the estate: one at the top of the Sirhowy Valley and the other outside Newport.

In 1881 Octavius Morgan, the fourth son of Sir Charles Morgan of Tredegar, had published his etymology of the name of his ancestral home, which he had republished in 1886. He divided his etymology into two parts, about the Welsh adjective &#x27;tref&#x27; and the noun &#x27;degar&#x27;. He began by dismissing four derivations of &#x27;tref&#x27;: &#x27;the foot of the camp&#x27;, &#x27;ten plough-lands&#x27;, &#x27;ten acres&#x27; and &#x27;two forts&#x27;, which he described as &#x27;conjectural&#x27;. He then proposed his derivation, which he described as &#x27;most obvious&#x27; and &#x27;the true one&#x27; – that &#x27;tref&#x27; means &#x27;the dwelling place, chief mansion, or homestead of some important person&#x27;. Morgan then cited a poem, a manuscript and a pedigree in support of his proposal that &#x27;degar&#x27; was derived from an historical personage called &#x27;Teigr&#x27;, whose name was changed to &#x27;Deigr&#x27; to enable euphony (see the entry for the term in Phonaesthetics), which in turn was styled as &#x27;degyr, which then in another context presumably became &#x27;Degar&#x27;.

Bartrum (2009, originally 1993) explicitly concurred with Octavius Morgan in the entry for &quot;Deigr ap Dyfnwal Hen (Legendary)&quot; in his &quot;A Welsh Classical Dictionary&quot;, while 
Osborne and Hobbs (1992) and Owen and Morgan (2007) implicitly did so.

In the local Welsh dialect known as Gwenhwyseg, the name was often pronounced as &quot;Tredecar&quot; (with provection of /g/ to /k/). There was also a shortened form &quot;Decar&quot;.

== History ==

=== Industrialisation ===
Tredegar became industrialised because the local availability of easily accessible iron ore and the three natural resources which enabled iron production: 
* wood, which was used to produce charcoal as a fuel
* coal, which was used to produce coke as a fuel
* water, from the fast-flowing Sirhowy River, which could be used for scouring (separating the topsoil from the underlying iron ore).

There is disagreement about the date when the first furnace was built locally. In his 1903 &quot;History of the iron, steel, tinplate and ... other trades of Wales&quot;, Charles Wilkins described a charcoal-fired furnace, Pont Gwaith yr Haiarn [alternatively &#x27;Hearn&#x27;] (&#x27;the bridge iron works&#x27;), four miles south of Tredegar, as &#x27;one of the oldest places on the hills for ironmaking.&#x27; He cited in support of his description the Rev. R. Ellis (&#x27;Cynddelw&#x27;), who had claimed, &#x27;many years ago&#x27;, that old inhabitants &#x27;fixed the earliest date of working there as at the close of seventeenth century, probably about 1690.&#x27; (ibid.)

In contrast, local author David Morris (&#x27;Eiddil Gwent&#x27;) related in his &quot;Hanes Tredegar&quot; his conversation with an old lady, &#x27;Mrs Thomas&#x27;, who told him that her father and husband&#x27;s relations had worked in the furnace at Pont Gwaith yr Hearn, next to the Sirhowy River, four miles south of Tredegar. The furnace was developed by two Bretons and worked by men from Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil. Morris concluded that they had built the furnace &#x27;about the year 1738 or 1739.&#x27;

Local historian Oliver Jones cast doubt on the claim of David Morris in his 1969 book &quot;The early days of Sirhowy and Tredegar&quot;. He commented that &quot;when the Bretons arrived in 1738 they simply took over a works which had been in existence for many years.&quot;

There is also disagreement about the next furnace that was built locally, the coal-fired Sirhowy Furnace. Evan Powell claimed in his 1884 &quot;History of Tredegar&quot; that it was erected &#x27;a few years&#x27; after the closure of the Pont Gwaith yr Hearn furnace, by a Mr Kettle of Shropshire. Oliver Jones also cast doubt on this claim. He commented: &#x27;neither maps nor documents support [Powell] ... Nor does Kettle, the name of the man who is supposed to have built it at that time, appear anywhere in the records.&#x27;

However, there is agreement that a furnace was built &#x27;near the confluence of Nant Melin brook and the river Sirhowy at the place then called Aber-Sirhowy&#x27; in 1778, by manual workers who were hired by a consortium of four men: Thomas Atkinson, a merchant from York, and three businessmen from London, William Barrow, Bolton Hudson and John Sealy, who were &#x27;involved in the tea and grocery trade&#x27;. The consortium secured a forty-year lease on local lands from Charles Henry Burgh, who had inherited the estate of his father, the Rev. Henry Burgh. It employed miners who drove coal levels into the hillsides at Bryn Bach and Nantybwch, the first small-scale coal mining operation in the area, for the coal-fired furnace. (Oliver Jones documented that, from the mid-1780s, &#x27;coal mining became more systematic and much better organised&#x27;.) Other trades that the consortium employed included furnacemen, furnace helpers, smiths, cokers, masons and mule drivers.

===Tredegar Ironworks===

In 1797, Samuel Homfray, with partners Richard Fothergill and Matthew Monkhouse, built a new furnace, leasing the land from the Tredegar Estate in Newport. This created the new Sirhowy Ironworks, that were in 1800 to become the Tredegar Iron Company, named in honour of the Tredegar Estate at Tredegar House and Tredegar Park in Newport in the south of the county. Before 1800, Tredegar &#x27;contained only three houses&#x27;.

In 1891, the company ceased production of iron, but continued to develop coal mines and produce coal. The former Tredegar Ironworks were effectively abandoned, with Whiteheads taking over the southern section of the site from 1907. In 1931, they also closed down their operations, moving everything to their Newport works. TICC continued to develop coal mines and work pits, until it was nationalised in 1946, becoming part of the National Coal Board.

The Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia, United States was named in honour of the town.

=== Tredegar Circle ===

Samuel Homfray, an iron master who managed to obtain a large parcel of land in and around Tredegar, is to be thanked for Tredegar Circle and the wide streets running out from it. He showed a great concern about the state of the current streets and how narrow they were, deciding that his new town would have wide streets running out from a central place. Tredegar Circle was first known as &#x27;The Square&#x27;, but as buildings and shops developed around it people within Tredegar began to refer to it as &#x27;The Circle&#x27;.

The town clock which stands in the middle of Tredegar Circle was once where the town stocks resided, with there being records of people being put into the stocks to be punished for petty misdemeanours. People being punished within the stocks would have their legs trapped in the stocks, being kept outside for hours in all weather conditions.

Prostitution was rife within Tredegar Circle, almost having a reputation of being a &#x27;red light district&#x27; in the earlier days.

Tredegar Circle was also seen as being an important &#x27;shopping centre&#x27;, many local tradespeople would go there to set up stalls and sell their wares to the people within Tredegar, before the town clock was erected. Horses and carts loaded with goods would clatter around Tredegar Circle, with almost every type of produce being available to buy within Tredegar Circle. Tredegar Town Hall, a prominent building in The Circle, was rebuilt in 1892.

Tredegar Circle is also known for the pubs that occupy it, although there have been many that have closed down over the years such as the Greyhound Inn and the Freemasons, both once very popular with local workers. There have been many reported arrests within Tredegar Circle, in both present and earlier days, due to drunken and disorderly behaviour.

==Welsh language==
According to the 2011 Census, 5.4% of Tredegar Central and West&#x27;s 6,063 (328 residents) resident-population can speak, read, and write Welsh. This is below the county&#x27;s figure of 5.5% of 67,348 (3,705 residents) who can speak, read, and write Welsh.

==Riots==
The town is known for its three major riots. In 1868 there were the election riots, which took place after the locals&#x27; favourite candidate, Colonel Clifford, was not elected.

Secondly in 1882 there was a major anti-Irish riot in Tredegar. There had been a large Irish community in Tredegar since the 1850s, and for a while there had been tensions. Reports from the time vary, however where they all concur includes the fact the riot began with stone throwing and quickly escalated with Irishmen&#x27;s homes being destroyed and furniture burned in the streets. The Irish were run out of Tredegar and some were beaten. Troops from Newport and Cardiff had to be called in to quell the violence

Thirdly, there were the anti-Jewish riots of 1911, which some called a pogrom, when Jewish shops were ransacked and the army had to be brought in. Though Jewish businesses and property were attacked, nobody was killed in this riot.

==Foundation==
Samuel Homfray and his partners needed accommodation for their workers, and so needed to develop a suitable town. The land on the eastside of the Sirhowy river was owned by Lt.Col. Sir Charles Gould Morgan who granted a lease in 1799 to build Tredegar Ironworks Company. In 1800, Homfray married Sir Charles daughter Jane, and hence improved his lease terms. The west bank of the river was owned by Lord Tredegar, and hence in the short term remained undeveloped.

Homfray was a hard task master. He sold franchises to business people who wanted to operate within his town, from which he would take a percentage. He paid his workers in his own private coinage, so that they could not easily spend their wages outside the town. However, the opportunity to work created a boom town, which with a parish population of 1,132 in 1801 had boomed to 34,685 by 1881, in part boosted by the laying of the stretch of horse drawn track to Newport in 1805.

But all of this development came at a price. Adrian Vaughn, in his 1985 book &quot;Grub, Water &amp; Relief&quot;, mentions that in 1832 John Gooch took a managerial post in the Tredegar iron works:
There were several cholera epidemics in the town in the 19th century, and a dedicated cholera burial ground was established at Cefn Golau.

==Governance==
===Links with the Labour Party===
Tredegar has strong links with prominent Labour MPs and the history of the Labour Party and the Labour Movement in Britain as a whole. It was the birthplace of Aneurin Bevan, who was responsible for the introduction of the British National Health Service (NHS), and who in the 1920s was involved in the management of Tredegar General Hospital. Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992, was born in Tredegar in 1942 and lived there for most of his early life, attending the town&#x27;s Georgetown Infants and Junior Schools between 1947 and 1953. His predecessor as leader, Michael Foot, was Labour MP for the local constituency — Ebbw Vale — during his time as party leader. As part of the once safe Labour constituency of Blaenau Gwent, Tredegar was for a period represented by the independent left-wing politician Dai Davies until the general election of 2010, when it reverted to Labour.

==Architecture==
===Bedwellty House===
Bedwellty House is a Grade II listed house and gardens. Originally a &quot;low thatched-roof cottage&quot;, the old house was renovated in 1809. The present Bedwellty House was built in 1818 as a home for Samuel Homfray, whose Iron and Coal Works were the main local employers for much of the 19th century. The surrounding Victorian garden and park, designed originally as a Dutch garden around which one could walk or ride without being confronted by gate, fence or outside features, contains the Long Shelter, also a Grade II listed structure built for the Chartist Movement.

===Town Clock===
One of Tredegar&#x27;s main attributes is the Town Clock, dominating the southern part of the town centre. The clock was made by JB Joyce &amp; Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire and was the idea of Mrs. R. P. Davies, the wife of the Tredegar Ironworks manager, who had decided that she wanted to present a &quot;lofty illuminated clock&quot;, and it was she who decided that it would be erected in the Circle.

&quot;The clock tower is seventy-two feet high. The foundation is of masonry, on which is surmounted the cast-iron base which has four arms from each corner to a distance of sixty feet at a depth of five feet and six inches (152 mm) below ground level. The pillar is wholly composed of cast-iron, upon a square pediment which in turn, receives a rectangular plinth, and upon this stands a cylindrical column of smooth surface and symmetrical diameter, ornamented with suitable coping on which rests the clock surrounded with a weather vane. The plinth is inscribed on the four aspects, on the south side - Presented to the town of Tredegar from the proceeds of a bazaar promoted by Mrs. R.P. Davis. Erected in the year 1858. On the west side is effigy of Wellington, with the legend - Wellington, England&#x27;s Hero. On the North, the Royal Arms of England; and on the east, the name and description of the founder with his crest, - Charles Jordan, Iron Founder, Newport, Mon. The clock is provided with four transparent faces or dials, each five feet three inches diameter, and these were illuminated originally by gas, but this was later changed to electricity. The minute hands are each two feet two inches long, and the hour hand one foot seven inches long. The clocks mechanism is a fifteen inch (381 mm) mainwheel strike, with a single four-legged Gravity Escapement driving the four dials. It has a 1¼ second pendulum and the bob weighs two hundredweight&quot;.

==Climate==
==Culture and leisure==
The Tredegar Town Band, which takes part in national competitions, was founded in 1849.

Tredegar Orpheus Male voice choir, which takes its name from Orpheus, the Greek god of music, was founded in 1909.

Tredegar is home to rugby union teams Tredegar Rugby Football Club who play in the Swalec League Division Two East and Tredegar Ironsides Rugby Football Club. The club was formed in 1946. There is also the nearby Tredegar and Rhymney Golf Club.

Tredegar is home to Bryn Bach Park, a country park.

Home of the Blaenau Gwent film Academy which gives young people (7-18) opportunity to learn how to produce films and build up confidence, which has gone to produce both multi award-winning films Life of a Plastic Cup and Stationary Bike based on the short story by Stephen King.

==Transport==
The need for transport development came from Tredegar&#x27;s industrialisation. By 1805, a joint venture between the Tredegar Iron Company and the Monmouthshire Canal resulted in the early development of what became the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway, connecting Tredegar to Newport Docks through of tramway. Originally powered by horses, in 1829 Chief Engineer Thomas Ellis was authorised to purchase a steam locomotive from the Stephenson Company. Built at Tredegar Works and made its maiden trip on 17 December 1829. In 1865 the railway was extended north to Nantybwch to meet the LNWR. The railway declined with the industrial works, and Tredegar railway station closed with the Beeching Axe in 1963. The closest railway stations now are in Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Abergavenny.

The proposed South Wales Metro includes a station in Tredegar, using the line closed by British Railways as part of their Beeching modernisation plan.

For much of the 20th Century Tredegar was served by two bus companies: Red &amp; White Services Ltd (based in Chepstow) and Hill&#x27;s of Tredegar (a local family-owned business). Red &amp; White can trace their services in the town back to 13 June 1921, when John Watts &amp; partner started the Valleys Motor Bus Services running two routes from Tredegar. Their operation expanded and by 1930 had become Red &amp; White Services. The company had a large depot in the town and built a brand new Bus Station (in front of the depot building) which was opened 30 January 1959 by then local MP Aneurin Bevan.

==Carreg Bica Isaf==
In October 2013, a local farmer was jailed for ten months after he permitted 4,700 loads of waste to be illegally dumped on his land, earning £283,000. A spokesmen for Natural Resources Wales hoped the case would show that people could not profit from illegal dumping.

==Filming location==
Tredegar has been used for numerous TV and film locations, including &quot;The District Nurse&quot; starring Nerys Hughes. In 1982, a televised version of the A.J. Cronin novel, &quot;The Citadel&quot;, was filmed in Tredegar, starring Ben Cross. The series was based partly on Cronin&#x27;s experiences as a doctor in the town, where he had worked for the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in the early 1920s. This society contributed the model which established the British National Health Service. Aneurin Bevan who launched the Health Service in 1948 said &quot;&quot;All I am doing is extending to the entire population of Britain the benefits we had in Tredegar for a generation or more. We are going to &#x27;Tredegarise&#x27; you&quot;

Just north of Tredegar lies the Trefil region. Trefil found new fame in 2005 when it was used as a location for the alien Vogon homeworld in the film of Douglas Adams&#x27;s book &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2011 the Trefil Region was once again used as a filming location for a major Hollywood production when parts of a sequel to &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; was filmed there.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe, Trefil has featured as the Ood home planet and in The Sarah Jane Adventures.

On 13 May 2008 the car crash scene for short film &quot;Cow&quot; was filmed on the Tredegar bypass. &#x27;Cow&#x27; was produced by Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School to highlight the dangers of texting while driving. The movie was made available online and received widespread attention, featuring on TV news programs, in newspapers and internet forums worldwide.

On 25 January 2010 the independent movie A Bit of Tom Jones? premiered at Leicester Square, London. Filmed in and around Tredegar, using local people and professional actors, the film was funded by local businesses.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode The Hungry Earth was filmed in Bedwellty Pits in 2010.

In 2018 the news of Blaenau Gwent film Academy (based in Tredegar&#x27;s Little Theatre) was set to adapt the Stephen King&#x27;s short story &#x27;Stationary Bike&#x27; spread literally around the world, all of which would be filmed in Tredegar and the nearby Trefil region
