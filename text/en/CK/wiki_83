<text>David Corn (born February 20, 1959) is an American political journalist and author. He is the Washington, D.C. bureau chief for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and is best known as a cable television commentator. Corn worked at &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1987 to 2007, where he served as Washington editor.

==Early life and education==
Corn was raised in a Jewish family in White Plains, New York. He graduated from White Plains High School in 1977. He attended Brown University, where he majored in history and worked for &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot;. After his junior year, he interned at &quot;The Nation&quot; where he accepted a job as editorial assistant instead of returning to finish his degree. He earned his remaining credits at Columbia University and received a B.A. from Brown in 1982.
==Career==
He was the Washington editor for &quot;The Nation&quot; and has appeared regularly on FOX News, MSNBC, National Public Radio, and BloggingHeads.tv. He joined &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 2007. Corn appeared on FOX News more than sixty times, according to a tally by &quot;Politifact.com&quot;, before becoming a commentator on MSNBC.

In February 2013, Corn was given the 2012 George Polk Award in journalism in the category of political reporting for his posting of a video and reporting of the &quot;47 percent story&quot;, Republican nominee Mitt Romney&#x27;s videoed meeting with donors during the 2012 presidential campaign.

===Books===
Corn&#x27;s first book was &quot;Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA&#x27;s Crusades&quot;, a 1994 biography of longtime Central Intelligence Agency official Theodore Shackley, which received mixed reviews. The book used Shackley&#x27;s climb through the CIA bureaucracy to illustrate how the Agency worked and to follow some of its Cold War-era covert operations. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Roger Warner called it &quot;an impressive feat of research&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, Joseph Finder asserted that Corn seriously distorted history to blame Shackley for a series of institutional CIA failings and pointed out a series of serious errors in the book. Among them, Finder said, was that Corn &quot;recycled a long-discredited canard, much beloved by conspiracy theorists, that on the day of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, the agency&#x27;s chief of covert operations, Desmond Fitzgerald, met in Paris with one of the C.I.A.&#x27;s Cuban agents and gave him a &#x27;ball-point pen&#x27; that could be used to inject Castro with a deadly toxin called Black Leaf 40. FitzGerald was actually the host of a lunch in Washington at the time, at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown.&quot;

Corn contributed a short story to &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot; (1996), a paperback collection of original crime stories. The story was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award. 

His novel, &quot;Deep Background&quot; (1999), is a conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a U.S. president at a White House press conference and the ensuing investigation. Reviews praised Corn&#x27;s mastery of the political atmosphere and characters, although they split on whether this was a virtue or, coming towards the conclusion of Bill Clinton&#x27;s term in office, already all-too-familiar territory. Reviewing the book in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, James Polk opined that although the book included dramatic scenes such as a &quot;seedy nightspot catering to homosexual marines, an interagency hit squad, a high-class &quot;look, but don&#x27;t touch&quot; escort service&quot;, the novel could not deliver &quot;enough shocks left to sustain the genre&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot;, though, called it a &quot;top-notch conspiracy thriller,&quot; with reviewer Les Whitten observing, &quot;This pot-au-feu of a thriller is brimming with gusto in spite of its familiar ingredients: Watergate, Chappaquiddick, the Kennedy assassinations, CIA scandals, congressional corruption and White House aide angst. Every old carrot and potato has been warmed over. Yet when you finish it, the palate wants more. How can this be? Maybe it tastes so good because it&#x27;s deepened with subtle tangs of Dante, the Apostle John, Robert Penn Warren and some heartbreaker &#x27;60s ballads.&quot; 

Corn was a critic of Clinton&#x27;s successor, President George W. Bush. Corn&#x27;s next book, 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception&quot;, said that Bush had systematically &quot;mugged the truth&quot; as a political strategy, and he found fault with the media for failing to report this effectively. The book also broke with journalistic practice for its charge of lying, a word usually avoided as editorializing. In particular, Corn criticized many of the arguments offered to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and he challenged &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist William Safire for claiming links between Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda. In &quot;Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War&quot;, co-written by Michael Isikoff of &quot;Newsweek&quot; and Corn, they analyzed the Bush administration&#x27;s drive toward the invasion.

Corn with journalist Michael Isikoff co-wrote a book about the Donald Trump campaign and administration&#x27;s ties with Russia and Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential campaign, including a history of similar Russian tactics during earlier administrations. Their book, &quot;Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin&#x27;s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump&quot;, was released by Twelve in March 2018.

===The Plame affair===

Corn was personally involved in the early coverage of the controversy over leaks to the media of the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame. After Robert Novak revealed Plame&#x27;s identity in his July 14, 2003, column, Corn was among the first to report, several days later, that Plame had been working covertly. He also raised the possibility that the leak of her identity violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (IIPA); however, prosecutors found no evidence that those government officials who leaked her name knew she was a covert agent, and no official was ultimately charged with violating the IIPA.

Novak, for his part, disputed that Plame had been a covert operative at the time her identity was revealed. He also objected to the negative portrayal of himself in &quot;Hubris&quot;, the book in part about the matter by Corn and Isikoff. Novak said of Corn, &quot;Nobody was more responsible for bloating this episode&quot;. Novak felt that Corn was too close with former ambassador Joseph Wilson, Plame&#x27;s husband and a key figure in criticism of the administration&#x27;s arguments for invasion. However, in early 2007, an unclassified summary of Valerie Plame&#x27;s employment history at the CIA was disclosed for the first time in a court filing which confirmed that Plame was indeed a covert operative at the time Novak made her name public.

===Mitt Romney &quot;47 Percent&quot; video and George Polk Award===
In announcing Corn&#x27;s being awarded the George Polk Award for 2012, the sponsors wrote:David Corn of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; will receive the George Polk Award for Political Reporting ... Through persistent digging and careful negotiation with a source, Corn secured a full recording of Romney at a $50,000-a-plate Florida fundraiser declaring that 47 percent of Americans — those who back President Obama — are &quot;victims&quot; who are &quot;dependent upon government&quot; and &quot;pay no income tax&quot;. Corn worked for weeks to obtain the recording ... Furthermore, it was Corn&#x27;s extensive previous reporting on Romney that convinced the source to trust him with its release. Corn&#x27;s article that introduced the secret tape was published online on the &quot;Mother Jones&quot; on September 17, 2012.

<doc id="1143767" wikidata="Q911798" url="?curid=1143767" title="Kaikōura Peninsula">
<text>The Kaikōura Peninsula is located in the northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It protrudes into the Pacific Ocean. The town of Kaikōura is located on the north shore of the peninsula. The peninsula has been settled by Māori for approximately 1000 years, and by Europeans since the 1800s, when whaling operations began off the Kaikōura Coast. Since the end of whaling in 1922 whales have been allowed to thrive and the region is now a popular whale watching destination.

The Kaikōura Peninsula is made up of limestone and mudstone which have been deposited, uplifted and deformed throughout the Quaternary. The peninsula is situated in a tectonically active region bounded by the Marlborough Fault System.
==History==

Māori oral history and tradition describes the demi-god ancestor Māui standing on Kaikōura Peninsula where he &quot;fished up&quot; or discovered the North Island. An old name for the South Island is &quot;Te Waka a Māui&quot; (the canoe of Māui), and the name of the North Island is &quot;Te Ika a Māui&quot; (the fish of Māui). The peninsula has been inhabited by Māori for the best part of 1000 years. They used it as a base for hunting moa, and also harvested the plentiful crayfish which are found along the shore. Strategic positions on the high terraces were fortified and those fortifications can still be seen in lidar imagery of the peninsula

During the 19th century, European whaling stations were established in the area. In more recent times, the whales that visit the coast off the peninsula have been allowed to thrive, and whale-watching makes the area a popular ecotourism destination. Whales frequent these coastal waters because squid and other deep-sea creatures are brought from the deep Hikurangi Trough to the surface by the combination currents and steeply sloping seafloor.

== Geology and geomorphology ==

The Kaikōura Peninsula is located on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Geologically the peninsula consists of an asymmetrical anticline bounded on either side by two synclines, the axis of which strikes northeast–southwest. The peninsula is made up of two different types of sedimentary rocks, the Amuri Limestone of Palaeocene age and Oligocene aged mudstone. Intense folding and minor faulting have occurred, particularly in the limestone area. Shore platforms are developed in both lithological units, those in limestone displaying wider variability in morphology. The multi-level terraces were once wave-cut platforms, created at sea level and uplifted out of the sea by tectonic processes, at which point the next step would be cut. In the landscape they appear as a flight of terraces with the oldest appearing at the top and the youngest at the shoreline where the Kaikōura township is situated.

The shoreline of the Kaikōura Peninsula is exposed to an extremely long fetch from the Pacific Ocean, and it is also characterised as a high-energy oceanic swell environment, with high-energy storms interrupting long periods of relative calm. High-energy storms due to the passage of cyclonic depressions over New Zealand can occur at any time of the year. The Kaikōura Coast has a mean tidal range of 1.36 m and a maximum of 2.57 m. The region has a temperate climate with moderate rainfall, averaging 865 mm per year and mean monthly temperatures range from 7.7 °C in July to 16.2 °C in January.

The Kaikōura Peninsula environment is subject to highly energetic processes in terms of both marine and weathering processes. Shore platforms are exposed to the dominant wave directions and are in the intertidal zone. Consequently, both marine erosive forces and subaerial weathering processes contribute to erosion. Shore platforms range from 40 m to over 200 m wide and are cut in Tertiary mudstones and limestones.

Tectonic uplift of the central parts of the peninsula is estimated to be in the order of 100 metres during the Quaternary but the terraces are tilting and so surface uplift is variable. Flights of beaches that fringe the Peninsula record a combination of uplift by earthquakes and sea level fall. The most recent uplift occurred during the Kaikōura Earthquake of 14 November 2016 and another probably occurred shortly before the arrival of whalers in the area around 1840. The shore platforms are polycyclic and contain inherent morphological features but are being actively rejuvenated by the removal of cover deposits.

Four main phases of tectonic activity are identified for the last 5–6000 years. These involve changing tectonic-eustatic levels, platform processes and erosional episodes in the hinterland. Consequently, the platforms are rapidly evolving features which reflect both contemporary processes and recent tectonic history.

<doc id="1143768" wikidata="Q5380369" url="?curid=1143768" title="Enterprise bargaining agreement">
<text>Enterprise bargaining is an Australian term for a form of collective bargaining, in which wages and working conditions are negotiated at the level of the individual organisations, as distinct from sectoral collective bargaining across whole industries. Once established, they are legally binding on employers and employees that are covered by the Enterprise bargaining agreement. An Enterprise Agreement (EA) consists of a collective industrial agreement between either an employer and a trade union acting on behalf of employees or an employer and employees acting for themselves.

By definition, an agreement, is the outcome of a &quot;negotiation&quot;, and a &quot;decision&quot;, involving multiple &quot;parties&quot;. (See Fair trade)

On the one hand, collective agreements, at least in principle, benefit employers, as they allow for improved &quot;flexibility&quot; in such areas as ordinary hours, flat rates of hourly pay, and performance-related conditions. Whilst collective agreements may, on the other hand, benefit some workers by providing higher pay, bonuses, additional leave and enhanced entitlements (such as redundancy pay) than an award does, they also may reduce employees&#x27; bargaining power against their employers, impacting their ability to successfully obtain such benefits. In other words, whilst those employees who are successful in negotiating an Enterprise Agreement may receive greater benefits than those who are not, the overall number of employees earning comparatively high benefits may be reduced because few employees obtain an Enterprise Agreement.

==Industrial Awards and the Fair Work Act==
Unlike awards, which provide similar standards for all workers in the entire industry covered by a specific award, collective agreements usually apply only to workers for one employer. However, a short-term collaborative agreement (for example, on a building-site) occasionally yields a multi-employer/employee agreement.

Parties endorse proposed enterprise agreements between themselves (in the case of employees the matter goes to a vote). The Fair Work Commission then assess them for approval. (Under the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;, agreements renamed &quot;enterprise agreements&quot; and are lodged with the Fair Work Commission to assess entitlements against the modern award and be checked for breaches of the Act.)

===History===

Enterprise Bargaining Agreements were first introduced in Australia under the Prices and Incomes Accord in 1991 (Mark VII). They later became the centrepiece of the Australian industrial relations system when the Accord was next revised in 1993 (Mark VIII). This ended nearly a century of centralised wage-fixing based industrial relations.

===How an enterprise agreement is made===
The Fair Work Act 2009 provides a simple, flexible and fair framework that assists employers and employees to bargain in good faith to make an enterprise agreement.

Employers, employees and their bargaining representatives are involved in the process of bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. An employer must notify their employees of the right to be represented by a bargaining representative during the bargaining of an enterprise agreement (other than a greenfields agreement) as soon as possible, and not later than 14 days after the notification time for the agreement (usually the start of bargaining). The notification should be given to each current employee who will be covered by the enterprise agreement.

===Use of enterprise agreements===

A standard enterprise agreement would last for three years.

EAs had one unique feature in Australia: whilst negotiating a federal enterprise bargaining agreement, a group of employees or a trade union could, without legal penalties, undertake industrial action (including strikes) in pursuit of their claims .

===Issues regarding enterprise agreements===
A major legal question associated with enterprise agreements stemmed from the High Court of Australia&#x27;s decision in the case of &quot;Electrolux v The Australian Workers&#x27; Union&quot;. The question revolved around what these industrial instruments could cover. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission determined the matter in 2005 in the three certified agreements case.

=== The future of EAs in Australian industrial law ===
In the context of Australian labour law, the industrial reform of 2005–2006, known as &quot;WorkChoices&quot; (with its corresponding amendments to the Workplace Relations Act (1996)) changed the name of such agreement documents to &quot;Collective Agreement&quot;. State industrial legislation can also prescribe collective agreements, but the enactment of the WorkChoices reform will make such agreements less likely to occur.

Since the Fair Work Act was enacted, parties to Australian federal collective agreements lodge their agreements with Fair Work Australia for approval. Before an enterprise agreement will be approved a member of the tribunal must be satisfied that employees employed under the agreement will be &#x27;Better Off Overall&#x27; than if they were employed under the relevant modern award.

<text>Gerhard Schrader (25 February 1903 – 10 April 1990) was a German chemist specializing in the discovery of new insecticides, hoping to make progress in the fight against hunger in the world. Schrader is best known for his accidental discovery of nerve agents including sarin and tabun. Sarin is partially named after him: It was named in honor of its discoverers, Schrader, Otto Ambros, , and Hans-Jürgen von der Linde.

Schrader was born in Bortfeld, near Wendeburg, Germany. He attended gymnasium in Braunschweig and later studied chemistry at Braunschweig University of Technology. He was later employed at the Bayer AG division of IG Farben.

Schrader discovered several very effective insecticides, including bladan (the first fully synthetic contact insecticide, Hexaethyl tetraphosphate being a constituent), and parathion (E 605). In 1936, while employed by the large German conglomerate IG Farben, he was experimenting with a class of compounds called organophosphates, which killed insects by interrupting their nervous systems. 

Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the synthesis of Tabun. During World War II, under the Nazi regime, teams led by Schrader discovered two more organophosphate nerve agents, and a fourth after the war:

* Tabun (1936)
* Sarin (1938)
* Soman (1944)
* Cyclosarin (1949)

<text>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is a state agency that supports research and education in the fields of stem cell and gene therapies. It was created in 2004 after 59% of California voters approved California Proposition 71: the Research and Cures Initiative, which allocated $3 billion to fund stem cell research in California. In 2020 voters approved Proposition 14 that allocated additional funds to CIRM.

CIRM supports research and training at many stem cell institutes throughout California, including Sanford Consortium, University of California, Santa Cruz, Stanford University, University of California Davis, University of California Irvine, University of California San Francisco, University of California Los Angeles and University of Southern California. In addition, it has supported the establishment of nine &quot;Alpha Stem Cell Clinics&quot; that lead clinical trials for stem cell therapies at City of Hope, University of California San Diego, University of California San Francisco, University of California Davis, a joint clinic at University of California Los Angeles and University of California Irvine, Cedars Sinai, Stanford, and USC/Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.

==History==
CIRM was established via California Proposition 71 (2004). However, its implementation was delayed when out-of-state based opponents incorporated in California to file two lawsuits that challenged the proposition&#x27;s constitutionality. Opponents argued that the initiative created a taxpayer-funded entity not under state control, that the Independent Citizen&#x27;s Oversight Committee (ICOC) had a conflict of interest with representatives being eligible for grant money, and that the initiative violated the single-subject requirement of initiatives by funding areas beyond stem cell research. In May 2007, the Supreme Court of California declined to review the two lower court decisions, thereby upholding Proposition 71 as constitutional and permitting CIRM to fund stem cell research in California.

Examples of CIRM funding include:

* In 2018, UC San Francisco (UCSF) received a $12 million grant to study severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The research UCSF was able to conduct due to the funding the institution received contributed in part to a potential cure in 2019, described in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine: Lentiviral Gene Therapy Combined with Low-Dose Busulfan in Infants with SCID-X1.
* In 2017, CIRM awarded $2 million to a University of California San Diego scientist searching for a cure for the Zika infection. Research resulted successfully finding a pre-approved drug to block Zika virus replication and infection, as well as transmission from mother to child.
* In 2011, CIRM awarded $25 million to support a spinal cord injury trial – the first award dedicated to a human clinical trial – to Geron Corporation, which was later taken up by Asterias Biotherapeutics. The clinical trial led to significant benefits to a paralyzed high school student, Jake Javier, who was able to regain function in his upper body.

In late 2019, CIRM had awarded more than $2.67 billion in grant funding across six broad categories: physical and institutional infrastructure, basic research, education and training, research translation, research application and clinical trials.

The $3 billion initially provided to CIRM through Proposition 71 was budgeted to last until 2017. In February 2014, Robert Klein, a leader in the initial campaign for Proposition 71 and former CIRM Board Chair, presented a proposal at the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center to extend CIRM funding. Another option discussed at that time, was for CIRM to become a private, non-profit organization that would rely solely on outside funding.

In 2020, as CIRM&#x27;s funding from the 2004 Proposition 71 was expiring, another ballot measure, Proposition 14, was advanced in California to add an additional $5.5 billion to CIRM, to enable it to continue its mission. The measure passed with 51% of the vote, and so the CIRM will continue operating.

==Oversight==
The CIRM Board is composed of members appointed by elected state officers, including the Governor, Lt. Governor, the State Treasurer, The Controller, the Speaker of the CA State Assembly and the President Pro Tempore of the California State Senate. Only one member shall be appointed from a single university, institution or entity.

The most recent 2018 audit found CIRM has a collaborative, engaged and performance-oriented culture, is patient-centered and has improved processes to be more efficient and effective since the implementation of CIRM 2.0.

In 2008 the Little Hoover Commission evaluated CIRM at the request of California Senators Sheila Kuehl and George Runner. The Commission commented specifically on the structure of the CIRM governance board and the need for greater transparency and accountability. The Commission provided suggestions on how to improve the structure and enhance the functioning of the CIRM board some of which included: decreasing the size of the ICOC from 29 to 15 members with four having no affiliations with CIRM-funded organizations; allowing board members to serve a maximum of four years; and eliminating the overlapping responsibilities of the agency chair and the board president. In addition, the Commission recommended that CIRM also allow outside experts to evaluate grant proposals.

CA Senator Dean Florez, Little Hoover Commission member and State Senate Majority leader at the time, was not satisfied with the report, highlighting several concerns in a letter to the Little Hoover Commission, stating: “I am concerned about the Commission&#x27;s apparent rush to conclude its report. As one member said at the meeting, five minutes and a sandwich is not adequate time for Commission members to absorb the information that was presented. While I appreciate the substantial effort that Commission members and staff put into drafting the report, I am concerned that due to its rush to approve the report, the Commission gave disproportionate weight to CIRM&#x27;s critics and did not consider a broader range of views on the complex issues that are the subject of the report.”

A 2008 “Review Of Conflict-Of-Interest Policies, Grant Administration, Administrative Expenses, And Expenditures,” by the State Controller’s office, which examined 18 straight months of the agency’s operations, found that “CIRM has extensive conflict-of-interest policies and processes that are modeled after and, in some instances, go beyond National Institute of Health requirements. Our conclusion is consistent with the Bureau of State Audits in its audit report of CIRM issued in February 2007.”

In December 2012, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report, “The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine: Science, Governance, and the Pursuit of Cures”, that evaluated CIRM programs and operations since its start in 2004. The IOM committee made recommendations similar to those made in the Little Hoover Commission. In general, the IOM recommended that the ICOC separate their responsibilities as executor and overseer and noted potential conflicts of interest among the CIRM board members. Several active CIRM board members also represented organizations that currently received or benefited from CIRM grants. The IOM committee also recommended that CIRM organize a single Scientific Advisory Board with experts in stem cell biology and cell-based therapies.

In 2014 the integrity of CIRM&#x27;s grant review process was challenged, after CIRM awarded a Stanford-led consortium $40 million stem cell genomics award, making it the largest CIRM research grant. In February 2013, CIRM reviewers evaluated applications for genomics awards but, for the first time, declined to send any grant proposals to the board for a final decision. Comments were sent back to the researchers and re-submissions were accepted in Fall 2013. During the Fall 2013 review, CIRM reviewers sent all four genomic award proposals to the CIRM board, recommending that all four projects receive funding despite the projects exceeding the budget of $40 million. The CIRM President, Alan Trounson, became involved in the selection process and the final decision was to fund the Stanford project only, totaling $40 million. The CIRM grant review and scoring process and the role of President Trounson have been questioned, especially by those that did not receive funding like Jeanne Loring from the stem cell program at Scripps Research Institute.

<doc id="1143777" wikidata="Q7148371" url="?curid=1143777" title="Pattern bargaining">
<text>Pattern bargaining is a process in labour relations, where a trade union gains a new and superior entitlement from one employer and then uses that agreement as a precedent to demand the same entitlement or a superior one from other employers.

In the United States, pattern bargaining was pioneered by unions such as the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters. The first step of the bargaining process is the identification of a target employer that is most likely to agree to a favourable employment contract. For the selected company, this provides an opportunity to influence the contract for the industry, while the downside is the risk of a labour disruption if negotiations stall or fail. Once this contract has been successfully negotiated and ratified by the unionized workers, the union declares it a &quot;pattern agreement&quot; and presents it to the other employers as a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

In Australia, pattern bargaining was specifically outlawed under the now-repealed WorkChoices legislation. The law was repealed by the Labor Party after their victory in the 2007 election, but Labor&#x27;s Fair Work Act, which came into force on 1 July 2010, still outlaws pattern bargaining.

<text>Sebring International Raceway is a road course auto racing facility in the southeastern United States, located near Sebring, Florida.

Sebring Raceway is one of the oldest continuously operating race tracks in the U.S., its first race being run in 1950. Sebring is one of the classic race tracks in North American sports car racing, and plays host to the 12 Hours of Sebring.

The raceway occupies a portion of Sebring Regional Airport (an active airport for private and commercial traffic that was originally built as Hendricks Army Airfield, which was a World War II training base for the United States Army Air Forces).

==History==

Sebring Raceway occupies the site of Hendricks Army Airfield (a training base for B-17 pilots in operation from 1941 to 1946), in the middle of southern Florida, south and southeast respectively of Orlando and Tampa, and northwest of Miami. After the war, Russian-American aeronautical engineer Alec Ulmann was seeking sites for converting military aircraft to civilian use when he discovered potential in Hendricks&#x27; runways and service roads to stage a sports car endurance race similar to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a race Ulmann was inspired to somewhat re-create in the United States. Sebring&#x27;s first race was held on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1950, attracting thirty race cars from across North America. The Sam Collier 6 Hour Memorial race was won by Frits Koster and Ralph Deshon in a Crosley Hot Shot that had been driven to the track by Victor Sharpe.

The first 12 Hours of Sebring was held on March 15, 1952, shortly growing into a major international race. In 1959, the track hosted the U.S.&#x27; first Formula One race (the successor to historic European Grand Prix motor racing), held as that year&#x27;s instalment of the historic United States Grand Prix competition (although the Indianapolis 500 was an official part of the Formula One World Championship from 1950 to 1960, the 500 was never considered a true Grand Prix by the European and British based teams who largely ignored it at the time). However poor attendance and high costs relocated the next U.S. Grand Prix to Riverside International Raceway in southern California.
For much of Sebring&#x27;s history, the track followed a layout. After a disastrous 1966 12 Hours with five fatalities, the track was widened in parts and also lengthened a total of for 1967 with the removal of the Webster Turn between the hairpin and the top of the track and replacement with the faster Green Park Chicane, further down the track. This was closer to the hairpin and allowed a flat-out run through a very fast corner to the top of the track and the runway. This was done to move the track off the dangerous Warehouse Straight and the warehouses, hangars and airplanes flanking it; a crash during that 1966 12 Hours involved a privately-entered Porsche that went into one of the warehouses (this area was off-limits to non-track personnel) and into a crowd, killing four spectators.

The circuit was changed and shortened in 1983 to allow simultaneous use of the track and one of the runways, and major changes in 1987 allowed use of another runway. Further changes in 1991 accommodated expansion of the airport&#x27;s facilities, allowing the entire track to be used without interfering with normal airport operations and bringing it close to its current configuration. The hairpin was removed in 1997 due to a lack of run-off, and replaced with what became known as the &quot;safety pin&quot;. Gendebien Bend was also re-profiled to slow the cars&#x27; entry to the Ullman straight.
The track is currently owned by IMSA Holdings, LLC through its subsidiary Sebring International Raceway, LLC via its purchase of the Panoz MSG in September 2012. It is currently leased by the Sebring International Raceway, LLC, which acquired the facility from Andy Evans in 1997.

The track is often recognized for its famous, high-speed &quot;Turn 17&quot;, a long, bumpy, fast right-hander that can make or break a car&#x27;s speed down the front straight. The corner can fit up to three cars wide.

Skip Barber Racing School held numerous programs at the facility, including a scholarship opportunity for young racers.

From 2019 to 2023 (with no races run in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the World Endurance Championship ran a round called the 1000 Miles of Sebring, run concurrently with the famed 12 Hours. The first race in 2019 was won by Toyota Gazoo Racing. When the event returned after the pandemic in 2022 it was won by the French Alpine Elf Team. Toyota then won their second race at Sebring in 2023. The FIA dropped the race from the WEC calendar in 2024 and 2025, its place being taken by the Lone Star Le Mans race at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas..

On October 30, 2021, the first-ever 24-hour race at Sebring took place, hosted by the World Racing League, an amateur endurance championship series, with W2W Racing winning the overall race by four laps on the field in their #983 Porsche Motorsports type 981 Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR.

==Track configuration==

Sebring International Raceway consists of three tracks: the Full Circuit, the Short Circuit, and the Club Circuit. The course of the track itself is long. It is a seventeen-turn road course with long straights, several high-speed corners, and very technical slower corners. Many of the turns and points along the track are named for the early teams and drivers. Due to Florida&#x27;s flat nature there is very little elevation change around the track and little camber on the surface, providing a challenging track for drivers, especially when it rains.

Sebring is renowned for its rough, bumpy and changing surfaces. The course still runs on old sections of World War II-era landing fields that were constructed of concrete sections with large seams. The transitions between sections are quite rough and often, sparks fly from the undercarriages of the cars as they traverse them. Much of the track has intentionally been left with its original concrete runway surface. The 12 Hours of Sebring is renowned as a race that is even harder on machinery and drivers than Le Mans, and is seen as an ideal preparation run for the famed French race.

The track surface has of asphalt and of concrete. Mario Andretti, a 3-time 12 Hours winner, said that one of the hardest parts about the original Sebring track was &quot;finding the track to begin with.&quot; There had been many accounts of drivers retiring due to accidents at night, quite simply because they got lost on the runway sections and couldn&#x27;t find the track again. Some drivers got lost even during the day, mostly because the track was poorly marked down with white lines and cones.

==Events==

Sebring is most notable for hosting the 12 Hours of Sebring, sanctioned by the FIA and IMSA, as part of many major endurance racing series, including the World Sportscar Championship, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, ALMS, and now, the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. This race is the second of four races in the Michelin Endurance Cup. It has also hosted the final round of the 24H Series in 2021.

The track also hosts the Legends of Motorsport and Historic Sportscar Racing series, and is the winter home of the Skip Barber Racing School. Many IndyCar, sports prototype, and Grand Touring teams use Sebring for winter testing due to the warm climate.

The track is used numerous times each year by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and the National Auto Sport Association (NASA) for amateur events that draw participants from all over the country.

IndyCar regularly holds tests at the top half of the facility to simulate street circuits on its calendar.

<text>The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) is Florida&#x27;s official state-sponsored and chartered natural history museum. Its main facilities are located at 3215 Hull Road on the campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville.

The main public exhibit facility, Powell Hall and the attached McGuire Center, is located in the Cultural Plaza, which it shares with the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art and the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. The main research facility and former public exhibits building, Dickinson Hall, is located on the east side of campus at the corner of Museum Road and Newell Drive. On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects&#x27;s Florida chapter placed Dickinson Hall on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as the Florida Museum of Natural History / Formerly Florida Museum of Natural Sciences.

Powell Hall&#x27;s permanent public exhibits focus on the flora, fauna, fossils, and historic peoples of the state of Florida. The museum does not charge for admission to most exhibits; the exceptions are the Butterfly Rainforest and certain traveling exhibits.

The museum&#x27;s collections were first used for teaching at Florida Agriculture College in Lake City in the 1800s, and were relocated to the campus of the University of Florida in 1906. The museum was chartered as the state&#x27;s official natural history museum by the Florida Legislature in 1917. Formerly known as the Florida State Museum, the name was changed in 1988 to more accurately reflect the museum&#x27;s mission and help avoid confusion with Florida State University, which is located in Tallahassee.

== Research ==
The Florida Museum of Natural History received $8 million in annual research revenue in 2024.

== History ==

=== Enabling legislation ===

The role of the Florida Museum of Natural History as the official natural history museum for Florida, according to Florida Statute §1004.56, is &quot;to make scientific investigations toward the sustained development of natural resources and a greater appreciation of human cultural heritage&quot;.

== Current facilities ==
In the over 100 years of operation, the Florida Museum of Natural History has been housed in several buildings, from the Seagle Building in downtown Gainesville, to the three halls on campus and one off-site research facility.

=== Dickinson Hall ===

Dickinson Hall, opened in 1971, is located on Museum Road. It currently houses over 25 million objects and artifacts in its collections, which include ichthyology, paleontology (both vertebrate and invertebrate), botany, paleobotany and palynology, herpetology, malacology, mammalogy, ornithology, environmental archaeology, historical archaeology, archeology of the Caribbean and Florida, and the ethnography of Latin and North Americas. It also houses a state-of-the-art Molecular Systematics and Evolutionary Genetics lab.

=== Powell Hall ===
Located in the University of Florida Cultural Plaza, Powell Hall was constructed in 1995. It serves, along with the connected McGuire Center, as the main exhibits and public programs facility. Powell Hall was partially funded from a gift of $3 million from two University of Florida alumni couples; Bob and Ann and Steve and Carol Powell of Fort Lauderdale, and with matching funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities and from the Florida state government.

=== Randell Research Center ===

In 1996, the Randell family gave of a , internationally significant Pineland Site Complex in Lee County to the University of Florida, which the museum now operates as the Randell Research Center. This research and education program is an extension of the museum&#x27;s Southwest Florida Project and &quot;Year of the Indian&quot; archeology/education project.

In 2008, the Randell Research Center completed a two-year program to plant more than 800 native trees to replace ones destroyed in the 2004 hurricanes Charley and Frances.

=== McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity ===
In 2000, William W. McGuire, then CEO of UnitedHealth Group, gave a $4.2 million gift to establish the William W. and Nadine M. McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity. This gift was one of the largest private gifts ever given to foster research on insects, and was matched from the State of Florida Alec Courtelis Facilities Enhancement Challenge Grant Program. The McGuires later gave another $3 million to fund final construction of the center. This new $12 million facility for Lepidoptera research and public exhibits opened in August 2004.

The center houses a collection of more than 10 million butterfly and moth specimens, making it one of the largest collections of Lepidoptera in the world, rivaling that of the Natural History Museum in London. The collection includes extinct species. It started with around four million specimens, with space for significant further expansion. The collection brings together those from the Allyn Museum in Sarasota, other University of Florida collections, and the State of Florida&#x27;s Division of Plant Industry collections.
The McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity serves both research and public education functions. The center includes the living Butterfly Rainforest and exhibit space that features information about Lepidoptera and rain forests worldwide, as well as of research laboratories and collection space.

The research space includes laboratories focusing on molecular genetics, scanning electron microscopy, image analysis, conservation and captive propagation of endangered species, optical microscopy, and specimen preparation, as well as classrooms and offices for 12 faculty curators, collection managers, and other staff. Some of the research laboratories and collections can be viewed through glass panels at the back of the museum.

== Public exhibits ==

=== Butterfly Rainforest ===
The Butterfly Rainforest is a display of live butterflies in a large, outdoor enclosed space attached to the museum. It is the main exhibit in the McGuire Center which is accessed from the main entrance of Powell Hall. At any given time, the exhibit contains over 50 species of butterfly and moth species, totaling some 1,000 individuals. The butterflies are brought from around the world as chrysalises and released into the exhibit after emerging as adults. There are live butterfly releases every weekday at 2 p.m.

=== Florida Fossils: Evolution of Life &amp; Land ===
Located in Powell Hall, the $2.5 million, exhibit describes the history of the Florida Platform through five geologic time periods. The exhibition takes visitors on a walk through time beginning in the Eocene epoch, when Florida was underwater. Visitors travel through the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs and see Florida&#x27;s first land animals, evolving grasslands and savannahs and the land bridge between North and South America that formed about 3 million years ago. The exhibit ends with the arrival of the first humans in Florida near the end of the Pleistocene.

Over 90 percent of the exhibit&#x27;s 500 fossils are real, and many were found within of Gainesville.

The entrance to the hall showcases six fossil shark jaws, ranging in height from 2–9 feet. The exhibition begins with five extinction events described in dioramas that lead visitors onto the Florida Platform at about 66 million years ago, also known as the Dawn of the Age of Mammals. Displays include a primitive-toothed whale in the Eocene, a pig-like, extinct mammal from the Oligocene, a Miocene rhinoceros being attacked by two saber-toothed, cat-like animals, a -tall sloth standing on its hind legs in the Pliocene area and a 500,000-year-old jaguar chasing a peccary from the Pleistocene epoch. The time periods also include artwork by paleoartists from around the world, including a -tall steel sculpture of an extinct Terror Bird, Titanis walleri.

=== South Florida People &amp; Environments ===
This exhibit, is also in Powell Hall, the South Florida Hall consists of ten exhibit galleries that occupy a total of . The sequence of galleries is designed to give visitors a variety of experiences, including 3-D immersion environments and more focused learning centers.

Visitors enter the exhibit through a re-created scene of a Calusa fishing village as it may have looked about 500 years ago. A young Calusa boy carries home a shark on his shoulder, and behind him lies the village and view toward the Gulf of Mexico. Just past the village are four large glass wall panels depicting southwest Florida Indian art and environments. These images suggest the richness and complexity of both the cultural and natural history of the region. Beyond the panels is an orientation area, large enough for docents and teachers to gather a small group and introduce the exhibit. Interpretive panels preview the content and themes of the hall, augmented by a collage mural of south Florida people and environments.

==== Mangrove Boardwalk Gallery ====
Visitors walk onto a wooden boardwalk into a full-scale re-creation of a southwest Florida mangrove forest and sea grass estuary. The boardwalk passes through mangrove trees, mudflats, and simulated water. Insect, bird, and water sounds combine with slow changes in lighting to capture the feeling of the environment. A huge 360-degree mural painting extends the view to distant barrier islands, bird rookeries, an upland area, and the heart of mangrove forests. Interpretive panels introduce the critical stories of the rich estuarine environment.

==== Natural Habitats Center ====
This gallery features exhibits about the environments of South Florida.

==== Underwater Walk-through ====

This gallery features a 12-times life-size underwater scene to explore the tiny organisms that sustain the estuary. Large sculptures of plants, fish, and invertebrates surround the walkway, and shimmering underwater light adds a sense of reality to the scene.

==== Fishing Heritage Gallery ====
The Fishing Heritage Gallery tells the story of 6,000 years of fishing. This artifact-rich gallery highlights 6,000 years of fishing along Florida&#x27;s Gulf coast. Displays focus on the fishing industry of the Calusa, their predecessors, and traditions that carried into the 20th century. We explore the significance of maritime adaptation as a basis for social and political complexity. Included are topics such as fish, nets, native and post-contact fishing techniques, watercraft, and waterworks. Visitors will learn about the remarkable engineering endeavors of the Calusa, who constructed large canals across southwest Florida; and the long-lived net-fishing tradition. Interactive multimedia stations illustrate topics such as net making and cordage manufacture, and a miniature diorama of a fishing village captures the essence of Calusa fishing. Artifacts include 1,000-year-old palm-fiber fishing nets, Calusa net-making tools, a wide range of shell tools, and an ancient wooden canoe paddle.

==== Calusa Mound and Village ====
The dominant feature of this gallery is a large picture window and view of an outdoor mound. Sculptures of a Calusa family stand on the mound next to a palm-thatched house, suggesting that the visitor is looking outside and into the past. Inside, interpretive panels discuss mounds and Calusa town plans. Next to the window, an interactive model shows a cutaway view of a mound and explains archaeologists&#x27; methods of interpreting the past.

==== Calusa Leader&#x27;s House ====
This gallery showcases the society of the Calusa through a dramatic re-created scene. Visitors enter a palm-thatched building and find themselves in a Calusa leader&#x27;s house during a political ceremony. Subdued lights and sounds of singing add drama to a scene of six human sculptures, based on known individuals from historic Spanish documents. The setting is the Calusa capital town of Calos, about the year 1564. A distant chief is visiting the Calusa leader and his close associates. Interpretive panels explain topics such as Calusa politics, social organization, and spiritual beliefs. Artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collections complement the stories and include shell, bone, and metal ornaments as well as objects traded to the Calusa from places as far away as Missouri.

==== South Florida&#x27;s Native American Legacy Gallery ====
The Legacy Gallery presents some of the most rare and interesting objects in the South Florida collections. These include a 1,000-year-old hand-carved wooden panel with a painting of the near-extinct ivory-billed woodpecker, a wooden panel with a painted alligator, wooden figurines of animals and humans, ornaments made from precious metals, and numerous other carved wooden and bone objects. Interpretive panels discuss South Florida sites of special significance, including the remarkable &quot;wet sites&quot; that can yield detailed information when excavated with care and when recovered objects are appropriately treated. A multimedia interactive further explains the process of properly preserving and caring for wet-site materials.

==== Today&#x27;s South Florida Indian People ====
This gallery is devoted to the Indian people who live in South Florida today: the Seminole and Miccosukee. Interpretive panels address their history and their living traditions. Display cases feature many of the interesting objects from the museum&#x27;s collections, including patchwork clothing, woodwork, basketry, silverwork, and artifacts from early Seminole sites.

=== Northwest Florida: Waterways &amp; Wildlife ===
This area is designed so that visitors move through different habitats as if they were traveling westward in the Florida panhandle.

First there is hammock forest with a highly detailed, -high wrap-around mural featuring 50 different plants and animals located from high in the trees to under logs on the forest floor.

The cave is a continuing exhibit from Dickinson Hall, and shows the inside of a northwest Florida cave, modeled after one found in Marianna Caverns State Park. There is information about minerals, hydrology, cave life and the fossils found in the cave&#x27;s limestone layers.

The pitcher plant bog exhibit was modeled after bog communities around Eglin Air Force Base. Seepage bogs are characterized by saturated, highly acidic, sandy soil and are dominated by low growing plant species, such as grasses and carnivorous plants. A related exhibit with a change in scale shows larger-than-life pitcher plants.

The river scene represents 700 years ago on the banks of the Apalachicola River, with a 360-degree wraparound forest mural. There is also a Native American trading scene from 1300 AD showing an exchange between peoples of the Fort Walton culture and the Etowah. Northwest Florida rivers are filled with fossilized remains of now-extinct vertebrate animal species, and examples of these are featured in this exhibit along with many archaeological and ethnographic artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collections.

The tidal march exhibit explains why the tidal marsh is an important ecosystem and what the specialized adaptations are that needed to survive there, as the changing tides constantly alter water and salinity levels.

A coastal diorama depicts dune habitats from the barrier islands from Panama City to Pensacola, and shows an osprey in flight, bird nests from the museum&#x27;s collections, a cross-section of a sea turtle nest and coastal water sounds.

The final exhibit in this section is a floor-to-ceiling curved lagoon case, depicting how different sessile intertidal species stratify their habitats in the tidal zone. Jars with preserved specimens from the Ichthyology collection demonstrate the diversity of bony fishes from this habitat.

=== Florida Wildflower and Butterfly Garden ===
This garden is located next to the west side of the McGuire Center. The Florida Wildflower Council appropriated funds from the Florida wildflower license tag revenue in order to fund this garden, the accompanying brochure, and a wildflower and butterfly display in the Florida Museum of Natural History. The display shows the life cycles of four butterflies, and depicts how the plants they use change in appearance over the four seasons.

=== Changing Gallery ===
 The Changing Gallery is a hall, also located in Powell Hall, which has hosted the Megalodon Exhibit, Hatching the Past, Chocolate, Tibet Exhibit and Sue the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and Inside Africa, both from the Field Museum in Chicago, Il.

 exhibits include &quot;Permian Monsters: Life Before the Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Whale People: Protectors of the Sea.&quot;

From October 7, 2023 to April 21, 2024 the Changing Gallery hosted &quot;Antarctic Dinosaurs&quot;, also from the Field Museum.

== Research collections ==
With the exception of the Lepidoptera collection, located in the McGuire Center, almost all other research collections are located in Dickinson Hall.

=== Lepidoptera ===
This collection, unlike the rest of the museum&#x27;s collections, is housed at the McGuire Center. This department is relatively new when compared to the other collections and departments although their research is quite extensive.

=== Mammalogy ===
Since 1992, the mammalogy collection at Dickinson Hall has undergone rapid growth and expansion. Between 1979 and 2007, the collection has doubled, increasing from 14,000 to over 30,000 specimens. Since 2002, the Florida Museum has acquired the University of Miami&#x27;s cetacean collection and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s manatee collection.
The mammalogy collection has roughly 30,618 cataloged specimens and approximately 1,000 non-cataloged specimens. It consists primarily of skins and skulls, although entire skeletons have been prepared from all specimens acquired since 1992. There are 205 large tanned skins and 4,500, roughly 16% of the collection, has been preserved in fluid. The collection is preponderated by small mammals, primarily rodents and bats, from the southeastern US, the Caribbean, Latin America, South-America and 2,600 specimens from Pakistan.
An important component of the mammalogy collection is the marine mammal collection, consisting of 310 manatee, dolphin and over five hundred whales. The large size of the collection is the result of a long-term cooperative effort with the U.S. National Biological Service&#x27;s Sirenia research project, Marine Mammal Stranding Network, researchers David and Melba Caldwell, and Marineland of Florida. Other major collections that have been acquired and/or cataloged over the past 15 years include:

* Cross Florida Barge Canal collection (Florida Game &amp; Fresh Water Fish Commission - 1,800 small mammals)
* Bowen collection of beach mice, Peromyscus polionotus (Bowen 1968) - 3,400
* James Layne collection of small mammals from Archbold Biological Station (2,100).
* Involvement with the Florida Panther Recovery Program has resulted in the only significant collection of this endangered subspecies in the entire United States with fewer than 50 individuals.
Average growth rate of the collection between 1989 and 1994 is 640 specimens per year, and 800 specimens per year for the previous 5 years; this is double the growth recorded for 1972-1979 of 290 specimens per year as reported in the survey of North American collections of recent mammals. Orphaned or donated collections account for approximately 60% of reported growth. 
The mammal collection is primarily a research collection, but experiences a broad range of uses beyond this primary function. It is used as a teaching collection for undergraduate and graduate students; reference collection for law enforcement as a forensic identification of endangered species; as a reference collection for carnivore feeding studies i.e. owl pellet and scat analysis; a comparative material for students and faculty of zoo archeology and vertebrate paleontology (post-cranial skeletal collection). As part of a large university, the uses of the collection are diverse including applications in biomedical studies, wildlife dentistry, and even studies of environmental contaminants. As the concern for Florida&#x27;s environment increases, so does the monitoring of habitats and species by state and federal biologists, resulting in an increased interest in the historical and recent distributions of mammals in Florida by a variety of state and federal agencies.

=== Ichthyology ===
The Florida Museum of Natural History ichthyological collection was ranked as the tenth most important fish specimen resource in the North America and the second highest by the ranking National Center by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. Since that survey was completed, the 65,000 lot University of Miami collection was transferred and is currently being integrated into complete collection.

The collection itself contains more than 197,000 cataloged lots of which there are 2.15 million specimens, representing more than 7,000 species. In addition, there is an unsorted backlog of about 25,000 lots, about 250,000 specimens. Most of the uncatalogued and backlog material was acquired through transfer of the important collections previously housed at the National Marine Fisheries Service biological laboratories in Miami, Pascagoula, MS, and the University of Miami. The collection currently contains primary and secondary types of more than 325 taxa of freshwater and marine fishes.

The osteological collection comprises 2,500 lots of disarticulated skeletons representing over 320 species. Skeletal holdings emphasize the southeastern United States, Caribbean, Central American and northwestern South American ichthyofaunas. Representative specimens of over 200 species have been cleared and stained. A radiograph collection and the original field notes of numerous individuals and organizations, including station sheets for virtually all U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/National Marine Fisheries Service and University of Miami research vessels, are maintained.

The principal strengths of the fish collection are, in approximate order of importance, its holdings of (1) western and eastern Atlantic shelf and deep water marine fishes, (2) western Atlantic reef fishes, (3) North American freshwater fishes, especially from the southeastern United States, and (4) freshwater fishes from certain parts of Central America, South America and the West Indies. Of the above, categories (1), and (2) are nearly equal in importance.

Most of the material acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Tropical Atlantic Biological (TABL) collection consists of western Atlantic fishes from nearshore shallows to moderate depths, with the families Argentinidae, Atherinidae, Balistidae, Batrachoididae, Belonidae, Bothidae, Branchiostomatidae, Caproidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae, Congridae, Cynoglossidae, Dasyatidae, Engraulididae, Exocoetidae, Fundulidae, Gadidae, Gerreidae, Haemulidae, Hemiramphidae, Lutjanidae, Macrouridae, Monacanthidae, Mugilidae, Ogcocephalidae, Ophichthidae, Ophidiidae, Paralichthyidae, Peristediidae, Priacanthidae, Rajidae, Sciaenidae, Scombridae, Serranidae, Scorpaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Soleidae, Sparidae, Sphyraenidae, Stromateidae, Squalidae, Syngnathidae, Synodontidae, Tetraodontidae, and Triglidae most common. These collections have been substantially augmented by the field activities of museum personnel and donations made over the last 20 years. Eastern Atlantic collections from the Gulf of Guinea are available in some abundance. The western Atlantic collections acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Pascagoula laboratory and University of Miami are generally from greater depths and represent some of the museum&#x27;s most valuable resources. Deepwater anguilliform, salmoniform, stomiiform, aulopiform, myctophiform, and ophidiiform families are particularly well represented. For certain families, i.e. Searsiidae, Alepocephalidae, these collections may be among the best North American holdings from the western Atlantic region.

The holdings of western Atlantic reef fishes are among the most important in existence, with the following geographic areas most heavily collected: Florida, the Bahamas, Isla de Providencia, the Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands and the Lesser Antilles. Smaller numbers of reef fish collections exist from Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Sombrero Island, other Lesser Antilles islands, continental islands off northern South America, Brazil, and Ascension Island. There are a substantial number of reef fishes from off the Carolinas. Major reef groups represented include the Acanthuridae, Antennariidae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Chaenopsidae, Chaetodontidae, Clinidae, Dactyloscopidae, Gobiesocidae, Gobiidae, Grammistidae, Haemulidae, Holocentridae, Kyphosidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Muraenidae, Ostraciidae, Opistognathidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Serranidae, and Tripterygiidae. Eastern Pacific reef collections are present from the Pearl Islands south to Ecuador. Also available are a fair number of Indo-Pacific reef fishes acquired by staff collecting and by donations received from the Bishop Museum and the National Museum of Natural History. Over 200 shore and estuarine collections have been made from the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama.

The museum&#x27;s worldwide holdings of elasmobranchs, particularly squaloid sharks, have grown rapidly in the last 15 years and are an important international resource. Other elasmobranch groups prominently represented include Carcharhinidae, Dasyatidae, Gymnuridae, Myliobatidae, Rajidae, Rhinobatidae, Scyliorhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Squatinidae, Torpedinidae and Triakidae.

Holdings of freshwater fishes are greatest from the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. In addition, an effort has been made to obtain as complete a taxonomic and geographic coverage of freshwater species as possible from throughout North America. As a result, over 90 percent of the freshwater fish species from the United States and Canada are represented in the collection. Best represented are members of the Catostomidae, Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, Elassomatidae, Fundulidae, Ictaluridae, Lepisosteidae, Percidae, Petromyzontidae and Poeciliidae. Freshwater fishes from Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, Hispaniola, Guatemala, Panama and Costa Rica are currently represented in moderate to large numbers in the collection. The Florida Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Hispaniolan holdings are unsurpassed and the Venezuelan holdings are growing continuously. A wide spectrum of characoid, gymnotoid and siluroid families, cichlids, and poeciliids are especially well represented

=== Malacology ===
 The mollusk collection was initiated through the efforts of T. van Hyning, the first director of the museum, and was small and composed mostly of local taxa until 1965. In 1973, the mollusk collection consisted of 22,174 cataloged lots and ranked 19th in the US. The collection has grown rapidly since, through numerous field surveys and acquisition of relinquished collections. Since 2000, Malacology has also hosted a growing collection of non-molluscan marine invertebrates. About 100,000 species of mollusks are known, and the collection holds over 30,000 species among 400,000 lots of specimens. Over 300,000 lots are now databased and accessible online. The collection is among the five largest in the US, and one of the most rapidly growing. It is second largest mollusk collection in the world in online accessibility.

The collection is especially strong in regional taxa. Malacology has one of the largest collections of terrestrial and freshwater mollusks from the southeastern US. Overall marine mollusks comprise 38% of cataloged holdings; freshwater species make up 18% and terrestrial taxa 44%. Gastropods comprise 83%, bivalves 16%, while all other mollusk classes combined &lt;1% of the collection. Three quarters of the collection is from the Western Hemisphere, while 18% is from tropical Australasia and surrounding Pacific and Indian Ocean islands. The mollusk collection has unique strengths in land, freshwater and marine mollusks. The museum has the largest land snail collection in the world from Hispaniola, Mexico-Central America, Pakistan and Thailand, and also has especially large holdings from the southeastern United States, West Indies, Andean South America, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Freshwater mollusk collections are strong for the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, Andean South America, and the Philippines. Large subtropical and tropical West Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific holdings characterize the marine collection, and tropical marine collections are undergoing rapid growth. These strengths reflect a former regional focus of the museum and research focus of the curators: on terrestrial and freshwater mollusks of Middle America and Southeast Asia, and on tropical marine mollusks, respectively.

=== Botany and the Florida Herbarium ===
 The botany collection is an excellent representation of the vascular flora of Florida and the southeastern United States coastal plain, including abundant material from the 19th century. The bryophyte and lichen collections encompass Florida and tropical areas, especially Costa Rica, Venezuela and Brazil. The Fungal Herbarium is exhibits Florida fungi, especially agarics and polypores, and the wood collection is worldwide with a tropical emphasis. The addition of a preeminent brings the total museum botanical collection holdings to around one-half of a million specimens.

Noteworthy additions include the A. A. Cuthbert Herbarium of approximately 5000 specimens, the plant holdings of the Florida State Museum (4711 specimens, including the Herbarium of S. C. Hood), several thousand more S. C. Hood collections, 15770 specimens of lichens, liverworts and mosses collected by Severin Rapp, wood blocks and vouchers of American wood and economic trees from the New York State School of Forestry, George E. Ritchey specimens from the U. S. Plant Introduction Garden, Edward and Robert P. St. John Florida ferns, innumerable West and Arnold collections and those received through inter-institutional exchange. The herbarium also benefited from the prominent studies of H. Harold Hume (Zephyranthes, Ilex, and Camellia) and William A. Murrill (Crataegus and fungi) and in 1989 Angus K. Gholson, Jr. donated his entire herbarium (15,000 specimens), library and related equipment and supplies. This is an excellent collection especially rich in its representation of the flora of the Florida Panhandle.

=== Herpetology ===
 With approximately 202,000 specimens, the herpetology collection is estimated to be the 9th largest in the US. Its skeletal collection, with more than 11,000 disarticulated skeletons and a small number of cleared and stained specimens, is 5th largest. An average of 3,800 specimens a year are catalogued. The collection contains 60 holotypes and 919 paratypes representing 176 taxa. Additional taxa are in the process of being described.

Though worldwide in scope, the collection contains approximately 2,300 species from the Neotropics, 600 from Asia, 390 from the Nearctic, 350 from Africa, 275 from the Palearctic, and 220 from Australia/Oceania. Large holdings of land tortoises and varanid lizards resulted from Walter Auffenberg&#x27;s research, and his work on the &quot;Herpetology of Pakistan&quot; produced the world&#x27;s largest Pakistan collection. Large numbers of sea turtles came from Archie Carr and his students. Wayne King&#x27;s surveys of Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guyana, assembled the largest collection of Latin American crocodilians. Sizable collections of Kinosternid turtles were donated by John Iverson, softshells by Peter Meylan, and Panama amphibians and reptiles by the late Howard W. Campbell. Samuel R. Telford, Jr., provided extensive collections from Japan, Burma, Panama, Venezuela, Tanzania, and Pakistan, and smaller numbers from Zaire, Thailand and the Philippines. Recorded vocalizations of 46 species of amphibians and 20 species of reptiles are catalogued in the museum&#x27;s Bioacoustic Archives.

=== Ornithology ===
 The recent bird skeleton collection of 24,500 specimens, representing about 3,000 species, is approximately fifth largest in the world in number of specimens and species. In 1992, the museum received the recent bird skeleton collection assembled by Prof. Pierce Brodkorb of the University of Florida&#x27;s Department of Zoology. The skeleton collection has grown by 140% since 2002. It contains specimens from 47 U.S. states and 103 countries.

The largest collections by state:
The top ten countries are:
Taxonomically the collection ranges across the class Aves, representing 23 orders, 128 families, and 950 genera.

The bird skin collection contains approximately 20,500 specimens representing at least 2,300 species. These are mostly study skins, but in recent years the division has prepared a large proportion of new specimens as flat skins or spread wings with associated skeletons. In 1992, the division also received a collection of approximately 3,000 skins. The skin collection has grown by 23% in the last five years. Also wide-ranging taxonomically, it represents 27 orders, 129 families, and 850 genera. Rarities include skins of ivory-billed woodpeckers and extinct dusky seaside sparrows, passenger pigeons, and Carolina parakeets.

The egg collection, consisting of 10,400 sets representing 733 species, is 11th largest in North America in number of sets and 15th largest in number of species. It represents approximately 90% of the species and subspecies of North American birds. The egg collection has grown by 1% in the last five years. It is cataloged in a card file that includes original collectors&#x27; data slips or page references to the collector&#x27;s field notes. Especially well represented are sets from New England and Florida. The collection is rich in sets of raptor eggs, including bald eagles, ospreys, broad-winged hawks, red-shouldered hawks, crested caracaras, American kestrels, the Florida races of seaside sparrows and clapper rails. Rarities include sets of passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, and Bachman&#x27;s warbler eggs.

The bird sound collection, in the museum Bioacoustic Archives, with 20,500 cataloged recordings representing about 3,000 species, is the fourth largest in the world in number of species. In the Western Hemisphere it is the second largest in number of species and third largest in number of recordings. The sound collection is completely cataloged in an electronic database, and the sound recordings themselves were digitized over a five-year period beginning in 2009 with help from $446,000 National Science Foundation grant. The sound recordings are available online.

Geographical strengths include North America, especially Florida, and the Neotropics, with smaller but notable numbers of recordings from Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Some taxonomic groups especially well represented are tinamous, trogons, woodpeckers, antbirds, New World flycatchers, wrens, New World wood warblers, and corvids.

=== Vertebrate Paleontology ===
The FLMNH vertebrate fossil collections feature rich samples of all vertebrate classes, mainly from the Cenozoic Era. Included are about 400,000 specimens. Holotypes number about 200 specimens. The FLMNH vertebrate fossil collections also include the former Florida Geological Survey Collection and the UF Department of Zoology Fossil Bird Collection. Each of these collections is maintained in a separate catalog, under the acronyms UF/FGS and UF/PB, respectively. The FLMNH collections provide the most complete basis available for study of Cenozoic vertebrate paleontology in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean Basin.

===== University of Florida (UF) Collection =====
The UF collection currently contains about 385,000 specimens assigned to over 234,000 unique catalogue numbers and over 150 holotypes. The UF collection has experienced rapid, sometimes explosive, growth since the 1950s and now ranks in the top five nationally in terms of total catalogued specimens. Consistent with our museum&#x27;s mission as the official repository for Florida&#x27;s natural history specimens, about 90 percent of this collection comes from about 1,000 separate localities throughout Florida. A particular strength of the UF collection is the extraordinary array of land-animals from the past 25 million years in Florida, forming the best record documenting the evolution of ancient vertebrate life in eastern North America over this interval. Other major strengths of the UF collection include extensive holdings from Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and other Caribbean islands, fossils from Central and South America (especially Bolivia, Honduras, and Panama), and specimens from the late Eocene to Oligocene &quot;Badlands&quot; of western Nebraska. On-going field work begun by our new curator Jonathan Bloch in 2004 will over time produce a significant collection of Paleocene and early Eocene vertebrates from basins in Wyoming and Montana.

Prior to 1953, the UF collection consisted of only a few hundred specimens, mostly acquired through public donation, and of little scientific value. Beginning in 1953, serious fossil prospecting began at the University of Florida, initially led by Robert S. Bader and Walter A. Auffenberg, both then members of the Department of Biology. Clayton Ray became the museum&#x27;s first curator of vertebrate paleontology in 1959. He left in 1963 to take a position at the Smithsonian. Recognizing the importance of vertebrate paleontology in Florida, in 1964 museum director J. C. Dickinson hired two vertebrate paleontology curators, S. David Webb and Thomas H. Patton. Together they quickly moved the museum&#x27;s research program to the forefront of the field, symbolized by their hosting in Gainesville the prestigious annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in the fall of 1964, the first time this meeting had been held in the Southeastern United States. Patton left in the mid-1970s to pursue a career in the legal profession, and was replaced in 1977 by Bruce J. MacFadden. Webb retired in 2003, and Jonathan I. Bloch was hired to fill the vacant curator position. Since 1964 the FLMNH VP curators have mentored many dozens of graduate students, produced numerous books, monographs, and research papers, and directed field operations in Florida, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the western U.S. Another important feat was the creation of the Florida Paleontological Society and the forming of a strong bond between the professional paleontologists at the museum and the amateur fossil collectors throughout the state of Florida. Although technically curators in other museum divisions, Walter Auffenberg (Herpetology) and Charles A. Woods (Mammalogy) both had research interests that included paleontology and helped build the collection.

In addition to the curators, other full-time staff at the FLMNH have made significant contributions to the UF collections. The first fossil preparator was Howard H. Converse, who worked at the museum from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. He was followed by Russell McCarty, who retired in 2006. Jason Bourque is the current vertebrate paleontology preparator and studies fossil and living turtles. Gary S. Morgan was collections manager from 1981 through 1993, and oversaw the curation of massive numbers of specimens from the Love Bone Bed, Thomas Farm, Leisey Shell Pit, Bone Valley, Haiti, and elsewhere. He was replaced by Marc Frank (1994–1998) and Richard C. Hulbert (2000–present).

===== Florida Geological Survey Collection =====
The Florida Geological Survey fossil vertebrate collection (FGS) was started during the 1910s and was originally housed in Tallahassee. Under the direction of E. H. Sellards, Herman Gunter, and S. J. Olsen, the FGS collection was the primary source of fossil vertebrate descriptions from Florida until the early 1960s. World-renowned paleontologists such as George G. Simpson, Edwin H. Colbert, and Henry F. Osborn wrote scientific papers about specimens in the FGS collection in addition to Sellards and Olsen. In 1976 the entire FGS fossil vertebrate collection was transferred to the Florida Museum of Natural History with support from a National Science Foundation grant. The UF/FGS collection is composed of about 22,000 specimens assigned to about 10,000 catalogue numbers, and almost all of them were collected in Florida. The majority of specimens in the UF/FGS collection are mammals, followed by reptiles, birds, and a relatively small number of amphibians and fish. Although there are some sites that are unique to the UF/FGS collection, many of the sites overlap with holdings in the main UF and UF/PB collections. The major strengths of the UF/FGS collection are historically important samples from the early Miocene Thomas Farm locality, the middle Miocene and early Pliocene deposits of the Bone Valley Region, Polk County, and from the late Pleistocene Vero locality, Indian River County.

===== Pierce Brodkorb Collection =====
The Pierce Brodkorb Collection (UF/PB) was amassed by Professor Brodkorb of the University of Florida over his career as one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts on fossil birds. His heirs donated his extensive collections of modern bird skeletons and fossil birds to the Florida Museum of Natural History in 1992. The modern skeletons are housed by the museum&#x27;s Ornithology collection. Brodkorb&#x27;s fossil bird collection was curated and computer cataloged with support from the National Science Foundation. The UF/PB collection is composed of about 8,500 cataloged specimens and includes 42 holotypes. About 85 per cent of the UF/PB specimens were collected in Florida, and range in age from early Miocene to latest Pleistocene. Other large holdings are Pleistocene birds from Bermuda and the Bahamas.

=== Archaeology ===
==== Environmental Archaeology ====
The Environmental Archaeology Program (EAP) of the Florida Museum was established by Dr. Elizabeth Wing in the early 1960s (as the Zooarchaeology collection) and was curated by her until her retirement in 2001. The EAP collections include archaeological animal, plant, and soil materials that represent 14,000 years of human-environmental relationships in the early circum-Caribbean Americas (including the SE USA, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America). The collections are strongest in zoological specimens (modern comparative and zooarchaeological), but since the 1990s have grown to include significant holdings of both archaeobotanical/botanical and archaeopedological materials. Environmental archaeology, a subdiscipline of anthropology, reconstructs the long relationship between people and environments using biotic (animal and plant) and abiotic (geological) remains from archaeological sites. The EAP researchers focus on integrated analyses that explore every aspect of that relationship, from the environmental conditions during human occupation, to human use of and impact on natural resources, to human perceptions and symbolic interpretations of aspects of the plants, animals, and landscapes of their environments.

==== Caribbean Archaeology ====

The Caribbean Archeology Program Collection was founded in 1960 by Dr. Ripley P. Bullen. The program is based around one of the largest systematic collections of pre-Columbian artifacts in North America. What the collection lacks in size is compensated for by its diversity. The collection contains systematic collections from sites on the islands of Antigua, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Marie-Galante, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, St. Martin, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Tobago, Trinidad, Turks and Caicos, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Venezuela, each collection has accompanying documentation.

The &quot;Bullen&quot; collection was recently re-inventoried and reorganized. During this reorganization, type collections; composed of all the artifacts illustrated in Bullen&#x27;s publications, were also created. These collection catalogs, which are based on the tables published in the Bullens&#x27; reports, are available for all of the islands and sites represented in the collection. Presently a map of the West Indies and a list of the islands and the sites represented in the collection are available to the public.

The collection includes artifacts recovered during excavations directed by Dr. Charles A. Hoffman, Jr. on the islands of Antigua and St. Kitts, a study collection derived from the excavations directed by Dr. Kathleen A. Deagan from the sites of En Bas Saline and Puerto Réal, Haiti, a collection of important artifacts donated by Mr. Leon Wilder that were surface collected from sites in Grenada and a number of artifacts recovered from sites in Jamaica and Grenada that were recently donated by Mr. Geoffrey Senior.

Survey and excavation projects are an integral part of the Caribbean Archeology Program. Since 1987, research teams from the museum have undertaken surveys and excavations in Antigua, the Bahamas, Grand Cayman, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

==== Ceramic Technology Laboratory ====
The Ceramic Technology Laboratory was established in 1977 under the direction of Dr. Prudence Rice, then UF professor of anthropology. Pottery analysis plays an integral role in archaeological research at the museum as it constitutes the predominant material remaining at most archaeological sites investigated by museum curators. In addition pottery constitutes a very significant proportion of the Anthropology collections. The Ceramic Technology Laboratory is equipped for basic paste characterization studies: binocular microscope for gross identification of temper or paste constituents; a petrographic microscope for precise mineral identification in thin section; an electric furnace used for refiring experiments and for comparative investigation of clay samples collected from the vicinity of archaeological sites. Analysis of physical and mineralogical properties of the pottery are undertaken to provide precise data to address research questions regarding chronology, provenience or manufacturing origins, processes of production, culture change, and the development of social and economic complexity in prehistoric Florida, the Southeastern US, and the Caribbean Basin. The department is committed to the continuance of this research program as the capacity for in-house specialized analysis of pottery enhances the competitiveness for research grants.

The Ceramic Technology Laboratory houses an extensive pottery type collection of prehistoric and historic period aboriginal pottery from Florida and the Southeastern U.S. The Florida materials represent type specimens assembled by Ripley Bullen, John Goggin, and Gordon Willey, pioneers of Florida archeology. The type collections serve as a primary comparative resource for museum scientists, graduate students, and visiting researchers. The Ceramic Technology Laboratory also curates fragments of pottery samples used in paste characterization studies.

==== Florida Archaeology ====

The Florida Archeology Collection includes artifacts spanning 12,000 years of human history in the Southeast. While the focus of this collection is on Florida, some materials from Georgia and other localities are included. These items are curated as a tangible record of the people who have made Florida their home. The Florida Archeology Collections come from Central and North Florida and the Panhandle regions. All counties including and north of Sarasota, De Soto, Hardee, Polk, Osceola, and Indian River counties are included in this collection. Exceptions to this rule are sites situated within Colonial St. Augustine and historical sites with no pre-Columbian material present, collections from these locales are included in the Historical Archaeology Collections. Counties to the south are part of the South Florida Archeology Collections. Information concerning policies associated with our collections are found below.

The Excavated Collections include all archaeological materials that have been excavated using systematic recovery techniques. While recovery techniques vary depending on the project, site, and supervising archaeologist, all of these collections have associated provenience data. Documentation such as field notes, maps, and photographs are often available with the collection.
Below is a select list of sites in the Florida Archeology Collections.

===== &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Old Town&quot; =====
Abraham&#x27;s Old Town or Pilaklikaha is a multicomponent site in Sumter County. The site includes a ceramic period occupation (Pasco and Sand-Tempered Plain) and possibly a preceramic component. The site&#x27;s significance is its identification as Pilaklikaha, a town inhabited by Black Seminoles during the early 19th century. The collection includes lithics, ceramics (both European and Seminole), glass beads, trade pipe fragments, bottle glass, brick, cut nails and other metal fragments recovered during excavations from 1998 to 2001.

===== &quot;Aucilla River Prehistory Project&quot; =====
The collection contains prehistoric lithic, bone and mammoth ivory tools, ceramics, historic materials, plant remains, and Pleistocene and Holocene fossils from assorted sites along the Aucilla River. Notable items in this collection include the fossilized bones of Pleistocene animals exhibiting butcher and cut marks, numerous stone Paleoindian projectile points, and carved ivory shafts.

===== &quot;Bolen Bluff&quot; =====
Bolen Bluff is a multicomponent site located south of Paynes Prairie. The site was excavated by Ripley Bullen in 1949. Large portions of the site were destroyed and used for fill during highway construction. The collections include numerous stone points and tools including: Suwannee, Bolen, Arredondo, and Pinellas points, as well as: stone adzes, hoes, drills, and scrapers. Pottery types span the entire range of ceramic periods in the area: Orange, Transitional, Deptford, Weeden Island, St. Johns, and Alachua.

===== &quot;de Soto Survey&quot; =====
The de Soto archaeological survey project was conducted from 1986–1991 to locate and identify early Spanish-Indian contact period sites in north Florida. The six surveys identified or revisited over 750 archaeological sites in 15 counties (Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, Gilchrist, Lafayette, Madison, Marion, Putnam, Sumter, Suwannee, and Union). Some of the major sites identified and excavated were: the location of the Spanish mission at Fig Springs, the Spanish mission of Santa Fe and the Indian Pond site.

===== &quot;McKeithen Site&quot; =====
The McKeithen Site is a Weeden Island (AD 200–900) site in Columbia County excavated during the late 1970s. The site is composed of a village area and three mounds. The collections from the site include an excellent variety of Weeden Island ceramics, including numerous whole or almost whole vessels from different areas of the site. The collections also include a variety of stone points and tools, grinding stones, mica, and some faunal and floral remains.

===== &quot;Richardson Site&quot; =====
The Richardson Site is a Potano Indian village near Orange Lake that dates from the late pre-Columbian and early Spanish mission period. The site provides us with valuable information on Potano houses and early Spanish missionization. Collections include a large collection of Alachua pottery, lithics, glass beads, wrought nails, and faunal material. It may be the site of the town of Potano visited by the Hernando de Soto expedition, and of the early 17th century mission of San Buenaventura de Potano.

===== &quot;Spanish Mission collections&quot; =====
The collections from Spanish mission sites are an important part of the Florida archaeological collections. The Florida Archeology curates large collections from 11 mission sites: Baptizing Spring, Fox Pond, Santa Fe, Fig Springs, Indian Pond, Scott Miller, San Juan, Beatty, Blue Bead and Baldree and the sites on Amelia Island. There are also numerous other Spanish mission period sites associated with missions or haciendas, including: Moon Lake, Richardson, Zetrouer, Carlisle, and Peacock Lake.

===== &quot;Tatham Mound&quot; =====
Tatham Mound is a Safety Harbor culture mound located near the Withlacoochee River in Citrus County. The site was also in use at the time of the Soto entrada as evidenced by numerous Spanish artifacts dating to mid-16th century. The collections include Safety Harbor ceramic vessels, Pinellas points and other lithic tools, and many shell artifacts: gorget, celt, dippers, and beads. Spanish artifacts include: metal beads and pendants, Nueva Cadiz and other glass beads, and metal artifacts including chisels, spikes, and armor fragments.

===== &quot;Donated private collections&quot; =====
Private collections donated by individuals and families represent an important aspect of the Florida Archeology collections. These collections include provenanced artifacts from all over Florida and a limited amount of material from other areas of North America. Many of these collections are from well-known sites and are valuable sources of exhibit quality artifacts and research collections. These collections range in size from small surface collections from single sites to collections that cover large portions of the state and include thousands of artifacts.
A representative sample of donated private collections curated at the museum includes the following collections organized by family name.
===== &quot;Bullen Projectile Point Typology Collection&quot; =====
The Ripley Bullen Projectile Point Type Collection is the original assortment of artifacts archeologist Ripley P. Bullen used to create the first formal point typology for Florida in 1967. Bullen&#x27;s typology was revised in 1975 and published as A Guide to the Identification of Florida Projectile Points. This collection is curated as an original reference collection for visiting researchers and the general public.

===== &quot;Osteological collections&quot; =====
Human osteological collections curated at the Florida Museum of Natural History include skeletal remains from pre-Columbian and historic archaeological sites across Florida, Georgia, and several localities in the Caribbean. These collections are maintained for research and teaching purposes. Access to these collections is limited to the academic community and professionals in the private sector involved in scholarly research.

==== Historical archaeology ====
The historical archaeology collections of the Florida Museum of Natural History consists of more than 2 million excavated specimens from more than 100 sites throughout Florida and Latin America. They include the largest known systematic collection of Spanish colonial archaeological specimens in the country, representing sites of domestic, military, religious and commercial sites dating from 1492 through the 19th century.

The collection also incorporates archaeological specimens from a variety of non-Spanish 18th- and 19th-century sites, including homesteads, plantations, trading posts, forts and towns.

In addition to systematic collections resulting form excavation, the Historical Archeology Department also maintains extensive collections of type specimens, comparative specimens and published specimens for historical archeology. The materials span the period of 1493–1900, and are used extensively as a reference collection, a comparative collection and a teaching collection.

===== &quot;The St. Augustine Collections&quot; =====
The materials from St. Augustine, Florida (1565–present) were generated by systematic archaeological excavations from a forty-year period (1959–1999) on 33 Spanish colonial, British colonial, African American, American Indian and post-colonial sites in St. Augustine, Florida. They include more than 1 million items of glass, metals, stone, shell and bone. They are curated jointly by the University of Florida, the Florida Division of Historical Resources and the City of St. Augustine at the museum.

===== &quot;The Latin American Collections&quot; =====
Some of the earliest historical archaeology collections in the region are found in our collection. John Goggin&#x27;s ambitious program of historical archeology during the 1940s and 1950s generated a large collection of materials from sites throughout the Caribbean and Central America. His collaborations with such researchers as Emile Boyrie of the Dominican Republic, José Cruxent of Venezuela and Irving Rouse of Yale additionally resulted in the exchange of smaller comparative collections from throughout the region.

Excavations in Haiti conducted by Charles Fairbanks and Kathleen Deagan between 1979 and 1988 also generated two large Historic-era collections that are being curated at the Florida Museum of Natural History on behalf of the Haitian government.

===== &quot;The Historical Florida Collections&quot; =====
In addition to the collections from St. Augustine and Latin America, the Historical Archeology collections also include materials excavated from a variety of towns, missions, plantations and forts in Florida and the southeastern United States.

<text>A modern award (or award previously known as an &quot;industrial award&quot;) is a ruling in Australian labour law of the national Fair Work Commission (or its predecessor) or by a state industrial relations commission which grants all wage earners in one industry or occupation the same minimum pay rates and conditions of employment such as leave entitlements, overtime and shift work, as well as other workplace-related conditions. The national awards, with the National Employment Standards, provide a minimum safety net of terms and conditions of employment for all national system employees. The pay rates are often called award wages or award rates. Awards in Australia are part of the system of compulsory arbitration in industrial relations.

==History==
Federal awards in Australia were stripped back to number 122 under the Abbott government, to promote the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement system. 

A similar system was also used in New Zealand prior to the &quot;Labour Relations Act 1987&quot;. New Zealand no longer uses the award system, and the only form of collective bargaining is collective agreements, which apply only to the particular unions and employers that negotiate them.

<text>Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller (June 17, 1907 – April 21, 1999) was the first wife of Nelson A. Rockefeller, the 49th governor of New York and the 41st vice president of the United States. She served as the first lady of New York from 1959 until the Rockefellers&#x27; divorce in March 1962. After their divorce, Nelson Rockefeller remained governor and would later become the 41st vice president of the United States, serving under President Gerald Ford.

==Early life==
Known as &quot;Tod&quot; to her family, Mary was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia on June 17, 1907. She was the daughter of Elizabeth Williams (née Roberts) Clark and Percy Hamilton Clark, an attorney and noted cricketer. Among her siblings were two brothers, John R. Clark and Dr. Thomas W. Clark.

Her maternal grandfather was George B. Roberts, a former president of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Tod attended the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia and studied at the Sorbonne in France, but didn&#x27;t graduate, instead returning to Philadelphia where she made her debut and became active in the Junior League.

==Career==
In 1932, Mary began volunteering at the Bellevue School of Nursing in Manhattan, which was administered with Bellevue Hospital. She served on the school&#x27;s board for many years, including a stint as the board president.

==Personal life==
On June 23, 1930, Mary married Nelson Rockefeller, a grandson of John D. Rockefeller, at St. Asaph&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, with a reception at the home of her parents, a few days after Nelson had graduated from Dartmouth College. They had five children:

* Rodman Clark Rockefeller (1932–2000)
* Ann Rockefeller Roberts (1934–2024), a founder and president of the Fund of the Four Directions.
* Steven Clark Rockefeller (b. 1936), a former dean of Middlebury College.
* Mary Rockefeller Callard (b. 1938), Michael&#x27;s twin.
* Michael Clark Rockefeller (1938–1961), who disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Netherlands New Guinea.

Mary divorced her husband on March 16, 1962 in Reno, Nevada on grounds of extreme mental cruelty. A year later, &quot;Happy&quot; Murphy became the governor&#x27;s second wife.

She died at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1999 at the age of 91.

<doc id="1143824" wikidata="Q17016530" url="?curid=1143824" title="Le Mans Academy">
<text>LeMans Academy (formerly Sacred Heart Military Academy) was a private Catholic boarding middle school (grades 5-9) for boys located 90 minutes east of Chicago, Illinois, near La Porte, Indiana, on 700 acres (2.8 km2) of land. It was sponsored by the Brothers of Holy Cross from the University of Notre Dame. It was founded in 1955 in Watertown, Wisconsin.

==History==
Sacred Heart Military Academy (called SHMA by the students) operated in Watertown, Wisconsin, until the summer of 1968. After graduating its last class, the school was moved to Rolling Prairie, Indiana. The name was changed, in part, because the brothers in Watertown kept receiving applications from the parents of girls.

The last class consisted mostly of boys from the Milwaukee and Chicago areas with many from Mexico. Student activities included military drills, a rifle range, a large gym, soccer, track, baseball, and other sports. The school also had a slot car track and recreation room. The students wore military uniforms every day and a special dress uniform on Sunday. Boys held different ranks and received demerits for bad behavior. Demerits had to be worked off with calisthenics and stress positions like bending at the waist with hands clasped behind the head. Offenses like fighting earned the use of &quot;the paddle&quot;. Students were required to learn Drill. Students were not allowed to carry money or to leave the campus. Students were allowed phone calls on a certain night of the week. Students were not allowed to go home for a few days on break, (Weekend Break) should they have too many Demerits. Students were required to stay in their rooms after 9:00 P.M. Students Study halls were held every evening but Sunday for two hours. Daily life was very regimented, classes were held Monday through Friday, as well as Saturday morning, and students had only about two hours to themselves every day. Brother John Driscoll was headmaster for many years and was later replaced by Brother Carroll Posey. On May 26, 1968, SHMA graduated its last class of 35 eighth grade students. About 700 people attended. In the summer of 1968, the school was moved to Indiana. SHMA had only grades 5-8. The Watertown campus is now Maranatha Baptist Bible College.

==LeMans Academy==
With its highest enrollment in years—more than 115 boarding students from across the U.S., Mexico, South Korea, and other nations—Le Mans Academy closed in the spring of 2003 because the Catholic religious order which founded and sponsored the school—the Brothers of Holy Cross, Midwest Province—needed to liquidate an available asset (the academy&#x27;s campus was sold and its endowment claimed) to help meet the rising cost of health care for its aging population of religious Brothers. The first lay Headmaster in the academy&#x27;s history—Mr. Steven Cash—was also the last Headmaster.

The campus was purchased by the Legionaries of Christ to open an apostolic school.

<doc id="1143828" wikidata="Q5249461" url="?curid=1143828" title="Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms">
<text>The Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms was a Resolution adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 6, 1775. Written by Thomas Jefferson and revised by John Dickinson, the Declaration explains why the Thirteen Colonies had taken up arms in what had become the American Revolutionary War.

==Content== 

The Declaration describes what colonists viewed as the effort of the British Parliament to extend its jurisdiction into the colonies following the Seven Years&#x27; War. Objectionable policies listed in the Declaration include taxation without representation, extended use of vice admiralty courts, the several Coercive Acts, and the Declaratory Act. The Declaration describes how the colonists had, for ten years, repeatedly petitioned for the redress of their grievances, only to have their pleas ignored or rejected. Even though British troops have been sent to enforce these unconstitutional acts, the Declaration insists that the colonists do not yet seek independence from the mother country. They have taken up arms &quot;in defense of the Freedom that is our Birthright and which we ever enjoyed until the late Violation of it&quot;, and will &quot;lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors&quot;.

The opening paragraph likens the colonies as being enslaved to the Legislature of Great Britain by violence, against its own constitution, and gives that as the reason for the colonies taking up arms:

==Authorship==
In the 19th century, the authorship of the Declaration was disputed. In a collection of his works first published in 1801, John Dickinson took credit for writing the Declaration. This claim went unchallenged by Thomas Jefferson until many years later when Jefferson was nearly 80 years old. In his autobiography, Jefferson claimed that he wrote the first draft, but Dickinson objected that it was too radical, and so Congress allowed Dickinson to write a more moderate version, keeping only the last four-and-a-half paragraphs of Jefferson&#x27;s draft. Jefferson&#x27;s version of events was accepted by historians for many years. In 1950, Julian P. Boyd, the editor of Jefferson&#x27;s papers, examined the extant drafts and determined that Jefferson&#x27;s memory was faulty and that Dickinson claimed too much credit for the final text.

According to Boyd, an initial draft was reportedly written by John Rutledge, a member of a committee of five appointed to create the Declaration. Rutledge&#x27;s draft was not accepted and does not survive. Jefferson and Dickinson were then added to the committee. Jefferson was appointed to write a draft; how much he drew upon the lost Rutledge draft, if at all, is unknown. Jefferson then apparently submitted his draft to Dickinson, who suggested some changes, which Jefferson, for the most part, decided not to use. The result was that Dickinson rewrote the Declaration, keeping some passages written by Jefferson. Contrary to Jefferson&#x27;s recollection in his old age, Dickinson&#x27;s version was not less radical; according to Boyd, in some respects, Dickinson&#x27;s draft was blunter. The bold statement near the end was written by Dickinson: &quot;Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable.&quot; The disagreement in 1775 between Dickinson and Jefferson appears to have been primarily a matter of style rather than content.

<doc id="1143832" wikidata="Q5153845" url="?curid=1143832" title="Commonwealth Range">
<text>The Commonwealth Range () is a north-south trending range of rugged mountains, long, located within the Queen Maud Mountains on the Dufek Coast of the continent of Antarctica. The range borders the eastern side of Beardmore Glacier from Keltie Glacier to the Ross Ice Shelf.
The range is southeast of the Queen Alexandra Range, which is to the west of the Beardmore Glacier. It is west of the Hughes Range and north of the Supporters Range and the Barton Mountains.

==Discovery and naming==
The range was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09 and named by them after the Commonwealth of Australia, which gave much assistance to the expedition.

==Location==

<text>The Malaysian National News Agency (), is a news agency of the government of Malaysia. It is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Communications. Headquartered at the Wisma Bernama, off Jalan Tun Razak near National Library, Kuala Lumpur, it was created by an Act of Parliament in 1967 and began operating on 20 May 1968.

Its key role is to provide and supplying real-time comprehensive and credible news and accurate information for its clients, both public and media practitioners. Bernama&#x27;s role as a news organization is well known among the local and international media, despite the ever-changing political and media freedom landscape in recent years. Most of the news media in Malaysia and Singapore and international news agencies subscribe to Bernama.

Apart from providing services to its clients using wires, Bernama also provides news broadcasts through its own namesake radio and television channel, which operated 24 hours a day as well as its social media platforms. It also publishes news contents in Chinese, Tamil, Spanish and Arabic besides of news published in Malay and English. Bernama (usually stylized in all caps) is an abbreviation of Berita Nasional Malaysia (&quot;Malaysia National News&quot;); it also means &quot;named&quot; or &quot;titled&quot; in the Malay language.

==History==

===Formation===
Bernama traces its roots to 1959 when the Malay Journalist Association on 30 March have adopted a resolution that urging the Federal Government to set up a news agency that could contribute to the &quot;furtherance of the national interests and of understanding between Malaya and other nations&quot;.

In 1962, the then-Director of Information Services, Mohamed Sopiee felt that the Malayan press &quot;should get together and run a national news agency on a cooperative basis&quot; and insisted that the &quot;news in this country properly collected and sent out to other countries&quot;. On 14 July the same year, the Malayan press and media practitioners decided in principle to create a news agency, which will be a &quot;cooperative, non-profit making and independent organisation&quot; and &quot;promote the free flow of news within the country and true understand of Malaya abroad&quot;. Sadao Roy Otake, the executive news editor of Japanese news agency, Kyodo News Agency fled to Malaya on 26 November to help in forming the national news agency. He said that the formation of the unnamed Malayan news agency as a non-profit organisation raising concern without the interference from the Government and demanded that Malaysia, known as Malaya at that time, needed a news agency to disseminate news to Malayan people and the rest of the world. He also disclosed that the unnamed news agency of Malaya is expected to be launched by August 1963, a month prior to what would have been the formation of Malaysia.

The then-Deputy Prime Minister, Abdul Razak Hussein on 5 August 1965 announced that the Federal Government agreed to set up a news agency as soon as possible, revealing the Bernama name to the public. In November, the then-Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Senu Abdul Rahman announced the establishment of Bernama, and expected to launch in 1966, or in February 1967 in the following three phases:

* Phase 1: Recruiting officers who would operate the agency.
* Phase 2: Carry out smaller tasks to send news to the local newspapers.
* Phase 3: Sending correspondents to certain cities in the world.

A white paper containing a proposal to establish a news agency received approval from the Cabinet in July 1965. D.J. Dallas, an international news specialist from Reuters was sent by UNESCO to investigate each aspects of Bernama&#x27;s establishment thoroughly. The upcoming news agency will be operated in two languages, Malay and English. On 22 December 1966, the establishment of Bernama was approved by the Cabinet. It also revealed that Bernama will incorporate a new system called teleprinter connection system which will &quot;incorporated between its office in Kuala Lumpur and its branch in Sabah and Sarawak&quot;. A bill on Bernama&#x27;s establishment was tabled to the Dewan Rakyat on 19 January 1967; vital changes to the bill were made when Senu move important amendments to Bernama. However, the bill was amended again in which the new amendment replaced the old amendment that distributed before. The new bill ensure Bernama could provide news content with &quot;credible and accurate, without touching public, national interests and community&#x27;s views&quot;. The bill passed on 8 March 1967. Senu said that the formation of Bernama is &quot;not intended to blocked the press freedom&quot;, but instead to &quot;developing news contents even more&quot;. The Dewan Rakyat assured that Bernama will be an &quot;independent, corporate body and not a government news agency&quot;.

Bernama was established under the Act of Parliament on 6 April 1967 and launched a day prior to what would have been 10th anniversary of Malaysia&#x27;s independence, on 30 August 1967 and officiated by the then-Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Abdul Aziz Yeop become its first chairman. In September 1967, Bernama was invited to be the member of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) and officially became a full member a year later, in September 1968. A month later, Bernama is looking for three top executive posts to fill the position.

===Beginning of operations===
On 9 April 1968, Bernama announced that it would start operations by 1 May, but it officially commenced its operations on 20 May. At the time it began operations, Bernama has only 20 staffs with its headquarters located at the four-room bungalow at Jalan Pekeliling, Kuala Lumpur. In its inaugural meeting on 30 July, the then-Secretary to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Junid Abd Rahim said that the Government will spend RM500,000 for Bernama, which was part of the RM1.5 million launching grant to Bernama.

In June 1968, Bernama received 9 subscribers to its news service. In December the same year, it sought assistance from the Thomson Foundation for its expansion programme.

In 1971, Bernama partnered with Indonesian news agency, Antara for news partnership. In 1972, Bernama planned to take control on foreign news while it was in talks for sole distribution rights in Malaysia with four international news agencies, including Reuters and Associated Press.

In 1978, Bernama planned to introduce a photo service by 1979 and a radio teletype service by 1981. These services were meant for overseas transmissions purposes. In 1979, Bernama proposed its plan to open its office in Manila, Philippines before the year-end. It would be the news agency&#x27;s first regional office outside of Malaysia.

In 1981, Bernama was selected as a host for the four-day Asean news agencies conferences which expected to held in October, which took place officially from 2 to 5 November and attended by 23 international news agencies.

In September 1982, Bernama partnered with Kyodo News Agency to launch a 24-hour communications link for better news exchange between the two agencies. Days later, Bernama opened its bureau in Singapore and managed by two Bernama officials.

In July 1983, the Government decided to turn Bernama as a sole distributor of foreign news from international news outlets. Editors and publishers in the country have been consulted to Bernama following the move. A month later, it was reported that Bernama would likely to sold to private investors. Information Minister at that time, Adib Adam clarified that the privatisation of Bernama could run on a &quot;profit-oriented basis&quot;. In September that year, Bernama steps into foreign news distribution plan, inline with the government&#x27;s decision to channel foreign news to Malaysian newspapers via its platform, albeit received objection from newspaper editors. It also took the responsibility to provide a teletext service that could help to generate its income.

In January 1984, Bernama signed an agreement with the German news agency, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) to enter a commercial arrangement for the distribution of the latter&#x27;s service. In February, the news agency announced that it will introduce an AP-Telerate financial information service.

On 16 March, Bernama signed an agreement with the United Press International (UPI) for the distribution of the latter&#x27;s news and picture services in Malaysia by Bernama. Starting on 1 May 1984, Bernama will transform as a standalone news distributor from all international news agencies operated in Malaysia. At the same time, it moved its new headquarters from MCOBA Building, Jalan Syed Putra to Jalan Tun Razak.

The service made available in Malay and English and targeted to hotels, banks and other business premises. Days later, the then-Information Minister, Rais Yatim announced that Bernama would likely to be privatised.

In September 1985, Rais confirmed that the agency will be corporatised into a private entity, pending approval from the Government, citing that it is &quot;being studied&quot;, including the review of the Bernama Act. The plan was later abandoned.

In 1986, Bernama began supplying news materials, articles and information on current development to Malaysian diasporas. The cost of sending news contents to Malaysian diasporas would be bore by the Government. It also signed an agreement with Sime Darby&#x27;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sime Darby Systems to create a nationwide voice grade communications network which covers all major towns in Malaysia.

The Government in September 1987 have considered the idea to amend the Bernama Act in which Bernama would likely to be &quot;profit-oriented&quot; organisation rather than a non-profit organisation and allowed the agency to operated commercially. In October that year, Bernama set up an online real-time information database, known as Bernama Livecom. The service aims to provide packaged business information to all business premises.

On 13 April 1988, Bernama partnered with the Turkish news agency, Anadolu News Agency as part of its expansion of the international news exchange network.

In December, Bernama secured RM16.5 loan from two banks, one of them is Permata Chartered Merchant Bank, to recover the existing loan for its headquarters in Jalan Tun Razak.

In 1989, Bernama began to increased its presence in the electronic media marketplace by launching Bernama Monitor and Newscan II, awhile at the same time, it acquires 400 personal computers for both services.

On 27 February 1990, the Government tabled a bill at the Dewan Rakyat to grant Bernama a specific rights to determine the types of news materials from international news agencies which it &quot;considered suitable for local publications&quot;. Ahead of the privatisation of Bernama, the then-Information Minister, Mohamed Rahmat said that the proposed privatisation will only involves certain aspects of its operations.

In June the same year, the amendment of the 1967 Bernama Act was tabled again in Parliament. The amendment was &quot;not intended to restrict, control or abuse press freedom in the country&quot;. A day later, Bernama was given sole rights to receive and distribute news in the country and allowed to ventured into business to ensure it is self-financed after the Parliament passed amendments of the act.

In January 1991, Bernama partnered with Hongkong Bank to launch a daily facsimile news service, known as Bernama-Hongkong Bank Five O&#x27;Clock Digest.

He also pointed out that the agency &quot;will still have to discharged its social obligations in news coverage&quot; when Bernama become a corporate entity upon its privatisation.

<text>Samira Bellil (24 November 1972 – 4 September 2004) was a French feminist activist and a campaigner for the rights of girls and women.

Bellil became famous in France with the publication of her autobiographical book &quot;Dans l&#x27;enfer des tournantes&quot; (&#x27;In the hell of the &quot;tournantes&quot; (gang-rapes) in 2002. The book discusses the violence she and other young women endured in the predominantly North African and Arab immigrant outskirts of Paris, where she was repeatedly gang-raped as a teenager by gangs led by people she knew, and then abandoned by her family and friends.

The book is available in English (translated by Lucy R. McNair) as &quot;To Hell and Back: The Life of Samira Bellil&quot;.

== Life ==

Bellil was born to Algerian parents in Algiers. Her family migrated to France and settled in the Parisian suburb of Val-d&#x27;Oise. Her father was jailed almost immediately for murder and she was fostered by a family in Belgium for five years, before being called back to her parents.

As a teenager Bellil rebelled against the traditional constraints of her community and wanted to live freely as a young French woman.

Samira was gang-raped when she was 14 by a gang led by someone she knew. They beat her and raped her all night. A month later, one of the most violent attackers dragged her off a train by her hair while other passengers looked the other way. She was brutally raped by him again.

She did not report her rapes until two friends told her the same gang had sexually assaulted them too. Samira appealed to the French legal system to prosecute her attackers. The ring leader was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Bellil&#x27;s parents, who believed themselves shamed by her presence, expelled her from her house as she did not practice &#x27;modesty&#x27; and chose not to veil herself with a hijab. &quot;People outside the community don&#x27;t know,&quot; Bellil wrote, &quot;and everyone in the community knows, but they won&#x27;t say anything.&quot;

Eventually, she found a psychologist who helped her. She had years of therapy, and describes how she decided to write her book to show other young women gang-rape victims that there was a way out. &quot;It&#x27;s long and it&#x27;s difficult, but it&#x27;s possible,&quot; she wrote in the dedication - to &quot;my sisters in trouble&quot;. She used her real name and put her photo on the cover. She dedicated the book to her &quot;girlfriends, so that they realize that one can overcome the traumatic&quot; and to Boris Cyrulnik, her therapist. Her experience shocked France and forced the government to look into the issue.

She became a youth worker. She died aged 31 on 4 September 2004 of stomach cancer.

==&quot;Ni Putes Ni Soumises&quot; ==
Bellil helped found a young women&#x27;s activist group called Ni Putes Ni Soumises (&quot;Neither whores nor submissives&quot;) which has publicly addressed the issue of violence against young women in France. The group drew the attention of the French and European press as they organized marches and press conferences to bring attention to the tragic events happening to young women in the banlieue of France. She denounced the gang-rapes (known as &quot;tournantes&quot;, or &quot;pass-arounds&quot;) and described how she overcame both her traumatic experiences and the need for revenge.

==Legacy==
She was chosen as one of the new Mariannes, the new faces of France. Her portrait hangs outside the French National Assembly.

In 2005 a French school in l’Île-Saint-Denis was named in her honor: Ecole Samira Bellil.

<text>Alain Chamfort (; born Alain Joseph Yves Le Govic; 2 March 1949) is a French singer of Breton origin.

== Life and career ==
Chamfort was a promising pianist in his youth, and the piano became his instrument of choice. His first band The Dreamers had minor success as a repertory jazz outfit, and was followed by a typically sixties rock music group Murator.

Chamfort met famed writer and producer Jacques Dutronc, who proposed to help him with future works for television and film, and it is with Dutronc that Chamfort&#x27;s career expanded. After being discovered by Dutronc, it was with Claude François and ultimately Serge Gainsbourg that he made a number of albums, including his first album recorded as Alain Chamfort: &quot;. A single from the album, &quot; remains one of the most famous songs to date by Chamfort, whose subject is the yacht &quot;Manureva&quot; which disappeared with her skipper Alain Colas in 1978.

Chamfort composed for the cinema; he worked with Jean-Pierre Mocky and with Arnaud Sélignac. As an actor, he appeared in the short &quot;Men/Toys/Girl&quot; in 2001. In 2004, he became a member of the board of directors of SACEM.

<text>Wasserburg am Inn (Central Bavarian: &quot;Wassabuag am Inn&quot;) is a town in Rosenheim district in Upper Bavaria, Germany. The historic centre is a peninsula formed by the meandering river Inn. Many Medieval structures remain intact, giving the city a unique view.

== Villages ==
Wasserburg consists of 22 &quot;Ortsteile&quot;:

* Attel
* Attlerau 
* Au 
* Edgarten 
* Elend 
* Gabersee 
* Gern 
* Heberthal 
* Kobl 
* Kornberg 
* Kroit 
* Langwiederberg 
* Limburg 
* Osterwies 
* Reisach 
* Reitmehring  
* Rottmoos 
* Seewies 
* Staudham 
* Viehhausen
* Wasserburg am Inn (main part/center) 
* Weikertsham

==History==
The town was first mentioned in a document (now considered to be a fake) in 1137, when Hallgraf Engelbert moved his residence from the nearby castle Limburg to his &quot;Wasserburg&quot; (Water Castle).
It is one of the most historic towns of Old Bavaria – somewhat older than Munich, continually fought over by the Bavarian nobility and, up to the 16th century, on an equal footing with larger cities. The privileges afforded by this enabled the salt trade to flourish right into the 19th century. At the junction of the main overland route with the main water route, Wasserburg became the most important trade centre with the Balkans, Austria and Italy, a means of attaining power and wealth for the shipping owners and merchants.

In the early days, Wasserburg was an important hub in the salt trade. Its bridge was the only possibility to cross the river Inn for 30 km in both directions. On its shore the salt, mined in Berchtesgaden or produced in the Saline (saltern) at Bad Reichenhall and shipped from there by cart, could be loaded on ships travelling on the Inn River. Up to the 17th century Wasserburg was used as the port of the capital Munich.

Up until 1972, when it was merged with the district Rosenheim, Wasserburg was a district capital on its own.

==In literature==
Gustav Meyrink&#x27;s most esoteric novel &quot;The White Dominican&quot; () is set in a mystical version of the town of Wasserburg.

<text>Auber Octavius Neville (20 November 1875 – 18 April 1954) was a British-Australian public servant who served as the Chief Protector of Aborigines and Commissioner of Native Affairs in Western Australia, a total term from 1915 to 1940 and his retirement from government. 

Neville was a supporter of eugenics. He believed that Aboriginal Australians needed to be assimilated and could eventually be absorbed into the larger European population through mixed marriages. As Chief Protector and Commissioner, he helped shape Western Australia&#x27;s policy towards Aboriginal Australians. Since the late twentieth century, Neville has become an infamous historical figure in Australia for his role in creating the Stolen Generations and conducting a genocide of Indigenous Australians. He was portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the film &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; (2002), which explored this period.

==Early life==
Auber Octavius Neville was born on 20 November 1875 in Ford, Northumberland, United Kingdom. After living for ten years in Victoria, British Columbia with his parents, Neville moved as a young man in 1897 to Western Australia, where his brother was practising law.

==Career==

After arriving in Western Australia, Neville joined the Department of Works as a records clerk; he quickly rose through the ranks due to his efficiency. In 1900, he was appointed registrar of a sub-department of Premier John Forrest&#x27;s office. In 1902, he was promoted to registrar of the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s Department.

In 1906, Neville became an immigration officer. In 1910 he was appointed as the secretary of a new department organising immigration and tourism. He assisted in fostering the migration of 40,000 British people to Western Australia between 1910 and 1914. Following the outbreak of World War I, he was appointed as secretary of the War Patriotic Fund.

=== Chief Protector of Aborigines ===
On 25 March 1915, Neville was the state&#x27;s second appointee to the role of the Chief Protector of Aborigines, although he had no experience in that area. 

Neville worked from Murray Street, Perth and had under him a secretary and either five or six clerks. He had only one travelling inspector, E.C. Mitchell, from 1925 to 1930. That year he had to sack Mitchell due to the Great Depression. His administration had a budget of one pound and nine shillings per Indigenous Australian.

During the next quarter-century, Neville presided over the controversial policy of removing Aboriginal children from their families, especially if they were of mixed race, for education and assimilation to mainstream Australian life. Such children came to be called the Stolen Generations.

Early on as Chief Protector, Neville took control of the mission at Carrolup and expanded it to be self-reliant. In 1918, a mission opened at Moore River. In northern Western Australia, Neville wanted to take control of missions and transform them into self-reliant cattle stations with Moola Bulla in the Kimberley as his model. Neville believed this was a way to save government money, but it would also give Aboriginal residents on the missions work to do. Neville is quoted as saying that &quot;scores of the children are growing up without any prospect of a future before them, being alienated from their old bush life, and rendered more or less useless for the condition of life being forced upon them&quot;.

Neville acquired the former pastoral stations of Munja in 1926 and Violet Valley in 1935, with the purpose of establishing them as stations to &quot;pacify the natives and accustom them to white man&#x27;s ways and thus enable further settlement&quot;. Despite this, no other missions were established in the north during Neville&#x27;s time in office. Some Aboriginal Australians were forcibly forced onto missions, with at least 500 Aboriginal people (around a quarter of the native population in southern Western Australia) being removed to missions from 1915 to 1920. At age 14, children of mixed descent were sent out from missions to work. A high proportion of the girls returned pregnant. Neville was annoyed at the burden this placed on the government to support their babies, but did not feel that this was an important issue.

By the 1930s, Neville refined his beliefs of integrating Indigenous Australians into white culture. The practice of removing mixed-race Aboriginal/European children from their families was advocated at the time as part of a plan to &quot;breed out the colour&quot; by having those children brought up as though they were white. The idea was that over successive generations, they would marry people of increasingly European descent, until there would be no Aboriginal people in Australia at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-29/brutal-legacy-of-sister-kate-indigenous-childrens-home/10034434?user_id=ec9bb1c337823f5a0528373e6cf90&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many whites believed that &quot;full-blooded&quot; Aboriginal people were dying out.

Non-Indigenous people in Western Australia expressed mixed feelings towards Neville&#x27;s policies of miscegenation.
=== Commissioner of Native Affairs ===
In 1934, the WA government set up the Moseley Royal Commission to examine the state of Aboriginal people with regard to the role of Chief Protector. The result was that the Chief Protector was given more authority over the lives of Western Australian Aboriginal people which, some say, only increased their suffering.

In 1936, Neville was appointed as the Commissioner for Native Affairs, a post he held until his retirement in 1940.

Neville represented WA at the Conference of Commonwealth and State Aboriginal Authorities held in Canberra from April 21 to 23, 1937. As a result, several of Neville&#x27;s policies of absorption and assimilation were adopted nationwide; the first resolution passed by the conference stated that &quot;the destiny of the natives of aboriginal origin, but not of the full blood, lies in their ultimate absorption by the people of the Commonwealth, and it therefore recommends that all efforts be directed to that end&quot;. 

Neville was one of the most influential delegates at the conference, and declared:
Are we going to have one million blacks in the Commonwealth or are we going to merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there were any Aborigines in Australia?Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to &#x27;uplifting the Native race.&#x27; Speaking at the Moseley Royal Commission, he defended the policies of forced settlement, removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that:
&quot;[T]hey have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon&#x27;s knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patient&#x27;s will.&quot;

Neville stated that children had not been removed indiscriminately, saying that:
&quot;[T]he children who have been removed as wards of the Chief Protector have been removed because I desired to be satisfied that the conditions surrounding their upbringing were satisfactory, which they certainly were not.&quot;Policies adopted by the conference ended with the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1940, Neville retired from his role as Commissioner after reaching the retirement age of 65. He was succeeded by Francis Bray.
=== Retirement ===
In 1947, Neville published &quot;Australia&#x27;s Coloured Minority&quot;, a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of Aboriginal people into non-Aboriginal Australia. The book defends his policy but also acknowledges that Aboriginal people had been harmed by European intervention. 

For that reason, he said, more had to be done to assist them:
&quot;I make no apologies for writing the book, because there are things which need to be said. So few of our own people as a whole are aware of the position [of Aborigines]. Yet we have had the coloured man amongst us for a hundred years or more. He has died in his hundreds, nay thousands, in pain, misery and squalor, and through avoidable ill-health. Innumerable little children have perished through neglect and ignorance. The position, in some vital respects, is not much better today than it was fifty years ago. Man is entitled to a measure of happiness in his life. Yet most of these people have never known real happiness. Some are never likely to know it. The causes of their condition are many. Mainly it is not their fault, it is ours, just as it lies with us to put the matter right.&quot;

In 1947, following his retirement, he was invited to represent the State of Western Australia on discussions regarding Aboriginal Welfare in connection with the Woomera Test Range, prior to its establishment.

== Personal life ==
In London on 1 June 1910, Neville married Maryan Florence Low. Together, they had five children - three daughters and two sons.

Neville was an Anglican like his father, participating in the church as a lay-reader and chorister.

Neville was a notable resident of Darlington. He was a regular user of the Eastern Railway which closed a few months before his death. He died in Perth on 18 April 1954, survived by his wife and two of his children. He was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

== Representation in other media ==
In the late twentieth century, Australian policies came under examination, including Neville&#x27;s policy of assimilation. Jack Davis wrote a play, &quot;No Sugar&quot; (1985), exploring Neville&#x27;s policy.

Neville was also featured as the public face of assimilation policy in the 2002 film &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; (in which he was played by Kenneth Branagh).

<doc id="1143902" wikidata="Q7850445" url="?curid=1143902" title="Kostya Tszyu vs. Sharmba Mitchell II">
<text>[[Kostya Tszyu]] vs. [[Sharmba Mitchell]] II, billed as Unfinished Business, was a professional boxing match which took place on November 6, 2004 at the Glendale Arena, Glendale, Arizona.

==Background==
Tszyu and Mitchell met for the first time on November 2, 2002, with Tszyu as the WBC world champion and Mitchell as the WBA world champion. They fought to unify those belts. The first fight was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The fight was fought at close quarters with use of rough tactics by both boxers. Tszyu pushed Mitchell to the canvas four times. Whether the pushes were accidental or not was never known, but Mitchell injured his knee and declared himself unable to fight on after the seventh round, giving Tszyu an unlikely type of knockout.

One of the reasons that both Tszyu and Mitchell felt a rematch, apart from the fact that Mitchell claimed for three years after their first encounter that he was on his way to a win, was necessary was that most boxing magazine writers and fans alike felt that the first fight&#x27;s result was inconclusive. Likewise, fans were split as to whom was winning the first fight between the co-champions: while Tszyu fans generally had him ahead, Mitchell fans felt Mitchell was winning it until the point when he could go on no longer.

Tszyu defeated Ben Tackie next, in February 2003, by a twelve-round unanimous decision, to retain the unified belts. During February 10, 2003, the managing team of Canadian boxer Arturo Gatti announced they had begun negotiations for a Tszyu-Gatti match-up (that fight failed to materialize).

Initially to be fought in late 2003 in Sydney, Australia, the Tszyu-Mitchell rematch had to be postponed because Tszyu injured two tendons during training.

It was then rescheduled for the summer of 2004, in Moscow, Russia however Tszyu got injured again, forcing a second postponement. These two injuries caused Tszyu to be inactive for a total of twenty-two months. In addition, the fact that Mitchell&#x27;s knee had also naturally become weaker after his own injury made many fans question the ability of both fighters to put on a good show in their rematch.

The IBF named Mitchell their &quot;interim champion&quot;. After further negotiations, it was agreed the fight should be held in Glendale, Arizona. The fight&#x27;s referee was Raul Caiz, Sr..

===Celebrities===
Sylvester Stallone attended the fight, as well as former world Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and Jr. Welterweight contender and interim WBA Jr. Welterweight champion Vivian Harris.

===Flag incidents===
Just before the boxers entered the ring for the main event, two fans brought out two Russian flags. They lit one, burning it. A second one would have been burned; security promptly arrived and removed the fans from the arena, but not before they threw the second flag for other fans to get it. These other fans proceeded to stomp on the flag. The reasons for protesting using a Russian flag during the Tszyu fight are not totally clear: though Tszyu is Russian by birth, he had long since renounced his Russian citizenship; Australia was Tszyu&#x27;s new homeland.

==The fight==
Both fighters rushed out of their corners for round one. Tszyu was somewhat slower; he might have been trying to shake off some rust after not fighting for the aforementioned twenty-two months. Mitchell landed some heavy rights to Tszyu&#x27;s chin, while the champion looked calm and composed. Mitchell outlanded Tszyu in this round. An important point of the fight was when both boxers clashed their heads before round one was finished, and Tszyu came out with a cut around his nose.

Perhaps afraid that the fight would be stopped because of the cut and declared a technical draw, Tszyu came out of his corner for round two with a sense of urgency. Midway towards the round, he landed a right to Mitchell&#x27;s chin that staggered the former world champion. Mitchell then retreated to the ropes, near his own corner. Tszyu followed with a flurry of punches, and Mitchell fell from an uppercut. He fell near the ropes, almost the same way that Sugar Ray Leonard had dropped Thomas Hearns in round thirteen of their 1981 fight.

Mitchell, visibly awakened, got up and continued fighting. Towards the end of the round, he landed a right to Tszyu&#x27;s chin that made Tszyu&#x27;s head snap back.

Soon after round three began, Tszyu connected with a right hand to the chin that sent Mitchell to the canvas for the second time; he landed on a sitting position. Mitchell again rose, but Tszyu stayed over him, driving him to the ropes and landing blows to Mitchell&#x27;s body before Mitchell suffered his second knockdown of the round and third of the fight.

Once again, Mitchell rose, but he was trapped against the ropes. After another quick combination of blows to the body, Mitchell fell again, and referee Cadiz, Sr. proceeded to stop the fight. This was the fourth and final knockdown in the fight for Mitchell, as well as the third knockdown in round three.

==Aftermath==
This turned out to be the last win in Tszyu&#x27;s illustrious career.

==Undercard==
The fight&#x27;s undercard featured former world champions Yori Boy Campas and Joan Guzmán.

Confirmed bouts:

==Broadcasting==
The bout was televised in the United States by Showtime, while, in Australia and Europe, it was shown on Pay Per View.

<text>Pacific Ocean Park was a nautical-themed amusement park built on a pier at Pier Avenue in the Ocean Park section of Santa Monica, California in 1958. Intended to compete with Disneyland, it replaced Ocean Park Pier (1926–1956). After it closed and fell into disrepair, the park and pier anchored the Dogtown area of Santa Monica.

==History==

Pacific Ocean Park was a joint venture between CBS and Santa Anita Park. It opened on Saturday, July 28, 1958, with an attendance of 20,000. The next day, it drew 37,262, outperforming Disneyland&#x27;s attendance that day. Admission was 90 cents for adults, which included access to the park and certain exhibits. It was locally known by the acronym POP (&quot;pee-oh-pee&quot;). It was also marketed as &quot;Pay One Price&quot;, though other rides and attractions were on a pay-per-use basis.

Like Disneyland, it found corporate sponsors to share the expense of some exhibits. Six of the pier&#x27;s original attractions were incorporated into the new park, including the Sea Serpent roller coaster, the antique Looff carousel, the Toonerville Fun House, the Glass House and the twin diving bells.

==Attractions==
Among a standard complement of carnival-style attractions and rides were:
*Westinghouse Enchanted Forest/ Submarine Exhibit featuring a -long model of the atomic reactor section of a submarine
*House of Tomorrow, themed like similar &quot;looks at the future&quot; at Disneyland&#x27;s Tomorrowland and the World&#x27;s Fair. Elektro, the talking and smoking robot from the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, was a prominent display.
*Sea Circus was included in the basic entrance price. Performing dolphins and sea lions played to audiences of 2,000. After shows, visitors could feed seals in the Seal Pool.

*Diving Bells, where passengers were submerged underwater in dual diving bells operated via hydraulic pistons. An underwater view of the tank was visible through the portholes. (Similar rides also existed in single fashion at the Long Beach Nu-Pike and Coney Island&#x27;s Astroland.) The ride&#x27;s thrill occurred when the bell was allowed to surface. When the hydraulic pressure holding the bell down was released, they shot back up to the surface in dramatic fashion. The ride was manufactured by Martine.

*Ocean Skyway, built by Von Roll, consisted of bubble-shaped gondolas suspended 75 feet (23 m) above the surface of the ocean. Passengers were treated to a half-mile (800 m) trip out to sea and back.
*Union 76 Ocean Highway, similar to Disneyland&#x27;s Autopia attraction, where visitors drove miniature gasoline-powered automobiles on a simulated highway.
*Flight to Mars, an audiovisual presentation that simulated a trip to Mars
*Flying Carpet, a ride themed around the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; folk tales. &quot;Flying carpets&quot; suspended on an overhead track took visitors over an Arabian-themed diorama.
*Mirror Maze, a standard funhouse attraction.
*Davy Jones&#x27; Locker, another funhouse with a nautical theme

*Flying Dutchman, a dark ride similar in theme to Disneyland&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean, but without animatronic figures
*Deepest Deep, a simulated submarine voyage. Unlike Disneyland&#x27;s Submarine Voyage attraction, Deepest Deep took place above water.
*Round the World in 80 Turns was an unusual combination of travelogue and thrill ride. Tub-like ride vehicles whipped sharply to the right and left to show travel scenes from around the world. The attraction was closed during the middle of the park&#x27;s second season following customer complaints of nausea and neck and back pain.
*Safari Dark Ride was an interactive children&#x27;s ride where riders in miniature Jeeps used an electronic rifle to &quot;hunt&quot; animals in the African jungle.
*Mystery Island Banana Train Ride was considered by many the park&#x27;s best ride. Passengers took a trip aboard a tropical banana plantation train, complete with a simulated volcano and simulated earthquakes.
*Sea Serpent Roller Coaster, the wooden 1926 Hi-Boy rollercoaster from the original pier.

*Mahi Mahi, a massive Stantzel Strat-O-Liner tower with rotating arms ending in jet-style cars, each of which held eight passengers. Six of these rides were manufactured, but none exist today.
*Whirl Pool, a centrifuge that pinned riders to its walls as the floor slowly lowered beneath them.
*Mr. Dolphin, another original pier attraction
*Flying Fish, a miniature rollercoaster made by Carlos and Ramigosi, the first steel Wild Mouse roller coaster in the U.S.

*Carousel, the 1926-vintage Looff carousel from the original pier
*Fisherman&#x27;s Cove and the International Promenade, shopping, dining and souvenir areas with a number of international restaurants
*King Neptune&#x27;s Courtyard, a colorful walk under the ocean to view King Neptune&#x27;s lair
*Mrs. Squid, also known as the Ahuna Thrill Ride, an Eyerly Octopus ride with a squid decor in the center and 16 tubs, each carrying two passengers
*Mr. Octopus, a standard Eyerly Octopus ride with eight tubs
*Space Wheels, a unique pair of double Ferris wheels manufactured by Velare Brothers. The attraction still exists and is owned by Drew Exposition of Georgia.
*Fun Forest, a children&#x27;s area with mazes and slides as well as helicopter, boat, monorail and covered-wagon rides
By January 5, 1959, POP had attracted 1,190,000 visitors. Although plans were made to add four new attractions, only two were completed, at a cost of $2,000,000: Space Wheels and Fun Forest.

==Film location==
The park was used as a filming location for television shows such as &quot;Route 66 (TV series)&quot; (&quot;Between Hello and Goodbye&quot;, 1962), &quot;The Millionaire&quot; (&quot;The Jeff Mercer Story&quot;, 1959), &quot;The Fugitive, Get Smart&quot; (1968), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot; (1968), &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, and films such as &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950), &quot;Vicki&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; (1962).&quot;

The Miss Teen USA beauty pageant was held at the park in 1962, with the winner, Linda Henning, 15, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota crowned by television comedian Soupy Sales.

==Decline==

In 1965, Santa Monica began the Ocean Park urban renewal project. Buildings in the surrounding area were demolished and streets leading to the park were closed. As a result, visitors found it difficult to reach the park, and attendance plummeted to 621,000 in 1965 and 398,700 in 1966.

At the end of the 1967 tourist season, the park&#x27;s creditors and the City of Santa Monica filed suit to take control of the property because of back taxes and back rent owed by the park&#x27;s new owner since 1965. The park closed on October 6, 1967, and its assets were auctioned off from June 28–30, 1968. The proceeds from the sale of 36 rides and 16 games were used to pay off creditors. The ruins of the pier became a favorite surfing area and hangout of the Z-Boys of Dogtown fame. The park&#x27;s dilapidated buildings and pier structure remained until several suspicious fires occurred on:

* May 27, 1970
* August 29, 1971

* March 17, 1973

Pacific Ocean Park was finally demolished starting in October 1974 and ending in February 1975. Other than a few underwater pilings and signs warning of them, nothing remains of Pacific Ocean Park today. A few miles north, the original Santa Monica Pier features a newer amusement park, similarly called Pacific Park.

<doc id="1143918" wikidata="Q7917303" url="?curid=1143918" title="Vaughan Mills">
<text>Vaughan Mills is a regional outlet mall located at the southeast quadrant of the Highway 400 and Rutherford Road interchange in Vaughan, Ontario, just south of Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. It is one of the largest enclosed shopping centres in Canada, and the largest shopping mall in York Region with almost of retail space. The complex has over 200 retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment outlets.

The mall is served by York Region Transit bus routes at the Vaughan Mills Terminal, with frequent service to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre subway station, the northern terminus of Line 1 Yonge-University of the Toronto subway, to the south along Jane Street.

==History==

The shopping centre was designed and built by Ivanhoé Cambridge and Mills Corporation, the latter of which owned a portfolio of malls across the United States. JPRA served as the design architect for the centre, with Bregman + Hamann Architects as the project architect. Like its American counterparts, Vaughan Mills incorporates a &quot;race track&quot; layout to maximize the exposure of the mall tenants. When Vaughan Mills was conceived in 1999, it was meant to be a slightly larger complex at 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m²), with up to 18 anchor retailers and a combined 245 stores and services.

The shopping centre was intended to be a stepping stone for American retailers who wanted to enter the Canadian market, however Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World was the only U.S. retailer to make its exclusive launch there, while other anticipated retailers such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Burlington Coat Factory never opened at Vaughan Mills. In September 1999, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Sun &amp; Ski Sports were among the six American retailers that were announced as Vaughan Mills&#x27; first anchor tenants. An ESPN X Games Skatepark was also planned as the main entertainment venue site.

Construction of the mall began in June 2003. It opened on November 4, 2004, and was the first regional enclosed shopping complex to be opened in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) since the Erin Mills Town Centre in 1990 as well as the first in the GTA built in the 21st century. The mall had its two-millionth visitor less than two months after its opening. Vaughan Mills receives over 13.5 million patrons per year. In August 2006, the Mills Corporation sold its stake in Vaughan Mills to partner Ivanhoé Cambridge.

In January 2013, plans were announced for an expansion of 150,000 square feet and 50 new stores to the mall, which opened in late 2014. On March 17, 2016, Saks Off 5th opened a store in the mall.

StyleSense and NASCAR Speedpark were closed in early 2012. They have been replaced by Calvin Klein and Legoland Discovery Centre.

In 2018, Japanese retailer Uniqlo announced an expansion to open four new locations in malls, including Vaughan Mills, which opened on September 28, 2018, in the former HR2 location (which had opened in 2013).

==Name==
The mall was named following a trend by one of the real estate companies involved, The Mills Corporation, who named their &quot;Landmark&quot; mall developments ending in &quot;Mills&quot;, hence &quot;Vaughan Mills&quot; was used for the mall name.

The local origins of the name &quot;Vaughan Mills&quot; can be traced back to the location of a saw mill built near a farm on the main branch of the Humber River on Lot 12, Concession 8 in the 1830&#x27;s, up the river from Woodbridge. A grist mill was later added to the site. This area was known as &quot;Vaughan Mills&quot; in historical maps and was located around where the present-day Vaughan Mills Road crosses the Humber River in the west end of the city, a notable distance away from the today&#x27;s shopping mall complex. The farm and surrounding lands were redeveloped into residential housing in the 1990&#x27;s.


==Public transit==
The Vaughan Mills Terminal is a York Region Transit (YRT) transit terminal located at 1 Bass Pro Mills Drive, near the northeast corridor of Vaughan Mills near the intersection of Rutherford Road and Jane Street. The terminal has &quot;&quot; ticket machines. Only YRT routes connect to this terminal.

==Sister malls in Canada==

Ivanhoé Cambridge stated in 2011 that their strategic plan was to have four sister malls in Canada, with Vaughan Mills as the first, and additional locations to be located near Calgary, Vancouver and Montreal.

CrossIron Mills, located outside of Calgary, Alberta, opened on August 19, 2009. It has a number of the same retailers as the Vaughan Mills Mall, including Bass Pro Shops. The CrossIron Mills location opened in the spring of 2009, several months ahead of the main mall. The construction, leasing, and opening of the mall has paralleled Vaughan Mills to a degree, as it, too, has occurred during an economic recession.

Tsawwassen Mills, located in Delta, British Columbia, at Highway 17 and 52nd Street on Tsawwassen First Nation Lands south of Vancouver. Construction began in January 2014 and the mall opened on October 5, 2016. Tsawwassen Mills is designed in a similar format to its sister malls and includes approximately of retail. Plans call for 16 anchor retailers, including the first Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World location in British Columbia announced as the first anchor tenant.

Ivanhoé Cambridge had originally planned to build what would have been called Laval Mills in Laval, Quebec near Montreal, at the intersection of Quebec Autoroute 440 and Quebec Autoroute 25. However, after three years of planning and analysis, these plans were abandoned in May 2011 citing that their criteria of feasibility and profitability were not met, partly because environmental issues as construction would have disrupted a number of wetlands on or directly connection to the project. At the time the project was cancelled Ivanhoé Cambridge stated they would continue plans for a Mills mall to be built in the Montreal region.

<text>Honolulu University of the Arts, Sciences, and Humanities, or just Honolulu University, is an unaccredited institution of nontraditional higher education (distance learning).

==History==
The institution was founded by Warren Walker as Golden State University in California, United States, and later moved to Hawaii, where it was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in February 1987.

==Accreditation and affiliation==
The institution is affiliated with the International Management Association of Hong Kong, which also identifies American City University as an affiliate.

It has been alleged that until 2005 Honolulu University was a full institutional member of the International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE), which is not an accreditation body. In its advertising Honolulu University at one time claimed accreditation by &quot;Akademie für Internationale Kultur- und Wissenschaftsförderung&quot;, which was not a generally recognized accrediting body in Europe and apparently also is defunct or dormant, although still registered as a non-profit association with the district court of Duisburg, Germany, under the number 51324.

==Events==
The institution received media attention because of lawsuits resulting from irregularities related to school agents in Asia who failed to properly disclose the unaccredited status of the school to prospective students. The school lost in court and the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection was at one time processing requests for tuition refunds. Honolulu University in turn sued their Singaporean agent, who in the meantime had died.

<text>Syreeta Wright (February 28, 1946 – July 6, 2004), known mononymously as Syreeta, was an American singer-songwriter, best known for her music during the early 1970s through the early 1980s. Wright&#x27;s career heights were songs in collaboration with her ex-husband Stevie Wonder and musical artist Billy Preston.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Wright, who was of African American heritage, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1946, and started singing at the age of four. Her father, Lordian Wright, served in the Korean War and Syreeta and her sister Kim were raised by their mother Essie and their grandmother. The Wrights moved back and forth from Detroit to South Carolina, before finally settling in Detroit just as Wright entered high school. Money problems kept Wright from pursuing a career in ballet, so she focused her attention on a music career joining several singing groups, before landing a job as a receptionist for Motown in 1965. Within a year, she became a secretary for Mickey Stevenson, just as Martha Reeves had done before her.

A year later, Edward Holland of the Holland–Dozier–Holland songwriting team noticed Wright&#x27;s singing and decided to try her out for demos of Supremes&#x27; songs. However, in those days, the team of composers Ashford and Simpson had joined Motown and their songs were initially supervised by established producers. Edward&#x27;s brother, composer and producer Brian Holland, co-wrote &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give Back the Song I Feel for You&quot; with the couple, and produced it with Lamont Dozier for Syreeta. Brian felt Syreeta was a hard name to pronounce, and that Rita Wright would make a good stage name, so Wright&#x27;s first solo single was released in January 1968 under that name, with &quot;Something On My Mind&quot; on the flip side. It is often said that the song was initially written for the Supremes (by then billed as &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;), but Motown session logs indicate that the backing track was not recorded for anyone else previously. Later, Diana Ross re-recorded the song for her solo album, &quot;Surrender&quot;, released in 1971.

Wright also performed demo vocals for the Supremes hit &quot;Love Child&quot; and for Ross&#x27; version of &quot;Something On My Mind&quot;, released on her self-titled debut album. When Diana Ross left the Supremes in early 1970, Motown boss Berry Gordy considered replacing her with Wright, but offered the place in the group to Jean Terrell. According to several sources, Gordy then changed his mind and tried to replace Terrell with Wright, but this was vetoed by member Mary Wilson since Terrell had already been formally announced as the new lead singer in the media and at the final performance of the Ross-led incarnation of the group.

Wright also sang background on records by the Supremes and by Martha and the Vandellas, notably singing the chorus to the group&#x27;s modest hit single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance to That Music You&#x27;re Playing&quot;. Wright met labelmate Stevie Wonder in 1968, and the two began dating the following year. On the advice of Wonder, Wright became a songwriter. Their first collaboration, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot;, was recorded by The Spinners, in 1969. Motown withheld its release until July 1970. The song reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Wright also began singing backing for Wonder, most notably on the hit &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I&#x27;m Yours)&quot;, which Wright co-wrote with Wonder. On 14 September 1970, after a year-long courtship, Wright, 24, and Wonder, 20, married in Detroit. The couple then wrote and arranged songs for Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot;, which was released much to Berry Gordy&#x27;s chagrin in the spring of 1971. The Wonder–Wright composition &quot;If You Really Love Me&quot; (which also featured Wright prominently singing background vocals) reached number 8 in the US that year. In 1971 the couple relocated to New York City.

===Solo career===
In between working with Wonder on his albums, Wright decided to return to her own singing career. Motown reassigned the singer from Motown&#x27;s Gordy imprint, where &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give Back the Love I Feel for You&quot; was released, to Motown&#x27;s L.A.-based MoWest subsidiary. Wonder and Wright had marriage troubles and divorced in the summer of 1972, ending their 18-month marriage. Following their divorce, Wonder oversaw the production of Wright&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Syreeta&quot; (released on June 20, 1972), which included her take of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;I Love Every Little Thing About You&quot; from &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;, the Smokey Robinson classic &quot;What Love Has Joined Together&quot;, and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, which featured both Wonder and Wright applying background vocals via the talk box. MoWest issued &quot;I Love Every Little Thing About You&quot; in the late winter of 1972, but it failed to chart. Remaining best friends, Wright would continue to provide background vocals and compositions with Wonder for the next two decades.

In 1974, Wright was again reassigned, this time to the Motown label proper (in the U.S.), and issued her second release, the aptly titled &quot;Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta&quot; that June. Following the success of Minnie Riperton&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;, which Wonder also produced, Wonder wanted to present Wright in the same light as Riperton as a sensual vocalist. The covers also were very similar to each other. Riperton added background vocals to the album, primarily at the end of the album track &quot;Heavy Day&quot;. The album yielded the UK singles &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Left&quot; (covered by Eric Clapton and Jerry Butler), &quot;Spinnin&#x27; and Spinnin&#x27;&quot; and the reggae-flavored &quot;Your Kiss Is Sweet&quot;, which became a UK top 40, reaching number 12 in 1975. The album also featured one duet with G. C. Cameron, formerly of the Spinners.

Production on Wright&#x27;s third album, &quot;One to One&quot; mainly produced by Leon Ware, who also produced Marvin Gaye and Riperton, went on for two years. The album featured the sole Wonder production, &quot;Harmour Love&quot;, which later would find some success after being featured on the 2005 movie &quot;Junebug&quot;. During this period Syreeta also made vocal contributions to two albums by American jazz saxophonist Gary Bartz - &quot;Juju Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;Music Is My Sanctuary&quot; (1977). In 1977, she teamed up again with G.C. Cameron on the duet album, &quot;Rich Love, Poor Love&quot;.

Wright&#x27;s next effort came courtesy of a chance meeting with Billy Preston, who had signed with Motown in early 1979. Motown assigned the two to collaborate on a pop ballad for the movie &quot;Fast Break&quot;. Wright and Preston provided the soundtrack of the film and their first collaboration, &quot;With You I&#x27;m Born Again&quot;, resulted in an international hit reaching number-four US and number-two UK in early 1980. The success of the song led Motown to renew Wright&#x27;s contract, which was due to expire that year, with neither side looking to renegotiate. Wright and Preston continued their collaborations until the early 1980s including the 1981 duet album, &quot;Billy Preston &amp; Syreeta&quot;. Wright had also sung on Billy Preston&#x27;s appearance on the debut episode of Saturday Night Live, on October 11, 1975.

Wright still worked with Wonder during this period singing the lead vocals for their composition &quot;Come Back as a Flower&quot; for Wonder&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Journey through the Secret Life of Plants&quot; and also sung alongside Wonder on his 1980 song &quot;As If You Read My Mind&quot; for his &quot;Hotter than July&quot; album. Wright continued to provide background vocals until Wonder&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Conversation Peace&quot;.

Wright continued to record for Motown into the 1980s, releasing her second self-titled album in 1980, and the funk/boogie-oriented &quot;Set My Love in Motion&quot; in late 1981. The album featured the minor R&amp;B hit &quot;Quick Slick&quot;, which peaked at number 41 R&amp;B in early 1982. During that same time period, she added vocals to the theme song for the Canadian slasher-horror flick &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot;, known for starring &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;′s Melissa Sue Anderson. Wright then issued &quot;The Spell&quot; in 1983 produced by Jermaine Jackson, and left Motown two years later after collaborating with Smokey Robinson for the soundtrack to Berry Gordy&#x27;s &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; in 1985. She briefly recorded for Motorcity Records before retiring from show business for good in the mid-1990s and settling in Los Angeles with her four children. In 1993, she joined the national touring cast of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in the role of Mary Magdalene, alongside original film stars Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson. She stayed in the cast until 1995. In 1997, she guested on British soul singer Omar&#x27;s album, &quot;This Is Not a Love Song&quot;, singing the duet &quot;Lullaby&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Wright was married three times and had four children. Her first marriage, to longtime collaborator Stevie Wonder, lasted 18 months, from September 1970 until 1972. In 1975, Wright married bassist Curtis Robertson Jr., with whom she had two children, Jamal Robertson (b. 1976) and Hodari Robertson (b. 1979). Wright and Robertson divorced in 1982.

Wright briefly lived in Ethiopia in the mid-1970s, where she worked as a Transcendental Meditation teacher. She eventually settled in Los Angeles, where she lived for the rest of her life.

Wright died in 2004 of congestive heart failure, a side effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatments she was receiving for breast and bone cancer. She was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery.

<text>Monopoly is an American television game show based on the board game of the same name. The format was created by Merv Griffin and produced by his production company, Merv Griffin Enterprises.

&quot;Monopoly&quot; aired as a summer replacement series on ABC along with &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot;, a special tournament edition of Griffin&#x27;s quiz show. &quot;Monopoly&quot; premiered on June 16, 1990, and aired following &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot; for twelve consecutive Saturday nights until September 1, 1990.

Former &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestant Mike Reilly was chosen to host the series, with Charlie O&#x27;Donnell as announcer. Three separate women, Kathy Davis, Kathy Karges, and Michelle Nicholas, served as the co-host/dice roller.

==Gameplay==

===First round===
Three contestants played, each represented by a color (red, gold, and green).

Contestants attempted to take control of the eight groups of colored properties on a giant Monopoly board. To do so, they had to solve crossword-style clues. The first letter of each answer was given to the contestants, and each side of the four-sided board, referred to as &quot;blocks&quot; (with the block containing the five properties between the Go to Jail corner and &quot;GO&quot; referred to as the &quot;high rent district&quot;), had a different starting letter for clues. Each clue was a toss-up, and answering correctly won money equal to the value of the property, from $60 for Mediterranean Avenue to $400 for Boardwalk. Answering incorrectly deducted that value from a contestant&#x27;s score. In the event that all three contestants failed to answer a clue, the property value was cut in half and another clue was read.

Each color group, referred to as a monopoly, had to be controlled by one of the contestants before play moved on to another. Once a contestant controlled a monopoly, the total monetary value of its properties was added to his/her score. The lowest monopoly value was $120, which was for Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues. The highest was $920, for the three-property monopoly consisting of Pacific, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania Avenues.

If the properties in a monopoly ended up under the control of multiple contestants, a series of toss-up clues were played between them to determine ownership. A contestant who owned two properties in a group of three had to give one correct answer in order to take full control, while the contestant who owned the third had to give two. If all three contestants each owned one property, the first to give a correct answer challenged one opponent and took over the property of the other, and the remainder of the showdown followed the two-contestant format. An incorrect answer on the initial toss-up forfeited that contestant&#x27;s property, which was then awarded to one of the others through a second toss-up. In the case of the Mediterranean/Baltic and Park Place/Boardwalk monopolies being split between two contestants, the first to answer a clue correctly took control.

===Big Money Round===
During the commercial break following the completion of the first round, the contestants used the money they had earned to build houses and hotels on their properties. These cost $50 and $250 respectively, regardless of the properties&#x27; position on the board, and contestants had to build evenly within a color group. The number of houses/hotels on a property determined the amount of its rent, which was used as the value of its clues.

Once the contestants&#x27; construction purchases had been revealed and the corresponding cost deducted from their scores, the Big Money Round began. An indicator light started at &quot;GO&quot; and moved clockwise around the board, according to the total of two oversized dice rolled by the show&#x27;s hostess. Every contestant received a $200 bonus whenever the indicator light passed or landed on &quot;GO.&quot;

If a property was landed on, O&#x27;Donnell called out its rent value and Reilly read a clue to the contestant who owned it. A correct response added the rent value to his/her score. A miss incurred no penalty but allowed either of the opponents to buzz in under the same rules as the first round, with an incorrect answer deducting from that contestant&#x27;s score.

Squares other than properties affected the gameplay as follows:

*Utilities (Electric Company and Water Works): a tossup clue was asked, worth $100 times the total on the dice.
*Railroads: if the indicator light landed on one of the four railroads, contestants got the chance to &quot;ride&quot; the particular railroad to a monopoly and initiate a &quot;hostile takeover&quot;. A tossup was asked, and the first contestant to answer the clue correctly chose one of his/her opponents&#x27; monopolies to take over. The indicator light then moved to the first property in the chosen monopoly, and the contestant trying to take it over had to answer a series of clues unopposed, one for each property. Every correct answer advanced the indicator light to the next property in line. If the contestant answered all the clues correctly, he/she won control of the monopoly; its combined value was added to his/her score, and any houses or hotels built on it became his/her property. A wrong answer ended the takeover attempt and the contestant had to pay the corresponding rent to the owner of the monopoly, based on where the indicator was when the wrong answer was given.
*Chance and Community Chest: a card was drawn from the appropriate deck and its instructions (bonuses, fines, movement) were followed.
*Tax Spaces: landing on Income Tax deducted 10% from every contestant&#x27;s score, while Luxury Tax deducted $75.
*Free Parking: a tossup was asked and the first contestant to answer correctly won $500, plus all money collected in taxes/fines since the last correct Free Parking response.
*Go To Jail: if the indicator landed on this space, it moved to the &quot;In Jail&quot; space and each contestant lost $250.

The second round was played until time was called. At this point, all houses and hotels were sold back to the bank at their original purchase price and the money was credited to the contestants who owned the properties, regardless of who had originally built them. The contestant with the highest total won the game, kept his/her money, and advanced to the bonus round.

===Bonus Round (&quot;Once Around the Board&quot;)===
The champion tried to complete one full clockwise circuit of the board within five rolls while staying out of jail. The contestant first chose four spaces – one each on the maroon/orange and red/yellow sides, and two on the green/blue side – to become Go to Jail spaces. The original Go to Jail space remained on the board, for a total of five Go to Jail spaces.

The champion started at &quot;GO&quot; and rolled the dice to move around the board. The contestant could quit and take $100 per space passed after each successful roll. Rolling doubles awarded an extra roll. The champion won $25,000 for passing &quot;GO&quot; without running out of rolls, or $50,000 for landing on &quot;GO&quot; exactly. If the champion landed on a Go to Jail space at any time, the round ended and he/she forfeited the money. The contestant won $100 for each space passed if all rolls were exhausted and the contestant failed to pass &quot;GO&quot; without landing on a &quot;Go to Jail&quot; space.

==Production information==
Merv Griffin created the series and served as executive producer. &quot;Monopoly&quot; was paired with &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot; for its 12-week run on ABC.

Host Mike Reilly competed on the television game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 1989. Reilly later worked as a waiter before being selected a year later by producer Merv Griffin to perform as a contestant on the pilot for &quot;Monopoly&quot;. After the pilot with Peter Tomarken as host was taped, Reilly was selected as host. The pilot was produced for syndication, but could not gain clearances. Tomarken clashed with producers over production elements, which included Patty Maloney dressed in the Mr. Monopoly character.

==International version==
A Welsh version of the show, hosted by Derec Brown aired on S4C for a brief period in 1992.
The Bulgarian version was at the period 1996-1997 at Kanal 1.

<doc id="1143950" wikidata="Q493538" url="?curid=1143950" title="Dark Ages (1999 video game)">
<text>Dark Ages is a MMORPG based on Celtic mythology, originally developed by Nexon and now operated by KRU Interactive. It is loosely based on the Korean game &quot;Legend of Darkness&quot;. The American version was developed by David Ethan Kennerly who based it somewhat on the works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft (in particular, on &quot;The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;). The game originally thrived on player involvement in the management of the game and progression of the storyline, even going so far as allowing players control over in-game politics and laws.

In 2003, the add-on &quot;Dark Ages: Medenia&quot; was released. In 2020, a major update for &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was revealed, featuring an upgraded game engine, enhanced resolutions (up to 1024 x 576), and various gameplay improvements.

==Expositional lore==
In a long past era, the people called Tuatha de Danaan (&quot;Children of Danaan&quot;) arrived in the lands of Temuair, meaning Earth-Sea in the Tuathan tongue. A civilization formed there called Hy-brasyl. It was a peaceful time, in harmony with nature. For the first time, after a millennium of peace had existed, a man is found murdered, and exploration into the outside world begins. With this comes the harnessing of the elements for magical power.

Along with this exploration, Kadath, the worldly home of the gods, is discovered. Dark altars and temples are constructed, and the priests of these dark gods go mad in their search for divine knowledge. In this madness, Hy-brasyl is drowned, causing the death of all those who know the forbidden knowledge.

Over 300 years go by until the knowledge is regained, and along with the four other elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind), a fifth is discovered: Darkness. With this discovery come the Dubhaimid, the dark ones. Formed by the Dark God Chadul, these dark forces terrorize Temuair. The wise amongst the Tuatha de Danaan return to the worship of the Light Goddess Danaan, who enters into the Great War with Chadul.

Many years later, the Six Lords of Temuair meet to form an unholy Pact with Chadul. Led by Tenes, King of Ardmagh, the Anaman Pact is formed, granting each of the Lords a 1000-year lifespan and the unity of Temuair. In the ensuing war, Danaan&#x27;s chosen Paladin, Ainmeal, fights against Tenes in battle and wins, ending another dark threat. Ainmeal renames Ardmagh to &quot;Loures&quot;.

Again much time of peace passes, until the 4th Empress of Loures, Ealagad, comes to power. She seeks to rekindle the power of Chadul and does so, restoring the Dubhaimid to Temuair. Danaan again intervenes, this time by sacrificing Herself in order to defeat Chadul for the final time. With the end of this Shadows War, the first of the Aislings (Dreamers) are born, free from their old mundane life, and making a difference in the new Atavism Age.

==Character customization==
Players begin the game with the creation of a new character. They may select a name up to 12 characters long. They may then select the gender and hair color of the character. A limited selection of gender-specific hairstyles is then chosen, eighteen styles for males and seventeen for females. Players then enter their desired password and enter the game as the default Peasant class.

Characters are broken up into the archetypal character classes of Warrior, Monk, Priest, Wizard and Rogue, with the default being Peasant. To become one of the common classes, players must enter a specific building in the starting town of Mileth. They may bring a player of the desired class to initiate them into the class, or may elect to do so alone, with the NPC as their initiator.

===Classes===
====Peasant====
Though a default class, players may choose to advance the Peasant class to level ninetyninety-nine nine. This class has no class-specific weapons or armors and receives the benefit of no special class-specific skills or spells. Any equipment which a peasant can use and wield can be used or wielded by any of the other classes in the game. This class does have the benefit of the lowest experience points required to level up. It is balanced by being the most difficult class to level up, having no skills or spells. A peasant may place all one hundred and ninety-six points gained from their levels into any of their stats, as there is no limit on a peasant&#x27;s stats.

====Warrior====
The archetypal fighting class is the Warrior. Warriors excel in hand-to-hand combat and gain the most armor value from their class-specific armors. They have a small selection of shields and one-handed weapons which only warrior may use and a selection of two handed weapons. This class gains the benefit of the most instant melee skills. Warriors also have a number of class specific combat skills most of which cause damage to targets in combat. Most of these skills have short cooldown periods. The warrior class has a very limited selection of spells, mostly only to attract enemy monsters or assist the characters defense against attack. Warriors smith many common weapons to become lighter and cause more damage.

====Monk====
The Monk is the master of hand-to-hand fighting. They have a limited selection of class specific weapon, most of which are hand claw type weapons. Monks enjoy a number of class specific skills and spells, most of which are combat skills and used to mitigate their more limited selection of instant melee skills. The monk class has the next highest armor rating of their class specific armors, after warriors. While monks may use any common weapons, many of their class skills require them to have either no weapon or monk-only weapons equipped in order to function. The majority of a monk&#x27;s combat damage is from their skills. Their spell selection is less limited than the warriors as they have the ability to remove blindness and poison status from themselves or other characters some slight healing spells and defense spells that can provide complete invincibility to damage for a brief amount of time. Monks may also practice herbalism to create potions which have similar effect to their spells. Many of the monk&#x27;s skills and spells are based on the monk teaching Dugons to other monks. Dugons are similar to the belt system of karate in theory, but progress to the next dugon is based on how many pupils the monk has taught dugons to.

====Rogue====
The Rogue is touted as the intermediate class between the basher classes and the caster classes though the class functions more as a basher. Rogues heavily rely on trap skills which places a damage or status inflicting trap on a tile on which enemies must step. Rogue traps either cause damage or poison, blind or sleep status. Rogues have the ability to hide from monsters and other characters in order to move around without attention. Rogues have a decent ability in hand-to-hand combat and have a number of class specific weapons; melee daggers or thrown daggers and shuriken type weapons called surigams. Rogues may also change the hairstyle of other characters from a selection of around 80 gender specific styles. They have the next strongest armors from monks. Rogues can also smith their class specific weapons to become lighter and cause more damage.

====Priest====
The Priest class has a few abilities in hand-to-hand combat and is a poor melee fighter. Their armors are the second weakest of all common classes. Priests enjoy a large selection of spells most of which protect themselves or others from danger either through removing of curses which cause armours values to drop, remove most negative status ailments or healing other characters. The class also enjoys a wide variety of spells which cause status ailments of blindness, sleep, poison, frozen in place, or curses which reduce armor values. The priest class also casts a limited selection of direct damage spells, which are based on the Light element. Priest specific weapons are specialized staffs which reduce the waiting time for their spells to discharge. Priests may also create the same potions as monks. They are the only class which can progress beyond Acolyte status in the eight religious shrines.

====Wizard====
The Wizard is the archetypal magical attacker. This class also has a few abilities in hand-to-hand combat making them a poor melee fighter. Their amours are the weakest in the game rendering wizards the most susceptible to damage from enemies. Wizards are masters of the elements and most of their spells are based on the four elements of fire, air, earth and water called in the game, respectively: srad, athar, creag and sal. Their spells revolve around causing direct damage with elemental spells, and although a max-level in wizard can decimate entire legions of foes from afar with a wide variety of potent spells, a wizard who is still in the process of leveling will find it impractical to attempt to be a damage dealer and will instead only focus on strengthening the elemental affinities of friends and foes. Strong spells require lots of stats, nobody expects (or wants) wizards to deal damage in a group setting while leveling, and not pumping WIS will result in a vastly lower MP pool, plus the players can just pick up the spells they missed leveling up at 99. For these reasons most wizards plan their character with level 99 in mind and pump their WIS high as early as possible, resulting in giant mana pools compared to a character that does not. Wizards can also increase the elemental affinity of enemies or allies (an important mechanic in &quot;Dark Ages&quot;), and switching the elemental affinities of enemies, but the latter function of forced elemental affinity switching does not work on any enemies the same level or higher than the wizard, rendering it useless against any enemies that a top-level wizard would fight. Wizards may learn Dark element spells which cause direct damage in combat. Wizards also gain some spells that steal MP from group members or draw MP from specialized potions that contain the essence of the elements. Wizards can also enchant equipment either to become lighter and make the wearer more likely to successfully strike their opponent, detract less MP from the wearer or grant extra MP to the wearer, make the wearer cause more damage, or get an increase in hp from the gear. Wizards may practice alchemy to create some items. They may also practice necromancy which summons monsters to fight for the wizard. Wizard-specific weapons are staffs that predominantly lower the time needed for spells to discharge.

===Stats===
&quot;Dark Ages&quot; uses a system of 5 primary stats and 4 secondary stats. Primary stats start at 3, and 2 primary stat points are gained every time a character increases in level. These points can be spent to increase a character&#x27;s stats. Stats can also be altered by equipped items worn by the character. The primary stats are STR (Strength), CON (Constitution), DEX (Dexterity), INT (Intelligence), and WIS (Wisdom).

* STR determines the damage of many melee combat skills and assails, the maximum weight limit of gear worn and carried in a character&#x27;s inventory. 
* CON determines the amount of health regenerated per cycle, the amount of health gained upon leveling and the damage of certain monk skills. 
* DEX determines the chance to evade melee attacks and the damage of some rogue skills. 
* INT determines the damage inflicted by damage spells. 
* WIS determines the amount of mana regenerated per cycle, mana gained upon leveling, and the amount healed by priest healing spells.

The secondary stats are MR (Magic Resistance), AC (Armor Class), HIT, and DMG (Damage). Secondary stats are modified by gear.

* MR determines the odds of a hostile spell missing a character. Characters start with a base MR of 0. 
* AC determines how much damage is reduced when dealt to a character. Characters start with a base AC of 100; improvements to armor class lower the number, while negative effects, such as the curse spell used by Priests, &quot;Ard Cradh&quot;, increase armor class. 
* HIT determines the likelihood of an assail skill hitting. DMG increases the damage of assail skills. Characters start with a base HIT and DMG of 0.

Learning skills and spells require the character to have a certain amount of each stat, for example for a Warrior to learn the &quot;Windblade&quot; ability, the following stat levels need to be reached: INT and CON to 5, STR to 6, and DEX to 12. The ability can then be learned after presenting the trainer with a specific item(s) and/or gold. Many players plan their character around using items to boost stats so they can learn skills with the fewest points spent. The excess points can be spent in CON or WIS, allowing the character to enjoy a greatly improved HP or MP pool and regeneration while leveling.

HP and MP are the standards hit point and magic points. HP is reduced from receiving damage in combat from enemies, and if it is reduced to 0 results in the death of the character except under special circumstances. If a character is a member of a party, instead of immediate death the character is in a swooning state in which they cannot move or use skills, spells, potions or complete any action other than speech. It is commonly called Skulling in the game, in reference to the skull which appears over the character head for a short duration. Other characters may use a specialized potion to cancel the effect and return the character to 1 HP during the duration. Otherwise, the spell ends and the character dies per usual. HP and MP are increased every time the character gains a level based on a mathematical formula involving the characters CON stat for HP or the characters WIS stat for MP.

===Rededication and Mastering===
Once a character has reached level ninety-nine in their class or their new class, they may Master. All classes except peasant may either rededicate their class or become a master of their class once they reach level ninety-nine in their class. 

* To Rededicate (also known as sub-classing or &#x27;subbing&#x27;), a player character becomes one of the other four common classes. This requires sacrificing all gained levels and the ability to use their previous class&#x27;s weapons and armor, but they keep the abilities learned in the previous class. All player characters that reach level ninety-nine again after undergoing this process have the option to Master again.
* To Master, player characters must obtain specific items used in the process. Mastering grants the ability to raise player&#x27;s stats to the maximum level of their respective class, as well as a specialized weapon and armor. Masters also learn some new class-specific skills/spells. 
* Those with only one class, called &#x27;pures&#x27; in the game, gain additional skills or spells that rededicated subs do not receive. Although pure-exclusive skills were weak or non-existent, pure-exclusive skills are extremely potent and are worth the enormous sacrifice of every pre-99 ability of another class.
* Once a character is a master they may turn experience into more HP or MP, and turn any excess HP over a minimum requirement into bonus stats (although the limit for stats is capped based on player&#x27;s class, HP and MP levels are not).

===Grand mastering and Medenian classes===
The warrior, monk, rogue, priest and wizard classes may all upgrade their class after mastering and completing the grand master quests: 
* Grand mastering is accomplished by completing long and tough quests that will require the help of friends and rewards the players with class-specific equipment that is superior to player&#x27;s Master equipment. There is no title change to &quot;Grand Master&quot; and no new abilities, but the Grand Master equipment is much flashier and stronger than the Master equipment, and looks differently for &#x27;pures&#x27; and &#x27;subs&#x27;. 
* The character may then elect to sacrifice the master and grandmaster weapons and armors and sacrifice some accumulated experience, HP and MP to take on a Medenian class. Warriors become Gladiators&#x27;, Monks become Druids, Rogues become Archers, Priests become Bards, while Wizards become Summoners. 
* The class&#x27;s style of gameplay is altered with the class change, and new skills and spells are gained. Characters also learn the use of new weapons, and may wear new class-specific armors in their new class. 
* Advanced classes function similarly to the common classes, albeit instead of accumulating experience to gain levels, the character accumulated ability points to increase ability levels. Certain enemies give ability points as well as experience points when defeated. Some quests give both experience and AP, and some give only AP.

==Gameplay==
The view in &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is isometric except when leaving certain zones. Zones will either link to another zone at specific points, or else lead to a world map. When a player leaves a zone and goes onto the world map the player will click map points to change location to a new zone. Some zones may only be clicked by approaching from other specific zones, giving movement a feel of travel. Movement in a zone is based on the cardinal directions, in a skewed view. The Up arrow corresponds to cardinal northeast. Movement is accomplished by turning or moving with the arrow keys or by right-clicking tiles on the map to walk to. Combat occurs in real-time, in the standard isometric view, usually in specific hunting grounds. Players may hold the spacebar to attack adjacent enemies with assails. This will cease when the spacebar is released. They may also double right click the target to attack. Double right-clicking an enemy will both walk the character to whatever adjacent side is closest, and will use the assail skills until the character faces or moves away, presses the spacebar or is defeated. Skills and spells all appear in a specific window pane, and may either be clicked to activate unless the specific skill or spell also requires targeting. In such a case the player also clicks their mouse on the target. Alternatively, skills or spells which must have a target may be dragged from the skill or spell pane onto the target and the skill or spell is used. The 1 through = keys are hotkeys and may be pressed to use the appropriate skill or spell, subject to the targeting function.

===Combat===
Much of the focus of gameplay is combat either in hunting grounds or in certain specific PvP areas. There are numerous hunting grounds in &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. Many hunting grounds are designed for characters of specific levels or ability levels. They may have a broad or narrow range and may exclude characters above or below the thresholds of entry. Some hunting grounds are for gaining experience only and some are for gaining both experience points and ability points. Some are only opened by completing or engaging in specific quests. Many hunting grounds are only hunted for the items or money that can be acquired therein.

There are three PvP forums in &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and one team arena. The first, called Honour Fields, is for solo combat between warriors only in a small arena. The second, called the arena, is for registered players only, and contains the team arena, a free-for-all PVP arena and an arena for hosted matches of one to four teams. The team arena pits two teams against each other fighting for control of three towers and points are accumulated for defeating the other team players, for taking control of a tower and points accumulate over time for each tower controlled. The last PvP forum is the Medenia arena. There are three different zones in the arena and any character registered or not may enter and compete. There is also a PvE quest in this arena for registered characters.

===Quests===
Quests are accomplished in a routine manner. They are also very few and long and involve speaking to different NPCs in story arcs, bringing specific items to NPCs or delivering goods from one to another. Many quests involve entering specific hunting grounds and defeating a particular monster which may only be attempted as part of the quest. The benefit of quests are varied, with some granting experience points, AP, new items, or access to new zones.

===Religion===
====Temuairan Faiths====
Each Temple has a clergy made entirely of players. Players may hold any of the following ranks:

* Probate is the rank of initiated, unregistered players. It is also the rank of any Priest who has been the target of a heresy action. These people have the ability to pray when in the Temple of their God.
* Worshipper is the rank of initiated, registered players. These people have the ability to pray in the Temple of their God or when elsewhere, by use of their Prayer Necklace. They may also be sent on religious geasea by any Priest or higher of their Temple.
* Acolyte is the rank of Clergy-Helper. These people must be appointed by a person of rank Priest or higher. They have all the abilities of a Worshipper, as well as the ability to summon creatures of their God. They may also receive Holy Symbols of their God from a Cleric or higher. If a Priest or a Wizard, they may also receive a Holy or Magus staff of their God. Acolytes also have the ability to remove an enemy God&#x27;s blessing from an item. Acolytes are also the only people who may begin a heresy action, which removes a Priest or higher from power.
* Priest is the lowest rank of the actual Clergy, and is obtainable only by members of the Priest class. To become a Priest, the players must have been an Acolyte for two double-moons (two weeks). Priests can initiate new worshippers, banish people from the Temple, and consecrate items (adding their God&#x27;s touch to the item). They may also invite unregistered people into the Temple. Priests can hold a Mass, which gives all present worshippers of the Trinity 50k experience. Priests can also destroy items if they are touched by an enemy God, or may simply remove the enemy God&#x27;s touch. Priests are also able to send Worshippers or higher on Geasea.
* Cleric is obtainable only by those who have won a rank of &quot;Clave&quot; or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 40 people to obtain Cleric alone, or 20 people if assisted by a Minister or higher. Clerics have all the abilities of a Priest, and may also create Holy Symbols, Holy Staves of their God, and Magus Staves of their God.
* Minister is obtainable only by those who have won a rank of &quot;Village&quot; or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 40 people in order to obtain Minister alone, or 80 people if assisted by a High Priest. Ministers have all the abilities of a Cleric.
* High Priest is obtainable also by those who have won a rank of &quot;Village&quot; or above in any contest. They must have initiated at least 160 people into their Temple. High Priests have all the abilities of a Minister and may also excommunicate members. This act will cause the High Priest to lose ten initiations, lose all of his faith, and forcibly remove any member of the Fellowship from the Fellowship.

====Medenian Faiths====
The Medenian faiths are simple. The character chooses one of the 3 elemental spirits to offer prayers to. The character may remain a member of a Temuairan faith while being in a Medenian faith. The character may pray to the spirit to increase standing in the faith. When groups of characters pray together under specific circumstances they may be furnished with a special pet or item.

===Politics===
One of the other unique features of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; created by David Ethan Kennerly is the political system. Originally only two towns - Rucesion and Mileth - were involved in the player-run politics, but later the separate in-game continent of Medenia has also developed a player-run politic of its own. An update to the game in 2017 reduced clout requirements to hold political office. Clout is a meta-currency stored on a character&#x27;s legend, and is gained through other players &quot;voting&quot;, which can be done once per 12 hours, or through winning a contest.

Respected Citizen is not a true political position. It requires 5 clout (previously 10), and it requires that players have mentored at least one person. They gain the ability to admit people as citizens of player&#x27;s town, and the ability to dye clothing with the help of another tailor.

====Judicial Branch====
* Guard is a rank where the holder enforces the town&#x27;s laws. Guards must have been a Respected Citizen for at least one term, and require 10 clout (previously 25) to take office. They may banish any person from their town for 24 hours. They may also sponsor others to run for political office. They wear a green or blue tabard, depending on what town they are from.
* Guard Captain is a rank above Guard. Guard Captains must have four terms of Guard, and require 20 clout (previously 50) to take office. They have the same abilities as a Guard, and wear the same tabard with the addition of a helmet indicating their higher status. They organize the Guards, hold meetings, and review cases brought to them.
* Judge is the highest judicial rank. Judges must have held four terms of Guard Captain and require 25 clout (previously 100) to take office. They may hold trials, which is where citizens try to appeal banishments and exiles. These trials involve a jury, prosecutor, and defendant. They may also sponsor others to run for political office. Judges wear a fluffy robe colored with their town&#x27;s color. Judges may perform the same functions as Guards and Guard Captains, as well as order exiles, removals of bad officials, and barment from office. They may also order a player be Sgathed, which is a form of capital punishment (though Sgathed players do not have their characters suffer permadeath necessarily) for the worst offenders.

====Legislative Branch====
* Demagogue is the lowest rank of the Legislative Branch. Demagogues must have held four terms of Respected Citizen, and require 20 clout (previously 50) to take office. They may make the town&#x27;s laws, and also may exile people from their town permanently upon a Judge&#x27;s order. Demagogues may also sponsor others for political office. Demagogues wear a full-body robe of their town&#x27;s color.
* Burgess is the highest rank of the Legislative Branch. Burgesses must have held four terms of Demagogue and require 50 clout (previously 200) to take office. They have the same power as Demagogues, but are often granted other responsibilities and powers by the town&#x27;s laws.

====Outside the towns====
Outside of the towns, there are two other forces that uphold Mundane Mandate (Terms of Service). 

* Terms of service enforcement is performed by a group of players called the Rangers. They can be recognized by their yellow tabards. They have the ability to jail people for violating the Terms of Service, and arrest individuals for automated improvement of skills and spells. Both a jailing and an arrest place a player in a jail cell in the dungeon of the capital city. Players who have been jailed will be confined to the cell for four hours to 7 days, depending on the number of jails accumulated. Players who have been arrested may walk out of the jail cell at any point. Once the players reach a certain number of arrests, they may be blocked from the game; currently, reaching a total of six jails and/or arrests will result in losing access to your character for a fixed period of time.
* The other force is the Knights, who act as KRU&#x27;s agents in the game. They handle player requests and ideas, but they also report extreme abuses to KRU directly. 

ToS violations outside of player-run towns are the exclusive remit of Rangers. Knights and, to a certain extent, rangers are appointed through nomination and merit, respectively.

===Nobility===
There is a contest system in &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. The players enter works of literature or art as a contest entry, to be judged by previous winners. The game developers make the final decision on what exclusive content is awarded. Players submit their entries in different categories. Literature entries are short stories or poetry relating to the theme of the game or characters in the game world. History entries are stories written as historical documents that relate to the storyline of the game and may influence the plots of content released by the developer. Lore entries are compendiums of factual technical information relating to the game: item lists, monster statistics, maps, etc. Philosophy entries are philosophical theories of the role-played character, relating to the game world and how the character relates to it. Art entries are any works of art the player has created that have a basis in the theme of the game world. Examples include drawings or paintings of the imagined settings, characters, monsters, sculptures of game figures, webcomics or animation etc. The music category was removed from the contest system, though works of music could perhaps be entered as art entries. Players who create these works may choose to enter them after attaining education points from attending roleplayed classes hosted by previous contest winners. Players gain in-game rewards after winning a contest. They may also form new guilds, teach in the college themselves, and judge new contest entries upon becoming a noble. Nobles also have the power to remove people from the college area, and denounce other nobles which can remove their awards. Noble priests have the right to advance further in their respective religions.

<doc id="1143957" wikidata="Q1409611" url="?curid=1143957" title="Port-wine stain">
<text>A port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) is a discoloration of the human skin caused by a vascular anomaly (a capillary malformation in the skin). They are so named for their coloration, which is similar in color to port wine, a fortified red wine from Portugal.

A port-wine stain is a capillary malformation, seen at birth. Port-wine stains persist throughout life. The area of skin affected grows in proportion to general growth.

Port-wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body, particularly on the neck, upper trunk, arms and legs. Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance. As the child matures, the color may deepen to a dark red or purplish color. In adulthood, thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur.

Port-wine stains may be part of a syndrome such as Sturge–Weber syndrome or Klippel–Trénaunay–Weber syndrome.

==Types==

Nevus flammeus may be divided as follows:
*Nevus flammeus nuchae
* Midline nevus flammeus - also known as salmon patch and angel&#x27;s kiss, is a vascular birthmark which may be found on the glabellar region or on one upper eyelid, and presents in approximately 15% of newborns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Port-wine stains were shown to be caused by a somatic activating c.548G→A mutation in the GNAQ gene. An association with RASA1 has also been described.

==Diagnosis==
A healthcare provider can usually diagnose a port-wine stain based entirely upon the history and appearance. In unusual cases, a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the location of the birthmark and other associated symptoms, a physician may choose to order a measurement of intraocular pressure or X-ray of the skull.

An MRI of the brain may be performed (under anesthesia) on infants who have a port-wine stain in the head area in order to check for signs of Sturge–Weber syndrome.

If the port-wine stain is inside the mouth, a provider may check the insides of a newborn baby&#x27;s throat with a scope to see if there are any changes (growths) other than just the color.

If the port-wine stain is around the eye or on the eyelid, a referral may be made to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a test of the ocular pressures in that eye. If swelling occurs in the port-wine stain, it may cause vision problems, glaucoma, or blindness.

==Treatment==
Many treatments have been tried for port-wine stains including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing; port-wine stains can also be covered with cosmetics.

Lasers may be able to destroy the capillaries without significant damage to the overlying skin. Lasers and other light sources may therefore be able to reduce the redness of port-wine stains, although there is not enough evidence to recommend one form over another.

For most people in trials of pulsed dye laser, more than 25% of the redness was reduced by laser after one to three treatments. Adverse effects were rare in these trials, although some people had changes to the color of the skin, especially Chinese people with darker skin. There can be pain, crusting, and blistering in the two weeks after treatment. The trials only followed people for six months, so long-term outcomes are not known. Up to 10 treatments may be necessary for improvement, but complete removal may not result. The use of topical rapamycin as an adjunct to pulsed dye laser may improve results.

Treatment is generally given before one year of age.

With older laser treatments the skin is filled with black marks, the size of a pen. This is due to the laser instrument&#x27;s size; the black marks disappear within 1–3 weeks. The treated area can be sore and swollen for a couple of days. However, with newer v-beam laser treatments, there may not be any marks at all.

==Prognosis==
In the absence of successful treatment, hypertrophy (increased tissue mass) of the stains may cause problems later in life, such as loss of function (especially if the stain is near the eye or mouth), bleeding, and increasing disfigurement. Lesions on or near the eyelid can be associated with glaucoma. If the port-wine stain is on the face or other highly visible part of the body, its presence can also cause emotional and social problems for the affected person.

==Epidemiology==
Studies have recorded an incidence of about 3–5 cases per 1,000 newborn babies.

<doc id="1143966" wikidata="Q2905369" url="?curid=1143966" title="St. Catharines Black Hawks">
<text>The St. Catharines Black Hawks were a Canadian junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1962 to 1976. The team was based in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
In 1962 the Chicago Black Hawks sponsored the financially troubled St. Catharines Teepees, and renamed the team St. Catharines Black Hawks. Chicago continued to do so until NHL sponsorship ended in 1968. From 1968 until 1972, the Hawks were owned by Fred Muller and Ken Campbell.

St. Catharines made it to the OHA finals in 1969, 1971 and 1974. They were beaten in the 1969 OHA finals by the Montreal Junior Canadiens 4 wins to 0 with 2 ties. The Black Hawks won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1971 versus the Toronto Marlboros &amp; 1974 versus the Peterborough Petes.

The 1971 Richardson Trophy series between St. Catharines and the Quebec Remparts is one of the most storied ever, featuring riots and two future Hall of Famers, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne. In the 1974 Memorial Cup tournament the Black Hawks would square up against the Regina Pats and a rematch versus the Quebec Remparts.

Hap Emms bought the Black Hawks in 1972 and for the next four years attendance declined to the point that Emms refused to suffer any more losses and moved the club to Niagara Falls in 1976, rejuvenating the name of the previous Niagara Falls Flyers team which Emms had also owned.

Many blamed the poor support for the clubs on Emms’ failure to promote the team, but there were extenuating factors such as the attraction of the nearby Buffalo Sabres, expanded TV coverage of hockey and Tier II hockey in the area.

===Richardson Cup 1971===
The Eastern Canadian championship of 1971 was the most controversial of the series ever played for the Richardson Cup. It was also the last Eastern Canadian championship to be played before the Memorial Cup tournament began in 1972.

The series that featured future NHL stars Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne, never lived up to the potential on ice brilliance that could have been. Disputes off the ice and erupting violence abruped the series before it was finished.

The Black Hawks and Remparts series was intense on many levels. Besides the strong rivalry between Anglophone and Francophone hockey teams and Canadian citizens in general, there was unfinished business between Marcel Dionne and the Remparts coach Maurice Filion. Dionne had been coached by Filion in 1968 as a member of the Drummondville Rangers of the Quebec Junior Hockey League. When the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League formed in 1969, Dionne departed to play in the OHA, which was seen as a higher-calibre level of competition, to hone his skills. Filion vowed revenge against his OHA team. This rivalry was further fueled by the desire of Francophone nationalists to have a Canadian champion from a Quebec team in a Quebec-based league.

The Remparts won the first game 4-2 played in St. Catharines and televised by closed circuit to over 8,000 spectators in Quebec arenas. Despite the win, Filion complained about the referee bias against his players, calling it anti-Francophone. The Black Hawks won game 2 by a score of 8–3, to tie the series at 1 game each.

Game 3 was played in the Colisée de Québec to an overflow crowd, seeing the Remparts win 3–1. There were a total of 102 penalty minutes called, 77 of those were against the Black Hawks. Brian MacKenize of St. Catharines would be suspended for one game after confronting a linesman.

The next game of the series was uglier than the last game. Another overflow crowd saw the Remparts win game 4 by a score of 6–1. As the game wore on, more and more fights broke out on the ice, involving players leaving the penalty box to join the fray. The St. Catharines players were escorted off the ice by police amidst the hurling of debris from Quebec fans. After the game an angry mob surrounded the St. Catharines team bus on its way to the motel, and was given a police escort to safety. The mob circled the motel until the early hours of the morning.

Game 5 was played on neutral ice at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, which the Black Hawks won 6–3 to narrow the series 3 games to 2 for Quebec. That was the last game played.

The parents of the St. Catharines players refused to send their children back to Quebec City for fear of the violence that occurred after game four. The Remparts refused to play anywhere else but their home rink, including any neutral ice in the province of Quebec. The problem was further confounded with threats surfacing from the FLQ (Front de libération du Québec) against St. Catharines players.

CAHA president Dawson declared the series to be over when no further compromise could be reached, and he had received official notice from St. Catharines that the team would not return to the Colisée. As a result, the Remparts went on to compete for the Memorial Cup by default, which they won, defeating the Edmonton Oil Kings.

===Memorial Cup 1974===
In the 1974 Memorial Cup tournament the Black Hawks would square up against the Regina Pats and a rematch versus the Quebec Remparts. St. Catharines was undefeated through the OHA playoffs to reach the Memorial Cup, eliminating the Oshawa Generals, Toronto Marlboros and Peterborough Petes in the process, with a tie against Peterborough in the finals being the only blemish on their record.

The entire cup series would be played in Calgary, Alberta at the Stampede Corral. This venue was much to the liking of St. Catharines players, who were not wanting to relive the Quebec City experience from 3 years ago. St. Catharines played a strong defensive game to open the tournament, getting some vengeance from three years ago. However, the Remparts scored 5 power play goals in the semi-final game and trounced the Black Hawks 11–3.
The Black Hawks played two more seasons in the city, but uprooted and moved to nearby Niagara Falls at the end of the 1975–76 season, becoming the second incarnation of the Niagara Falls Flyers.

==Players==
Two future Hockey Hall of Famers played for the St. Catharines Black Hawks. They are: two time OHA scoring champion Marcel Dionne (1968–71) and Mike Gartner in his rookie year (1975–76) before the team moved to Niagara Falls. In total 61 St. Catharines Black Hawks Alumni graduated to the NHL.

<text>The North Bay Centennials were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League, who played from 1982–2002. The team was based in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
The North Bay Centennials or &quot;Cents&quot; as they were popularly known, were named after the 100th anniversary of the railroad in North Bay. The team came to the city in 1982 after the new owners of the Niagara Falls Flyers failed to get a deal for a new arena, and chose to relocate to North Bay which already had an adequate facility in operation.

The team can trace its roots back to St. Catharines, Ontario, where it played from 1943–1976, as the Falcons, Teepees and Black Hawks, winning the Memorial Cup in 1954 and 1960.

The Centennials won back-to-back Emms division titles in 1986 and 1987. In 1987 the OHL organized a Super Series for the right to host the Memorial Cup tournament between the Leyden Division champions Oshawa Generals, and the Emms Division champions North Bay Centennials. The super series was played while the first round of the playoffs was taking place (at the time, regular season division champions would receive a bye and advance to the second round of the postseason). North Bay came within one game of hosting the national junior championship, losing game seven to the Oshawa Generals. In the OHL championship series that year the Centennials and Generals faced off again with the same result, Oshawa defeating North Bay 4 games to 3. Since the Oshawa Generals were both host and champion, a revision to the Memorial Cup format was made where it was reduced to a three team tournament and the North Bay Centennials eliminated. It was the first three team tournament since 1982 and to this day it is the last 3-team tournament.

Determined to return to the Memorial Cup, coach and general manager Bert Templeton began building his team for another championship run. In 1991–92 North Bay would return to the OHL finals, losing to their northern counterparts, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in seven games. Templeton was awarded the OHL Executive of the Year for the 1991–92 season.

Two years later in 1994, North Bay was on top of the league winning the Hamilton Spectator Trophy. They entered the playoffs as the #1 ranked junior team in Canada. This time the Centennials would prevail in the finals by defeating the Detroit Junior Red Wings in seven games. Injuries began to take their toll on the team as they headed to the 1994 Memorial Cup, played in Laval, Quebec. North Bay dropped all three games on the round-robin; losing 5-4 to the Laval Titan, 3-1 to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, and 5-1 to the Kamloops Blazers.

Templeton was awarded the Ontario Hockey League and Canadian Hockey League Coach of the Year in 1994. He asked for a raise in renegotiating his contract. When the raise was not given, Templeton and the Centennials parted ways.
After Bert Templeton was let go, the Centennials fell on hard times with many losing seasons. The Cents never regained their previous form and attendance dropped off yearly.

For the 1999–2000 season, the Centennials released new uniforms with an updated logo to boost retail sales. However, profits were still declining. Combined with an aging facility, the team became unprofitable and was ultimately sold to a group of American investors in 2002, and moved to Saginaw, Michigan to become the Saginaw Spirit.

The community of North Bay went nine years without the OHL until 2012, when the Brampton Battalion announced they were relocating to the city, keeping the Battalion moniker for the franchise.

==Championships==
The Centennials best year was 1994, when the team was first overall in the regular season, won the league championship and made the trip to the national championship. North Bay also won three division titles, and made three trips to the OHL championship series.

==Coaches==
In twenty years of operation, the North Bay Centennials had four coaches. The legendary Bert Templeton carried over from Niagara Falls and guided the team for its first twelve years in North Bay. He later became the team&#x27;s general manager in addition to coaching. He was awarded the OHL Executive of the Year for the 1991–92 season.

When the Centennials won the championship in 1994, Templeton was awarded the Matt Leyden Trophy as OHL Coach of the Year, and the CHL Coach of the Year Award. He asked for a raise in renegotiating his contract. Failing which, Templeton and the Centennials parted ways.

Shane Parker took over for two and a half seasons, replaced by Greg Bignell for a year and a half. Mike Kelly coached the last four years. He resigned when the team departed North Bay.

==Uniforms and logos==

The North Bay Centennials logo from 1982 to 1999 used the Centennials name and four wheels to form the shape of a locomotive engine. Home jerseys were white with black and gold trim. Away jerseys were black with white and gold trim. North Bay later wore a third jersey with a gold background with black and white trim. Shoulder patches featured a front view of a locomotive on tracks.

The Centennials new logo from 1999 to 2002 was an angry hockey stick wielding railroad engineer above the name of the team. Home jerseys were white with black and gold trim. Away jerseys were black with white and gold trim. The new jerseys had the previous main logo as shoulder patches.

==Arena==
The Centennials played their home games at the North Bay Memorial Gardens. The Gardens was built in 1955 and currently is home to the North Bay Battalion, and also hosted the 1998 OHL All-Star game.

<text>Aerial firefighting, also known as waterbombing, is the use of aircraft and other aerial resources to combat wildfires. The types of aircraft used include fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, delivered to the fire by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing aircraft, or rappelling from helicopters. Chemicals used to fight fires may include water, water enhancers such as foams and gels, and specially formulated fire retardants such as Phos-Chek.

==Terminology==
The idea of fighting forest fires from the air dates back at least as far as Friedrich Karl von Koenig-Warthausen&#x27;s observations on seeing a blaze when overflying the Santa Lucia Range, California, in 1929.

A wide variety of terminology has been used in the popular media for the aircraft (and methods) used in aerial firefighting. The terms airtanker or air tanker generally refer to fixed-wing aircraft based in the United States; &quot;airtanker&quot; is used in official documentation. The term &quot;waterbomber&quot; is used in some Canadian government documents for the same class of vehicles, though it sometimes has a connotation of amphibians.

Air attack is an industry term used for the actual application of aerial resources, both fixed-wing and rotorcraft, on a fire. Within the industry, though, &quot;air attack&quot; may also refer to the supervisor in the air (usually in a fixed-wing aircraft) who supervises the process of attacking the wildfire from the air, including fixed-wing airtankers, helicopters, and any other aviation resources assigned to the fire. The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS), often called &quot;air attack&quot;, is usually flying at an altitude above other resources assigned to the fire, often in a fixed-wing plane but occasionally (depending on assigned resources or the availability of qualified personnel) in a helicopter.

Depending on the size, location, and assessed potential of the wildfire, the &quot;air attack&quot; or ATGS person may be charged with initial attack (the first response of firefighting assets on fire suppression), or with extended attack, the ongoing response to and management of a major wildfire requiring additional resources including engines, ground crews, and other aviation personnel and aircraft needed to control the fire and establish control lines or firelines ahead of the wildfire.

== Equipment ==
A wide variety of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are used for aerial firefighting. In 2003, it was reported that &quot;The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management own, lease, or contract for nearly 1,000 aircraft each fire season, with annual expenditures in excess of US$250 million in recent years&quot;.

===Helicopters===

Helicopters may be fitted with tanks (helitankers) or they may carry buckets. Some helitankers, such as the Erickson AirCrane, are also outfitted with a front-mounted foam cannon. Buckets are usually filled by submerging or dipping them in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. The most popular of the buckets is the flexible Bambi Bucket. Tanks can be filled on the ground (by water tenders or truck-mounted systems) or water can be siphoned from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or a portable tank through a hanging snorkel. Popular firefighting helicopters include variants of the Bell UH-1H Super Huey, Bell 204, Bell 205, Bell 212, Boeing Vertol 107, Boeing Vertol 234, Sikorsky S-70 &quot;Firehawk&quot; and the Sikorsky S-64 Aircrane helitanker, which features a snorkel for filling from a natural or man-made water source while in hover. Currently the world&#x27;s largest helicopter, the Mil Mi-26, uses a Bambi bucket.

===Water and fire retardant bombers===



&quot;Airtankers&quot; or &quot;water bombers&quot; are fixed-wing aircraft fitted with tanks that can be filled on the ground at an air tanker base or, in the case of flying boats and amphibious aircraft, by skimming water from lakes, reservoirs, or large rivers without needing to land.

Various aircraft have been used over the years for firefighting. In 1947, the United States Air Force and United States Forest Service experimented with military aircraft dropping water-filled bombs. The bombs were unsuccessful, and the use of internal water tanks was adopted instead. 

The Mendocino Air Tanker Squad formed by Joseph Bolles Ely in 1956 was the first such unit in the United States to drop water and retardant on fires. Based at the Willows-Glenn County Airport it soon led the way for other agencies to form similar squads.

Though World War II- and Korean War-era bombers were for a long time the mainstay of the aerial firefighting fleet, newer purpose-built tankers have since come online. The smallest are the Single Engine Air Tankers (SEATs). These are agricultural sprayers that generally drop about of water or retardant. Examples include the Air Tractor AT-802, which can deliver around 800 gallons of water or fire retardant solution in each drop, and the Soviet Antonov An-2 biplane. Both of these aircraft can be fitted with floats that scoop water from the surface of a body of water. Similar in configuration to the World War II–era Consolidated PBY Catalina, the Canadair CL-215 and its derivative the CL-415 are designed and built specifically for firefighting. The Croatian Air Force uses six CL-415s as well as six AT 802s for firefighting purposes.

Medium-sized modified aircraft include the Grumman S-2 Tracker (retrofitted with turboprop engines as the S-2T) as used by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), as well as the Conair Firecat version developed and used by Conair Group Inc. of Canada, while the Douglas DC-4, the Douglas DC-7, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the Lockheed P-2 Neptune, and the Lockheed P-3 Orion – and its commercial equivalent, the L-188 Electra – have been used as air tankers. Conair also converted a number of Convair 580 and Fokker F27 Friendship turboprop airliners to air tankers.

The largest aerial firefighter ever used is a Boeing 747 aerial firefighter, known as the Global Supertanker, that can carry fed by a pressurized drop system. The Supertanker was deployed operationally for the first time in 2009, fighting a fire in Spain. The tanker made its first American operation on August 31, 2009, at the Oak Glen Fire. It has since been replaced by a Boeing 747-400. Another wide body jetliner that is currently being used as an air tanker is the modified McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 operated by the 10 Tanker Air Carrier company as the DC-10 Air Tanker. It can carry up to of fire fighting retardant.

The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations operates convertible-to-cargo Ilyushin Il-76 airtankers that have been operating with tanking systems, and several Beriev Be-200 jet powered amphibian aircraft. The Be-200 can carry a maximum payload of about of water, making &quot;scoops&quot; in suitable stretches of water in 14 seconds.

Bombardier&#x27;s Dash 8 Q Series aircraft are the basis of new, next-generation air tankers. Cascade Aerospace has converted two pre-owned Q400s to act as part-time water bomber and part-time transport aircraft for France&#x27;s Sécurité Civile, while Neptune Aviation is converting a pre-owned Q300 as a prototype to augment its Lockheed P-2 Neptune aircraft. The Sécurité Civile also operates twelve Canadair CL-415 and nine Conair Turbo Firecat aircraft. Neptune Aviation also currently operates converted British Aerospace 146 jetliners as air tankers. The BAe 146 can carry up to 3,000 gallons of fire fighting retardant. Air Spray USA Ltd. of Chico, California has also converted the BAe 146 jetliner to the role of air tanker. Another modern-era passenger aircraft that has now been converted for aerial firefighting missions in the U.S. is the McDonnell Douglas MD-87 jetliner operated by Erickson Aero Tanker. The MD-87 can carry up to 4,000 gallons of fire fighting retardant. Coulson Aviation unveiled a Boeing 737-300 firefighting conversion in May 2017. Six aircraft have been purchased from Southwest Airlines for the RADS system conversion which was planned to enter service in December 2017. The 737 aircraft is smaller than the C-130Q which allows for a wider range of airfields to be utilized. Britt Coulson further stated the aircraft will be able to retain the current seat and galley configuration for tanker operations. On 22 November 2018, the 737 was used for the first time to fight a fire near Newcastle, Australia.

In July 2022, Airbus tested the aerial firefighting capacity of the A400M using a roll-on/roll-off kit comprising a 20-tonne water tank and piping allowing the load to be expelled from the end of the cargo ramp.

Other former military aircraft utilized as firefighting air tankers in the U.S. in the past included the B-17 and the PB4Y-2, a version of the B-24.

===Leadplanes===
The Lead Plane function directs the activities of the airtankers by both verbal target descriptions and by physically leading the airtankers on the drop run. The leadplane is typically referred to as a &quot;Bird Dog&quot; in Canada or &quot;Supervision&quot; aircraft in Australia. The O-2 Skymaster, Cessna 310 and OV-10 Bronco have been used as spotter and lead plane platforms. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has also used the Cessna 337. The Beechcraft Baron was long used as a leadplane or air attack ship, but most were retired in 2003; more common now is the Beechcraft King Air and the Twin Commander 690. A Cessna Citation 500 jet owned by Air Spray (1967) LTd. was used by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests beginning in 1995 and used for two fire seasons to lead the very fast Electra L188 air tanker to the fires. This was the first time a jet aircraft was used as a lead plane or &quot;bird dog&quot;. The Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia operates a fleet of nine American Champion Scouts 8GCBC during the summer months as spotter aircraft and Air Attack platforms. The Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the Yukon Territories contract to supply Twin Commander 690 as bird dog aircraft for their air tanker fleets. Air Spray owns 9 Twin Commander 690 for use as bird dog aircraft.

===Fleet grounding===
In the United States, most of these aircraft are privately owned and contracted to government agencies, and the National Guard and the U.S. Marines also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft. On May 10, 2004, The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy airtankers. They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting crash of a C-130A Hercules in California and a PB4Y-2 in Colorado during the summer of 2002. Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic fatigue cracks at the wing roots. After subsequent third-party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy airtankers, three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft.

==Fire retardant==
Borate salts used in the past to fight wildfires have been found to sterilize the soil and be toxic to animals so are now prohibited. Newer retardants use ammonium sulfate or ammonium polyphosphate with attapulgite clay thickener or diammonium phosphate with a guar gum derivative thickener. Fire retardants often contain wetting agents, preservatives and rust inhibitors and are colored red with ferric oxide or fugitive color to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include Fortress and Phos-Chek.

Some water-dropping aircraft carry tanks of a guar gum derivative to thicken the water and reduce runoff.

==Tactics and capabilities==

Helicopters can hover over the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has microprocessor-controlled doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate the efforts of the smoke jumper, helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft, while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the trajectory for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.

Water is not usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are not typically used to extinguish the fire, but instead are used to contain the fire, or slow it down to allow ground crews to contain it. Because of this, retardants are usually dropped in front of or around a moving fire, rather than directly on it, creating a firebreak.

Aerial firefighting is most effectively used in conjunction with ground-based efforts, as aircraft are only one weapon in the firefighting arsenal. However, there have been cases of aircraft extinguishing fires long before ground crews were able to reach them.

Some firefighting aircraft can refill their tanks in mid-flight, by flying down to skim the surface of large bodies of water. One example is the Bombardier CL-415. This is particularly useful in rural areas where flying back to an airbase for refills may take too much time. In 2002 an Ontario CL-415 crew was able to refill 100 times within a 4-hour mission, delivering or of water on a fire near Dryden, Ontario (June 1, 2002 Dryden fire # 10 Tanker #271 civil ident C-GOGE).

<doc id="1143981" wikidata="Q2980681" url="?curid=1143981" title="Electrostatic lens">
<text>An electrostatic lens is a device that assists in the transport of charged particles. For instance, it can guide electrons emitted from a sample to an electron analyzer, analogous to the way an optical lens assists in the transport of light in an optical instrument. Systems of electrostatic lenses can be designed in the same way as optical lenses, so electrostatic lenses easily magnify or converge the electron trajectories. An electrostatic lens can also be used to focus an ion beam, for example to make a microbeam for irradiating individual cells.

==Cylinder lens==

A cylinder lens consists of several cylinders whose sides are thin walls. Each cylinder lines up parallel to the optical axis into which electrons enter. There are small gaps put between the cylinders. When each cylinder has a different voltage, the gap between the cylinders works as a lens. The magnification is able to be changed by choosing different voltage combinations. Although the magnification of two cylinder lenses can be changed, the focal point is also changed by this operation. Three cylinder lenses achieve the change of the magnification while holding the object and image positions because there are two gaps that work as lenses. Although the voltages have to change depending on the electron kinetic energy, the voltage ratio is kept constant when the optical parameters are not changed.

While a charged particle is in an electric field force acts upon it. The faster the particle the smaller the accumulated impulse. For a collimated beam the focal length is given as the initial impulse divided by the accumulated (perpendicular) impulse by the lens. This makes the focal length of a single lens a function of the second order of the speed of the charged particle. Single lenses as known from photonics are not easily available for electrons.

The cylinder lens consists of defocusing lens, a focusing lens and a second defocusing lens, with the sum of their refractive powers being zero. But because there is some distance between the lenses, the electron makes three turns and hits the focusing lens at a position farther away from the axis and so travels through a field with greater strength. This indirectness leads to the fact that the resulting refractive power is the square of the refractive power of a single lens.

==Einzel lens==

An einzel lens is an electrostatic lens that focuses without changing the energy of the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular tubes in series along an axis.

==Quadrupole lens==
The quadrupole lens consists of two single quadrupoles turned 90° with respect to each other. Let z be the optical axis then one can deduce separately for the x and the y axis that the refractive power is again the square of the refractive power of a single lens.

A magnetic quadrupole works very similar to an electric quadrupole, however the Lorentz force increases with the velocity of the charged particle. In spirit of a Wien filter, a combined magnetic, electric quadrupole is achromatic around a given velocity. Bohr and Pauli claim that this lens leads to aberration when applied to ions with spin (in the sense of chromatic aberration), but not when applied to electrons which also have a spin. See Stern–Gerlach experiment.

==Magnetic lens==
A magnetic field can also be used to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and to the direction of the magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest magnetic lens is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field, an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil and gets weaker moving away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an electrostatic lens, the paths in a magnetic lens contain a spiraling component, i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a magnetic lens is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an electrostatic lens. 
The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other magnetically soft material) magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses.

==Multipole lenses==
Multipoles beyond the quadrupole can correct for spherical aberration and in particle accelerators the dipole bending magnets are really composed of a large number of elements with different superpositions of multipoles.

Usually the dependency is given for the kinetic energy itself depending on the power of the velocity.
So for an electrostatic lens the focal length varies with the second power of the kinetic energy,
while for a magnetostatic lens the focal length varies proportional to the kinetic energy.
And a combined quadrupole can be achromatic around a given energy.

If a distribution of particles with different kinetic energies is accelerated by a longitudinal electric field, the relative energy spread is reduced leading to less chromatic error. An example of this is in the electron microscope.

==Electron spectroscopy==
The recent development of electron spectroscopy makes it possible to reveal the electronic structures of molecules. Although this is mainly accomplished by electron analysers, electrostatic lenses also play a significant role in the development of electron spectroscopy.

Since electron spectroscopy detects several physical phenomena from the electrons emitted from samples, it is necessary to transport the electrons to the electron analyser. Electrostatic lenses satisfy the general properties of lenses.

<doc id="1144000" wikidata="Q5530389" url="?curid=1144000" title="Gelbison">
<text>Gelbison were an Australian pop rock band formed in 2000 by Pete Farley on bass guitar, Dave Galafassi on drums, Edo Kahn on vocals and guitar, and his brother Nadav Kahn on vocals and keyboards. The Kahn brothers were also members of Nations by the River (2003–04). Gelbison released two studio albums, &quot;1704&quot; (7 April 2003) and &quot;See the World&quot; (8 November 2004), and disbanded in 2007.

== History ==

Gelbison were formed in 2000 in Sydney by Pete Farley on bass guitar, horns and backing vocals; Dave Galafassi on drums; Edo Kahn on vocals and guitar; and his brother, Nadav Kahn, on vocals, harp and keyboards. Their first gig was at the Hollywood Hotel, Surry Hills attended by Ian Ball (Gomez); Nadav recalled, &quot;We did meet [Ball] before [Gelbison formally] started. Edo and I met him in Bondi on a night out when [Gomez] were on their second tour in Australia and we connected on one very drunken night. Everyone ended up at my place, jamming until about six in the morning. So there was a musical and human connection. We somehow maintained contact.&quot;

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;1704&quot;, produced by Ball, was released on 7 April 2003 via Virgin Records and EMI Music Group Australia. It peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart. Greg Lawrence of Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online (WHAMMO) felt it was &quot;a work of understated genius. Having Ian Ball from Gomez co-producing certainly helps but the compositions, the arrangements and the sentiment communicated throughout Gelbison’s debut LP is virtually faultless and much more than clever guidance from an established artist/producer.&quot; Tim Cashmere of Undercover opined that &quot;imagine if the out there factor could be multiplied by a thousand or so. That is one hell of a mellow album you&#x27;ve got there and local Sydney outfit Gelbison&#x27;s major label debut is it.&quot;

Ahead of the album they issued their debut single, &quot;Metal Detector&quot; (October 2002), which Lawrence noticed &quot;made an impact on radio regardless of dynamic, manic riffing that seemed to challenge the listener.&quot; Cashmere described it as one of the album&#x27;s &quot;moments when the group gathered up the energy to head down to 7-11 and instead channeled it into tracks like &#x27;Metal Detector&#x27;.&quot; The following single, &quot;Homelands&quot; (February 2003), shows &quot;a gentle flow but still contains imaginative garnishes and experimental textures.&quot; A third single, &quot;Good God&quot;, followed the album in May. Farley described that track, &quot;I didn’t write the lyrics for that one but, for me, I get a sense of hope in that song, hoping for something that you haven’t got but you long for. I think there’s a real sense of longing in that song.&quot; Galafassi had married Australian actress-singer, Toni Collette, in January that year. Collette directed the music video for &quot;Good God&quot;.

Early in 2003 Gelbison were touring in support of the Sleepy Jackson, when Edo Kahn and Luke Steele (of the Sleepy Jackson) started jamming together one evening: they decided to create a side project, Nations by the River as an alt-country band. The pair were soon joined by Nadav and later by Ohad Rein; they issued their debut album, &quot;Holes in the Valley&quot;, in June 2004.

Gelbison&#x27;s second album, &quot;See the World&quot;, was released on 8 November 2004, Ball returned for production duties, along with Ben Frost and Gelbison. Galafassi had left the group, while the remaining trio had started song writing in &quot;a shack in Jarvis bay for [a] month writing period. In this time we compiled all our existing songs and wrote new songs and tried to decide on the best direction to take the record.&quot; They used Hamish Stewart to provide drums for about 30 demo versions. Frost used Pro Tools &quot;and started hacking at the beats sometimes speeding them up/slowing them down where we felt appropriate and re-appropriating fills and hits amongst the songs.&quot; Ball &quot;helped rework the song arrangements and structure and we tried to finish up all the tunes over the next three weeks in the studio. In this time we got in seven other drummers, as the need arose.&quot;

The album featured a number artists, Ball, Rein, Steel and Ben Lee. It peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart. A number of tracks, including, &quot;All the Rage&quot; and &quot;Holy&quot;, received significant rotation on Triple J. In the first week of December, Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, declared &quot;See the World&quot; to be his Feature Album of the Week, &quot;the voice of John Lennon&#x27;s solo work, the gentle pop power of the Go-Betweens and the beautifully crafted sonic attack of Radiohead and Gomez rolled into one. This is an incredibly accomplished and confident piece of work. Song after song is a gem. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that people don&#x27;t write good songs anymore.&quot;

By January 2006 Farley and Galafassi were members of Toni Collette &amp; the Finish, a pop music group. The remaining Gelbison members severed ties with EMI in 2006 and worked on their third album towards the end of that year with J Walker aka Machine Translations as producer. After recording they returned to the studio and recorded a new range of songs with producer, Tony Buchen. Edo and Nadav Kahn decided to disband Gelbison and provided new material as the Kahn Brothers, with their debut album, &quot;Love Melts Fear&quot;, released in April 2007 through Shakti/Interia Records.

<doc id="1144003" wikidata="Q2603341" url="?curid=1144003" title="BE (Pain of Salvation album)">
<text>BE is the fifth studio album by Swedish band Pain of Salvation, released via InsideOutMusic in September 2004. It is a concept album focusing on the existence of God and humankind. Along with the band it features a nine-part orchestra, &quot;The Orchestra of Eternity&quot;, which features prominently throughout the album. It is the last album to feature Kristoffer Gildenlöw on bass and is the first Pain of Salvation album to be divided into more than three chapters.

The band performed it live as a rock opera. It was released as &quot;&quot;BE&quot; (Original Stage Production)&quot;.

==Outline==
&quot;BE&quot; attempts to explore the many facets of human existence. It begins with the narration of Animae, someone or something who/that has existed for as long as they/it can remember and contemplate the nature of their/its existence and then begins a journey of understanding with the words: &quot;I will call myself &quot;GOD&quot; and I will spend the rest of forever trying to figure out who I am&quot;. The story continues from there. The characters that appear and disappear throughout the story are as follows:

*Animae: Animae is the album&#x27;s representation of God, or a Godhead.
*Nauticus: Nauticus is the name of a fictional space probe that is, according to the album, the most intelligent space probe ever to be created. In reference to the marine &#x27;neighborhood&#x27;, Nauticus &#x27;drifts&#x27; throughout space, searching for answers to save Earth from itself.
*Imago: Imago is the image of humanity in its most natural form. Combined, Imago is the reflection of Animae.
*Dea Pecuniae: Dea Pecuniae can be seen as a feminine version of Mr. Money, and the Eve of humanity&#x27;s dark side. In a way, she represents sin.
*Mr. Money: Mr. Money is the main character of the story; a man with the most wealth on Earth, who spends most of it on cryogenics in order to fulfill his wish - to be frozen, and not to be awakened until he is made immortal. He represents the darker side of humanity, being the Adam for Dea Pecuniae.

The sound and style are somewhat more varied than previous Pain of Salvation albums, but at the same time, calling upon those previous albums as influences. The album includes: narrative passages; a folk-like song; a gospel-prayer-like song; a church-hymn-like song; progressive metal songs; a classical piano/strings piece; a conversation with a radio in the background; news readings; and even a song that would not be out of place in a Broadway musical. Another song consists entirely of voice messages to be left on &quot;God&#x27;s answering machine&quot;. To approach this song, the band asks the subscribers of their newsletter to call a certain phone number and say what ever they would want to say to God.

In writing &quot;BE&quot;, Daniel Gildenlöw used many resources for information, insights and inspiration. These are intended as &quot;points of departure&quot; for listeners to continue their &quot;own journey through &quot;BE&quot; &quot;.

<text>Sir William Mackenzie (October 17, 1849 – December 5, 1923) was a Canadian railway contractor and entrepreneur.

Born near Peterborough, Canada West (now Ontario), Mackenzie became a teacher and politician before entering business as the owner of a sawmill and gristmill in Kirkfield, Ontario. He entered the railway business as a contractor under civil engineer James Ross, working on projects in Ontario, British Columbia, Maine, and the North-West Territories (present-day Saskatchewan and Alberta) between 1874 and 1891.

In partnership with his mentor James Ross, Mackenzie became owner of the Toronto Street Railway (precursor to the Toronto Transit Commission) in 1891 and in 1899, helped found the precursor to Brazilian Traction, for which he was the first chairman. In 1895, together with Donald Mann, Mackenzie began to purchase or build rail lines in the Canadian prairies, which would form the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a company that would stretch from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton Island and form Canada&#x27;s second transcontinental railway system. He started Pat Burns&#x27; career by giving him a series of contracts for provisioning food for the railway contract. Burns would go on to build one of the World&#x27;s largest meat empires.

Mackenzie and Mann were knighted in 1911 for their efforts in the railway industry, but personal and company financial difficulties led to the bankruptcy of the CNoR. The system was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918, and subsequently became part of the Canadian National Railway.

Mackenzie died in Toronto, Ontario. He was inducted into Ottawa&#x27;s Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 along with partner Mann.

<doc id="1144021" wikidata="Q1764622" url="?curid=1144021" title="Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in E-flat minor, Op. 1">
<text>Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in E-flat minor, Op. 1 is the eleventh studio album by guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, released on 4 February 1998 through Canyon International. The album was Malmsteen&#x27;s first attempt at a classical concerto suite featuring electric guitar solos. All of the music was composed by Malmsteen, though his compositions were scored by his friend and fellow musician David Rosenthal. The music is conducted by Yoel Levi, and performed by the Czech Philharmonic.

Malmsteen has been keen to emphasize that unlike other collaborations between rock musicians and classical orchestras (such as Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;), which feature a rock group playing with orchestral accompaniment, this is orchestral music which happens to have an electric guitar as its solo instrument. He has acknowledged that in many of the pieces he had to overdub his guitar solos in order to make them &quot;fit&quot;. However, the entire piece has since been performed live in Japan with the New Japan Philharmonic and is available as a DVD release.

The current population is approximately 600. It is at an elevation of approximately 1600 m (5300 feet) above sea level.

==History==

The 99-year lease for the at Ukarumpa was signed by Dick Pittman, accompanied by founding Director, Dr. James C. (&quot;Jim&quot;) Dean for the Summer Institute of Linguistics on 4 October 1956. Jim Dean was the founding Director of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in the (then) United Nations mandated Australian Trust Territory of New Guinea and remained as Director until he was reassigned to establish the S.I.L. operations in India in the mid-1960s.

The had been the Peacock Plantation, a failed commercial venture. Before that, however, it was a plot of land that was used as the tribal war lands of the nearby tribes (and traditional enemies), the Gadsup and Tairora. Because the land was vacant in the mid-1950s, and only a portion of it, near the Ba&#x27;e river, was suitable for gardens, the Australian administrators offered it as one of several potential sites for the SIL base of operations.

Originally the land was open &quot;kunai&quot; (a type of waist-high grass with sharp-edged leaves) with few trees and no development. The members built homes and planted trees which continue to attract bird life. Most of the buildings and roads were built by missionary volunteers with financial support from churches and individuals in their home countries. 

The function of Ukarumpa is to serve as an operations base for translators, linguists, literacy specialists, teachers and other professionals, who are mainly volunteer workers with SIL. SIL International is an organisation that places a strong emphasis on linguistic research and Bible translation.

==Geography==

Ukarumpa is located on the Ba&#x27;e River. The Ba&#x27;e originates upstream from Ukarumpa and runs through the Gadsup area on to Kainantu. It lies at an altitude of approximately . The climate is Equatorial Highland; there are cool days and nights, with daily afternoon rains between November and March.

The flora are primarily evergreen trees (Pine, Eucalyptus, Casuarina); there are also coffee plantations nearby, and kunai grass-covered hills.

==Airfield==
The settlement has its own air strip, Aiyura Airport, home to a fleet of STOL aircraft operated by SIL.

<text>Sir Donald Daniel Mann (March 23, 1853 – November 10, 1934), who was also referred to as &quot;Dan&quot; or &quot;D.D.&quot; before his knighthood, was a Canadian railway contractor and entrepreneur.

==Biography==
Born at Acton, Canada West, Mann studied as a Methodist minister but worked in lumber camps in Parry Sound District and Michigan for eight years before moving to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1879. During the 1880s he worked as a contractor for the Canadian Pacific Railway under James Ross and Herbert Samuel Holt, building sections of rail across the prairies and through the Rocky Mountains.

Partnering with William Mackenzie in 1886, Mann built railway lines in Western Canada, Maine, and Chile. They also went to China to pursue opportunities, but found the red tape there too great an obstacle to overcome. While there, he was challenged to a duel by a Russian count, who later withdrew when Mann advised him that he would choose to use the broadaxe, claiming it to be Canada&#x27;s national weapon.

By 1895, the effects of the CPR monopoly on freight rates in Western Canada, together with its refusal to build branch lines into the northern prairie, prompted Clifford Sifton to offer federal bond guarantees to any other enterprise that wished to construct railways there. Mackenzie and Mann took up the offer, and began the process of purchasing and building such lines. They would later be consolidated in 1898 to become the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a line which would stretch from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to Montreal, with other unconnected lines as far east as Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, which would form Canada&#x27;s second transcontinental railway system. The CNoR would be the first railway to reach Edmonton, Alberta, and the full line was completed in 1915, upon the driving of the last spike in Basque, British Columbia. In recognition of their contributions to the development of Canada&#x27;s railways, both Mann and Mackenzie were knighted in 1911.

Financial difficulties eventually resulted in the insolvency of the CNoR. It was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918, and became the Canadian National Railway.

Mann developed other business opportunities on his own, which included coal mines and a related railway in Inverness County, Nova Scotia, the Winnipeg Street Railway, and multiple public utilities in Monterrey, Mexico.

Mann turned to oil drilling. He leased land in the Township of Vaughan, near the village of Concord, and sank a well in November 1922. In the spring of 1928, instead of oil, he found mineral water. Under the name Ontario Mineral Waters Ltd. he bottled and sold it as a health tonic named &quot;Raysol Radium Water&quot; effective against a variety of ailments including diabetes, angina, tuberculosis and rheumatism. $1 a bottle or $3 a gallon. The venture failed ostensibly because the water was very salty.

Mann died in 1934 at the age of 81, and was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Acton.

==Legacy==
In 1969, a park was named for Sir Donald Mann in Acton, Ontario, the land of which once formed part of the farm on which he grew up. It is adjacent to the CNR track, and not far away from the former right of way once occupied by the Toronto Suburban Railway controlled by Mackenzie and Mann.

He, along with Mackenzie, was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002.

He is also known for the Mann Cup, the trophy awarded to the senior men&#x27;s lacrosse champions of Canada. The cup is made of solid gold, and it was donated in 1910.

<text>The Kharoti (Pashto:خروٹی) خروټی) are a Pashtun tribe of Ghilji origin, originating in the central part of Paktika Province, Afghanistan, but can be also found in other parts of the country. The Kharoti settled in Kharotabad in Quetta, British India (now Pakistan) around 1945.

There are large Kharoti populations in the Paktika districts of Urgun, Barmal, Sar Hawza, Zarghun Shahr, Omna, Surobi, and in Ghazni, Zabul, Paktia, Khost, Logar, Wardak, Kabul, Nangarhar, Helmand, Gomal, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan and Quetta.

==Significance==
As Pashtuns of the Ghilji confederacy, the heyday of the Kharotis was during the peak of the Khāns of the Nasher-Nashir family. With the rise of the rival Durrani confederacy in the 18th century, the Kharoti lost their leading role in Afghan politics but remained strong in rural Afghan regions. However, they often view themselves as the &quot;true Pashtuns&quot; and, being Ghilji, as the rightful leaders of Afghanistan.

==Notable Kharoti’s==

* Hafizullah Amin, president of Afghanistan and organiser of the Saur Revolution
* Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Politician, Afghan warfare leader during soviet union occupation, ( Hizb-e-Islami Chairman) and former Prime minister

<text>The long-billed pipit or brown rock pipit (Anthus similis) is a passerine bird which has a wide distribution. A number of subspecies have been created for the populations in Africa, through the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia. The systematics of this complex is yet to be clarified. Most birds are residents or short distance migrants.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This is a complex group with several similar looking birds with very disjunct distributions and the exact patterns of phylogeny are yet to be determined. Several subspecies that were formerly placed within this species have been raised to full species status.

The wood pipit (&quot;Anthus nyassae&quot;), an inhabitant of miombo woodland in south-central Africa, was formerly treated as a subspecies of this bird but is now usually regarded as a separate species. Some authorities also split Bannerman&#x27;s pipit (&quot;Anthus (similis) bannermani&quot;), a bird of mountain grassland in West Africa. The Nicholson&#x27;s pipit is a recently split non-migratory species from southern Africa.

The nominate race was described by Thomas C. Jerdon in 1840 from peninsular India. This form occurs along the Western Ghats and into the Nilgiris and Palni Hills. A darker race &quot;travancoriensis&quot; was described by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1953 for the form possibly restricted south of the Palghat Gap. Subspecies &quot;decaptus&quot; described by Richard Meinertzhagen is found in Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northwestern India, while &quot;jerdoni&quot; is found along the Himalayan foothills east to Nepal. The population &quot;yamethini&quot; is somewhat disjunct and found in Myanmar. Several other races are described in the West Asian region and from Africa.

==Description==
This is a medium-large pipit, 16–17.5 cm long, but is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly sandy grey above and whitish or pale buff below. It is very similar to the tawny pipit, but is slightly larger, has a longer tail and a longer dark bill.

The long-billed pipit&#x27;s flight is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic &quot;chupp&quot; call, similar to desert lark. Its song is like that of the tawny pipit, but slower and more varied, &quot;sri...churr...sri...churr…sri..churr&quot;. Like its relatives, long-billed pipit eats seeds and insects.

The long-billed pipit&#x27;s breeding habitat is dry open slopes with rocks and low vegetation. The nest is on the ground, with 2-4 eggs being laid.

<text>Kenneth Neal Waltz (; June 8, 1924 – May 12, 2013) was an American political scientist who was a member of the faculty at both the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University and one of the most prominent scholars in the field of international relations. He was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War.

Waltz was one of the original founders of neorealism, or structural realism, in international relations theory and later became associated with the school of defensive neorealism. Waltz&#x27;s theories have been extensively debated within the field of international relations. His 1979 book &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; is the most assigned book in International Relations graduate training at U.S. universities.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Waltz was born on June 8, 1924, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He grew up and attended high school there. He then attended Oberlin College, where he started out majoring in mathematics. That was interrupted to serve in the United States Army from 1944 to 1946 during World War II, when he rose in rank from private to first lieutenant. Waltz served in the Pacific theater of the war and was stationed in Japan during the U.S. occupation of Japan.

He graduated from Oberlin with an A.B. degree in 1948, having switched his major to economics. He was a Phi Beta Kappa and also named an Amos Miller Scholar.

In 1949, he married Helen Elizabeth Lindsley, known as &quot;Huddie&quot;. They had three children together. After attending Columbia University to obtain an upper graduate degree in economics, he switched to political science because political philosophy was more interesting to him. He received his M.A. degree from there in 1950. He was an instructor at Oberlin for a while in 1950. A member of the US Army Reserve, he was called upon to serve again during the Korean War, which he did during 1951–52 as a first lieutenant.

Returning to Columbia, he obtained his Ph.D. under William T. R. Fox in 1954. During his PhD studies, Waltz was most interested in political theory, but gravitated towards international relations due to the academic job market and the pressure of his dissertation advisor. While preparing for his comprehensive exams, Waltz came up with the ideas that would ultimately become his dissertation and his 1959 book &quot;Man, the State and War&quot;.

==Academic career==
Waltz became a lecturer and then assistant professor at Columbia from 1953 to 1957. He became one of the early group of scholars at Columbia&#x27;s Institute of War and Peace Studies and acted as a research assistant from 1952 to 1954 and a research associate from 1954. Later saying that he and his wife had been unsettled by the prospect of raising small children in New York City, Waltz left Columbia for Swarthmore College, where he was an assistant professor and then a professor from 1957 to 1966. He then moved on to Brandeis University for a stint from 1966 to 1971, the last four years of which he held the Adlai E. Stevenson Professor of International Politics chair.

In 1971, Waltz joined University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed the Ford Professor of Political Science. Meanwhile, Waltz held a number of additional research positions. He was affiliated with the Institute of War and Peace Studies until 1964. He was a fellow of Columbia University in Political Theory and International Relations from 1959 to 1960 in London. He was a research associate at Center for International Affairs at Harvard University in 1963 to 1964, 1968, 1969, and 1972. He held a National Science Foundation grant from 1968 to 1971 to develop a theory of international politics. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for 1976 to 1977 and a fellow at the Institute for the Study of World Politics in 1977. He was a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in 1979–1980. He then became a research associate with the Department of War Studies, King&#x27;s College London. Waltz taught at Peking University for two months in 1982, and he later taught at Fudan University as well. He lectured at a number of institutions in the US, including the Air Force Academy, the National War College, the Army War College, and the Naval War College. Similarly, he lectured at many other institutions around the world, including the London School of Economics, the Australian National University, and the University of Bologna. Waltz served as an instructor at MIT Seminar XXI.

Waltz retired from his position at Berkeley and returned to Columbia University in 1997. There, he became an adjunct professor as well as a senior research scholar at the Institute of War and Peace Studies.

Waltz served as Secretary of the American Political Science Association in 1966 to 1967 and then as its president in 1987 to 1988. He was President of the New England Section of the International Studies Association in 1966 to 1967. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and served stints on the boards of editors of several scholarly journals. He has described Hans Morgenthau as a strong influence on his work.

===Levels of analysis===
Waltz&#x27;s initial contribution to the field of international relations was his influential 1959 book, &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot;. It classified theories of the causes of war into three categories, or levels of analysis. He referred to those levels of analysis as &quot;images&quot; and used the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image was given two chapters: the first used the classical philosopher&#x27;s writings mainly to describe what that image says about the cause of war, and the second usually had Waltz analyze the strengths and weaknesses of that image. Waltz&#x27;s wife was essential in contributing the research that became the basis for the book.

The first image argued that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders, like Napoleon, or by human nature more generally. That is basically consistent with classical realism, which then dominated the international relations discipline, but Waltz would contest it more fully in his next book, &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;.

Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz&#x27;s second image contended that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz referred to is Lenin&#x27;s theory of imperialism, which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for capitalist states to continue opening up new markets in order to perpetuate their economic system at home. Today, a more familiar example in the Western world is the notion that nondemocratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars.

Waltz next assessed the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image but as ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of war. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level and the anarchic structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In that context, &quot;anarchy&quot; was defined not as a condition of chaos or disorder but one in which no sovereign body governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. In other words, in domestic society, citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, but if a state is invaded and calls &quot;9-1-1,&quot; it cannot be sure that anyone will answer.

Similarly, when two citizens have a dispute, they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court&#x27;s ruling. However, there is no body above nation-states that can establish rules or laws for all the states, decide how they apply in specific cases, and compel the states to honor the court&#x27;s ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its power to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that any state can resort to armed force anytime forces each state to be always prepared for that contingency.

Those themes were fleshed out more fully in &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;, which, as the title suggests, explained a theory for international politics as a whole, rather than the narrower focus on what causes war.

===Neorealism===
Waltz&#x27;s key contribution to the realm of political science is in the creation of neorealism (or &quot;structural realism&quot;, as he calls it), a theory of international relations that posits that the interaction of sovereign states can be explained by the pressures exerted on them by the anarchic structure of the international system, which limits and constrains their choices. Neorealism thus aims to explain recurring patterns in international relations, such as why relations between Sparta and Athens resembled those between the United States and the Soviet Union in some important ways.

Waltz emphasizes repeatedly in the book and elsewhere that he is not creating a theory of foreign policy, which aims to explain the behavior or actions of a particular state at a specific time or throughout a period. For Waltz, neorealism is divided into two branches: defensive and offensive neorealism. Although both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete for power, defensive realism posits that most states seek a status quo and limit themselves to concentrate on maintaining the balance of power. Revisionist states are said to be the only states that seek to alter the balance. Offensive neorealism, in contrast to Waltz, asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states.

Waltz argues that contemporary geopolitics exists in a state of international affairs comparable to that of perpetual international anarchy. He distinguishes the anarchy of the international environment from the order of the domestic one. In the domestic realm, all actors may appeal to and be compelled by a central authority, &quot;the state&quot; or &quot;the government,&quot; but in the international realm, no such source of order exists. The anarchy of international politics, with its lack of a central enforcer, means that states must act in a way that ensures their security above all, or they otherwise risk falling behind. He wrote that this international anarchy is a fundamental fact of political life faced by democracies and dictatorships alike. Except in rare cases, they cannot count on the good will of others to help them and so they must always be ready to fend for themselves. Waltz&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;anarchy&quot; led to a fundamental discursive transformation in international relations, as scholars wrestled with Waltz&#x27;s ideas. A 2015 study by Jack Donnelly found that the term &quot;anarchy&quot; occurred on average 6.9 times in international relations books prior to 1979 but 35.5 times in those afterward.

Like most other neorealists, Waltz accepted that globalization poses new challenges to states, but he did not believe that states are being replaced because no other non-state actor can equal the capabilities of the state. Waltz suggested that globalization is a fad of the 1990s, and if anything, the role of the state has expanded its functions in response to global transformations.

Neorealism was Waltz&#x27;s response to what he saw as the deficiencies of classical realism. Although both terms are sometimes used interchangeably, neorealism and realism have a number of fundamental differences. The main distinction between the two theories is that classical realism puts human nature, or the urge to dominate, at the center of its explanation for war, but neorealism stakes a reduced claim on human nature and argues instead that the pressures of anarchy tend to shape outcomes more directly than the human nature of statesmen and diplomats or domestic governmental preferences.

Waltz&#x27;s theory, as he explicitly states in &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;, is not a theory of foreign policy and does not attempt to predict specific state actions, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union. The theory explains only general principles of behavior that govern relations between states in an anarchic international system, rather than specific actions. The recurring principles of behavior include balancing of power (the theory was refined by Stephen Walt, who modified the &quot;balance of power&quot; concept to &quot;balance of threat&quot;), entering individually-competitive arms races, and exercising restraint in proportion to relative power. In &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; (1979:6) Waltz suggested that explanation, rather than prediction, is expected from a good social science theory since social scientists cannot run the controlled experiments that give the natural sciences so much predictive power.

As a teacher, Waltz trained numerous prominent international relations scholars, including Stephen Walt, Barry Posen, Stephen Van Evera, Bob Powell, Avery Goldstein, Christopher Layne, Benny Miller, Karen Adams, Shibley Telhami, James Fearon, William Rose, Robert Gallucci, and Andrew Hanami. He influenced Robert Jervis and Robert Art.

Columbia University colleague Robert Jervis has said of Waltz, &quot;Almost everything he has written challenges the consensus that prevailed at the time&quot; and &quot;Even when you disagree, he moves your thinking ahead.&quot; Leslie H. Gelb has considered Waltz one of the &quot;giants&quot; who helped define the field of international relations as an academic discipline.

===Review===
*In &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot;, Waltz proposes a three-images view of looking at international relations behavior. The first image was the individual and human nature; the second image the nation-state, and the third image the international system.
*In &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;, Waltz elaborates many of the core principles of neorealist international relations theory, adopting a structural perspective that sets him apart from earlier (classical) realists like E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau, and later giving rise to the Neoclassical realist movement (Randall Schweller, Fareed Zakaria, William C. Wohlforth, Thomas J. Christensen, etc.) which tries to incorporate a structural component while emphasizing the state-society relationship that mitigates structural forces. (This book also popularized the term bandwagoning.)
*In &quot;The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed&quot;, Waltz argues for the virtues of a world with more nuclear weapon states because of their power in nuclear deterrence. Sagan argued against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. See nuclear peace.

==Awards and honors==
Waltz received the Heinz Eulau Award in 1991 for Best Article in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; during 1990 for &quot;Nuclear Myths and Political Realities&quot;.
He received the James Madison Award for &quot;distinguished scholarly contributions to political science&quot; from the American Political Science Association in 1999.
The International Studies Association in 2010 named him their International Security Studies Section Distinguished Scholar.

In 2008, a conference in Waltz&#x27;s honor was conducted by Aberystwyth University, titled &quot;The King of Thought: Theory, the Subject and Waltz&quot;. It celebrated the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot; and the 30th anniversary of &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;.

Waltz received honorary doctorates from Copenhagen University, Oberlin College, Nankai University, and Aberystwyth University, as well as from the University of Macedonia (Greece).

<doc id="1144062" wikidata="Q6220377" url="?curid=1144062" title="John Baker (biologist)">
<text>John Randal Baker FRS (23 October 1900 – 8 June 1984) was an English biologist, zoologist, and microscopist, and a professor at the University of Oxford, where he was Emeritus Reader in Cytology. He received his D.Phil. at the University of Oxford in 1927.

== Early life ==
Baker was the youngest of five children born to Rear Admiral Julian Alleyne Baker and his wife Geraldine Eugenie (née Alison). He was a grandson of General Sir Archibald Alison and among the papers collected in Baker&#x27;s name at the Bodleian Library are volumes of correspondence and other material related to Alison&#x27;s military service during the Indian Mutiny, Ashanti Campaign, and Egyptian Campaign of 1882.

Born in Woodbridge, Baker grew up in a country home near Bromyard. At age ten, he was sent to Boxgrove School, near Guildford. Due to World War I, his schooling there was cut short and he joined the Bournemouth School of Flying at age sixteen. Though he achieved a pilot&#x27;s certificate, he was excluded from the Royal Flying Corps due to inadequate eyesight and thereafter joined the Oxford University Officers&#x27; Training Corps.

Upon war&#x27;s end, Baker entered Oxford&#x27;s New College, where he studied zoology. Among the small staff of the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy was Dr. (later Sir) Julian Huxley, of whom Baker would write a biographical memoir many years later. Other students in the department during Baker&#x27;s time included Charles Elton, E. B. Ford, Alister Hardy and Carlos Blacker. Baker became the captain of New College&#x27;s rowing team and completed his B.A. with first class honours in 1922, partially on the basis of his microscopical investigation of spermatogenesis in crickets.

== Expeditions ==
Baker participated in several overseas research expeditions following his undergraduate work. An anthropological and zoological mission headed by Professor T. T. Barnard in 1922 provided the first of three visits to the New Hebrides Islands, where Baker turned his attention to the influence of a relatively non-seasonal climate on the breeding seasons and sexual activity of animals. He also became interested in the hermaphroditic pigs bred by the native people for use in rituals of initiation and, later, in comparing them with the intersex pigs of Britain. Examination of the anatomical and histological characteristics of these animals, in conjunction with research into factors of sex determination and development of sexual organs, led to his book &quot;Sex in man and animals&quot; (1926).

In 1927, Baker returned to the New Hebrides for a year. On this trip, his study of the native population and interest in reproduction became focused on questions of human population control, about the growth of which he and many others had become concerned. His research in this area would eleven years later issue in the development of the contraceptive spermicide Volpar and, for this work, he would in 1958 receive the Oliver Bird Medal from the Family Planning Association. Interestingly, Baker&#x27;s great-grandfather, Sir Archibald Alison, had in 1840 published a book titled &quot;The principles of population&quot;.

In 1933, under the auspices of the Oxford University Exploration Club founded by his schoolmate Charles Elton, Baker organized and led the Oxford Expedition to the New Hebrides, the primary focus of which was to investigate the influence of environmental factors on the breeding seasons of rainforest fauna. Additional purposes included specimen collection and surveying. The company included his wife Inezita and sister Geraldine - who had collaborated with him on previous research, ornithologist Tom Harrisson, zoologist and surveyor Terence Bird, and naturalist A. J. Marshall. One of the expedition&#x27;s accomplishments was the first ascent and mapping of Mount Tabwemasana, the highest peak in the New Hebrides. The resultant map was used by the U.S. Army during their World War II occupation of the islands.

==Work==
The most widely received of his works was &quot;Race&quot; (1974). Uncharacteristically for the time, Baker used the traditional categories of physical anthropology and classified human populations in terms of race.

Baker rejected the methodological relativism that had characterized anthropology since the days of Franz Boas, instead going back to earlier ideas of hereditarianism and cultural evolution. The book received mixed reviews.

In &quot;Race&quot;, Baker used a restrictive sense of the term &quot;civilization&quot;, giving 21 criteria by which civilizations might be identified. Based on these criteria, Baker declared that Mesoamerican societies such as those of the Aztecs and Maya were not civilizations, and that no indigenous civilizations ever arose in Africa. He enumerated five civilizations (Sumerian, ancient Egyptian, Helladic-Minoan, Indus Valley, and Sinic) &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and explored the relationship between the biological traits and the cultures of these five civilizations. In this book, Baker speculated that different human races evolved from different subspecies of apes (known as polygenism). Baker claimed that &quot;negrids&quot; were less evolved, and also inferior, to races Baker described as civilized. Baker also quotes Long&#x27;s claim that black people have a &quot;fetid smell&quot;. According to a 1974 review by A. O. Ladimeji in &quot;Race &amp; Class&quot;, Baker misrepresents or misunderstands the history of the study of race. Per Ladimeji, &quot;Most of Baker&#x27;s biological data comes from the nineteenth century with no corroboration from recent research.&quot; Ladimeji wrote that most of Baker&#x27;s more outlandish claims had already been refuted by available studies at the time of publication.

Together with Michael Polanyi, Baker founded the Society for Freedom in Science in 1940. In March, 1958 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

<text>Motor Ace are an Australian alternative rock band. Formed in Melbourne around 1998 out of the remains of another band named Snowblind, their members are Patrick &quot;Patch&quot; Robertson (vocals/guitar), Damian Birchall Costin (drums), Matt Balfe (bass), and Dave Ong (guitar).

== History ==
=== 1998–2000: Early history ===
Motor Ace began recording their debut release, a self-titled EP, during April 1999. They worked with producer Paul McKercher, who had previously worked with bands such as You Am I and The Cruel Sea. Along with 28 Days, Machine Gun Fellatio, and NoKTuRNL, they were part of a collection of young Australian acts signed to Festival Mushroom Records&#x27; development label Sputnik, which launched in 1999. The eventual track listing of their self-titled release included &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot;, &quot;Chromakey&quot;, &quot;Criminal Past&quot;, &quot;Lowrider&quot;, and &quot;Fluke&quot;. Triple J gave the band heavy airplay, assisting the band on their touring schedule. Afterwards, the singles &quot;Death Defy&quot; (which was later used as the title theme for TV show &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;), &quot;American Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Hey Driver&quot; were released throughout the course of 2000. Some of them charted in the top 100 of the ARIAnet singles chart, while also gaining popularity on Triple J.

===2001–2004: &quot;Five Star Laundry&quot; and &quot;Shoot This&quot;===
Motor Ace&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Five Star Laundry&quot;, was released in March 2001. It was produced and engineered by Craig Harnath and Chris Dickie in February 2000 at Melbourne&#x27;s Sing Sing Studios. Due to a heatwave at the time, the nearby power stations had been shut down, and the band were forced to record across the four-week period without air conditioning. During this time, Robertson also lost his voice. According to the band, vocals for the album were completed at 2am on the day both Robertson and Costin were due to fly to London to mix the album with Chris Sheldon, who had previously worked with the Foo Fighters and Therapy?. The album entered the Australian ARIA Chart at number 4.

Motor Ace&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Shoot This&quot; was released in July 2002. The album debuted at number 1 that year and was certified gold. Two singles, &quot;Carry On&quot; and &quot;Keeping Secrets&quot; reached the top 30 in the ARIA Chart.

Motor Ace were put on hold after their 2003 Japanese shows for &quot;Shoot This&quot;, after the pressuring touring and work schedule was beginning to take its toll on the band – particularly Robertson, who suffers from Crohn&#x27;s disease. During this period, Costin started a music management group, Fat Guy Management (FGM), while Robertson retreated to his home in Fitzroy and began to develop his songwriting and production techniques. Ong, meanwhile, put together a country-influenced solo album under the name Joni Lightning. Towards the end of this hiatus, the band&#x27;s management denied that they had split up.

===2005: &quot;Animal&quot; and break-up===
Preceded by first single &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Gone&quot; in May 2005, the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Animal&quot; was released in August 2005. A second single, &quot;A Little Closer&quot;, was released on 12 September 2005. &quot;Animal&quot; peaked at number 21 on the ARIA Charts.

In September 2005, Motor Ace announced that they would officially disband by the year&#x27;s end, playing farewell shows in Melbourne and Perth during December.

===2006–2017: Post break-up===
The individual members remained on amicable terms in the following years. Robertson worked professionally scoring for film and television, and also began working with Aesop. Ong still occasionally performed around Melbourne with his Joni Lightning project, before picking up work on an oil rig. Costin continued to work in the music industry, eventually founding the company 123 Agency. Balfe went on to play guitar in Melbourne band Five Mile Sniper, and also works for Yarra Valley Water. Both Robertson and Costin were also a part of the band Nighthawk, which formed in 2016.

===2018: Reunion===
In August 2018, it was announced that Robertson, Ong, Costin and Balfe would reunite as Motor Ace for a headlining tour in March and April 2019. The band also announced the release of both &quot;Five Star Laundry&quot; and &quot;Shoot This&quot; on vinyl, as well as releasing a compilation entitled &quot;B-Sides &amp; Demos&quot; online.

In March 2022, Motor Ace released &quot;Knock Knock&quot;, their first single in 17 Years.

<text>Banyan is an art rock/alternative rock band with heavy jazz and funk influence based in Los Angeles, California.

== History ==
The leader and co-founder is Stephen Perkins, who first played drums for Jane&#x27;s Addiction (1986–1991, plus later regroupings), and then for Porno for Pyros. He co-founded the group with Emit Bloch. The core members of the band are Nels Cline on guitar, Willie Waldman on trumpet and Mike Watt (Minutemen) on bass. Watt also sings on some Banyan songs. Both Watt and Cline generally play only West Coast dates and at various times the band has had Rob Wasserman and Daniel Shulman who played with Garbage on bass and Clint Wagner on guitar fill in when they are unavailable. Saxophone players Steve Mackay and Herman Green, guitar player Calvin Newborn, Dave Aron on clarinet, and bass player J. D. Westmoreland have also joined the band during select live shows.

Los Angeles artist Norton Wisdom paints on a wet-erase board while the band plays, and the imagery he creates interprets the music much in the same way that lyrics might. To see the band in more than one performance, you will see some images that recur and some that are new, since the songs are compositions whose structure remains the same while there is also a large amount of improvisation, in the jazz tradition.

The first EP featured Money Mark as keyboardist labeled as the &quot;Freeway Keyboardist&quot;. The first album was engineered by the Dust Brothers at their studio and produced by Turin and Perkins.

Notable guest appearances on the second album &quot;Anytime at All&quot; include Flea, John Frusciante (both from the Red Hot Chili Peppers), Martyn LeNoble (Perkins&#x27; former bandmate from Porno for Pyros), Rob Wasserman and Buckethead. It was produced by Dave Aron (Producer/Engineer/Mixer of Snoopdogg, Sublime and moe.) and Willie Waldman as the Blunt Brothers.

For their third album &quot;Live At Perkins&#x27; Palace&quot; (named after the fact that it was recorded at Perkins&#x27; home studio, not after the live performance venue of the same name), the band reduced itself to a four-piece unit of Perkins, Watt, Cline, and Waldman.

Steve Kimock sat in with Banyan during their August 26, 2007 performance at the Riverview Music Festival in Chicago.

In liner notes and personal conversations, members of the band cite Igor Stravinsky and Miles Davis as influences.

<text>Nancy Ilizabeth Lieberman (born July 1, 1958), nicknamed &quot;Lady Magic&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player and coach in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) who is currently a broadcaster for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) as well as the head coach of Power, a team in the BIG3 which she led to its 2018 Championship. Lieberman is regarded as one of the greatest figures in American women&#x27;s basketball.

In 2000, she was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. Lieberman is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame, the St. Louis Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Lieberman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Jerome and Renee Lieberman. She is Jewish (and described herself as &quot;just a poor, skinny, redheaded Jewish girl from Queens&quot;). Her family lived in Brooklyn when she was born, but soon moved to Far Rockaway, Queens, where she grew up with her older brother Clifford. She lost great-grandparents in the Holocaust, and her paternal grandparents, who survived, had concentration camp numbers on their wrists.

Her mother brought up the children after a separation and divorce. While growing up, she was interested in a variety of sports, playing baseball, softball and football with boys, before settling on basketball as her primary sport. She played basketball primarily on pickup teams with boys, not playing on a girls&#x27; team until she was a high school sophomore.

Lieberman&#x27;s mother Renee was not supportive of her daughter&#x27;s interest in basketball. Once, when Lieberman was practicing dribbling techniques indoors because it was cold outside, her mother demanded she stop dribbling because of all the noise. When she did not stop, her mother punctured the basketball with a screwdriver. Lieberman found another ball and continued, but her mother punctured that one as well. This continued until five balls were ruined. Lieberman then decided she had better go outside before she ran out of basketballs.

==Playing career==
===High school career===
While attending Far Rockaway High School in Queens, she established herself as one of the top women&#x27;s basketball players in the country by earning one of the 12 coveted slots on the USA&#x27;s National Team. In 1975, while still in her teens, Lieberman was named to the USA Team designated to play in the World Championships and Pan American Games, where the team won a gold medal.

During the school year, she played for her high school team, but in the summer, played with an Amateur Athletic Union team in Harlem, the New York Chuckles.

She told former Knick Walt Frazier that he was her hero and that it was because of him that she wore No. 10, saying: &quot;You might not even know this, but you thought you were affecting young guys but you were affecting young, white Jewish women, not just boys.&quot;

===College career===
Lieberman originally was a verbal commitment to Canisius University before being heavily recruited by Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, where she attended from 1976 to 1980 and played on the women&#x27;s basketball team there. During that time, she and her team won two consecutive AIAW National Championships (1979, 1980) and one WNIT (Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament) Championship in 1978. She was the first two-time winner of the prestigious Wade Trophy, a national player of the year award in college women&#x27;s basketball, and was selected as the Broderick Award winner for basketball as the top women&#x27;s player in America. Lieberman also won three consecutive Kodak All-America awards (1978, &#x27;79, &#x27;80). Lieberman was one of six young adults to win the Young American Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 1980.

Lieberman earned the nickname &quot;Lady Magic,&quot; a nod to Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson of NBA fame. Lieberman set a school record for career assists (961) that still stands today. She led the team in assists each of the four years she was on the team—in her sophomore year she averaged 8.9 per game. Lieberman amassed 2,430 points along with 1,167 rebounds in her collegiate career, producing an average of 18.1 points per game. Lieberman achieved a triple double (40 points, 15 rebounds, 11 assists) against Norfolk State in her sophomore year. Lieberman stole the ball 562 times and assisted a basket 961 times in her college career, believed to be modern records. She is the holder of several single-game and single-season records, including best free-throw shooting percentage in her freshman and sophomore years.

Lieberman earned her degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from Old Dominion University on May 6, 1980. She was inducted into the ODU Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.

===Professional career===

In 1980 she was selected with the first pick in the Women&#x27;s Pro Basketball League (WBL) draft by the Dallas Diamonds. She helped Dallas to the 1981 WBL finals, where they lost to the Nebraska Wranglers in five games. She was named the &quot;rookie of the year&quot;, after averaging 26.3 points per game. Lieberman&#x27;s WBL career is featured in the book &quot;Mad Seasons: The Story of the First Women&#x27;s Professional Basketball League, 1978–1981&quot;.

In 1981, she played for the Los Angeles Lakers Summer Pro League team.

In 1984, she once again suited up for the Dallas Diamonds, signing a three-year, $250,000 contract with the team to play in the Women&#x27;s American Basketball Association (WABA). Averaging 27 points per game and voted the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, she helped Dallas win the 1984 WABA championship, but the league folded after the season. The final game played was between the Diamonds and the WABA All-Stars, where Lieberman scored 19 points and was named the game&#x27;s MVP in the Diamonds&#x27; 101–94 victory.

In 1986, Lieberman signed with the Springfield Fame of the men&#x27;s professional United States Basketball League (USBL) where she went on to average 1.7 points in 11 minutes per game. She remained in the league the following season, playing for the Long Island Knights. Later, she toured with the Washington Generals, who served as the regular opponent of the Harlem Globetrotters, where she met her future husband, teammate Tim Cline.

She was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 1996 and to the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.

In the newly formed WNBA&#x27;s inaugural year in 1997, Lieberman played for the Phoenix Mercury. At the age of 39, she was the WNBA&#x27;s oldest player. On July 24, 2008, at 50 years old, Lieberman signed a seven-day contract with the eventual WNBA Champion Detroit Shock, breaking her own previous record as the oldest player in league history and returning to the franchise she coached a decade prior.

That same day, the Shock played a game against the Houston Comets where Lieberman saw playing time. Lieberman recorded two assists in nine minutes of playing time, but Detroit lost the game 79–61. This ended up being her final WNBA game, as she was waived the next day on July 25, 2008.

===National team career===
At age 17, Lieberman was named to the USA Basketball team roster. She played for the team in the 1975 USA Women&#x27;s Pan American Team, three years younger than the next youngest teammates. The games were held in Mexico City, Mexico in October. The Pan Am team had failed to win the gold in 1967 and 1971. In 1975, the team was more successful, compiling a 7–0 record, and winning the gold medal for the first time since 1963.

Lieberman continued with the USA team to the 1976 Olympics in Montreal in the first women&#x27;s Olympic basketball team competition. Shortly after turning 18, Lieberman became the youngest basketball player in Olympic history to win a medal, when the United States captured the silver medal.

Lieberman was named to the team representing the US at the 1979 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei. The USA team won all six games on the way to the gold medal. Lieberman earned a spot on the Jones Cup All-Tournament Team

Lieberman played with the team at the 1979 Pan American games in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Although the team easily won most of their games, they lost to Cuba, 91–86, and received the silver medal.

In 1980, Lieberman earned a slot on the 1980 Olympic team, but withdrew from the squad in support of U.S. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. She failed to make the final roster for the 1990 Goodwill Games and the 1992 Olympics.

==Coaching career==
===WNBA===
In 1998, Lieberman was hired as general manager and head coach of the Detroit Shock. She coached for three seasons, leading the team to a winning record (17–13) in their inaugural season. After being fired after the 2000 season, Lieberman worked as a women&#x27;s basketball analyst for ESPN.

===NBA G League===
In November 2009, Lieberman became the coach of the Texas Legends in the NBA Development League (now NBA G League), an affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks, thus becoming the first woman to coach a professional men&#x27;s basketball team. The team began play in November 2010. She later moved to a front office position with the Legends before joining Fox Sports Oklahoma as an analyst for the Oklahoma City Thunder studio show, &quot;Thunder Live&quot;.

===NBA===
In July 2015, she was hired by the Sacramento Kings as an assistant coach, becoming the second female assistant coach in NBA history. She took two leaves of absence to care for her ailing mother before leaving the Kings in 2017. After the Kings, she became a broadcaster with the New Orleans Pelicans.

===BIG3===
On March 21, 2018, it was announced that Lieberman was hired as a head coach of Power in the BIG3 league, replacing Clyde Drexler. In her first season as head coach, she led her team to the 2018 Championship, defeating 3&#x27;s Company to become the first ever female coach in the BIG3 to win a championship.

==Personal life==
Lieberman lived with tennis star Martina Navratilova for several years beginning in 1981 and she also served as her physical trainer, contributing to Navratilova&#x27;s return to the number one ranking in 1982.

In 1988, Lieberman married one of her teammates with the Generals, Tim Cline, taking the surname Lieberman-Cline until the couple&#x27;s divorce on March 15, 2001.
Their son T. J. Cline played college basketball for the Richmond Spiders, and in November 2017 signed to play for Israeli team Hapoel Holon, which plays in the Ligat HaAl, the top division of Israeli basketball.

In regard to religious matters, despite her Jewish upbringing, Lieberman became a Christian late in her life and was described as having embraced born-again Christianity in a 2015 &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; article. Nonetheless, she said in an interview in 2010, &quot;I am 100% Jewish. My father&#x27;s parents were deeply religious, we had two sets of silverware when we went and ate over there. My mother&#x27;s side observed the major holidays. It was more relaxed.

<doc id="1144080" wikidata="Q691385" url="?curid=1144080" title="Giovanni Battista Guadagnini">
<text>Giovanni Battista Guadagnini (often shortened to G. B. Guadagnini; 23 June 1711 – 18 September 1786) was an Italian luthier, regarded as one of the finest craftsmen of string instruments in history. He is widely considered the third greatest maker after Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri &quot;del Gesù&quot;. The Guadagnini family was known for their violins, guitars and mandolins.

==Biography==
Giovanni Battista Guadagnini was born on 23 June 1711, in the hamlet of Bilegno, in what is now the Province of Piacenza in Northern Italy. Both his life and his career can be divided into four distinct periods, which correspond to the four cities in which he would live and work, Piacenza, Milan, Parma, and Turin.
Almost nothing is known about his early years until he moved to the nearby city of Piacenza in 1738. In 1742, his first violins start to appear. It is unclear from whom or where he learned his trade. Since he joined the woodworking guild, it is likely that he underwent an apprenticeship with a local woodworker; however, there is no evidence of any local instrument makers in Piacenza at the time.

In 1749 Guadagnini moved to Milan, where he continued to make instruments. The reason for his move is unknown, but was perhaps economically motivated as Milan was a much larger city with a larger and more active music scene. During this time a few of his instruments bear labels implying a relationship to Cremona—the home of the renowned violin makers Amati, Stradivari, and Guarneri—however no evidence exists that Guadagnini ever lived in Cremona.

In 1758 Guadagnini moved again, this time to Parma. He may have been drawn to the city by the recent appointment of Carlo Ferarri, a close musician friend from his time in Piacenza, to a position with the Ducal Court. During his time in Parma Guadagnini was also closely connected to the court, and in particular to the musical patronage of the Prime Minister Guillaume du Tillot. In his later years in Parma Guadagnini even received a direct salary from the court. In 1771, with the Court&#x27;s financial fortunes in decline, Guadagnini asked to be allowed to leave.

He next moved to Turin. Two years later, in 1773, he began his historically important relationship with notable violin collector Count Cozio. Cozio purchased most, if not all, of Guadagnini&#x27;s output during this time, and also supplied him with most of his wood and other materials. His business partnership with Cozio ended in 1777, though they continued to have dealings with each other. The Count is likely responsible for Guadagnini&#x27;s marked shift to a more Stradivari-like style during this time, both by pressuring Guadagnini to more closely copy Stradivari and by providing Guadagnini with access to examples of Stradivari&#x27;s work.

Giovanni Battista Guadagnini passed away in Turin on 18 September 1786.

== Violin maker ==
Guadagnini&#x27;s work is divided into four distinct periods, which correspond to the four cities in which he worked over the span of his career, Piacenza, Milan, Parma, and Turin. His work in each new city changed in response to the availability of materials, the needs of the local musicians, and finally in Turin, his relationship with Count Cozio. Stylistically Guadagnini&#x27;s work is generally less refined and polished than that of makers such as the Amatis or Stradivari, however with the same focus on tonal success. He is generally considered to be the last of the great historical makers, ranking just behind Stradivari and Guarneri. He is also possibly the last of historical makers to have used a varnish similar to what was used by classical Cremonese makers.

His instruments have sold for over $2,000,000 at auction.

<text>The Lepcha (; also called Rongkup (Lepcha: ᰕᰫ་ᰊᰪᰰ་ᰆᰧᰶ ᰛᰩᰵ་ᰀᰪᰱ ᰛᰪᰮ་ᰀᰪᰱ, &quot;Mútuncí Róngkup Rumkup&quot;, &quot;beloved children of the Róng and of God&quot;) and Rongpa (Sikkimese: )) are among the indigenous people of the Indian state of Sikkim and Nepal, and number around 80,000. Many Lepcha are also found in western and southwestern Bhutan, Darjeeling, the Koshi Province of eastern Nepal, and in the hills of West Bengal. The Lepcha people are composed of four main distinct communities: the Renjóngmú of Sikkim; the Dámsángmú of Kalimpong, Kurseong, and Mirik; the ʔilámmú of Ilam District, Nepal; and the Promú of Samtse and Chukha in southwestern Bhutan.

== Origins ==

Lepchas are said to have migrated from Cambodia and Tibet having a similar culture, dressup, traits and history. They speak a Tibeto-Burman language which some classify as Himalayish. Others suggest a more complex migration, a migration to Cambodia, then a navigation of the Ayeyarwady River and Chindwin Rivers, a crossing of the Patkoi range coming back west, and finally entering ancient India; this idea is supported by Austroasiatic language substrata in their vocabularies). While migrating westward through India, they are surmised to have passed through southern Bhutan before reaching their final destination near Kanchenjunga. The Lepcha people themselves do not have any tradition of migration, and hence they conclude that they are autochthonous to the region, currently falling under the state of Sikkim, Darjeeling District of West Bengal, eastern Nepal and the southwestern parts of Bhutan. In the Province No. 1, they form 7% of the population of Ilam District, 2% in Panchthar District, and 10% of the population in Taplejung District. In Sikkim as a whole they are considered to be around 15% of the population of the state.

The Lepcha people were earlier ruled by Pano (King) Gaeboo Achyok. Gaeboo Achyok was instrumental in uniting the Lepcha people and to honour him, the Lepcha people celebrate 20 December of every year as Gaeboo Achyok celebrations day. Gaeboo Achyok extended the Lepcha kingdom from Bhutan in the east to Ilam (Nepal) in the west and from Sikkim to the northern tips of present-day Bangladesh.

== Language ==
The Lepcha have their own language, also called Lepcha. It belongs to the Bodish–Himalayish group of Tibeto-Burman languages. The Lepcha write their language in their own script, called &quot;Róng&quot; or Lepcha script, which is derived from the Tibetan script. It was developed between the 17th and 18th centuries, possibly by a Lepcha scholar named Thikúng Munsulóng, during the reign of the third Chogyal (Tibetan king) of Sikkim.

== Clans ==
Lepchas are divided into many clans (Lepcha: &quot;putsho&quot;), each of which reveres its own sacred lake and mountain peak (Lepcha: &quot;dâ&quot; and &quot;cú&quot;) from which the clan derives its name. While most Lepcha can identify their own clan, Lepcha clan names can be quite formidable, and are often shortened for this reason. For example, &quot;Nāmchumú&quot;, &quot;Simíkmú&quot;, and &quot;Fonyung Rumsóngmú&quot; may be shortened to &quot;Namchu&quot;, &quot;Simik&quot;, and &quot;Foning&quot;, respectively. Some of the name of the clans are &quot;Zuraboo&quot;, &quot;Barphungputso&quot;, &quot;Rongong&quot;, &quot;Karthakmu&quot;, &quot;Sungutmu&quot;, &quot;Phipon&quot;, &quot;Brimu&quot;, &quot;Lickchingmu &quot;, “Sadamoo”, “Kabomoo”, “Molomoo”, “Lingdamoo” etc.

== Religion ==
Most Lepchas are Buddhists, although a large number of Lepchas have today adopted Christianity. Some Lepchas have not given up their shamanistic religion, which is known as Mun. In practice, rituals from Mun and Buddhism are frequently observed alongside one another among some Lepchas. For example, ancestral mountain peaks are regularly honoured in ceremonies called &quot;tandong lho rumfát.&quot; Many rituals involve local species. In Sikkim, Lepchas are known to use over 370 species of animals, fungi, and plants. According to the Nepal Census of 2001, out of the 3,660 Lepcha in Nepal, 88.80% were Buddhists and 7.62% were Hindus. Many Lepchas in the Hills of Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong are Christians.

== Clothing ==

The traditional clothing for Lepcha women is the ankle-length &quot;dumvun&quot;, also called &quot;dumdyám or gādā&quot; (&quot;female dress&quot;). It is one large piece of smooth cotton or silk, usually of a solid color. When it is worn, it is folded over one shoulder, pinned at the other shoulder, and held in place by a waistband, or &quot;tago&quot;, over which excess material drapes. A contrasting long-sleeved blouse may be worn underneath.

The traditional Lepcha clothing for men is the &quot;thakraw&quot; (&quot;male dress&quot;). It is a multicolored, hand-woven cloth pinned at one shoulder and held in place by a waistband, usually worn over white shirt and trousers. Men wear a flat round cap called a &quot;thyáktuk&quot;, with stiff black velvet sides and a multicolored top topped by a knot similar as the Mongol&#x27;s. Rarely, the traditional cone-shaped bamboo and rattan hats are worn.

== Dwellings (place to stay) ==
Traditionally, the Lepcha live in a local house called a &quot;li&quot;. A traditional home is made out of logs of wood and bamboo and rests around 4 to 5 feet (1.2m to 1.5m) above the ground on stilts. The wooden house with thatched roof is natural air conditioner and eco-friendly. The traditional Lepcha house has no nails used in the construction and it is seismic movement friendly since the weight of the house is rested over a large tablets of stones and not planted on the soil.

== Subsistence ==
The Lepchas are mostly agriculturists. They grow oranges, rice, cardamoms, and other foods.

=== Cuisine ===
Lepcha cuisine is mild and not as spicy as Indian or Nepalese cuisine. Rice is the staple, whole wheat, maize, and buckwheat are also used. Fresh fruit and vegetables are used.
&quot;Khuzom&quot; is a traditional Lepcha bread made from buckwheat, millet, and corn or wheat flour.
Popular Lepcha dishes include &quot;ponguzom &quot;(rice, fish, vegetable grill), &quot;su zom&quot; (baked meat dish), &quot;ihukpa&quot; (noodle, meat, and vegetable stew), and &quot;sorongbeetuluk&quot; (rice and nettle porridge).

An alcoholic beverage called &quot;chi &quot;or &quot;chhaang&quot; is fermented from millet. &quot;Chi&quot; also has religious significance, as it is given as offering to the gods during religious ceremonies.

== Arts, crafts, and music ==
The Lepchas are known for their unique weaving and basketry skills. They have a rich tradition of dances, songs, and folktales. The popular Lepcha folk dances are &quot;Zo-Mal-Lok, Chu-Faat, Tendong Lo Rum Faat&quot;, and &quot;Kinchum-Chu-Bomsa&quot;. Musical instruments used are &quot;sanga&quot; (drum), &quot;yangjey&quot; (string instrument), &quot;fungal, yarka,&quot; flute, and &quot;tungbuk&quot;.
One popular instrument used by the Lepchas is a four-string lute that is played with a bow.

== Marriage customs ==
The Lepcha are largely an endogamous community.

The Lepcha trace their descent patrilineally. The marriage is negotiated between the families of the bride and the groom. If the marriage deal is settled, the &quot;lama&quot; checks the horoscopes of the boy and girl to schedule a favourable date for the wedding. Then the boy&#x27;s maternal uncle, along with other relatives, approaches the girl&#x27;s maternal uncle with a &quot;khada&quot;, a ceremonial scarf, and one rupee, to gain the maternal uncle&#x27;s formal consent.

The wedding takes place at noon on the auspicious day. The groom and his entire family leave for the girl&#x27;s house with some money and other gifts that are handed over to the bride&#x27;s maternal uncle. Upon reaching the destination, the traditional &quot;Nyomchok&quot; ceremony takes place, and the bride&#x27;s father arranges a feast for relatives and friends. This seals the marriage between the couple.

==Lepcha people in Nepal==
The Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal classifies the Lepcha as a subgroup within the broader social group of Mountain/Hill Janajati. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, 3,445 people identified as Lepcha, one in every 7,690 or the total Nepalese population (26,494,504).

<doc id="1144084" wikidata="Q209915" url="?curid=1144084" title="Three Billy Goats Gruff">
<text>&quot;Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot; () is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in their &quot;Norske Folkeeventyr&quot;, first published between 1841 and 1844. It has an Aarne-Thompson type of 122E. The first version of the story in English appeared in George Webbe Dasent&#x27;s translation of some of the &quot;Norske Folkeeventyr&quot;, published as &quot;Popular Tales from the Norse&quot; in 1859. The heroes of the tale are three male goats who need to outsmart a ravenous troll to cross the bridge to their feeding ground.

==Characters==
The story introduces three billy goats (male goats), sometimes identified as a youngster, father and grandfather, but more often described as brothers. In other adaptations, there is a baby or child goat, mama goat and papa goat.

&quot;Gruff&quot; was used as their family name in the earliest English translation by Dasent and this has been perpetuated; but this has been pointed out as a mistranslation of the Norwegian name which was here employed in the sense of &quot;tuft, clump&quot; of hair on the forehead of domesticated livestock. The word can mean &quot;fizz&quot; or &quot;effervescence&quot;, but also a &quot;frizzle (of hair)&quot; according to Brynildsen&#x27;s Norwegian-English dictionary, but the secondary meaning is better explained as &quot;a tuft/clump of hair on a horse (or buck goat)&quot; in the &quot;Great Norwegian Encyclopedia&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), and Ivar Aasen&#x27;s Norwegian-Danish dictionary.

== Plot ==
Three billy goats live in a valley, all named &quot;Gruff&quot;. There is very little grass in the valley, so they must cross a river to get to &quot;Transhumance&quot; (a mountain pasture) to graze and fatten themselves up. But under the bridge lives a fearsome and hideous troll (guarding the bridge) who kills and eats everyone who tries to cross.

The smallest billy goat goes first. The troll stops him and threatens to &quot;gobble him up!&quot; The little goat tells the troll he should wait for his big brother to cross, because he is larger and would make for a more gratifying feast. The greedy troll agrees and lets the smallest goat pass.

Then the medium-sized billy goat approaches the bridge. He is more cautious than his brother, but the troll stops him too. The second goat convinces the troll to wait for their eldest brother, the largest of the three, and the troll lets him pass as well.

Then the largest billy goat steps on to the bridge and meets the troll waiting to devour him. The largest goat challenges him to fight and then throws him into the water with his horns. The troll drowns in the stream, and from then on the bridge is safe. Then the three billy goats are able to use the bridge every day (to go to the meadow and eat grass in the rich fields around the summer farm in the hills), and live happily ever after.

==Retellings==
Writer and illustrator have created three books in Norwegian based on this story. The first, &quot;Bukkene Bruse på badeland&quot; (&quot;The Three Billy Goats Gruff at the Waterpark&quot;), came in 2009 and had by 2014 sold over 110,000 copies in Norway, making it one of the biggest selling picture books in the country. By March 2019, the three books had sold over 450,000 copies in Norway.

Part of the story in the children&#x27;s book The Troll by Julia Donaldson is based on the tale, with a troll that lives under varying bridges and waits for goats but in this story only other animals walk over the bridges.

Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Troll Bridge&quot; (1993) in the anthology &quot;Snow White, Blood Red&quot; is also an adaption of the fairy tale, for adults.

Golden Books did a version of the story that was similar to the book. The only difference is that when the troll is washed away by the stream, he is later mentioned to have moved into a cave.

* The tale also comes into play during the first &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; (1983) game. A troll is guarding a bridge Graham needs to cross. The optimum solution to the puzzle is to lure a goat over to the bridge. Upon seeing the troll, the goat is angered, and butts it into the river below.
* The tale also comes into play during &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot; (1990). A troll is guarding a bridge Dizzy needs to cross. He says the only way to cross is to give him 30 diamonds before kicking Dizzy in the air away from him, but this is a red herring, as there are 30 in the whole game with one behind him and many in the Ice Palace afterwards. The only solution to the puzzle, is to cut the rope holding the goat using the dagger, before hitting him with the stick to make him charge towards the troll. Along his way, the goat butts the troll into the air.
* The tale is also included in the video game &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; (1993).
* In the video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; (2011), near a place called Purewater Run, there is a stone bridge near a waterfall. If it is the player&#x27;s first time there, they will see three goats; upon looking under the bridge, they will find a dead troll.

===Eponymy===
* Oak Mountain State Park near Birmingham, Alabama has a hiking trail and bridge named after the eponymous bridge in the story.

<doc id="1144086" wikidata="Q376035" url="?curid=1144086" title="American Hi-Fi">
<text>American Hi-Fi is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1998. The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Stacy Jones, lead guitarist Jamie Arentzen, bassist and backing vocalist Drew Parsons, and drummer Brian Nolan. Prior to the group&#x27;s formation, Jones was well known for being a drummer in the successful alternative rock bands Veruca Salt and Letters to Cleo. American Hi-Fi has a close relationship with Miley Cyrus, whose band shares two members with American Hi-Fi. The group has a mixed musical style that includes influences from pop-punk, alternative rock, and power pop.

The group released its eponymous debut album in 2001, featuring the hit single &quot;Flavor of the Weak”. The band was awarded as the &quot;Rising Star&quot; from the Boston Music Awards in 2001. &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; followed in 2003 with the singles &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; and &quot;The Breakup Song&quot;. After this, the group was dropped from their label, Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to remake their production and sound. Working with veteran music producer Butch Walker, they released &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot; in 2005. The band then toured to a widespread fan-base in Japan and in the United States. They then released their first studio album in five years, &quot;Fight the Frequency&quot; in August 2010. The band released their fifth album &quot;Blood &amp; Lemonade&quot; on September 9, 2014 worldwide via the independent label Rude Records. Most recently, the band released the &quot;Anywhere Else but Here&quot; EP on August 7, 2020.

==History==
===1998–2003: Formation, &quot;American Hi-Fi&quot; and &quot;The Art of Losing&quot;===
American Hi-Fi initially formed under the name BMX Girl, and Jones changed to a name personally suggested to him by Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones.

American Hi-Fi&#x27;s released self-titled debut album through Island Records on February 27, 2001 which was produced by Bob Rock. It was an AllMusic &#x27;Album Pick&#x27;. Critic Mario Mesquita Borges praised it and stated that &quot;[t]he future of rock &amp; roll is surely guaranteed with acts such as American Hi-Fi.&quot; The album reached No. 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 list and No. 1 on the Heatseekers list. The band also achieved a commercial breakthrough through their debut single, &quot;Flavor of the Weak&quot;, which ran up the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and other charts followed by Another Perfect Day which peaked 33 in Modern Rock Charts.

In February 2003, the band released their second studio album, &quot;The Art of Losing&quot;. The album peaked at number eighty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album featured the successful singles &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; and &quot;The Breakup Song.&quot; The album was produced by producer Nick Launay, who worked with such artists as Talking Heads, Public Image Ltd. and Silverchair. &quot;The Art of Losing&quot; failed to reach the success of the band&#x27;s debut album, leading the band to be dropped by Island Records.

===2004–06: &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot;===
In early 2004 and without a backing label, the band headed to Los Angeles, to begin work on a new album with producer Butch Walker. The album, &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot;, was released in Japan on July 14, 2004. Around this time, Nolan had quit the band to focus on being a father, and was replaced by Jason Sutter.

In November 2004, American Hi-Fi were signed by Maverick Records. Maverick helped promote the lead single from &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot;, &quot;The Geeks Get the Girls&quot;, releasing it as a single for radio airplay and following with a music video in February 2005. After repeated delays, &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot; was released in the United States on April 12, 2005, almost a year after the initial release in Japan. Neither single released with the album broke into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock charts. Maverick dropped the band in the fall of 2005 citing poor record sales.

In the winter of 2005, Playtone Records began seeking submissions for the &quot;Superman Returns&quot; soundtrack. The band submitted a demo, &quot;The Rescue&quot;, which had been recorded for &quot;Hearts on Parade&quot; but was cut from the album. &quot;The Rescue&quot; was selected for the soundtrack and ran in promotions for the film. &quot;The Rescue&quot; also received frequent radio airplay into the spring of 2006, but did not result in a new record contract for the band.

===2007–11: &quot;Fight the Frequency&quot;===
In December 2006, Parsons and Jones met for plans for a follow-up album, the plans were put on hold due to Jones&#x27; busy schedule and Arentzen&#x27;s plans to join Butch Walker&#x27;s touring band in Spring 2007.

In April 2007, American Hi-Fi announced that the band would record their fourth record in May 2007. Soon after, former drummer Brian Nolan re-joined the band.

On January 8, 2008, American Hi-Fi released two new tracks on their Myspace page, both unfinished mixes off their upcoming fourth album. &quot;Keep It Like a Secret&quot; was the first track released followed by &quot;A Taste for Crime&quot;. Frontman Stacy Jones described the new album as sounding &quot;...a little like Elliott Smith partying with the Foo Fighters at a kegger with My Bloody Valentine and Superdrag&quot;. The band also released eight demos, a few of which were recorded live in the studio sans overdubs on their MySpace page including &quot;Fight the Frequency&quot;, &quot;Frat Chump&quot;, &quot;Acetate&quot;, &quot;Bullet&quot;, &quot;This Is a Low&quot;, &quot;Recover the Stars&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Where Love Is a Lie&quot;.

On December 4, 2008, Drew Parsons was interviewed about the band and its upcoming fourth record. Parsons talked about the struggles with their past two labels; Island Records and Maverick Records. He also pointed out that they had signed with Original Sound records and would be releasing a new record in April/May 2009. &quot;The record is complete,&quot; says Parsons, &quot;but now it comes down to selecting the songs that will make it on the record&quot;. However, later in the year, the band had decided not to go through with plans on Original Sound.

The record was released on August 17, 2010.

According to Stacy Jones in a recent interview, the band created their own record label &quot;Hi-Fi Killers/The Ascot Club&quot; (through Megaforce/RED/Sony) as a means of the band owning their music and to have more input and control for the overall direction and promotion of the band&#x27;s releases.

In July 2010 the band released a new music video for the new single &quot;Lost&quot; as well as an EP on iTunes containing four songs, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;This Is a Low&quot;, &quot;Where Love Is a Lie&quot; and &quot;A Taste for Crime&quot;. As well as a new fully developed website. The album &quot;Fight the Frequency&quot; was released on August 17, 2010, but had very little touring to support the effort.

===2012–15: &quot;Blood &amp; Lemonade&quot;===
According to a post on Twitter and Facebook on the band&#x27;s page, the group announced that they would be recording a new album as a follow-up to &quot;Fight the Frequency&quot;. The band had signed with Goomba Music for the release. The album is said to be produced by the band and John Fields and recorded at Stacy Jones&#x27; studio, The Deathstar.

The recording started around February, vocals done on march and the band stated recording was done. It was now for the mixing given to Paul David Hager. Plans were slowed down as Stacy Jones joined Matchbox Twenty for tour as the drummer. On August 1, the band tweeted that their new album will be coming out soon and posted a new track in their website &quot;Killing Time&quot;, followed by a second new track &quot;Wake Up&quot; in September. American Hi-Fi did a one off sold-out show in London on May 7, 2014 and announced their new album will be titled &quot;Blood &amp; Lemonade&quot; and released on September 9, 2014 via independent label Rude Records with a new single released on iTunes &quot;Allison&quot;. On July 15, the band released the second single &quot;Golden State&quot; as an instant grat alongside the album pre-order. On August 19, American Hi-Fi released a music video for their single &quot;Golden State&quot;.

The band joined Summerland Tour 2015 with Everclear, Fuel, and Toadies.

=== 2016: &quot;American Hi-Fi Acoustic&quot; ===
In February 2016, the band announced they were re-recording an acoustic version of their self-titled debut album to be released on Rude Records on April 29, 2016. Stacy Jones said they were initially not interested in the idea, but thought it would be an interesting challenge and recorded it live at Sunset Sounds with minimal overdubs. To go along with the announcement, the band released the music video for &quot;Flavor of the Weak&quot; Acoustic on YouTube.

=== 2020: &quot;Anywhere Else but Here EP&quot; ===
The band released an EP of cover songs on August 7, 2020 titled &quot;Anywhere Else but Here&quot;. On October 10th, 2024, the band released their first new song in a decade: &quot;I&#x27;m Still In Love With Rock and Roll&quot;.

<text>Roope Juhani Latvala (born 25 June 1970) is a Finnish guitarist. He is one of the founding members of the thrash metal band Stone, which was one of the first notable bands in the history of Finnish heavy metal. He was also the former rhythm guitarist for the melodic death metal band Children of Bodom from 2003 to 2015 and the co-lead guitarist for Sinergy.

==Biography==
Latvala was born in Helsinki. At the age of 15, he founded the band Stone together with Janne Joutsenniemi. The band&#x27;s style was initially focused on a more traditional heavy metal, but they soon shifted to a faster and more aggressive sound, which was the key for them to receive mass recognition. In the year of 1991, the band was dissolved, with a discography of four studio albums, one live album and one compilation album. He is the main influence of many Finnish guitarists, especially Alexi Laiho (from Children of Bodom).

After the breakup of Stone, he released an instrumental work with his brother, entitled &quot;Latvala bros&quot;. He then played with Dementia for around a year. In 1995, he joined Waltari after guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö left the band. They played together for six years before Latvala decided to quit the band.

He joined Sinergy after vocalist Kimberly Goss moved from Sweden to Finland and had to reassemble the band, having assumed the role that previously belonged to Jesper Strömblad (from In Flames).

During the whole of his career, Latvala had many side projects and played as a guest musician in many bands, the most notable of the being: Warmen, Nomicon, Pornonorsu, Jailbreakers, Gloomy Grim, Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, and Soulgrind. At times, he also composed movie soundtracks.

When Alexander Kuoppala left Children of Bodom in 2003 in the middle of their world tour, the members of the band were forced to search for a new guitarist in the time span of one month, when their next show would happen. The new guitarist needed to be able to learn about twenty songs to be played live. Alexi Laiho allegedly tried to recruit Kai R. Nergård of the Norwegian band Griffin, who declined. With little time left, Latvala contacted Laiho and asked him if Children of Bodom needed any help on the tour. Laiho agreed that he would be a session player because he was the only guitarist he deemed skilled enough to manage the feat of learning the songs with enough accuracy to replace Kuoppala, who had been playing with the band for 10 years.

Latvala played the Moscow concert on 16 August successfully. Despite the initial announcement that he would be a session player only, he remained with the band and recorded the &quot;Trashed, Lost &amp; Strungout&quot; EP. He continued playing with the band and also recorded the hit LP &quot;Are You Dead Yet?&quot;. Latvala played two guitar solos on &quot;Are You Dead Yet?&quot;, despite the widely accepted notion that Laiho plays all solos on Bodom albums.

When he joined Children of Bodom, Latvala made a deal with ESP Guitars, which already endorsed Laiho and Henkka Seppälä. Before that, he used Jackson Guitars almost exclusively (Latvala could be seen wearing the infamous Jackson T-shirt that reads &quot;Get the Best, Fuck the Rest&quot;), and it is not unusual for him to use his old Jacksons live.

There were rumors which said that he would switch sides with Jesper Strömblad of In Flames, but he denied it saying that he had never heard anything about it, and added &quot;I said that I like Dark Tranquillity and In Flames. But somebody misunderstood me and wrote silly things in a metal magazine. So we are together with my lovely friend Alexi Laiho and the whole crew.&quot;

As of late May 2015, Latvala no longer is a member of Children of Bodom with the band having recorded the &quot;I Worship Chaos&quot; album as a four-piece, he was later replaced by guitarist Daniel Freyberg of Naildown and Norther. According to Latvala, he was fired from Children of Bodom just days before recording for the album was about to start. He later stated that he felt like he was &quot;stabbed in the back&quot; by his former bandmates, while the band themselves said Latvala was not committed to the group, which included missing practices.

==Guitars==
On the Latvala Bros. Myspace page, it states that Latvala uses &quot;metal plectrums&quot;. Latvala plays his ESP custom Random Star on stage and in the studio, yet he still, on some occasions, uses his old Jackson RR&#x27;s. These guitars have become highly famous among Finnish guitar players, and Latvala was instrumental in cementing Jackson Guitars as the best selling guitar brand in Finland.

ESP guitars released in early 2008 an LTD Roope Latvala signature guitar. It features an alder, Star shaped body, a neck-through maple neck with an ebony fretboard, cross inlays and reversed headstock. It includes an Original Floyd Rose bridge, Grover Tuners, a single EMG HZ H-2 bridge pickup with a single volume control. His signature guitar is discontinued in North America as of 2011. ESP produces an ESP comprised Roope Latvala signature series in Japan.

<text>Johann Wolfgang Ritter von Kempelen de Pázmánd (; 23 January 1734 – 26 March 1804) was a Hungarian author, engineer, and inventor, known for his chess-playing &quot;automaton&quot; hoax The Turk and for his speaking machine.

== Personal life ==
Von Kempelen was born in Pressburg (today&#x27;s Bratislava, Slovakia), then capital city of the Kingdom of Hungary within the Habsburg Empire, the last child of Engelbert Kempelen (1680–1761), and Anna Theresa Spindler. Contrary to some reports, he did not hold the title of &quot;Ritter&quot; or &quot;Baron.&quot; This misconception may stem from historical confusion with one of his older brothers, Johannes Nepomuk Joseph, who attained the rank of general within the Habsburg Empire, and who was granted the title &quot;Kempelen von Pázmánd&quot; after purchasing a former Jesuit estate in Pázmánd, a village south of Budapest.

Von Kempelen studied law and philosophy in Pressburg, and attended the Academy in Győr, Vienna and Rome, but mathematics and physics also interested him. Besides Pressburg&#x27;s native tongues of German, Hungarian and Slavic, von Kempelen also spoke Latin, French, Italian, and later, some English and Romanian, which he learned during his travels in England and assignments in The Banat. He applied for his first position with the Habsburg Court in 1755 as a supernumary clerk in the Hungarian Court Chamber in Pozsony. Later he became a secretary (1757), a Councillor of the Court Chamber (1764), Director of Salt Mining (1765), Second Commissioner of the Constitutional Commission for the Region of Banat (1769), and finally Imperial-Royal Court Councillor (1787). During this time he also helped transfer the University of Nagyszombat to Buda Castle, and oversaw the building of the Court Theatre in Buda&#x27;s former Carmelite monastery.

He married twice, first in 1757 to Maria Franziska Piani, who died suddenly in 1758 of an abdominal obstruction, and again in 1762 to Maria Anna von Gobelius, who had served as a lady&#x27;s companion in the house of Count Johannes Erdődy, the vice-president of the Hungarian Court Chancery. Five children were born from his second marriage, of whom two survived into adulthood: Maria Theresia (1768–1812) and Karl (1771–1822).

== Inventions ==
Though he had a long and successful career as a civil servant, von Kempelen was most famous for his construction of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton presented to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, dressed in Turkish robes and a turban, seated behind a large cabinet on top of which a chessboard was placed. The machine appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, but was in fact merely an elaborate simulation of mechanical automation: a human chess master concealed inside the cabinet puppeteered the Turk from below by means of a series of levers. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin.

Kempelen also created a manually operated speaking machine. An early version (possibly an original) can still be seen in the Musical Instruments section of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1789, he published a book containing his nearly twenty years of speech research, &quot;Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache Nebst Beschreibung seiner sprechenden Maschine&quot;.

He constructed steam engines, water pumps, a pontoon bridge in Pressburg (1770), patented a steam turbine for mills (1788/89) and a typewriter for Mozart&#x27;s friend a blind Viennese pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (1779), and built a theatre house in Buda (inaugurated 25 October 1790) (now Budapest) and the famous fountains at Schönbrunn in Vienna (1780). He was also a talented artist and etcher, wrote poems and epigrams, and composed a &quot;singspiel&quot;, &quot;Andromeda and Perseus&quot;, performed in Vienna.

== Retirement and death ==

He retired in 1798, after forty-three years of service to the Austrian Empire. Some sources claim he was destitute at the time of his retirement because the Emperor revoked his pension, though this conclusion is most likely a misunderstanding of his multiple pensions. In 1771, Maria Theresia honored von Kempelen with an annual pension of 1,000 ducats for his exemplary work, but after her death, her son Joseph II made drastic cuts to the benefits granted to the court&#x27;s civil servants, and von Kempelen&#x27;s supplementary pension was revoked in 1781. Upon his retirement, von Kempelen was granted a pension equal to his final salary of 5,000 Gulden, and in 1802, he sought to recover the income from his smaller annual pension by submitting a petition to Francis II, requesting compensation in the amount of 20,000 Gulden accrued in expenses in service to the crown, but was ultimately denied.

At the time of his death in 1804, he owned a country estate in Gomba near Pressburg, but died in his apartment on the Alsergrund, a suburb of Vienna.

The Wolfgang von Kempelen Computing Science History Prize was named in his honor, as was a high school in Budapest.

<text>Legality, in respect of an act, agreement, or contract is the state of being consistent with the law or of being lawful or unlawful in a given jurisdiction, and the construct of power. &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; defines legality as &quot;1: attachment to or observance of law. 2: the quality or state of being legal.&quot; BusinessDictionary.com, &quot;The Law Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;My Law Dictionary&quot; definition explains concept of attachment to law as &quot;Implied warranty that an act, agreement, or contract strictly adheres to the statutes of a particular jurisdiction. For example, in insurance contracts it is assumed that all risks covered under the policy are legal ventures.&quot;

== Definitions ==
Vicki Schultz states that we collectively have a shared knowledge about most concepts. How we interpret the reality of our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about the same set of facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue – meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend &quot;on new information and experiences&quot;; this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley definition of legality – our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law.

Ewik and Silbey define &quot;legality&quot; more broadly as &quot;those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are in some sense legal although not necessarily approved or acknowledged by official law. The concept of legality the opportunity to consider how where and with what effect law is produced in and through commonplace social interactions. ... How do our roles and statuses our relationships, our obligations, prerogatives and responsibilities, our identities and our behavoiurs bear the imprint of law.&quot;

In a paper on &quot;Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality&quot;, legality is defined taking the state&#x27;s role in to account as &quot;The system of laws and regulations of right and wrong behavior that are enforceable by the state (federal, state, or local governmental body in the U.S.) through the exercise of its policing powers and judicial process, with the threat and use of penalties, including its monopoly on the right to use physical violence.&quot;

== Other related concepts ==
Rule of law provides for availability of rules, laws and legal mechanism to implement them. Principle of legality checks for availability and quality of the laws. Legality checks for if certain behaviour is according to law or not. concept of Legitimacy of law looks for fairness or acceptability of fairness of process of implementation of law.

The quality of being legal and observance to the law may pertain to lawfulness, i.e. being consistent to the law or it may get discussed in principle of legality or may be discussed as legal legitimacy.

===Legality of purpose===
In contract law, legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose.

=== Constitutional legality ===
The principle of legality can be affected in different ways by different constitutional models. In the United States, laws may not violate the stated provisions of the United States Constitution which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws. In the United Kingdom under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, the legislature can (in theory) pass such retrospective laws as it sees fit, though article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has legal force in Britain, forbids conviction for a crime which was not illegal at the time it was committed. Article 7 has already had an effect in a number of cases in the British courts.

In contrast many written constitutions prohibit the creation of retroactive (normally criminal) laws. However the possibility of statutes being struck down creates its own problems. It is clearly more difficult to ascertain what is a valid statute when any number of statutes may have constitutional question marks hanging over them. When a statute is declared unconstitutional, the actions of public authorities and private individuals which were legal under the invalidated statute, are retrospectively tainted with illegality. Such a result could not occur under parliamentary sovereignty (or at least not before &quot;Factortame&quot;) as a statute was law and its validity could not be questioned in any court.

=== Principle of legality ===
The principle that no one be convicted of a crime without a written legal text which clearly describes the crime is widely accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the rule of law. It is known in Latin as .

==International law==

Legality, in its criminal aspect, is a principle of international human rights law, and is incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. However the imposition of penalties for offences illegal under international law or criminal according to &quot;the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations&quot; are normally excluded from its ambit. As such the trial and punishment for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity does not breach international law.

There is some debate about whether this is really a true exception or not. Some people would argue that it is a derogation or – perhaps somewhat more harshly – an infringement of the principle of legality. While others would argue that crimes such as genocide are contrary to natural law and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the Nuremberg trials and the trial of Adolf Eichmann, both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions.

The territorial principle, generally confining national jurisdiction to a nation’s borders, has been expanded to accommodate extraterritorial, national interest.

In criminal law, the principle of legality assures the primacy of law in all criminal proceedings.

<text>Maksim Mrvica (; born 3 May 1975) is a Croatian pianist. He plays classical crossover music.

== Biography ==
Mrvica was born in Šibenik, Croatia. He took piano lessons at the age of nine. Three years later he gave his first concert performance of Haydn&#x27;s Piano Concerto in C major. When the Croatian war of independence started in 1991, both Mrvica and his professor were determined that this would not disrupt his music studies. In spite of the war and surrounding turbulence, Mrvica entered in, and won, his first major competition in Zagreb in 1993.

Mrvica went on to study at the Music Academy in Zagreb where he spent five years under Professor Vladimir Krpan, who himself was a pupil of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. He then spent a year at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest and during this year he won first prize at the Nikolai Rubinstein International Piano Competition. In 2000, he moved to Paris to study with Igor Lazko and gained first prize in the Pontoise Piano Competition in 2001.

== International appeal ==
Mrvica was spotted by Tonči Huljić, who composed several tracks for the crossover string quartet, Bond, and introduced Mrvica to British impresario Mel Bush. EMI Classics was also interested in Mrvica and soon a new album was underway. This album was &quot;The Piano Player&quot;, which gave a new spin to compositions by Handel and Chopin. Since its release in 2003 it has been successful, in Asia, where it has achieved Gold status in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and mainland China, Platinum in Taiwan and Croatia and Double Platinum in Hong Kong. It was also in the number 1 slot in the HMV international pop chart in Hong Kong for twelve consecutive weeks.

Under Mel Bush&#x27;s management, Mrvica&#x27;s performances generally take place against a backdrop of special lighting, stage and video effects.

Mrvica&#x27;s piece &quot;Exodus&quot; was used as the floor music of Russian artistic gymnast Anna Pavlova in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

== Adaptations and arrangements ==
There is a Chinese lyrical version added to the non-lyrical song of Maksim Mrvica&#x27;s &quot;Claudine&quot;. This musical piece was sung and written by singer Edmond Leung from Hong Kong. According to Boxup.com, Edmond was so captivated by Maksim&#x27;s performance of &quot;Claudine&quot; that he asked Maksim&#x27;s permission to do a lyrical version in Cantonese. Soon after in 2004, their collaboration produced the bittersweet ballad called &quot;信望愛&quot; (sun3 mong6 ngoi3) (&quot;Trust Hope Love&quot;).

<doc id="1144146" wikidata="Q584435" url="?curid=1144146" title="Patani Kingdom">
<text>Patani, or the Sultanate of Patani (Jawi: كسلطانن ڤطاني) was a Malay sultanate in the historical Pattani Region. It covered approximately the area of the modern Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and part of the Malaysian state of Kelantan. The 2nd–15th century state of Langkasuka and the 6th–7th century state of Pan Pan may have been related.

The golden age of Patani started during the reign of the first of its four successive queens, Raja Hijau (The Green Queen), who came to the throne in 1584 and was followed by Raja Biru (The Blue Queen), Raja Ungu (The Purple Queen) and Raja Kuning (The Yellow Queen). During this period the kingdom&#x27;s economic and military strength was greatly increased to the point that it was able to fight off four major Siamese invasions. It had declined by the late 17th century and it was invaded by Siam in 1786, which eventually absorbed the state after its last raja was deposed in 1902.

==Predecessors==

An early kingdom in the Patani area was the Hindu-Buddhist Langkasuka, founded in the region as early as the 2nd century. It appeared in many accounts by Chinese travellers, among them was the Buddhist pilgrim Yijing. The kingdom drew trade from Chinese, Indian, and local traders as a stopping place for ships bound for, or arriving from, the Gulf of Thailand. Langkasuka reached its greatest economic success in the 6th and 7th centuries and afterward declined as a major trade center. Political circumstances suggest that by the 11th century, Langkasuka was no longer a major port visited by merchants. However, much of the decline may be due to the silting up of the waterway linking it to the sea.

The most substantial ruins believed to be ancient Langkasuka have been found in Yarang located approximately 15 kilometres from the sea and the current city of Pattani. How or when Langkasuka was replaced by Patani is unknown. Patani is not mentioned in the Javanese text &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; written in 1365, but places such as Langkasuka, Sai and Kelantan are, which may indicate Patani had yet to be founded in this period. &quot;Hikayat Patani&quot; indicates that the immediate predecessor of Patani was Kota Mahligai (&quot;the citadel town&quot;) whose ruler founded Patani, perhaps some time between 1350 and 1450. This Patani was located in Keresik (name in Malay) or Kru Se (in Thai), a few kilometers to the east of the current city.

However, some think Patani was the same country known to the Chinese as Pan Pan.

The region had been subject to Siamese control for some time. In the 14th century, King Ram Khamhaeng the Great ( – 1317) of Sukhothai occupied Nakhon Si Thammarat and its vassal states which would include Patani if it had existed at that date. The Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom also conquered the isthmus during the 14th century, and controlled many smaller vassal states in a self-governing system in which the vassal states and tributary provinces pledged allegiance to the king of Ayutthaya, but otherwise ran their own affairs.

==Founding legends==
The &quot;Hikayat Patani&quot; suggests the name Patani means &quot;this beach&quot; which is &quot;pata ni&quot; (&quot;pantai ini&quot;) in the local Malay language. In this story, a ruler went hunting one day and saw a beautiful white mouse-deer the size of a goat, which then disappeared. He asked his men where the animal had gone, and they replied: &quot;Pata ni lah!&quot; This ruler then ordered a town be built where the mouse-deer had disappeared it was then named after &quot;this beach&quot;. The founder is named in some sources as either Sri Wangsa or Phaya Tunakpa, a ruler of Kota Malikha or Kota Mahligai. The first ruler of Patani (some sources say his son) later converted to Islam and took the name Sultan Ismail Shah or Mahmud Shah.The &quot;Hikayat Patani&quot; also mentions that the ruler met an old fisherman there, who replied &quot;Encik Tani&quot; (&quot;Mister Tani&quot;) when asked his name. An alternative suggestion is therefore that the town was named after the old fisherman, Pak Tani (Father Tani), who was sent by a king from the interior to survey the coast, to find a place for an appropriate settlement. After he established a successful fishing outpost, other people moved to join him. The town that grew into a prosperous trading center would continue to bear his name.

==Early history==

Patani has been suggested to be founded some time between 1350 and 1450, although its history before 1500 is unclear. According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, Chau Sri Wangsa, a Siamese prince, founded Patani by conquering &quot;Kota Mahligai&quot;. He converted to Islam and took on the title of &quot;Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah&quot; in the late 15th to early 16th century. Patani may have become Islamised some time in the middle of 15th century, one source gives a date of 1470, but earlier dates have been proposed.

A story tells of a sheikh named Sa&#x27;id or Shafi&#x27;uddin from Kampong Pasai (presumably a small community of traders from Pasai who lived on the outskirts of Patani) reportedly healed the king of a rare skin disease. After much negotiation (and recurrence of the disease), the king agreed to convert to Islam, adopting the name Sultan Ismail Shah. All of the Sultan&#x27;s officials also agreed to convert. However, there is fragmentary evidence that some local people had begun to convert to Islam prior to this. The existence of a diasporic Pasai community near Patani shows the locals had regular contact with Muslims.

Patani became more important after Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511 as Muslim traders sought alternative trading ports. A Dutch source indicates that most of the traders were Chinese, but 300 Portuguese traders had also settled in Patani by 1540s, but there were also Siamese and Japanese merchants. Portuguese sources mentioned their attack on Patani in 1524 and Chinese living in the city. Raja Mahmud ruled in the mid-16th century and was seen as &#x27;ruling justly&#x27; which caused considerable developments to the region.

Sultan Ismail Shah was succeeded by Mudhaffar Shah. This period saw the rise of Burma, which made war on Ayutthaya. Another Burmese-Siamese war (1563–1564) led by King Bayinnaung forced King Maha Chakkraphat to surrender in 1564. Taking advantage of the instability in Ayutthaya, the sultan of Patani Mudhaffar Shah attacked Ayutthaya in 1563 due to his unwelcome reception in the Thai court in the years prior. King Chakkraphat fled the city for two months but Mudhaffar failed to take the throne. He died suddenly in 1564 on his way back to Patani. His brother Sultan Manzur Shah (1564–1572) who was left in charge in Patani while he was away then became the ruler of Patani.

Manzur Shah ruled for nine years, and after his death, Patani entered a period of political instability and violence. Two of its rulers were murdered by their relatives in fights for succession. The nine-year-old Raja Patik Siam (son of Mudhaffar Shah) and his regent (his aunt Raja Aisyah), were both murdered by his brother Raja Mambang, who was in turn killed. The son of Manzur Shah, Raja Bahdur, succeeded at the age of 10, but was later murdered by his half-brother Raja Bima after a dispute, and Raja Bima was himself killed.

==Four queens of Patani==
===Raja Hijau and the golden age of Patani===

Raja Hijau (or Ratu Hijau, the Green Queen) came to the throne in 1584, apparently the result of a lack of male heirs after they were all killed in the turbulent preceding period, and became the first queen of Patani. Raja Hijau acknowledged Siamese authority, and adopted the title of &quot;peracau&quot; derived from the Siamese royal title &quot;phra chao&quot;. Early in her reign she saw off an attempted coup by her prime minister, Bendahara Kayu Kelat. She also ordered that a channel be dug with a river dammed to divert water to ensure the supply of water to Patani.

Raja Hijau ruled for 32 years, and brought considerable stability to the country. During her reign, trade with the outside increased, and as a result Pattani prospered. It also become a centre of culture, producing high quality works of music, dance, drama and handicraft. An Englishman Peter Floris who visited Patani in 1612–1613 described a dance performed in Patani as the finest he had seen in the Indies.

==== Growth as an entrepôt ====

Chinese merchants were important in the rise of Patani as a regional trade center. Chinese, Malay and Siamese merchants traded throughout the area, as well as Persians, Indians and Arabs. They were joined by others including the Portuguese in 1516, the Japanese in 1592, the Dutch in 1602, the English in 1612. The period of prosperity lasted between 1584 to 1688. Many Chinese also moved to Patani, perhaps due to the activity of Chinese pirate Lin Daoqian. A 1603 Dutch report by Jacob van Neck estimated that there may be as many Chinese in Patani as there were native Malays, and that they were responsible for most of the commercial activity of Patani. In 1619, John Jourdain, the East India Company&#x27;s chief factor at Bantam was killed off the coast of Patani by the Dutch. Ships were also lost, which eventually led to the withdrawal of the English from Patani.

Potteries from the middle Ming to late Qing dynasties are found in the city, indicating extensive faraway trade. Patani was seen by European traders as a way to access the Chinese market. After 1620, the Dutch and English both closed their warehouses, but a prosperous trade was continued by the Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese for most of the 17th century.

Raja Hijau died on 28 August 1616 and was succeeded by her sister Raja Biru (the Blue Queen), who was around 50 when she became queen. Raja Biru persuaded the Kelantan Sultanate that lay to the south to become incorporated into Patani.

After Raja Biru died in 1624, she was succeeded by her younger sister Raja Ungu (the Purple Queen). Raja Ungu, was more confrontational towards the Siamese, and abandoned the Siamese title &quot;peracau&quot;, using instead &quot;paduka syah alam&quot; (&quot;her excellency ruler of the world&quot;). She stopped paying the &quot;bunga mas&quot; tribute to Siam, and formed an alliance with Johor, marrying her daughter (who later became Raja Kuning) off to their ruler Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III. However, her daughter was already married to the king of Bordelong (Phatthalung), Okphaya Déca, who prompted the Siamese to attack Patani in 1633–1634. Siam, however, failed to take Patani.

===Yellow Queen and decline===
Raja Ungu died in 1634, and was succeeded by the last of four successive female rulers of Patani, Raja Kuning (or Ratu Kuning, the Yellow Queen). The war with Siam had caused considerable suffering to Patani as well as a significant decline in trade, and Raja Kuning adopted a more conciliatory stance towards the Siamese. The Siamese had intended to attack Patani again in 1635, but the Raja of Kedah intervened to help with the negotiation. In 1641, Raja Kuning visited the Ayutthayan court to resume good relation. The power of the queen had declined by this period, and she did not appear to wield any significant political power. In 1646, Patani joined other tributary states to rebel against Ayutthaya, but was later subdued by Ayutthaya.

== Kelantanese rajas==

According to Kelantanese sources, Raja Kuning was deposed in 1651 by the Raja of Kelantan, who installed his son as the ruler of Patani, and the period of Kelantanese dynasty in Patani began. A different queen appeared to have been in control of Patani again by 1670, and three queens of Kelantan lineage may have ruled Patani from 1670 to 1718.

When Phetracha took control of Ayutthaya in 1688, Patani refused to acknowledge his authority and rebelled. Ayutthaya then invaded with 50,000 men and subdued Patani. Following the invasion, political disorder continued for five decades, during which the local rulers were helpless to end the lawlessness of the region, and most foreign merchants abandoned trade with Patani. Towards the end of the 17th century, Patani was described in Chinese sources as sparsely populated and barbaric.

==Reassertion of Siamese power==
In the 18th century, Ayutthaya under King Ekkathat faced another Burmese invasion. This culminated in the capture and destruction of the city of Ayutthaya in 1767, as well as the death of the king. Siam was shattered, and as rivals fought for the vacant throne, Patani declared its complete independence.

King Taksin defeated the Burmese and reunified the country, opening the way for the establishment of the Chakri dynasty by his successor, King Rama I. In 1786 Siam sent an army led by Prince Surasi (Viceroy Boworn Maha Surasinghanat), younger brother of King Rama I, to seek the submission of Patani.

===Patani in the Bangkok Period===
The siege of Patani by Siam occurred in 1786, this is followed by the destruction of the town, massacres as well as deportations of the inhabitants. Further, Siam invaded Patani several times in 1789–1791, 1808, 1831–1832 and 1838. This served to completely end the centuries old mandala system, effectively ending Pattani&#x27;s status of an independent state. Bangkok divided Patani into seven small principalities (&quot;hua muang&quot;). Britain recognised the Siamese ownership of Patani in the Burney Treaty in 1826. The throne stayed vacant for a few decades until 1842, when a member of Kelantanese royalty returned to reclaim the throne. While the raja ruled over Patani independently of Siam, Patani also recognised the authority of Siam and regularly sent the bunga mas tribute. 

In 1902, in a bid to assert full control of Patani, Siam arrested and deposed the last raja of Patani after he refused Siam&#x27;s demand for administrative reform, thus ending Patani as an independent state.

== Chronology of rulers ==

<text>Fisher College is a private college in Boston, Massachusetts. It is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

==History==
Fisher College first opened its doors in 1903, founded by Myron C. Fisher and Edmund H. Fisher under the name Winter Hill Business College in the predominantly working-class city of Somerville, Massachusetts, just two miles north of Boston. The school traces its roots to educational entrepreneurs Myron and Edmund Fisher, who believed the immigrants of that city in the early 1900s should have an opportunity to advance beyond unskilled labor jobs. Fisher College moved to its current Beacon Street location in 1939. The Beacon Street site is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail. During the 1940s, the college was split into two separate entities: The Fisher School for Men and The Fisher School for Women. 

In 1952, the Board of Regents of Higher Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved Fisher as a two-year college, and five years later it was given degree-granting powers. In 1970, Fisher gained accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and operates as an independent, non-profit educational institution.

The Division of Graduate and Professional Studies was established in 1975 to serve the adult population of Eastern Massachusetts. Fisher College began offering online courses and degrees in 1998. In 1999, the College&#x27;s first bachelor&#x27;s degree – the Bachelor of Science in Management – was offered, and in 2015 the College&#x27;s first master&#x27;s – a Master of Business Administration with a focus on strategic leadership – was accredited.

===Presidents===
==Academics==
Fisher College offers graduate programs, including a Master of Business Administration (MBA) with a concentration in Strategic Leadership, bachelor&#x27;s and associate degrees, and certifications.

==Student demographics==

As of Fall 2022, student population at Fisher College was 1,421, including Graduate and Professional Studies enrollments. Fifty percent of Fisher College students on-campus in Boston were from Massachusetts, 8% from the remaining New England area, 17% international, and 25% from other states in the U.S. 52% of students were male and 48% female.

==Athletics==
The Fisher athletic teams are called the Falcons. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Continental Athletic Conference since the 2012–13 academic year. The Falcons previously competed in the American Mideast Conference during the 2011–12 school year and in the Sunrise Conference from 2002–03 to 2010–11.

Fisher competes in 8 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, soccer and volleyball while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball.

<text>Patrick Vincent Coleman (13 March 18726 December 1917) was a train dispatcher for the Canadian Government Railways (formerly the ICR, Intercolonial Railway of Canada) who was killed in the Halifax Explosion, but not before he sent a message to an incoming passenger train to stop outside the range of the explosion. He is remembered as one of the heroic figures from the disaster.

==Event==
On the morning of 6 December 1917, the 45-year-old Coleman and Chief Clerk William Lovett were working in the Richmond station, surrounded by the railway yards near the foot of Richmond Street, only a few hundred feet from Pier 6. From there, trains were controlled on the mainline into Halifax. The line ran along the western shore of Bedford Basin from Rockingham Station to the city&#x27;s passenger terminal at the North Street Station, located a mile to the south of Richmond Station. Coleman was an experienced dispatcher who had been commended a few years earlier for helping to safely stop a runaway train.

At approximately 8:45 a.m., there was a collision between , a French munitions ship carrying a cargo of high explosives, and a Norwegian vessel, . Immediately thereafter &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; caught fire, and the crew abandoned the ship. The vessel drifted from near the mid-channel over to Pier 6 on the slack tide in a matter of minutes and beached herself. A sailor, believed to have been sent ashore by a naval officer, warned Coleman and Lovett of her cargo of high explosives. The overnight express train No. 10 from Saint John, New Brunswick, carrying nearly 300 passengers, was due to arrive at 8:55 a.m. Before leaving the office, Lovett called CGR terminal agent Henry Dustan to warn him of a burning ship laden with explosives that was heading for the pier. After sending Lovett&#x27;s message, Coleman and Lovett were said to have left the CGR depot. However, Coleman returned to the telegraph office and continued sending warning messages along the rail line as far as Truro to stop trains inbound for Halifax. An accepted version of Coleman&#x27;s Morse code message reads as follows:

Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye, boys.

The telegraphed warnings were apparently heeded, as the No. 10 passenger train was stopped just before the explosion occurred. The train was halted at Rockingham Station, on the western shore of Bedford Basin, approximately from the downtown terminal. After the explosion, Coleman&#x27;s message, followed by other messages later sent by railway officials who made their way to Rockingham, passed word of the disaster to the rest of Canada. The railway quickly mobilized aid, sending a dozen relief trains with fire and medical help from towns in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the disaster, followed two days later by help from other parts of Canada and from the United States, most notably Boston. Even though Lovett had left the station, both he and Coleman were killed in the explosion.

Although historians debate whether Coleman&#x27;s initial message actually contributed to stopping the No. 10 train, there is some documented evidence to indicate it did. No. 10&#x27;s Conductor Gillespie reported to the &quot;Moncton Transcript&quot; that although running on time, &quot;his train was held for fifteen minutes by the dispatcher at Rockingham.&quot;

==Legacy==
Vince Coleman was also the subject of a Heritage Minute and was a prominent character in the CBC miniseries &quot;Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion&quot;. The Heritage Minute and other sources contain historical inaccuracies in that Coleman is shown warning others in the area surrounding the depot station of the impending explosion. In reality the Richmond Station was surrounded by freight yards. Another error is the exaggeration of the number of passengers aboard the Saint John train. The four-car overnight passenger train contained a maximum of 300 people, not 700 as stated in the Heritage Minute. The warning message is also changed. 

Coleman&#x27;s telegraph key, watch and pen are on display in the Halifax Explosion exhibit at Halifax&#x27;s Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.

Coleman is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Halifax, at the intersection of Mumford Road with Joseph Howe Drive. A street is named after him in the Clayton Park neighbourhood of Halifax, and in 2007 a section of Albert Street near his old home was renamed Vincent Street. A condominium near Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bayer&#x27;s Road is named The Vincent Coleman, also in his honour.

Coleman was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004. A Halifax harbour ferry was named &quot;Vincent Coleman&quot;, by popular vote in the spring of 2017. The ferry was dedicated and officially entered service in a ceremony at the Halifax ferry terminal on 14 March 2018.

==Personal life==
Coleman was survived by his wife Frances (1877–1970), although she and the youngest of their four children were seriously injured in the explosion.

<text>Northolt is a station on the London Underground Central line in Northolt in the London Borough of Ealing. It is in Travelcard Zone 5 and between Greenford and South Ruislip stations.

==History==
The Great Western Railway constructed a halt just to the east of this location named Northolt Halt in 1907, on their &quot;New North Main Line&quot; (now the Acton–Northolt line) to Birmingham. It was renamed Northolt (for West End) Halt, before gaining station status under its original shorter name. It was closed in 1948 when the Central line was extended on a new pair of tracks from North Acton, the current Northolt tube station opening on the opposite side of the road bridge on 21 November 1948. The opening had been planned to be in the 1930s but was delayed by World War II.

==The station today==
The station has an island platform with passenger access down from the booking hall. Trains terminating at the station may use either a turnback siding west of the platforms to leave the running lines and run eastwards later or a crossover east of the station for more immediate return to central London.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step-free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

North of the Central line tracks there is the singled track of the Acton–Northolt line from Paddington which is now used by freight trains and a single daily passenger &quot;parliamentary service&quot; (operated by Chiltern Railways) between Paddington and Gerrards Cross. There are no longer any platforms on this line.

<text>Sideways is a 2004 American comedy-drama road film directed by Alexander Payne and written by Jim Taylor and Payne. A film adaptation of Rex Pickett&#x27;s 2004 novel, &quot;Sideways&quot; follows two men in their forties, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti), a depressed teacher and unsuccessful writer, and Jack Cole (Thomas Haden Church), a past-his-prime actor, who take a week-long road trip to Santa Barbara County wine country to celebrate Jack&#x27;s upcoming wedding. Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen also star as women they encounter during their trip.

&quot;Sideways&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2004, and was released in the United States on October 22, 2004. It received widespread acclaim from critics and is regarded as one of the greatest films of the 2000s. At the 77th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Haden Church), Best Supporting Actress (Madsen), and Best Adapted Screenplay, the last of which it won.

==Plot==
Miles Raymond picks up his friend Jack Cole at the home of Cole’s fiance to begin a week together in advance of Cole’s wedding. Miles, a school teacher and unpublished author, starts the trip at his mother’s house, ostensibly to wish her a happy birthday, but Miles steals money before they leave.

Miles wants to spend the week relaxing, playing golf, and enjoying good food and wine. However, Jack is interested in trying to cure Miles’ depression over his professional failures and divorce by finding him a sex partner.  Jack is ambivalent over his pending marriage and the prospect of giving up his acting ambitions in favor of a job with his fiance&#x27;s father. In the Santa Ynez valley, Miles, an oenophile, teaches Jack how to taste wine. The pair dine at The Hitching Post II. Jack infers that Maya, a waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted, is interested in Miles. Jack tells Maya that Miles&#x27; manuscript has been accepted for publication, although it is only being considered. 

The next morning Jack announces his intention to find sex partners during the trip. That night, he arranges a double date for himself and Miles with a wine pourer named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya.

During the date, Miles gets drunk and telephones Victoria, his ex-wife, after learning from Jack that she has remarried and will be bringing her new husband to Jack&#x27;s wedding. The couples go to Stephanie&#x27;s house, where Stephanie and Jack adjourn to Stephanie&#x27;s bedroom leaving Miles and Maya alone. The two connect through their mutual interest in wine, and Miles kisses her awkwardly. As they part, Miles gives Maya a copy of his manuscript, which she had earlier expressed interest in reading.

Jack claims to have fallen in love with Stephanie and tells Miles he wants to postpone the wedding and move to the Santa Ynez Valley to be closer to her. After spending time with Jack and Stephanie at wineries and a picnic, Miles and Maya return to Maya&#x27;s apartment and have sex. The next day, Miles reveals to Maya that Jack is getting married. Disgusted with the men&#x27;s dishonesty, Maya dumps Miles.

Jack and Miles go to a winery that Miles finds subpar. After hearing from his literary agent that his manuscript has been rejected, an upset Miles pesters the pourer for a full glass of wine. When the server refuses, Miles drinks from the spit bucket, creating a scene. Jack intervenes and drives Miles back to the motel. Upon arrival, Stephanie, who heard from Maya about Jack&#x27;s marital status, furiously beats Jack with her motorcycle helmet, breaking his nose, while berating him for his dishonesty. Miles takes Jack to the ER and leaves Maya an apologetic voice message, admitting that his book will not be published.

That night, despite Miles&#x27; protests, Jack goes home with a waitress named Cammi. Jack returns to the motel naked after Cammi&#x27;s husband had caught the two having sex. Jack begs Miles to help him retrieve his wallet, which contains custom wedding rings. Miles sneaks into the house, where he finds Cammi and her husband having sex. He grabs the wallet and runs, barely escaping Cammi&#x27;s nude and furious husband. On the drive back to San Diego, Jack intentionally drives Miles&#x27;s car into a tree to support his alibi that he broke his nose in a car accident. The pair return to Christine&#x27;s home, where Jack is warmly received by her family.

Following the wedding ceremony, Miles runs into Victoria and meets her new husband, Ken. Victoria says she is pregnant. Miles absconds before the reception and drives back to his San Diego apartment. Alone, he drinks his prized wine, a 1961 Château Cheval Blanc, from a disposable styrofoam soda cup at a fast-food restaurant. One day, after coming home from his teaching job, Miles receives a voicemail from Maya, saying she loved his manuscript, encouraging him to keep writing, and inviting him to visit. Miles drives back to wine country and knocks on Maya&#x27;s door.

==Impact on wine industry==

Wineries and locations in the Santa Ynez Valley are prominently featured in the film, drawing attention and increased tourism to the Sta. Rita Hills AVA wine region in Santa Barbara County and California&#x27;s Central Coast. During the film, Miles speaks fondly of the red wine varietal Pinot noir while denigrating Merlot. After the film&#x27;s U.S. release in October 2004, Merlot sales dropped 2% while Pinot noir sales increased 16% in the Western United States. A similar trend occurred in British wine outlets.

A 2009 study by Sonoma State University found that &quot;Sideways&quot; slowed the growth in Merlot sales volume and caused its price to fall, but the film&#x27;s main effect on the U.S. wine industry was a rise in the sales volume and price of Pinot noir and in overall wine consumption.

A 2022 study in the &quot;Journal of Wine Economics&quot; found that &quot;Sideways&quot; caused a reduction in demand for Merlot and an increase in demand for Pinot noir in the United States, which led California winemakers to grow Pinot noir grapes in unsuitable land and blend those grapes with the grapes grown in high-quality areas just to meet demand, which may have led to worse Pinot noir wines.

Sideways Fest is an annual 3-day event hosted by the Sta. Rita Hills Wine Alliance celebrating the movie&#x27;s release featuring the local viticulture and scenery.

===&quot;Sideways&quot; Pinot noir===
In 2013, Rex Pickett, author of the &quot;Sideways&quot; novel, released his own Pinot noir named Le Plus Ultra. In 2020, he released a Pinot noir named Sideways.

==Soundtrack==

The original soundtrack album features 15 jazz instrumentals composed and produced by Rolfe Kent and was orchestrated and arranged for the band by Tony Blondal. The album was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Original Score&quot;, and the music proved so popular there was demand for a national tour. Eventually, a few cities were chosen to perform in as the composer was too busy to commit to more. The romantic leitmotif shared by Miles and Maya is excerpted from &quot;Symbiosis&quot; by Claus Ogerman and Bill Evans.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Sideways&quot; has an approval rating of 97% based on 233 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Charming, thoughtful, and often funny, &quot;Sideways&quot; is a decidedly mature road trip comedy full of excellent performances.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Time Out&quot; described the film as &quot;intelligent, funny and moving&quot;, and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it four stars out of four, writing that &quot;what happens during the seven days adds up to the best human comedy of the year – comedy, because it is funny, and human, because it is surprisingly moving&quot;.

With the exception of Giamatti, who had already starred in the critically acclaimed film &quot;American Splendor&quot; (2003), the film was a career breakthrough for the stars. Church and Madsen were each nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award, and Academy Award for their performances, winning the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award and Independent Spirit Award for their respective categories. Giamatti was described as &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Character Actor&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 2005, Sandra Oh went on to star in the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, for which she won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and one Golden Globe Award.

&quot;Sideways&quot; was ranked 494th on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. &quot;Total Film&quot; put &quot;Sideways&quot; on its list of 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America also ranked its script as the 90th greatest ever written.

==Stage and musical adaptations==
In 2019, it was announced that &quot;Sideways&quot; was scheduled to be adapted for a stage musical. Kathleen Marshall is expected to be the director and choreographer for the musical, which was aiming for a spring or summer 2020 tryout in a regional venue prior to Broadway. The musical will have a book by Rex Pickett and the score by Anthony Leigh Adams.

A play adapted by author Rex Pickett from the &quot;Sideways&quot; novel was produced at multiple theaters in the United States and the United Kingdom, including at the La Jolla Playhouse.

In addition to the musical, it was reported that Pickett had written screenplays based on his two &quot;Sideways&quot; sequels already in print, &quot;Vertical&quot; and &quot;Sideways 3 Chile&quot;.

==Accolades==
As of 2022, Payne and Taylor are the only two screenwriters to ever sweep the rarest achievements known as &quot;The Big Four&quot; critics awards (LAFCA, NBR, NYFCC, NSFC), in addition to winning the Oscar, Globe, BAFTA, WGA, and Critic&#x27;s Choice Awards for the film.
==Japanese remake==
Fox International Productions and Fuji TV released a Japanese-language remake of the film in October 2009, サイドウェイズ, often rendered in Romaji as &quot;Saidoweizu&quot;. The film is directed by Cellin Gluck and stars Katsuhisa Namase, Fumiyo Kohinata, Kyōka Suzuki, and Rinko Kikuchi, and has a soundtrack composed and performed by Hawaiian-born ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro.

The remake shifts the setting of the film to Napa Valley. Although listed as an executive producer, Payne was not involved with the remake, although he gave it his blessing. Giamatti declined an invitation to make an unspecified cameo appearance in the film.

==Possible sequel==
Pickett has written three sequel books to &quot;Sideways&quot;, the second of which being &quot;Vertical&quot; (2010) which follows Miles and Jack on a road trip to Oregon with Miles&#x27; mother. Fox Searchlight retain the film rights to the characters, but Payne has expressed disinterest in directing a sequel to &quot;Sideways&quot;, and no further adaptations have been made.

<doc id="1144193" wikidata="Q2895878" url="?curid=1144193" title="Albert Benjamin Simpson">
<text>Albert Benjamin Simpson (December 15, 1843 – October 29, 1919), also known as A. B. Simpson, was a Canadian preacher, theologian, author, and founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&amp;MA), an evangelical denomination with an emphasis on global evangelism that has been characterized as being Keswickian in theology.

==Early life ==
Simpson was born in Bayview, near Cavendish, Prince Edward Island, Canada, as the third son and fourth child of James Simpson Jr. and Janet Clark. Author Harold H. Simpson has gathered an extensive genealogy of Cavendish families in &quot;Cavendish: Its History, Its People&quot;. His research establishes the Clark family (A. B. Simpson&#x27;s mother&#x27;s side) as one of the founding families of Cavendish in 1790, along with the Simpson family, and he traces common ancestors between Albert B. Simpson and Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;.

The young Albert was raised in a strict Calvinistic Scottish Presbyterian and Puritan tradition. His conversion of faith began under the ministry of Henry Grattan Guinness, a visiting evangelist from Ireland, during the revival of 1859. Simpson spent some time in the Chatham, Ontario, area and received his theological training in Toronto at Knox College, University of Toronto.

==Presbyterian ministry==
After graduating in 1865, Simpson was subsequently ordained in the Canada Presbyterian Church, the largest of the Presbyterian groups in Canada that merged after his departure for the United States. At age 21, he accepted a call to the large Knox Presbyterian Church (closed in 1971) in nearby Hamilton, Ontario.

In December 1873, at age 30, Simpson left Canada and assumed the pulpit of the largest Presbyterian church in Louisville, Kentucky, the Chestnut Street Presbyterian Church. It was in Louisville that he first conceived of preaching the gospel to the common man by building a simple tabernacle for that purpose. Despite his success at the Chestnut Street Church, Simpson was frustrated by their reluctance to embrace this burden for wider evangelistic endeavor.

In 1880, Simpson was called to the Thirteenth Street Presbyterian Church in New York City where he immediately began reaching out to the world with the gospel. In August 1881, he experienced divine healing of a heart problem. In October 1881, he adopted the vision of believer&#x27;s baptism as a symbol of commitment and was baptized by immersion in a Baptist church. After discussing his change in beliefs at his church, he decided to leave it.

==Evangelical ministry==
In 1881 he began an independent gospel ministry to the many new immigrants and the neglected masses of New York City. Beside active evangelistic work in the church, he published in 1882 a missionary journal, &quot;The Gospel in All Lands&quot;, the first missionary journal with pictures. Simpson also founded and began publishing an illustrated magazine entitled &quot;The Word, Work, and World&quot;. By 1911, this magazine became known as &quot;The Alliance Weekly&quot;, then &quot;Alliance Life.&quot; It is the official publication of The Christian and Missionary Alliance, in the US and Canada.

In 1882, Simpson began informal training classes in order to reach &quot;the neglected peoples of the world with the neglected resources of the church&quot;. By 1883, a formal program was in place and ministers and missionaries were being trained in a multi-cultural context (This school was the beginning of Nyack College and Alliance Theological Seminary).

In 1885, he was invited to the International Convention of Holiness and Divine Healing in London, by the American pastor William Boardman, author of &quot;The Higher Christian Life&quot;. He taught about holiness and especially a sermon known as &quot;Himself&quot;, that describes the sanctification as a focus on Christ himself and on his work on the cross.

In 1889, Simpson and his church family moved into their new home at the corner of 44th St. and 8th Av. called the New York Tabernacle. This became the base not only of his ministry of evangelism in the city, but also of his growing work of worldwide missions.

==Teaching==
In 1887, he began a series of sermons called “Fourfold Gospel” (“4-sided Gospel” or “Full Gospel”) in New York. According to him, this concept represents the 4 aspects of the ministry of Jesus Christ: &quot;Jesus our Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming King&quot;. The Fourfold Gospel is symbolized in the logo of the C&amp;MA: the Cross (Savior), the Laver (Sanctifier), the Pitcher (Healer), and the Crown (Coming King). He came to his special emphasis in ministry through his absolute Christ-centeredness in doctrine and experience.

Albert Benjamin Simpson was largely Keswickian, teaching the doctrine of entire sanctification heralded by the Higher Life movement. Simpson, however, departed from traditional Keswickian teaching in his view of progressive sanctification and rejection of suppressionism.

Plagued by illness for much of his life since childhood, Simpson believed he experienced divine healing after understanding it to be part of the blessing of abiding in Christ as Life and healing. He emphasized healing in his Fourfold Gospel and usually devoted one meeting a week for teaching, testimonies and prayer on these lines. Although such teaching isolated him (and the C&amp;MA) from the mainline churches that either did not emphasize or outright rejected healing, Simpson was uncompromising in his beliefs.

Simpson&#x27;s heart for evangelism was to become the driving force behind the creation of the C&amp;MA. Initially, the Christian and Missionary Alliance was not founded as a denomination, but as an organized movement of world evangelism.

In his 1890 book, &quot;A Larger Christian Life&quot;, Simpson discussed his vision for the church:

Simpson composed the lyrics of over 120 hymns, 77 of which appear in the C&amp;MA&#x27;s 1962 hymnal, &quot;Hymns of the Christian Life&quot;, co-edited with R. Kelso Carter&quot;.&quot;

His missionary vision is illustrated by these words of his hymn, &quot;The Missionary Cry&quot;:

At the turn of the 20th century, numerous Alliance members began adopting Pentecostal beliefs as a result of the widespread experience of tongues and other spiritual manifestations within the Alliance movement and at Alliance meetings. While Simpson remained an ardent proponent of the doctrine of Spirit Baptism that was a central teaching in late nineteenth-century evangelicalism, he became publicly critical of various practices within the Pentecostal movement that he considered excessive. In particular, Simpson publicly challenged the emerging Pentecostal teaching that &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; was the sole acceptable evidence of baptism with the Holy Spirit. Notwithstanding his public criticism, however, in his private spiritual life, Simpson sought for the gift of tongues. While he did not ever speak in tongues, he did, in the course of his seeking, have other ecstatic experiences of the kind that often bore the criticism of Pentecostal excessiveness, such as an experience he described in his private journal, saying, &quot;The Spirit came with a baptism of Holy laughter for an hour or more and I am waiting for all He has yet to give and manifest.&quot;

==Death==
A. B. Simpson died in 1919 and his wife (née Margaret L. Henry) died in 1924. They are buried on the Rockland County Campus of Nyack College in Nyack, New York.

== Legacy ==
A number of C&amp;MA churches bear Simpson&#x27;s name, including Simpson University in Redding, California; the Albert B. Simpson school in Lima, Peru; the A. B. Simpson Alliance School in Zamboanga City, Philippines; Sekolah Tinggi Teologi Simpson (Simpson Theological College) in Ungaran, Indonesia; and the Simpson Memorial Church in Jamalpur, Ahmedabad, India. Established in 1923, its centenary celebration was held from May 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024.

<doc id="1144196" wikidata="Q2801375" url="?curid=1144196" title="Comprehensive National Power">
<text>Comprehensive National Power (CNP; , pinyin: &quot;zōnghé guólì&quot;) is a measure of the general power of a nation-state. It is a putative measure, important in the contemporary political thought of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the 1980s onwards and first introduced into official documents in 1992.

CNP can be calculated numerically by combining various quantitative indices to create a single number held to measure the power of a nation-state. These indices take into account military, political, economic and cultural factors.

== About ==
Inspired by F. Clifford German, J. David Singer, Stuart Bremer and John Stuckey, A.F.K. Organski and Jacek Kugler, and Ray Cline&#x27;s understanding and formulas for national power assessment. It builds upon concepts such as superpower and regional power, as well as soft power, hard power and smart power.

A 1995 definition of CNP refers to it as &quot;the totality of a country&#x27;s economic, military and political power in a given period. It signals the country&#x27;s comprehensive development level and its position in the international system.&quot;

There are a number of methods for calculating CNP devised by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chinese Military Academy, Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations and independent Chinese scholars.

== National strategic resources ==
Michael Porter lists five major resources, that is, physical, human, infrastructure, knowledge and capital resources. Accordingly, the national strategic resources are divided into eight categories, with 23 indictors. Those categories constitute CNP:

* Economic resources
* Natural resources
* Capital resources
* Knowledge and Technology resources
* Government resources
* Military resources
* International resources
* Cultural resources

== Adaptations ==
A fairly simplistic and effective index was developed by Chin-Lung Chang. It uses critical mass, economic capacity and military capacity. Due to its indicators, it is often repeatable and easy to define, making it comparable to the Human Development Index in understanding and reliability.

<text>The Sangihe tarsier (Tarsius sangirensis), also known as Sangihe Island tarsier, is a small primate found on Sangir Island, which is located about 200 kilometers north-east of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. In 2008 a population of the Sangihe tarsier was determined to be a distinct species, the Siau Island tarsier (&quot;Tarsius tumpara&quot;). Locally in the Sangihe dialect of Sangir language, tarsiers are called Senggasi or Higo.

== Taxonomy ==
It was first assigned species status in 1896 by Adolf Meyer. It was later classified as a subspecies of the spectral tarsier &quot;T. spectrum&quot; by Hill and remained so until recently. Today it is recognized as a distinct species. The Siau Island tarsier, &quot;Tarsius tumpara&quot;, from Siau Island was formerly considered a population of the Sangihe tarsier, but was determined to be a separate species in 2008. There is still much debate on what is considered a species and a subspecies in the family Tarsiidae.

== Description ==
The large, round, forward-facing, pale-chestnut-colored eyes and elongated digits and tarsus are basic characteristics of the Sangihe tarsier. It is a very small primate weighing between 100 and 120 grams. It has sharp teeth, since it strictly eats animal matter. The tails are very long compared to body size and are used for support while stationary but are not truly prehensile in nature. Upper pelage is yellowish brown with dark-grey bases. Lower parts of it are a dullish-white with a light-grey base. Its eyes are immobile but it has the ability to rotate its head 180 degrees. The best way to distinguish this species from other tarsier species is by the amount of fur on its tail, and its &quot;acoustics&quot; (calls). The Sangihe tail has a sparse covering of dorsal fur, and does not have scales underneath.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Sangihe tarsier is endemic to the Sangihe Islands in Indonesia which is only 547 km2. It favors primary-growth forest but also fares well in secondary-growth forest. It also has been found in scrub habitats, coconut plantations, and in some cases agricultural areas. However, researchers are not sure if the populations found in agricultural areas are due to source-sink dynamic. All tarsiers live within 10 latitudinal degrees of the equator and require humid conditions, at least 50% humidity.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The mating pattern is monogamous or polygamous. It tends to be solitary or lives in small groups of 2–6. Groups mainly consist of the parents and offspring. Little is known about their specific mating patterns and reproduction development. What is known is based on better-documented species. It normally gives birth to a single offspring. There is little sexual dimorphism. It is a nocturnal species, which makes it even harder to document. Most tarsiers are relatively silent creatures and only make chirping sounds. Chirping can be mostly heard when males are trying to mate with females. Most of its communication is through scent, such as urine.

=== Diet ===
It eats mainly insects such as grasshoppers and beetles. It is occasionally seen eating small vertebrates like lizards. Tarsiers are the only known primates that are completely carnivorous. The digestive tract is very simple and short. It does not forage for insects like other insectivores but instead sits and waits. Once prey is spotted it will use its hands to grab it or leap and catch it.

== Conservation ==
The Sangihe tarsier is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is listed as an Appendix II species under CITES. Currently there are no specific conservation programs for this species of tarsier. There is also a lack of nature reserves located in its native land. It is very difficult to have any type of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation for this species, since it does not fare well outside their natural habitat. Since little is known about the species&#x27; reproduction patterns, there are not any breeding programs currently. Shekelle and Salim made some proposals on better protection for this species along with the Siau Island tarsier. Such actions include more investments on improving &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation, mimic sanctuaries found for a subspecies of the Philippine tarsier &quot;Carlito syrichta fraterculus&quot; along with tarsier-tracking activities. Some of the above would increase ecotourism in the area and improve economics in the area. The authors also recommend increasing awareness of the species and advising people on how to better manage their lands to improve chances of the survival of the species.

=== Threats ===
The population is thought to be between 1,505 and 52,734. Accurate numbers are hard to estimate due to cloud coverage over its range. Some of its natural threats include birds, snakes, and the giant civet. Mount Awu can also be considered a natural threat as well, since it is an active and deadly volcano on the island. Anthropogenic causes include habitat loss or fragmentation, the introduction of cats and dogs to the island, population density increases in its territory, and pet trade.

<text>The Colossus of Prora, commonly known as simply &quot;Prora&quot;, is a building complex in the municipality of Binz on the island of Rügen, Germany. It was built by Nazi Germany between 1936 and 1939 as part of the Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude or KdF) project. It consisted of eight identical buildings and was in length parallel to the beach, with the surviving structures stretching .

Although the buildings were planned as a holiday resort, construction was not completed, and they were not used for this purpose. Prora, as it was known, was however used largely by the Nazi Party for propaganda, with the supposed strength and power displayed in the construction effort of the complex likened by the party to that of themselves. After World War II, the complex found various military uses, first by the Soviet Army, then by the East German Volksarmee, and then by the German Bundeswehr. Today, it houses a large youth hostel, a hotel, and holiday apartments.

==Location==
Prora lies on an extensive bay between the Sassnitz and Binz regions, known as the Prorer Wiek, on the narrow heath (the &quot;Prora&quot;) which separates the lagoon of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden from the Baltic Sea. The buildings extended over a length of and are roughly from the beach. The coast offers a long flat sand beach which stretches from Binz to the ferry port. This beach was thus an ideal location for the establishment of a seaside resort.

==Plans==

The Strength Through Joy program was designed to attract the working classwho had during the Weimar Republic been the power base of the Social Democrats and, to a lesser extent, the Communiststo the Nazi Party by offering numerous cultural events and mass tourism at affordable prices. They also presented an opportunity for the inculcation of Nazi ideology through constant indoctrination by propaganda. Founded in November 1933, in the year 1934, 400,000 people took Strength Through Joy package tours, a number which rose to 1.7 million by 1937, not to mention 7 million who availed themselves of weekend excursions and 1.6 million who participated in organized hikes.

Robert Ley, head of the German Labour Frontof which Strength Through Joy was a subsidiaryenvisioned Prora as a parallel to Butlins, which were British &quot;holiday camps&quot; designed to provide affordable holidays for the average worker. Prora was designed to house 20,000 holidaymakers, under the idea that every worker deserved a holiday at the beach. Designed by Clemens Klotz, who won a design competition overseen by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s chief architect Albert Speer, all rooms were planned to overlook the sea, while corridors and sanitation are located on the landward side. Each room of was to have two beds, a wardrobe, and a sink. There were communal toilets, showers, and bathrooms on each floor.

Hitler&#x27;s plans for Prora were much more ambitious. He wanted a gigantic sea resort, the &quot;most mighty and large one to ever have existed&quot;, holding 20,000 beds. In the middle, a huge building was to be erected, which would be a grand hall for speeches and concerts. At the same time, Hitler wanted the complex to have the ability to be converted into a military hospital in case of war. Hitler insisted that the plans of a giant indoor arena by architect Erich zu Putlitz were to be included. Putlitz&#x27;s Festival Hall was intended to be able to accommodate all 20,000 guests at the same time. His plans included two wave-swimming pools, a cinema, and a theatre. A large dock for passenger ships was also planned.

The designs won a &quot;Grand Prix&quot; award at the 1937 Paris World Exposition.

== Construction ==
Construction began in 1936 and during the few years that Prora was under construction, all major construction companies of the Reich and nearly 9,000 workers were involved in this project. By 1938, construction costs had reached (equivalent to € in 2009). 

With the onset of World War II in 1939, building on Prora stopped and the construction workers transferred to the V-Weapons plant at Peenemünde. The eight housing blocks and the theatre and cinema remained empty shells. The swimming pools and festival hall never materialised. If the complex had been completed, it would have been the largest holiday resort in the world.

== Usage ==
===World War II===
During the Allied bombing campaign, many people from Hamburg took refuge in one of the housing blocks, and later refugees from the east of Germany were housed there. By the end of the war, these buildings housed female auxiliary personnel for the Luftwaffe.

=== Cold War===
In 1945 the Soviet Army took control of the region and established a military base at Prora. The Soviet Army&#x27;s 2nd Artillery Brigade occupied block 5 of Prora from 1945 to 1955. The Soviet military then stripped all usable materials from the building. In the late 1940s two of the housing blocksone at the North and one at the Southwere demolished and the remains were mostly removed.

In the late 1950s, the East German military rebuilt several of the buildings. Since the buildings had been stripped to the bare brick in the late 1940s, most of the exterior and interior finish that can now be seen was done under East German control. After the formation of the German Democratic Republic&#x27;s (GDR&#x27;s) National People&#x27;s Army in 1956, the buildings became a restricted military area housing several East German Army units. The most prominent were the elite 40. Fallschirmjägerbataillon Willi Sänger (40th Parachute Battalion &quot;Willi Sänger&quot;) which was housed in block 5 from 1960 to 1982. Block 4 on the north side was used for urban combat training by the Parachute Battalion and others. Large sections remain as ruins to this day. 

Also housed in the building from 1982 to 1990 was the East German Army Construction Battalion &quot;Mukran&quot;, where conscientious objectors served as noncombatant Construction Soldiers () to meet their military service obligation. A part of the building also served as the East German Army&#x27;s &quot;Walter Ulbricht&quot; convalescent home.

===Unified Germany ===
After German reunification in 1990, the National People&#x27;s Army was absorbed into the West German Bundeswehr, that took over the building. Initially, consideration was given to demolishing the buildings, but it was later given landmark protection and a tax break offered to developers to renovate it. Parts of the building were used from 1990 to 1992 by the Military Technical School of the Bundeswehr. From 1992 to 1994 a part of the building was used to house asylum seekers from the Balkans.

Beginning in early 1993, the facility was empty and the buildings were subject to decay and vandalism. An exception to this was Block 3, Prora Center, which from 1995 to 2005 housed a variety of museums, special exhibitions, and a gallery. Between 1993 and 1999 the site served as one of the largest youth hostels in Europe.

Since 2000, the Documentation Centre Prora has been located at the southern edge of the fairground buildings. This center documents the construction and use history of the building. Discussed here are both the background of the project and its appropriation for Nazi propaganda.

== Sale and redevelopment ==
In 2004, following more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to sell the site as a whole, the blocks of the building began being sold off individually for various uses. On 23 September 2004, Block 6 sold for €625,000 to an unknown bidder. On 23 February 2005, Block 3, the former Museum Mile, was sold to Inselbogen GmbH, which announced that the building would be used as a hotel. In October 2006, blocks 1 and 2 were sold to Prora Projektentwicklungs GmbH which announced plans of converting the buildings into shops and apartments. However, Block 1 was re-offered for sale at an auction on 31 March 2012 and was purchased by a Berlin investor for €2.75 million.

In November 2006, the Federal Agency for Real Estate purchased Block 5. With financial support from the federal government and the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern it planned to establish a youth hostel in the building. Located in the northernmost part of the complex, it was divided into five contiguous parts. 

In late 2008, plans were approved to have Prora fill its original purpose and turn it into a modern tourist resort. The council set out plans to build enough living space to house 3,000 people, as well as a youth hostel, and amenities for tourists. Kerstin Kassner, a local councillor, compared Prora&#x27;s shore with a &quot;Caribbean beach&quot;. However, the decision met with some skepticism from Binz locals, who felt that there were already too many tourists in the region, and Heike Tagsold, a Prora historian, who said that the town&#x27;s past made it an inappropriate location for tourists. Nevertheless, in 2011 the long-planned large youth hostel with 402 beds in 96 rooms opened; it is the largest youth hostel in Germany and has been popular. A possible expansion of the facility aimed toward budget-minded tourists has been proposed.

In September 2010, plans were announced by a German-Austrian investor group to renovate blocks 1 and 2 as housing for the elderly and a hotel with 300 beds that includes tennis courts, and swimming pool, and a small shopping centre. The investment costs are estimated at €100 million.

=== Metropole Marketing ===
In 2013, a German company, Metropole Marketing, bought the rights to refurbish Prora and market the units as summer homes. By that year, refurbished apartments in the so-called Colossus were on sale for as much as €700,000 each. The completion date was estimated as 2016. In 2016, the first of the new apartments opened in Block 1. The Prora Solitaire hotel in Block 2 opened for the summer of 2016, and some reconstructed flats were for sale in that Block by mid 2017. At that time, four of the buildings were in the process of redevelopment, a fifth was used as a youth hostel while the remaining three remained in ruins.
A November 2017 update indicated that most of the units (flats) in Block 1 had been sold, having been marketed as summer homes for those who live in Hamburg and Berlin. Many were listed by owners as short term rentals.

==In popular culture==
Prora was featured in the video game &quot;Civilization V&quot;, specifically within the expansion pack &quot;Civilization V: Brave New World&quot;. It appears in the game as a world wonder associated with the ideology of Autocracy.

It was the setting of the 2012 short film &quot;Prora&quot;.

Prora is the setting for the first and fifth of the series of crime novels by David Young set in pre-unification East Germany: &quot;Stasi Child&quot; (2016) and &quot;Stasi Winter&quot; (2020). Both stories feature a fictional &quot;Jugendwerkhof&quot;, a workhouse for juvenile delinquents, located in the planned holiday resort.

<text>In immunology, a memory B cell (MBC) is a type of B lymphocyte that forms part of the adaptive immune system. These cells develop within germinal centers of the secondary lymphoid organs. Memory B cells circulate in the blood stream in a quiescent state, sometimes for decades. Their function is to memorize the characteristics of the antigen that activated their parent B cell during initial infection such that if the memory B cell later encounters the same antigen, it triggers an accelerated and robust secondary immune response. Memory B cells have B cell receptors (BCRs) on their cell membrane, identical to the one on their parent cell, that allow them to recognize antigen and mount a specific antibody response.

== Development and activation ==

=== T cell dependent mechanisms ===
In a T-cell dependent development pathway, naïve follicular B cells are activated by antigen-presenting follicular B helper T cells (TFH) during the initial infection, or primary immune response. Naïve B cells circulate through follicles in secondary lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen and lymph nodes) where they can be activated by a floating foreign peptide brought in through the lymph or by antigen presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs). B cells may also be activated by binding foreign antigen in the periphery where they then move into the secondary lymphoid organs. A signal transduced by the binding of the peptide to the B cell causes the cells to migrate to the edge of the follicle bordering the T cell area.

The B cells internalize the foreign peptides, break them down, and express them on class II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCII), which are cell surface proteins. Within the secondary lymphoid organs, most of the B cells will enter B-cell follicles where a germinal center will form. Most B cells will eventually differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells within the germinal center. The TFHs that express T cell receptors (TCRs) cognate to the peptide (i.e. specific for the peptide-MHCII complex) at the border of the B cell follicle and T-cell zone will bind to the MHCII ligand. The T cells will then express the CD40 ligand (CD40L) molecule and will begin to secrete cytokines which cause the B cells to proliferate and to undergo class switch recombination, a mutation in the B cell&#x27;s genetic coding that changes their immunoglobulin type. Class switching allows memory B cells to secrete different types of antibodies in future immune responses. The B cells then either differentiate into plasma cells, germinal center B cells, or memory B cells depending on the expressed transcription factors. The activated B cells that expressed the transcription factor Bcl-6 will enter B-cell follicles and undergo germinal center reactions.

Once inside the germinal center, the B cells undergo proliferation, followed by mutation of the genetic coding region of their BCR, a process known as somatic hypermutation. The mutations will either increase or decrease the affinity of the surface receptor for a particular antigen, a progression called affinity maturation. After acquiring these mutations, the receptors on the surface of the B cells (B cell receptors) are tested within the germinal center for their affinity to the current antigen. B cell clones with mutations that have increased the affinity of their surface receptors receive survival signals via interactions with their cognate TFH cells. The B cells that do not have high enough affinity to receive these survival signals, as well as B cells that are potentially auto-reactive, will be selected against and die through apoptosis. These processes increase variability at the antigen binding sites such that every newly generated B cell has a unique receptor.

After differentiation, memory B cells relocate to the periphery of the body where they will be more likely to encounter antigen in the event of a future exposure. Many of the circulating B cells become concentrated in areas of the body that have a high likelihood of coming into contact with antigen, such as the Peyer&#x27;s patch.

The process of differentiation into memory B cells within the germinal center is not yet fully understood. Some researchers hypothesize that differentiation into memory B cells occurs randomly. Other hypotheses propose that the transcription factor NF-κB and the cytokine IL-24 are involved in the process of differentiation into memory B cells. An additional hypothesis states that the B cells with relatively lower affinity for antigen will become memory B cells, in contrast to B cells with relatively higher affinity that will become plasma cells.

=== T cell independent mechanisms ===
Not all B cells present in the body have undergone somatic hypermutations. IgM+ memory B cells that have not undergone class switch recombination demonstrate that memory B cells can be produced independently of the germinal centers.

== Primary response ==
Upon infection with a pathogen, many B cells will differentiate into the plasma cells, also called effector B cells, which produce a first wave of protective antibodies and help clear infection. Plasma cells secrete antibodies specific for the pathogens but they cannot respond upon secondary exposure. A fraction of the B cells with BCRs cognate to the antigen differentiate into memory B cells that survive long-term in the body. The memory B cells can maintain their BCR expression and will be able to respond quickly upon secondary exposure.

== Secondary response and memory ==
The memory B cells produced during the primary immune response are specific to the antigen involved during the first exposure. In a secondary response, the memory B cells specific to the antigen or similar antigens will respond. When memory B cells reencounter their specific antigen, they proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, which then respond to and clear the antigen. The memory B cells that do not differentiate into plasma cells at this point can reenter the germinal centers to undergo further class switching or somatic hypermutation for further affinity maturation. Differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells is far faster than differentiation by naïve B cells, which allows memory B cells to produce a more efficient secondary immune response. The efficiency and accumulation of the memory B cell response is the foundation for vaccines and booster shots.

The phenotype of memory cells that prognosticate plasma cells or germinal center cells fate has been discovered  few years ago. Based on expression microarray comparisons between memory B cells and naïve B cells, it was identified that there are several surface proteins, such as CD80, PD-L2 and CD73 that are only expressed on the memory B cells, so they also serve to divide this cells in multiple phenotypic subsets. Moreover, it has been shown that the memory cells that express CD80, PD-L2 and CD73 are more likely to become plasma cells. On the other hand, the cells which don´t have these type of markers are more likely to form germinal center cells. The IgM+  memory B cells do not express CD80 or CD73, whereas IgG+ express them. Moreover, IgG+ are more likely to differenciate into antibody-secreting cells.

== Lifespan ==
Memory B cells can survive for decades, which gives them the capacity to respond to multiple exposures to the same antigen. The long-lasting survival is hypothesized to be a result of certain anti-apoptosis genes that are more highly expressed in memory B cells than other subsets of B cells. Additionally, the memory B cell does not need to have continual interaction with the antigen nor with T cells in order to survive long-term.

However, it is true that the lifespan of individual memory B cells remains poorly defined, although they have a critical role in long-term immunity. In one study using a B cell receptor (BCR) transgenic system (it was a H chain transgenic mouse model which lacked secreted Ig, so it didn´t deposit Ag-containing immune complexes), it was shown that the number of memory B cells remain constant for a period of around 8–20 weeks after the immunization. It was also estimated that the half-life of memory B cells was between 8–10 weeks, after doing an experiment in which the cells were treated in vivo with bromodeoxyuridine. In other experiments in mouse, it has been shown that the lifespan of memory B cells is at least 9 times greater than the lifespan of a follicular naïve B cell.

== Markers ==
Memory B cells are typically distinguished by the cell surface marker CD27, although some subsets do not express CD27. Memory B cells that lack CD27 are generally associated with exhausted B cells or certain autoimmune conditions such as HIV, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis.

Because B cells have typically undergone class switching, they can express a range of immunoglobulin molecules. Some specific attributes of particular immunoglobulin molecules are described below:  

* IgM: Memory B cells that express IgM can be found concentrated in the tonsils, Peyer&#x27;s patch, and lymph nodes. This subset of memory B cells is more likely to proliferate and reenter the germinal center during a secondary immune response.
* IgG: Memory B cells that express IgG typically differentiate into plasma cells.
* IgE: Memory B cells that express IgE are very rare in healthy individuals. This may occur because B cells that express IgE more frequently differentiate into plasma cells rather than memory B cells 
* IgD only: Memory B cells that express IgD are very rare. B cells with only IgD are found concentrated in the tonsils.

It is important to mention the importance of integration of signalling pathways related to the receptors of BCRs and TLRs in order to modulate the production of the antibodies by the expansion of the memory B cells. Therefore, there are different factors that provide the information in order to secret different types of antibodies. It has been demonstrated that the production of specific-IgG1, anaphylactic-IgG1 and total-IgE depends on the signal produce by TLR2 and Myd88. Moreover, the signal produce by TLR4 when it is stimulated by natterins (protein obtained from &quot;T. nattereri&quot; fish venom) accelerates the synthesis of the antibody IgE acting as an adjuvant, as it was shown in an in vivo experiment with mice.

The receptor CCR6 is generally a marker of B cells that will eventually differentiate into MBCs. This receptor detects chemokines, which are chemical messengers that allow the B cell to move within the body. Memory B cells may have this receptor to allow them to move out of the germinal center and into the tissues where they have a higher probability of encountering antigen.

It has been shown that memory B cells have high level expression of CCR6 as well as an increased chemotactic response to the CCR6 ligand (CCL20) in comparison with naïve B cells. Nevertheless, the primary humoral response and the maintenance of the memory B cells are not affected in CCR6-deficient mice. However, there is not an effective secondary response  from the memory B cells when there is a reexposure of the antigen if the cells do not express CCR6. Therefore we can confirm that CCR6 is essential for the ability of memory B cells to be recalled to their cognate antigen as well as for the appropriate anatomical positioning of these cells.

== Subsets ==

=== Germinal center independent memory B cells ===
This subset of cells differentiates from activated B cells into memory B cells before entering the germinal center. B cells that have a high level of interaction with TFH within the B cell follicle have a higher propensity of entering the germinal center. The B cells that develop into memory B cells independently from germinal centers likely experience CD40 and cytokine signaling from T cells. Class switching can still occur prior to interaction with the germinal center, while somatic hypermutation only occurs after interaction with the germinal center. The lack of somatic hypermutation is hypothesized to be beneficial; a lower level of affinity maturation means that these memory B cells are less specialized to a specific antigen and may be able to recognize a wider range of antigens.

T-independent memory B cells

T-independent memory B cells are a subset called B1 cells. These cells generally reside in the peritoneal cavity. When reintroduced to antigen, some of these B1 cells can differentiate into memory B cells without interacting with a T cell. These B cells produce IgM antibodies to help clear infection.

T-bet memory B cells

T-bet B cells are a subset that have been found to express the transcription factor T-bet. T-bet is associated with class switching. T-bet B cells are also thought to be important in immune responses against intracellular bacterial and viral infections.

== Vaccination ==
Vaccines are based on the notion of immunological memory. The preventative injection of a non-pathogenic antigen into the organism allows the body to generate a durable immunological memory. The injection of the antigen leads to an antibody response followed by the production of memory B cells. These memory B cells are promptly reactivated upon infection with the antigen and can effectively protect the organism from disease.

Long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells are responsible for the long-term humoral immunity elicited by most vaccines. An experiment has been carried in order to observe the longevity of memory B cells after vaccination, in this case with the smallpox vaccine (DryVax), which was selected due to the fact that smallpox was eradicated, so the immune memory to smallpox is a useful benchmark to understand the longevity of the immune memory B cells in the absence of restimulation. The study concluded that the specific memory B cells are maintained for decades, indicating that the immunological memory is long-lived in the B cell compartment after a robust initial antigen exposure.

<doc id="1144206" wikidata="Q1974793" url="?curid=1144206" title="Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)">
<text>In a cellular automaton, a Garden of Eden is a configuration that has no predecessor. It can be the initial configuration of the automaton but cannot arise in any other way.
John Tukey named these configurations after the Garden of Eden in Abrahamic religions, which was created out of nowhere.

A Garden of Eden is determined by the state of every cell in the automaton (usually a one- or two-dimensional infinite square lattice of cells). However, for any Garden of Eden there is a finite pattern (a subset of cells and their states, called an &quot;orphan&quot;) with the same property of having no predecessor, no matter how the remaining cells are filled in.
A configuration of the whole automaton is a Garden of Eden if and only if it contains an orphan.
For one-dimensional cellular automata, orphans and Gardens of Eden can be found by an efficient algorithm, but for higher dimensions this is an undecidable problem. Nevertheless, computer searches have succeeded in finding these patterns in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life.

The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill asserts that a cellular automaton on the square grid, or on a tiling of any higher dimensional Euclidean space, has a Garden of Eden if and only if it has &quot;twins&quot;, two finite patterns that have the same successors whenever one is substituted for the other.

==Definitions==
A cellular automaton is defined by a grid of cells, a finite set of states that can be assigned to each cell, and an update rule.
Often, the grid of cells is the one- or two-dimensional infinite square lattice. The update rule determines the next state of each cell as a function of its current state and of the current states of certain other nearby cells (the &quot;neighborhood&quot; of the cell).
The neighborhood can be an arbitrary finite set of cells, but each two cells should have neighbors in the same relative positions and all cells must use the same update rule.
A &quot;configuration&quot; of the automaton is an assignment of a state to every cell.

The &quot;successor&quot; of a configuration is another configuration, formed by applying the update rule simultaneously to every cell.
The &quot;transition function&quot; of the automaton is the function that maps each configuration to its successor.
If the successor of configuration &quot;X&quot; is configuration &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;predecessor&quot; of &quot;Y&quot;.
A configuration may have zero, one, or more predecessors, but it always has exactly one successor.
A Garden of Eden is defined to be a configuration with zero predecessors.

A &quot;pattern&quot;, for a given cellular automaton, consists of a finite set of cells together with a state for each of those cells. A configuration contains a pattern when the states of the cells in the pattern are the same as the states of the same cells in the configuration (without translating the cells before matching them). The definition of predecessors of configurations can be extended to predecessors of patterns:
a predecessor of a pattern is just a configuration whose successor contains the pattern. An orphan, then, is a pattern with no predecessor.

== Searching for the Garden of Eden ==
For one-dimensional cellular automata, Gardens of Eden can be found by an efficient algorithm whose running time is polynomial in the size of the rule table of the automaton. For higher dimensions, determining whether a Garden of Eden exists is an undecidable problem, meaning that there is no algorithm that can be guaranteed to terminate and produce the correct answer. Nevertheless, in many cases it is possible to use the Garden of Eden theorem (below) to infer that a solution exists and then use a search algorithm to find one.

It would be possible for a computer program to search for orphan patterns by systematically examining all finite patterns, in order by increasing size, and by testing all possible predecessors for each pattern to determine whether it is in fact an orphan. However, the number of patterns that would need to be generated to find a Garden of Eden in this way is exponential in the area of the pattern. This enormous number of patterns would make this type of brute-force search prohibitively expensive, even for relatively small sizes of patterns.

 pioneered a more efficient computational approach for finding orphan patterns. His method is based on the theory of formal languages, and takes an amount of time that is exponential in the width of the pattern rather than its area. The key idea is that, for any fixed width, it is possible to construct a nondeterministic finite automaton that recognizes patterns of a given width that have a predecessor. The input symbols to this machine describe each row of the pattern, and the states of the machine describe the nearby rows of possible predecessors for the part of the pattern that has been input so far. One can construct from this machine another finite state machine that recognizes the complementary set, the patterns that do not have predecessors, by converting the nondeterministic finite state machine to a deterministic finite automaton by using the powerset construction, and then complementing its set of accepting states. Once a machine recognizing the complementary set has been constructed, one may test whether the language it recognizes is empty, by searching for a path from the start state to an accepting state. This path, if it exists, gives a row-by-row description of an orphan pattern.

Martin Gardner credits Alvy Ray Smith with the observation that the Garden of Eden theorem applies to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, and proves the existence of Gardens of Eden for this rule.
The first explicit Garden of Eden in Life, with its live cells fitting in a rectangle, was identified as a candidate to be a Garden of Eden by Roger Banks in 1971, and then verified by an exhaustive backtracking search for predecessors.
Subsequently, Hardouin-Duparc used his formal language approach to find the narrowest possible Gardens of Eden in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, with the bounding box for their live cells being only six cells wide.

The smallest known orphan pattern in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life (by area of its bounding box) was found by Steven Eker in April 2016. It has 57 living cells and fits in an 8×12 rectangle.

==Existence of orphans==
By definition, every orphan belongs to a Garden of Eden: extending an orphan to a configuration of the whole automaton, by choosing a state for each remaining cell arbitrarily, will always produce a Garden of Eden. But the reverse is also true: every Garden of Eden contains at least one orphan.
To prove this, Kari uses a topological argument, based on the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem according to which the transition functions of cellular automata are exactly the translation-invariant continuous functions on the space of configurations. Here, continuity is defined by assigning a discrete topology to the finite set of states of the automaton, and then using a product topology with one term in the product for each cell in the automaton to construct a topological space whose points are the automaton&#x27;s configurations. By Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem it is a compact space.

For each finite pattern, the set of configurations that contain the pattern is an open set in this topology, called a &quot;cylinder&quot;. The cylinders form a basis for the topology.
As Kari observes, the collection of configurations that are not Gardens of Eden is just the image of the transition function, so by the closed map lemma for compact spaces it is a closed set. The set of Gardens of Eden, correspondingly, is an open set. Because it is open and the cylinders form a basis, the set of Gardens of Eden can be represented as a union of cylinders.
Each of the cylinders in this union consists only of Gardens of Eden, so the pattern that determines each cylinder must be an orphan. If the set of Gardens of Eden is non-empty, there must be at least one cylinder in this union, so there must be at least one orphan. And any particular Garden of Eden must belong to one of these cylinders, and therefore must contain the orphan for that cylinder.

== The Garden of Eden theorem ==
In a cellular automaton, two finite patterns are &quot;twins&quot; if one can be substituted for the other wherever it appears, without changing future configurations. A cellular automaton is injective if every pair of distinct configurations of the automaton remain different after a step of the automaton, and locally injective if it has no twins. It is surjective if and only if every configuration has a predecessor; that is, if and only if it has no Garden of Eden configuration. An automaton that is both injective and surjective is called a reversible cellular automaton.

The Garden of Eden theorem, due to and , asserts that a cellular automaton in a Euclidean space is locally injective if and only if it is surjective. In other words, it asserts that a cellular automaton has a Garden of Eden, if and only if it has twins. More strongly, every non-locally-injective cellular automaton has an orphan pattern. An immediate corollary is that an injective cellular automaton must be surjective. Moore proved one direction of the theorem, that automata with twins have orphans; Myhill proved the converse, that an automaton with an orphan also has twins.

In the case of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, twins are much easier to find than orphans. For instance, a five-by-five block of dead cells and a five-by-five block with its center cell live and the remaining cells dead are twins: the state of the center cell cannot affect later configurations of the pattern. Thus, in this case, the Garden of Eden theorem allows the existence of a Garden of Eden to be demonstrated much more easily than by finding an explicit orphan pattern.

===Proof sketch===
The main idea of the proof of the theorem is to use a counting argument, to show that any failure of local injectivity (twin patterns) leads to an orphan pattern, and vice versa. In more detail, suppose for concreteness that the underlying lattice of the automaton is a two-dimensional square grid, that it has different cell states, that the twin patterns and both fit into an square, and that the radius of any cell&#x27;s neighborhood is at most . Then, in order to determine whether a pattern that fits within an square is an orphan, one need only look at the parts of potential predecessors that fit within an square and that do not contain pattern . But there are only
 of these potential predecessors. For sufficiently large values of this number is smaller than the number of potential orphans. Therefore, one of the potential orphans has no predecessor and is really an orphan; that is, non-injectivity implies non-surjectivity. Conversely (letting be the size of a bounding box of an orphan) a very similar counting argument shows that the number of patterns that fit within an square and do not contain an orphan is too small to provide a distinct successor to every starting pattern within an square, from which it follows that some two of the possible starting patterns are twins. Therefore, non-surjectivity implies local non-injectivity.

===Injectivity versus local injectivity===

The distinction between injectivity and local injectivity in the theorem is necessary, as there exist cellular automata that are locally injective but not injective. One example is Rule 90, the one-dimensional binary automaton whose update rule replaces each cell&#x27;s state with the exclusive or of its two neighbors. In this automaton, every state has four predecessors, so it is not injective but also has no Garden of Eden.

===With quiescent states===
In automata such as Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, there is a special &quot;quiescent&quot; state such that a quiescent cell whose neighborhood is entirely quiescent remains quiescent. In this case one may define a &quot;finite configuration&quot; to be a configuration with only finitely many non-quiescent cells. Any non-locally-injective cellular automaton with a quiescent state has Gardens of Eden that are themselves finite configurations, for instance any finite configuration that contains an orphan. It may also be possible for an automaton to have a finite configuration whose only predecessors are not finite (for instance, in Rule 90, a configuration with a single live cell has this property). However, the Garden of Eden theorem does not characterize the existence of such patterns.

===In non-Euclidean geometries===
In cellular automata defined over tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, or of higher-dimensional hyperbolic spaces, the counting argument in the proof of the Garden of Eden theorem does not work, because it depends implicitly on the property of Euclidean spaces that the boundary of a region grows less quickly than its volume as a function of the radius. There exist hyperbolic cellular automata that have twins but that do not have a Garden of Eden, and other hyperbolic cellular automata that have a Garden of Eden but do not have twins; these automata can be defined, for instance, in a rotation-invariant way on the uniform hyperbolic tilings in which three heptagons meet at each vertex, or in which four pentagons meet at each vertex.

However, the Garden of Eden theorem can be generalized beyond Euclidean spaces, to cellular automata defined on the elements of an amenable group. A weaker form of the Garden of Eden theorem asserts that every injective cellular automaton is surjective. It can be proven for sofic groups using the Ax–Grothendieck theorem, an analogous relation between injectivity and bijectivity in algebraic geometry. More generally, the groups for which this weaker form holds are called surjunctive groups. There are no known examples of groups that are not surjunctive.

== In fiction ==
In Greg Egan&#x27;s novel &quot;Permutation City&quot;, the protagonist uses a Garden of Eden configuration to create a situation in which a copy of himself can prove that he is living within a simulation. Previously all his simulated copies had found themselves in some variant of the &quot;real world&quot;; although they had memories of being simulated copies living in a simulation, there was always a simpler explanation for how those memories came to be. The Garden of Eden configuration, however, cannot occur except in an intelligently designed simulation. The religious parallels are intentional.

<doc id="1144211" wikidata="Q1471021" url="?curid=1144211" title="Perrier">
<text>Perrier ( , , ) is a French brand of natural bottled mineral water obtained at its source in Vergèze, located in the Gard &quot;département&quot;. Perrier was part of the Perrier Vittel Group SA, which became Nestlé Waters France after the acquisition of the company by Nestlé in 1992. Perrier is known for its carbonation and its distinctive green bottle.

==Overview==
The spring from which Perrier water is sourced is naturally carbonated, but the water and natural carbon dioxide gas are obtained independently. The water is then purified, and during bottling, the carbon dioxide gas is re-added so that the level of carbonation in bottled Perrier matches that of the Vergèze spring.

In 1990, Perrier removed the &quot;naturally sparkling&quot; claim from its bottles under pressure from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Since at least 2019, Perrier water is no longer &quot;reinforced with gas from the source&quot; but &quot;with the addition of carbon dioxide&quot;. According to the company, this change allows it to considerably reduce its total water consumption and reduce its ecological impact.

==History==
The spring in Southern France from which Perrier is drawn was originally known as &quot;Les Bouillens&quot; (The Bubbles). It had been used as a spa since Roman times. During 218 BC, Hannibal and his army, having passed through Spain en route to his intended conquest of Rome, decided to rest for a while at Les Bouillens, from which the men took water for refreshment. 

Perrier was first introduced to Britain during 1863. Local doctor Louis Perrier bought the spring in 1898 and operated a commercial spa there; he also bottled the water for sale. He later sold the spring to St John Harmsworth, a wealthy British visitor. Harmsworth was the younger brother of the newspaper magnates Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothermere. He had come to France to learn the language. Dr. Perrier showed him the spring, and he decided to buy it. He sold his share of the family newspapers to raise the money. Harmsworth closed the spa, as spas were becoming unfashionable. He renamed the spring &quot;Source Perrier&quot; and started bottling the water in distinctive green bottles. The shape was that of the Indian clubs which Harmsworth used for exercise.

Harmsworth marketed the product in Britain at a time when Frenchness was seen as chic and aspirational to the middle classes. It was advertised as the Champagne of mineral water. Advertising in newspapers like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; established the brand. For a time, 95% of sales were in Britain and the US.

Perrier&#x27;s reputation for purity suffered a blow in 1990 when a laboratory in North Carolina in the United States found benzene, a carcinogen, in several bottles. Perrier stated that it was an isolated incident of a worker having made a mistake in filtering and that the spring itself was unpolluted. The incident ultimately led to the worldwide withdrawal of the product, some 160 million bottles of Perrier.

Two years later in 1992, Perrier was bought by Nestlé, one of the world&#x27;s leading food and drink companies. Nestlé had to contend with competition from the Agnelli family for ownership of the business.

In 2004, a crisis erupted when Nestlé announced a restructuring plan for Perrier. The following year, Perrier was ordered to halt restructuring due to a failure to consult adequately with staff.

In April 2024, following reports that products had been contaminated with germs of possible faecal origin, an estimated 2.9 million bottles of Perrier water were destroyed before reaching the market. This was followed by an announcement in June that year that one-litre bottles of Perrier Vert would be pulled from the French market after a majority of wells used to capture the water at the Vergèze manufacturing site had their use terminated, suspended or diverted to other product lines, following a product safety inspection at the manufacturing site on 30 May conducted by government agencies.

==Bottling==
Perrier is available in 750 ml, 330 ml, and 200 ml glass bottles in Europe, as well as in 330 ml cans. In other markets, the 250 ml can is also available. Perrier bottles all have a distinctive &#x27;teardrop&#x27; shape and are a signature green colour. In August 2001, the company introduced a new bottling format using polyethylene terephthalate to offer Perrier in plastic, a change that was researched for 11 years to determine which material would best help retain both the water&#x27;s flavour and its purported &quot;50 million bubbles.&quot;

In 2013, Perrier celebrated its 150th anniversary by launching a limited edition series of bottles inspired by Andy Warhol.

In 2019, Perrier released Perrier ARTXTRA limited edition packaging featuring artwork of artist duo Dabsmyla to help support the contemporary artist community.

==Varieties==
Perrier comes in several flavours: Natural, Lemon, and Lime have been on the market for many years, and in 2007, Citron Lemon-Lime and Pamplemousse Rose (Pink Grapefruit) flavours debuted in the United States. In 2015, a Green Apple flavour was launched in France as well as the US. In 2016, a Mint flavour (Saveur Menthe) was introduced in France.

Since 2002, new varieties of Perrier have been introduced in France, for example, &quot;Eau de Perrier&quot; is less carbonated than the original, and comes in a blue bottle. &quot;Perrier Fluo&quot; comes in flavours such as ginger-cherry, peppermint, orange-lychee, raspberry, and ginger-lemon.

In 2017, Perrier introduced two new flavours, Perrier Strawberry and Perrier Watermelon, to their existing Lime, L’Orange, Pink Grapefruit, and Green Apple flavour.

==Distribution==
As of January 2013, Perrier was available in 140 countries, and almost 1 billion bottles are sold every year.

==The Perrier Awards==
From 1981 to 2005, the company sponsored an annual comedy award in the United Kingdom, the Perrier Comedy Award, also known as &quot;The Perriers&quot;. It was described as a means of supporting young comedic talent at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, an arts festival touted as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest&quot;. Initially for comedy reviews, by 1987 this included a standup comedian award. The award&#x27;s sponsorship was taken over by various other advertisers starting in 2006 with commensurate renaming, and it eventually came to be called the Edinburgh Comedy Awards.

The Perrier Young Jazz Awards were set up by Perrier in 1998, though never attained the success and recognition of their longer running comedy equivalent. The awards ran for four years, releasing an album showcasing its winners each year, before being discontinued. The last year the awards ceremony ran was 2001.

===Club career===
After playing junior football for Botany Methodists and Earlwood Wanderers Warren joined Canterbury-Marrickville as a fifteen-year-old in 1959. Initially he played in the club&#x27;s third grade team before being promoted to the first grade later in the year.

In 1963 Warren transferred to St George Budapest. In a 12-year stint at St George Warren won three NSW State League grand finals, one premiership and two state cups. His final action as a player was to score a match-winning goal for St George in the 1974 NSW State League Grand Final. Immediately after scoring the goal he substituted himself off.

===International career===
Warren made his full international debut for Australia in November 1965 against Cambodia in Phnom Penh. He played 42 international matches, including Australia&#x27;s first World Cup appearance in 1974.

In 1967 Warren captained the national team for the first time in a match against New Zealand in Saigon. He went on to captain Australia in 24 internationals.
=== International goals ===
==Coaching career==
In 1974 Warren was a player-coach with St George Budapest.

As well as helping found Canberra City, he served as the team&#x27;s first coach in 1977 and 1978.

==After retirement==

===Media===
Warren worked in television commentating football for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television networks. It was at SBS where he made his mark, appearing on a number of football analysis shows including On the Ball and The World Game.

Warren wept openly on national television in 1997 when two very late goals by Iran resulted in a 2–2 draw against the Socceroos in the final World Cup qualifying match and sent Iran to the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

===Gold Creek===
While in Canberra, John and his business partners acquired control of the Gold Creek Function and Entertainment Centre based around the historic Gold Creek Homestead (located in present-day Ngunnawal). The function centre was one of the National Capital&#x27;s premier function venues.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, numerous international visitors including members of Brazil&#x27;s Under 19s football team travelled to Gold Creek to get their first taste of Australian country life. Annual football camps were also held there under the auspices of the Australian Soccer Federation. Over a period of ten years, upwards of 10,000 teenagers from around the nation completed the two-week training camps.

===Opposition to the OFC===
Warren frequently argued for abolition of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), claiming that the OFC offered nothing to either the world game nor to the nations that comprised the confederation. The lack of competition for Australia in the OFC was exemplified by the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification results that featured 11–0, 22–0 and 31–0 scorelines against OFC opponents. The OFC does not have a direct qualification route to the World Cup. From 1986 to 2022, the OFC champion could only feature in an intercontinental play-off series against a team from either CONMEBOL, CONCACAF or the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to achieve a World Cup berth. Warren favoured a merger between the OFC and AFC that would allow the OFC nations to play in a regular qualification series. After the Crawford Report of which he was a committee member, Australia joined the AFC in 2006.

===Struggle for national success===
Warren&#x27;s publicly held belief was that if Australia&#x27;s strong sporting tradition was focused on the sport then Australia could be a world power in the game. One of his famous quotes on the matter was &quot;I&#x27;m sick of us saying, &#x27;When are we going to qualify for the World Cup&#x27;? When are we going to &quot;win&quot; the World Cup? ... Call me a dreamer.&quot; His comments came shortly after Australia had defeated England 3–1 in a friendly featuring a full-strength English side and two Confederations Cup wins over France and Brazil (the two finalist teams of the 1998 FIFA World Cup) when Australia took third place at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup in a 1–0 play-off win over Brazil.

Warren claimed that these results showed that Australia was a much more powerful football nation than many gave it credit for. At the time, Australia was reigning world champion in the other international codes – rugby union, rugby league and cricket, in addition to being an Olympic power and won four Formula One world titles between the 1950s and 1980s (with Jack Brabham and Alan Jones).

Nevertheless, Warren predicted that the Australian national team would attain consistent international success. He famously expressed a desire to say &#x27;I told you so&#x27; to the team&#x27;s detractors. The phrase has since become commonplace in the Australian soccer community, reflective of Warren&#x27;s overarching desire to see soccer become the most popular sport in Australia.

===&quot;Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters&quot;===
In 2002, Warren published a best selling book, &quot;Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters, An Incomplete Biography of Johnny Warren &amp; Soccer in Australia &quot; which traced the growth of soccer in Australia, especially in the post-World War II years. The title refers to alleged sexist, racist and homophobic attitudes towards soccer exhibited frequently by many Australians and especially the major city media in Australia through this period. The term &quot;sheila&quot; refers to a woman, &quot;wog&quot; is a derogatory term (but has since been appropriated by some) to refer to Australians of Mediterranean origin (specifically Southern Europe and the Levant), while &quot;poofter&quot; is a slur for a homosexual (generally a gay man).

==Personal life, illness and death==
In 1967 Warren married Marion Wilson. They divorced in 1969. He later married Maryana, originally from Uruguay. In 1997, his first wife Marion became a missing person. The case is the subject of the podcast &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;.

After smoking heavily for most of his life, in 2003 Warren publicly announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Several months later FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) president Sepp Blatter presented a frail Warren with the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit for his services to the game in Australia.

His last public appearance was made during the launch of the rebranded Australian domestic football league, the A-League, which replaced the previous National Soccer League.

Weeks before death, Warren was asked what he wanted his sporting legacy to be – his answer &quot;I Told You So&quot;, a phrase which has become a catch-cry in Australian football and during the 2006 FIFA World Cup appeared on the scoreboard in the backdrop of the SBS World Cup studio.

Warren died of respiratory complications related to his cancer on 6 November 2004, at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. He was awarded a full state funeral, the first to be held for a sportsman. Just over a year after his death, Australia qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 32 years, after defeating Uruguay in a penalty shootout. SBS analyst and former Socceroo Craig Foster was heard to shout &quot;Johnny Warren!&quot; on air in the immediate aftermath of Australia&#x27;s victory, and shortly before the end of the SBS broadcast, the journalist and his longtime colleague and friend Les Murray said &quot;They&#x27;ve done it, Johnny!&quot;.

He is survived by his only child Shannon Lee Warren (daughter of Donna Gilberston) and his four grandchildren Riley, Natasha, Tayla and Rhianna.

==Legacy==
The documentary &quot;Johnny Warren’s Football Mission&quot;, released in 2006, features interviews with his former teammates, family, friends and football journalists. In the documentary&quot;,&quot; Warren&#x27;s long-time colleague at SBS, Les Murray, wished that Johnny&#x27;s prophecy for Australian football would ring true. In the documentary, Murray professed that &quot;Johnny&#x27;s mission hasn&#x27;t been accomplished. It&#x27;s still going. I don&#x27;t believe it will be achieved until Australia wins the World Cup one day, and everyone appreciates football in the same way Johnny did.&quot; In one of his final public appearances, Warren was instilled into the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004, an accolate that Murray believed was &quot;the first time he [Warren] felt rewarded - truly rewarded - by football. He had always been acknowledged [...] letters from the queen, from heads of state, but never from football&quot;. At the ceremony, Warren used the opportunity to declare his love for Australian football and its future: &quot;I want Australia to embrace this fabulous game. It&#x27;s not wog-ball, this is the game of the world [...] we&#x27;ve got to stop talking about when we&#x27;re going to qualify, we need to start talking about when we&#x27;re going to win World Cups. If Japan, Korea and Turkey can do what they did, if Greece can do what they did at the Euro championships, then there&#x27;s a message there for Australia, that champion teams beat teams of champions&quot;. Warren publicly advocated for the National Soccer League (NSL) to be disbanded, recommending so in the 2003 Crawford Report. The NSL&#x27;s eventual demise laid bare the foundations for the new A-Leagues competitions, which feature no ethnic affiliations in any team to appeal to the mainstream Australian sporting landscape.

Johnny Warren&#x27;s untimely death in 2004 meant that he never witnessed the Socceroos qualify for a FIFA World Cup after doing so in 1973. When Australia ended a 31 year wait to qualify for a FIFA World Cup, defeating Uruguay on penalties, Les Murray paid homage to Warren&#x27;s legacy on the SBS broadcast. At the commencement of the post-match analysis, Murray joyously opened the segment, claiming that the match was &quot;one of the most epic games that I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to witness, and I&#x27;ve seen a few as you may be able to guess, and of course one in which we were all emotionally involved. And for Johnny Warren, I told you so, I told you so, and there it is, he has been proven to be right once again.&quot; Looking up to the sky, Murray profoundly said &quot;Johnny, we hear you&quot;. In later World Cup qualification cycles, Australian supporters have frequently displayed tifos that display Warren&#x27;s iconic &#x27;I told you so&#x27; message. In the second leg of Australia&#x27;s intercontinental play-off match against Honduras, the Green and Gold Army created a tifo honouring both Warren and Les Murray. When Australia qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup against Peru, supporters were seen in the stadium bearing &#x27;I told you so&#x27; banners in Warren&#x27;s honour. At the Matildas&#x27; games during the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, members of the Matildas Active Support group unfurled banners displaying &#x27;I told you so&#x27;, as well as &#x27;never say die&#x27;. In 2005, Johnny Warren&#x27;s family donated a collection of 503 items of memorabilia to the National Museum of Australia. The collection includes football uniforms, medals, scrapbooks and trophies. The National Museum paid tribute to Warren in 2010 with &#x27;I told you so&#x27;: Johnny Warren and football in Australia, a display to coincide with the World Cup.

The Jamberoo Pub, located on the NSW South Coast, is owned and run by members of the Warren family. The hotel bistro is well known for being a shrine dedicated to Johnny Warren, containing medals, photos, awards and other memorabilia about his life.

In 2022, the NSW Government reopened the Sydney Football Stadium after a four-year construction period. In an initiative to commemorate significant sporting figures in New South Wales, Johnny Warren was posthumously honoured with bay 23 of the stadium being named in his honour. Warren was included in the venue&#x27;s &#x27;Ring of Champions&#x27; along with Arthur Beetson, Ron Coote, Betty Cuthbert and Nicholas Shehadie. Warren was also recognised by the SCG Trust with a permanent statue outside the stadium in honour of his captaincy of the 1974 Socceroos and his advocacy for the development of association football in Australia.

<text>Sir John Grenfell Crawford (4 April 1910 – 28 October 1984) was an agricultural economist and a key architect of Australia&#x27;s post-war growth.

==Early life, education and family==
Born in Hurstville, Sydney, Crawford was the tenth of twelve children of Henry Crawford and Harriet Isabel Crawford, née Wood. Crawford was educated at Sydney Boys High School and the University of Sydney.

Crawford married Jessie Morgan on 18 May 1935 and together they had a daughter.

==Career==
In 1941 Crawford helped to create the Agricultural Economics Section of the New South Wales Government&#x27;s Department of Agriculture.

In 1942 he began working at the Department of War Organisation of Industry, before being appointed Director of Research at the Department of Post-War Reconstruction in 1943. In 1945 he was appointed inaugural Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, followed by Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture (later Department of Trade), and then Secretary of the Department of Trade, where he played an important role in forging new trade relationships with the United Kingdom and Japan.

He helped to establish the Australian Development Assistance Agency (now Australian Aid), the Industries Assistance Commission, and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. He was also an adviser to the World Bank, Washington D.C., and Director, Australian Japanese Economic Research Project.

Crawford was a founding member and inaugural chair of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, a statutory authority focusing on improving sustainable production in developing countries. He was also first chair of the Technical Advisory Committee to CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) from 1971 to 1976.

Crawford held several positions at the Australian National University: Director of the Research School of Pacific (and Asian) Studies (1960-1967); Vice-Chancellor (1968-1973); and then Chancellor (1976–1984).

==Recognition and awards==
Crawford was appointed a Commander of the Order of British Empire (CBE) in the 1954 New Years Honours List.

He was knighted in 1959 New Years Honours List.

In the 1978 Australia Day Honours List he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

He was the second president of the Australian Agricultural Economics Society, and in 1983 was made an honorary life member.

He was named Australian of the Year in 1981.

In 2009, a street in the Canberra suburb of Casey was named John Crawford Crescent in Crawford&#x27;s honour.

===Legacy at ANU===
The Crawford School of Public Policy is named after Crawford, and the school runs the annual Crawford Leadership Forum, opened by the J. G. Crawford Oration. It is also hosts the Sir John G Crawford Chair in Agricultural Economics.
The J.G. Crawford Prize was established by ANU in 1973, as Crawford was ending his term as vice-chancellor, in recognition of his contribution to the university. PhD Graduate students are nominated by college deans, and two (one for the natural sciences and one for social sciences/ humanities) and occasionally a third (for interdisciplinary work) are selected on the basis of academic excellence by a committee.

Since mid-2013 and , the ANU is undertaking a research project with the title &quot;J.G. Crawford: Shaping Australia&#x27;s Place in the World&quot;. Partnered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Crawford Fund, the project won an ARC Linkage Grant worth . A biography will be written by historian Nicholas Brown, while Frank Bongiorno is also involved in the project.

===Crawford Fund===
The Crawford Fund, a body established in Australia to support international agricultural research was also named in his honour. The fund awards the annual Sir John Crawford Fellowship to support scientists from developing countries, and since 1985 has hosted the Sir John Crawford Memorial Address. Notable speakers include Ross Garnaut, Frances Adamson, Catherine Bertini, Florence Chenoweth, Craig Venter, Shridath Ramphal and Robert McNamara.

<doc id="1144231" wikidata="Q5981978" url="?curid=1144231" title="Ian Kiernan">
<text>Ian Bruce Carrick Kiernan (4 October 1940 – 16 October 2018) was an Australian yachstman, property developer, builder, and environmental campaigner. He known for co-founding with Kim McKay the not-for-profit &quot;Clean Up Australia&quot; campaign in 1989, which developed into a global campaign in 1993. 

==Early life and education==
Ian Bruce Carrick Kiernan was born on 4 October 1940 in Sydney, New South Wales, to George Arthur and Leslie Katherine Kiernan. 

He was educated at The Scots College in Sydney, The Armidale School in northern New South Wales, and the Sydney Technical College, where he trained as a builder. 

==Career==
===Property===
Kiernan became a property developer, who owned a number of dwellings in the Sydney suburb of Redfern. He acquired around half of the housing in The Block in the early 1970s via his company Tierra del Fuego. After lobbying by local residents, the Whitlam government persuaded Kiernan and others to sell their properties to the government, leading to the establishment of the Aboriginal Housing Company, which managed The Block from then on. Kiernan&#x27;s construction company, IBK Construction Pty Ltd, sold the houses at a cost price and was tasked with redeveloping the site, promising to hire additional Aboriginal people to complete the work. Kiernan said that he would not be making a profit, and saw it as &quot;our contribution, and because we think people should get behind a responsible government which is doing something for the under-privileged&quot;.

===Boating===
Kiernan was also a yachtsman, sailing competitively for more than 40 years and representing Australia at the Admiral&#x27;s, Southern Cross, Dunhill, Clipper, Kenwood, and Trans-Pacific Cup competitions. 

In 1986/87 Kiernan represented Australia in the BOC Challenge solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished 6th out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 countries,&lt;ref name=&quot;boc-86/87&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; setting an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world.

===Clean Up===
During the BOC Challenge yacht race, Kiernan was appalled by the amount of rubbish choking the world&#x27;s oceans. The first &quot;Clean Up&quot; event, called &quot;Clean Up Lake Macquarie&quot;, was instigated in 1987 by Ivan Welsh as mayor of Lake Macquarie. In 1988, with Kim McKay, and the support of a committee of friends, Kiernan organised &quot;Clean Up Sydney Harbour&quot; on Sunday 8 January 1989. Around 40,000 volunteers turned out to help, and collected over 5000 tonnes. Clean Up Australia Day was first held in January 1990. The success of the 1989 event sparked national interest. 

The first &quot;Clean Up the World&quot; event took place in 1993. By 2007 some 35 million people from 80 nations turned out to clean up their part of the world and in 2017 it was estimated that 120 nations took part. By the time of Kiernan&#x27;s death in 2018, more than 21 million people had participated in annual Clean Up Australia Days, Friday Schools Clean Up Days, and Business Clean Ups in Australia. 

==Awards==
Kiernan&#x27;s environmental efforts were recognised in 1991 when the Australian Government awarded him the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM). He was awarded Australian of the Year in 1994. During the ceremony he assisted the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, in stopping a &quot;pseudo assassination&quot; attempt on Charles, Prince of Wales. 

In 1995, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).

In 1998, Kiernan was the recipient of the UNEP Sasakawa Prize. The prize is awarded every year to individuals with an established track record of achievement and the potential to make outstanding contributions to the protection and management of the environment consistent with UNEP&#x27;s policies and objectives. He received the World Citizenship Award from the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 1999.

In 2001, Kiernan was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service to the Clean Up Australia Campaign and the Clean up the World Campaign&quot;. 

In 2006 Kiernan received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Trust of Australia (NSW). 

The 2007 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; &quot;Most Trusted Poll&quot; voted Clean Up Australia as the country&#x27;s most trusted environmental charity and Kiernan as the fourth &quot;most trustworthy&quot; Australian. In 2008 in the same poll Kiernan was ranked number three.

Kiernan was also the recipient of the Toastmasters International Communications and Leadership Award, the Berger-Sullivan Tourism Award, the International Banksia Award, and the 1999 Building World Citizenship Award.

==Personal life and death==
In 2014, Kiernan pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in Sydney, following a previous charge for the same offence in 1998. This record was cited by the government of New South Wales when Kiernan was overlooked for the honour of having a Sydney ferry named after him.

He died on 16 October 2018 in Sydney at the age of 78. He is survived by his daughters Sally and Pip and son Jack.

<text>Simei ( ) is an estate located in Tampines Town in the Eastern Region of Singapore. The name &quot;Simei&quot; is pinyin for &quot;Four Beauties&quot; in Chinese. Formerly known as Tampines South, it was officially renamed to Simei in 1985.

==History and etymology==
The name &quot;Simei&quot; is the Pinyinized version of &quot;Soo Bee&quot;, after a short minor lane off Jalan Angin Laut, Jalan Soo Bee. It acquired its name during the height of a government policy of &quot;Pinyinization&quot;. The current MP serving the Changi-Simei constituency is Jessica Tan.

Simei used to be a Malay kampung. A large part of it was a Chinese cemetery called Hwa San Tng. It was cleared in February 1982 to make way for the HDB estate at Simei. For a brief period, the roads in the estate were named after the legendary Four Beauties (i.e. Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, Diaochan and Yang Guifei) in Chinese history. These confusing names were swiftly changed following complaints.

==Facilities==
Simei is a well-developed estate with plenty of amenities and facilities. There are schools, an MRT station, coffee shops and a shopping mall, Eastpoint Mall. While outside of Simei there is also Singapore Expo, Changi Business Park and Changi City Point nearby. Commercial tenants of the shopping centres include restaurants, supermarkets, department stores, bookstores, jewellery and gift shops.

Simei Park is the only park in Simei, consisting of a playground, elderly fitness corner and running tracks. There are different kinds of residential dwellings in the area, comprising landed properties, condominiums, mansions and public housing flats. For medical needs, Changi General Hospital is located here as well, and serves many Singaporeans living in the eastern area.

==Amenities==

There are wide range of amenities at Simei, including Changi General Hospital, retail outlets and the Changi Simei community centre.

Education facilities situated in the town include ITE College East, the Metta Development School, Changkat Primary School, Changkat Changi Secondary School, as well as the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Being in between Bedok and Tampines, residents are within reach of even more amenities.

==Transport==

Simei is well served by public transport. Most of the town is within 10 minutes walking distance from Simei MRT station. It also enjoys close proximity to Singapore Changi Airport via the Pan Island Expressway. Public bus services that serve Simei&#x27;s town centre, the MRT station and the outskirts include 2, 5, 9, 10, 12, Express 12e, 17, 20, 24, 31, 35, 35M, 38, 47, 48, 118, 531, 753 and TS1.

<text>Rock Against Howard, Musicians Against the Liberal Government is an Australian compilation CD featuring anti-Coalition musicians, released in 2004. The project hoped to inspire young voters to turn out in federal elections that year to vote against then-Prime Minister John Howard. Howard&#x27;s party prevailed in 2004 but was ousted in 2007 with Howard losing his own seat.

&quot;Rock Against Howard&quot; was organised by Frenzal Rhomb guitarist Lindsay McDougall, when he realised every musician he knew felt the same way about Howard. McDougall told Daniel Johnson of &quot;The Age&quot; that &quot;I wanted to get more and different music fans and acts in on the idea of &quot;Rock Against Howard&quot;, and it also adequately reflects my taste in music, because I&#x27;ve got a bunch of my favourite bands on here as well.&quot; The project was inspired by the American &quot;Rock Against Bush&quot; compilations, and takes on a similar format. All profits from album sales go to refugee charities through the Refugee Action Coalition, an ironic tribute to Howard&#x27;s stance on asylum seekers.

The music on the release is politically oriented, with the first disk featuring previously released songs, and a disk of live and otherwise previously unreleased work on the second. The style of music varies widely, with punk rock, hip-hop, and even show tunes.
