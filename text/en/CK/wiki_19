<text>The 1980 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 31 August 1980 at the Circuit Zandvoort in the Netherlands. It was the eleventh race of the 1980 Formula One season. 

== Report ==
The race was the 29th Dutch Grand Prix. The race was held over 72 laps of the 4.252-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 306 kilometres.

The race was won by Brazilian driver, Nelson Piquet driving a Brabham BT49. The win was Piquet&#x27;s second Formula One Grand Prix victory having taken his first win earlier the same year at the 1980 United States Grand Prix West. The win confirmed Piquet as being the major threat to Alan Jones&#x27; charge to the world championship crown. Piquet won by twelve seconds over French driver René Arnoux driving a Renault RE20. Less than half a second behind in third was another French driver Jacques Laffite (Ligier JS11/15).

The circuit had been altered for the second time in as many years with the back straight chicane tightened significantly. There were several new combinations. Alfa Romeo entered a second car, a replacement after Patrick Depailler&#x27;s death a month earlier, for Italian veteran Vittorio Brambilla. Geoff Lees was entered in a second Ensign N180 and Jochen Mass returned from injury in an Arrows A3. Mass&#x27; return proved to be premature and he pulled out of the meeting. Tyrrell Racing test driver Mike Thackwell stepped into the car but failed in his attempt to be the youngest ever Formula One race starter.

Jones won the start from the second row of the grid to lead early until he pitted with damaged skirts. Laffite soon took the lead from Arnoux before both were picked-off by Piquet. Late in the race Arnoux regained second place. Behind Laffite, the second Williams FW07B of Carlos Reutemann finished fourth ahead of Jean-Pierre Jarier (driving his 100th Grand Prix) in the surviving Tyrrell 010 after Derek Daly had crashed earlier after brake failure. Young rookie Alain Prost claimed the final point debuting the new McLaren M30, while in seventh Gilles Villeneuve had given one of Ferrari&#x27;s few 1980 highlights, running as high as third before his tyres went off.

Jones was three laps down in eleventh, his championship now in real danger as Piquet had closed to within two points. Reutemann now led the battle for third by a point over Laffite and three over Arnoux. Williams now had one hand firmly on the constructors&#x27; trophy, leading Ligier by 25 points and Brabham by 35 with Piquet&#x27;s teammates providing virtually no support to the constructor&#x27;s tally.

<text>The 1980 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 14 September 1980 at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy. It was the twelfth race of the 1980 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1980 International Cup for F1 Constructors.

This was the first Formula One World Championship race to be held at Imola (the circuit having hosted the non-championship Dino Ferrari Grand Prix the previous year). It was the only Italian Grand Prix since 1948 not to be held at Monza, which was undergoing refurbishment at the time. The event would return to Monza in 1981, but Imola would remain on the F1 calendar until 2006, hosting the San Marino Grand Prix, and since 2020, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix.

The race was held over 60 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of .

The race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-Ford. Piquet won by nearly half a minute from Australian driver Alan Jones, driving a Williams-Ford, with Jones&#x27; Argentine team-mate Carlos Reutemann third. The win was Piquet&#x27;s third of the season and second in succession, and it gave him the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by one point from Jones.

Manfred Winkelhock made his debut, substituting for the injured Jochen Mass at Arrows. A collision with Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Lotus during qualifying resulted in both drivers failing to make the grid. Ferrari debuted their first turbo car, the 126C, but Gilles Villeneuve started the race in his regular 312T5. Regardless, after a heavy crash in practice at the flat-out right hander before Tosa, reigning World Champion Jody Scheckter announced his retirement from the sport.

The front row of the grid was occupied by the Renaults of René Arnoux and Jean-Pierre Jabouille, although Piquet led by lap 4 and was never headed. On lap 6, Villeneuve crashed his Ferrari heavily at the corner which now bears his name, following a puncture. Villeneuve escaped unhurt, but the incident also caused the retirement of Bruno Giacomelli, who ran over some of the debris in his Alfa Romeo. Jones moved up to second on lap 29 after running as low as seventh. Behind Reutemann, Elio de Angelis finished fourth in his Lotus, with Keke Rosberg fifth in his Fittipaldi and Didier Pironi sixth in his Ligier.

Jones&#x27; and Reutemann&#x27;s podium finishes enabled the Williams team to secure their first Constructors&#x27; Championship with two races remaining.

<text>The 1980 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 28 September 1980, at the Circuit Île Notre-Dame in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the thirteenth and penultimate race of the 1980 Formula One season. The race was the 19th Canadian Grand Prix and the third to be held in Montreal. The race was held over 70 laps of the 4.41-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 309 kilometres.

Australian driver Alan Jones, driving a Williams FW07B, won his second consecutive Canadian Grand Prix, and coupled with the retirement of the Brabham BT49 of Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet due to the failure of its Cosworth DFV engine, this allowed Jones to secure the 1980 World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Jones became only the second Australian to claim the world championship, a title last won by Jack Brabham in 1966. It was also the first World Drivers&#x27; Championship for Williams Grand Prix Engineering, adding to their first Constructors&#x27; Championship, achieved two weeks earlier at the Italian Grand Prix. The race featured a controversial first start where Piquet and Jones raced side by side to the first corner and touched, causing Piquet to hit the wall, sparking off other accidents behind. Piquet was forced to restart in his more fragile qualifying car, which ultimately led to his retirement and the end of the title battle. Some commentators thought Jones had forced Piquet into the wall, but the Brazilian shrugged it off as a racing incident. 

The brief comeback of Vittorio Brambilla had come to an end with the Italian veteran retiring from Formula One. Alfa Romeo replaced him with someone younger and Andrea de Cesaris made his Grand Prix debut, as did teenage New Zealander Mike Thackwell. Thackwell stepped aboard a third Tyrrell 010 breaking the record as the youngest ever driver to start a Grand Prix, a record held for 19 years by the late Mexican teenager Ricardo Rodríguez. The record would stand for 29 years until broken by Jaime Alguersuari in 2009.

First and second in the championship were decided with the 1980 United States Grand Prix still to come. Jones led Piquet by 8 points but Piquet had already had five points-scoring finishes in the second half of the season. If Piquet won at Watkins Glen he would have to drop the two points from his fifth-place finish in Austria, leaving him one point behind Jones even if Jones failed to finish. Third place in the championship was theoretically open with Laffite eight points behind Reutemann. Second place in the constructors&#x27; championship was still open with Brabham just five points behind Ligier.

Piquet qualified on pole from Jones but used a car in fragile qualifying specification to do it. At the start Jones outlaunched Piquet but the pair refused to compromise at the first turn and the two touched, triggering a multi-car pile-up. The collision involved Jean-Pierre Jarier (Tyrrell 010), Derek Daly (Tyrrell 010), Emerson Fittipaldi (Fittipaldi F8), Keke Rosberg (Fittipaldi F8), Mario Andretti (Lotus 81), Gilles Villeneuve (Ferrari 312T5) and Jochen Mass (Arrows A3). Piquet, Fittipaldi, Villeneuve, Andretti and Mass restarted in spare cars, in Piquet&#x27;s case his fragile qualifying car and Rosberg had his car repaired. Daly was out as was Thackwell as Jarier commandeered his Tyrrell 010. At the restart Jones led before a storming Piquet took the lead until his qualifying specification Cosworth DFV inevitably failed. Two laps later and Jean-Pierre Jabouille crashed his Renault RE20 heavily, seriously injuring his legs. Jabouille had to be cut from the car.

Jones took up the lead again until Pironi forced his way into a lead which was clouded over a jumped start for which he was eventually assigned a 60-second penalty. Pironi took the chequer but would be classified third behind Jones and Reutemann. Alain Prost could have been third or even second until a suspension failure saw his McLaren M30 crash. Watson was ahead of Reutemann as well when he spun and finished fourth in his McLaren. Local hero Villeneuve claimed fifth for Ferrari on a dismal weekend that saw outgoing World Champion Jody Scheckter fail to qualify his Ferrari 312T5. The final point was claimed by Héctor Rebaque in his Brabham BT49 as Jacques Laffite ran out of fuel in his Ligier JS11/15 in the closing stages.

== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for New Zealand driver Mike Thackwell, Italian driver Andrea de Cesaris and American driver Kevin Cogan.
* This was the 10th Grand Prix win for Williams.

<text>The 1981 Brazilian Grand Prix was the second race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship and was held on 29 March 1981 at Jacarepaguá in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Formula One moved to the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro from the Interlagos circuit in São Paulo, after safety concerns with the long Interlagos circuit and the growing slums of São Paulo being at odds with the glamorous image of Formula One.

The Argentine driver Carlos Reutemann won the race in contentious circumstances; he ignored his pit signals to give up the lead to his teammate and team leader Alan Jones. Jones, who finished second, did not show up on the podium afterwards.

<text>The 1981 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 3 May 1981. It was the fourth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship. 

The race was the first to bear the title &quot;San Marino Grand Prix&quot;, although the Imola circuit is in Italy and several non-championship Formula One races and the 1980 Italian Grand Prix had previously been held at the circuit. The Acque-Minerali chicane had been widened from the year before and was faster; the chicane in its original narrow configuration in 1980 was unpopular with drivers because it was very slow.

The Lotus team withdrew their entries because the FIA upheld the ban on the Lotus 88 and team owner Colin Chapman felt the 81s were no longer competitive.

Gilles Villeneuve took the early lead until an ill-fated pit stop for slick tyres, whereafter Didier Pironi held the lead until late in the race and was passed by Nelson Piquet, who eventually won the race. As well as being Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Grand Prix debut, the race is also notable for the recovery of Gilles Villeneuve to seventh place, after misjudgement of tyre selection for the conditions. While the team did not qualify for the race, it was the first race entered by Toleman, which is now Alpine F1 Team.

<text>The 1981 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zolder on 17 May 1981. It was the fifth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship. It was the last of 12 victories for Carlos Reutemann and the last win for an Argentine driver . It was also the first of 59 podiums for 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell.

==Mechanic safety and chaotic first race==
The race was marred by two serious incidents involving mechanics, one fatal. In Friday practice a mechanic from the Osella team, Giovanni Amadeo, stumbled off the pitwall into the path of the Williams of Carlos Reutemann. Reutemann was unable to avoid the mechanic, who suffered a fractured skull. He died from his injuries on the Monday after the race. Before the start of the race the mechanics of all the teams staged a protest over the safety measures protecting them, which was soon joined by several drivers (Villeneuve, Prost, Laffite, Pironi and Scheckter) who left their cars. According to World Champion James Hunt who was commentating live for BBC in &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot;, the protest was largely over the narrow pits at Zolder and that the pits were overcrowded, especially with people who were nothing more than &#x27;hangers on&#x27; who were there to be seen and not for the actual racing.

The race organisers nevertheless flagged the warm-up lap at the normal time, leaving several cars delayed on the grid, either stalled or with their cockpits vacant. The resulting chaos when the grid formed up again at the end of this lap was exacerbated when Nelson Piquet missed his starting position and was sent round on another lap, with the other cars being held in position. As the cars began to overheat, several drivers turned off their engines, among them Arrows driver Riccardo Patrese, expecting another formation lap due to Piquet&#x27;s error. However, the organisers began the start sequence as usual once Piquet had regained his position. Patrese was unable to restart his car and waved his arms to signal that he could not take the start. His mechanic, Dave Luckett, came onto the track to restart the car from behind. As he did so, the Clerk of the Course had already started the lighting sequence to start the race, and the race went ahead despite his presence and Patrese&#x27;s gesticulations. The other Arrows driver, Siegfried Stohr, ploughed into the back of his teammate&#x27;s car, hitting Luckett. Luckett suffered a broken leg and lacerations but survived the incident. The race continued, and as the field was about to start the second lap, Stohr&#x27;s disabled car was still on the circuit, and some of the furious marshals, who did not have the official authority to stop the race jumped onto the track and frantically waved at the drivers to stop while the cars passed by with very little space on the narrow track. The confused drivers waved back at the marshals, and on the next lap the drivers did stop at their own accord.

As a result of these events, a new rule was introduced forbidding mechanics from being on the grid within fifteen seconds of the formation lap, and the race starter would use greater caution.

==Race report==
In the race, Reutemann was passed by Didier Pironi going into the first corner. Then Alan Jones nudged off Nelson Piquet at the early stages of the race and Piquet crashed into some catch fencing at the chicane. A few laps later, Jones&#x27;s gearbox failed, and he ploughed into the barriers and badly burned his left thigh after the gearbox oil leaked into his cockpit. Following Jones&#x27;s retirement, Piquet, still furious after their previous incident, stormed to the Williams garage and had an altercation with Jones and the Williams personnel. Pironi had fallen back and after Jones&#x27;s accident, Reutemann took the lead, keeping it until the race was called off early because of rain starting to fall on the track. It was his second victory of the season and the 12th and ultimately final victory of his career.

<text>The 1981 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 31 May 1981. It was the sixth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

The 76-lap race was won by Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve, driving a Ferrari. Brazilian Nelson Piquet took pole position in his Brabham-Ford and led until he crashed out on lap 54. Australian Alan Jones finished second in a Williams-Ford, with Frenchman Jacques Laffite third in a Ligier-Matra.

==Race==
The start of the race was delayed after a fire in the Loews Hotel kitchens, which necessitated the fire service pumping large quantities of water to put the fires out. Water then seeped through the floors of the hotel and into the tunnel, delaying the race for an hour. Nelson Piquet led for much of the race, but crashed out late on. New race leader Alan Jones then suffered a fuel feed problem in the latter stages of the race, allowing Gilles Villeneuve in his Ferrari, to take his first victory since 1979 as well as becoming the first, and to this day, the only Canadian to win in Monaco. Championship leader Carlos Reutemann retired with gearbox problems, breaking a 15-race streak of consistently finishing in the points.

<text>The 1981 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 21 June 1981 at the Circuito Permanente del Jarama, Jarama, Spain. It was the seventh race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

==Summary==
The 1981 Spanish Grand Prix featured the second closest finish ever of a Formula One race: after Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari, the four following cars finished in just 1.24 seconds. This was Villeneuve&#x27;s last victory, often regarded as his tactical masterpiece.

There were some changes for this race: Eliseo Salazar had left March to join Ensign, replacing Marc Surer. Also, John Player Special sponsorship and livery returned to Team Lotus after a 2-year hiatus.

The pole went to Jacques Laffite on his Ligier-Matra with the two Williams-Cosworth of Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann second and third ahead of John Watson&#x27;s McLaren, Alain Prost&#x27;s Renault and the Alfa Romeo of Bruno Giacomelli. Gilles Villeneuve was seventh.

Race day was unusually hot. At the beginning of the race Jones and Reutemann went into the lead, as Laffite made a poor start. Villeneuve jumped into third place at the first corner, damaging Prost&#x27;s front wing as he took the position. At the end of the first lap Villeneuve pulled out of Reutemann&#x27;s slipstream and took second place. Jones began to build a lead but on lap 14 he went off the track, when he was 10 seconds ahead of the Canadian.

This left Villeneuve with Reutemann on his tail. Behind them Watson, Laffite and Elio de Angelis began to close on the dueling leaders. Reutemann was having some trouble with his gearbox and when Laffite arrived behind him there was little the Argentine could do to stop him from overtaking. Reutemann would later drop behind Watson. The five front-runners became a train of cars, packed together for the remaining laps of the race.

Villeneuve used the power of his Ferrari engine on the straight to gain a little margin and not get overtaken by his rivals, but in the corners they were all over him. Many times Laffite pulled alongside the Canadian as they went out a corner but the Ferrari would stay ahead as the horsepower kicked in. The five remained locked together right to the flag, crossing the line covered by just 1.24 seconds to record the second-closest race in the history of Formula One.

This would be the last Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama, owing to criticism of the track being too narrow for modern Formula One, the unpleasant conditions and the small crowd (the small turn-out was probably due to the backlash of the previous year&#x27;s race not being counted as a World Championship race, the announcement was made on the weekend itself); and the last Spanish Grand Prix until the season, when it would be held at the newly built Jerez circuit in the south of the country. At this Grand Prix the Equipe Banco Occidental team became the last privateer team to have entered a car for a race alongside a works team when they entered a Williams car alongside the Williams works team, but eventually withdrew before the practice and qualifying.

<text>The 1981 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Dijon-Prenois near Dijon, France on 5 July 1981. It was the eighth race of the 1981 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 80-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a Renault. On home soil, Prost scored the first of an eventual 51 Grand Prix victories, in a race that was stopped after 58 laps due to heavy rain and then restarted, with aggregate times determining the final positions. John Watson finished second in his McLaren-Ford, while Nelson Piquet, who had been leading in his Brabham-Ford when the race was stopped, finished third.

Prior to the race, Jean-Pierre Jabouille decided to retire from Formula One, having not fully recovered from the leg injuries he had sustained in Canada the previous year. His place at Ligier was taken for the rest of the season by Patrick Tambay, who moved from Theodore.

<text>The 1981 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 2 August 1981. It was the tenth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-Ford. Frenchman Alain Prost finished second in a Renault, having started from pole position, with compatriot Jacques Laffite third in a Ligier-Matra. The win, Piquet&#x27;s third of the season, allowed him to move to within eight points of Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Argentine Carlos Reutemann, who retired with an engine failure.

==Qualifying report==
The pit entrance had been modified and slowed down; the drivers now entered the pits earlier than before. The two Renault turbo cars were on the front row with Alain Prost almost half a second quicker than teammate René Arnoux. It was the first pole position of Prost&#x27;s F1 career. Williams locked out the second row with World Championship leader Carlos Reutemann third and teammate Alan Jones fourth. Didier Pironi was fifth in his Ferrari and Nelson Piquet was sixth in his Brabham. The top 10 was completed by Jacques Laffite (Ligier), Gilles Villeneuve (Ferrari) and the two McLarens of John Watson and Andrea de Cesaris.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
The two Williams on the second row enjoyed a better start than the Renaults of Prost and Arnoux. Arnoux was overtaken both by Reutemann and Pironi before the first corner, and by Piquet tried a move in the Ostkurve but the two cars collided, deflating Arnoux&#x27;s right rear tire and causing him to pit at the end of the lap. Piquet lost a place to Jones in the process, whilst Arnoux dropped through the field. On the second lap, Pironi&#x27;s engine failed, making him retire from fourth. Consequently, Prost led from Reutemann, Jones, Piquet and Laffite, and the top five pulled away from the rest of the pack, led by Villeneuve in sixth. Reutemann was quickly overtaken by both Jones and Piquet, beginning a three-way fight from the lead until Piquet&#x27;s tires fell off the pace and he dropped to fourth behind Reutemann.

On lap 21, the lead changed when Prost was overtaken by Jones as the duo were lapping Arnoux. Reutemann retired from the race on lap 28 with an engine failure. After around 30 laps, rain started to fall on the circuit and the Renaults suffered from poor handling and third place Piquet quickly overtook Prost for second. Jones&#x27; lead was diminished when his engine began to misfire, eventually dropping behind Piquet and Prost before heading to the pits, and he eventually finished a lap behind.

Piquet held on to his lead and finished first, in front of Prost, Laffite and Héctor Rebaque. Eddie Cheever finished fifth to round up the top five, in front of John Watson in sixth.

===Race classification===
==Notes==

* This was the 10th Grand Prix start for Hongkongese constructor Theodore.
* This was the 11th German Grand Prix win for a Ford-powered car. It broke the previous record set by Ferrari at the 1977 German Grand Prix.

<text>The 1981 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 16 August 1981. It was the eleventh race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Frenchman Jacques Laffite, driving a Talbot Ligier-Matra. Compatriot René Arnoux finished second in a Renault, having started from pole position, with Brazilian Nelson Piquet third in a Brabham-Ford. Piquet moved to within six points of Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Argentine Carlos Reutemann, who finished fifth in his Williams-Ford.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
In qualifying, just like the previous year, it was an all-French front row; René Arnoux planted his turbocharged Renault on pole, alongside his teammate Alain Prost. Next was Gilles Villeneuve in his turbocharged Ferrari, Jacques Laffite in the Talbot Ligier, Carlos Reutemann and Alan Jones in the Williams cars were 5th and 6th, then Nelson Piquet in a Brabham and then Didier Pironi in the other turbocharged Ferrari.

The Fittipaldi team was not present because they did not have enough engines.

===Race===
At the start, Villeneuve got the jump on the two Renaults and led into the Hella-Licht chicane. On the next lap, Prost passed Villeneuve into the Hella-Licht; Villeneuve tried to outbrake Prost but he locked up solid and went into some runoff area; as did Reutemann. Both the Canadian and Argentine drivers were able to rejoin, but with time lost.

At the high-speed Österreichring, a power advantage paid dividends. Prost and Arnoux were able to pull away from the rest of the field. Around lap 4, Pironi (who had made a lightning start from 8th on the grid) was running 3rd, and Laffite, Piquet, Jones and eventually Reutemann had caught up to Pironi. None of them could find a way past, and were held up by Pironi for a number of laps. In a similar situation to the Spanish Grand Prix earlier in the year, the Ferrari had more power than any of the cars behind it did, but its handling was way worse; so they were able to stay with the Ferrari. The 5 drivers battled it out, with Piquet, Laffite, Jones and Reutemann keeping with and desperately trying to find a way past Pironi, but not being able to because of the Ferrari&#x27;s power pulling away on the straights; made more difficult by the fact that the scenic Österreichring was made up almost entirely of long corners and straights.

Villeneuve crashed heavily at the Bosch-Kurve on lap 12, and finally, Laffite, having already passed Piquet, managed to outbrake Pironi into the first of the Texaco bends, and then the rest of the three drivers got by as well. Prost retired from the lead with damaged suspension, and Laffite then charged after Arnoux, passing him at the second of the 2 Texaco Bends. Laffite was to hold the lead until the end, and the poor performance of the Ferrari in relation to other cars meant that Pironi managed to hold up more cars.

Laffite crossed the line, followed by Arnoux, Piquet, Jones, Reutemann (who coasted over the finish line with a dead engine) and John Watson in the carbon-fibre McLaren.

<text>The 1981 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on 30 August 1981. It was the twelfth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

The 72-lap race was won from pole position by Alain Prost, driving a Renault. Nelson Piquet finished second in a Brabham-Ford, with Alan Jones third in a Williams-Ford. With Carlos Reutemann failing to finish in the other Williams-Ford after colliding with Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier-Matra, Piquet moved into the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with the same number of points as Reutemann but more wins.

== Qualifying report ==

The Fittipaldi team returned after missing the previous race in Austria due to a lack of engines. However both their drivers, Keke Rosberg and Chico Serra, failed to qualify.

For the fourth consecutive race, the Renaults filled the front row, with Alain Prost 0.079 seconds ahead of René Arnoux. Nelson Piquet was third in his Brabham, followed by the two Williams of Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann and the Ligier of Jacques Laffite. The top ten was completed by Mario Andretti in the Alfa Romeo, John Watson in the McLaren, Elio de Angelis in the Lotus and Riccardo Patrese in the Arrows.

=== Qualifying classification ===
== Race report ==

At the start, Prost led the field into Tarzan, with teammate Arnoux following closely behind. Further back in the midfield, Gilles Villeneuve crashed his Ferrari into the back of Bruno Giacomelli&#x27;s Alfa Romeo, vaulting over the Alfa before spinning out of the race.

As the field wound toward the second corner, Andretti and Reutemann collided, leaving Andretti&#x27;s car with a broken nose. Before the end of the first lap, another incident occurred when Patrick Tambay in the second Ligier and Didier Pironi in the second Ferrari came together. Tambay retired instantly, whilst Pironi carried on for three more laps before also pulling out of the race.

At the front of the field, Arnoux was unable to keep up with the pace and dropped four places, behind Jones, Piquet, Laffite and Reutemann. With Arnoux out of the way, Jones hunted down Prost and challenged for the lead until his tyres wore out and Jones had to slow down. Reutemann and Laffite, in the meantime, battled fiercely for fourth, ending with both cars crashing out of the race on the 18th lap.

Toward the end of the race, a slowing Jones was overtaken by Piquet. This would prove to be crucial in the World Championship standings, for if Jones had kept second, Piquet would have missed out on the title at the final race of the season.

<doc id="1122808" wikidata="Q76508" url="?curid=1122808" title="Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy">
<text>Emmanuel Philibert (; ; 8 July 1528 – 30 August 1580), known as (; &quot;Ironhead&quot;, because of his military career), was Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 17 August 1553 until his death in 1580. He is remembered for the recovery of the Savoyard state (invaded and occupied by France when he was a child) following the Battle of St. Quentin (1557), and for moving its capital to Turin.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Born in Chambéry, Emmanuel Philibert was the only child of Charles III, Duke of Savoy, and Beatrice of Portugal to reach adulthood. His mother was sister-in-law to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the future duke served in Charles&#x27;s army during the war against Francis I of France, distinguishing himself by capturing Hesdin in July 1553. 

=== Reign ===
A month later, his father died, and he became Duke of Savoy on the death of his father, but this was a nearly empty honour, as the vast majority of his hereditary lands had been occupied and administered by the French since 1536. Instead, he continued to serve the Habsburgs in hopes of recovering his lands, and served his cousin Philip II of Spain as Governor of the Netherlands from 1555 to 1559.

In this capacity, he personally led the Spanish invasion of northern France and won a brilliant victory at Saint-Quentin on 10 August 1557. He was also a suitor to Lady Elizabeth Tudor (the future queen Elizabeth I), daughter of Henry VIII of England. Emmanuel Philibert finally recovered his lands following the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis signed between France and Spain in 1559, and he married his first cousin once removed, Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry, the sister of King Henry II of France. Their only child was Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy.

==== Portuguese War of Succession ====
After the death of his uncle, Henry I of Portugal, on 31 January 1580, Emmanuel Philibert fought to impose his rights as a claimant to the Portuguese throne. However, he soon realized that he had quite a fragile position due to the claims of Philip II, who gained control of the country, thus uniting Spain and Portugal.

=== Later Reign ===
Emmanuel Philibert spent his rule regaining what had been lost in the costly wars with France. A skilled political strategist, he took advantage of various squabbles in Europe to slowly regain territory from both the French and the Spanish, including the city of Turin. He also purchased two territories. Internally, he moved his political capital from Chambéry to Turin and replaced Latin as the official language with French in the Duchy of Savoy and the Duchy of Aosta and with Italian in the Principality of Piedmont and the County of Nice. He was attempting to acquire the marquisate of Saluzzo when he died in Turin. Later, he was buried in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud of the Turin Cathedral, to which he had moved the Sindone in 1578.

<text>The 1981 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 13 September 1981. It was the thirteenth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

Formula One returned to Monza after the previous year&#x27;s Italian Grand Prix had been held at Imola. The 52-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, who led every lap in his Renault after starting from third position. Australian Alan Jones finished second in a Williams-Ford, some 22 seconds behind, with Argentine teammate Carlos Reutemann third.

Reutemann came into the race tied on points at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship with Brazilian Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-Ford. Piquet suffered a last-lap engine failure which dropped him from third to sixth, giving Reutemann a three-point lead in the championship with two races remaining.

== Qualifying report ==
Qualifying saw René Arnoux take pole position in his Renault by 0.67 seconds from Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Williams. It was Arnoux&#x27;s fourth pole position of the season and the sixth in succession for the Renault team. Alain Prost was third in the other Renault, with Jacques Laffite in the Ligier alongside him on the second row of the grid. Alan Jones in the other Williams and Nelson Piquet in the Brabham made up the third row, and the top ten was completed by John Watson in the McLaren, Didier Pironi and Gilles Villeneuve in the two Ferraris, and Bruno Giacomelli in the Alfa Romeo.

For the first time, the Toleman team qualified for a race, with Brian Henton taking 23rd. Teammate Derek Warwick failed to qualify along with Marc Surer in the Theodore, Beppe Gabbiani in the Osella, Siegfried Stohr in the Arrows, and Keke Rosberg and Chico Serra in the two Fittipaldis. Stohr crashed heavily during the qualifying session; already haunted by the trauma of nearly killing mechanic Dave Luckett in Belgium earlier in the season, he ultimately decided to stop racing and start a successful motor racing academy.

=== Qualifying classification ===
== Race report ==
On the run-up to the first chicane, Prost passed both Reutemann and teammate Arnoux to take the lead, while Pironi jumped from eighth to fourth. Reutemann then overtook Arnoux at the Curva Grande, before Pironi overtook both to run second by the end of the lap. As Prost opened up a lead, Arnoux re-passed Reutemann on lap 2 and Pironi on lap 5. Laffite, having already passed Reutemann, then overtook Pironi for third on lap 6, as Villeneuve retired with an engine failure.

On lap 12, Laffite dropped out with a puncture, by which point Pironi had dropped back behind Reutemann and Jones. As rain started to fall, Jones passed teammate Reutemann for third. At the end of the lap, Eddie Cheever spun his Tyrrell out at the Parabolica; on the next lap, Arnoux himself spun out after swerving to avoid Cheever&#x27;s abandoned car, leaving Prost comfortably clear of Jones. Reutemann, struggling as the track started to dry again, soon fell to eighth behind Giacomelli, Patrick Tambay in the second Ligier (who had only started 15th), Piquet, Pironi and Watson.

On lap 20, Watson lost control exiting the second Lesmo bend and smashed into the barriers at high speed. The McLaren was torn in two, with the gearbox and rear wheels going across the track and clipping the second Tyrrell of Michele Alboreto, who also retired. Watson escaped unharmed.

On lap 23 Tambay, like teammate Laffite, retired with a puncture, before Giacomelli pulled into the pits with a jammed gearbox on lap 26. Piquet was thus promoted to third with Pironi fourth and Reutemann fifth, followed by Mario Andretti in the second Alfa Romeo, Elio de Angelis in the Lotus and Andrea de Cesaris in the second McLaren. Reutemann soon passed Pironi again, before Andretti suffered an engine failure on lap 41.

As Prost cruised to victory, ultimately finishing some 22 seconds ahead of Jones, Piquet looked set to hold off championship rival Reutemann for third, until his engine blew on the last lap. Reutemann duly went past, as did de Angelis and Pironi. Piquet was classified sixth ahead of de Cesaris, who himself suffered a puncture on the last lap. The only other finishers were Giacomelli, Jean-Pierre Jarier in the second Osella, and Henton.

Reutemann thus led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by three points from Piquet with two races remaining, with Prost, Jones and Laffite all retaining outside chances of the title. The Williams team, meanwhile, needed just two more points to secure their second consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Race classification ===
==Notes==

* This was the 1st Grand Prix start for Toleman and for a Hart-powered car.
* This was the 44th podium finish for Carlos Reutemann. It broke the previous record set by Jackie Stewart at the 1973 Austrian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1981 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Île Notre-Dame, Montreal on 27 September 1981. It was the fourteenth race of the 1981 Formula One World Championship.

The race was run in wet conditions, and ended after 63 of the scheduled 70 laps due to the two-hour time limit. Frenchman Jacques Laffite won in a Talbot Ligier-Matra, with Northern Ireland&#x27;s John Watson second in a McLaren-Ford and local hero Gilles Villeneuve third in a Ferrari. Brazilian Nelson Piquet finished fifth in his Brabham-Ford, having started from pole position, while Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Argentine Carlos Reutemann, could only manage tenth in his Williams-Ford. Piquet thus moved within one point of Reutemann with one race to go, while the win gave Laffite an outside chance of the title. Despite both Reutemann and Australian teammate Alan Jones failing to score, Williams clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

This would turn out to be Laffite&#x27;s final F1 victory, as well as the last for the Ligier team for fifteen years, until the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix. It was also the last time the Canadian Grand Prix was held in the fall, as the race would move to June the following year.

== Pre-race ==
Prior to the race, Alan Jones announced that he was retiring from the sport after clinching the title the previous year. Rumors were also spreading around in paddock that Niki Lauda had tested for McLaren at Donington Park and that he was planning a comeback.

== Qualifying ==
Nelson Piquet clinched pole with a time of 1:29.221, with rival Carlos Reutemann alongside him on the front row. The top ten were completed by: Jones, Prost, Mansell, Rebaque, de Angelis, Arnoux, Watson and Laffite respectively.

==Race==
The race start was marred with bad weather. Immediately after the start, Jones took the lead after a minor collision with Reutemann which left Reutemann behind. Toward the middle of the pack, Arnoux and Pironi had a collision which resulted in Arnoux spinning out of the race. On lap 7, Jones spun and Piquet had to take evasive action, resulting in both drivers dropping down the pecking order. Prost took the lead with Laffite, who had climbed from tenth, second. Prost&#x27;s lead did not last long, as Laffite overtook him on lap 13, and kept the lead to the end of the race.

Villeneuve had a minor accident that damaged his front wing. The wing flew up only to be stuck up in the air, blocking Villeneuve&#x27;s race-line vision. With his forward vision impaired, he used his peripheral vision to navigate using the yellow track markers as reference. After racing this way for minutes he used vibration on the ribbed curbing, to the point it flew off the car. This way he managed to keep control until the end of the race, without a front wing and under the rain.

Mansell pitted for slicks, convinced the weather would turn. It did not. Within minutes he spun, heavily damaging his rear wing, and was pushed by marshals back onto the circuit. Driving slowly toward the L&#x27;Epingle at the northern end, he placed his JPS Lotus in the middle of the track but slowly edging to his left onto the racing line, at the braking area. Prost, on the racing line and much faster, tried unsuccessfully to avoid colliding but could not, resulting in both drivers retiring from the race.

Watson was able to catch and pass Villeneuve a few laps later and the two finished second and third respectively, with Villeneuve clinching his third and last podium of the year on home soil. Bruno Giacomelli of Alfa Romeo, who had started fifteenth, came home fourth, with pole-man Piquet coming in behind him.

<text>The 1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 17, 1981, in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. It was the fifteenth and final race of the 1981 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 75-lap race was won by Australian driver Alan Jones, driving a Williams-Ford, with Frenchman Alain Prost second in a Renault and Italian Bruno Giacomelli third in an Alfa Romeo. Brazilian Nelson Piquet finished fifth in his Brabham-Ford to take the Drivers&#x27; Championship by one point from Jones&#x27;s Argentine teammate, Carlos Reutemann, who finished eighth having started from pole position. This was the final win by an Australian driver until Mark Webber won the 2009 German Grand Prix.

==Summary==

===Championship permutations===

Going into this race, three drivers were in contention for the World Championship. Argentine Carlos Reutemann, driving a Williams-Ford, had 49 points having won two races, while Brazilian Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-Ford, had 48 having won three. Frenchman Jacques Laffite, driving a Ligier-Matra, had an outside chance on 43, having won two races including the previous race in Canada.

Laffite needed to win this race with Reutemann finishing no higher than fourth and Piquet no higher than third, or to finish second with neither Reutemann nor Piquet finishing in the top six. If Laffite won with Piquet third and Reutemann fourth, then all three drivers would finish on 52 points, and the Frenchman would then win the Championship on a tie-break, with the same number of wins as Piquet but more second places than the Brazilian (two to one). He would also win the Championship if he finished second with neither Reutemann nor Piquet scoring, as he and Reutemann would both have 49 points and the same numbers of wins and second places, but he would have more third places than the Argentine (three to two).

If Laffite failed to finish first or second, then all Reutemann had to do was finish ahead of Piquet, while Piquet had to finish in the top five and ahead of Reutemann.

===The setting===
This was the third year in succession that the United States hosted the final round of the World Championship. This time, however, it took place in Las Vegas, instead of Watkins Glen in upstate New York: after twenty years on the Grand Prix schedule, the organizers at Watkins Glen were unable to fulfill financial obligations for 1981.

The track, created on the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel, had a smooth surface and provided speeds averaging over 160 km/h or 100 mph, as well as plenty of overtaking opportunities. Unusually, however, its direction was counter-clockwise, which strained the drivers&#x27; necks, which were accustomed to the more common clockwise circuits. This, together with the desert heat, meant that the drivers&#x27; endurance would be tested in the extreme all weekend. Even in practice, Piquet suffered noticeably and became physically sick; he later got a 90-minute massage from Sugar Ray Leonard&#x27;s masseur to help sort out his troubled back and &quot;Las Vegas neck&quot;.

===Qualifying===

The Williams drivers, Alan Jones and Reutemann, were fastest from the start of the first practice with points leader Reutemann the faster of the two. Later, Jones became the only other driver to break 1:18 in qualifying, and the starting front row was all Williams. Reutemann was not expecting any help winning the Championship from teammate Jones, who explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t see how I can help him; I would not go holding up people as I am a member of the British Commonwealth (Australia, specifically) and I would consider that unsporting.&quot;

===Race===

In the race on Saturday, Jones jumped off the line into the lead, but Reutemann was quickly passed by Gilles Villeneuve, Alain Prost and Bruno Giacomelli, and finished the first lap in fifth. By the end of lap two, Jones had a five-second lead. Further down the field Patrick Tambay lost control of his Ligier, hitting a tyre wall positioned ahead of a concrete barrier with a force high enough to tear off the front of his car. Luckily, Tambay escaped with only minor injuries. Prost passed Villeneuve on lap three, but could not get close enough to challenge Jones for the lead. Villeneuve, meanwhile, kept a line of cars behind him as he fought off the advances of Giacomelli. This allowed Mario Andretti to move right on to Piquet&#x27;s tail, as he desperately tried to overtake Reutemann.

The Brazilian was nearly touching the back of the Williams as they approached the last left-hander before the pits on lap 17. Piquet got around Reutemann on the inside when Reutemann, fighting for the Championship, inexplicably braked early. Piquet said, &quot;I saw his car getting worse oversteer, then he braked very early, I think in the hope I would run into him, but I saw it and passed easily.&quot; On the next lap, Andretti also went by. Piquet passed John Watson on lap 22, and put himself in a position to score points when he took over sixth place. Reutemann continued to slip backwards with gearbox trouble, having lost fourth gear as early as lap two.

The Ferrari team was trying to decide whether to call Villeneuve in on lap 23 after he had been disqualified for lining up on the grid improperly, but when he pulled off the track with an engine fire, the point was moot. On lap 30, crowd favorite Andretti retired from fourth place with broken suspension.

With 15 laps still to go, but a 40-second lead over Prost, Jones began pacing himself to the finish. Giacomelli was third, having worked his way back after spinning from fourth to tenth, and Nigel Mansell had passed Piquet for fourth.

Piquet, in fact, was on the verge of physical exhaustion with his head visibly rolling around in the cockpit, but he still held fifth place and the two points he needed for the Championship. Piquet&#x27;s condition was the only question left about how the Championship would turn out, for Reutemann, driving without fourth gear, was passed by Watson and Laffite, dropping to eighth place on lap 69.

Laffite took sixth place and the final point from Watson on the last corner of the last lap, while Giacomelli missed taking second from Prost, on failing tires, by a few car lengths, thus finishing third and achieving his only career&#x27;s podium in Formula One. Piquet took fifteen minutes to recover from heat exhaustion after making it to the finish, but he had collected the two points for fifth place, and was the new World Champion.

<text>The 1982 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 23 January 1982. It was the first race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship. It was the 28th edition of the South African Grand Prix and the 16th time that the race had been held at Kyalami.

The prelude to the race was notable for a strike action by the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association, led by Niki Lauda and Didier Pironi, in protest at the new superlicence conditions imposed by FISA, which would have tied the drivers to a single team for up to three years. A late compromise was reached and the race went ahead. The drivers were subsequently fined between US$5,000 and US$10,000 and handed suspended race bans; however, the FIA Court of Appeal later reduced the penalties and criticised FISA&#x27;s handling of the dispute.

Turbocharged cars took the first six positions on the grid. Despite Alain Prost suffering a puncture while leading, he was able to recover to win the race. Lauda, in his first race after two years out of F1, finished fourth. It was the final podium and points finish for Carlos Reutemann (as of 2024, this is the most recent podium finish achieved by an Argentine driver), who retired from Formula One after the next race in Brazil, and the last point finish for an Argentine driver until Franco Colapinto finished 8th and scored 4 points at the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. It also was the last race held in January.

<text>The 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jacarepaguá on 21 March 1982. It was the second round of the 1982 Formula One season. Many drivers suffered exhaustion because of the intensely hot weather, particularly Brabham drivers Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese. Patrese was forced to retire from the race due to total exhaustion. Piquet, after having finished first in the race and then barely making it to the podium ceremony, fainted due to exhaustion only to be disqualified later.

=== Disqualifications ===

Nelson Piquet finished first and Keke Rosberg finished second, but both were disqualified after the cars were found to be underweight. As a result, the FOCA teams boycotted San Marino two races later. The problem was with a &quot;ballast water tank&quot;, ostensibly used to cool the brakes. This would gradually empty during the race and then be replenished at the end so as to pass post-race scrutineering. The FIA Appeals Tribunal upheld the disqualification seven weeks later and these tanks were permanently banned.

==Notes==

* This was the 200th Grand Prix in which an Argentinian driver participated. In those 200 races, Argentinian drivers had won 38 Grands Prix, achieved 100 podium finishes, 38 pole positions, 33 fastest laps, 10 Grand Slams and 5 World Championships.
* This was the 10th fastest lap and the 1st Grand Slam for Renault and a Renault-powered car.

<text>The 1982 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 25 April 1982 at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari, Imola, Italy. It was the fourth race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship. The race was boycotted by many teams as part of a political war, unrelated to the event itself, involving the two dominant forces within Formula One, the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) and the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA). Only seven teams took part, giving a field of 14 cars.

The 60-lap race was won by Frenchman Didier Pironi, driving a Ferrari, with Canadian teammate Gilles Villeneuve second and Italian Michele Alboreto third in a Tyrrell-Ford. After the Renaults of René Arnoux and Alain Prost retired, Villeneuve led from Pironi before the Ferrari team ordered both drivers to slow down, with Alboreto far behind. Villeneuve interpreted this as an order to maintain position on the track; Pironi did not and thus overtook Villeneuve on the final lap, infuriating the Canadian to the point that he vowed never to speak to Pironi again. Villeneuve would lose his life in a crash during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks later.

== Summary ==
In a decision relating to the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg were excluded for their cars&#x27; use of water tanks as ballast to keep them under the weight limit during race conditions. The Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA) protested, and decided to boycott the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix.

Most of the FOCA-aligned teams, including Brabham, McLaren, Williams and Lotus, boycotted the race. However, the Tyrrell, Osella, ATS and Toleman teams broke the boycott, citing &quot;sponsor obligations&quot;. They joined the FISA-aligned Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo teams in the race, giving a total of 14 cars.

The Renaults of René Arnoux and Alain Prost qualified first and second, but their cars failed in the race, leaving Ferrari occupying the top two positions with Gilles Villeneuve leading Didier Pironi. The third-placed Tyrrell of Michele Alboreto was far behind, so Ferrari ordered their drivers to slow down to minimize the risk of mechanical failure or running out of fuel. Villeneuve believed this order also meant that the cars were to maintain position on the track, with Villeneuve ahead of Pironi. However, Pironi believed that the cars were free to race, and passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve believed that Pironi was simply trying to spice up an otherwise dull race, and duly re-passed his teammate, assuming that he would then hold station for the remainder of the race. Thus, Villeneuve failed to protect the inside line going into the Tosa corner on the final lap, and Pironi passed him to take the win. Villeneuve was irate at what he saw as Pironi&#x27;s betrayal, although opinion inside the Ferrari team was split over the true meaning of the order to slow down. Villeneuve&#x27;s expression was sullen on the podium, enraged by Pironi&#x27;s actions. He was quoted afterwards as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll never speak to Pironi again in my life.&quot; They proved to be prophetic words, as he was still not on speaking terms with his teammate when he died during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks later. Pironi&#x27;s pass on Villeneuve is considered to be one of the most controversial moments in Formula One.

Manfred Winkelhock was disqualified for his car being underweight in post-race scrutineering.

Despite most of the FOCA-aligned teams boycotting the race it still counted towards the World Championship. This was a bone of contention with the FOCA teams as two previous races held during the war (the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix and the 1981 South African Grand Prix) which had seen all three manufacturer teams boycotting had been down-graded to non-championship races and had not counted towards the championship or official records.

<text>The 1982 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zolder on 9 May 1982. It was the fifth round of the 1982 Formula One season. The race was heavily overshadowed by the death of Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve, who died shortly after a crash in qualifying. 

==Qualifying and death of Gilles Villeneuve==
Gilles Villeneuve was killed in an accident during the final qualifying session. At the time of the crash, his teammate Didier Pironi had set a time 0.1s faster than Villeneuve for sixth place. Contemporary and more recent writers say that he was attempting to improve his time on his final lap. Some suggest that he was specifically aiming to beat Pironi due to bitterness at being passed by him two weeks earlier in the closing stages of the San Marino Grand Prix, when Villeneuve believed Pironi had been ordered to remain behind him. Villeneuve&#x27;s biographer Gerald Donaldson quotes Ferrari race engineer Mauro Forghieri as saying that the Canadian, although pressing on in his usual fashion, was returning to the pits on his last set of qualifying tyres when the accident occurred. If so, he would not have set a time on that lap.

With eight minutes of the session left, Villeneuve came over the rise after the first chicane and found Jochen Mass in the March travelling much more slowly through &quot;Butte&quot;, the left-handed bend before the &quot;Terlamenbocht&quot; corner. Mass saw Villeneuve approaching at high speed and moved to the right to let him through on the racing line. At the same instant Villeneuve also moved right to pass Mass. The Ferrari hit the back of the March and was launched into the air at a speed estimated at 200–225 km/h (120–140 mph). It was airborne for over 100 metres before nosediving into the ground and disintegrating as it somersaulted along the edge of the track. Villeneuve, still strapped to his seat but without his helmet, was thrown a further 50 metres from the wreckage into the catch fencing on the outside edge of &quot;Terlamenbocht&quot;.

Several drivers stopped and rushed to the scene. John Watson and Derek Warwick pulled Villeneuve, his face blue, from the catch fencing. The first doctor arrived on the scene within 35 seconds to find that Villeneuve was not breathing, although his pulse continued throughout; he was intubated and ventilated before being transferred to the circuit medical centre and then by helicopter to University St Raphael Hospital where a fatal fracture of the neck was diagnosed. Villeneuve was kept alive on life support while his wife travelled to the hospital and the doctors consulted with specialists worldwide. He died at 9:12 that evening.

The Ferrari team withdrew from the race after the accident and left the circuit. The final eight minutes of the qualifying were run after the crash debris had been removed. No drivers improved their times, leaving the Renaults of Alain Prost and René Arnoux on the front row of the grid.

==Abbreviated race summary==
John Watson won the race after taking the lead on the penultimate lap from Keke Rosberg, who was struggling on worn tires. Niki Lauda finished third on the road but was disqualified when his car was found to be underweight in post-race scrutineering, and so the final podium place went to Eddie Cheever.

<doc id="1122821" wikidata="Q7627973" url="?curid=1122821" title="Students for Sensible Drug Policy">
<text>Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) is an international nonprofit organization advocacy and education organization with focus on drug policy, war on drugs, marijuana legalization, psychedelics, juvenile justice and youth rights, drug decriminalization, criminal justice reform. SSDP promotes global youth civic engagement as a tool in reforming drug policy.

SSDP has expanded from a single chapter in upstate New York created by a handful of students to a network of over 150 chapters worldwide.

==Board==

SSDP is governed by a board of directors and a board of trustees, a designated body of the board of directors. Together, they are responsible for crafting strategy for the organization, overseeing compliance and financial affairs, and overseeing SSDP’s Executive Director. At least two-thirds of the members of SSDP&#x27;s board of directors are students or young people elected by SSDP&#x27;s chapters each year during the organization&#x27;s national Congress. Maya Tatum, Arizona State University Tempe campus, is the current chair.

==Main issues==
=== Marijuana policy reform ===
Students and chapters work on marijuana policy reform at the local, state, and federal levels by supporting legislation and ballot initiatives for decriminalization, medical marijuana, adult-use taxation and regulation, and social equity measures for communities disproportionately targeted by marijuana prohibition.

=== Psychedelic policy reform ===
SSDP provides resources for its members to advocate for psychedelic policy reform, such as psychedelic therapy programs and allowing the research of currently prohibited psychedelic substances by researchers.

=== Ending student drug testing ===
Students should not have to submit to a drug test at random or to participate in extracurricular activities.

=== Global drug policy ===
SSDP is a member of the Economic and Social Council and thus a consultant to its functional commissions. As such, SSDP has been advocating for policy reform and youth inclusion at the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, including the 2016 Special Session of the UN General Assembly on the World Drug Problem and the High Level Ministerial Segment in 2019.

SSDP Global Drug Policy and Development Consultant, Orsi Fehér, held the office of Treasurer on the board of the Vienna NGO Committee on Drugs between 2018–2020.

SSDP&#x27;s former International Program Coordinator, Jake Agliata, is a co-founder of the Paradigma Youth Coalition.

The organization also coordinates youth participation in global campaigns such as Support. Don&#x27;t Punish and International Overdose Awareness Day.

Portugal&#x27;s drug policy, implemented in 2001, is based on the principle of harm reduction. Drug use and possession for personal use are no longer criminal offenses but administrative ones. Instead of facing criminal charges, individuals caught with drugs are referred to a Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, where they receive a health assessment and may be recommended for treatment. Portugal’s drug policy has been successful in reducing drug use and associated harms, including HIV infections and overdose deaths.

=== Drug decriminalization ===
SSDP encourages chapters to create and support campaigns to decriminalize simple drug possession and other low-level crimes associated with drug use.

=== &quot;Just Say Know&quot; drug education ===
Just Say Know is a peer-to-peer drug education program, provides evidence-based drug information on campus and empowers them to reduce drug-related harm within their communities.

==Campus chapters==
SSDP is made up of students and community members organized on college and high school campuses across the world. In 2015–2016, SSDP chapters were on 320 campuses, included 4,312 student activists and engaged in 135 drug policy initiatives. In 2021, the movement expanded to over 30 countries and all six habitable continents.

=== International ===
SSDP’s international chapters engage in reform from their campus and community to the United Nations, representing the voices of youth from their countries and sharing their experiences fighting the drug war with their fellow SSDPers all over the world.

SSDP’s international network has doubled in size through 2018 and expanded its structure to include regional fellowships to represent the specific needs of the Latin American, West African and European chapters.

<doc id="1122823" wikidata="Q171492" url="?curid=1122823" title="1982 Monaco Grand Prix">
<text>The 1982 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 23 May 1982. It was the sixth race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship. This was the first race meeting following the death of Gilles Villeneuve at the Belgian Grand Prix qualifying two weeks previously. Consequently, Ferrari entered only one car, for Didier Pironi.

René Arnoux took pole position in his Renault and led until he spun off at the Swimming Pool on lap 15. Team-mate Alain Prost took over the lead and held it until the closing stages, when rain started to fall. On lap 74, three from the end, Prost pushed too hard and crashed into the Armco barriers coming out of the Chicane du Port (also known as the Dog Leg), handing the lead to Riccardo Patrese in the Brabham. Then, on lap 75, Patrese spun on oil at the Loews hairpin and stalled.

Pironi now led, but his battery was not charged properly before the race and the engine started misfiring on the last lap and finally stopped in the tunnel on the final lap. Andrea de Cesaris then ran out of fuel before he could pass Pironi, and Derek Daly, the next leader, had already lost the wings from his Williams after an accident and had also damaged his gearbox, which seized up before he could start the final lap. Patrese, who had managed to restart his car by rolling downhill and bump-starting, came through to take his first Formula One victory, with Pironi, de Cesaris and Daly classified second, third and sixth respectively.

BBC commentator and 1976 world champion James Hunt commented, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve got this ridiculous situation where we&#x27;re all sitting by the start-finish line waiting for a winner to come past, and we don&#x27;t seem to be getting one!&quot;

<doc id="1122824" wikidata="Q65514" url="?curid=1122824" title="1982 Canadian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on 13 June 1982. It was the eighth race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship. This was the first Canadian Grand Prix to be held in June, the organisers having moved the race from the autumn to allow for warmer weather; it has been held in June ever since.

The 70-lap race was won by Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-BMW. It was the first Formula One victory for a BMW-engined car, but the only victory of the season for defending Drivers&#x27; Champion Piquet. Team-mate Riccardo Patrese finished second in an older Brabham-Ford, with John Watson third in a McLaren-Ford.

==Death of Riccardo Paletti==

The race was marred by the death of Italian driver Riccardo Paletti, in only his second F1 race start. At the start, the lights took an unusually long time to turn to green. During this time, Didier Pironi, who had the pole position, stalled the engine of his Ferrari. Pironi lifted his hand to signal the problem just as the lights switched to green, which was too late to abort the start. The other cars swerved across the track, trying to squeeze past Pironi&#x27;s stationary car. Raul Boesel just clipped the back left of the Ferrari, spinning his March into the path of Eliseo Salazar and Jochen Mass. Salazar, Boesel and Mass suffered minor impacts but it looked as if everyone had passed the Ferrari without serious consequences. However, Paletti could not react in time and slammed into the rear of the stranded Ferrari at , catapulting it into the path of Geoff Lees. The Osella&#x27;s nose was crushed in severely.

Due to the force of the severe impact, Paletti sustained heavy chest injuries and was lying unconscious in his car, wedged against the steering wheel. Didier Pironi and Sid Watkins, the FIA&#x27;s head doctor, were on the scene to stabilise and assist Paletti. As Watkins climbed over the wreckage of the Osella, the petrol from the fuel tank ignited, enveloping the car in a wall of fire. When the fire was finally put out, the injured Paletti was without a pulse. It took the rescue workers 25 minutes to cut him out safely from his wrecked car, as the sparks caused by the cutting equipment threatened to re-ignite the petrol on the track. He was flown by a medical helicopter to the Royal Victoria Hospital, where he died soon after arriving. His mother was watching from the stands, as they were to celebrate his 24th birthday later that week. Paletti suffered a torn aorta as well as fractures to both legs. According to track doctor Jacques Bouchard his pupils were already dilated (indicating brain death) when medical personnel arrived and that the extended extraction time made no difference to his chances of survival.Paletti was the last driver to lose his life in a Formula One car until Elio de Angelis was killed while testing for Brabham at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France in 1986, and was the last fatality at a Formula One race weekend until Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

<text>The 1982 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on 3 July 1982. The race, contested over 72 laps, was the ninth race of the 1982 Formula One season and was won by Didier Pironi, driving a Ferrari, with Nelson Piquet second in a Brabham-BMW and Keke Rosberg third in a Williams-Ford.

René Arnoux started from pole position, but he crashed out at the notorious Tarzan Corner when his Renault&#x27;s throttle stuck open and he hit the tyre barriers. Arnoux walked away from the crash unharmed.

This was the first Grand Prix after the death of Riccardo Paletti three weeks earlier in Montreal. This was also the final win of Didier Pironi&#x27;s Formula One career.

Ferrari entered Patrick Tambay to replace Gilles Villeneuve, who had been killed during qualifying a few race weekends prior, at the Belgian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1982 British Grand Prix (formally the XXXV Marlboro British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch on 18 July 1982. It was the tenth race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship.

The 76-lap race was won by Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-Ford, after he started from fifth position. Didier Pironi finished second in a Ferrari, while teammate Patrick Tambay achieved his first podium finish by coming third. Derek Warwick stunned and delighted the British fans by taking his Toleman, a team who frequently failed to qualify for Grand Prix races during 1981 and 1982, through the field into second place before being forced to retire; he subsequently revealed that to impress its lead sponsor, Toleman had sent him out on a half-tank of fuel so that he could outpace his fully loaded competitors before running out of fuel. Pironi took over the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship from Lauda&#x27;s teammate, John Watson, who spun off on the third lap.

<text>The 1982 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Paul Ricard on 25 July 1982. It was the eleventh race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship.

The 54-lap race was won from pole position by René Arnoux, driving a Renault. The turbocharged Renaults, Ferraris and Brabham-BMWs took up the first six grid positions, and Arnoux led home a French 1–2–3–4, with teammate Alain Prost second and the Ferraris of Didier Pironi and Patrick Tambay third and fourth, respectively. Arnoux achieved his win in sour circumstances, as he violated a pre-race agreement that if he and Prost were running first and second, respectively, he would let Prost past to aid his Drivers&#x27; Championship hopes. Arnoux left Renault at the end of the year.

The top six was completed by Keke Rosberg in the Williams-Ford and Michele Alboreto in the Tyrrell-Ford. Pironi&#x27;s third place enabled him to extend his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to nine points, although this would turn out to be his last finish before his career-ending accident at the next race in Germany.

The eleventh lap of this race saw a big accident when Jochen Mass&#x27;s March and Mauro Baldi&#x27;s Arrows collided at Signes. Mass&#x27;s car went through the catch fencing into the tyre walls, then catapulted into a spectator area and caught fire. Mass escaped with burns on his hands, while several spectators were injured. The West German driver retired from Formula One immediately after this race.

<text>The 1982 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 8 August 1982. It was won by Patrick Tambay for Scuderia Ferrari. René Arnoux finished second in a Renault with Keke Rosberg third for Williams. This was the last race for Didier Pironi as he crashed heavily during qualifying sustaining injuries ending his championship hopes.

==Report==
===Qualifying===
Hockenheim had been modified from the year before, with the first chicane being made slower and another chicane added to slow cars through the very fast Ostkurve. Didier Pironi set the fastest practice time, but was seriously injured in qualifying for this Grand Prix and never raced in Formula One again. With the track wet thanks to persistent showers, Pironi was on a quick lap when his Ferrari hit the back of Alain Prost&#x27;s slow moving Renault at high speed, vaulting over the top of it before landing tail-first and cartwheeling to a stop in eerie similarity to Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s fatal accident earlier in the season. Pironi survived but suffered severe leg injuries that sidelined him for the rest of the year. He never managed to return to Formula One and died in 1987. Pironi&#x27;s accident also had a profound effect on Prost who never forgot the sight of the Ferrari flying over his car, the crash firming his views on the danger of driving Formula One cars in the wet, where visibility was virtually zero when following behind another car.

Thanks to Hockenheim&#x27;s long straights, the turbocharged cars were overwhelmingly dominant in qualifying. Not only did turbocharged cars take up the first six grid positions, but the utmost proof of this was how Riccardo Patrese, who placed 6th in the turbocharged Brabham-BMW, was 2.9 seconds faster than the fastest non-turbo qualifier, Michele Alboreto in 7th driving a Ford-Cosworth powered Tyrrell. The Toleman pair of Derek Warwick and Teo Fabi could not use the turbocharged Hart engines to their advantage, with Warwick only managing 14th position and Fabi failing to qualify.

===Race===
Since Ferrari never withdrew the injured Pironi, pole position was left empty at the start. Nelson Piquet led the race, but collided with Eliseo Salazar while lapping him at the new Ostkurve chicane. Piquet ripped his seatbelt off before his car had stopped moving. After the two cars came to a stop, an irate Piquet quickly climbed out of his Brabham, approached Salazar, and then punched and kicked Salazar in a rage, which continued for some time after the collision. Patrick Tambay, driving the lone Ferrari, won his first Formula One race.

Several months later, a mechanic revealed that Piquet&#x27;s BMW engine was suffering from mechanical issues and would have blown up anyway had he not been taken out by the crash. Piquet then phoned Salazar, both to apologize for his outburst and to convey the gratitude of BMW executives, several of whom personally attended the race and were thus spared the embarrassment of witnessing their engine failing at their home country Grand Prix.

<text>The 1982 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 15 August 1982. It was the thirteenth race of the 1982 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Italian driver Elio de Angelis, driving a Lotus-Ford. De Angelis held off Finland&#x27;s Keke Rosberg in the Williams-Ford to win by just 0.05 seconds, or less than half a car length, claiming the first victory for Lotus since the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix and the last in the lifetime of team founder Colin Chapman, who died at the end of 1982. Frenchman Jacques Laffite finished third in a Ligier-Matra, one lap behind.

== Report ==
A chicane had been added at the entrance to the pits earlier in the year. Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Brabham led into the first corner from pole position, while Renault&#x27;s Alain Prost passed Piquet&#x27;s team-mate Riccardo Patrese for second. Further back, there was a collision which eliminated the two Alfa Romeos of Andrea de Cesaris and Bruno Giacomelli, as well as the Williams of Derek Daly. Prost&#x27;s advantage over Patrese lasted only a few corners before the Italian re-passed him. On lap 2, Patrick Tambay punctured the right rear tyre on his Ferrari, Michele Alboreto crashed his Tyrrell at the Bosch Kurve, Patrese took the lead from Piquet and the two Brabhams immediately began to pull away on their half-full tanks.

Shortly before half distance, Piquet made the first planned mid-race fuel and tyre pit stop in modern F1 history. He rejoined in fourth place, behind Prost and Elio de Angelis, and just ahead of Keke Rosberg. Shortly afterwards, Patrese made his stop, having built up a sufficient lead to rejoin the race still in first place. However, the Italian suffered an engine failure three laps later, leaving Prost to inherit a comfortable lead from de Angelis.

Piquet was back up to third but was now in trouble, unable to make any inroads into the leaders and struggling to stay ahead of Rosberg. On lap 32, the Brazilian retired with an electrical failure. Free of the Brabham, Rosberg began closing in on de Angelis, who at this point was ten seconds ahead.

Prost was leading by half a minute when on lap 49, five from the end, his Renault suffered a mechanical failure. This left de Angelis and Rosberg – neither of whom had won a Grand Prix before – battling for the lead. At the start of the last lap de Angelis was 1.6 seconds ahead. Rosberg closed rapidly on the final tour and was right on the Lotus&#x27;s gearbox heading into the final corner, the Rindt Kurve. De Angelis calmly defended the inside line, but slid wide on the exit of the corner. Rosberg dived inside on the home straight, only to come up short by 0.050 seconds, or less than half a car length.

De Angelis joyfully celebrated his maiden win, while Rosberg had nonetheless boosted his Driver&#x27;s Championship chances, moving into second place ahead of John Watson, who had suffered an engine failure. Ligier&#x27;s Jacques Laffite completed the podium, coming home a lap down, while Patrick Tambay was fourth in the sole Ferrari, having recovered from a puncture early in the race. Watson&#x27;s McLaren team-mate Niki Lauda was fifth, with Mauro Baldi taking the final point in his Arrows.

This was the 150th World Championship race victory for the Cosworth DFV engine. However, it was also to be the last hailed by Colin Chapman&#x27;s famous act of throwing his cloth cap into the air after a Lotus victory, as Chapman would die four months later. It was also the last win by a Chapman-built Lotus, and the team&#x27;s last win until the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix.

<text>The 1982 Swiss Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Dijon-Prenois in France on 29 August 1982. The race, contested over 80 laps, was the fourteenth race of the 1982 Formula One season and was won by Keke Rosberg, driving a Williams-Ford. Alain Prost finished second in a Renault, having started from pole position, while Niki Lauda was third in a McLaren-Ford. This was the only win of the season for eventual World Champion Rosberg. The chequered flag was shown after 81 laps when the organizers / flag stand missed the leading car on lap 80.

This was the first World Championship Swiss Grand Prix since 1954 (despite it not being held in Switzerland), and the last running of the event to date. Switzerland had banned motor racing after the 1955 Le Mans disaster; as of 2021, the ban has been lifted for electric vehicles only. Patrick Tambay, Ferrari&#x27;s only entry after team leader Didier Pironi&#x27;s career-ending crash three weeks earlier, was unable to start due to a pinched nerve in his back. This was the last of only three times the Ferrari team did not start a World Championship race in which they entered (see also 1950 French Grand Prix and 1982 Belgian Grand Prix). Ferrari withdrew their entry so late that Chico Serra (the fastest non-qualifier) was not allowed to start.

<text>The 1982 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 12 September 1982. This was the final pole position, podium, finish, and points for 1978 World Champion Mario Andretti at this race. René Arnoux won the race. Arnoux announced he would be replacing Andretti at Ferrari in 1983. Arnoux finished ahead of Ferrari driver Patrick Tambay, and Mario Andretti in the second Ferrari finished third. John Watson&#x27;s fourth place put him 9 points behind Keke Rosberg (who finished outside the points after his rear wing came off and he had to pit in order for his team to replace it) with an outside chance of winning the Drivers&#x27; Title at the final race at Caesars Palace, where Ferrari, McLaren, and Renault would battle for the Constructors&#x27; Title. Both Brabham cars ran strongly early on but dropped out after several laps due to mechanical failures, a problem that would often compromise their otherwise fast package in 1982.

<text>The 1982 Caesars Palace Grand Prix (the retronym Las Vegas Grand Prix has been used by Formula One broadcasts since 2023) was a Formula One motor race held on September 25, 1982 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1982 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the second F1 race in Las Vegas, and the last F1 race to be held in Caesars Palace.

The 75-lap race was won by Michele Alboreto, driving a Tyrrell-Ford. Alboreto scored Tyrrell&#x27;s first victory since the 1978 Monaco Grand Prix, becoming the eleventh different winning driver of 1982 while Tyrrell became the seventh different winning constructor. John Watson finished second in a McLaren-Ford, with Eddie Cheever third in a Ligier-Matra. Keke Rosberg finished fifth in his Williams-Ford to secure the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Ferrari taking the Constructors&#x27; Championship despite neither car finishing in the top six. 

This was the last F1 race for 1978 World Champion Mario Andretti. It was also the last race for the Ensign and Fittipaldi teams, the last for March until , and the last for Matra as an engine supplier. This would be last Grand Prix held in Las Vegas for just over 41 years until the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix held on a new circuit utilising the Las Vegas Strip.

==Background==
When the 1982 Formula One schedule was first released in October 1981, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix was scheduled for Saturday, October 16, 1982. 

In anticipation of the second year in Las Vegas, race organizers attempted to make the weekend even larger by also scheduling an CART Indy car race. The weekend would consist of a Can-Am race on Friday, the Formula One Grand Prix on Saturday, then the track would be converted to an oval for Indy cars on Sunday. 

Shortly after CART announced their 1982 schedule confirming the Las Vegas race twin bill, the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) announced the Caesars Palace Grand Prix would be moved to September 25. Jean-Marie Balestre, head of FISA, explained this was done to shorten the one month wait between the Italian Grand Prix and the Caesars Palace Grand Prix. It was also done so the American television broadcaster, NBC, would not have a conflict with their coverage of the 1982 World Series being held the same weekend. This new date was in conflict with CART&#x27;s previously scheduled race at Michigan International Speedway. Furthermore, FISA prevented any future F1-IndyCar combination weekends by instituting a rule that banned two open-wheel series with engines over two liters from competing at the same venue on the same weekend. 

In response, CART president John Frasco said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know all the politics, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious FISA doesn&#x27;t want to race with us... I didn&#x27;t think we were competing against each other because we would be racing on different configurations. Caesars Palace thought the doubleheader concept was fascinating, so did Bernie Ecclestone, and so did we. But obviously, other people involved didn&#x27;t feel that way.&quot;

==Qualifying report==
For the first time since the World Championship began in 1950, a country hosted three rounds in the same season in 1982. The final race of the year, and the third in the US, would once again decide the Championship. Keke Rosberg of Williams had 42 points, to 33 for McLaren&#x27;s John Watson, and needed to finish sixth or better to secure the title. Meanwhile, the race was former world champion Mario Andretti&#x27;s final grand prix.

The course&#x27;s tight turns and short straights allowed the non-turbo cars to be more competitive than usual, with Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Tyrrell and Eddie Cheever&#x27;s Talbot Ligier fastest among them. The turbocharged Renaults of Alain Prost and René Arnoux took first and second positions in qualifying, more than eight-tenths clear of Alboreto. The two Championship contenders, Rosberg and Watson, meanwhile, were in sixth and ninth places respectively, separated by the Ferraris of Mario Andretti and Patrick Tambay.

==Championship permutations==
Rosberg and Watson both entered this race with a chance of winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship.
* Rosberg (42 points) needed either
** 6th or higher
** Watson 2nd or lower
* Watson (33 points) needed to win the race, with Rosberg 7th or lower. Had this happened, both drivers would have finished with 42 points, and Watson would have been champion by virtue of having three wins to Rosberg&#x27;s one.
* The injured Didier Pironi exited championship contention before the race on the grounds of being absent from the event.
For the first time since , three teams entered the final race with a chance of winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship.
* Ferrari (74 points) needed either
** 2nd (or 4th and 5th) or better
** 4th (or 5th and 6th) or better, with the McLarens 1st and 3rd or lower
** 5th or better, with the McLarens 1st and 4th or lower
** 6th or better, with the McLarens 1st and 5th or lower
** the McLarens scoring fewer than 11 points, with the Renaults 1st and 3rd or lower
* McLaren-Ford (63 points) needed 1st and either
** 2nd with the Ferraris scoring fewer than 5 points
** 3rd with the Ferraris scoring fewer than 3 points
** 4th with the Ferraris 6th or lower
** 5th with the Ferraris 7th or lower
* Renault (59 points) needed 1st and 2nd, with the Ferraris 7th or lower. Had this happened, both teams would have finished with 74 points, with Renault then winning by virtue of having five wins to Ferrari&#x27;s three.

==Race report==
At the green light for the race on Saturday, Prost led from the pole, followed by teammate Arnoux. Cheever, from the fourth spot on the grid, was determined to get around the outside of Alboreto on the first left-hander. They touched wheels, but both continued with Alboreto still in front, Cheever&#x27;s Ligier sporting a vibrating front wheel and the Tyrrell of Alboreto bearing a tire mark on the right sidepod.

For the first ten laps, the Renaults steadily pulled away from Alboreto, with Arnoux now leading Prost. The Tyrrell began to match Arnoux&#x27;s times, however, and then to close on him, as Prost took back the lead on lap 15. Speculation of a problem with Arnoux&#x27;s car proved true, as the Renault was faltering, and he retired on lap 21.

Watson, meanwhile, had dropped to twelfth in the opening laps, but passed Piquet on lap 12, then Rosberg, Andretti and Cheever on successive laps, eventually reaching third place, with a thirty-second gap to the two leaders. However, when Andretti, hoping to help clinch the Constructors&#x27; title for Ferrari, slid off directly in front of Rosberg on lap 27 with a broken rear suspension link, Rosberg took over the fifth place he sought.

Among the leaders, Alboreto began inching closer to Prost again, and Watson continued to close on both of them. Niki Lauda&#x27;s McLaren retired on lap 54, while Alboreto had eliminated the gap to Prost, and gotten by him to take the lead in a Grand Prix for the first time. Prost&#x27;s tires were picking up rubber and had developed a vibration. In four more laps, Watson had also caught and passed him, but he was having the same problem as Prost, and so could make no progress on Alboreto.

Alboreto cruised to a comfortable victory, his first ever and the first for Tyrrell in four years. Alboreto was the 11th different victor that year. Cheever was also able to overtake the ailing Prost for third, nine laps from the end. Less than three seconds behind Prost, and the last car on the lead lap, was Rosberg, who therefore won the world title. Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship despite not finishing in the points.

<doc id="1122840" wikidata="Q1426619" url="?curid=1122840" title="Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)">
<text>Pendulum is the sixth studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released by Fantasy Records on December 9, 1970. It was the second studio album the band released that year, arriving five months after &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;.

==Background==
The album was recorded at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco, and took a month to complete, which was an unusually long time for the band. On previous albums, they had rehearsed songs before entering the studio, but, for &quot;Pendulum&quot;, the members learned the songs in the studio. The backing tracks of the songs were performed by the whole band, and the various members then recorded the wide variety of vocal and instrumental overdubs.

It is the last album the band recorded while Tom Fogerty was still a member, as he left the group in early 1971 to start a solo career; and the last of the band&#x27;s albums to be produced solely by John Fogerty. 

==Musical Style==
&quot;Pendulum&quot; expands the band&#x27;s sonic palette with instruments such as keyboards and saxophones, in contrast to the group&#x27;s previous albums, which were dominated by the guitar, as well as a saxophone section played entirely by John Fogerty. John also played the Hammond B3 organ on many of the &quot;Pendulum&quot; tracks, notably in &quot;Have You Ever Seen The Rain?&quot;, in recognition of the deep respect and influence of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, with whom the members of the band had jammed. It also contains, in the closing instrumental &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot;, a venture into avant-garde psychedelia.

Notably, the album is the only one by Creedence Clearwater Revival to not contain any cover songs, but was also the last album by Creedence where all the original songs were written by John. 

==Release and Reception==

&quot;Pendulum&quot; was released in December 1970 and proved to be another hit for the band, charting within the top 10 in 10 countries, and peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard 200. The only single taken from the album, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&quot;/&quot;Hey Tonight&quot;, was released in January 1971, and reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

Robert Christgau enjoyed the album and rated it an A-, despite criticizing &quot;Molina&quot; and &quot;Pagan Baby,&quot; as, &quot;slightly subpar,&quot; &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Lament&quot; as, &quot;a little more so,&quot; and &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot; as &quot;a pretentious moment I hope--and expect--he [John Fogerty] has the sense never to repeat.&quot; However, he praises the other six songs on the album as &quot;so superpar Steve Barri or Tommy James would kill (or least steal) for them. Ho hum, another Creedence album.&quot;

&quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; has enjoyed extended popularity even into the 21st century, being the band&#x27;s most streamed song on Spotify at 1.9 billion streams.

<text>Saluzzo (; ) is a town and former principality in the province of Cuneo, in the Piedmont region, Italy.

The city of Saluzzo is built on a hill overlooking a vast, well-cultivated plain. Iron, lead, silver, marble, slate etc. are found in the surrounding mountains. On 1 January 2017 it had a population of 17.581

Saluzzo was the birthplace of the writer Silvio Pellico and of typographer Giambattista Bodoni.

==History==

Saluzzo (Salusse in Piedmontese) was a &quot;civitas&quot; (tribal city state) of the Vagienni, or mountain Ligures, and later of the Salluvii. This district was brought under Roman control by the Consul Marcus Fulvius .

In the Carolingian age it became the residence of a count; later, having passed to the Marquesses of Susa, Manfred I, son of Marquess Bonifacio del Vasto, on the division of that principality became Marquess of Saluzzo; this family held the marquisate of Saluzzo from 1142 to 1548. The marquisate embraced the territory lying between the Alps, the Po and the Stura, and was extended on several occasions. In the Middle Ages it had a chequered existence, often being in conflict with powerful neighbours, chiefly the Counts (later Dukes) of Savoy. After Manfred II&#x27;s death, his widow had to accept a series of tributes, which were to be later the base of the House of Savoy&#x27;s claims over the increasingly feebler marquises&#x27; territories. Thomas III, a vassal of France, wrote the romance &quot;Le chevalier errant&quot; (&#x27;the knight-errant&#x27;).

Ludovico I (1416–75) started the Golden Age of the city and imposed himself as a mediator between the neighbouring powers. Ludovico II constructed a tunnel, no longer in use, through the Monviso, a remarkable work for the time. With the help of the French he resisted a vigorous siege by the Duke of Savoy in 1486, but in 1487 yielded and retired to France where he wrote &quot;L&#x27;art de la chevalerie sous Vegèce&quot; (&quot;The art of chivalry under Vegetius&quot;, 1488), a treatise on good government, and other works on military affairs. He was a patron of clerics and authors. In 1490 Ludovico regained power, but after his death, his sons struggled longly for the rule and impoverished the state.

After long struggles for independence, the marquisate was occupied (1548) by the French, as a fief of the Crown of France – with the name of Saluces – and remained part of that kingdom until it was ceded to Savoy in 1601. In 1588 Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy took possession of the city. Thenceforward Saluzzo shared the destinies of Piedmont, with which it formed &quot;one of the keys of the house&quot; of Italy.

The Marquisate of Saluzzo is the setting of Boccaccio&#x27;s tale of Griselda, the final story in the Decameron, as well as Chaucer&#x27;s Clerk&#x27;s Tale in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

The municipality of Saluzzo absorbed at the beginning of 2019 the neighbouring commune of Castellar, thus enforcing the results of a referendum held in the summer of 2018.

== Geography ==
The municipality of Saluces occupies a vast area of in the Po Valley, about east of Mount Viso.
== Duomo ==
The , also known as the Cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary of the Assumption, stands out for its Late-Gothic forms; built outside the walls just beyond Porta Santa Maria between 1491 and 1501, it was a bishop&#x27;s seat starting from 1511. The façade is in exposed brick, adorned by three portals surmounted by terracotta gables that house statues of the apostles (central portal), while above the side there are the patron San Chiaffredo and San Costanzo. The interior has a covering made up of cross vaults, while the Baroque high altar with its large impact is of great impact eleven wooden statues by Carlo Giuseppe Plura and collaborators. In the central nave, you can admire a precious fourteenth-century wooden crucifix. To the left of the main altar is the Chapel of the SS. Sacramento, with a polyptych by the Flemish artist of French origin Hans Clemer, better known as Maestro d&#x27;Elva.

== Toponymy ==
The Marquisate of Saluzzo was the seat of a Piedmontese principality whose history is closely linked to that of its powerful neighbor, the House of Savoy, until its definitive incorporation obtained in 1601 by Duke Charles Emmanuel.

The French name of Saluces was given to the city during the period of French domination. There are many traces of this francization still today as on the pediment of the casa cavassa today transformed into a museum where you can read the motto &quot;right whatever it is.&quot;

==Main sights==
* (1491–1501): Church was built in Lombard-Gothic style. The façade is decorated with rose-windows, frescoes (almost totally faded) and statues. The interior contains a magnificent Baroque high altar, plus a 16th-century terracotta group portraying the &quot;Deposition&quot;, ad &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; by Sebastiano Ricci.
*&quot;San Bernardo&quot; church formerly belonging to the Conventuals, has interesting tombs of the counts della Torre.
*&quot;San Giovanni&quot;: Dominican church begun in 1330 in Gothic style and completed in 1504 with Bramantesque influences. The façade is Gothic. The apse, from 1504, houses a Funerary Chapel of Ludovico II, work by Antoine Le Moiturier (1425–74) covered with green stone and characterized by an elegant play of arches and sculptures. The sepulchre of Ludovico II is a Renaissance work by Benedetto Briosco. Annexed are the Gothic cloister and the Capitular Hall with the Mausoleum of a vicar-general of the marquisate, Galeazzo Cavassa di Carmagnola, a Renaissance work by Matteo Sanmicheli.
*Casa Cavassa: site of the civic museum and rebuilt with a Renaissance interior.
*&quot;San Agostino&quot; and &quot;San Bernardino&quot;
*&quot;Town Hall&quot; is the former Jesuit College, while the older one (1462), with a bold tower, is utilized by the Court of Assizes. The 16th century &quot;Villa Belvedere&quot; has elegant rooms with late-Renaissance decorations.

<doc id="1122849" wikidata="Q1442715" url="?curid=1122849" title="MV SuperFerry 14">
<text>MV &quot;SuperFerry 14&quot; was a Philippine registered roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ferry that was attacked on February 27, 2004 by terrorist group Abu Sayyaf that resulted in the destruction of the ferry and the deaths of 116 people in the Philippines&#x27; deadliest terrorist attack. Six children less than five years old, and nine children between six and 16 years of age were among the dead or missing, including six students on a championship team sent by schools in northern Mindanao to compete in a journalism contest.

==Background==
MV &quot;SuperFerry 14&quot; was built by Hayashikane Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Ltd. in Shimonoseki, Japan in February 1981 as the &quot;White Sanpo 2&quot; () for the Japanese company Sanpo Kaiun K.K. () and was transferred to Ehime Hanshin Ferry () in 1997. She had three passenger decks and a single car deck which was accessible by ramps at the bow and the stern, a common feature of a RoPax Ferry. She had extensive passenger facilities and had a luxurious interior. She featured a twin &quot;QE2&quot; inspired funnel. She was painted with a giant phoenix on the side of the hull.

She was 155.6 meters long, 23.6 meters wide, and had a depth of 13.0 meters. She had a gross tonnage of 10,181.77. She was eventually sold to WG&amp;A in the year 2000 where she was renamed the MV &quot;SuperFerry 14&quot;. At the time of her service in the Philippines, her interior was more opulent than what is normally found in a domestic ferry. WG&amp;A marketed her differently to distinguish herself from other ferries in her class.

==Bombing==
On the night of February 26, the 10,192-ton ferry sailed out of Manila for Cagayan de Oro via Bacolod and Iloilo City with 899 recorded passengers and crew aboard. A television set containing a TNT bomb had been placed on board in the lower, more-crowded decks.

An hour after at 11 p.m. sailing just off either El Fraile or Corregidor Island an explosion tore through the vessel, starting a fire that engulfed the ship. Captain Ceferino Manzo issued the order to abandon ship at about 1:30 a.m., February 27. As the fire spread across the vessel most of the survivors jumped into the sea or boarded rescue boats. By February 29, officials had accounted for 565 of the 744 recorded passengers and all but two of the 155 crew members.

In the days following the blast, the recovery of the dead and missing, calculated at around 180 on February 29, was slow. Officials stated the missing may have been trapped inside the blazing ferry, have drowned in Manila Bay and that others may have been picked up by fishing boats. The recovery of bodies took several months, with only four bodies recovered by Coast Guard divers from the half-submerged ferry in the first week, despite it having been towed to shallower waters near Mariveles town, west of Manila. At least another 12 bodies, some displaying blast injuries, were recovered by divers in the days up until the 7th. Eventually, 63 bodies were recovered while another 53 remained missing, presumed dead.

==Investigation==
Despite claims from various terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident, caused by a gas explosion. Sabotage was initially ruled out.

However, at the marine board of inquiry hearing in late March 2004, a safety supervisor with the ship&#x27;s owner, WG&amp;A, testified that about 150 survivors told him an explosion took place in the tourist section around the general area of bunk 51. The Captain of the ferry, Ceferino Manzo, testified in the same hearing that the entire tourist section was engulfed in &quot;thick black smoke that smelled like gunpowder.&quot;

After divers righted the ferry, five months after it sank, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man named Redondo Cain Dellosa, a Rajah Sulaiman Movement member, confessed to planting a bomb, triggered by a timing device, on board for the Abu Sayyaf group. He held a ticket on the ferry for bunk 51B, where the bomb was placed, and disembarked before the ship&#x27;s departure.

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced on October 11, 2004, that investigators had concluded that the explosion had been caused by a bomb. She said six suspects had been arrested in connection with the bombing and that the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were still at large. It was believed that Abu Sayyaf bombed &quot;Superferry 14&quot; because the company that owned it, WG&amp;A, did not comply with a letter demanding $1 million in protection money. The vessel was later raised and sold for scrap.

==Arrest and deportation==
Ruben Omar Pestano Lavilla, Jr., a listed terrorist of U.S. State Department, and founder of Philippine terror group Rajah Sulaiman Movement, was arrested in Bahrain on July 24, 2008. Anti-Terrorism Council Chairman Eduardo Ermita announced that Lavilla, the alleged mastermind of the Superferry 14 bombing, was deported from Bahrain to the Philippines on August 30. Included in the sanctioned list of the United Nations Security Council, the RSM leader was also implicated in the February 14, 2005 bombings at Glorietta, and has pending murder case before the Makati Regional Trial Court for the bombings.

<text>The 1983 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jacarepaguá on 13 March 1983. It was the first round of the 1983 Formula One season.

== Qualifying ==
Andrea de Cesaris in the first race for the new Alfa Romeo 890T V8 turbo engine, was excluded after failing to stop for a weight check during Saturday qualifying.

Keke Rosberg&#x27;s pole position was the last for the Cosworth DFV engine, and the last for a car with a naturally aspirated engine until turbos were banned in . It was also the last pole position for Cosworth until .

==Race==
The race marked the debut in the Formula One World Championship debut for American driver and future Indianapolis 500 winner Danny Sullivan, Italian driver Corrado Fabi, motorcycle road racing World Champion Johnny Cecotto, British constructor RAM.

Elio de Angelis qualified for the race in his Renault turbo-powered Lotus 93T, but switched to the team&#x27;s spare car, a Cosworth DFV-powered Lotus 92, when the Renault unit failed on the warm-up lap. This was deemed illegal and so he was disqualified.

Rosberg was disqualified for a push start in the pits, after his car momentarily caught fire during refueling. It was the second consecutive Brazilian Grand Prix in which Rosberg was disqualified from second place. For reasons unknown, FISA did not promote the drivers who finished behind Rosberg, so the six points for second place were officially not awarded.

<text>The 1983 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Paul Ricard on 17 April 1983.

French driver Alain Prost won the race for the Renault team, and this was the French marque&#x27;s 3rd French Grand Prix win in a row and the 4th in 5 seasons. Second was the Brabham-BMW of World Champion Nelson Piquet, with Prost&#x27;s Renault teammate Eddie Cheever finishing third. Rounding out the points finishers were Patrick Tambay in his Ferrari, and the non-turbo Williamses of Keke Rosberg and Jacques Laffite. This was the final time that both Renault cars started on the front row until the 2003 Malaysian Grand Prix, when young Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jarno Trulli started on the front row.

==Summary==
===Qualifying===
On home soil, Renault dominated the French Grand Prix. Alain Prost took pole position 2.3 seconds faster than second placed teammate Eddie Cheever. It would be Cheever&#x27;s best ever qualifying position in Formula One. On the fast Circuit Paul Ricard with its 1.8 km long Mistral Straight, the turbo engines with their greater power had a large advantage. The fastest normally-aspirated car was the 12th placed McLaren-Ford of Long Beach runner up Niki Lauda, qualifying some 4.3 seconds slower than pole-sitter Prost. After occupying the front row of the grid at Long Beach, Ferrari had difficulty with René Arnoux qualifying 4th and Tambay faring worse, only qualifying 11th.

Chico Serra returned to the grid in the No.30 Arrows-Ford after Australia&#x27;s World Champion Alan Jones had failed to come up with the required sponsorship money to keep the seat. Serra, who qualified 26th in France, would only last this and the next two races in Imola and Monaco before Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver replaced him for good with Belgian rookie Thierry Boutsen (who had finished 2nd and 3rd respectively in the 1981 and 1982 European Formula Two Championships) at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Failing to qualify for the race were the RAM-Fords of Eliseo Salazar and debutante Jean-Louis Schlesser, and the Osella of Piercarlo Ghinzani.

===Race===
As he had done in qualifying, Prost dominated the race for his first win in over 12 months, only losing the lead during the mid-race pit stops. Piquet finished second in the Brabham-BMW while Eddie Cheever finished 3rd in his Renault. Tambay managed to salvage what had been a tough weekend by finishing 4th with the Williams pair of Rosberg and Laffite finishing a lap down in 5th and 6th respectively.

Before the race, Lotus driver Nigel Mansell had his toes accidentally run over by his own team pushing his car in the pits which caused him to need a pain killing injection. He started the race but retired after just 6 laps when the pain of pushing the pedals became unbearable. Long Beach winner John Watson was the races first retirement on lap 3 with engine failure in his McLaren.

<text>The 1983 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 1 May 1983. It was the fourth race of the 1983 FIA Formula One World Championship.

Patrick Tambay took a popular victory in his Ferrari in front of a delighted &quot;Tifosi&quot;. Driving the #27 car, Tambay dedicated his win to the man he had replaced in the Ferrari team, the late Gilles Villeneuve. It was almost a perfect weekend for the Maranello-based team with René Arnoux qualifying on pole and finishing third. Renault&#x27;s Alain Prost finished in second place, passing Arnoux with three laps left after the #28 Ferrari spun at the Acque Minerali chicane.

Brabham driver Riccardo Patrese had taken the lead from Tambay with six laps remaining, but only held the lead for half a lap before crashing at Acque Minerali. He later described the accident as &quot;purely my mistake&quot;. Showing their love for Ferrari more than for an Italian driver in a non-Italian car, the &quot;Tifosi&quot; cheered as Patrese handed the lead back to Frenchman Tambay in his Ferrari to take his second and last F1 victory.

This would be the last time that Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari saw his Formula One team score a victory in person. Enzo never attended races outside Italy at the time, and Ferrari would not win on Italian soil again until after Enzo died in 1988. Ferrari would not win at Imola again until Michael Schumacher in 1999. As of 2024, this remains the last race where all three drivers on the podium were of the same nationality.

<doc id="1122854" wikidata="Q857809" url="?curid=1122854" title="Equilibrium constant">
<text>The equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction is the value of its reaction quotient at chemical equilibrium, a state approached by a dynamic chemical system after sufficient time has elapsed at which its composition has no measurable tendency towards further change. For a given set of reaction conditions, the equilibrium constant is independent of the initial analytical concentrations of the reactant and product species in the mixture. Thus, given the initial composition of a system, known equilibrium constant values can be used to determine the composition of the system at equilibrium. However, reaction parameters like temperature, solvent, and ionic strength may all influence the value of the equilibrium constant.

A knowledge of equilibrium constants is essential for the understanding of many chemical systems, as well as the biochemical processes such as oxygen transport by hemoglobin in blood and acid–base homeostasis in the human body.

Stability constants, formation constants, binding constants, association constants and dissociation constants are all types of equilibrium constants.

== Basic definitions and properties ==
For a system undergoing a reversible reaction described by the general chemical equation
: formula_1
a thermodynamic equilibrium constant, denoted by formula_2, is defined to be the value of the reaction quotient &quot;Qt&quot; when forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. At chemical equilibrium, the chemical composition of the mixture does not change with time, and the Gibbs free energy change formula_3 for the reaction is zero. If the composition of a mixture at equilibrium is changed by addition of some reagent, a new equilibrium position will be reached, given enough time. An equilibrium constant is related to the composition of the mixture at equilibrium by
: formula_4
: formula_5

where {X} denotes the thermodynamic activity of reagent X at equilibrium, [X] the numerical value of the corresponding concentration in moles per liter, and γ the corresponding activity coefficient. If X is a gas, instead of [X] the numerical value of the partial pressure formula_6 in bar is used. If it can be assumed that the quotient of activity coefficients, formula_7, is constant over a range of experimental conditions, such as pH, then an equilibrium constant can be derived as a quotient of concentrations.
: formula_8

An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction formula_9 by 
: formula_10
where &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature (in kelvins), and is the natural logarithm. This expression implies that formula_2 must be a pure number and cannot have a dimension, since logarithms can only be taken of pure numbers. formula_12 must also be a pure number. On the other hand, the reaction quotient at equilibrium

: formula_13
does have the dimension of concentration raised to some power (see , below). Such reaction quotients are often referred to, in the biochemical literature, as equilibrium constants.

For an equilibrium mixture of gases, an equilibrium constant can be defined in terms of partial pressure or fugacity.

An equilibrium constant is related to the forward and backward rate constants, &quot;k&quot;f and &quot;k&quot;r of the reactions involved in reaching equilibrium:

: formula_14

A cumulative or overall constant, given the symbol &quot;β&quot;, is the constant for the formation of a complex from reagents. For example, the cumulative constant for the formation of ML2 is given by
:M + 2 L ML2; [ML2] = &quot;β&quot;12[M][L]2
The stepwise constant, &quot;K&quot;, for the formation of the same complex from ML and L is given by
:ML + L ML2; [ML2] = &quot;K&quot;[ML][L] = &quot;Kβ&quot;11[M][L]2
It follows that
:&quot;β&quot;12 = &quot;Kβ&quot;11
A cumulative constant can always be expressed as the product of stepwise constants. There is no agreed notation for stepwise constants, though a symbol such as &quot;K&quot; is sometimes found in the literature. It is best always to define each stability constant by reference to an equilibrium expression.

==== Competition method ====
A particular use of a stepwise constant is in the determination of stability constant values outside the normal range for a given method. For example, EDTA complexes of many metals are outside the range for the potentiometric method. The stability constants for those complexes were determined by competition with a weaker ligand.
:ML + L′ ML′ + L formula_15
The formation constant of [Pd(CN)4]2− was determined by the competition method.

=== Association and dissociation constants ===
In organic chemistry and biochemistry it is customary to use p&quot;K&quot;a values for acid dissociation equilibria.
:formula_16
where &quot;log&quot; denotes a logarithm to base 10 or common logarithm, and &quot;K&quot;diss is a stepwise acid dissociation constant. For bases, the base association constant, p&quot;K&quot;b is used. For any given acid or base the two constants are related by , so p&quot;K&quot;a can always be used in calculations.

On the other hand, stability constants for metal complexes, and binding constants for host–guest complexes are generally expressed as association constants. When considering equilibria such as
:M + HL ML + H
it is customary to use association constants for both ML and HL. Also, in generalized computer programs dealing with equilibrium constants it is general practice to use cumulative constants rather than stepwise constants and to omit ionic charges from equilibrium expressions. For example, if NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid, N(CH2CO2H)3 is designated as H3L and forms complexes ML and MHL with a metal ion M, the following expressions would apply for the dissociation constants.
:formula_17
The cumulative association constants can be expressed as
:formula_18

== Thermodynamic basis for equilibrium constant expressions ==
Thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized by the free energy for the whole (closed) system being a minimum. For systems at constant temperature and pressure the Gibbs free energy is minimum. The slope of the reaction free energy with respect to the extent of reaction, &quot;ξ&quot;, is zero when the free energy is at its minimum value. 
:formula_19

The free energy change, d&quot;G&quot;r, can be expressed as a weighted sum of change in amount times the chemical potential, the partial molar free energy of the species. The chemical potential, &quot;μi&quot;, of the &quot;i&quot;th species in a chemical reaction is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the number of moles of that species, &quot;N&quot;i
:formula_20

A general chemical equilibrium can be written as

:formula_21 

where &quot;nj&quot; are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in the equilibrium equation, and &quot;mj&quot; are the coefficients of the products. At equilibrium
:formula_22

The chemical potential, &quot;μi&quot;, of the &quot;i&quot;th species can be calculated in terms of its activity, &quot;ai&quot;.
:formula_23
&quot;μ&quot; is the standard chemical potential of the species, &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature. Setting the sum for the reactants &quot;j&quot; to be equal to the sum for the products, &quot;k&quot;, so that &quot;δG&quot;r(Eq) = 0
:formula_24
Rearranging the terms,
:formula_25
:formula_26
This relates the standard Gibbs free energy change, Δ&quot;G&quot;o to an equilibrium constant, &quot;K&quot;, the reaction quotient of activity values at equilibrium.
:formula_27
:formula_28

===Equivalence of thermodynamic and kinetic expressions for equilibrium constants===
At equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the backward reaction rate. A simple reaction, such as ester hydrolysis
:&lt;chem&gt;AB + H2O &lt;=&gt; AH + B(OH)&lt;/chem&gt;
has reaction rates given by expressions
:formula_29
:formula_30
According to Guldberg and Waage, equilibrium is attained when the forward and backward reaction rates are equal to each other. In these circumstances, an equilibrium constant is defined to be equal to the ratio of the forward and backward reaction rate constants 
:formula_31.
The concentration of water may be taken to be constant, resulting in the simpler expression 
:formula_32.
This particular concentration quotient, formula_33, has the dimension of concentration, but the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, , is always dimensionless.

== Unknown activity coefficient values ==

It is very rare for activity coefficient values to have been determined experimentally for a system at equilibrium. There are three options for dealing with the situation where activity coefficient values are not known from experimental measurements.
#Use calculated activity coefficients, together with concentrations of reactants. For equilibria in solution estimates of the activity coefficients of charged species can be obtained using Debye–Hückel theory, an extended version, or SIT theory. For uncharged species, the activity coefficient &quot;γ&quot;0 mostly follows a &quot;salting-out&quot; model: log10 &quot;γ&quot;0 = &quot;bI&quot; where &quot;I&quot; stands for ionic strength.
#Assume that the activity coefficients are all equal to 1. This is acceptable when all concentrations are very low.
#For equilibria in solution use a medium of high ionic strength. In effect this redefines the standard state as referring to the medium. Activity coefficients in the standard state are, by definition, equal to 1. The value of an equilibrium constant determined in this manner is dependent on the ionic strength. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.

== Dimensionality ==
An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction change, formula_34, for the reaction by the expression
:formula_35
Therefore, &quot;K&quot;, must be a dimensionless number from which a logarithm can be derived. In the case of a simple equilibrium
:&lt;chem&gt;A + B &lt;=&gt; AB, &lt;/chem&gt;
the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is defined in terms of the activities, {AB}, {A} and {B}, of the species in equilibrium with each other:
:formula_36
Now, each activity term can be expressed as a product of a concentration formula_37 and a corresponding activity coefficient, formula_38. Therefore,
:formula_39
When formula_7, the quotient of activity coefficients, is set equal to 1, we get 
:formula_41
&quot;K&quot; then appears to have the dimension of 1/concentration. This is what usually happens in practice when an equilibrium constant is calculated as a quotient of concentration values. This can be avoided by dividing each concentration by its standard-state value (usually mol/L or bar), which is standard practice in chemistry.

The assumption underlying this practice is that the quotient of activities is constant under the conditions in which the equilibrium constant value is determined. These conditions are usually achieved by keeping the reaction temperature constant and by using a medium of relatively high ionic strength as the solvent. It is not unusual, particularly in texts relating to biochemical equilibria, to see an equilibrium constant value quoted with a dimension. The justification for this practice is that the concentration scale used may be either mol dm−3 or mmol dm−3, so that the concentration unit has to be stated in order to avoid there being any ambiguity.

&quot;Note&quot;. When the concentration values are measured on the mole fraction scale all concentrations and activity coefficients are dimensionless quantities.

In general equilibria between two reagents can be expressed as
:&lt;chem&gt;{\mathit{p}A} + \mathit{q}B &lt;=&gt; A_\mathit{p}B_\mathit{q} , &lt;/chem&gt;
in which case the equilibrium constant is defined, in terms of numerical concentration values, as
:formula_42
The apparent dimension of this &quot;K&quot; value is concentration1−p−q; this may be written as M(1−p−q) or mM(1−p−q), where the symbol M signifies a molar concentration (). The apparent dimension of a dissociation constant is the reciprocal of the apparent dimension of the corresponding association constant, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

When discussing the thermodynamics of chemical equilibria it is necessary to take dimensionality into account. There are two possible approaches.
# Set the dimension of to be the reciprocal of the dimension of the concentration quotient. This is almost universal practice in the field of stability constant determinations. The &quot;equilibrium constant&quot; formula_43, is dimensionless. It will be a function of the ionic strength of the medium used for the determination. Setting the numerical value of to be 1 is equivalent to re-defining the standard states. 
# Replace each concentration term formula_37 by the dimensionless quotient formula_45, where formula_46 is the concentration of reagent in its standard state (usually 1 mol/L or 1 bar). By definition the numerical value of formula_47 is 1, so also has a numerical value of 1. 
In both approaches the numerical value of the stability constant is unchanged. The first is more useful for practical purposes; in fact, the unit of the concentration quotient is often attached to a published stability constant value in the biochemical literature. The second approach is consistent with the standard exposition of Debye–Hückel theory, where formula_48, &quot;etc&quot;. are taken to be pure numbers.

==Water as both reactant and solvent==
For reactions in aqueous solution, such as an acid dissociation reaction 
:AH + H2O A− + H3O+ 
the concentration of water may be taken as being constant and the formation of the hydronium ion is implicit. 
:AH A− + H+
Water concentration is omitted from expressions defining equilibrium constants, except when solutions are very concentrated.
:formula_49 (&quot;K&quot; defined as a dissociation constant)
Similar considerations apply to metal ion hydrolysis reactions.

== Enthalpy and entropy: temperature dependence ==
If both the equilibrium constant, formula_50 and the standard enthalpy change, formula_51, for a reaction have been determined experimentally, the standard entropy change for the reaction is easily derived. Since formula_52 and formula_53
:formula_54
To a first approximation the standard enthalpy change is independent of temperature. Using this approximation, definite integration of the van &#x27;t Hoff equation 
:formula_55
gives

:formula_56
This equation can be used to calculate the value of log K at a temperature, T2, knowing the value at temperature T1.

The van &#x27;t Hoff equation also shows that, for an exothermic reaction (formula_57), when temperature increases &quot;K&quot; decreases and when temperature decreases &quot;K&quot; increases, in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle. The reverse applies when the reaction is endothermic.

When &quot;K&quot; has been determined at more than two temperatures, a straight line fitting procedure may be applied to a plot of formula_58 against formula_59 to obtain a value for formula_60. Error propagation theory can be used to show that, with this procedure, the error on the calculated formula_60 value is much greater than the error on individual log K values. Consequently, K needs to be determined to high precision when using this method. For example, with a silver ion-selective electrode each log K value was determined with a precision of ca. 0.001 and the method was applied successfully.

Standard thermodynamic arguments can be used to show that, more generally, enthalpy will change with temperature.
:formula_62

where &quot;C&quot;&quot;p&quot; is the heat capacity at constant pressure.

=== A more complex formulation ===
The calculation of &quot;K&quot; at a particular temperature from a known &quot;K&quot; at another given temperature can be approached as follows if standard thermodynamic properties are available. The effect of temperature on equilibrium constant is equivalent to the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy because:

:formula_63

where Δr&quot;G&quot;o is the reaction standard Gibbs energy, which is the sum of the standard Gibbs energies of the reaction products minus the sum of standard Gibbs energies of reactants.

Here, the term &quot;standard&quot; denotes the ideal behaviour (i.e., an infinite dilution) and a hypothetical standard concentration (typically 1 mol/kg). It does not imply any particular temperature or pressure because, although contrary to IUPAC recommendation, it is more convenient when describing aqueous systems over wide temperature and pressure ranges.

The standard Gibbs energy (for each species or for the entire reaction) can be represented (from the basic definitions) as:

:formula_64

In the above equation, the effect of temperature on Gibbs energy (and thus on the equilibrium constant) is ascribed entirely to heat capacity. To evaluate the integrals in this equation, the form of the dependence of heat capacity on temperature needs to be known.

If the standard molar heat capacity &quot;C&quot; can be approximated by some analytic function of temperature (e.g. the Shomate equation), then the integrals involved in calculating other parameters may be solved to yield analytic expressions for them. For example, using approximations of the following forms:
*For pure substances (solids, gas, liquid): formula_65
*For ionic species at : formula_66

then the integrals can be evaluated and the following final form is obtained:

:formula_67

The constants &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and the absolute entropy, &quot;S̆&quot;, required for evaluation of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), as well as the values of &quot;G&quot;298 K and &quot;S&quot;298 K for many species are tabulated in the literature.

== Pressure dependence ==
The pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is usually weak in the range of pressures normally encountered in industry, and therefore, it is usually neglected in practice. This is true for condensed reactant/products (i.e., when reactants and products are solids or liquid) as well as gaseous ones.

For a gaseous-reaction example, one may consider the well-studied reaction of hydrogen with nitrogen to produce ammonia:
:N2 + 3 H2 2 NH3
If the pressure is increased by the addition of an inert gas, then neither the composition at equilibrium nor the equilibrium constant are appreciably affected (because the partial pressures remain constant, assuming an ideal-gas behaviour of all gases involved). However, the composition at equilibrium will depend appreciably on pressure when:
* the pressure is changed by compression or expansion of the gaseous reacting system, and
* the reaction results in the change of the number of moles of gas in the system.

In the example reaction above, the number of moles changes from 4 to 2, and an increase of pressure by system compression will result in appreciably more ammonia in the equilibrium mixture. In the general case of a gaseous reaction:

:&quot;α&quot; A + &quot;β&quot; B &quot;σ&quot; S + &quot;τ&quot; T

the change of mixture composition with pressure can be quantified using:

:formula_68

where &quot;p&quot; denote the partial pressures and &quot;X&quot; the mole fractions of the components, &quot;P&quot; is the total system pressure, &quot;Kp&quot; is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures and &quot;KX&quot; is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of mole fractions.

The above change in composition is in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle and does not involve any change of the equilibrium constant with the total system pressure. Indeed, for ideal-gas reactions &quot;Kp&quot; is independent of pressure.

In a condensed phase, the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant is associated with the reaction volume. For reaction:

:&quot;α&quot; A + &quot;β&quot; B &quot;σ&quot; S + &quot;τ&quot; T

the reaction volume is:

:formula_69

where &quot;V̄&quot; denotes a partial molar volume of a reactant or a product.

For the above reaction, one can expect the change of the reaction equilibrium constant (based either on mole-fraction or molal-concentration scale) with pressure at constant temperature to be:

:formula_70

The matter is complicated as partial molar volume is itself dependent on pressure.

==Effect of isotopic substitution==
Isotopic substitution can lead to changes in the values of equilibrium constants, especially if hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (or tritium). This &quot;equilibrium isotope effect&quot; is analogous to the kinetic isotope effect on rate constants, and is primarily due to the change in zero-point vibrational energy of H–X bonds due to the change in mass upon isotopic substitution. The zero-point energy is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the vibrating hydrogen atom, and will therefore be smaller for a D–X bond that for an H–X bond.

An example is a hydrogen atom abstraction reaction R&#x27; + H–R R&#x27;–H + R with equilibrium constant KH, where R&#x27; and R are organic radicals such that R&#x27; forms a stronger bond to hydrogen than does R. The decrease in zero-point energy due to deuterium substitution will then be more important for R&#x27;–H than for R–H, and R&#x27;–D will be stabilized more than R–D, so that the equilibrium constant KD for R&#x27; + D–R R&#x27;–D + R is greater than KH. This is summarized in the rule &quot;the heavier atom favors the stronger bond&quot;.

Similar effects occur in solution for acid dissociation constants (Ka) which describe the transfer of H+ or D+ from a weak aqueous acid to a solvent molecule: HA + H2O = H3O+ + A− or DA + D2O D3O+ + A−. The deuterated acid is studied in heavy water, since if it were dissolved in ordinary water the deuterium would rapidly exchange with hydrogen in the solvent.

The product species H3O+ (or D3O+) is a stronger acid than the solute acid, so that it dissociates more easily, and its H–O (or D–O) bond is weaker than the H–A (or D–A) bond of the solute acid. The decrease in zero-point energy due to isotopic substitution is therefore less important in D3O+ than in DA so that KD &lt; KH, and the deuterated acid in D2O is weaker than the non-deuterated acid in H2O. In many cases the difference of logarithmic constants pKD – pKH is about 0.6, so that the pD corresponding to 50% dissociation of the deuterated acid is about 0.6 units higher than the pH for 50% dissociation of the non-deuterated acid.

For similar reasons the self-ionization of heavy water is less than that of ordinary water at the same temperature.

<text>The 1983 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 15 May 1983. It was the fifth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship. The 76-lap race was won by Finnish driver Keke Rosberg, driving a Williams-Ford (the last victory of Williams in Monaco until 2003 with Juan Pablo Montoya), with Brazilian Nelson Piquet second in a Brabham-BMW and Frenchman Alain Prost third in a Renault. This was only time that both works McLaren cars failed to qualify for a race. 

Thirty years later, Rosberg&#x27;s son Nico won the 2013 race, making them the first father and son to win in the principality.

<text>The 1983 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 22 May 1983. It was the first Belgian Grand Prix to be held at Spa since 1970 and the first on the modern Spa circuit, and was also the sixth race of the 1983 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 40-lap race was won from pole position by Alain Prost, driving a factory Renault. Patrick Tambay finished second in a Ferrari, with Eddie Cheever third in the other Renault. The race marked the debut of local driver and future race winner Thierry Boutsen.

The first attempt to start the race was waved off. The field drove around the circuit and lined up again for the second attempt, which was successful.

== Report ==

=== Race report ===
Andrea de Cesaris jumped from third to first at the start, overtaking Alain Prost and Patrick Tambay, and de Cesaris began to build up a lead on Prost who faced pressure from the Ferraris behind him. After initially challenging Tambay for the last podium place, Rene Arnoux began to fall back and was caught by Nelson Piquet with Keke Rosberg following a short distance back in 6th. Piquet got a good exit out of La Source, and powered down the hill to overtake Arnoux before Eau Rouge, leaving him in the attention of the non-turbo powered Williams cars who don&#x27;t get a chance to pass before Arnoux&#x27;s turbo failed, putting an end to his race a few laps later. De Cesaris pitted from the lead, but it was a slow stop, over 25 seconds, and the second stint got going with Prost leading by almost 10 seconds. Prost&#x27;s mechanics did a 14.4 second stop in an era when the record was around 13&quot;.&quot;

Meanwhile Piquet and Tambay switched positions after their stops. Piquet&#x27;s pit crew managing a 15.2 second stop, refueling included, for an overcut. De Cesaris&#x27;s sluggish pit stop would come to be the prologue for his retirement when injection problems made him pull up on the side of the road on lap 25. Piquet inherited second place, with Tambay close on his trails, less than 3 seconds behind. Eddie Cheever who climbed his way from 8th emerged behind them eager to attack the podium positions. The last two points places were with the underpowered Williams cars who were running a lonely and quiet race at significant distance from each other and also from the rest of the field. In the latter stages Piquet lost 5th (highest) gear and went dramatically slower on the straights as his Brabham could not reach top speed. Tambay and Cheever swiftly profited from this, dropping the 1981 champion to fourth. From here on the first six places remain unchanged. Prost won and built a 4 point lead over Piquet in the championship.

<text>The 1983 British Grand Prix (formally the XXXVI Marlboro British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 16 July 1983. It was the ninth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship.

The 67-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a factory Renault, after he started from third position. Nelson Piquet finished second in a Brabham-BMW, with Patrick Tambay third in a Ferrari. The win, Prost&#x27;s third of the season, enabled him to extend his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to six points.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
The front row of the grid was filled by the Ferraris of René Arnoux and Patrick Tambay, Arnoux over 0.6 seconds ahead. Arnoux created history with his lap as he was the first driver ever to lap Silverstone in under 70 seconds. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Alain Prost was third in his Renault, with Elio de Angelis in the Lotus alongside him on the second row. The two Brabhams made up the third row with Riccardo Patrese ahead of Nelson Piquet, while on the fourth row were Eddie Cheever in the second Renault and Manfred Winkelhock in the ATS. Completing the top ten were Andrea de Cesaris in the Alfa Romeo and Derek Warwick in the Toleman. Further down the grid, the Spirit team with its Honda turbo engine made an impressive debut as Stefan Johansson qualified 14th, ahead of both McLarens and just one place behind reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in the Williams.

Reigning World Champion Rosberg, the fastest of the non-turbos, was some 4.293 seconds slower than Arnoux. Soon to be local hero Nigel Mansell, having his first Grand Prix in the Lotus Renault, qualified 18th after a troubled practice in sorting the new car. Mansell had raced in the non-championship 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in the turbo powered Lotus 93T earlier in the season, but until Silverstone his only Grands Prix were in the Ford powered cars.

===Race report===
In the race morning warmup, Elio de Angelis showed he and his Lotus-Renault turbo would be one to watch, posting the fastest time of the session. At the start of the race, Tambay moved ahead of Arnoux, while de Angelis quickly went from hero to zero, retiring on just the second lap with turbo failure heading into Becketts. The somewhat angry Italian pulled off onto the infield, threw his belts off, got out of his car and stalked back to the Lotus pits. While they would ultimately win through Prost plus would gain 4th place with Nigel Mansell&#x27;s stirring drive in his first GP in the Lotus-Renault in front of the home crowd, early on things were turning a bit sour for Renault. First de Angelis was out, then the second factory car of Cheever retired when his engine failed on lap 4. Then Stefan Johansson joined the growing list of retirements on lap 6 with fuel system problems in the Spirit-Honda. When Patrese&#x27;s turbo gave up on lap 10, Piquet moved up to fourth behind the Ferraris and Prost, with de Cesaris fifth and Winkelhock sixth. Prost overtook Arnoux on lap 14, followed by Piquet five laps later. Then, on lap 20, Prost passed Tambay for the lead, with Piquet moving into second on lap 31. In the later stages of the race, Winkelhock&#x27;s engine failed and de Cesaris dropped behind teammate Mauro Baldi, while Mansell, who had qualified a lowly 18th in the second Lotus (the slowest turbo qualifier), made a charge through the field that would become his signature over the coming years, finally passing Arnoux for fourth on lap 48. At the chequered flag, Prost was 19 seconds ahead of Piquet with Tambay, Mansell, Arnoux and Niki Lauda completing the top six. One lap down on Prost, Lauda was the only Cosworth powered car to finish in the points on a track which clearly suited the more powerful turbos.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Prost doubled his lead over Piquet to six points, with Tambay two points further back. Renault moved into the outright lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship, three points ahead of Ferrari.

<text>The 1983 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 7 August 1983. It was the tenth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won by French driver René Arnoux, driving a Ferrari, after he started from second position. Teammate and compatriot Patrick Tambay took pole position, but retired on lap 12 with an engine failure. Italian Andrea de Cesaris finished second in an Alfa Romeo, with another Italian, Riccardo Patrese, third in a Brabham-BMW.

Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Frenchman Alain Prost, could only manage fourth in his Renault, but nonetheless extended his lead in the championship to nine points over Brazilian Nelson Piquet, who failed to score in the other Brabham-BMW. With his second win in three races, Arnoux moved up to fourth in the championship, five points behind Piquet and three behind Tambay in third.

Niki Lauda was disqualified from fifth for reversing his McLaren-Ford in the pits.

<text>The 1983 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Österreichring on 14 August 1983. It was the eleventh race of the 1983 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a factory Renault, with Drivers&#x27; Championship rivals René Arnoux and Nelson Piquet second and third in a Ferrari and a Brabham-BMW respectively. With the win, Prost extended his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 14 points with four races remaining. However, this would turn out to be the final victory for the original factory Renault team.

<text>The 1983 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on 28 August 1983. It was the twelfth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship.

The 72-lap race was won by René Arnoux, driving a Ferrari, with team-mate Patrick Tambay second and John Watson third in a McLaren-Ford. Alain Prost and Nelson Piquet collided midway through the race while challenging for the lead, allowing Arnoux to move into second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, eight points behind Prost. However, this would turn out to be Arnoux&#x27;s last Formula One victory.

Derek Warwick finished fourth to score his and the Toleman team&#x27;s first points. Mauro Baldi in the Alfa Romeo and Michele Alboreto in the Tyrrell completed the top six.

The race saw McLaren debut the new Porsche-built TAG turbo engine. Niki Lauda drove the TAG-powered MP4/1E car, while Watson continued with the Ford-powered McLaren. However, Lauda could only qualify 19th, four places behind Watson, and retired on lap 26 with a brake failure. Watson&#x27;s third place was the last time a car with a naturally aspirated engine would legally finish on a Formula One podium until the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1983 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 11 September 1983. It was the thirteenth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship.

The 52-lap race was won by Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-BMW, with René Arnoux second in a Ferrari and Eddie Cheever third in a Renault. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Alain Prost retired with a turbo failure midway through the race, allowing Piquet and Arnoux to close to within five and two points of him respectively in the championship.

The race saw the occurrence of an unusual incident in the pit lane. After completing a pit stop, Niki Lauda&#x27;s McLaren-TAG stalled in front of the Brabham garage. The Brabham crew, who were preparing for Nelson Piquet&#x27;s stop, were joined by team owner and FOCA chief executive Bernie Ecclestone in giving Lauda a push start, to get him back into the race and to clear the area for Piquet. However, the Austrian driver retired shortly after with an electrical failure.

Another incident occurred at the end of the race, when the &quot;tifosi&quot; ran onto the track to celebrate Arnoux&#x27;s second place with the cars still going round. Nigel Mansell, running seventh in his Lotus-Renault, slowed down to avoid running over any of the spectators, only to be overtaken by Bruno Giacomelli&#x27;s Toleman-Hart. Infuriated, Mansell drove the wrong way into the pit lane.

<text>The 1983 European Grand Prix (formally the John Player Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch on 25 September 1983. It was the fourteenth race of the 1983 Formula One World Championship.

The 76-lap race was won by Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-BMW. Piquet&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival Alain Prost was second in a factory Renault, while Nigel Mansell was third in a Lotus-Renault. With the win, Piquet moved within two points of Prost at the top of the championship with one race remaining.

==Background==
A third Grand Prix in the United States (after the earlier races at Long Beach and Detroit) was to have been held on this date, on a track at the Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, but was cancelled at short notice due to local protests. A second race in the United Kingdom, at Brands Hatch, was quickly organised in its place, and was the first Formula One race to be officially titled the European Grand Prix: this title had, until 1977, been an honorific title given to one race held in Europe each year alongside its official, national title.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
Elio de Angelis surprised by taking pole position in his Lotus-Renault, with teammate Nigel Mansell third. Between them was the Brabham-BMW of Riccardo Patrese, with Nelson Piquet fourth in the other Brabham. The Ferraris filled the third row with René Arnoux ahead of Patrick Tambay, while the factory Renaults took up the fourth row, Eddie Cheever ahead of Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Alain Prost. Completing the top ten were Manfred Winkelhock in the ATS and John Watson in the McLaren.

The fastest non-turbo car was the Williams of Keke Rosberg in 16th; teammate Jacques Laffite failed to qualify. Williams had planned to debut their Honda turbo-powered FW09 at this race, but instead decided to wait until the season finale in South Africa. The team, did, however, enter a third car for test driver and Formula Two champion Jonathan Palmer, who qualified 25th.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
===Race report===
At the start, Riccardo Patrese took the lead from Elio de Angelis, followed by Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Eddie Cheever. On lap 2 Piquet passed Mansell, who was having trouble with his tyres and would soon fall to seventh, while Alain Prost made a charge to run fourth by lap 9.

Patrese and de Angelis had pulled clear of the rest of the field when, on lap 11, de Angelis attempted to overtake the Brabham at Surtees Corner, only to make contact and send both cars spinning. Piquet duly went through into the lead, while Patrese rejoined the track ahead of Prost but was soon caught and passed by the Renault. De Angelis also rejoined, but continued for only two laps before retiring with an engine failure.

At quarter distance, Piquet led Prost by around 10 seconds, with Patrese a further 10 seconds back and holding up Cheever, René Arnoux, Mansell and Patrick Tambay. On lap 20 Arnoux spun at Surtees, dropping him to the back of the field. There were no further changes among the front-runners until the pit stops, during which both Brabhams hit trouble: Patrese was delayed by a misfitted rear wheel, while Piquet was held up by a malfunctioning wheel-nut gun. Piquet nonetheless retained his lead over Prost, while an unscheduled second stop for Cheever (due to a loose helmet visor which was taped by his pit crew) left Tambay in third and Mansell fourth, with Andrea de Cesaris up to fifth in the Alfa Romeo and Derek Warwick sixth in the Toleman.

In the closing stages, Tambay suffered brake problems, allowing Mansell past on lap 66 before spinning off at Druids two laps later. This moved the second Toleman of Bruno Giacomelli into the top six, while also ending Tambay&#x27;s challenge for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Shortly afterwards, Warwick had a bizarre accident when his cockpit fire extinguisher leaked, giving him burns to his right hand and leg, though he held on to fifth place.

Up front, Piquet cruised to his second consecutive win, finishing 6.5 seconds ahead of Prost with Mansell a further 24 seconds back. De Cesaris finished four seconds behind Mansell and ten ahead of Warwick, who in turn finished eight seconds ahead of teammate Giacomelli. Patrese ultimately finished seventh, while Arnoux was ninth and Cheever tenth, both one lap down on Piquet. With one race to go, Prost still led the Drivers&#x27; Championship but by only two points over Piquet, while Arnoux&#x27;s failure to score left him needing to win in South Africa to have any chance of the title.

The race also saw the last appearance of the Theodore team, which was struggling financially and had scaled back to one car for Roberto Guerrero. Guerrero finished 12th, one place ahead of Palmer&#x27;s Williams.

<text>James Edgar Leach VC (27 July 1892 – 15 August 1958) was a British Army officer and English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Leach was 22 years old, and a Second Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, in France during the First World War. The 2nd Manchesters formed part of 5 Division, which had crossed the Béthune–La Bassée canal and then came under heavy attack. On 29 October 1914, near Festubert, the following deed took place for which Leach and Sergeant John Hogan were awarded the VC.

Their citation reads:
Leach later achieved the rank of Captain. After the war, he served in the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>The 1983 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 15 October 1983. It was the fifteenth and final race of the 1983 Formula One season. The 77 lap race was won by Riccardo Patrese driving for Brabham. This would be Patrese&#x27;s last win for nearly seven years until he won for Williams at the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix.

== Race summary ==
Before the race, three drivers were still in a position to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship: Alain Prost (Renault) led the championship with 57 points, followed by Nelson Piquet (Brabham-BMW) with 55 and René Arnoux (Ferrari) with 49. Piquet qualified second, behind Patrick Tambay (Ferrari) in pole position and ahead of Riccardo Patrese (Brabham), Arnoux and Prost in third, fourth and fifth. At the start Piquet passed Tambay to take the lead, with Patrese moving into second place. Arnoux retired with engine failure on lap 9. Prost fought his way up to third place, but he also retired on lap 35 with turbo failure. Needing only to finish fourth or higher, Piquet slowed and was overtaken by Patrese, Niki Lauda (McLaren) and Andrea de Cesaris (Alfa Romeo). Lauda&#x27;s engine failed on lap 71. The race finished with Patrese in first place, de Cesaris in second and Piquet in third, and Piquet won the championship by two points. Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship despite not finishing in the points in the last race for the second consecutive year. John Watson, completing his last full Formula One season, was disqualified for overtaking other cars on the parade lap. This was also the last F1 race for Jean-Pierre Jarier.

<text>The 1984 Brazilian Grand Prix, officially known as the XIII Grande Prêmio Brasil de Fórmula 1 was a Formula One motor race held on 25 March 1984 in Rio de Janeiro. The race was contested over 61 laps of Jacarepaguá Circuit and was the first race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship. This race was the 13th edition of the Brazilian Grand Prix, the ninth time that the Jacarepaguá Circuit race held a Grand Prix, and marked the debut of Ayrton Senna in Formula One.

In qualifying, Italian driver, Elio de Angelis from Team Lotus claimed pole for the second time in his career as he finished ahead of fellow Italian driver, Michele Alboreto who was in the Ferrari. In the race it was Alain Prost in the McLaren car who would take out his second win in Brazil. He finished ahead of Keke Rosberg who was in the Williams with de Angelis finishing in third.

==Qualifying==
Elio de Angelis claimed the first pole position of the season in his Lotus-Renault from the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto in his first race for the Prancing Horse. Derek Warwick, in his first race for Renault, was 3rd on the grid with the McLaren-TAG of Alain Prost 4th, Prost returning to the team he started his career with after three seasons with Renault. Reigning World Champion (and local favourite) Nelson Piquet qualified 7th in his Brabham-BMW, while another Brazilian, a Formula One rookie by the name of Ayrton Senna qualified 17th for his first ever Grand Prix in his Toleman-Hart.

==Race==
With only 220 litres of fuel allowed, many teams on the grid tried various ways to save fuel from evaporating in the Rio heat. McLaren covered their cars in tin foil while others such as Lotus and Renault attempted to freeze their fuel in order to actually fit more in. The Renault team also had a sophisticated (for 1984) electronic fuel monitoring system which they hoped would give them an advantage over their rivals.

Alboreto got the jump at the start and led early from Warwick and de Angelis, with the McLarens of Niki Lauda 4th and Prost fighting back from a bad start. The Frenchman had bogged down at the green light with too few revs and was only 10th at the end of the first lap (Piquet also made a bad start after almost stalling at the green light and much to the agony of the crowd, was only in 23rd halfway through the first lap). Not having done a practice start in the car, during the warm-up Prost had asked Lauda what revs to use at the start. Lauda told him no less than 10,000 but on the grid Prost felt this was too high and dropped to 8,000 only to find Lauda had been correct. Despite this he was beginning to show the superior race speed which would become the story of the season. Lauda quickly passed de Angelis and when he passed Warwick for 2nd at the end of the back straight on lap 10, the McLaren&#x27;s right rear hit the Renault&#x27;s left front tyre. The hit damaged Warwick&#x27;s suspension, leading to suspension failure for the Renault driver late in the race when running second.

Senna was the first retirement of the 1984 season when the Hart 415T in his Toleman blew its turbo on lap 8.

Alboreto&#x27;s race was ruined by a loose bolt in his car&#x27;s right front brake caliper which released all the brake fluid and caused the brake to overheat, resulting in a couple of spins and a pit stop where buckets of water were thrown over the brakes in a vain attempt at cooling it. Lauda was leading by some 40 seconds on lap 34 when the wires to his McLaren&#x27;s battery came loose causing electrical failure, while after almost stalling his Brabham-BMW at the start, Piquet finished an unhappy race on lap 32 when the BMW engine failed coming onto the pit straight.

After passing Warwick for the lead, Prost, who was in the pits for a tyre change when Lauda coasted in to retire, lost the lead back to the Englishman when he made his second stop for tyres. He regained the lead for good following Warwick&#x27;s retirement and ran out the winner by 40 seconds from the Williams-Honda of Keke Rosberg and the Lotus of de Angelis. For Rosberg it was his third successive second place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, though it was the only one in which he was not disqualified. Eddie Cheever finish 4th in the Alfa Romeo giving some hope that the 890T V8 would not be as thirsty for fuel as predicted, while Renault&#x27;s Patrick Tambay was classified in 6th after running out of fuel on the last lap, losing 5th to another F1 rookie, Martin Brundle in his Tyrrell-Ford.

Brundle, and the Tyrrell team, would later be disqualified from the season for technical infringements. This promoted Tambay to 5th and the Arrows-Ford of Thierry Boutsen to 6th.

<text>The 1984 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 7 April 1984. It was race 2 of 16 in the 1984 Formula One World Championship. The 75-lap race was won by Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG, with teammate Alain Prost second and Derek Warwick third in a Renault.

==Report==
===Qualifying===
Qualifying saw reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet take the first of an eventual nine pole positions for 1984 in his Brabham-BMW (which was clocked at on the circuit&#x27;s long front straight), with Keke Rosberg alongside him on the front row in his Williams-Honda. On the second row were Nigel Mansell in the Lotus and Patrick Tambay in the factory Renault, while on the third row were Alain Prost in the McLaren and Teo Fabi in the second Brabham. The top ten was completed by Elio de Angelis in the second Lotus, Niki Lauda in the second McLaren, Derek Warwick in the second Renault and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari. The Cosworth-powered Tyrrells and Arrows struggled, with Thierry Boutsen coming 27th and last in his Arrows and thus failing to qualify.

===Race===
In the Sunday morning warm-up session Piercarlo Ghinzani, who had qualified 20th in his Osella, crashed heavily at the fast left-hand Jukskei Sweep, the car bursting into flames. Ghinzani escaped with minor burns on his hands, and subsequently withdrew from the race, thus promoting Boutsen to the last grid spot.

Before the start of the race, Prost&#x27;s McLaren refused to fire up thanks to a fuel pump failure and his McLaren was pushed to the side of the road and he started from the pitlane in the spare car. In fact, Ghinzani&#x27;s accident and the subsequent 30 minutes delay before the start was extremely fortunate for Prost. During the warmup, Lauda had a chronic misfire in his TAG-Porsche race engine. It took the McLaren team until 13 minutes into the extra 30 to completely change the electrical system in Lauda&#x27;s car, which cured the low-end misfire but one still remained intermittent between 7,500 and 8,500 rpm, but it was driveable and allowed Lauda to be 2nd fastest in the warmup to Piquet. In truth however, without Ghinzani&#x27;s accident and the extra 30 minutes, the McLaren team wouldn&#x27;t have fixed Lauda&#x27;s car on time and the former dual World Champion would have been forced to race the spare car, meaning Prost would not have even started.

At the start, Piquet almost stalled on the grid and was passed by Rosberg and Mansell. The Lotus then faltered and Mansell fell down the order, putting Piquet back up to second by the first corner. At the end of lap 1, Piquet passed Rosberg for the lead, before teammate Fabi moved into second on lap 2. Lauda had made a good start to run fourth; he then overtook Rosberg on lap 4 and Fabi on lap 10. Both Brabhams then hit trouble, needing new tyres before retiring with turbo failures, Fabi on lap 19 and Piquet on lap 30.

From there, Lauda controlled the race and went on to win easily, with Prost over a minute behind in second and the only other driver on the lead lap. Warwick gained his first Formula One podium by finishing third, while completing the top six were Riccardo Patrese (Alfa Romeo, its second points finish in a row giving more, somewhat false, hope that the 890T V8 would be competitive), Andrea de Cesaris (Ligier-Renault) and, gaining his first ever World Championship point, Ayrton Senna in his Toleman-Hart.

<text>The 1984 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Zolder on 29 April 1984. It was the third race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship. It was the 42nd Belgian Grand Prix, and the tenth and last to be held at Zolder. The race was held over 70 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won from pole position by Italian driver Michele Alboreto, driving a Ferrari. It was the third Grand Prix victory for Alboreto, who also became the first Italian driver to win for Ferrari since Ludovico Scarfiotti at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix. British driver Derek Warwick finished second in a Renault, some 42 seconds behind, with Alboreto&#x27;s French teammate René Arnoux third.

Warwick moved into second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, five points behind Frenchman Alain Prost, who failed to finish in his McLaren-TAG.

==Report==

=== Qualifying ===
Goodyear dominated qualifying filling six of the top seven places with Michele Alboreto securing his first career pole position. Ferrari Teammate René Arnoux was second, followed by Keke Rosberg in the Williams FW09-Honda. Derek Warwick, the first Michelin runner, was fourth ahead of Elio de Angelis in the Lotus 95T-Renault and the surprisingly fast ATS D7-BMW in Formula One of Manfred Winkelhock. The McLarens were off the pace with points leader Alain Prost in eighth and Niki Lauda in 14th. Reigning world champion Nelson Piquet qualified his Brabham BT53-BMW ninth. The best of the Pirelli runners was Johnny Cecotto in 16th in his Toleman TG183B-Hart. The only non-qualifier was Philippe Alliot in his RAM-Hart.

=== Race ===
Alboreto led all 70 laps and was even able to retain the lead during pit stops, despite Piquet pushing through without stopping. Warwick started well to run second for much of the race with Arnoux, Winkelhock and de Angelis pursuing. Prost and Riccardo Patrese were early retirements with Johnny Cecotto dropping out on lap 1 with a broken clutch.

Lauda&#x27;s McLaren MP4/2 broke its water pump at half-distance, the second such failure for the TAG-Porsche engine after Prost suffered the same fate on the warm up lap in South Africa. Shortly afterwards Winkelhock stopped and Andrea de Cesaris crashed his Ligier JS23-Renault. Piquet found himself third after the stops, but faded as the race neared its conclusion. Arnoux moved into third until he was caught by Rosberg. Piquet&#x27;s BMW engine blew and with a lap to go and Rosberg ran out of fuel, allowing Arnoux to join Alboreto and Warwick on the podium. Rosberg was classified fourth, with de Angelis fifth and Stefan Bellof completing the top six in his Tyrrell 012-Ford.

=== Aftermath ===
The results would change months later as the impact of Tyrrell Racing&#x27;s disqualification from the 1984 season saw Stefan Bellof removed from sixth position, promoting Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Toleman TG183B into the points.

The Belgian Grand Prix would return to traditional home at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in 1985. The shortened version of the home of Belgian motorsport had its Formula One debut the previous year and proven instantly popular as Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s death two years earlier at Zolder was still fresh.

<text>The 1984 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 6 May 1984. It was the fourth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

== Report ==
=== Pre-race ===
A dispute between the Toleman team and tyre suppliers Pirelli lead to Ayrton Senna missing out on Friday practice running for his first Grand Prix around Imola. On Saturday his Hart 415T engine developed a misfire leading to Senna failing to qualify, the only time this would happen in the Brazilian&#x27;s F1 career.

=== Race ===
The 60-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG. René Arnoux finished second in a Ferrari, while Elio de Angelis was third in a Lotus-Renault, despite running out of fuel on the last lap, and Derek Warwick finished fourth unable to unlap himself in the last lap (if he managed he would have completed more laps than de Angelis, promoting him onto the podium). Stefan Bellof finished fifth but was disqualified at the end of the season, so Thierry Boutsen and Andrea de Cesaris rounded out the points finishers, despite the second one running out of fuel in the last lap.

<text>The 1984 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Dijon-Prenois near Dijon, France on 20 May 1984. It was race 5 of 16 in the 1984 FIA Formula One World Championship.

This was the final Formula One race to be held at the Dijon-Prenois circuit, as it was deemed too short by governing body FISA. Fittingly in France, Frenchman Patrick Tambay, in the all-French team (French car, French engine, French tyres and French fuel) scored the Equipe Renault team&#x27;s last pole position until their return to the sport in 2002.

Double World Champion Niki Lauda won the race in his McLaren-TAG, his first win in France since 1975. Tambay finished second in his Renault RE50, with the Lotus-Renault of Nigel Mansell third. Lauda&#x27;s team-mate and World Championship leader, Alain Prost, could only manage seventh after he was forced to pit to change a loose wheel.

Andrea de Cesaris failed to qualify his Ligier, but nonetheless started the race and finished tenth. De Cesaris&#x27; Friday qualifying time was disallowed when his car&#x27;s onboard fire extinguisher was found to be empty, before rain in the Saturday session prevented him from setting a time fast enough to make the grid. Ligier took the bizarre step of withdrawing their second car, driven by François Hesnault (who had qualified 14th), in order to allow de Cesaris to start 26th and last.

<text>The 1984 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 3 June 1984. It was race 6 of 16 in the 1984 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was the only race of the 1984 championship that was run in wet weather.

Alain Prost won the rain-curtailed race from pole position. Ayrton Senna was second in his first podium in Formula One. René Arnoux was later promoted to third after the disqualification of Stefan Bellof.

== Practice ==
During practice, Tyrrell&#x27;s Martin Brundle had a huge crash at the Tabac corner. He landed upside down and was slightly injured, but it was enough to make him a non-qualifier for the race. Brundle later said that he ran back to the pits and had actually gotten into the spare car before team boss Ken Tyrrell got on the radio and asked him if he was OK after the accident. It was then discovered that Brundle could not actually remember how he returned to the pits, so the boss wisely would not allow Brundle to go back onto the track and ordered him out of the car. He then took Brundle to see Formula One medical chief Sid Watkins, who after an examination concluded that the rookie driver was slightly concussed and the decision was made to withdraw him from the race weekend.

==Qualifying==
Alain Prost took his first pole position for McLaren with a time of 1:22.661, just ahead of the Lotus-Renault of Nigel Mansell. Prost&#x27;s pole was also the first pole for the McLaren MP4/2 as well as for the TAG-Porsche engine. Stefan Bellof was the only non-turbo qualifier in his Tyrrell-Cosworth. Bellof qualified 20th and last while Brundle&#x27;s crash behind the pits at Tabac saw him as a spectator for the race. Bellof&#x27;s time edged the Arrows-Ford of Marc Surer by just 0.156. The turbo cars of Eddie Cheever (Alfa Romeo) and Thierry Boutsen (Arrows-BMW) both failed to qualify.

BMW had built specially detuned engines for Brabham to use at Monaco. Instead of the normal engines, the Brabhams only had around to play with, the theory being that full power was not needed at Monaco and the detuned engines would be more drivable. It was also an attempt at better reliability as the team had yet to score a point for the year. Never at ease at Monaco, reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet qualified 9th. With Teo Fabi having commitments to race the US based IndyCars at Milwaukee on the same weekend his brother Corrado Fabi drove the second Brabham, qualifying 15th.

==Race==
The race, held amidst heavy rain, was one of the most contentious in Formula One history, and announced the emergence of at least two new stars. Alain Prost took the first of his four victories at the circuit.

The race start was delayed by 45 minutes due to the heavy rain. With the rain soaking the track, Niki Lauda sought out Bernie Ecclestone on the grid in a bid to have the tunnel flooded as well. The tunnel was dry but coated with oil from the previous days&#x27; use (as well as from the historic cars which were on the program that weekend) which Lauda explained had turned it into a fifth gear skid pad when the cars came racing in carrying the spray from their tyres in the morning warmup. Ecclestone used his power as the head of the Formula One Constructors Association to do exactly that, with a local fire truck called in to water down the only dry road on the track.

Pole-sitter Prost led the race from the start, while first corner contact between Ferrari&#x27;s René Arnoux and the Renault of Derek Warwick pitched Warwick&#x27;s car into the fence on the outside of St. Devote and into the path of his team-mate Patrick Tambay. Both drivers suffered leg injuries; Warwick bruised his left leg while Tambay broke his leg after his car&#x27;s suspension punched through the carbon fibre monocoque, causing him to miss the next round in Canada.

Prost was passed on lap nine by Nigel Mansell, to lead a Grand Prix for the first time, when Prost&#x27;s TAG engine was misfiring and he was delayed by both Corrado Fabi&#x27;s stalled Brabham and Michele Alboreto&#x27;s about-to-be-lapped Ferrari just before the tunnel (Prost actually hit a marshal who was pushing Fabi&#x27;s car away but with no serious injury). Mansell pulled away from Prost at around two seconds per lap, before going off six laps later on the run up to Casino Square after sliding on a painted white line, damaging his car and retiring from the race. 

Lauda disposed of Arnoux but Prost assumed the lead again, only to have the Toleman-Hart of Ayrton Senna, who had also passed the Ferrari, quickly closing in. Senna had started thirteenth in the generally uncompetitive Toleman, in the first Formula One street race in his rookie season, and was showing his wet weather skills that would become legendary. On lap 29, Prost waved to the stewards of the race to indicate that he felt the race should be stopped. He was also suffering from a major brake imbalance as his McLaren&#x27;s carbon brakes were locking due to not generating enough heat in the conditions, the same problem that had caused Lauda to spin at Casino Square on lap 23, whereupon he stalled his engine and was out of the race. A slowing Prost waved again on lap 31 as he passed the start/finish line.

The red flag to stop the race was shown at the end of the 32nd lap after clerk of the course Jacky Ickx decided that conditions were too poor for the race to continue. Senna passed Prost&#x27;s slowing McLaren before the finish line, but according to the rules, the positions counted are those from the last lap completed by every driver – lap 31, at which point Prost was still leading. The stoppage was controversial, as it benefited Prost with a Porsche-designed engine, and was made by Ickx, the lead driver with the factory run Rothmans Porsche team in sports car racing. Ickx was suspended from his race control duties for not consulting with the stewards over his decision before making it. 

Stefan Bellof, running in the only naturally aspirated car in the race, finished third. Bellof had qualified 20th and last in his Tyrrell 012-Cosworth. His drive from last to third was a stand-out achievement in his short career, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell. His drive led to negotiations with Ferrari for a drive for 1986 alongside Michele Alboreto, as René Arnoux was under contract in 1985. The Tyrrell team&#x27;s results were erased later in the season due to weight infringements, meaning that Bellof was stripped of his podium finish, with his place being taken by René Arnoux. It would prove to be Bellof&#x27;s only podium visit during his Formula One career. 

This was the first time that Ayrton Senna had set a Formula One fastest lap. It was also Toleman&#x27;s second and final fastest lap in Formula One (Derek Warwick had set the team&#x27;s only other fastest lap during the 1982 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort).

<text>The 1984 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal on 17 June 1984. It was the seventh race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

The 70-lap race was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-BMW. Piquet took pole position, led all 70 laps and set the fastest race lap, finishing 2.6 seconds ahead of Austrian Niki Lauda in the McLaren-TAG. Lauda&#x27;s French teammate, Alain Prost, finished third.

The top six was completed by Elio de Angelis in the Lotus-Renault, René Arnoux in the Ferrari, and Nigel Mansell in the other Lotus-Renault.

After the race, Piquet climbed out of his car and collapsed on the ground, due to a badly burned right foot caused by the extreme heat from his Brabham&#x27;s new nose-mounted oil cooler which had actually burned a hole in his driving boot. In the next race at Detroit, he had a special tray of ice for easing the blisters on his foot.

<text>Family Radio is a non-profit Christian radio network based in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. Established in 1959, Family Radio airs Calvinist teaching and Christian music. The network is most widely known for its false 2011 end times predictions. At one time the 19th largest broadcaster in the United States, with 216 radio stations, the number of stations in the network has dropped drastically following their failed end times predictions.

==Programming==
One of Family Radio&#x27;s oldest broadcasts was a telephone-talk program called &quot;Open Forum&quot; in which Harold Camping, the network&#x27;s co-founder, president and general manager, responded to callers&#x27; questions and comments, as they relate to the Bible, and used the platform to promote his various end-time predictions. The program was finally cancelled not long after Camping&#x27;s third failed &quot;rapture-less&quot; prediction and a stroke which he suffered in June 2011. Other programs that have aired on Family Radio over the years include the morning programs &quot;Rise and Rejoice&quot; and &quot;The Christian Home&quot;; &quot;Family Bible Reading Fellowship&quot;, a half-hour Bible reading program; &quot;Radio Reading Circle&quot;, featuring readings of Christian books; the overnight program &quot;Nightwatch&quot;; &quot;Echoes&quot;, which features recordings of sermons delivered by pastors from churches around the world); &quot;Music to Live By&quot;, an afternoon program; the nighttime program &quot;The Quiet Hours&quot;; &quot;Family Bible Study&quot;; and &quot;Beyond Intelligent Design&quot;. Outside programming broadcast over the Family Radio network was limited as Camping considered the organized church apostate, and therefore devoid of God&#x27;s Spirit and under Satan&#x27;s control.

==History==
Originally founded by Richard H. Palmquist, with the assistance of Harold Camping and Lloyd Lindquist as fellow members of the initial Board of Directors, Family Radio began obtaining FM broadcasting licenses on commercial frequencies in 1959, and by 2006, was ranked 19th among top broadcast companies in number of radio stations owned. Its first radio station, KEAR in San Francisco, California, then at 97.3 MHz, came on the air on Wednesday, February 4, 1959.

In 1992, Family Radio began teaching that the Great Tribulation began in May 1988, and that the rapture would occur on September 6, 1994, later adjusting the predicted date to between September 15 and 27, 1994, and telling listeners not to make any long term plans. The network&#x27;s promotion of these predictions caused some nations in Asia to prevent Family Radio from commencing operations in their countries.

Beginning in the late 1990s, Family Radio began gradually dropping outside ministries because of doctrinal changes in the network. As board members left the organization, they were not being replaced. Harold Camping&#x27;s controversial teachings, as they were changing, became the focus of the entire network. Up until the late 1980s, Family Radio endorsed local church attendance but once Camping stated that the church age was over and that Satan had taken over the churches, he went on to say that people could no longer be saved within churches and that Christians should not be members or attend church services of any type. His actions led to mounting criticism from former supporters and led some Family Radio staff members to resign, as well as prompting some outside ministries to leave the network. The loss of these programs from the Family Radio schedule gave Camping more airtime to express his teachings. Around this time, former Family Radio employees, pastors, cult specialists, and others, began to publicly describe Family Radio as a cult.

===Failed 2011 end times prediction===

Leading up to May 2011, Family Radio spent in the vicinity of $100 million to advertise the now-discredited 2011 end times prediction. In the lead up to the predicted day of the rapture, many followers of Family Radio&#x27;s teachings spent their life savings to donate to Family Radio or personally advertise the predicted rapture date. Others quit their jobs, sold their homes, and went into debt, relying on Camping&#x27;s predictions. Several suicides were attributed to the station&#x27;s apocalyptic teachings, and a woman in California tried to kill her two daughters and herself, believing that she was sparing them the tribulation that would occur following the rapture predicted by the station.

The network&#x27;s apocalyptic predictions, and its followers reactions to them, led to media descriptions of the network as a doomsday cult. Scholars of apocalyptic groups found the various responses among Family Radio&#x27;s followers to be consistent with what they expected to see among members of a cult, with disillusioned followers concurring that Family Radio is a cult. 

Two days after the forecast &quot;Rapture&quot; failed to happen, A Bible Answer, a Bible teaching ministry who had been tired of the &quot;Rapture&quot; predictions, offered to buy 66 full-powered radio stations from Family Radio founder Harold Camping in an effort to get him to resign from preaching this doctrine. The offer came with a catch – they were not to take possession of the stations until October 22, the day after Camping&#x27;s revised set-date for the end of the world. A Bible Answer&#x27;s website called for Camping to resign from the Family Radio board, citing &quot;the self-proclaimed expert on the Bible has brought reproach upon Christ, the Bible, and the church,&quot; and added &quot;After taking the money of his supporters, let Harold give up all he has, to show he believes what he is preaching. He does not or else he would sell. It is time to get new leadership at Family Radio.&quot;

====Aftermath====
On August 3, 2011, the radio industry website Radio-Info.com reported that Family Radio was putting two of its full-powered FM stations up for sale. These stations were: WKDN in Camden, New Jersey (covering Philadelphia), and WFSI in Annapolis, Maryland (covering Baltimore and Washington, D.C.). The article indicated that the network may have sold the stations to pay off &quot;operating deficits accumulated over the last several years&quot;. WFSI would be purchased in November 2011 by CBS Radio, which converted the station to a Spanish language dance music format under the WLZL call sign. Merlin Media, LLC struck a deal in December 2011 to acquire WKDN, which was relaunched with a talk format under the WWIQ call sign. WWIQ was later sold to Educational Media Foundation in late 2013, and became WKVP, a K-Love affiliate station.

In January 2012, Family Radio applied to the FCC to change the license of station WFME in Newark, New Jersey, near New York City, from non-commercial to commercial. The application quickly prompted conjecture from radio industry monitors that the station would soon be sold. The application was approved in February. Those rumors were confirmed on October 16, 2012, when it was announced that Family Stations would sell WFME to Atlanta-based Cumulus Media for an undisclosed price. A November message from Camping posted on the Family Radio website admitted, &quot;Either we sell WFME or go off the air completely.&quot; The 94.7 signal would be relaunched as country-formatted station, WNSH. Concurrent with 94.7&#x27;s sale to Cumulus, Family Radio purchased FM station WDVY in Mount Kisco, New York from Cumulus, which would soon after adopt Family Radio&#x27;s programming and the WFME-FM callsign.

After 40 years on the air, WYFR, Family Radio&#x27;s shortwave station located in Okeechobee, Florida, ceased operations on July 1, 2013. In December 2013, Radio Miami International, purchased the shortwave transmission complex and began broadcasting from there; the complex now operates under the WRMI call letters.

Harold Camping died from a fall on December 15, 2013, in his home in Alameda, California. His death was confirmed by an employee of the network. Following Camping&#x27;s death, the network reaffirmed its commitment to his teachings, specifically the belief that all churches had become apostate, and that true Christians should not attend church.

On November 21, 2014, The Walt Disney Company announced it would sell WQEW in New York City to Family Radio for $12.95 million, part of Disney&#x27;s decision to end terrestrial distribution of the Radio Disney format. The sale was approved on February 10, 2015, and the station returned on the air on February 27 as the new WFME (AM), thus giving Family Radio full coverage of the New York City metropolitan area for the first time in two years. Concurrent with the sale, the FCC converted WFME&#x27;s broadcasting status from commercial to non-commercial. WFME has since been taken off the air, following Family Radio&#x27;s sale of its transmitter site.

During 2016, Family Radio moved its corporate offices and main studios from Oakland, where it had been based since the network&#x27;s inception, to the adjacent East Bay city of Alameda.

In September 2018, Family Radio announced it would no longer air programs featuring the voice of Harold Camping, and would no longer distribute literature of Camping&#x27;s teachings. The decision was made as part of an effort to both move away from Camping&#x27;s theology, and to reintroduce programs from outside ministries into the network&#x27;s schedule. The changes went into effect on October 8, 2018.

In 2019, Family Radio announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Alameda, California to Franklin, Tennessee.

==Finances==
In 1994, Family Radio owned forty radio stations nationwide. The listenership of Family Radio understandably declined after the failed 1994 rapture prediction, but before long the organization was again growing at a fast rate. By the time of his second campaign, the organization boasted 216 AM and FM radio stations, along with two television channels.

Financial strength hit a peak in 2007 when Family Radio reported $135 million in assets. As net assets declined from that point forward, listener contributions steadily increased. Upon the outset of the second campaign, the organizations assets dropped while contributions simultaneously rose indicating an increased level of spending by the organization, far surpassing the increase in income. In 2008, total contributions were well over $15 million. 2009 saw an annual budget of $36.7 million with $117 million in assets and $18.4 million in contributions. IRS records also indicate that Family Radio employed 348 persons in 2009. In 2010 assets were down to $110 million while contributions rose to $18.7 million while the station maintained 346 employees. In 2011 contributions fell to $17.2 million and assets dropped to $87.6 million, while the organization also lost 26 employees. By the end of 2011 the organizations assets had dropped to $29.2 million, and the next year was forced to take out a $30 million loan.

==Ideology and teachings==

Central to Camping&#x27;s teaching was the belief that each sentence in the Bible is not to be understood only literally, but rather conveys multiple levels of cryptic meanings. In Camping&#x27;s words, &quot;the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning.&quot; In Camping&#x27;s publication, &quot;We are Almost There!&quot;, he stated that certain Biblical passages pointed unquestionably to May 21, 2011, as the date of &quot;Rapture&quot;, and pointed to October 21, 2011, as the end of the world. This event did not occur on May 21 or October 21 of that year, and no acknowledgment of false teaching has yet been offered concerning the October 21 event.

As a result of spending millions of dollars to promote his &quot;end of the world&quot; theory, many people sold everything they owned and donated it to Family Radio, sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars. The California Attorney General&#x27;s office has been asked by the Freedom from Religion Foundation to investigate Camping and Family Stations, Inc. for &quot;Fraud and Deceit&quot;.

After leaving the Christian Reformed Church in 1987, Camping taught doctrines that largely conflicted with traditional Christian teaching. The principles of Biblical hermeneutics upon which Camping framed his present teachings are:

# The Bible alone is the Word of God, and anyone who believes that God has spoken to them through a dream, vision, or spoke in tongues, is adding to the Bible and is damned to hell.
# Every Biblical passage must be interpreted in the light of the Bible as a whole, and red letter editions of the Bible should not be used.
# The Bible normally conveys multiple levels of meaning or significance, and those who do not believe in all of the multiple cryptic meanings are likewise damned to hell.
# Numerology should be applied to numbers in the Bible, but only when following the meaning Camping applies to the number.
# That salvation is unmerited and cannot be achieved by good works, prayer, belief or acceptance. It is a pure act of God&#x27;s grace and that those to be saved were chosen &quot;before the foundation of the world&quot;. Camping also taught that all churches had become apostate and were under Satan&#x27;s control, and that people could not be saved within churches.

Following Camping&#x27;s death, the network reaffirmed its commitment to his teachings, specifically the belief that all churches had become apostate, and that true Christians should not attend church. For several years after Camping&#x27;s death in 2013, Family Radio continued to air some of his past broadcasts and distribute his literature. But in October 2018, Family Radio discontinued using any of Camping&#x27;s commentary and content, after outside ministries expressed a reluctance to allow their shows on the network while Camping&#x27;s programs aired, stating &quot;so much of it still contains elements that are very difficult.&quot;

==Stations==
The flagship station for the network of both full-power and low-power translator stations is KEAR in San Francisco. With the sale of KEAR-FM to CBS Radio in 2005, broadcasts from San Francisco moved to an AM radio frequency. Due to FCC rules regarding translator stations, the legal primary station for the translators was changed to KEAR-FM in Sacramento, after the former primary FM station in San Francisco was sold to CBS Radio.
Notes:
In addition to its full-powered stations, Family Radio is relayed by an additional 20 FM translators:

<doc id="1122890" wikidata="Q596105" url="?curid=1122890" title="1984 Dallas Grand Prix">
<text>The 1984 Dallas Grand Prix was a one-off Formula One motor race held on July 8, 1984 at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas. It was the only running of the Dallas Grand Prix as a Formula One race, and the ninth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

The 67-lap race was held in very hot weather on a disintegrating track, and was won by Finnish driver Keke Rosberg, driving a Williams-Honda, with Frenchman René Arnoux second in a Ferrari and Italian Elio de Angelis third in a Lotus-Renault. Englishman Nigel Mansell took pole position in the other Lotus-Renault and led the first half of the race, before suffering a gearbox failure at the very end and collapsing from exhaustion while trying to push his car over the finish line.

==Summary==

Keke Rosberg of Finland won his only race of the season at the Dallas Grand Prix. The race was one of only two races in 1984 where both of the year&#x27;s dominant McLarens driven by Niki Lauda and Alain Prost did not score (Belgium being the other), and gave Honda their first turbocharged Grand Prix win and also their first Grand Prix win since the 1967 Italian Grand Prix. René Arnoux&#x27;s Ferrari was the only other car on the lead lap at the end after starting from the pit lane due to an electrical fault on the warm up lap, while Elio de Angelis came home third for Lotus. It was the only race of the season that cars using Goodyear tyres filled all three podium positions. Only 8 cars finished the race, due to crashes or engine failures in up to heat, and also the track was breaking up very badly, as in the 1980 Argentine Grand Prix.

The event was conceived as a way to demonstrate Dallas&#x27;s status as a &quot;world-class city&quot; and overcame heat, a disintegrating track surface and weekend-long rumors of its cancellation. Famous U.S. racing driver and race car builder Carroll Shelby, who grew up in Dallas, served as race director. Preparations for the race were marred by managerial difficulties and conflicts between F1 personnel and local race organizers, and opinions on the venue were mixed. In statements to the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, Lotus team principal Peter Warr said he was &quot;super impressed&quot; with Dallas, but F1 leader Bernie Ecclestone—commenting on the repurposing of the Fair Park Coliseum, which was normally used for livestock shows, as a race garage—said “We don’t normally work in cowshit”.

The tight and twisty course was laid out on the Texas State Fair Grounds with help from United States Grand Prix West founder Chris Pook, and featured two hairpin curves. While the layout was seen as interesting and was generally well received by the drivers (though some thought one or two of the chicanes made it tighter than it needed to be), all had issues with the lack of run-off areas and the crumbling surface which during the race itself made the track more like a rallycross track than a Grand Prix circuit. It was bubbling before qualifying, and after a few laps, it began to break apart.

After the first practice on Friday, the Lotus drivers, Nigel Mansell and de Angelis, who both started from the front row with Mansell recording his first career pole position, said the temporary course was the roughest circuit they had ever driven. Nelson Piquet wondered whether the track, the drivers or the cars would break first in the oppressive heat. Afternoon qualifying saw temperatures continue to rise past , and Goodyear recorded the highest track temperature in their 20 years of racing, .

Dallas was the first time since the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort that both Lotus drivers qualified on the front row of the grid. Back then, it was World Champion Mario Andretti and his teammate Ronnie Peterson who qualified 1–2 in the revolutionary Lotus 79.

After the Renault celebrity race on Saturday, Stirling Moss introduced himself to former US President Jimmy Carter in the VIP suite, saying, &quot;I have never shaken hands with a president.&quot; Carter, to the surprise of many (due to the general belief that Formula One drivers weren&#x27;t as well known in America as the Indy 500 and NASCAR drivers), recognized Moss immediately.

The race was scheduled to start at 11 am on Sunday, three hours earlier than usual, because of the heat, with the 30-minute warm-up planned for 7:45 am. This was apparently &quot;too&quot; early for French Williams driver Jacques Laffite, who arrived at the circuit in his pajamas. The warm-up was delayed and then canceled however, because a 50-lap Can-Am race on Saturday had damaged the circuit so badly that emergency repairs had gone on all night, and would continue until 30 minutes before the start (the repairs involved a backhoe digging up the broken asphalt and replacing it with quick-dry cement). Niki Lauda and Alain Prost tried to arrange a boycott among the drivers, but Rosberg insisted they should race.

Ecclestone did not want to have 90,000 disappointed fans at the circuit, and viewers around the world, so the race went off with Larry Hagman (J. R. Ewing from the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;) waving the green flag to start the parade lap.

Mansell led for almost half the race from his first pole position. Derek Warwick overtook de Angelis, whose engine was suffering from a misfire, and pulled alongside Mansell several times, but could not get around. He retired after an attempt to pass on lap 11 resulted in a spin. Lauda was next to challenge Mansell, but he was passed by de Angelis when the latter&#x27;s engine began to run on all six cylinders.

The first five cars (Mansell, de Angelis, Lauda, Rosberg, Prost) were now running as a group, and on lap 14, Rosberg passed Lauda for third and closed up on the two Lotuses. He passed de Angelis on lap 18, and soon was looking for a way past Mansell. Arnoux, having qualified fourth, had been unable to start his car on the grid, and began the race from the back of the pack. By the end of the first lap, he had already passed seven cars and now he and Piquet were closing on the group of leaders.

Rosberg, after briefly trading places with Prost, who had gotten by Lauda and de Angelis, finally forced Mansell into a big enough mistake for him to take the lead. Within three laps, Mansell, whose front tires were quickly fading, had dropped three more places before pitting on lap 38. Piquet became the ninth car to retire because of contact with the wall, and Arnoux moved into the top five.

Prost took the lead from Rosberg on lap 49, and quickly opened a 7.5-second lead, but eight laps later struck a wall and damaged a wheel rim. Rosberg inherited a lead of 10 seconds over Arnoux, and, thanks in part to a special skull cap driver cooling system, held on to score his only victory of the year for Williams, as the two-hour limit was reached one lap short of the scheduled 68.

De Angelis came home third, comfortably ahead of Laffite in the second Williams. De Angelis&#x27;s teammate Mansell made contact with the wall. Mansell coasted around the last corner, visor up and seat belts hanging over the side of the car. As his car slowed on the home straight, he leaped from his black Lotus and tried to push it to the end, but collapsed from exhaustion and the oppressive heat before reaching the finish line. He was classified sixth, three laps behind.

The oppressive heat was a factor of the Dallas Grand Prix becoming a one-off, and the event was replaced by the following year&#x27;s Australian Grand Prix. Formula One has since returned to the state of Texas, hosting the United States Grand Prix since 2012 at the newly constructed Circuit of the Americas, located in the state capital of Austin. However, the race in Austin has always been held in October or November, away from the Texas summer.

The heat also caused some drivers to take some countermeasures to cope with the heat; such as Rosberg&#x27;s water-cooled skullcap (a common device in the NASCAR circuit); Piercarlo Ghinzani, who finished fifth after overtaking the collapsed Mansell, having a bucket of cold water thrown over him during a pit stop; and Huub Rothengatter, who dashed straight to a spectator area after he retired from the race, where he commandeered several cups of water &quot;for pouring over his nether regions…&quot;.

Ayrton Senna had retired from the race on lap 47 while running fourth after hitting the wall. On coming back to the pits, he was furious, telling his race engineer Pat Symonds: &quot;I just cannot understand how I did that. I was taking it no differently than I had been before. The wall must have moved.&quot; His team did not believe him and Senna persuaded them to inspect the wall after the race, only for them to find that the barrier had indeed been moved by an earlier crash, moving only a mere into the track. Symonds recalled his amazement in 2004, saying: &quot;That was when the precision to which he was driving really hit home for me. Don&#x27;t forget, this was a guy in his first season of F1, straight out of F3...&quot;.

==Aftermath==
In a 2022 statement to &quot;D Magazine&quot;, Waldrop said the July date was chosen to minimize the possibility of rain during the event, and expressed regret that the organizers did not adequately anticipate the effects of Texas summer heat on the event generally and the pavement specifically.

Financial problems and safety concerns led to the 1985 race being cancelled. Race organizer Dallas Grand Prix of Texas Inc., led by local real estate investor Don Walker, had executed a contract with the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA) to hold five races in Dallas. Walker clashed with co-organizers and officials and spent money prodigiously. He could not agree with FOCA or Dallas officials on a 1985 race date, and the company would not pay the front money for the second race. Both Walker and Dallas Grand Prix of Texas Inc. ended up in financial distress and were soon under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that Walker had illegally siphoned money from the company to fund his extravagant lifestyle. Co-organizer Larry Waldrop negotiated with Ecclestone in late 1984 in an attempt to bypass Walker and revive the event, but the effort came to naught. The company entered bankruptcy in March 1985, ending any possibility that a follow-on F1 race would take place at Fair Park.

Another major obstacle was pushback from residents of the nearby, populous Fair Park neighborhood, which was majority Black and low-income. Dallas city councilwoman Diane Ragsdale told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the failure of organizers to consult with neighbors and take noise concerns seriously were part of a historic pattern of &quot;total disrespect for the neighborhood.&quot; Ragsdale and the Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against Walker and Dallas Grand Prix of Texas Inc.; in 2022, Waldrop said that it was the main hurdle in his late 1984 FOCA negotiations, because he could not guarantee that authorities would allow the 1985 race to take place. 1984 co-organizer Buddy Boren was eventually able to hold a 1988 Trans-Am Series race at Fair Park after agreeing to donate some race receipts to charity; however, continued noise complaints prompted relocation of the 1989 event to Addison Airport.

<text>Thomas Taylor (15 May 17581 November 1835) was an English translator and Neoplatonist, the first to translate into English the complete works of Aristotle and of Plato, as well as the Orphic fragments.

==Biography==

Thomas Taylor was born in the City of London on 15 May 1758, the son of a staymaker Joseph Taylor and his wife Mary (born Summers). He was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s School, and devoted himself to the study of the classics and of mathematics. After first working as a clerk in Lubbock&#x27;s Bank, he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Art (precursor to the Royal Society of Arts), in which capacity he made many influential friends, who furnished the means for publishing his various translations, which besides Plato and Aristotle, include Proclus, Porphyry, Apuleius, Ocellus Lucanus and other Neoplatonists and Pythagoreans. His aim was the translation of all the untranslated writings of the ancient Greek philosophers.

Taylor was an admirer of Hellenism, most especially in the philosophical framework furnished by Plato and the Neoplatonists Proclus and the &quot;most divine&quot; Iamblichus, whose works he translated into English. So enamoured was he of the ancients, that he and his wife talked to one another only in classical Greek.

He was also an outspoken voice against corruption in the Christianity of his day, and what he viewed as its shallowness. Taylor was ridiculed and acquired many enemies, but in other quarters he was well received. Among his friends was the eccentric traveller and philosopher John &quot;Walking&quot; Stewart, whose gatherings Taylor was in the habit of attending.

==Family==

Taylor married his childhood sweetheart Mary Morton, daughter of John Morton, in 1777, and they had children George Burrow Taylor (born 1779), John Buller Taylor (1781), William Grainger Taylor (1783-1785), Mary Joseph Taylor (1789) and Thomas Taylor (1791). Their eldest daughter, Mary Meredith Taylor (1787–1861), was named after his generous patron William Meredith and married a haberdasher, Samuel Beverly Jones. His wife Mary died in 1809. He married again, and his second wife Susannah died in 1823. From his second marriage he had one son, Thomas Proclus Taylor (born 1816).

Thomas Taylor died in Walworth.

==Influence==
The texts that he used had been edited since the 16th century, but were interrupted by lacunae; Taylor&#x27;s understanding of the Platonists informed his suggested emendations. His translations were influential on William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and William Wordsworth. In American editions they were read by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott, and G. R. S. Mead, secretary to Helena Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society. 

Taylor also published several original works on philosophy (in particular, the Neoplatonism of Proclus and Iamblichus) and mathematics. These works have been republished (some for the first time since Taylor&#x27;s lifetime) by the Prometheus Trust. 

It appears that he and his wife were landlords at Walworth in the late 1770s to a family that included the 18-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft; it is not clear whether the future author of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; actually knew the Taylors, as at that age she left home for a job as a lady&#x27;s companion. Taylor responded to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s 1792 &quot;magnum opus&quot; (as well as Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot;) in his satirical essay, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes&quot;. In it, Taylor attempted to demonstrate the absurdity of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s arguments by arguing that if the argument for equality was sound when it applied to women, why not for animals too? Wollstonecraft&#x27;s reasoning seemed to hold for “brutes” too; yet, Taylor argued, to hold that brutes had rights was manifestly absurd. Therefore, Taylor contended, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s reasoning must be unsound; the same arguments were used in each case, and if unsound when applied to animals, they must also be unsound when applied to women.

<text>The 1984 British Grand Prix (formally the XXXVII John Player British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch, Kent, England on 22 July 1984. It was the tenth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by Austrian Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG, with local driver Derek Warwick second in a Renault and Brazilian Ayrton Senna third in a Toleman-Hart. Lauda&#x27;s teammate Alain Prost retired shortly after half distance with a gearbox failure, enabling Lauda to reduce the Frenchman&#x27;s lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 1.5 points.

==Report==
===Background===
Going into the race, McLaren driver Alain Prost led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34.5 points. Teammate Niki Lauda was second on 24, closely followed by Lotus&#x27;s Elio de Angelis on 23.5, Ferrari&#x27;s René Arnoux on 22.5, Williams&#x27; Keke Rosberg on 20 and Brabham&#x27;s Nelson Piquet on 18. McLaren led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 58.5 points, comfortably ahead of Ferrari on 31.5, Lotus on 29.5, Williams on 24 and Brabham on 21.

Prior to the event, the FIA announced that the Tyrrell team would be disqualified from the World Championship for the illegal use of fuel and ballast on their cars. The ruling resulted in Tyrrell losing the 13 points they had scored in the first nine races of the season. Tyrrell owner Ken Tyrrell was granted a High Court order to allow their cars to compete in the Friday Qualifying session. As a result of his crash in the previous race at Dallas in which he broke both of his ankles, Martin Brundle was replaced in the No. 4 Tyrrell by Swedish driver Stefan Johansson.

===Qualifying===
Johnny Cecotto broke both legs after a heavy crash during first practice. He would never race in Formula One again. Nelson Piquet claimed pole position. Niki Lauda&#x27;s win for McLaren saw him become the highest point scorer in Formula One history, passing Jackie Stewart&#x27;s 360 points.

Renault driver Derek Warwick gave the British fans something to cheer when he finished 42 seconds behind Lauda in second place, while Cecotto&#x27;s Toleman teammate Ayrton Senna finished 21 seconds behind Warwick in third. Lotus-Renault driver Elio de Angelis kept his championship hopes alive finishing a lap down in fourth place. He was followed by the two Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and René Arnoux in the final points positions.

Lauda&#x27;s win saw him move to 33 points and with Prost failing to finish his championship lead was cut to just 1.5 points. With 67.5 points, McLaren had scored almost double the number of Constructors&#x27; points than second placed Ferrari who were on 34.5 points.

Eddie Cheever (Alfa Romeo), Philippe Alliot (RAM) and Jo Gartner (Osella) were all outed in a first lap crash which started when Riccardo Patrese lost his Alfa going into the Graham Hill Bend. The race was stopped after 11 laps to clear Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s RAM.

<text>Harvie Andre, (July 27, 1940 – October 21, 2012) was a Canadian engineer, businessman, politician and federal Cabinet minister.

Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Andre was educated at the University of Alberta (’62, PhD ’66) and pursued part of his postgraduate studies at the California Institute of Technology before becoming a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Calgary from 1966 to 1972. In the 1972 general election he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, where he served as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Calgary Centre for twenty-one years.

In opposition, Andre was a vocal opponent of Petro-Canada and the National Energy Program. He also served as the defence critic.

He was appointed to the Cabinet after the 1984 election brought the Tories to power under Brian Mulroney. Andre served as Minister of Supply and Services until 1985 when he became Associate Minister of National Defence. From 1986 to 1989, he was Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and then Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion until 1990. In addition, in 1987 Mulroney gave Andre responsibility for Canada Post Corporation.

For the last three years of the Mulroney government, Andre was Government House Leader. He did not run for re-election in the 1993 federal election, and returned to private life.

After leaving politics, Andre was involved in the business world, particularly the energy sector, as president of Cresvard Corporation since 1998, chief executive of Calgary-based Wenzel Downhole Tools and chairman of BowEnergy Resources since 2001. He served on numerous corporate boards of directors.

DeVille&#x27;s audition impressed drummer Rikki Rockett and bassist Bobby Dall, but angered vocalist Bret Michaels. DeVille refused to play the songs that had been given to him as preparation, and instead jammed with a guitar riff he had written. The riff, which would eventually be featured in the Poison single &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, would ultimately launch the band&#x27;s career.

DeVille co-wrote Poison&#x27;s debut album with Bret Michaels, Bobby Dall, and Rikki Rockett. &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; was released on August 2, 1986. It included the hits &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, &quot;I Want Action&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;. Sales for the album topped 3 million copies in the United States. DeVille also wrote much of the material for Poison&#x27;s second album, the multi-platinum selling &quot;Open Up And Say... Ahh!&quot;, which was released on May 21, 1988 and would ultimately go on to sell 8 million copies worldwide. It included the hit song &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot;, co-written by DeVille, and Poison&#x27;s only number 1 single &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;.

In 1990, Poison released the multi-platinum selling &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;, an album which was again largely written by DeVille. 

===Leaving Poison===
While touring in support of &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, and despite Poison&#x27;s success, substance abuse and tensions with other members of the band, particularly lead singer Bret Michaels, led to conflict within the band. Leading up to the release of the live album &quot;Swallow This Live&quot; conflict between Michaels and DeVille culminated in a fistfight backstage at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards after DeVille played the wrong song, playing &quot;Talk Dirty To Me&quot; instead of &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot;, and being high and intoxicated during the performance. Asked to quit, DeVille left Poison and was replaced by guitarist Richie Kotzen.

Following his departure from Poison, DeVille formed Needle Park, a band that also featured vocalist Spike of The Quireboys, bassist Tommy Henriksen, and drummer James Kottak (later of Scorpions), and recorded &quot;Hey, Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; for the soundtrack to the Pauly Shore movie &quot;Son in Law&quot;.

===Samantha 7===
Samantha 7 was a short-lived band composed of guitarist DeVille, guitarist Ty Longley, bassist Krys Baratto, and drummer Francis Ruiz. They played at Woodstock 1999. Originally the band&#x27;s name was The Stepmothers, but the band was forced to change their name following a legal dispute with another band of the same name. DeVille can be heard referring to this band as The Stepmothers in a Behind the Music interview. Samantha 7 released the self-titled album &quot;Samantha 7&quot; in 2000, and toured the US and UK in support of the record that was released on Columbia/Portrait Records.

The Samantha 7 song &quot;I Wanna be Famous&quot; would later be used in the opening of the reality show &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot;, in which DeVille starred.

===Return to Poison===
DeVille regained contact with his Poison bandmates in 1996 for their Greatest Hits reunion tour in 1999. Several shows were recorded and released as a hybrid studio &amp; live album release in 2000 titled &quot;Power to the People.&quot; DeVille continues to record and perform with Poison. In 2022, the band completed The Stadium Tour, a 36 date tour with Def Leppard, Joan Jett and Mötley Crüe in football stadiums across the US which grossed $173.5 million in ticket sales.

==Television==
In 2005 and 2006, DeVille starred in a TV series &quot;South of Nowhere&quot; on The N. He played the role of Raife Davies, the father of Ashley Davies and Kyla Woods.
Also in 2006 when Poison celebrated their 20th anniversary, DeVille starred in &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; on VH1. He also starred in the spin-off series &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot; in 2007. In 2002, DeVille had a brief cameo appearance as &quot;Lloyd&quot;, a member of the airband GFK Groovecart, on the last episode of season 6 of &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (titled &quot;The Boys In The Band&quot;).

==Family==
In March 2007, DeVille and his girlfriend Shannon Malone became parents with the birth of Vallon Deville Johannesson.

Vallon is also a musician, and plays drums with The Finz, an American rock band local to Southern California.

==Parodies==
In 2001, DeVille became the inspiration for rock &amp; roll comic C.C. Banana. A twisted homage to DeVille, C.C. Banana speaks in a cartoonish parody of DeVille&#x27;s voice and wears a large yellow banana costume. C.C. Banana has interviewed numerous rock stars and made many TV appearances.

Parody act Beatallica mentioned DeVille in the song &quot;I want to choke your band&quot;, the theme of which pits heavy metal bands against glam metal like Warrant, Poison, and Whitesnake. The lyric goes &quot;No mercy for C.C., &#x27;cuz he&#x27;s in a hair band&quot;.

<text>The 1984 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 19 August 1984. It was the twelfth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship, and the 400th Grand Prix held as part of the World Championship since it began in .

The 51-lap race was won by local driver Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG. Brazilian Nelson Piquet finished second in a Brabham-BMW, having started from pole position, with Italian Michele Alboreto third in a Ferrari. The win, Lauda&#x27;s fourth of the season, gave him the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by 4.5 points from his French teammate Alain Prost, who spun out shortly after half distance.

==Report==
The race had to be stopped soon after the first start, due to a problem with the starting lights which caused chaos among the drivers with Niki Lauda claiming that he saw &quot;Red, green, yellow then red again&quot;. This caused 3rd fastest qualifier Elio de Angelis to hesitate badly off the line and his Lotus-Renault was almost hit from behind by several cars and saw the Toleman-Hart of Ayrton Senna in 4th place by the time they reached Hella-Licht after starting 10th. On the formation lap for the re-start, pole sitter Piquet, who had seen the McLarens change tyres on the grid, angered the other drivers when he led the field on an extremely slow lap in an effort to not allow Prost or Lauda to scrub in their new Michelin rubber.

Alain Prost, Lauda&#x27;s team mate and the World Championship leader going into the race, failed to finish after spinning off on oil at the Jochen Rindt Curve on lap 28, that came from the Lotus of Elio de Angelis when his Renault engine failed moments before Prost retired (de Angelis later received criticism for continuing to drive his car on the racing line while dropping oil). Prost had been running a close second behind Piquet at the time of his spin. Piquet came upon the oil of de Angelis first and managed to keep his car from sliding off despite a twitch on the oil. Prost however was having gear selection problems and hit the oil with one hand on his steering wheel and the other on his gear lever, spinning off into retirement. Lauda moved into second and then passed Piquet for the lead, the Brazilian suffering tyre trouble. Despite a brief gearbox problem where for a few hundred metres he could not find a gear before eventually finding 4th coming out of the Texaco Schikane, Lauda went on to win his home race by 23 seconds.

Another Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, who would go on to win 10 Grands Prix before retiring at the end of the season, made his Formula One debut at the Österreichring, finishing 12th and last in his ATS-BMW. The third Austrian in the race, Jo Gartner, retired after only 6 laps with engine troubles in his Osella-Alfa Romeo.

Both Renaults retired with engine failures, Derek Warwick on lap 18 and Patrick Tambay on lap 43.

<text>The 1984 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on 26 August 1984. It was the thirteenth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, after he started from pole position. Brazilian Nelson Piquet led the first ten laps in his Brabham-BMW before his oil pressure failed, after which Prost led the remainder of the race. His Austrian teammate Niki Lauda finished second, with Briton Nigel Mansell third in a Lotus-Renault. The 1-2 finish secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for McLaren, their first since .

Before the race, it was rumoured that Ayrton Senna would break his contract with the Toleman team and join Lotus for . When this move was announced two days after the race, Toleman management were angered as Senna had not informed them of his intentions as per the requirements of his contract, and as a result they suspended him from the next race in Italy. It was also correctly rumoured that, with Jacques Laffite already known to be leaving Williams at the end of the season to return to Ligier, team owner Frank Williams had signed Mansell for 1985 alongside Keke Rosberg after his original choice Derek Warwick had decided to stay with the Renault team.

<text>The 1984 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 9 September 1984. It was the fourteenth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship.

The 51-lap race was won by Austrian Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG, with local drivers Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese second and third in a Ferrari and an Alfa Romeo respectively. With teammate Alain Prost retiring, Lauda opened up a 10.5-point lead over the Frenchman in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races remaining.

==Pre-race==
In the fortnight between the Dutch and Italian Grands Prix, the FIA Court of Appeal upheld the exclusion of the Tyrrell team from the championship for alleged technical infringements, and the team were duly banned from the final three races of the season. The Italian Grand Prix would thus be the first all-turbo Formula One race in history.

Meanwhile, the Toleman team had suspended Ayrton Senna for not informing them of his signing for Lotus for before the deal was announced at Zandvoort. Stefan Johansson, out of a drive as a result of Tyrrell&#x27;s ban, was drafted in to replace the Brazilian at Monza; he would be joined by newcomer Pierluigi Martini.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
Nelson Piquet took his seventh pole position of the season in his Brabham, with Alain Prost alongside him on the front row in his McLaren. The second row was made up of Elio de Angelis in the Lotus and Niki Lauda in the second McLaren, while the third row consisted of Teo Fabi in the second Brabham and Keke Rosberg in the Williams. The second Lotus of Nigel Mansell, the Renault of Patrick Tambay and the two Alfa Romeos of Riccardo Patrese and Eddie Cheever completed the top ten. Johansson was 17th in the Toleman while Martini, unfamiliar with the car, came 27th and last and thus failed to qualify.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
===Race report===
Manfred Winkelhock, who had qualified 21st in his ATS, suffered a gearbox failure on the formation lap for the second time in three races. Frustrated, he subsequently quit the team.

At the start, de Angelis passed Prost and Piquet, though the Brabham driver retook the lead into the first chicane. Tambay also made a fast start to run fourth, while Lauda fell to seventh behind Mansell and Fabi. While Piquet set about building a lead, Prost and Tambay overtook de Angelis, only for Prost&#x27;s engine to fail on the fourth lap. In the meantime, Fabi and Lauda passed both Lotuses, and were thus up to third and fourth.

On lap 8, Fabi spun at the Roggia chicane, dropping to eighth; a charge put him back up to fourth by lap 12. By this point, Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari had also passed both Lotuses and was now fifth. While this was going on, a high attrition rate was building: the second Ferrari of René Arnoux suffered a gearbox failure on lap 6, while the two Ligiers of Andrea de Cesaris and François Hesnault dropped out on lap 8, followed shortly afterwards by the two Williams of Rosberg and Jacques Laffite. By lap 15 the two Lotuses had also retired, Mansell spinning off and de Angelis&#x27; gearbox failing.

Piquet continued to lead from Tambay, both clear of Lauda. On lap 16, Piquet&#x27;s engine failed; at around the same time Fabi, continuing his charge, overtook Lauda to run second. Fabi then started to catch up to Tambay and by half-distance was on the Renault&#x27;s tail, with Lauda keeping close behind; all three were clear of Alboreto, with Derek Warwick in the second Renault up to fifth and Cheever sixth. On lap 32, Warwick suffered an oil pressure problem, moving Johansson into the top six.

On lap 40, Lauda overtook Fabi at the Parabolica, before passing Tambay for the lead at the Roggia three laps later. Then, on lap 44, Fabi and Tambay suffered engine and throttle failures respectively. This left Lauda with a lead of 20 seconds over Alboreto, with Cheever up to third followed by Johansson, Patrese and the Osella of Piercarlo Ghinzani. On lap 46 Cheever ran out of fuel, followed three laps later by Ghinzani; meanwhile, Patrese passed Johansson for third. At the chequered flag, only Lauda and Alboreto were on the lead lap, with Patrese one lap behind Lauda and Johansson a further lap back. Completing the top six were Jo Gartner in the second Osella and Gerhard Berger in the second ATS, though neither driver would receive points as both their teams had officially entered only one car for the championship.

The win, Lauda&#x27;s fifth of the season, put him 10.5 points clear of Prost at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races remaining. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Alboreto&#x27;s result enabled Ferrari to move ahead of Lotus into second behind McLaren. As of , Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s third place was the final Formula One podium for Alfa Romeo.

===Race classification===
* Neither Gartner nor Berger were eligible for points, as they were driving the respective &quot;second entries&quot; of Osella and ATS and both teams had officially entered only one car for the entire championship.

<text>The Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń is a Catholic church at the Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland, in the village of Licheń Stary near Konin in the Greater Poland Voivodeship in Poland. 

The building was designed by Barbara Bielecka and built between 1994 and 2004. The construction was funded by pilgrims&#x27; donations. With a tower measuring 141.5 meters in height, it is one of the tallest and largest churches in the world.

Pope John Paul II raised the shrine to the status of minor basilica on 25 February 2005. 
==History==
The history of the foundation of the church dates back to 1813, when Tomasz Kłossowski, a Polish soldier fighting under Napoleon near Leipzig, was seriously wounded. He invoked the Virgin Mary, begging her not to let him die in a foreign land. According to legend, she appeared to him wearing a golden crown, a dark red gown, with a golden mantle, and holding a white eagle in her right hand. She comforted the soldier and promised he would recover and return to Poland. Tomasz was instructed to have an image of her made, and to place the image in a public place so that &quot;My people will pray before this image and shall draw many graces at My hands in the hardest times of trial.&quot;

With the nave 120 meters long and 77 meters wide, with a central dome 98 meters (321 feet) high, and with a tower 141.5 metres (464 feet) tall, it is Poland&#x27;s largest church and one of the largest church buildings in the world. Also, it has one of the tallest domes in the world. The church is dedicated to &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland&quot;, whose icon, perhaps dating back to the 18th century, is displayed on the basilica&#x27;s main altar. It is one of Poland&#x27;s principal pilgrimage sites.

Between 2002 and 2007, Polish organbuilder Zych - on the base of the project made by Prof. Andrzej Chorosiński - built a 157-stop pipe organ (6 manuals and pedalboard). It is the largest organ in Poland, 4th in Europe and 13th around the world.

Pope John Paul II blessed the Basilica in 1999.
In 2007, parts of the Polish museum in Fawley Court were translocated to the shrine by the Marian Fathers.

<text>The 1984 European Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 7 October 1984. It was the fifteenth race of the 1984 Formula One World Championship. It was also the first Formula One race to be held at the Nürburgring since 1976, and the first to be run on the new GP-Strecke circuit, rather than the historic Nordschleife, which after new pit facilities and layout modifications had been shortened so that both circuits could be used at the same time.

The 67-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG. Italian Michele Alboreto finished second in a Ferrari, with Brazilian Nelson Piquet third in a Brabham-BMW, having started from pole position.

Prost&#x27;s Austrian teammate Niki Lauda, who nearly lost his life in the last F1 race at the Nürburgring in 1976, finished fourth. With the reallocation of the disqualified Tyrrell team&#x27;s points two days after the race and Prost thus gaining an extra point, Lauda&#x27;s lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship was reduced to 3.5 points with one race remaining.

==Report==
During the race morning warm-up session, Alain Prost spun his McLaren-TAG and hit a course car parked at the side of the circuit.

Prior to the Grand Prix, young Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna had won a special Race of Champions event where all the competitors were driving the Mercedes-Benz 190E&#x27;s against a host of former and current star drivers including Alain Prost, Carlos Reutemann, Denny Hulme, Phil Hill, Niki Lauda, Stirling Moss, James Hunt and Alan Jones. However, when the Grand Prix itself started, Senna had no such luck, triggering a first corner accident which took out the cars of Keke Rosberg, Marc Surer, Gerhard Berger, and Piercarlo Ghinzani. Senna&#x27;s Toleman (which had started 12th) had run into the back of Rosberg&#x27;s Williams under braking at the end of the main straight which caused the accident. Rosberg had started fourth (after blowing his Honda engine coming out of the final corner of his qualifying lap), but was slow off the line as his engine had suddenly developed a misfire.

After qualifying second on the grid, Alain Prost won the race in his McLaren from the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto and the Brabham-BMW of defending World Champion Nelson Piquet, with both the Ferrari and Brabham running out of fuel as they crossed the finish line. When they got out of their cars which stopped at the pit exit, Alboreto and Piquet raised their arms to each other in a gesture of frustration at FISA&#x27;s 220 litre fuel limit for turbos which had reduced races to economy runs.

Niki Lauda, who had almost lost his life in a fiery crash during the 1976 German GP, started 15th and finished 4th in his McLaren. In stark contrast to the lack of safety of the Nordschleife, Lauda gave the new GP-Strecke the thumbs up as a very safe Grand Prix circuit, saying that it was &quot;the perfect place to hold a Grand Prix&quot;.

<text>The 1984 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 21 October 1984. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1984 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was the first World Championship Portuguese Grand Prix since 1960, when it was held at the Boavista street circuit in Oporto.

Niki Lauda needed second place to secure the title, and gained it when Nigel Mansell spun out with 18 laps to go. As a result, he took the title by just half a point from team-mate Alain Prost. The point-scoring drivers won a total of 13 world championships between them, and the three drivers on the podium were all (at least) triple World Champions from different eras – Lauda, approaching the end of his long and distinguished F1 career, Prost, enjoying the best years of his career, and Ayrton Senna, still at the dawn of his.

After running a strong second behind Prost for most of the race, Mansell&#x27;s spin on lap 52 was due to his front left brake failing. The Englishman later told that as it was his last race for Lotus before joining Williams in , team boss Peter Warr (whom he had never got along with personally) had refused to give him the brakes he wanted for his Lotus 95T and that it was this that ultimately caused his retirement and handed Lauda the second place he needed to win the World Championship.

The race also represented the last win for French tyre manufacturer Michelin in Formula One until the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix.

<doc id="1122904" wikidata="Q1677543" url="?curid=1122904" title="Mardi Gras (album)">
<text>Mardi Gras is the seventh and final studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released on April 11, 1972 by Fantasy Records. Recorded after the departure of guitarist Tom Fogerty, it was the band&#x27;s only studio album as a trio, and featured songs written, sung, and produced by each of the remaining members, rather than just John Fogerty. The recording sessions were marred by personal and creative tensions, and the group disbanded after a short U.S. tour to support the album.

==Overview==
Unlike previous albums, on &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford shared songwriting and production duties with John Fogerty, and they also provided their own lead vocal contributions for the first time. Due to the quality of what resulted when Fogerty ceded some of his control over the band to the other members, Jon Landau opened his original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review with the statement: &quot;In the future, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; may be known as Fogerty&#x27;s Revenge.&quot; On October 16, 1972, six months after the release of the album, CCR and its record label, Fantasy Records, released a statement announcing the official disbanding of the group.

==Production==
Except for &quot;Sweet Hitch-Hiker&quot; and &quot;Door to Door&quot;, which were recorded in the spring of 1971, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; was recorded in January 1972. John&#x27;s older brother, Tom Fogerty, had departed the group in early 1971 following a dispute that was, in large part, caused by his desire to play a larger creative role and John&#x27;s insistence on being the band&#x27;s only singer/songwriter/business manager. John Fogerty only contributed three original songs to &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; and also sang lead on a fourth, a cover of the 1961 Ricky Nelson hit &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot;. According to Cook and Clifford, it was John Fogerty&#x27;s idea for all of the remaining members to contribute an equal number of new songs, despite their reservations. They believed he was bitter over Tom Fogerty&#x27;s departure and their own requests to have additional say in the group&#x27;s musical decisions, and that he was looking for an excuse to break up CCR to pursue a solo career. When Clifford and Cook at first demurred at the idea of having to supply two-thirds of the album&#x27;s material, they claimed John Fogerty threatened to quit the band, and that, when they agreed, he refused to contribute any vocals or instrumentation to their songs, except for guitar.

The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and going gold, and contained two Top 40 singles: &quot;Sweet Hitch-Hiker&quot; and &quot;Someday Never Comes&quot; (both of which written and sung by Fogerty), but mounting financial and legal woes compounded the fragile situation within the band, and CCR disbanded on October 16, 1972, shortly after the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; tour ended. In 1976, John Fogerty told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;I figured that Creedence made six albums. Let me count... the first one, &quot;Bayou Country&quot;, &quot;Green River&quot;, &quot;Willy and the Poor Boys&quot;, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;, &quot;Pendulum&quot;... yeah, six. I wouldn’t even count &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; and neither would anybody else. I had no control over anything after that. The rest is horse manure. Baloney.&quot;

==Reception==
Reviews for the album were mixed to poor, with Jon Landau writing in his May 25, 1972, review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that it was, &quot;relative to a group&#x27;s established level of performance, the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band.&quot; In a rare positive review, Gene Sculatti of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; praised John Fogerty&#x27;s performance on the record, but noted the absence of Tom Fogerty as a downside. He concluded: &quot;It may not be &quot;Green River&quot; or &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;, but &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; offers some of Creedence&#x27;s finest moments, and it&#x27;s a damn good answer to any and all of those &#x27;Rock is Dying&#x27; clowns.&quot;

&quot;Mardi Gras&quot; was not remastered and reissued on CD until 2000. A remastered version of the album was featured on the 40th anniversary CCR box set, but not as a stand-alone album. It was remastered and released on 180 Gram Vinyl by Analogue Productions in 2006. The album was re-released in remastered format as a Japan exclusive in January 2011.

<doc id="1122906" wikidata="Q838202" url="?curid=1122906" title="Expressive therapies">
<text>The expressive therapies are the use of the creative arts as a form of therapy, including the distinct disciplines expressive arts therapy and the creative arts therapies (art therapy, dance/movement therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, writing therapy, poetry therapy, and psychodrama). The expressive therapies are based on the assumption that people can heal through the various forms of creative expression. Expressive therapists share the belief that through creative expression and the tapping of the imagination, people can examine their body, feelings, emotions, and thought process.

==Definition and credentialing==
Expressive arts therapy is the practice of using imagery, storytelling, dance, music, drama, poetry, movement, horticulture, dreamwork, and visual arts together, in an integrated way, to foster human growth, development, and healing. Expressive arts therapy is its own distinct therapeutic discipline, an inter-modal discipline where the therapist and client move freely between drawing, dancing, music, drama, and poetry.

According to the National Organization for Arts in Health (NOAH), what distinguishes the six &quot;creative arts therapies&quot;—art, dance/movement, drama, music and poetry therapy as well as psychodrama—from &quot;expressive arts therapy&quot; is that expressive arts therapy interventions are designed to include more than one of the &quot;expressive&quot; art forms (art, dance, drama, music, poetry), whereas creative arts therapists, such as art, dance/movement, drama, music, poetry and psychodrama therapists, are often intensively trained and educated to use only one modality in their practice. But NOAH also acknowledged that the terms &quot;are often used interchangeably in the field&quot;, and that in any case all such professionals should collaborate closely.

The International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (IEATA) is the responsible organization handling the credentialing of expressive arts therapists.

The National Coalition of Creative Arts Therapies Association (NCCATA) connects all six modalities of the creative arts therapies. However, each modality of the creative arts therapies has its own national association that regulates professional credentials, establishes educational standards and hosts annual conferences for the purpose of exchanging new ideas and research.
== History ==

=== Early years ===
Margaret Naumburg, Edith Kramer, Hanna Kwiatkowska and Elinor Ulman have been credited with being the pioneers of the field of sensory art therapy. While all of these scientists made significant contributions, Margaret Naumburg has been hailed the &quot;Mother of Art Therapy&quot;. Her work focused on the use of art, mainly as a psychoanalytic diagnostic tool. It followed closely other psychoanalytic practices of the time, and was viewed as the communication of unconscious ideas and emotions that were being expressed by the patient.

== Modern approaches ==
Today&#x27;s art therapy is broken down into three different approaches: psychodynamic, humanistic, and learning and developmental. The psychodynamic approach uses terms such as &quot;transference&quot; and defense mechanism to describe why individuals express the art in the way they do, and why this is an expression of the subconscious. The humanistic approach is more of a positive psychology approach, and is defined by an optimistic view of humans, and how expression through their art allows them to take control over these emotions. The learning and developmental approach focuses on the art therapy as a method to assist children who have emotional and developmental disabilities.

==Education==
Each national association of the different modalities of expressive therapies sets its own educational standards. In the United States, there are a fair number of colleges that offer approved programs in compliance with the national associations&#x27; credentialing requirements.

There are 37 universities for music therapy, 34 universities for art therapy, seven universities for dance/movement therapy, and five universities for drama therapy, as well as 5 universities for expressive arts therapy, that have approved master&#x27;s degree programs in the United States. In addition, the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has 75 undergraduate music therapy programs approved. Once finished with an academic degree, potential therapists have to apply for credentialing at the responsible national association.

==Creative arts therapies modalities==
There are six creative arts therapy modalities, recognized by the NCCATA, including art therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, poetry therapy and psychodrama. In some areas, the terms &quot;Creative Arts Therapy&quot; and &quot;Creative Arts Therapist&quot; may only be used by those who are properly licensed, as is the case in the State of New York.

=== Art therapy ===
Created in the 1940s, Art therapy consists of the combination of psychotherapy and art. The creative process as well as the created art piece serves as a foundation for self-exploration, understanding, acceptance and eventually healing and personal growth. The creative act in therapy therefore can be seen as a means of re-experiencing inner conflict connected to resolution. The four main types are expression, imagination, active participation, and mind-body connection. Assisting in those with depression, breast cancer, and asthma, art therapy can be done at any age and does not require and skill set. Art Therapy has undergone extensive research which revealed that it decreases anxiety, increases self-concept and quality of life, and reduces negative thoughts. With two main goals in mind, Art Therapy strives to enhance personal and relational goals for those in need. Self-esteem, social skills, and cognitive functions are also said to be an area of importance. A certified art therapist is essential in order for the therapy to ensure improvement, however common art therapy using even a friend to discuss trauma can be enough to help someone.

=== Dance/movement therapy ===
Like other creative arts therapy modalities, dance/movement therapy is based on the assumption that &quot;mind, body and spirit are inseparable and interconnected&quot; (ADTA). Movement is the primary tool of intervention in a therapy session, but dance/movement therapy also uses the art of play in therapy. Like other creative art therapies it uses primarily nonverbal communication. Dance and movement therapy has shown to be the most beneficial in those who enjoy exercises that involve less talking an expression through movements.

=== Drama therapy ===

Drama therapy refers to the combination of the two disciplines drama/theatre and psychotherapy. Drama Therapy, as a hybrid of both disciplines, uses theater techniques to treat individuals with mental health, cognitive, and developmental disorders. Through the art of play and pretend, patients gain perspective in therapy to their life experiences, which in the field is referred to as &quot;aesthetic distance&quot;.
=== Music therapy ===

Music Therapy is the use of music, music-making, or other music-related interventions within a therapeutic relationship. Music therapy is a broad field with many areas and populations to specialize in. A holistic practice, music therapy can address emotional/psychological, cognitive, communication, motor, sensory, pain, social, behavioral, end of life, and even spiritual needs. This is due in part to music being processed in many areas of the brain. Music therapy helps patients &quot;communicate, process difficult experiences, and improve motor or cognitive functioning&quot; (Jenni Rook, MT-BC, LCPC, 2016). When used as psychotherapy, at its core, music therapy may use music as a symbolic representation and expression of the psychological world of the individual.

Townsend&#x27;s study in the &quot;Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines&quot; has shown that 1 in 5 children who lost their parent are most likely to develop a psychiatric disorder. This finding underscored the significance of instructors to initiate writing on the subjects of &quot;death&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; in academic writing. One of the few ways to bring this into practice is through music-making or songwriting.

Songwriting allows individual to process the trauma they experience in their life in three ways: By telling stories that have been passed down to them; by connecting their songs to cultural traditions; and by sharing their feelings with each other and their community. Songwriting is a way to organize a narrative. Through forming a coherent story, an unpleasant or chaotic situation can be made more approachable.

Deroo&#x27;s research focuses on the Black teenage girl, Noriah, who wrote the song named &quot;Air I Breathe&quot; in remembrance of her passing mother and sister. Through Noriah&#x27;s story, Deroo tries to find the answer to how can youths tackle the nuanced implications of loss using creative expression. Noriah&#x27;s experience shows that there can be many therapeutic possibilities with songwriting. By using eulogies in her songs, Noriah is able to communicate her bond with her lost ones through lyrics. As demonstrated with the composition of &quot;Air I Breathe&quot;, while the memories of Noriah and her departed would eventually fade, &quot;Air I Breathe&quot; serves as a permanent reminder for Noriah to keep in mind the memories. During a speech in the university classroom, Noriah expressed her purpose in writing the song. “I wrote a song about the loss of my little sister and biological mother, back to back, and so much love I had for them, and what I couldn&#x27;t get out. It was a way to get out the rest of the feeling that I had—telling that story to you directly, but I could sing it instantly. It was like a form of therapy” (Deroo).

In addition, writing and sharing about lost can benefit the community who then can learn from the experiences that were previously private. As Ryden argues, audiences embrace the story as if they are their own, making meaning of the experience in their own ways. This idea was further demonstrated through the interaction between Noriah and Wendy. Being inspired by Noriah&#x27;s song, Wendy entered the room with her own experience of loss.
Music Therapy also benefits a variety of disorders, like cardiac and mental disorders. It aids those who suffer from depression, anxiety, autism, substance abuse, and Alzheimer&#x27;s. In cases where a person is suffering from mental disorders, music relieves stress, improves self-esteem, etc. Evidence has shown that people who have used Music Therapy in the past have improved in several aspects of life that do not concern just those suffering from mental illness. In music therapy, people may improve their singing which may then impact their ability to speak. Therefore, it can change several aspects of life, not just those of helping mental illness.

=== Poetry therapy ===
Poetry therapy (also referred to using the broader term &quot;bibliotherapy&quot;) stands out from other creative arts therapies, which are all based on the assumption of the existence of a language that functions without words. Poetry therapy, however, is the use of the written word to bring healing and personal growth. For instance, &quot;To, The Bravest Person I Know&quot; is one of the classic illustrations of how to use poetry to overcome anxiety, depression (mood), and other sorts of insecurity.

In Manning&#x27;s research about high school poetry classes, he found that through poetry classes, students are able to reimagine their struggles as a source of strength, develop a sense of possibility, and build bonds that empower them to speak through the silence that surrounded their life struggles. Manning advocated the need for opportunities for creative expression in classroom spaces. Not only would this practice encourage youth to express themselves authentically using their own words in an environment where their voice is constrained by school literacy, but it would also contribute to positive changes to the current school environment by honoring students&#x27; voices and life experiences.

=== Psychodrama ===
Psychodrama is a distinct form of psychotherapy developed by Jacob L. Moreno in the early 20th century. Moreno, a trained psychiatrist himself, had the goal of creating a more effective, action-based form of psychotherapy. Later it was modified by other authors according to Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung. He developed a clear three phase structure (warm up, action, sharing) to his therapy as well as multiple intervention-methods that are still used by psychodrama therapists today.

Although related, psychodrama and drama therapy describe different modalities within the field of creative arts therapies. Whereas psychodrama uses real-life experience of the patients in therapy to &quot;practice new and more effective roles and behaviors&quot; (ASGPP), drama therapy lets the patients explore more fictional stories, such as improvised scenes, myths or fairy tales.

== Benefits ==

=== Self-discovery ===
* This discovery often leads to a relief of emotional tension caused by past events, and can be used as a coping mechanism.
* Given the ability to claim your own story, which helps with personal affirmation.

=== Empowerment ===
* Expressive therapy gives individuals the ability to articulate their fears and stresses in a non-conventional way, and often leads to sense of control over these emotions.

=== Stress relief ===
* Effective for stress relief by itself, but can provide even better results if paired with other relaxation devices such as guided imagery.
* Expressive therapy provides individuals with a foundation on which they can recognize and confront pain.

=== Physical pain relief and rehabilitation ===
* Expressive therapy has been shown to help decrease pain in patients who are recovering from illness and injury. It has also been used in patients who are chronically or terminally ill, to provide relief and pain control.

== Empirical evidence ==

=== Ball (2002) ===
Ball conducted long-term research on five children who were considered to be severely emotionally disturbed. These children participated in 50 art therapy sessions, and the results suggested that the art therapy was successful, and the children showed marked progress in their treatment over the course of the 50 sessions.

=== Pifalo (2006) ===
In this study, 41 girls or young women who had been sexually abused were given structured group art therapy for eight weeks, and were measured before treatment using the Briere&#x27;s Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). They were given the test again after the treatment, and for 9 out of 10 of the girls, a statistically significant reduction in scores on the test were observed.

=== Bar-Sela, Atid, Danos, Gabay &amp; Epelbaum (2007) ===
This study worked with 60 adults who had cancer. These adults attended weekly individual art therapy, in addition to watercolor painting classes. After just four sessions, the experimental group saw marked and significant improvement in depression and fatigue, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a brief fatigue inventory. While they showed a decrease in depression, there was no significant difference in the levels of anxiety of the patients.

=== Gusak (2006) ===
In this study, the researcher worked with 29 incarcerated men. The men attended eight sessions of group art therapy, and were tested before and after the treatment using the Beck Depression Inventory Short Form. After the eight sessions, all of the men showed significant improvement in the symptoms of depression and their score on the Beck Depression Inventory reflected these improvements.

=== Bulfone et al. (2009) ===
In this study Bulfone et al. utilized music therapy as their treatment. 60 women who had been diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. The control group received standard assistance before chemotherapy, while the experimental group had the chance to listen to music before the chemotherapy began. The results showed that the anxiety levels of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group, and also showed a significantly lower level of depression.

==Applications==
===Expressive writing therapy in virtual setting (2024)===
Virtual settings have expanded the reach of expressive writing therapy. A study on intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors demonstrated that online writing sessions in a structured environment significantly reduced trauma symptoms, providing a safe and accessible space for emotional processing.

<doc id="1122912" wikidata="Q54407" url="?curid=1122912" title="1985 Brazilian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1985 Brazilian Grand Prix (officially known as the XIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held at Jacarepaguá in Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro on 7 April 1985. It was the first round of the 1985 Formula One World Championship, and marked the 13th edition of the Brazilian Grand Prix as a round of the World Championship since its inception in 1950.

Alain Prost, driving for McLaren was the defending race winner heading into the race. In qualifying, Ferrari driver, Michele Alboreto took pole, his second of his career. In the race, he would finish second on the podium behind eventual race winner, Prost while Elio de Angelis rounded out the podium in the Lotus car. Of note, even though René Arnoux finished 4th for Ferrari, he was sacked after the race, with both the team and Arnoux never revealing the reason behind the sacking. The driver who finished 7th in this race, Stefan Johansson, was picked up by the Scuderia for the rest of the year. This race was also Nigel Mansell&#x27;s first race of seven seasons with the Williams team.

==Background==
The 1985 Formula One season saw an entry list of 28 drivers competing with Zakspeed officially joining Formula One with Jonathan Palmer as their driver, though they wouldn&#x27;t be competing in the opening round as they were going to join the field in Portugal (Zakspeed competed only in the European races that season for economic reasons). The other brand new team that was competing in the 1985 season was Minardi who had competed in Formula Two from 1980 to 1984 with a custom chassis before stepping up and competing in F1. The Toleman team, meanwhile, missed the race due to being unable to secure a tyre contract. Their lead driver, Stefan Johansson, was present, however, and substituted for Stefan Bellof when the German driver was suspended by his Tyrrell team due to a contract dispute.

The opening round in Brazil was the first round of the 1985 championship, this was the 14th edition of the Brazilian Grand Prix since its inception in 1972. It&#x27;s also the 13th time that a Formula One World Championship had been held there with the 1972 edition being a non-championship race. The race was held at the Jacarepaguá circuit which held its first Grand Prix in 1978 and had been holding the Grand Prix since 1981.

==Qualifying==
Qualifying for the 1985 Brazilian Grand Prix was held in two sessions with one being held on the Friday and the other being held on the Saturday. In the Friday session, Lotus who did some aerodynamic tweaks to the car similar to the Lola&#x27;s new Indycar as they went to the top of the timesheets on Friday morning. But for Elio de Angelis he wouldn&#x27;t be able to improve on his time with de Angelis responding after the second qualifying session, &quot;I am sure I could have retained the pole.&quot; Senna would improve on his lap time but only slightly as he finished behind de Angelis on the grid in fourth.

On the front row of the grid, Michele Alboreto would claim the first pole position of the season with a time of 1:27.768, a full one second ahead of his time on the Friday. Alboreto team-mate in Rene Arnoux also improve his time by a second. But had to start the race in seventh place with Arnoux needing to use the spare car after the Ferrari engine was down on power on his main car. Also on the front row of the grid was Keke Rosberg in the Williams-Honda who earlier in the weekend had a blown turbo from their engine on the Saturday morning. But one flying lap secured Rosberg a front row start with team mate Nigel Mansell starting from fifth.

McLaren also has engine issues with the attempts of trying to do a qualifying boost not being able to run properly with the two drivers eventually starting in sixth (Alain Prost) and ninth (Niki Lauda) on the grid. Eighth on the grid was the first of the Pirelli&#x27;s with Brabham driver, Nelson Piquet being the quickest. The designer of Brabham, Gordon Murray advised that their winter testing had been for the best race tyre and not for taking any pole positions in the first few races of the season. Rounding out the top ten was Renault driver, Derek Warwick who was 2.3 seconds off the pace. His team-mate, Patrick Tambay who started behind him in 11th advised that Renault was &quot;four seconds behind the pace when we first tested the car here a month ago. Now it had been reduced to two seconds.&quot;

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
The race temperature for the race was a degree day as the driver&#x27;s had line-up. Before the race, Prost finished fastest in the warm-up session ahead of Alboreto and Lauda rounding out the top three. When the race began, the front row made a perfect start with Rosberg just edging out Alboreto into the first corner with the other Williams car in Mansell also getting off to a great start. He would get behind Alboreto before a bump on the rear wheel would see him go to the outside of the turn and off the racing line. This incident would end his race a few laps later with body damage issues.

This race marked the 17th Grand Prix won by Alain Prost, moving him ahead of Stirling Moss as the Formula 1 driver with most race wins among those without a Drivers&#x27; Championship. Four more wins would follow throughout the year and Prost would extend the record to 21, at which point he clinched his first title and handed the record back to Moss.

<text>The 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held in Estoril on 21 April 1985. It was the second round of the 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship and was won by Ayrton Senna from pole position, taking both his first pole position and win in the process. Senna demonstrated his proficiency in wet racing by finishing the race at least one lap ahead of every car except second-place finisher Michele Alboreto.

==Race==
Jonathan Palmer was the first driver to retire and was able to bring his Zakspeed into the pits and retire with suspension problems. Wet weather caused spinouts frequently early in the race. Philippe Alliot retired trackside for this reason on lap 3. François Hesnault retired trackside with an electrical problem on the same lap.

On lap 4, Riccardo Patrese made contact with Stefan Johansson while attempting to pass him on the inside line. Running 10th and 11th at the time, both cars were spun out into a gravel trap by the contact. Patrese was beached, and Johansson was able to rejoin the race after a delay, several positions down. Soon after, Stefan Bellof and Manfred Winkelhock made contact on track; both were able to restart their cars and rejoin the race. Numerous other small offs and spinoffs continued through the wet conditions.

By lap 10, Ayrton Senna had pulled away from 2nd position by almost 13 seconds. Elio de Angelis, Alain Prost, and Michele Alboreto (in order) were closely contending second position, and Derek Warwick was 15 seconds behind them in 5th. Gerhard Berger and Pierluigi Martini both spun off and retired on lap 12. The top four held steady to lap 15, with Niki Lauda and Patrick Tambay in 5th and 6th, 25 seconds behind 4th place Alboreto. Keke Rosberg spun his car on track on lap 16, and it came to rest in the middle of the track, causing a local yellow. Rosberg&#x27;s car was not immediately cleared and remained on track in the same position for numerous laps.

At 20 laps, Senna had extended his lead on his teammate de Angelis to 30 seconds, with Prost and Alboreto still close behind. The two Renaults of Tambay and Warwick were more than a minute behind Senna in 6th and 7th. Only 9 cars remained on the lead lap. Nelson Piquet pitted repeatedly around lap 25, finally retiring with a tyre issue. Rain, which was already falling at the start of the race, continued and got heavier. Near lap 30, Mauro Baldi spun out and ended on track with damage to his car and leaving a lot of mud on the racing surface, and Alain Prost retired with damage after spinning and striking the rear of his car on the track barrier. Still in the lead, Ayrton Senna signaled to race officials along pit lane asking them to stop the race. The race was not stopped or interrupted, but did continue at an unusually slow pace because of the poor weather conditions.

The 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 70 laps. At the beginning of lap 67, race leader Ayrton Senna was given a &quot;one lap to go&quot; indication from the race director, as the race had exceeded the prescribed two-hour time limit. Senna crossed the line, having led every lap of the race, and with only one other car on the lead lap, that of second-place Michele Alboreto. Patrick Tambay and Elio de Angelis, both one lap down, took third and fourth. Nigel Mansell and Stefan Bellof took the final points-paying positions, two laps down.

Senna&#x27;s win was his first of two in the 1985 Formula One season, and the first of what would be 41 Formula One Grand Prix victories.

<text>The 1985 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 5 May 1985. It was the third race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship. The 60-lap race was won by local driver Elio de Angelis, driving a Lotus-Renault, after McLaren driver Alain Prost had been disqualified for being underweight. It was de Angelis&#x27; second and last win. Thierry Boutsen was second in an Arrows-BMW, with Patrick Tambay third in a factory Renault.

===Qualifying report===
Before the previous race in Portugal it was revealed that René Arnoux had been fired by Ferrari, with no explanation ever given for his sudden departure by either the team or Arnoux. In his place was Swedish driver Stefan Johansson. Arnoux was in the pits at Imola, but was seen with the Brabham team, starting a false rumor he would soon join the team alongside Nelson Piquet. As it turned out, Arnoux would not drive in F1 again until joining Ligier in .

Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Renault with a time of 1:27.327, with Keke Rosberg alongside him on the front row in the Williams-Honda. For Senna it would be the first of seven consecutive pole positions at Imola, a run which ended in 1992.

Filling the second row were Elio de Angelis in the second Lotus and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari. Belgian Thierry Boutsen was a surprise 5th fastest in the Arrows-BMW, ahead of the McLaren-TAG of Alain Prost. In his second race for Ferrari, Johansson qualified 15th.

Limited fuel allowances played a big part in the race, as a succession of drivers ran out of fuel in the last few laps. Prost took the chequered flag before stopping on the slowing-down lap and hitching a ride with Patrick Tambay on the side pod to return to the pits. Later, Prost&#x27;s car was found to be two kilograms underweight in post-race scrutineering, resulting in his disqualification. Summing up the general feeling that FISA&#x27;s fuel limit rules had seen Formula One races reduced to mere economy runs, Williams driver Nigel Mansell noted that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t really racing&quot;.

Stefan Johansson ran a good race in his second drive for Ferrari. After starting 15th he steadily made his way through the field and by late in the race had moved to second (benefiting from others running out of fuel) and was poised to benefit from Senna also running dry 3 laps from home. Johansson took the lead from the Lotus to a thunderous applause from the Italian fans, only to run out of fuel himself half a lap later coming out of the Acque Minerali chicane. A post race examination of his car revealed the Ferrari had an electrical malfunction that caused the engine to use more fuel than the readout was telling the team or Johansson. The Ferrari&#x27;s readout had told Johansson that he still had enough fuel to finish the race.

Prost&#x27;s disqualification promoted de Angelis to the win, his second in F1, with second place awarded to Boutsen — who ran out of fuel as he reached the start-finish straight on his final lap and pushed his Arrows across the finish line to secure his finishing position — and third to Frenchman Patrick Tambay, in what would turn out to be the last podium finish for both Tambay and the original factory Renault team. Mauro Baldi and Spirit Racing entered their last Grand Prix: the small British team were having financial troubles and the Toleman team offered to buy out their tyre contract: Spirit accepted and withdrew from the championship, allowing Toleman to race for the rest of the season.

<text>The 1985 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 19 May 1985. It was the fourth race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship.

The 78-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG. Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Renault and led until he suffered an engine failure on lap 14. Michele Alboreto finished second in a Ferrari, with Elio de Angelis third in the other Lotus-Renault.

After the race, de Angelis led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by two points from Prost and Alboreto.

==Summary==
As usual for the time, the FIA allowed only 20 cars to start the race, due to the tight confines of the Monaco circuit. The Toleman team entered their first race of the season, having missed the opening three rounds due to not having tyres. Having bought out the tyre contract of the struggling Spirit team, Toleman were able to race for the rest of the season. This was the first race in which they were sponsored by the Benetton clothing company, who would buy the team and rename it Benetton Formula from 1986 onwards.

There was a big accident on the pit straight involving Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese, this accident was to affect the outcome of the race. The accident happened right after Piquet and Patrese crossed the start/finish line, Piquet attempted to pass Patrese, the two cars touched and Patrese crashed violently and collected Piquet, whose Brabham&#x27;s rear suspension broke during the collision before Patrese collected Piquet. The cars then spun into the run-off at the first corner at Sainte Devote; both drivers were unhurt. Patrese&#x27;s gearbox dropped oil onto the track which took out Niki Lauda who while sliding off on the oil managed to avoid hitting anything, he stalled his engine and was out on the spot. The crash also nearly took out the closely following Jacques Laffite and Teo Fabi, while race leader Michele Alboreto also slid wide on the oil; Alboreto&#x27;s off handed the lead to Alain Prost. Alboreto drove a hard race; he eventually caught and passed Prost 3 laps later, but was re-passed by Prost after he punctured his left rear tyre at the first corner where Piquet and Patrese crashed. This dropped him to 4th behind Andrea de Cesaris, Elio de Angelis and Prost; he caught and passed his compatriots but could not catch Prost; who despite a leaking turbo wastegate, had kept the gap wide enough for Alboreto to be unable to catch him in the remaining laps.

<text>The 1985 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal on 16 June 1985. It was the fifth race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship.

The 70-lap race was won by Italian driver Michele Alboreto, driving a Ferrari, with Swedish teammate Stefan Johansson second and Frenchman Alain Prost third in a McLaren-TAG. The win gave Alboreto the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by five points from Prost and fellow Italian Elio de Angelis, who finished fifth in his Lotus-Renault having started from pole position, while Ferrari took the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
Qualifying saw Elio de Angelis take pole position in his Lotus by just under three-tenths of a second from teammate Ayrton Senna, with the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson immediately behind them on the second row. Alain Prost was fifth in his McLaren, with Derek Warwick sixth in the factory Renault. The top ten was completed by Thierry Boutsen in the Arrows, Keke Rosberg in the Williams, Nelson Piquet in the Brabham and Patrick Tambay in the second factory Renault. Reigning World Champion Niki Lauda could only manage 17th in the second McLaren, one place behind Nigel Mansell in the second Williams.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
===Race report===
At the start, de Angelis led away from Senna and Alboreto. Warwick made a fast start to run fourth, before suffering handling problems. On lap 6 Senna pitted with a turbo problem, losing five laps in the process. Alboreto then closed up to de Angelis, before passing him for the lead on lap 13. In mid-race, Johansson also passed de Angelis to set up a Ferrari 1-2, while Lauda retired with an engine failure after a &quot;disappointing weekend.&quot; Alboreto eventually took the chequered flag 1.9 seconds ahead of Johansson, with Prost and Rosberg moving into third and fourth respectively in the closing laps, and de Angelis having to settle for fifth, ahead of Mansell. Johansson had to contend with an intermittent misfire and when he got too close to Alboreto, the team leader simply turned up the turbo pressure and pulled away. Both de Angelis and Prost had to slow down considerably so as to not run out of fuel (with Prost having to stop almost immediately after crossing the finishing line).

<text>The 1985 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Paul Ricard on 7 July 1985. It was the seventh race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship. It was the 63rd French Grand Prix and the ninth to be held at Paul Ricard. The race was held over 53 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of .

The race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Brabham-BMW, his only victory of the season. It was the 35th and final Formula One victory for the Brabham team, as well as the first F1 victory for Italian tyre manufacturer Pirelli since . Finn Keke Rosberg finished second in a Williams-Honda, having started from pole position, with local driver Alain Prost third in a McLaren-TAG. Prost moved to within five points of Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Italian Michele Alboreto, who retired on lap 6 with a turbo failure in his Ferrari.

This was to be the last French Grand Prix held on the full Paul Ricard circuit until 2018. A shorter, circuit would be used from 1986 until 1990, following Elio de Angelis&#x27;s fatal accident during a test session in May 1986.

==Qualifying report==
Qualifying saw Keke Rosberg take pole position in his Williams-Honda with a time of 1:32.462, averaging , with Ayrton Senna alongside him on the front row in his Lotus-Renault. On the second row were Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari and Alain Prost in the McLaren, and on the third were Nelson Piquet in the Brabham and Niki Lauda in the second McLaren. Completing the top ten were Elio de Angelis in the second Lotus, Gerhard Berger in the Arrows, and the two factory Renaults of Patrick Tambay and Derek Warwick, Tambay driving a &#x27;B&#x27; specification of the RE60.

Rosberg&#x27;s Williams teammate, Nigel Mansell, had set a time good enough for eighth on the grid when he had a high-speed crash at the Signes corner, located at the end of the long Mistral Straight. A puncture caused the car to plunge off the track at over and into catch fencing; one of the poles struck Mansell on the head, giving him a concussion which forced him to miss the race.

The race was also the first in which the Tyrrell team used Renault turbo engines, thus becoming the last F1 team to go over from naturally aspirated engines to turbos. However, only Martin Brundle drove the new Renault-powered 014 car, while teammate Stefan Bellof continued to use the Cosworth-powered 012. Brundle could only qualify 20th, but was still over four seconds faster than Bellof in 25th. After qualifying, Brundle described one lap coming onto the Mistral about 50 metres behind Bellof in the Cosworth car (with Bellof also on a quick lap), and by the time the 014 got to Signes, the older car was just a dot in his mirror. While only running the oldest and slowest of the available Renault turbo engines, Brundle was speed trapped at , significantly faster than Bellof in the non-turbo who could only reach .

During qualifying, Marc Surer in his Brabham BMW recorded a seasons high on the 1.8 km (1.1 mi) long Mistral Straight.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the start, Rosberg led away from Senna and Piquet, while Prost slipped to eighth. The early laps saw both Ligiers retire, Jacques Laffite suffering a turbo failure on lap 3 and Andrea de Cesaris dropping out with steering problems two laps later. Alboreto also suffered a turbo failure on lap 6 while running fourth.

On lap 7, Piquet overtook compatriot Senna on the Mistral Straight. He then closed up to Rosberg, who was struggling for grip, before passing him for the lead at Beausset on lap 11. At the same time, Lauda and Prost moved up to third and fourth respectively, ahead of de Angelis. On lap 21, Berger collided with the Minardi of Pierluigi Martini, putting both drivers out.

Senna, who had dropped down the order due to gearbox problems, retired in dramatic fashion on lap 27, when his engine failed and oil from it leaked onto his rear tyres, causing him to spin off backwards into the catch fencing and crash massively at Signes. He escaped with bruises, while his Lotus caught fire. Lauda retired on lap 31 when his own gearbox failed, promoting Prost to third; Brundle also suffered a gearbox failure on lap 33.

On lap 38, by which time Piquet had extended his lead to over 20 seconds, Prost overtook Rosberg for second at the Verrerie bends. The Finn promptly pitted for new tyres, emerging in fourth behind de Angelis. He then made a charge, quickly passing the Lotus and setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 46, before retaking second from Prost on the final lap.

Up front, Piquet cruised to victory, taking the chequered flag 6.6 seconds ahead of Rosberg. Prost finished 44 seconds ahead of the second Ferrari of Stefan Johansson, who passed de Angelis for fourth on the final lap, with Tambay taking the final point for sixth.

<text>The Protective Policing Service (), operated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, provides security details for domestic and foreign VIPs when abroad.

==History==
In October 2022, concerns were raised that the RCMP has not recruited enough officers to provide close protection work, undermining RCMP&#x27;s capabilities to protect VIPs. 

Under a 2022-23 Departmental Plan, the RCMP PPS will move to a centralized model to provide enhanced oversight/compliance.

In May 2023, the RCMP is given more funding to establish more close protection units for politicians, depending on risk assessment.

==Organisation==
PPS operations consist of RCMP officers, assisted by civilian and public servants who specialise in intelligence analysis, geospatial analysis and technological expertise.

A number of RCMP close protection units include the Governor General Protective Detail, the Prime Minister Protective Detail and the Divisional Protective Services.

==Duties==
RCMP officers in PPS operations are responsible for protecting the following VIPs:

* Royal Family (when in Canada)
* Canadian Governor General
* Prime Minister. 
* Members of Parliament and Senators
* Foreign diplomats in Canada, 
* Supreme, Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal justices
* Other persons designated by Minister of Public Safety as protected persons.

==Training==
Prospective RCMP officers are placed under the National Close Protection Officer Course as of March 2022.

==Provincial counterparts==
Many provinces have a similar organization that is responsible for the protection of the provincial Lieutenant-Governor, the Premier, other members of the provincial cabinet, and members of the judiciary.

* : Alberta Sheriffs Branch
* : Royal Newfoundland Constabulary
* : Ontario Provincial Police
* : Sûreté du Québec
* Quebec also have protection for ministers, opposition leaders and other high level officials by the DPP (Direction de la Protection des Personalités) which is a division of the MSP (Ministère de la Sécurité Publique du Québec)

<text>The 1985 British Grand Prix (formally the XXXVIII [[Marlboro]] British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 21 July 1985. It was the eighth race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship.

The 65-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, after he started from third position. Michele Alboreto finished second in a Ferrari, with Jacques Laffite third in a Ligier-Renault. The win, Prost&#x27;s third of the season, moved him to within two points of Alboreto at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

== Report ==

Silverstone, a circuit located on a former World War II airfield located between London and Birmingham in England was known for being the fastest circuit used by Formula One; it was even faster than Monza and the Österreichring. The circuit&#x27;s layout back then was quite different and simpler compared to the current layout used from 2010 onwards. Silverstone alternated the British Grand Prix with Brands Hatch and each circuit would host it every 2nd year.

Qualifying saw Keke Rosberg underline Silverstone&#x27;s incredibly high speed laps by taking pole in his Williams with a lap of 1:05.591. At an average speed of 160.9 mph (259 km/h), it stood as the fastest qualifying lap in F1 history for 17 years. Alongside Rosberg on the front row was Nelson Piquet in the Brabham, while Alain Prost in the McLaren and Ayrton Senna in the Lotus were on the second row. Nigel Mansell in the second Williams and championship leader Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari filled the third row, while on the fourth were Andrea de Cesaris in the Ligier and Elio de Angelis in the second Lotus. Teo Fabi in the Toleman and Niki Lauda in the second McLaren completed the top ten.

At the start of the race, Senna made a superb start and passed Prost, the slow-starting Piquet and Rosberg to take the lead, while Mansell moved up to third and de Cesaris to fifth. Behind them, four cars were eliminated at the first corner, Copse, as Patrick Tambay in the Renault lost control and was hit by the second Ferrari of Stefan Johansson, which also caused the Osella of Piercarlo Ghinzani and the RAM of Philippe Alliot to crash into each other.

Back at the front, de Cesaris passed Prost and then Mansell to be third, before Prost repassed the Ligier on lap 9. Prost later admitted he was apprehensive about being behind the Ligier thanks to the unpredictable de Cesaris&#x27; reputation for crashing. Mansell dropped out on lap 18 with a clutch failure, before team-mate Rosberg suffered a broken exhaust four laps later. Senna continued to lead, with Prost now second and Lauda up to third ahead of de Cesaris, Piquet and Alboreto. Prost and Lauda&#x27;s McLaren-TAG/Porsche MP4/2B&#x27;s performance through high-speed corners was far superior to that of any other car competing that year – something that was a feature of all of the original Silverstone&#x27;s 8 corners (10 if the 3-turn sequence of the Woodcote chicane is counted).

Alboreto passed Piquet for fifth, before moving up to fourth on lap 42 when de Cesaris&#x27;s clutch failed. By then, Senna and Prost were running nose-to-tail. The Frenchman finally passed the Brazilian on lap 58, Lauda&#x27;s electrics failing on the same lap. Then Senna&#x27;s fuel injection failed, promoting Alboreto to second, while Jacques Laffite in the second Ligier moved up to third ahead of Piquet.

The chequered flag was erroneously shown at the end of lap 65, one lap early, with Prost having lapped the entire field. Halfway around what was meant to have been the final lap, Laffite ran out of fuel, which annoyed Piquet – he would have thus taken the final podium place had the error not been made. The final points were taken by Derek Warwick in the second Renault and Marc Surer in the second Brabham.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Prost moved to within two points of Alboreto, while in the Constructors&#x27; Championship McLaren moved up to second, 18 points behind Ferrari.

<text>The 1985 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 4 August 1985. It was the ninth race of the 1985 Formula One season.

This was the first German Grand Prix that was held on the new GP-Strecke section of the track that replaced the old Südschleife section that had not been used since 1970. It was also the first time in nine years the German GP was held at Nürburgring; previously the German Grand Prix had been held on the Nordschleife configuration until 1976, after which the Grand Prix was moved to the Hockenheimring, following Niki Lauda&#x27;s near-fatal accident at the 1976 German Grand Prix. The GP-Strecke would not host another Grand Prix until the 1995 European Grand Prix, and would not host the German Grand Prix again until the 2009 edition.

Michele Alboreto won the race, his fifth and last Formula One victory. This event was the first occasion on which an onboard camera was used in a race; on François Hesnault&#x27;s Renault car. That car was not eligible for championship points, and this race marked the last time that an F1 team entered more than two cars for a race.

As it was the German Grand Prix (and that the team still only had 1 new car built) Tyrrell team boss Ken Tyrrell gave his German driver Stefan Bellof use of the Renault powered Tyrrell 014 for the weekend instead of the car&#x27;s usual driver Martin Brundle, who was given Bellof&#x27;s Cosworth powered 012 to drive. To get around a FISA rule stating that a team and driver could not run more than 2 engines in the one chassis during a season (with the 012 running the Cosworth and 014 the Renault), Tyrrell simply switched the drivers from one car to the other but not their car numbers, meaning Bellof drove in car #3 and Brundle in car #4. Bellof qualified the turbo powered car 19th while Brundle was 26th and last with the Cosworth V8, some 10.2 seconds of Fabi&#x27;s pole time and 6.4 seconds slower than his teammate in his usual car, something Brundle was reported to be not happy with. This was to be the last Grand Prix for Manfred Winkelhock: the German fatally crashed his Porsche 962C sportscar at the 1000 km of Mosport in Canada the following week. His son Markus would make his F1 debut 22 years later, on the same track.

As of 2024, Alboreto&#x27;s win remains the last for an Italian driver driving for Ferrari in Formula One.

===Qualifying===
Pole position went to Teo Fabi, the first of his career and the only pole for the Toleman team. He set his pole time during the Friday qualifying session; rain on Saturday meant that none of the drivers could improve their times.

<text>The 1985 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 18 August 1985. It was the tenth race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship. It was the 25th Austrian Grand Prix and the 24th to be held at Österreichring. The race was run over 52 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of .

The race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, after he started from pole position. Prost took his fourth victory of the season by 30 seconds from Brazilian Ayrton Senna in a Lotus-Renault, with Italian Michele Alboreto third in a Ferrari. With the win, Prost moved level on points with Alboreto at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

This was the last F1 race until the start of in which a car with a naturally aspirated engine was entered, Martin Brundle failing to qualify his Cosworth-powered Tyrrell.

== Race summary ==
Missing from the grid was RAM driver Manfred Winkelhock who had been killed in a sportscar race in Canada just a week before. His place was taken in the team by Kenny Acheson for his first Formula One race since the 1983 South African Grand Prix.

A second Toleman was driven by Piercarlo Ghinzani.

Before Saturday morning practice triple and defending World Champion (and 1984 Austrian Grand Prix winner) Niki Lauda, flanked by a very unhappy McLaren team boss Ron Dennis, announced to the media that he would be retiring for good from Formula One following the season ending to concentrate on running his airline Lauda Air. Dennis was reportedly unhappy as he had paid Lauda a considerable amount of money to make his F1 comeback in and he had unsuccessfully tried to get Lauda to continue racing into the season.

A now relaxed Lauda gave his home fans something to cheer about when he qualified a season-high third. Lauda&#x27;s team mate Alain Prost captured pole position, averaging 155.478 mph (250.219 km/h), followed by Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda), Lauda, Keke Rosberg (Williams) and Nelson Piquet (Brabham-BMW). After a troubled qualifying, Ayrton Senna only qualified 14th on the grid in his Lotus-Renault.

The race was restarted after one lap (with Niki Lauda having made a great start from third on the grid to lead Prost as the race was stopped). Mansell had got away very slowly in his Williams, but behind him Teo Fabi in the Toleman-Hart barely moved. Elio de Angelis&#x27; Lotus dived left to avoid Fabi and was hit by the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto. Fabi suffered damage as did the Arrows-BMW of the second Austrian driver in the race Gerhard Berger. Luckily for those with damaged cars (especially championship leader Alboreto) the first lap was declared null and void and the race was completely restarted meaning those with damaged cars were permitted to start in the team spares. Lucky too was Prost who was able to change cars after his McLaren had developed a misfire. Piercarlo Ghinzani became a non-starter in his Toleman after team mate Fabi took over the spare TG185 for the race as he had qualified 6th while Ghinzani started 19th. This left Ghinzani without a drive.

On lap 13 Andrea de Cesaris survived one of the biggest and most spectacular crashes ever seen in Formula One when his Ligier-Renault went off-line at the left hand Panorama Curve and slid onto the outside grassy embankment at high speed. The grass, wet from overnight rain caused the Ligier to initially slide sideways before his right rear hit a slight bank launching the car into a series of 4 consecutive mid-air rolls and flips with de Cesaris&#x27;s head bouncing around freely in the cockpit. Somehow as soon as the Ligier came to a rest, de Cesaris undid his seat belt and walked away with nothing more than a mud-splattered helmet and driving suit. When he returned to the pits, the Ligier team had not yet seen a replay of the accident, and de Cesaris told the team that the car had stalled and wouldn&#x27;t restart. However, the crash was the end for de Cesaris at Ligier, with team owner Guy Ligier firing the Italian after he saw a replay of the crash stating &quot;I can no longer afford to keep employing this man&quot; referring to the constant repair bills from de Cesaris&#x27;s crashes since he joined the team in . de Cesaris was fired from Ligier after he raced for the team at the Dutch Grand Prix one week later.

With his 20th career victory, Prost moved into a shared lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship alongside Alboreto, with each having 50 points. After a string of non-finishes since his win in the second race of the season in Portugal, Senna drove a great race into second from a lowly (for him) 14th on the grid, with Alboreto finishing third in the spare Ferrari to retain his lead in the World Championship (now shared with Prost). Stefan Johansson (Ferrari), Elio de Angelis, and Marc Surer (Brabham), completed the points-scoring finishers.

<text>Bruhathkayosaurus (; meaning &quot;huge-bodied lizard&quot;) is a controversial genus of sauropod dinosaur found in the Kallamedu Formation of India. The fragmentary remains were originally described as a theropod, but it was later determined to be a titanosaurian sauropod. Length estimates by researchers exceed those of the titanosaur &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, as longer than and weighing over 80 tonnes. A 2023 estimate placed &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; as potentially weighing approximately , with paleontologist Michael Benton, giving &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; a length of . If the upper estimates of the 2023 records are accurate, &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; may have rivaled the blue whale as one of the largest animals to ever exist. However, all of the estimates are based on the dimensions of the fossils described in Yadagiri and Ayyasami (1987), and in 2017, it was reported that the holotype fossils had disintegrated and no longer exist.

== Discovery and naming ==

The holotype of &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot;, GSI PAL/SR/20, was discovered around 1978 near the southern tip of India, specifically in the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu, northeast of Kallamedu village. It was recovered from rocks of the Kallamedu Formation, which are dated to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago. The fossilized remains include hip bones (the ilium and ischium), partial leg bones (femur and tibia), a forearm (radius) and a tail bone (part of a vertebra, specifically a platycoelous caudal centrum). The remains were originally classified as belonging to a carnosaurian theropod by Yadagiri and Ayyasami in 1987 (not 1989, as some sources indicate). The generic name chosen, &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot;, is derived from a combination of the Sanskrit word &quot;Bruhathkaya&quot; (&quot;bṛhat&quot; , &#x27;huge, heavy&#x27; and &quot;kāya&quot;, काय &#x27;body&#x27;), and the Greek &quot;sauros&quot; (lizard). The specific epithet, &quot;matleyi&quot;, honours British palaeontologist Charles Alfred Matley, who discovered many fossils in India.

The monsoon season, combined with the sands and clays of the Kallamedu Formation, creates water-saturated fossils which are very friable. During the dry season, expansion during the day and contraction during the night can cause fossils to split apart. This results in poorly preserved bones that can be impossible to extract without damage. In 2017, Galton and Ayyasami reported that the &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; fossils started to disintegrate inside their field jackets before reaching the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and no longer exist.

== Classification ==
&quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; was originally classified as a carnosaur (like &quot;Allosaurus&quot;), of an uncertain position (&quot;incertae sedis&quot;). However, Chatterjee (1995) re-examined the remains and demonstrated that &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; is actually a titanosaur sauropod. Some later studies listed &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; as an indeterminate sauropod or as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

The original publication described little in the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by a few line drawings and photographs of the fossils as they lay in the ground. This led to online speculation by researchers that the bones might actually have been petrified wood, akin to the way the original discoverers of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; initially believed their find to be fossilized tree trunks. A 2022 review by Pal and Ayyasami presented additional previously unseen photographs of the tibia bone at the excavation site and in a plaster jacket, and reinforced the taxon&#x27;s position within Titanosauria. However, as Mohabey and colleagues noted in 2024, &quot;this new information has not resolved the identity of the element nor the validity of the taxon.&quot;

== Size estimates ==
According to the published description, the shin bone (tibia) of &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; was long. This is 29 percent larger than the fibula of &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, which is only long. The fragmentary femur was similarly huge; across the distal end, it measured , 33% larger than the femur of &quot;Antarctosaurus giganteus&quot;, which measures . The ilium measured in length. 

No total body size estimates for &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; have been published, but paleontologists and researchers have posted tentative estimates on the Internet. In a post from June 2001, Mickey Mortimer estimated that &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; could have reached in length and might have weighed , but in later posts retracted these estimates, reducing the estimated length to based on more complete titanosaurs (&quot;Saltasaurus&quot;, &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot; and &quot;Rapetosaurus&quot;), and declined to provide a new weight estimate, describing the older weight estimates as inaccurate. In a May 2008 article for the weblog &quot;Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week&quot;, paleontologist Matt Wedel used a comparison with &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; and calculated the weight of &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; at up to . In 2019, Gregory S. Paul suggested that the supposed tibia was probably a degraded femur, in which case its length was slightly greater than that of &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot; (1.91 meters) and &quot;Futalognkosaurus&quot; (1.98 meters). Its ilium is similar in length to that of &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot; whereas the width of the distal femur appears to slightly exceed that of &quot;Patagotitan&quot;. Paul estimated its mass at around , much lower than any previous estimation. In 2020, Molina-Perez and Larramendi suggested that the long tibia is probably a fibula, and estimated the size of the animal at and .

By comparison, the titanosaur &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; is estimated to have reached in length, and to have weighed 65–100 tonnes. These sauropods are known only from partial or fragmentary remains, so the size estimates are uncertain. Length is calculated by comparing existing bones to the bones of similar dinosaurs, which are known from more complete skeletons and scaling them up isometrically. However, such extrapolation can never be more than an educated guess and the length of the tail, in particular, is often hard to judge. Determining mass is even more difficult because little evidence of soft tissues survives in the fossil record. In addition, isometric scaling is based on the assumption that body proportions remain the same, which is not necessarily the case. In particular, the proportions of the titanosaurs are not well known, due to a limited number of relatively complete specimens.

If the upper size estimates for &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; are accurate, it would even rival the size of the largest recorded blue whale. Mature blue whales can reach in length, and the record-holder blue whale was recorded at , with estimates of up to .

Another poorly known sauropod that shares similar size estimates to &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; is &quot;Maraapunisaurus fragillimus&quot;, which is based on a now-missing dorsal vertebra. In 2006, Kenneth Carpenter used &quot;Diplodocus&quot; as a guide and estimated &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot; to be in length and weigh only about . In 2018, however, Carpenter estimated &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot; to be in length based upon comparisons with rebbachisaurids. In 2019, Paul gave a higher estimation of and a weight of .

Paul and Larramendi (2023) suggested that &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; may have weighed within the range of , though they stated that it would have likely weighed between . Whilst its most liberal estimate was 240 tons when scaled with &quot;Patagotitan&quot;, they considered any estimate over to be unlikely. Nevertheless, Paul stressed that the idea of these &#x27;super-sauropods&#x27; or &#x27;land-whales&#x27; aren&#x27;t as far-fetched as one would think given the long period of sauropod existence as well as their very efficient body-plan (i.e. small heads, large body, efficient ventilated air-sacs, strong and flexible muscle and bone structure, and large source of static food), indicating that the existence of 150+ ton sauropods such as &quot;Bruhathkayosaurus&quot; and &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot; are in the realm of possibility.

<text>The 1985 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Zandvoort on 25 August 1985. It was the eleventh round of the 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship and the 34th World Championship Grand Prix to be held in the Netherlands. The race was held over 70 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a race distance of 298 kilometres. The race also proved to be the 25th and final Grand Prix victory for triple World Champion Niki Lauda, driving a McLaren-TAG. Lauda&#x27;s teammate Alain Prost was second, with Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna third in his Lotus-Renault. However, it was also to be the last Dutch Grand Prix for 36 years. It was planned to be re-introduced in 2020, on a revised Zandvoort circuit, however the re-introduction was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which would be eventually cancelled. The first race back at Zandvoort eventually turned out to be in 2021, won by Max Verstappen, the nation&#x27;s first World Champion. Verstappen would later go on to win the 2022 and 2023 editions of the race, until the streak was broken when Lando Norris won the race in 2024.

It was also the last Grand Prix for West German Stefan Bellof, who was killed the following week at the 1000 km of Spa World Sportscar race.

== Race summary ==

Renault&#x27;s Patrick Tambay, who qualified sixth, had a huge crash at nearly in the Sunday morning warm-up following a suspension failure on the start-finish straight. Tambay escaped shaken but unhurt, and took the start in the spare car.

Nelson Piquet recorded his first and only pole position of the season, averaging , the first for tyre manufacturer Pirelli. However, he stalled his Brabham at the start and was eventually push-started, almost a lap behind the leaders. He eventually finished eighth.

Niki Lauda took his 25th and final Grand Prix win in his McLaren-TAG. His teammate Alain Prost finished second, only 0.232 seconds behind; the two had diced for the lead over the final twelve laps of the race. Ayrton Senna continued his late-season charge by finishing third in his Lotus, albeit 48 seconds behind the McLarens; he finished just ahead of Prost&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari. Senna&#x27;s teammate Elio de Angelis was fifth, with Williams&#x27; Nigel Mansell taking the final point for sixth.

Following his car destroying crash at the previous race in Austria, this was also the last time Andrea de Cesaris appeared in a Ligier. It would in fact be the Italian&#x27;s last race of the season.

<text>The 1985 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 8 September 1985. It was the twelfth round of the 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was the 55th Italian Grand Prix and the 50th to be held at Monza. The race was held over 51 laps of the 5.8-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 295.8 kilometres.

The race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost driving a McLaren MP4/2B. It was Prost&#x27;s fifth and final victory of the 1985 season as he powered towards the first of his four Formula One world championships. Prost won by almost 52 seconds over the Brazilian duo Nelson Piquet (Brabham BT54) and Ayrton Senna (Lotus 97T).

It was the debut race for the American owned Haas Lola team with their new car, the Lola THL1 running the Hart 415T turbocharged engine, driven by Australia&#x27;s World Champion Alan Jones. Jones, who had retired following the season, was making a full-time return to Formula One after two races, the US Grand Prix West, and the non championship Race of Champions with Arrows in early .

Missing from the grid was popular West German driver Stefan Bellof who was killed a week earlier in a World Sportscar Championship race at the Spa Circuit in Belgium. With his funeral set for the day after the Italian Grand Prix the Tyrrell team only ran the one car for Martin Brundle feeling it would be disrespectful to Bellof to bring a driver in to replace him for the race. Members of the Tyrrell team, including team boss Ken Tyrrell, attended Bellof&#x27;s funeral the next day.

Senna&#x27;s pole position is often cited as one of his greatest moments.

<text>Easy Listening for Iron Youth: The Best of NON is a 1991 compilation album of Boyd Rice&#x27;s NON recordings. It is a &quot;best of&quot; collection from 1975–1991.

It was released by Mute Records (UK) on CD and an ultra-limited LP (without tracks 14–16).

==Personnel==
Boyd Rice wrote all tracks except &quot;Predator/Prey&quot; (by Rice and Coil) and &quot;Cleanliness And Order&quot; (by Rice and Daniel Miller). Percussion was provided by Michael Moynihan, Tony Wakeford, Douglas P., and Rose McDowall on &quot;Conflagration&quot;, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;, and &quot;Sunset&quot;.

==Liner notes==
Vlad the Impaler is pictured on the front cover feasting among his victims.

&quot;History proves that man is a beast of prey. The beast of prey conquers countries, founds great realms by subjugation of the other subjugators, forms states and organizes civilizations in order to enjoy his booty in peace... Attack and defence, suffering and struggle, victory and defeat, domination and servitude, all sealed with blood; this is the entire history of the human race...&quot; — Richard Wagner

&quot;There is a demon in man that should be exercised, not exorcised&quot; — Anton Szandor LaVey

&quot;The sounds that issue forth from the recordings of Boyd Rice (a.k.a. NON) have been known to cause anxiety attacks and even physical illness in the faint of heart and weak of mind. The bold and adventurous few however, will find this music to be pure balm. This swirling vortex of sound is mood music, pure and simple; like some soundtrack to a frenzied blood-letting at the foot of the mongol steppes. There is no better tonic I know for today&#x27;s true connoisseurs of that stimulating region that exists one step beyond good and evil.&quot;— Adam Parfrey, editor of &quot;Apocalypse Culture&quot;

==Dedication==
This recording is respectfully dedicated to history&#x27;s men of steel: Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Vlad the Impaler, Hassan Sabbah, Nero, Anton Szandor LaVey, Roi D&#x27;Ys, Jack the Ripper, Marquis de Sade, the hero of Green River, Ghengis Khan, Diocletian, Charles Manson &amp; Ayahtolla Khomeni. May their spirit live forever.

<text>The 1985 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 15 September 1985. It was the thirteenth round of the 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was the 43rd Belgian Grand Prix, the 31st to be held at Spa and the second since the circuit had been rebuilt and re-opened at half its original length in 1979. The race was held over 43 laps of the seven kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 301 kilometres.

The race was won by Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna driving a Lotus 97T. It was Senna&#x27;s second World Championship victory and the first of five he would win at Spa-Francorchamps. Senna won by 28 seconds over British driver Nigel Mansell driving a Williams FW10. Third was World Championship points leader, French driver Alain Prost driving a McLaren MP4/2B. The win promoted Senna to third in the drivers&#x27; standings and third place allowed Prost to expand his lead over Ferrari driver Michele Alboreto to 16 points.

Originally scheduled to take place on 2 June 1985, the Grand Prix was rescheduled for September after the recently resurfaced track became damaged during the race weekend.

=== Track surface and postponement ===
This was the second Belgian Grand Prix to occur at a reconfigured Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, with the first being the 1983 race. Race organisers opted to resurface the track with a material called Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer that intended to provide improved grip in wet-weather conditions at a cost of £3 million. Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), the governing body of Formula One, was queried about the resurfacing work and replied it would approve if race organisers complied with a regulation that mandates any such work occur 60 days beforehand. Local bureaucracy and a harsh winter caused delays to the work, which were reportedly finished ten days before the event&#x27;s scheduled date of 31 May, and forced a cancellation of a pre-race test session at the circuit. Organisers did not refer the incident to the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile and went ahead.

Warm weather, the powerful turbocharged cars of the time, and their wide, slick tyres, damaged the track during the Friday practice session. Repairs to the circuit were conducted overnight and undamaged turns were also addressed. After around 25 minutes into the Saturday practice session, all on-track activity stopped, since drivers noticed the damage and held a series of meetings. One suggestion was to cancel the remainder of the day&#x27;s activities, the Sunday morning warm-up session and enter straight into the race on Sunday afternoon. Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder of Formula One, called every team principal to a meeting and told them to hold the International Formula 3000 support round on Sunday afternoon or it be the primary event. Drivers and officials inspected the track at 18:00 local time. Discussions continued until 19:30 local time and drivers&#x27; representative Niki Lauda told the media that the Formula One race would be postponed.

Jean-Marie Balestre, the president of FISA, was furious and summoned race organisers to the FISA executive meeting in Paris &quot;to explain the serious fault committed,&quot; and said that they &quot;will be liable to very heavy sanctions.&quot; The Belgian ASN was fined $10,000 and a provisional $100,000 bond to be deposited to FISA by the organisers would be returned in the event there were no further problems with the track on the rescheduled date. Ecclestone rescheduled the race to 15 September, following the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and the European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. The race at Brands Hatch was later moved back by one week to provide the teams with some preparation.

=== Postponed race ===
Because this was a rescheduled race Formula One&#x27;s newest team Haas Lola and their driver, World Champion Alan Jones, who had their first race at the previous round in Italy were not permitted to enter as they were not on the original entry list. During the buildup to the race FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that the controversial South African Grand Prix would take place despite pressure to cancel the event as part of anti-apartheid embargoes.

Missing from the grid was an injured Niki Lauda. At the end of Friday&#x27;s practice session before qualifying proper, his McLaren MP4/2B&#x27;s throttle stuck open while he was only touring back to the pits. The car slid off the track on the newer section of track and the three time and defending World Champion hit a guardrail and on impact the steering wheel whipped around wrenching his wrist as it did so. X-rays revealed no break but Lauda was not fit to race so he returned home to Austria for further inspection and treatment from his physical therapist Willi Dungl. McLaren initially hoped to put John Watson in Lauda&#x27;s car but this would have required the approval of all other teams. Mindful of the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari refused to agree, leaving Alain Prost as McLaren&#x27;s only driver in Belgium. RAM was also down to one car, only bringing a single RAM 03 for Philippe Alliot and the 1985 Formula 3000 champion Christian Danner made his world championship debut with Zakspeed.

Prost took pole position, averaging 135.929 mph (218.756 km/h) from Senna with Nelson Piquet qualifying third in his Brabham BT54, with Alboreto fourth in his Ferrari 156/85. Rain fell before the race leaving the grid to form on a damp track with wet-weather tyres for the first time since Senna won in Portugal. Senna won the start from Piquet but the Brabham spun at the first corner. Senna led from Prost, Mansell and the two Ferraris of Alboreto and Stefan Johansson. The Ferraris were soon out, from a broken clutch and engine respectively. Meanwhile Johansson retired after spinning off at the end of the Kemmel Straight on Lap 8. Prost dropped behind the two Williams FW10s as the field pitted for dry tyres. Late in the race rain fell again and Senna expanded his lead. Keke Rosberg dropped to fourth with a brief pit visit with a brake problem and they finished in that order. Fifth had been Thierry Boutsen until his Arrows A8 broke its gearbox. Piquet claimed fifth from Derek Warwick in a Renault RE60B, Warwick scored the last point for the original factory Renault team. Twelve cars finished the race, including for the first time a Minardi as Pierluigi Martini finished twelfth in his Minardi M185. A further two cars, Boutsen and the crashed Ligier JS25 of Jacques Laffite were also classified as finishers. Huub Rothengatter&#x27;s Osella FA1G fell one lap short of being classified.

Although the marshals led the cars directly into the pits after finish, Ayrton Senna drove around them and took a lap of honour.

<text>The 1985 European Grand Prix (formally the Shell Oils Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch on 6 October 1985. It was the fourteenth race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship.

The 75-lap race was won by Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. It was Mansell&#x27;s first Formula One victory in his 72nd race start. Ayrton Senna finished second in a Lotus-Renault, having started from pole position, while Mansell&#x27;s teammate Keke Rosberg finished third. Alain Prost finished fourth in his McLaren-TAG which, combined with Michele Alboreto&#x27;s retirement with a turbo failure, secured the Frenchman his first Drivers&#x27; Championship.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
Ayrton Senna took his sixth pole position of the season in his Lotus-Renault, averaging , the first time anyone had lapped the Brands Hatch circuit faster than 140 mph. Compatriot Nelson Piquet was second in his Brabham-BMW, 0.3 seconds behind, followed by the Williams-Hondas of Nigel Mansell and Keke Rosberg. Philippe Streiff was a surprise fifth in his Ligier, ahead of Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren; the top ten was completed by Marc Surer in the second Brabham, Derek Warwick in the Renault, Elio de Angelis in the second Lotus and Jacques Laffite in the second Ligier. Prost&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Michele Alboreto, could only manage 15th in his Ferrari.

Prost&#x27;s teammate Niki Lauda was unfit to race due to the wrist injury he had suffered at the previous race in Belgium. His place was taken by former McLaren stalwart John Watson, in his first F1 race since the end of ; the Ulsterman qualified 21st, over five seconds behind Senna. Watson&#x27;s participation marked the last time to date a Formula One driver raced with number 1 without having been World Champion the previous season. Tyrrell had re-expanded to two cars, with Martin Brundle joined by Italian newcomer Ivan Capelli, who qualified 24th.

===Race report===
Senna led off the line from a fast-starting Mansell, while Prost slid onto the grass and fell to 14th. Mansell then ran wide at Druids, allowing Rosberg and Piquet past.

On lap 7, Rosberg attempted to overtake Senna, but the Brazilian blocked the move causing Rosberg to spin at Surtees Corner and was unavoidably hit by Piquet in third. The Brabham was out on the spot with a broken front suspension, while Rosberg limped back to the pits with a puncture, losing a full lap in the process. Mansell was now second again, followed by de Angelis, Stefan Johansson in the second Ferrari and Surer, with Prost up to seventh following a charge through the field. When Rosberg exited the pits, he rejoined in front of the leaders. An aggrieved Rosberg blocked Senna (who he felt was responsible for the earlier incident). Rosberg cleverly positioned his car which allowed teammate Mansell to catch up to the Lotus before getting past at Surtees. Rosberg then allowed Mansell through, and the Englishman then set about building a lead, while Rosberg continued to hold up Senna.

On lap 14 Alboreto, who had made a good start and had run as high as sixth, suffered a fiery turbo failure, effectively ending his Championship challenge. Prost, running sixth at this point, now only needed to finish fifth to secure the title. Surer had moved ahead of Johansson by this stage and was closing on de Angelis, while Laffite was also on a charge, passing Prost and Johansson in quick succession.

Surer overtook de Angelis on lap 21, followed soon after by Laffite. The two then closed up to Senna, Surer getting past on lap 35 and Laffite one lap later. At this point, Mansell&#x27;s lead was 14 seconds, while Prost was still seventh.

On lap 51, having just been re-passed by Senna, Laffite pitted for new tyres, dropping to eighth and promoting Johansson to fourth. Shortly afterwards, Prost passed de Angelis for fifth as the two were lapping Watson; this became fourth when Johansson started to suffer an electrical problem. Laffite retired on lap 59 with an engine failure, followed one lap later by Johansson.

Surer was still running second when on lap 63, he suffered a turbo failure similar to Alboreto&#x27;s. This left Mansell around 20 seconds clear of Senna, with Prost now third, de Angelis fourth and Rosberg back up to fifth. Rosberg soon passed de Angelis before Prost, taking no chances, allowed the Finn through into the final podium position.

Up front, Mansell cruised to his first Formula One victory, his final margin over Senna being 21.4 seconds. Rosberg finished 37 seconds behind Senna and eight ahead of Prost, who celebrated becoming France&#x27;s first Formula One Drivers&#x27; Champion. De Angelis and the Arrows of Thierry Boutsen rounded out the top six, Boutsen holding off Watson for the final point in what would turn out to be the Ulsterman&#x27;s last F1 race.

<text>The 1985 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 19 October 1985 at the Kyalami Circuit in South Africa. It was the fifteenth and penultimate round of the 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The race was marked with some teams boycotting the event due to apartheid – the segregation of blacks and whites – and was the last South African Formula One race until apartheid ended in 1992. The race was won by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Honda, who also took pole position.

==Report==
Until the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, this was the last World Championship Grand Prix to be held on a Saturday,; it also was the last World Championship Grand Prix where laurel wreaths were given to the drivers at the podium. The event was boycotted by two teams, Ligier and Renault, owing to mounting international pressures against tolerating the country&#x27;s system of apartheid. A state of emergency had been declared by the South African government in July due to growing civil unrest nationwide, and French teams Ligier and Renault&#x27;s boycotts were in lockstep with the French government&#x27;s boycott and sanctioning of South Africa, apparently doing so under pressure. Most of the Formula One drivers, including Alain Prost, Niki Lauda and Nigel Mansell were personally very much against racing in South Africa, but the drivers held the mentality that because they were contracted to drive at every Grand Prix, they would race at Kyalami.

Some governments tried to keep their drivers from entering the race. Brazil&#x27;s sanctions on South Africa nearly prevented Nelson Piquet or Ayrton Senna from racing.

Finland and Sweden held similar reservations regarding Finn Keke Rosberg and Swede Stefan Johansson competing. Sweden&#x27;s National Automobile Federation had announced Johansson could not race in South Africa before the event, but he did race.

Ayrton Senna initially said he would race if Lotus raced. However, he later said he would boycott the race.

Multiple sponsors also ordered teams to remove their branding from cars they backed, most notably Marlboro and Beatrice Foods.

The latter held an equity interest in the single car Haas Lola team. While Alan Jones qualified 18th for that team, his car was not on the starting grid. Officially Jones cited illness as to why he did not race, but it was widely rumored at the time that Beatrice ordered the team to boycott. In 2017, Jones described a meeting with Bernie Ecclestone the night before the race, who suggested that Jones feign illness the next morning and not show up. Ecclestone described how Beatrice were under pressure in the US from activists such as Jesse Jackson not to race, under threats including strike action by African Americans working in their businesses. Only Jones and team management Teddy Mayer and Carl Haas were aware of this plan. Jones said &quot;And so, on the Saturday morning I was gone. I just didn’t turn up. They had the car out ready to go, when they were told, &quot;AJ’s been struck down by a virus and we are not racing&quot;.&quot;

It was the final South African Grand Prix until apartheid ended, with FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announcing days after the race that the Grand Prix would not return to the nation for 1986 because of apartheid. Even without the political pressures, this might well have been the final Formula One race held at Kyalami in its then form: FISA had long since deemed that circuits where lap times were under 60 seconds were considered too small for Grand Prix racing and with car speeds increasing all the time, it was reasonable to conclude that lap times from would be under 60 seconds. Kyalami&#x27;s pole position time had actually fallen by over 10 seconds since the 1981 race, and Mansell&#x27;s 1985 pole time of 1:02.366, at an average speed of , was over two and a half seconds faster than Nelson Piquet&#x27;s 1984 pole time of 1:04.871.

During qualifying, the Brabham BMWs reached on the 1.65 km (1.0 mi) long front straight, just shy of their season&#x27;s best at Paul Ricard in France some 3 months earlier.

The South African Grand Prix would only return in 1992, after apartheid ended, in a new configuration of the Kyalami circuit. Mansell would also win the 1992 race driving a Williams, albeit with a naturally-aspirated Renault engine.

<doc id="1122941" wikidata="Q7440059" url="?curid=1122941" title="Sea denial">
<text>Sea denial is a military term for preventing an enemy from using the sea. It is a naval warfare subset of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies, and does not necessarily mean that the denier itself will use the sea. It is a parallel concept to sea control, which implies that that controlling force cannot be successfully attacked. 

Vego describes sea denial as &quot;preventing partially or completely the enemy’s use of the sea for military and commercial purposes&quot;. 

Corbett states that the object of sea denial is defensive. It is a less ambitious strategy than sea control and is often carried out by a weaker power. It is possible to pursue sea denial in one area of operation while pursuing sea control in another. 

Sea denial can act as a direct complement to sea control. A nation may achieve sea control in its littorals, while enforcing sea denial outside the littorals, as was seen with the Soviet Union during periods of the Cold War.

== Methods ==
Sea denial is achieved in many different ways. The method depends on factors such as geography, ambition, and capabilities. Geographically it is easier to conduct sea denial operations in choke points such as narrow waters, straights, or congested waters. 

Example techniques include naval mines, anti-ship missiles, drones, and submarines. 

Barrier operations seek to hinder access to certain areas. Commerce raiding requires the enemy to put resources into escorting merchant ships. Asymmetrical warfare can involve attacking expensive ships with low cost uncrewed vessels. A fleet in being can threaten offensive operations without actually conducting them.

== History ==
During World War I and World War II, Germany pursued sea denial using U-boats. Owing to the substantial superiority of the Royal Navy&#x27;s surface forces, Germany&#x27;s Imperial Navy (in World War I) and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (in World War II) had little hope of sea control, but with submarines, the Germans hoped to choke off their access to seaborne commerce. In both wars, the United Kingdom successfully resisted the German strategy with a combination of strict rationing and anti-submarine weapons and techniques. 

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union invested heavily in submarines and would likely have pursued a similar strategy of sea denial had tensions with NATO escalated to open warfare.

Since World War II, the most notable example of a sea denial involved the so-called &#x27;Tanker War,&#x27; wherein Iran and Iraq sought to close the Persian Gulf.

Today the term A2/AD has gained traction, and refers to a sort of sea denial strategy where a state aspires to challenge access to certain areas while hindering freedom of movement in an adjacent area. It can include a combined effort of navy, air force, and army. The army deploys missiles and sensors. The air force deploys assets to gather intelligence, conduct surveillance and reconnaissance and target ships with airborne weaponry. The navy deploys sea mines, surface ships, and submarines in a layered defence and distributed lethality.

Modern sea denial addresses area denial weapons, for example in the context of a land power using land-based missiles to strike sea targets. Such missiles can follow cruise missile (terrain-skimming) or ballistic missile trajectories.

<text>The 1985 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on the Adelaide Street Circuit in Adelaide on 3 November 1985. The sixteenth and final race of the 1985 Formula One World Championship, it was the 50th running of the Australian Grand Prix and the first to be held on the streets of Adelaide on a layout specifically designed for the debut of the World Championship in Australia. The race was held over 82 laps of the 3.780 km (2.362 mi) circuit for a total race distance of 310 kilometres. The race was won by Keke Rosberg driving a Williams-Honda; this was the final win for Rosberg, the last race for Alfa Romeo until 2019, and the last by a Finnish driver until Mika Häkkinen won the 1997 European Grand Prix.

==Pre-race==
The new Adelaide Street Circuit was received extremely positively with glowing reviews from those within the paddock despite the circuit&#x27;s temporary nature as it wound through streets, parkland and across horse racing venue Victoria Park Racecourse immediately adjacent to the Adelaide central business district, with the drivers enjoying a street circuit that was unlike Monaco and Detroit with their endless short straights, narrow roads and hairpin or right angle corners. The Adelaide circuit was wide and fast in places, and included a 900-metre long straight (named the &quot;Brabham Straight&quot; for Australia&#x27;s three-time World Champion Jack Brabham) where the faster cars reached over . The reception for the track, and the professional way in which the event was organised and executed was sufficiently positive to see the promoters awarded the Formula One Promotional Trophy for 1985.

Dual World Champion Nelson Piquet confirmed the drivers&#x27; positive view on the circuit when he said early in race week &quot;After Dallas and Las Vegas, we all expected another bad street circuit&quot;, while his Brabham team boss and head of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) Bernie Ecclestone told the assembled media that he believed that the standard of the organisation and the circuit itself was bad news for Formula One, explaining that Adelaide had raised the standards of what would be expected in the future and that several tracks in Europe already on the calendar, or hoping to be, would have to lift their own games in order to match it. Over the course of the weekend, the only complaint from the drivers was of a lack of grip on the newly laid surface (along with the new road built inside the Victoria Park Racecourse which is where the pits were located, the entire circuit other than the Brabham Straight had been re-laid a few months prior to the race to prevent the problems often faced on American street circuits where the road surface broke up badly under the strain of the high powered cars). The new surface was causing graining in both qualifying and race tyres. Other than a bump in the road at the end of the Brabham Straight, the circuit itself was generally given the thumbs up by those that really mattered, the teams and their often highly paid drivers.

The only Australian driver in the field, World Drivers&#x27; Champion Alan Jones who was driving the Haas Lola team&#x27;s Lola THL1-Hart, was given the honour of driving the first Formula One car out onto the new circuit when first practice opened at 10am on the Thursday morning (standard practice at the time was to give an extra day&#x27;s practice at a new circuit, though the meeting starting on the Thursday with just the support categories became a feature of the AGP in Adelaide). Bernie Ecclestone had arranged for Jones to do a lap of the track before any other cars were released from the pits. Jones also had the honour of having a section of track named after him, with the Rundle Road section of the track, a 350-metre straight between turns 9 and 10, renamed as the &quot;Jones Straight&quot; when the circuit was in use. Jones Straight led directly onto the fast Brabham Straight.

==Qualifying==
Official qualifying became a battle royal between the Williams-Hondas of World Champion Keke Rosberg and his teammate Nigel Mansell, and the Lotus-Renault of Ayrton Senna. Rosberg took the honors on Friday with a lap of 1:22.402, only 0.001 faster than Senna, with Mansell a further 0.161 back in third. During final qualifying, Mansell looked to have pole position wrapped up with a lap of 1:20.537 in his Williams FW10, with Senna second with Rosberg another three-tenths further back in third. Senna was out on his third run with only minutes left before the end of qualifying in his black and gold Lotus 97T, powered by a special Renault qualifying engine rumored to be putting out some , and stunned everyone with a time of 1:19.843, seven-tenths faster than Mansell, to grab his 7th pole position of the season. As such, Senna was the only driver to record a time under 1:20- and he went out again but could not get anywhere near that time again.

World Champion designate Alain Prost was 4th on the grid in his McLaren TAG-Porsche, the Ferrari of 1985 World Championship runner up Michele Alboreto fifth, and Marc Surer in his Brabham-BMW rounding out the top six qualifiers. Outgoing World Champion Niki Lauda was 16th on the grid in his McLaren. Alan Jones ended up 19th on the grid after engine and turbo problems throughout practice and qualifying.

The slowest qualifier for the race, Huub Rothengatter in the Osella-Alfa Romeo, was 10.473 seconds slower than Senna with a time of 1:30.319. With only 25 cars appearing for the race (the RAM and Zakspeed teams did not contest the last two races of the season - indeed RAM would never race Formula One again), all cars that attended qualified for the start.

==Race==
The race of high attrition, which was run in heat, was won by Rosberg driving the Williams-Honda; it would turn out to be the last victory (and last fastest lap) of his Formula One career. Rosberg was the only front running driver to finish strongly and one of only eight cars to be classified. It was the fifth and final Grand Prix win of Rosberg&#x27;s career and confirmed his status as a street race specialist with three of his previous four wins being on the streets of Monaco (1983), Dallas (1984), and Detroit earlier in the 1985 season. Rosberg had some technical problems which could have lost him the race, his race engineer, Frank Dernie suggested a strategy to minimise loss of time. Rosberg gave the winner&#x27;s trophy to Dernie.

On the penultimate lap, Ligier-Renault driver Philippe Streiff tried to overtake his senior team-mate Jacques Laffite for second place and, as result of this manoeuvre, Streiff&#x27;s front wheel axle was severely damaged. With fourth placed Ivan Capelli a lap down in his Tyrrell-Renault, Streiff managed to limp his Ligier JS25 home and retain third place despite having only three wheels firmly attached to the car, with the front left wheel bouncing up and down over the course of the last lap, but somehow remaining attached to the car. It would remain a career best finish for Streiff. Ligier team boss Guy Ligier, not impressed that Streiff had almost taken out both team cars at the end of the race when they were both assured of a podium finish, would not offer the Frenchman a drive for . It turned out to be Streiff&#x27;s only career podium.

A delayed Stefan Johansson finished fifth in his Ferrari ahead of Gerhard Berger in his Arrows-BMW. Berger at that stage of his career was also a part-time factory touring car driver for BMW in the European Touring Car Championship (he had won the Spa 24 Hours for BMW&#x27;s Schnitzer Motorsport in July 1985). He performed double duty during the AGP weekend, also driving a BMW 635 CSi during the Group A support race. This was actually a breach of Formula One&#x27;s driver rules which stated a driver must not drive another type of race car or in another motor race within the 24 hours before the start of a Grand Prix. As the Group A race was scheduled to start on the Saturday afternoon one hour after F1 qualifying had finished, Berger had to obtain permission from FISA, FOCA, and his Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver to race the BMW. As it turned out, his touring car race lasted 3 laps before he was punted into the gravel trap at the end of the pit straight by the Holden Dealer Team Commodore of John Harvey. The only other race finishers were Huub Rothengatter (Osella) and Pierluigi Martini (Minardi), both of whom were four laps behind Rosberg. Martin Brundle&#x27;s Tyrrell was running at the end, but Brundle was 33 laps down on Rosberg and was not classified as a finisher.

Renault had a largely forgettable weekend in their last Grand Prix as a manufacturer (until ). Patrick Tambay, whose Renault RE60B was fitted with an on-board camera during practice and qualifying, qualified 8th while Derek Warwick qualified in 12th place. After Friday&#x27;s qualifying, Tambay visited Adelaide&#x27;s major dirt track racing venue Speedway Park which was hosting the inaugural Australian Sprintcar Masters meeting and while there turned a few laps of the ¼ mile clay oval track in a V8 Sprint Car. Warwick did the same thing on the Saturday night of the two night meeting. However, unlike Berger in the Group A race, Warwick did not have permission to drive the winged sprint car within the 24 hours before the race time period and was hit with a hefty fine by the governing body FISA (despite Warwick only driving a few laps and not actually racing). In their last race both Renaults retired with transmission failure, Tambay on lap 21 and Warwick on lap 58.

All 25 cars present qualified for the race. With RAM Racing (who pulled out of F1 altogether after the European Grand Prix) and Zakspeed (who only ran the European races in 1985) not making the journey to Australia, there would not be a cut-off based on grid numbers. Early in the race Elio de Angelis, driving in his last race for Lotus, was disqualified for regaining his original grid position after being delayed on the parade lap. de Angelis later confessed that in the heat of the moment he simply forgot the rules.

The race was the 100th World Championship start for 1980 World Champion Alan Jones. Jones (along with Alain Prost) was one of two drivers to have won the Australian Grand Prix previously (Jones in 1980 and Prost in 1982). Jones&#x27; Lola retired on lap 21 with failed electrics following a typically fiery drive through to 6th place after stalling at the start and being dead last at the end of the first lap, while Prost retired with engine failure on lap 27. It was also the last race for outgoing world champion Niki Lauda. His McLaren ended in the fence with damage to the front left after a brake failure at the end of the long Brabham Straight.

Fittingly Lauda&#x27;s career ended while he was in the lead of a Grand Prix. Lauda and race winner Rosberg were the only drivers in the field who had actually competed in the non-championship 1984 Australian Grand Prix which was held for Formula Pacific cars. Lauda had also failed to finish the 1984 race while Rosberg had finished second behind Brazilian Roberto Moreno.

Both Alfa Romeo and Renault had their last Grand Prix as a constructor in the turbo era. As of , Alfa have never returned to Grand Prix racing as a factory team; the Alfa team that competed in F1 from 1982 to 1985 was actually a pseudo-factory team actually run by EuroRacing with support from the Alfa factory, and the Alfa team that competed in F1 from 2019 to 2023 was a rebranded Sauber with Alfa Romeo providing technical assistance with the hope that Alfa Romeo will be a works team in the near future. Renault would return in following their purchase the Benetton team. It was also the last Grand Prix for the Toleman team under the Toleman name. The team would continue in but would be renamed Benetton after being purchased by their main sponsors, the Italian clothes manufacturer Benetton Group. All six cars (the Alfa Romeo 184TB&#x27;s of Riccardo Patrese and Eddie Cheever, the Renault RE60B&#x27;s of Patrick Tambay and Derek Warwick, and the Hart powered Toleman TG185&#x27;s of Teo Fabi and Piercarlo Ghinzani) failed to finish the last F1 race for their teams.

<text>The Australian Maritime Officers Union (AMOU) is an Australian trade union that is registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (and additionally registered in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia) and affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Its membership covers mariners as well as professional, administrative, supervisory and technical employees in the maritime industry and dependent services. The AMOU uses the services model of trade unionism.

The AMOU National Office is located in Sydney, NSW. The National executive are:
* President: Captain Tim Higgs
* National Vice President: Ken Blackband
* National Delegates: Aaron Wild and Brent Middleton
* Offshore Divisional Delegates: James Gregson
* Port Services Divisional Delegates: Daryl Dorron
* Area Secretaries: 
*Seagoing delegate Matt Jepson
*Towage Delegate Ken Blackband
*Marine Pilot delegate Andrew Hawkins

The AMOU is composed of two Divisions: &quot;Offshore&quot; and &quot;Port Services&quot;.

The Eastern Area President: Vacant
Secretary: Brent Warhurst.
The Southern Area President: Vacant
The Western Area President: Paul Dolan 
Area Secretary: Glenn Anderson

The Australian Maritime Officers Union has previously published a journal called the &quot;Maritime Officer&quot;.

==History==
The AMOU traces its roots to the formation of the Mercantile Marine Officers&#x27; Association in the 1880s. The MMOA was one of the key unions involved in the 1890 Australian maritime dispute that began on 15 August 1890 and ended when members returned to work on the employers&#x27; terms in November 1890.

A general meeting of the MMOA on 12 February 1904 changed the name of the union to Merchant Service Guild of Australasia. The Guild registered under the &quot;Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act&quot; on 5 May 1905, the first registered federal employee organisation to do so. On 3 September 1957 the union changed its name to the Merchant Service Guild of Australia.

In 1976 it took over coverage of sea-going shipwrights, previously represented by the Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Association of Australia.
The Australian Maritime Officers Union was formed in 1993 with the merger of the Merchant Services Guild and the Australian Stevedoring Supervisors Association.

<text>Constitutive heterochromatin domains are regions of DNA found throughout the chromosomes of eukaryotes. The majority of constitutive heterochromatin is found at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, but is also found at the telomeres and throughout the chromosomes. In humans there is significantly more constitutive heterochromatin found on chromosomes 1, 9, 16, 19 and Y. Constitutive heterochromatin is composed mainly of high copy number tandem repeats known as satellite repeats, minisatellite and microsatellite repeats, and transposon repeats. In humans these regions account for about 200Mb or 6.5% of the total human genome, but their repeat composition makes them difficult to sequence, so only small regions have been sequenced.

Visualization of constitutive heterochromatin is possible by using the C-banding technique. The regions that stain darker are regions of constitutive heterochromatin. The constitutive heterochromatin stains darker because of the highly condensed nature of the DNA.

Constitutive heterochromatin is not to be confused with facultative heterochromatin, which is less condensed, less stable, and much less polymorphic, and which does not stain when using the C-banding technique.

== Function ==

Constitutive heterochromatin is found more commonly in the periphery of the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the euchromatic DNA in the center of the nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for proper segregation of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences.

Constitutive heterochromatin was thought to be relatively devoid of genes, but researchers have found more than 450 genes in the heterochromatic DNA of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; These regions are highly condensed and epigenetically modified to prevent transcription. For the genes to be transcribed, they must have a mechanism to overcome the silencing that occurs in the rest of the heterochromatin. There are many proposed models for how the genes in these regions are expressed, including the insulation, denial, integration, exploitation, and TE restraining models.

When genes are placed near a region of constitutive heterochromatin, their transcription is usually silenced. This is known as position-effect variegation and can lead to a mosaic phenotype.

== Replication and epigenetics ==
Constitutive heterochromatin is replicated late in S phase of the cell cycle and does not participate in meiotic recombination. 

Histone modifications are one of the main ways that the cell condenses constitutive heterochromatin. The three most common modifications in constitutive heterochromatin are histone hypoacetylation, histone H3-Lys9 methylation (H3K9), and cytosine methylation. These modifications are also found in other types of DNA, but much less frequently. Cytosine methylation is the most common type, although it is not found in all eukaryotes. In humans there is increased methylation at the centromeres and telomeres, which are composed of constitutive heterochromatin. These modifications can persist through both mitosis and meiosis and are heritable.

SUV39H1 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K9, providing a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 is involved in the chromatin condensing process that makes DNA inaccessible for transcription.

== Diseases ==
Genetic disorders that result from mutations involving the constitutive heterochromatin tend to affect cell differentiation and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Disorders include Roberts syndrome and ICF syndrome.

Some cancers are associated with anomalies in constitutive heterochromatin and the proteins involved in its formation and maintenance. Breast cancer is linked to a decrease in the HP1 alpha protein, while non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma is linked to hypomethylation of the genome and especially of satellite regions.

<text>The 1986 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jacarepaguá in Rio de Janeiro on 23 March 1986. It was the opening race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship. It was the 15th Brazilian Grand Prix and the seventh to be held at Jacarepaguá. The race was held over 61 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by local driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Williams-Honda, after he started from second position. Compatriot Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Renault, but Piquet overtook him on lap 3 and went on to win from him by 34 seconds. Frenchman Jacques Laffite finished third in a Ligier-Renault.

==Summary==
The new season had seen many driver changes, the most significant was Piquet&#x27;s arrival at Williams after seven years at Brabham, while Keke Rosberg left Williams to join McLaren and Elio de Angelis joined Brabham after several seasons at Lotus. Senna used his influence at Lotus to ensure they hired a driver that would not interfere with his campaign which left Derek Warwick out of a seat, although that would prove to be temporary. Williams was missing their team principal, Frank Williams who had had a car accident in pre-season testing that left him a quadriplegic.

Senna led from pole position but was soon under threat from the Williams pair. Nigel Mansell spun off the track on the opening lap after contact with Senna, but Piquet was in the lead by lap three. As pitstops began it started to look as though Alain Prost (McLaren MP4/2C) might pull a surprise by only pitting once and snatching the win away from the Brazilians but that came to an end along with Prost&#x27;s TAG-Porsche engine just past half-distance.

There was no threat to the Brazilian pair after that with Piquet retaking the lead from Senna after the latter&#x27;s final tyre stop. Behind Laffite was his Ligier teammate René Arnoux. Fifth place was taken by the Tyrrell 014-Renault of Martin Brundle for his first official points finish since his debut season two years previously (Brundle had scored several points in including 2 points on debut in Brazil and a 2nd placing at Detroit, but had lost all points when Tyrrell were disqualified for the season). Gerhard Berger finished sixth in his Benetton B186-BMW on the debut for the new team which had taken over the Toleman team during the off-season. Philippe Streiff in the second Tyrrell, Elio de Angelis (Brabham BT55), Johnny Dumfries (Lotus 98T) and Teo Fabi (Benetton B186) were the only other finishers in a day of high attrition where Mansell had been the only non-mechanical retirement.

<text>The 1986 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jerez on 13 April 1986. This was the first Formula One Spanish Grand Prix since the 1981 race was held at Jarama.

This race featured a 3 car battle for the lead over the last half of the race. Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault), Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) and reigning World Champion Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) all had opportunities to take the win, with close nose to tail racing around the circuit. Once Mansell pitted for fresh tyres he charged back into the fight making up over 19 seconds in the final 10 laps on his fresh rubber. It was not quite sufficient to take the win, but it was very close with Senna and Mansell taking the chequered flag almost side by side, Senna only 0.014 s in front of Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history. This was the third-closest finish in Formula One history, after Mansell&#x27;s spectacular charge allowed him to pull alongside Senna on the final straight.

In an interview after the race, Mansell said he had no problems with Senna&#x27;s defensive driving (blocking) at the end of the race when the Williams was clearly the quicker car, saying that Senna was entitled to protect his lead. He then jokingly added that the finish was so close they should give them both 7 points each (which is the average between the winner&#x27;s 9 points and second place&#x27;s 6).

<text>The 1986 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 27 April 1986. The race was the third round of the year&#x27;s World Championship. As with the previous year&#x27;s event, fuel consumption was a big issue, changing the points finishers in the closing laps.

The Autodromo Dino Ferrari had received safety upgrades from the previous year, including slight track modifications after the Variante Alta chicane and extended runoff areas at the Rivazza complex.
Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) dominated the race after Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault) and Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) retired early, before almost running out of fuel, three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (his McLaren teammate Keke Rosberg was classified 5th despite running dry 2 laps from the finish, a problem attributed to Rosberg using too much boost). Nelson Piquet brought his Williams home in second place only 7.645 seconds behind Prost, while Austrian Gerhard Berger finished third to score his and the Benetton team&#x27;s first Formula One podium finish.

This race saw the long awaited debut of Ford&#x27;s replacement for the old Cosworth DFV in the form of a new , turbocharged V6 engine designed by Keith Duckworth who had also designed the DFV. In its debut race in the also new Lola THL2 and driven by World Champion Alan Jones, the new Cosworth built Ford qualified in 21st place and completed 28 laps in the race before Jones was forced to retire with overheating.

<doc id="1122955" wikidata="Q2477664" url="?curid=1122955" title="Taconic Mountains">
<text>The Taconic Mountains () are a 150-mile-long sub-range of the Appalachian Mountains lying on the eastern border of New York State and adjacent New England. The range, which played a role in the history of geological science, is separated from the Berkshires and Green Mountains to the east by a series of valleys, principally those of the Housatonic River, Battenkill River and Otter Creek. The Taconics&#x27; highest point is Mount Equinox in Vermont at ; among many other summits are Dorset Mountain, Mount Greylock and Mount Everett.

Forests are predominately maple-beech-birch with some
spruce-fir at higher elevations, &quot;and oak and hickory common to the south and at lower elevations.&quot; Parts of the Taconics are in the New England-Acadian forests ecoregion. Although mostly private property, the Taconics contain a half-dozen sizable state forests and parks, as well as many preserves of lesser acreage protected by land trusts. Several hundred miles of trails are within these mountains, including parts of the Appalachian Trail.

==Name==
Taconic is likely from a Delaware word meaning &quot;in the trees&quot;. The spelling &quot;Taghkanic&quot;, among several variant transliterations, is current for about a half-dozen locales, mostly within the immediate region. As written English, the term appears in a 1685 petition for the right to purchase land in western Massachusetts. Timothy Dwight IV used the name &quot;Taughkannuc Mountain&quot; in an account of his 1781 ascent of the summit later named Mount Everett. Dwight&#x27;s account was deemed the &quot;first recorded ascent&quot; of that peak in a 1989 text on regional hiking history.

The term first entered geological literature in 1819 with Chester Dewey&#x27;s &quot;Sketch of the Mineralogy and Geology of the Vicinity of Williams&#x27; College&quot;. It gained prominence in the field when Dewey&#x27;s protégé Emmons proposed the existence of a &quot;Taconic System&quot; in 1839 (see above). In the 20th century, it became attached to the theory of an Ordovician mountain-building event involving much of what is now eastern North America named the &quot;Taconic Orogeny&quot;. 

==Geology==
The range is part of the Taconic Allochthon, a local rock structure which traveled to its current position from about 25 miles to the east through low-angle thrusting. Rocks of this allochthon are older than the strata lying beneath, and consist of slate, phyllite, and schist, &quot;plus some minor lenses of limestone.&quot; The Taconic allochthon is larger than the current Taconic Mountains, extending westward toward the Hudson River. It formed during the Ordovician period in the collision of the North American Plate into a volcanic island arc.

Geologist E-An Zen proved this allochthon&#x27;s existence in 1966 via a study of the region&#x27;s faulting, although it had been proposed around 1906 by Rudolf Ruedemann and separately by Arthur Keith, each using concepts associated with French geologist Marcel Alexandre Bertrand. Their proposals regarding the Taconics, however, were viewed as unproven and controversial until Zen&#x27;s work.

An earlier and largely separate dispute over the age of the Taconic Mountains based on the region&#x27;s sparse fossil record began in the 1830s and centered on the theory of Ebenezer Emmons of Williams College that the range was older than its surroundings with a distinct geology he named &quot;the Taconic System.&quot; In opposing Emmons&#x27; theory, James Hall of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute initially gained prominent support from famed international scientists of the day, including Louis Agassiz and Charles Lyell. 

Emmons died in 1863, yet as late as the 1880s two leading geologists of the era James Dwight Dana (Yale University) and Jules Marcou wrote of their continued and sometimes bitter disagreements over Emmons&#x27; theory. This early phase of ideas about the Taconic Mountains is compared with the Great Devonian Controversy that preoccupied British geologists for part of the 19th century.

==Description==
===South Taconics===
This area includes a locally significant and expansive area of undisturbed forest, although only a fraction is assured protection from development. Mount Washington State Forest and Taconic State Park are among the larger public properties within the immediate region. The highest summit here is Mount Everett , home of a pitch pine and scrub oak biome. Others include Mount Frissell, the south slope of which contains the highest point in Connecticut at ; Bear Mountain , the highest mountain peak in Connecticut; Alander Mountain , Brace Mountain ,; and Mount Fray , home of the Catamount Ski Area. The Appalachian Trail traverses the eastern escarpment of the range; the South Taconic Trail traverses the western escarpment, passing near Bash Bish Falls, reputedly Massachusetts&#x27; highest waterfall.

===Central Segment and Upper Hoosic River Valley Region===
From Catamount Ski Area north to the Hoosic River Valley, a straight-line distance of about 50 miles, the crest initially shifts slightly west. Notable summits in the southern part of this segment are Bald Mountain, , and Harvey Mountain, , as well as Beebe Hill, , with its summit fire tower.

Several miles to the northeast of Harvey Mountain is West Stockbridge Mountain and the Lenox Mountain massif; taken together, modern conservationists have named these two separate areas Yokun Ridge, an zone extending from the Massachusetts Turnpike to the southerly neighborhoods of Pittsfield at elevations ranging between roughly .

At Pittsfield, the crest shifts west once again to hills contained within Pittsfield State Forest and the contiguous Balance Rock Park and Bates Memorial State Park, where heights include Holy Mount , (once the location of religious rituals practiced by a former Shaker community) and Berry Hill , notable for its extensive stands of wild azalea.
North of Jiminy Peak , the valley of Kinderhook Creek cuts through the hills. Here the westernmost ridgeline is dominated by Misery Mountain and Berlin Mountain and extending into Pownal, Vermont. In this vicinity is Mount Greylock , the highest point in Massachusetts and the long ridge of Brodie Mountain.

Significant public property within the Taconics&#x27; central segment includes New York&#x27;s Beebe Hill and Harvey Mt. State Forest, Berlin State Forest, [[Pittsfield State Forest] and the contiguous Taconic Ridge State Forest and Taconic Trail State Park in New York and Massachusetts, respectively, as well as the [[Mount Greylock State Reservation]].

Within this segment are also three long-distance trails (the [[Appalachian Trail]], the [[Taconic Crest Trail]], and the [[Taconic Skyline Trail]])s.

===Southern Vermont===
North of the Massachusetts border, the profile of the Taconic Range is cut by the [[Hoosic River]] in the vicinity of [[Bennington, Vermont]]. Mount Anthony , notable for its caves and as the location of the former [[Southern Vermont College]], stands as a satellite peak above the surrounding eroded terrain. North of Bennington, the range gradually rises to its highest prominence with peaks such as [[Mount Equinox]] , the high point of the Taconic Mountains, and [[Dorset Mountain]] , a [[New England 100 Highest]] list summit. Other notable summits include [[Grass Mountain (Vermont)|Grass Mountain]] , a [[New England Fifty Finest]] list mountain; and [[Mount Aeolus (Vermont)|Mount Aeolus]] , the location of several defunct [[marble]] quarries and the site of [[Aeolus Cave]] an important [[bat]] [[hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]]. Designated hiking trails are located on Mount Equinox, Dorset Mountain, and Mount Aeolus, and several other peaks within the region.

===Northern terminus===
Immediately north of [[Danby, Vermont]], the Taconic Range broadens and becomes lower. It exhibits several parallel ridgelines, dominated to the west by mountains composed of [[slate]] and similar rock, most notably the ridgeline of Saint Catherine Mountain , with its conspicuous long cliff face visible from [[Wells, Vermont|Wells]] and [[Poultney, Vermont|Poultney]]. The area around [[Lake Saint Catherine (Vermont)|Lake Saint Catherine]] contains extensive slate quarries. The ridgeline to the east, composed of [[schist]] and [[phyllite]], is dominated by the escarpment of Tinmouth Mountain , overlooking the Valley of Vermont to the east in the town of [[Tinmouth, Vermont|Tinmouth]]. A field of less descript ridges and peaks lies between these two summits.

Near the end of the range, in the vicinity of [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]], the Taconic Mountains show several prominent peaks with dramatic, irregular cliff faces clearly visible from [[U.S. Route 4]] west of the city of Rutland; these include Herrick Mountain ; Grandpa&#x27;s Knob , the former site of the [[Smith–Putnam wind turbine]], the first large-scale electricity-producing [[wind turbine]]; and the [[butte]]-like Bird Mountain (also called Birdseye Mountain) , home of the Bird Mountain Wildlife Management Area and notable as an important [[bird of prey|raptor]] migration path and nesting site. Also part of the Taconic Mountains are the foothills of the [[Lake Bomoseen]] region west of Birdseye and Grandpa&#x27;s Knob, notable for their extensive slate quarrying operations. North of Grandpa&#x27;s Knob, the Taconic Range soon diminishes into scattered hills which extend north into the [[Burlington, Vermont]] region. Isolated summits in this area include [[Snake Mountain (Vermont)|Snake Mountain]] , a [[Nature Conservancy]] preserve featuring a variety of rare and endangered species; and Mount Philo , home of [[Mount Philo State Park]] with its mountaintop campground.

==History==
[[Natural resource]] extraction has been an important industry in the Taconic Mountains; extraction industries have included [[marble]], [[limestone]], [[slate]], and [[iron]] mining as well as [[logging]] and [[charcoal]]ing. 

==Conservation==
Along with various state properties, some mentioned elsewhere in this article, the [[Berkshire Natural Resources Council]] and the [[Nature Conservancy]] have been active in the region. The [[U.S. Forest Service]] has designated several areas within the Taconics under its [[Forest Legacy Program]], which affords subsidies for the acquisition of conservation easement, although practical effects have been limited. Minor fragments of the [[Green Mountain National Forest]] are located in the Northern Taconics. Multi-partner collaboratives that have targeted the Taconic Mountains with limited results and include the New England Wildlands and Woodlands Collaborative, a regional conservation agenda for the [[New England]] states produced by representatives of dozens of non-profits and academic institutions and, more specifically, the Taconic Crest Project, which involves the states of New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont in collaboration with local land trusts and The Nature Conservancy.

<text>The 1986 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 11 May 1986. It was the fourth race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship. The Monaco circuit had been modified from the year before: the chicane after the tunnel now had three turns and was renamed the Nouvelle Chicane. The end result was that the chicane was slowed considerably from the old left-right flick it was previously, plus it added 16 metres to the circuit length.

Patrick Tambay had a spectacular accident when he and Martin Brundle tangled at Mirabeau, and Tambay&#x27;s Lola-Ford went right over Brundle&#x27;s Tyrrell-Renault, caught six feet of air and barrel-rolled into the protective Armco right next to some spectators, and in the process almost went over the Armco into a bar next to the track. Luckily the Lola landed upright and Tambay was able to walk away from the accident unscathed.

The 78-lap race was won from pole position by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG. This was Prost&#x27;s third consecutive Monaco win. His Finnish teammate Keke Rosberg finished second, with Brazilian Ayrton Senna third in a Lotus-Renault.

This was also the last Grand Prix for Italian Elio de Angelis, before his fatal testing accident at Paul Ricard three days later.

This was the last Monaco Grand Prix where only 20 cars would be allowed to start. From the 1987 race the available grid size would be the same 26 cars as every other race.

<text>The 1986 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps on 25 May 1986. It was the fifth race of the 1986 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was the 44th Belgian Grand Prix and the 32nd to be held at Spa-Francorchamps. It was held over 43 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of .

The race was won by British driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. It was Mansell&#x27;s first victory of the season. Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna finished second in a Lotus-Renault, with Sweden&#x27;s Stefan Johansson third in a Ferrari. Senna&#x27;s result allowed him to take the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship from Frenchman Alain Prost, who could only manage sixth in his McLaren-TAG.

==Qualifying==
Brabham entered only one BT55, the car of Riccardo Patrese. Elio de Angelis had been killed in a testing accident at Circuit Paul Ricard just over a week before the race. Williams-Honda driver Nelson Piquet took pole late in the qualifying session using the team&#x27;s spare car. Piquet&#x27;s engine blew up in his race car during qualifying forcing him into the spare. Austrian Gerhard Berger scored his first front row start and the first for the BMW powered Benetton after being fastest in Friday qualifying. His Friday time of 1:54.468 was half a second faster than his Saturday time but still good enough for the front row. World Champion Alain Prost was third in his McLaren-TAG with the Lotus-Renault of Ayrton Senna completing the second row. Nigel Mansell qualified fifth in his Williams-Honda with Teo Fabi completing the top 6 in his Benetton-BMW.

==Race==
Piquet won the start and led the field into the La Source hairpin but behind him was chaos. Senna had made a good start from the 2nd row and when Berger&#x27;s car twitched under brakes Senna went to the outside and then turned hard into the right hand corner. In doing so he squeezed out Berger who in turn squeezed out Prost while avoiding Senna. Prost, who had gone inside when the Benetton twitched, hit the inside barrier damaging the nose of his car with the right front wing drooping on the ground. He then drove over Berger&#x27;s wheel launching the rear of his McLaren into the air. Other drivers were forced to take avoiding action with Berger&#x27;s teammate Fabi having to stop to avoid hitting his teammates damaged car while Prost&#x27;s teammate Keke Rosberg had to do a complete 180 degree turn the wrong way to avoid the Benettons. However, the only car that retired from the crash was the Lola-Ford of Patrick Tambay who went inside the stopped Fabi but hit his right rear with his left front wheel and damaged the left front suspension putting him out on the spot. Through it all Senna emerged unscathed in 2nd place followed by Mansell and the two Ferraris of Stefan Johansson and Michele Alboreto.

Both Berger and Prost pitted at the end of lap 1 with Berger in for a long stop for repairs and Prost for a new nose cone, his rear suspension survived intact despite its unscheduled first corner flight. Mansell disposed of Senna on lap 2, but spun on lap 5, falling back to 4th place. Piquet led until suffering turbo failure on lap 16 leaving Senna in front from Mansell, who shortly overtook Senna during pitstops. Prost emerged last on the road and only a few hundred metres in front of the leading Williams. On his way to being the last car on the lead lap and finishing in sixth place he set a new lap record of 1:59.282 on lap 31.

Nigel Mansell scored his first win of 1986 and the third win of his career. Senna, the cause of the first corner crash finished 20 seconds behind in second with Stefan Johansson finishing third after passing team leader Alboreto only two laps from home. Jacques Laffite finished fifth in his Ligier-Renault with Prost gaining a vital World Championship point for finishing sixth. Swiss driver Marc Surer finished ninth in his Arrows A8 in what would be the last Grand Prix of Surer&#x27;s career – he would be seriously injured competing in the European Rally Championship a week later. Post race Mansell dedicated his win to his friend and former team mate Elio de Angelis who died just ten days prior to Spa in a testing accident at Paul Ricard.

<text>The 1986 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal on 15 June 1986. It was the sixth race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship.

The 69-lap race was won from pole position by Briton Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. Frenchman Alain Prost finished second in a McLaren-TAG, with Mansell&#x27;s Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet third. Prost took the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by two points from Mansell and another Brazilian, Ayrton Senna, who finished fifth in his Lotus-Renault.

This would prove to be the final Canadian Grand Prix held on the circuit in its original configuration with the pits and start/finish straight coming out of the Epingle de Casino Hairpin. After a sponsorship dispute saw the race not held in , a new pit complex was built at the other end of the circuit just before the Epingle de L&#x27;ile Hairpin with the circuit also being reprofiled to accommodate a new start/finish straight that would open in time for the race. The changes to the circuit would result in one less corner (down from 19 to 18), but also added an extra 20 metres of track.

<text>The 1986 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Paul Ricard on 6 July 1986. It was the eighth race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship.

Following Elio de Angelis&#x27;s fatal testing crash on the full circuit two months previously, a decision was made to use the shorter, &quot;Club&quot; circuit for this race and for future F1 races (up to and including 1990). This eliminated the high-speed Verrerie bends, where de Angelis had crashed, and reduced the length of the Mistral straight from to . Nonetheless, the cars still recorded speeds of over on the straight.

The 80-lap race was won by Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. It was Mansell&#x27;s third victory of the season. Alain Prost finished second in a McLaren-TAG, with Nelson Piquet third in the other Williams-Honda. Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Renault, but crashed at Signes early in the race after sliding on oil laid by Andrea de Cesaris&#x27;s failed Minardi.

This race marked Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s 400th start in a World Championship event as a team.

<text>The 1986 British Grand Prix (formally the XXXIX Shell Oils British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch in Kent, England on 13 July 1986. It was the ninth race of the 1986 FIA Formula One World Championship.

French driver Jacques Laffite broke both legs during a multi-car pile-up at the start, resulting in the end of his Formula One career. Laffite, driving a Ligier-Renault, was assisted by Zakspeed driver Jonathan Palmer, a qualified general practitioner before taking up motor racing in the late 1970s. Laffite was making his 176th Formula One start, equalling Graham Hill&#x27;s record. The pile-up caused the race to be stopped; it was restarted over an hour later, after Laffite had been airlifted to Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital in nearby Sidcup.

The race was eventually won by local driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. Mansell won after a battle with Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet, finishing 5.5 seconds ahead. Reigning World Champion, Frenchman Alain Prost, finished third in his McLaren-TAG, one lap adrift.

The race also saw the return to the paddock of Frank Williams for the first time since he was paralysed in a road accident in France four months earlier.

This was the last British Grand Prix and also the last Formula One race to be held at Brands Hatch. The international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with circuits, and Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility to Silverstone, with much less room to expand. In May 1986, Silverstone and its owner, the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC), signed a long-term contract with FISA; the British Grand Prix has been held at the Northamptonshire circuit since 1987. The only time that major single-seater racing returned to Brands Hatch was the London Champ Car Trophy for CART in 2003.

The 45-lap race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Williams-Honda. Compatriot Ayrton Senna was second in a Lotus-Renault, with Briton Nigel Mansell third in the other Williams-Honda. Frenchman Alain Prost was running third in his McLaren-TAG in the closing laps when he ran out of fuel, dropping him to sixth and thus allowing Mansell to extend his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to seven points.

==Pre-race==
In the run-up to the race, Keke Rosberg announced that he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season, while Lotus announced that they would be using Honda engines in 1987, following Renault&#x27;s withdrawal from the sport, with Japanese driver Satoru Nakajima replacing Johnny Dumfries. Meanwhile, Ligier drafted in Philippe Alliot to replace the injured Jacques Laffite.

<text>The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA) is an Australian employee organisation (effectively a trade union) which represents aircraft maintenance engineers. The ALAEA is registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. ALAEA is not affiliated with an Australian political party, but maintains industrial affiliations with the NSW Labor Council and the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation. ALAEA was formed in 1964. It sees its own function as a professional association, which puts it within the services model of union organisation. ALAEA does not describe itself as a trade union, or organisation of workers.

The Australian Trade Union Archives claim that ALAEA&#x27;s current membership is in excess of 3000 members. The ALAEA claims to have in excess of 4000 members and in its most recent annual return claimed to have 4085 members as of 1 January 2005, although this date could have been a typographical error (and should have been 1 January 2006) as the previous year&#x27;s annual return also referred to the same date. ALAEA&#x27;s membership coverage is for Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (LAMES), Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AMES), technical and engineering support staff.

The main employer groups that the ALAEA has dealings with are Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar.

<text>The 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the newly constructed Hungaroring on 10 August 1986. It was the eleventh race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship.

It was the first Hungarian Grand Prix since 1936, and the first-ever Formula One race to be held behind the Iron Curtain. The race was attended by 200,000 spectators from across the Eastern Bloc; this stood as a record for a Formula One race for nearly a decade, until 210,000 attended the 1995 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide.

The race was notable for the battle between fierce Brazilian rivals Nelson Piquet in his Williams-Honda and Ayrton Senna in his Lotus-Renault. Piquet, after an unsuccessful attempt on the previous lap, managed to pass the Lotus driver around the outside as they went into the first corner, on opposite lock. He also came in for some criticism following the race, especially in the British press, as he had allegedly neglected to tell his team-mate Nigel Mansell about the benefits of a new differential which provided better grip on the slippery, dusty surface (however, it later came to light that Mansell had in fact tried the new diff in practice but had preferred the older one).

The race was won by Piquet, ahead of Senna. Mansell finished 3rd and a lap down in his Williams with Stefan Johansson (Ferrari), Johnny Dumfries (Lotus) and Martin Brundle (Tyrrell-Renault) rounding out the points finishers. Defending World Champion Alain Prost qualified 3rd in his McLaren-TAG, an accident on lap 23 saw him as a non-finisher in what was his 100th Grand Prix start.

<text>The 1986 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 17 August 1986. It was the twelfth race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship.

The 52-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, with Ferrari drivers Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson second and third respectively. With Drivers&#x27; Championship challengers Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna all retiring, Prost moved into second place in the Championship, two points behind Mansell.

===Qualifying report===
Qualifying saw several surprises as the Benetton-BMWs of Teo Fabi and Gerhard Berger filled the front row, Fabi just under 0.2 seconds ahead, while Riccardo Patrese took fourth in his Brabham despite a crash, just behind Keke Rosberg&#x27;s McLaren. The four Drivers&#x27; Championship challengers occupied fifth to eighth in the order of Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren, the two Williams of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet, and Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus. Completing the top ten were Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and Derek Warwick in the second Brabham.

Pat Symonds would later claim that following Benetton&#x27;s front-row lockout, the head of BMW Motorsport, Paul Rosche, demanded to inspect the engine control unit chips installed in the team&#x27;s engines to see if they had been tampered with in breach of contract (Benetton were using customer engines that were the original upright configuration rather than the special, tilted BMWs Brabham were using, but Benetton&#x27;s engines were still supplied and maintained by BMW). However, the team had wisely kept their supply of original BMW Motorsport chips for just such an occurrence and were able to provide Rosche with those rather than the modified ones they had actually been using. The modified chips were said to give the Benetton-BMWs an alleged , some over the official factory units used by Brabham. In fact, 1986 was the high watermark for power figures in Formula One with the BMW, Honda, Renault, Ferrari and TAG-Porsche turbo&#x27;s all allegedly pumping out over in qualifying trim.

Derek Warwick in his lowline Brabham BT55 was the quickest car through the speed trap heading into the high speed Bosch Kurve being recorded during qualifying at . The low line Brabhams with their factory BMW turbos were proving to be far more effective on the high speed Österreichring where the Hella-Licht chicane was the only really slow section of the track. Showing the difference in car set up (and it must be said, drivers&#x27;), Patrese, running more wing than his team mate was some 1.682 seconds faster around the circuit even though his recorded top speed was slower.

===Race report===
Warwick was a non-starter in bizarre circumstances. After the Englishman&#x27;s car was repaired following a gearbox failure in the morning warm-up, the two Brabhams went to the grid, Patrese in the spare car following his qualifying crash. Then, as Patrese took his place on the grid, his own gearbox broke. As the Italian driver was six places ahead of Warwick, the decision was made on the grid to hand him Warwick&#x27;s car for the rest of the race. Warwick later admitted that team owner Bernie Ecclestone had to physically drag him from the car as he refused to hand it over.

When the race got underway, local driver Berger took the lead from Fabi, while Rosberg and Patrese made slow starts and were overtaken by Prost, Mansell and Piquet. Patrese retired after two laps with an engine failure, while the same fate befell Senna after 13 laps. On lap 17, Fabi overtook Berger at the Bosch-Kurve, only for his own engine to fail seconds later. Mansell moved into second place when Prost made a pit stop for tyres, then the lead shortly afterwards when Berger pitted with a battery problem. Prost took the lead when Mansell made his own pit stop, before both Williams retired within three laps of each other, Piquet with an overheating engine and Mansell with a broken driveshaft. This left Prost around half a minute clear of team-mate Rosberg, with Alboreto up to third. Five laps from the end, Rosberg suffered an electrical failure, leaving Prost to win by a full lap from Alboreto with a further lap back to the second Ferrari of Stefan Johansson in third; the top six was completed by the two Haas Lolas of Alan Jones and Patrick Tambay and the Arrows of Christian Danner. Berger, having lost four laps as a result of his battery problem, made a charge to finish close behind Danner, setting the fastest lap of the race in the process.

Alan Jones was actually aided by a slipping clutch in his Lola-Ford as it meant much less wheelspin, thus he was able to complete the race (albeit 2 laps down on Prost) without having to stop to change his Goodyears. His 4th place and Tambay&#x27;s 5th were cause for celebration in the Haas Lola camp as it was their first ever World Championship points and the first for the Ford turbo engine.

With the win, Prost moved from fourth to second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and cut Mansell&#x27;s lead to two points, 55 to 53, with Senna on 48 and Piquet on 47.

In the post race press conference, Alboreto was asked if the podiums were the start of a Ferrari revival, though he was reluctant to agree, instead pointing out that it was more through on the day reliability over most of their faster rivals than any great leap forward in speed by the F1/86.

<text>The 1986 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 7 September 1986. It was the thirteenth race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship.

The 51-lap race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Williams-Honda. Piquet&#x27;s British teammate and Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Nigel Mansell, finished second, with Swede Stefan Johansson third in a Ferrari. The other two championship challengers, Frenchman Alain Prost and Brazilian Ayrton Senna, both failed to finish, Senna suffering a transmission failure in his Lotus-Renault at the very start of the race and Prost being disqualified halfway through for illegally switching to his spare McLaren-TAG after the start of the formation lap.

The win moved Piquet into second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, five points behind Mansell and three ahead of Prost, with three races remaining.

==Qualifying report==
During the second qualifying session at Monza, the Benetton-BMW of Gerhard Berger was recorded as being the fastest car along the start-finish straight, with a top speed of . He was followed by four more BMW-powered cars: teammate Teo Fabi, the Brabhams of Derek Warwick and Riccardo Patrese, and the Arrows of Thierry Boutsen. The fastest non-BMW powered car was the Williams-Honda of Nigel Mansell, with a top speed slower than that of Berger.

Despite this, Berger could only qualify fourth, while Fabi took his second consecutive pole position. Alain Prost lined up alongside Fabi on the front row, despite being nearly half a second slower in his McLaren-TAG and recording a top speed over slower than Berger&#x27;s. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Mansell was third, ahead of Berger, while Brazilian pair Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault) and Nelson Piquet (Williams-Honda) made up the third row. The top 10 was completed by Warwick, Keke Rosberg in the second McLaren, Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari and Patrese; Alboreto&#x27;s position was notable as he had missed the first day of qualifying after injuring his arm in a motorcycle crash.

The race saw the debut of local driver Alex Caffi, deputising for Allen Berg at Osella, as well as the debut of the French AGS team, whose Motori Moderni-powered JH21C was driven by another local driver, Ivan Capelli. With the number of entries increased to 27 at both this race and the next race in Portugal, FISA decided to allow all the cars to start. Caffi was the beneficiary of this decision, starting 27th behind Capelli and Osella teammate Piercarlo Ghinzani.

==Race report==
Following problems at the start of the formation lap, pole position man Teo Fabi was forced to start from the back of the grid and Alain Prost, alongside him on the front row, had to start from the pit lane in the spare car. At the green light, Gerhard Berger took the lead, but on lap eight lost positions to first Mansell, Piquet, and an on-form Alboreto in the Ferrari. Ayrton Senna was out with a broken gearbox at the start. Alboreto looked to be in challenging the Williams duo for the lead having overtaken Rosberg, Arnoux and Berger before spinning at the exit of the first chicane. Like the British Grand Prix, the race became a close fight between the two Williams drivers, but this time Piquet hunted down his teammate British driver Nigel Mansell to take the victory. Piquet defeated Mansell in a straight fight, leading the Briton home by 9.828 seconds. The Brazilian managed to pass Mansell at the Curva Grande to go on and claim his fourth win of the season. Behind, Fabi and Prost had charged from the rear and by lap 12 were running 8th and 9th. Prost was disqualified for changing cars after the start of the formation lap, which was illegal, but his engine blew up a lap after he was flagged anyway. Johansson charged early in the race, passing Rosberg and Arnoux on lap five to go on to finish third. Berger survived to finish 5th one lap down, while Alan Jones scored the final point in the Haas team&#x27;s anniversary race having made their F1 debut in Italy in .

<text>The 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 21 September 1986. It was the fourteenth race of the 1986 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 70-lap race was won by British driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. Brazilian Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Renault, but Mansell passed him at the start and led the entire race, also setting the fastest race lap. Senna held on to second place until he ran out of fuel on the final lap and dropped to fourth, promoting Frenchman Alain Prost in the McLaren-TAG to second and Mansell&#x27;s Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet to third.

The win, Mansell&#x27;s fifth of the season, gave him a ten-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races remaining, with Piquet second and Prost a further point back in third. Senna&#x27;s final-lap misfortune ended his challenge for the title. The win also secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Williams, their third in all.

<text>The 1986 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mexico City on October 12, 1986.

The first Mexican Grand Prix since 1970 was held at the newly renamed Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, located in the Magdalena Mixhuca recreational sports park in the middle of Mexico City. The track had been slightly shortened and modified from its previous layout; although Mexico City was located on a geologically active surface; so the circuit was very bumpy- and the most fearsome and spectacular corner on the circuit, the banked 275 km/h, 180-degree Peraltada turn remained from before, but with more run-off area and less banking than before.

It was the first win for Gerhard Berger and the first win for the Benetton team. Benetton ran on Pirelli tyres, and their relative durability compared to competitors on Goodyear tyres played to the team&#x27;s advantage. Berger won this race due to not having to make a pit stop for a fresh set of tyres. It would also prove to be the final win for the turbocharged BMW engine.

Starting from third on the grid, Nigel Mansell could have wrapped up his first World Drivers&#x27; Championship with a win. However, it all went wrong on the grid when he went to select first gear for the start, and was still fumbling trying to get it in when the lights went green. By the time he got his Williams-Honda into gear more than two thirds of the field had gone past and he finished the first lap in 18th place. He would ultimately finish in 5th place meaning that the following Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide would see a three-way shootout for the championship between Mansell, defending champion Prost looking to be the first driver to win back-to-back championships since Jack Brabham in –, and Mansell&#x27;s own Williams team mate Nelson Piquet looking to win his 3rd championship after winning the and titles.

<text>A caucus chair is a person who chairs the meetings of a caucus. Often, the caucus chair is assigned other duties as well.

==Canada==
In Canada, the elected members of each party in Parliament, including senators, or a provincial legislature, elect among themselves a caucus chair who presides over their meetings. This person is an important figure when the party is in opposition and an important link between cabinet and the backbench when the party is in government.

==United States==
In common U.S. Congressional Republican caucus legislative usage, the caucus chairman is styled conference chairman and is outranked by the Speaker or Senate President pro-tempore, and the leader or whip of his party.

The duties of a caucus chairman depend upon the political party caucus. In the Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives, for instance, the caucus chairman is in charge of coordinating the party&#x27;s overall message.

The position of caucus chairman may or may not lead to higher office. Republican conference chair John Anderson and Democratic Caucus Chair Richard Gephardt unsuccessfully sought their party&#x27;s Presidential nominations in 1980 and 1988 respectively. Anderson took his following and ran as a third party presidential candidate the same year, and never again achieved national prominence as a Republican. Gephardt though was elected as the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives in 1989, and stayed in that position through 2002, before stepping down to run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President again in 2004. Gephardt helped nominate John Kerry by promptly endorsing him after Kerry defeated him in the Iowa caucuses.

Many state legislative bodies have caucus chairmen for both party caucuses in the House and in the Senate. The duties of the caucus chairman, as with the federal government, depend on the decisions of the caucus. The number of times each caucus meets, the role of each caucus in aiding legislative decision-making, the interrelationships with other caucus leaders and memberships, the assignment of political and institutional duties, all vary in accordance with local traditions and personalities.

Caucuses do not always function well. In Congress in the 1950s, for instance, the House Democratic Caucus met so infrequently that insurgent Democrats formed the House Democratic Study Group, led by Rep. Eugene J. McCarthy, later a U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, to do the work of reviewing legislation now generally done by caucuses under the direction of the caucus chairmen.

Caucuses have zealously guarded their prerogatives from the executive branch. When outgoing Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson became Vice-President, the President of the Senate, he suggested that his duties should include presiding over the Senate Democratic Caucus. Senate Democratic Caucus members generated enough opposition, to what they perceived as executive branch intrusion, that Johnson dropped his idea.

<doc id="1122976" wikidata="Q15039" url="?curid=1122976" title="1986 Australian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1986 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 26 October 1986 at the Adelaide Street Circuit, Adelaide, Australia. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1986 Formula One World Championship. The race decided a three-way battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship between Brit Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda; his Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet; and Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG.

Mansell took pole position for the race, but a poor start off the grid enabled teammate Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Keke Rosberg to overtake him and demote him to fourth by the end of the first lap.

A few laps into the race, Finland&#x27;s Keke Rosberg, in his final Grand Prix, took the lead from Piquet. However, the Finn retired with a puncture on lap 63, handing the lead back to Piquet and elevating Mansell into third place, which would have been sufficient to secure the championship. One lap later, Mansell&#x27;s race ended as his left-rear tyre exploded on the main straight with 19 laps remaining. The title was then between Piquet and Prost with the latter needing to finish ahead of the former to successfully defend his title. Following the tyre failures of Rosberg and Mansell, the Williams team called Piquet in for a precautionary tyre change leaving him 15 seconds behind. He made a late charge to close the gap to 4.2 seconds but Prost took victory to win his second of four titles.

It was not until the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix that there were again three possible drivers&#x27; title contenders entering the final race of the season.

This was the final Grand Prix for 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and for 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg.

==Background==
Going into the race, three drivers were in contention for the World Championship. Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda, led with 70 points, while reigning champion Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, was second on 64 and Mansell&#x27;s teammate Nelson Piquet was third on 63.

The Williams-Honda was superior in speed to the McLaren-TAG, with Mansell and Piquet having won nine of the previous fifteen races between them, and the team sealing the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the Portuguese Grand Prix in late September. However, Mansell and Piquet had been battling with one another and had taken points from each other on a number of occasions, while Prost&#x27;s consistency had seen him accumulate points all year and thus remain in touch with the Williams drivers.

Nonetheless, Mansell went into the race in the strongest position among the three drivers, needing only to finish third or higher to take the title, while Prost and Piquet both needed to win to have any chance.

==Qualifying report==
Qualifying saw Mansell take pole position from teammate Piquet by 0.3 seconds, with Ayrton Senna third in his Lotus, a further 0.2 seconds back. Prost was fourth but 1.2 seconds behind Mansell, followed by René Arnoux in the Ligier and Gerhard Berger in the Benetton. Completing the top ten were Keke Rosberg in the second McLaren, Philippe Alliot in the second Ligier, Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari and Philippe Streiff in the Tyrrell. Andrea de Cesaris surprised by taking eleventh, the best grid position for the Minardi team up to this point, ahead of Stefan Johansson in the second Ferrari, Teo Fabi in the second Benetton and Johnny Dumfries in the second Lotus.

Friday&#x27;s qualifying was interrupted about halfway through by a sudden and heavy downpour which caught out both Patrick Tambay (Haas Lola) and Johansson who (in separate accidents) slid off the road behind the pits and across the wet, muddy grass of the Victoria Park Racecourse infield before hitting an unprotected concrete wall side on with both the Lola-Ford and the Ferrari wrecked upon impact. The wall, not previously seen as a problem as it was well off the track, had 2 rows of tyres protecting it by Saturday morning. Both drivers were OK other than general soreness and bruising.

Both McLaren drivers had a mystifying 2nd qualifying session. During the morning practice, Prost had been the fastest with a 1:19.121, 4 seconds inside the lap record, faster than Mansell&#x27;s Friday qualifying time, 7/10ths faster than his own Friday time and faster even than Senna&#x27;s 1985 pole time. However, while others around them improved on their Friday times, neither the reigning World Champion nor his soon to be retired team mate Rosberg (who was 2nd in the morning session) could get near the morning times in the afternoon, reporting a distinct lack of grip even before Streiff&#x27;s Renault blew-up and all but ruined the last 20 minutes of qualifying after he coated the racing line down the Brabham Straight and around the right hand hairpin with a good amount of Elf&#x27;s finest before parking his Tyrrell off to the inside of the hairpin exit.

Home country hero Alan Jones in his last drive in Formula One was, for a rare time, ahead of his team mate Tambay on the grid. Using a revised Ford engine, the Lola&#x27;s qualified 15th and 17th, though both were over 4.3 seconds slower than Mansell&#x27;s pole time.

The Australian Grand Prix also saw Tambay&#x27;s Lola and the Lotus of Johnny Dumfries each carrying an onboard camera for television use. During qualifying, Martin Brundle&#x27;s Tyrrell-Renault was timed at a fastest of all on the 900 metre long Brabham Straight. Due to the FISA mandated turbo boost restrictions in (4.0 Bar) and (2.5 Bar), plus the cars having Naturally aspirated engines from , Brundle&#x27;s speed would be the fastest ever recorded on the Adelaide Street Circuit.

==Race report==
The prospect of a three-way battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship crown attracted a capacity crowd of 150,000 to the Adelaide circuit.

Mansell yielded the lead to Senna&#x27;s Lotus at the second corner on lap 1 and fell behind both Piquet and Rosberg on the same lap. Piquet also overtook Senna on lap 1 to take the lead but it would last only six laps as on lap 7, Rosberg took the lead from Piquet and began to build a sizeable gap between himself and the rest of the field.

On lap 23 Piquet spun, although no damage was sustained to the car, and he continued the race despite dropping back several places. Prost suffered a puncture a few laps later and he dropped to fourth position after having to pit. Piquet charged back through the field, passing Mansell for second place on lap 44, but Prost closed on the two Williams cars and, with 25 laps to go, all three championship contenders were running together in positions 2, 3 and 4.

The battle became one for the lead on lap 63 when Rosberg suffered a right rear tyre failure and retired from the race. Rosberg later revealed that he would never have won the race anyway unless Prost failed to finish or had sufficient problem not to be able to challenge, as he had promised Prost and the team that he would give best to his teammate to help his bid to win back-to-back championships. Prost had just passed Mansell for third which became second when Rosberg retired, with Piquet now leading. Mansell only needed a third-place finish to win the championship.

Mansell was still in third position when, on lap 64, his left rear tyre exploded at on the high-speed Brabham Straight as he was lapping Alliot&#x27;s Ligier, sending a shower of sparks flying behind him and severely damaging his left rear suspension. The Williams coasted to a stop in the run-off area at the end of the straight, Mansell managing to avoid hitting anything. Fearing the same happening to the second car, Williams called Piquet to the pits and Prost took the lead. Piquet would make a late charge, closing the gap from 15.484 seconds with 2 laps remaining to just 4.205 at the finish and Prost claimed both the race and the World Championship. Prost had so little fuel left that he pulled up only metres past the finish line.

In his last race for Ferrari, Johansson completed the podium in third place, albeit a lap down on Prost and Piquet. Martin Brundle ran out of fuel as he crossed the line in fourth place in his Tyrrell. His teammate Streiff finished fifth, two laps down, with Dumfries taking the final point in his Lotus.

By winning, Prost became the first and so far only driver to ever win the Australian Grand Prix in both non-championship and World Championship form, having won the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix run for Formula Pacific cars at the Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne.

This was the last race for the Renault turbo engine, the French company being the pioneers in Formula One turbocharging back in , as well as Renault&#x27;s last F1 race as an engine supplier until their return with Williams in . It was also the last F1 race for two former World Champions, champion Alan Jones and champion Rosberg, as well as the last race for Patrick Tambay, Dumfries, Allen Berg and Huub Rothengatter, and for Team Haas, whom both Jones and Tambay drove for.

<doc id="1122977" wikidata="Q54409" url="?curid=1122977" title="1987 Brazilian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 12 April 1987 at the Jacarepaguá Circuit in Rio de Janeiro. The race, contested over 61 laps, was the sixteenth Brazilian Grand Prix and the eighth to be held at Jacarepaguá, and the first race of the 1987 Formula One season.

The race was won by defending World Champion Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG. Local hero Nelson Piquet was second in a Williams-Honda, while Prost&#x27;s new teammate Stefan Johansson took third.

==Qualifying==
March Engineering returned to Formula One for the first time since the 1982 Caesars Palace Grand Prix, entering a single car driven by Ivan Capelli.

In almost a repeat of , prior to the race there was talk of a drivers boycott due to the FIA&#x27;s new Super Licence fees for 1987. Previously the fee for a drivers Super Licence had been US$825. However, from 1987 drivers who scored World Championship points the previous season would be required to pay more (i.e. the more points a driver scored, the more he paid for his licence) with drivers such as World Champion Alain Prost and Williams pair Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet were all required to pay around $12,000 (while others such as Lotus rookie Satoru Nakajima only had to pay the basic fee). According to the drivers, it wasn&#x27;t so about the money, it was the principle that a licence is a licence and that the fee should be the same for everyone. However, by the time the cars were ready for Friday morning&#x27;s first practice session, everyone (or in some cases the teams) had paid the required licence fee.

Qualifying was dominated by the Honda powered Williams, with Mansell ahead of Piquet. Third was Ayrton Senna with his Lotus. The Lotus 99T, now in the Yellow and Blue colours of new sponsors Camel Cigarettes, was using the computer-controlled active suspension for the first time in the hope that its advantages (keeping the car at the optimum ride height) would give them an edge over the rest of the field. The total number of cars entered for the event was 23, but on race day the March team, who went into the race with a modified Formula 3000 car for F1 rookie Ivan Capelli due to their new car not being ready, ran out of Cosworth DFZs, blowing their last in the Sunday morning warm-up and there were only 22 starters.

Qualifying also saw the FIA&#x27;s controversial pop-off valves used for the first time on the turbocharged cars. The valves limited turbo boost pressure to 4.0 Bar where previously boost was only limited to what the engineers felt the engines could take. The valves were far from popular with the teams and drivers, however, with some drivers complaining throughout the weekend that they were cutting in too early and not allowing enough boost. Arrows driver Derek Warwick told that at times his valve was opening at just 2.6 Bar (a loss of approximately ) while Benetton&#x27;s Thierry Boutsen told that the two valves on his Ford V6 were both opening at different levels and both well below the 4 Bar limit. McLaren got around the pop-off valve problem by limiting turbo boost on their TAG-Porsche engines to just 3.6 Bar of pressure throughout the weekend, thus never allowing the valves to come into play. One unnamed team mechanic was reported to have said that the valves were the only crude piece of engineering on a modern Grand Prix car.

The Ligier team was absent from Rio, missing their first race since the French boycott of the 1985 South African Grand Prix. The team had been set to use a new 4-cylinder, turbocharged Alfa Romeo engine for the season. However, during pre-season testing lead driver René Arnoux compared the new 415T to used food. This gave Alfa&#x27;s parent company Fiat the excuse they wanted to pull out of its association with the team leaving Ligier without an engine for the season, though Ligier were able to secure a supply of Megatron turbo&#x27;s from the Arrows team sponsors USF&amp;G and would use them from San Marino until the end of the season.

==Race==
At the start Piquet was fastest, taking the lead from Senna, while Mansell made a bad start; the Benetton B187s of Boutsen and Teo Fabi out dragged Mansell and Prost. Adrián Campos was disqualified for an incorrect starting procedure, he had forgotten his ear plugs and by the time he had fitted them on the grid the rest of the field had moved away on the warm-up lap. Campos resumed his grid position instead of starting at the rear, and race officials removed him for his rookie mistake. Piquet&#x27;s lead did not last long: on lap 7, he had to pit with engine overheating caused by litter on the track getting into the radiator sidepods. He rejoined back in eleventh position, leaving Senna to lead Mansell (who in the meantime fought back to second) although he too entered in the pits to have his radiators cleared. He rejoined behind Piquet and the pair began to climb through the field.

Senna pitted because of handling troubles of his Lotus 99T and so Prost went into the lead. When Prost stopped for fresh tyres the lead was briefly passed to Thierry Boutsen, who was performing admirably with his Benetton-Ford, but his lead lasted less than half a lap before Piquet went back to first before his second stop, on lap 21. Prost then went ahead again and led for the rest of the race, never looking threatened as he preserved his tyres to only require two stops, while his rivals Senna and Piquet had three.

Mansell&#x27;s race was compromised late in the race by a tyre puncture, who sent him back to seventh place. On lap 51 Senna suffered an engine failure, causing him to retire from the second place he held for much of the race despite problems with the Lotus&#x27;s active suspensions. Senna, who pulled off the track in front of the pits, reported that his engine had not actually blown, but that he could feel it was seizing and felt it would be better to retire rather than to destroy the engine.

Prost won ahead of Piquet, his teammate Stefan Johansson, Gerhard Berger (who battled for the whole race with handling problems of his Ferrari F1/87), Boutsen and Mansell, who caught the last point. Satoru Nakajima&#x27;s first Grand Prix, saw him finish just outside the points in seventh in his Lotus. This was Prost&#x27;s 26th victory, which made him the second most successful Grand Prix winner at the time, moving him ahead of Jim Clark and just one win behind tying with Jackie Stewart as the most successful.

<text>The 1987 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 3 May 1987 at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari, Imola. It was the second race of the 1987 Formula One season. It was the seventh San Marino Grand Prix and it was held over 59 laps of the five kilometre circuit for a race distance of 297 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Nigel Mansell driving a Williams FW11B. It was Mansell&#x27;s eighth Grand Prix victory, his first (of two) at the Imola circuit. Mansell finished 27 seconds ahead of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna driving a Lotus 99T. Third was Italian driver Michele Alboreto driving a Ferrari F1/87. The win gave Mansell a one-point lead in the championship over French McLaren driver Alain Prost.

==Race summary==
In Friday practice, championship contender Nelson Piquet was eliminated from the race after an accident at the Tamburello corner. A tyre of his Williams FW11B failed, which resulted in a violent impact against the wall (when the car was returned to the pits, Williams designer Patrick Head could not confirm if the crash was a fault with the FW11B as half the rear end had been torn off by the impact, while both Head and Nigel Mansell were seen talking a good look at Piquet&#x27;s wreck). Whilst in his opinion he had only sustained a sore ankle, he was taken to the nearby Bellaria-Igea Marina hospital, and after medical checks he was forbidden to start by FIA Medical Delegate Sid Watkins. For the remainder of the weekend Piquet worked as a guest commentator on Italian television. Years later he revealed that he was &quot;never quite right&quot; after the accident, suffering headaches and sometimes double vision and for the rest of the 1987 season secretly visited the hospital for treatment. He did this in secret for fear that he would not be allowed to race either by Williams or Watkins.

Alarmed by reports from other drivers of excessive tyre blistering and the suggestion that Piquet&#x27;s accident may have been caused by a tyre deflation, Goodyear withdrew all the tyres issued to teams (the original compounds taken to Imola were actually different to those supplied for a scheduled test at the circuit the week prior to the race). A replacement selection of the tyres used in the Imola test were flown in from England (with some also brought in from the nearby Ferrari factory in Maranello) and despite the lack of Customs officials due to an Italian public holiday, the new rubber was available for all teams by the Saturday morning practice session.

Saturday&#x27;s qualifying went on smoothly, with Ayrton Senna claiming pole position on his Lotus 99T, the first ever pole position for an active suspension car and also the last pole position for the original Lotus team, with Mansell alongside him in the front row. The second row was occupied by Teo Fabi in the Benetton B187 and Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren MP4/3; &quot;home&quot; team Ferrari took the whole third row with Michele Alboreto ahead of Gerhard Berger.

The race required two starts as Martin Brundle (Zakspeed 871), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton B187) and Eddie Cheever (Arrows A10) stalled on the original grid. Satoru Nakajima started from the pit lane owing to a faulty battery in his Lotus, and René Arnoux failed to take the second start after the suspension of his Ligier JS29B failed.

At the second start, Senna led off the line, but Mansell overtook him on lap two, at the Tosa corner, and went on to dominate the race. Prost took second place by overtaking Senna on lap 6; the Brazilian was then engaged in a battle with the two Ferraris, and took back second when Prost surprisingly retired with an alternator failure on lap 15. Berger retired with turbo boost failure on lap 17, and by that time Alboreto passed Senna to take second place.

On lap 22, Mansell pitted early due to a loose wheel balance weight and for three laps Alboreto led the race to the delight of the Tifosi. Senna retook first position with Alboreto&#x27;s pit stop, then before Mansell returned to the front when the Brazilian stopped. Riccardo Patrese in his Brabham BT56 was now holding second place but he retired when his alternator failed on lap 57. Simultaneously, Teo Fabi retired with engine problems. Fabi&#x27;s race had been wrecked by front wing damage sustained on the first lap when he collided with Cheever, although his attempted fightback did produce the fastest lap.

Mansell took a comfortable win with Senna holding second after Alboreto&#x27;s turbo experienced problems. Alboreto salvaged a 3rd place finish, which would end up being the last podium Enzo Ferrari personally saw his Formula One team score, as he only attended Grand Prix races in Italy, and would die 15 months later. Stefan Johansson (McLaren MP4/3) was in fourth place whilst Derek Warwick&#x27;s late race retirement after his Arrows A10 ran out of fuel, handed fifth to Brundle for what would the only time in 5 seasons (1985-1989) that a Zakspeed would finish a race in the points. Nakajima rounded off the points in sixth place, which meant he was the first Japanese driver to score a world championship point.

<doc id="1122979" wikidata="Q20928" url="?curid=1122979" title="1987 Belgian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1987 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 17 May 1987 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Francorchamps, Wallonia. Contested over 43 laps, the race was the 45th Belgian Grand Prix, the 33rd to be held at Spa and the fourth since the circuit was redeveloped in 1979, and the third race of the 1987 Formula One season.

The race was won by France&#x27;s Alain Prost driving a McLaren-TAG. This was Prost&#x27;s second victory of the 1987 season and his second in the Belgian Grand Prix (after 1983), as well as his 27th Grand Prix victory overall, equalling Jackie Stewart&#x27;s all-time record. Prost&#x27;s Swedish team-mate Stefan Johansson finished second, the only other driver on the same lap, giving McLaren their first 1-2 finish since the previous year&#x27;s Monaco Grand Prix. Italy&#x27;s Andrea de Cesaris, driving a Brabham-BMW, finished third despite having to push his car over the line as he had run out of fuel.

The win gave Prost a five-point lead over Johansson in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Williams driver Nigel Mansell was three points further back; a first-lap collision with Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus had ultimately led to his retirement from the race, after which he angrily confronted the Brazilian driver in the Lotus garage.

==Race summary==
Qualifying runs saw the two Williams FW11Bs take the front row, with Nigel Mansell on the pole, nearly 1.5 seconds faster than Nelson Piquet. Certainly, Piquet was still suffering the results of his accident at Imola. Ayrton Senna took the third place in his Lotus 99T ahead of the two Ferrari F1/87s of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto.

The race required two starts. On the first start Mansell took the lead ahead of Senna, Piquet and Alboreto. At the back of the grid René Arnoux (Ligier JS29B) and Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham BT56) tangled, whilst Thierry Boutsen (Benetton B187) hit Berger&#x27;s spinning Ferrari F1/87. A more serious accident befell Philippe Streiff who crashed heavily at the Eau Rouge before the wreckage was hit by Tyrrell teammate Jonathan Palmer; both were unhurt but their Tyrrell DG016s were reduced to scrap. By virtue of qualifying 23rd to his teammate&#x27;s 24th, and ironically by crashing first, Streiff was given the spare car for the restart forcing Palmer out of the race.

On the second start, Senna led Mansell away, but during lap one the Briton tried to overtake the Brazilian. The two controversially tangled, leading to the retirement of the Lotus 99T. Mansell rejoined the race at the back, until the damage sustained in the collision finally forced him to retire on lap 17. Mansell subsequently visited the Lotus garage where harsh words were exchanged and punches were thrown.

Berger retired on lap three with a broken piston whilst on lap 10 second place Michele Alboreto&#x27;s wheel bearing broke and Nelson Piquet retired with a broken turbo pipe, handing the lead to Alain Prost from Teo Fabi and Stefan Johansson. The pitstops changed little in the situation, and he maintained this to win easily by 25 seconds, despite concerns with his fuel consumption due to a faulty gauge.

This was Prost&#x27;s 27th win, equalling Jackie Stewart&#x27;s record with team-mate Johansson making it a McLaren 1-2. Andrea de Cesaris drove superbly to finish third for Brabham despite having to push his car over the line with Eddie Cheever (Arrows A10), Satoru Nakajima (Lotus 99T) and Arnoux taking the remaining points. With the setbacks to the Tyrrell drivers, the Jim Clark points were won by the Lola LC87 of Philippe Alliot. , this was also the last time that the Belgian Grand Prix was held at the beginning of the season; since 1988, it has always been held in August or September.

<text>The 1987 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the 45e Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held on 31 May 1987 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo. It was the fourth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship.

The 78-lap race was won by Ayrton Senna, driving a Lotus-Honda. It was the first of an eventual six wins for the Brazilian driver at Monaco. Compatriot Nelson Piquet was second in a Williams-Honda, with Italian Michele Alboreto third in a Ferrari.

The win promoted Senna to second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, three points behind McLaren driver Alain Prost.

==Race summary==
Traditionally the number of competitors permitted for the Monaco Grand Prix was lower than at all other races, due to the tight and twisty nature of the Monte Carlo circuit. Originally 16, it was later increased to 20. For 1987, however, it was increased to a full grid of 26. According to FISA, this move was made in order to bring the race into line with the other races on the F1 calendar, but there were cynical views that it was made in order to reduce the number of non-qualifiers to appease team sponsors. There was widespread concern about the results of overcrowding on the track and the speed difference of various cars.

During the practice session, Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari tangled with Christian Danner&#x27;s slow-moving Zakspeed on the uphill section after the Ste-Devote corner. Alboreto&#x27;s car was thrown in the air and caught fire, but landed back on the track. FISA blamed Danner for the accident and decided to exclude him from the weekend, the first such event in the history of the Formula One World Championship. There were widespread objections throughout the paddock, particularly as there were several other practice accidents and it was felt that Danner had no more to blame than any other driver involved in these accidents. Alboreto himself believed that Danner was not to blame for the accident.

Nigel Mansell took pole position in the Williams, with Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus alongside on the front row and Nelson Piquet third in the other Williams. At the start, Mansell led away from Senna, Piquet, Alboreto and Alain Prost in the McLaren. Mansell led until lap 30 when he retired with a loss of turbo boost; Senna then led for the remainder of the race; despite making a pit stop for tyres.

Senna eventually won by 33 seconds from Piquet. Prost was running third when his engine failed with three laps to go, promoting Alboreto to the final podium position. Gerhard Berger finished fourth in the other Ferrari, with the top six completed by the first two naturally-aspirated finishers, Jonathan Palmer in the Tyrrell and Ivan Capelli in the March.

Senna&#x27;s victory was the first for a car with active suspension.

<text>The 1987 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 5 July 1987 at the Circuit Paul Ricard, Le Castellet. It was the sixth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 65th French Grand Prix and the eleventh to be held at Paul Ricard, and the second to be held on the shortened version of the circuit. The race was held over 80 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by British driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda, after he started from pole position. Mansell took his second victory of the season by 7.7 seconds from Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet, with local driver Alain Prost third in a McLaren-TAG.

Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Brazilian Ayrton Senna, finished fourth in his Lotus-Honda, which was enough for him to retain the championship lead by one point over Prost, with Piquet and Mansell three and six points behind respectively.

==Race summary==

===Qualifying===
For the first time since the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix, a non-Honda powered car was on the front row in the shape of the McLaren-TAG of Alain Prost, who qualified second. The pole position was taken once again by Nigel Mansell in his Williams-Honda, while the second row was occupied by Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Honda and Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams. The fast nature of the circuit clearly suited the turbo cars: the best placed non-turbo driver was Ivan Capelli in the March 871 in 22nd place, about six seconds off the pace and slower on the Mistral Straight than the Williams-Hondas.

Showing the advances in engine development, aerodynamics and tyres, on his pole lap Mansell was timed at on the Mistral. Even though the Mistral used in 1987 was some 800 metres shorter than when Formula One last used the full circuit at Paul Ricard in 1985, the sheer acceleration and top speed of the Williams-Hondas was comparable to the top speeds seen at the circuit from the season cars.

During qualifying Arrows driver Derek Warwick gave a view on the strength of the turbocharged Honda RA167-E V6 engine and the acceleration advantage Williams had over the field since the opening round in Brazil. He noted that on one lap he entered the Mistral approximately 50 metres ahead of Piquet&#x27;s Williams. Despite the known power of the Megatron (formerly BMW) turbo, Warwick claimed by the time they got to Signes just over one kilometre later the acceleration of the Honda had seen Piquet around 100 metres ahead of the Arrows A10.

===Race===
At the lights, Michele Alboreto jumped the start, whilst his Ferrari teammate Gerhard Berger stalled. Nigel Mansell led away and was joined by teammate Nelson Piquet at the front after he passed Prost on the Mistral Straight. Eddie Cheever retired his Arrows A10 on lap one after accidentally setting off the fire extinguisher whilst attempting to adjust the turbo boost. Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham BT56) then collided with Stefan Johansson, the McLaren requiring a pit stop for a damaged nosecone; the debris of his car caused some trouble to Mansell who ran into them.

Mansell, Piquet and Prost were engaged in a gripping battle for the lead, separated by just two seconds. On lap 19, Piquet spun and Prost passed him for second. Meanwhile, Senna was holding onto a creditable fourth place. On lap 30, Piquet pitted for new tyres, followed two laps later by Senna. Meanwhile, Thierry Boutsen (Benetton B187) retired with electrical failure. Both Mansell and Prost came in for new tyres on lap 36, handing the lead to Piquet. Mansell completed his stop and closed rapidly on Piquet, breaking fastest lap records. On lap 46, at the Le Beausset corner, Piquet made an error and Mansell passed him on the inside to take a lead he would not lose. On lap 65 Piquet made a second stop which went wrong when the engine stalled, delaying him by an additional eight seconds. After exiting the pits, he caught and passed Prost (who was dealing with an electrical problem) on lap 67.

Piquet was about 20 seconds behind Mansell, but on the final laps he was gaining at two seconds a lap. With seven laps to go, the gap was reduced to just 13 seconds, but Mansell paced himself to win by 7.7 seconds. Johansson had fought courageously up to sixth place after two pit stops to repair damages on his McLaren, but retired just five laps from the chequered flag.

In his home race, Prost took the final podium place some 48 seconds behind Piquet. Senna finished fourth ahead of Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton B187 in fifth. Philippe Streiff drove a superb race to take his first World Championship point and the victory for the Jim Clark Trophy in his Tyrrell-Ford.

<text>The 1987 British Grand Prix (formally the XL Shell Oils British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 July 1987 at the Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone. It was the seventh race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 42nd British Grand Prix and the 23rd to be held at Silverstone. The race was held over 65 laps of the circuit for race distance of .

The race was won by local driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. In one of his most memorable Formula One performances, Mansell hunted down Brazilian team-mate Nelson Piquet, who had started from pole position, with three laps remaining. It was Mansell&#x27;s third win of the season, and his second consecutive British Grand Prix victory. Ayrton Senna finished third in his Lotus-Honda, one lap behind.

The win moved Mansell into second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, level on points with Piquet and one point behind Senna.

==Qualifying report==
As usual, Honda-powered cars dominated the qualifying sessions, with Nelson Piquet taking pole position and Ayrton Senna third in his Lotus despite being a full second slower than Mansell. Alain Prost was fourth in his McLaren, while the Benettons of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi were fifth and sixth, and the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger seventh and eighth. Completing the top ten were Andrea de Cesaris in the Brabham and Stefan Johansson in the second McLaren.

During qualifying, Piercarlo Ghinzani&#x27;s Ligier ran out of fuel in front of the pits. His mechanics jumped the pit wall, refuelled him on the track and then push-started him, a clear violation of the rules leading to Ghinzani&#x27;s exclusion from the remainder of the event. Before the incident, the Italian had set a time which would have put him 19th on the grid.

==Race report==
At the start, Prost was the quickest and took the lead, only to be passed by Piquet at Maggotts; Mansell soon followed his teammate. The race then developed into a battle between the two Williams drivers, with Piquet leading.

On lap 35, Mansell was around two seconds behind his teammate. Both Williams drivers were scheduled to complete the race without a tyre change, but Mansell and the team elected to make a stop to change tyres. Mansell rejoined the race some 29 seconds behind Piquet, with 28 laps remaining. On fresh rubber, Mansell began an epic charge, breaking the lap record eight times to the delight of the over 100,000 strong British crowd.

By lap 62 Mansell was right on Piquet&#x27;s tail, and on lap 63 the Englishman overtook his teammate. Shortly after crossing the finish line, Mansell&#x27;s car slowed down and was engulfed by the crowd. Initially it was thought that he had run out of fuel, but he had actually blown up the engine, out of the stress of running the last 6 laps on &quot;Q&quot; mode (which gives the engine +100 hp), and risking running out of fuel at any moment (his fuel display was reading &quot;minus 2.5 laps&quot;). In fact that incident was the last straw for the patience of the Honda management, since it had – again – threatened their easily attainable 1-2 result. Honda would switch their supply of engines from Williams to McLaren for 1988, while Piquet would sign for Lotus – also running Hondas – in the following weeks. Senna finished third, one lap down, with a further lap back to teammate Satoru Nakajima in fourth. Derek Warwick was fifth in the Arrows-Megatron, with Fabi completing the top six.

<text>The 1987 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 26 July 1987. It was the eighth round of the 1987 Formula One season. It was the 49th German Grand Prix and the eleventh to be held at the Hockenheimring. It was held over 44 laps of the seven kilometre circuit for a race distance of 298.760 km (185.812 mi).

==Pre-race==
In the week leading up to the German Grand Prix a number of teams tested at the Hockenheim circuit. During testing Ayrton Senna had a very lucky escape when he had a rear tyre failure at over on the long straight leading to the Bremsschikane. The rear corner of his Lotus 99T was destroyed and parts were reported to be hard to find as most ended up flying off into the forest. As a result of the crash Goodyear took the precaution of immediately flying in new compound tyres from their plant in Akron in the United States in time for the Grand Prix weekend.

The tyre failure was determined to be the result of Senna picking up a puncture late on his previous lap. However the Lotus&#x27; active suspension system compensated for that and kept the car at its correct ride height, masking the problem from Senna. This caused many to question the system as the general belief was that with a passively suspended car Senna would have known he had a puncture and would not have continued to drive at high speed.

==Race==
The race was won by eventual 1987 World Champion, Nelson Piquet driving a Williams FW11B. It was his first win of the season and his third win in the German Grand Prix having previously won for Brabham in 1981, and Williams in the previous year. Piquet won by over a minute and a half from Swedish driver Stefan Johansson driving a McLaren MP4/3, who coasted over the finish line on three wheels due to a tyre puncture suffered just past the pits on his last lap. The Swede&#x27;s second place was the 50th podium finish for the Porsche-designed TAG turbo engine. Piquet inherited the win after engine failure claimed his team-mate, Briton Nigel Mansell, and reigning champion, Frenchman Alain Prost (McLaren MP4/3). Ayrton Senna finished third in his Lotus 99T.

Just seven cars were classified at the end of the race, as the long straights took their toll on engine reliability. Naturally aspirated cars finished as high as fourth place with Frenchman Philippe Streiff leading home a team one-two in the Jim Clark/Colin Chapman Trophy standings for Tyrrell as Jonathan Palmer finished in fifth place. In sixth was French driver Philippe Alliot driving a Lola LC87 for the new Larrousse team. It was Alliot&#x27;s second top six finish in Formula One and Larrousse&#x27;s first world championship point, although the Constructor&#x27;s Championship point would be credited to the chassis designers, Lola Cars.

Piquet&#x27;s win vaulted him into the championship lead for the first time in 1987, putting him four points ahead of Senna and nine ahead of Mansell.

<text>The 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hungaroring on 9 August 1987. It was the ninth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. The race was held over 76 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Williams-Honda. His teammate, Briton Nigel Mansell, took pole position and led until he lost a wheel nut with six laps remaining. Piquet&#x27;s compatriot Ayrton Senna finished second in a Lotus-Honda, with Frenchman Alain Prost third in a McLaren-TAG.

The win, Piquet&#x27;s second in succession, extended his lead over Senna in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to seven points, with Mansell and Prost a further eleven points back.

==Race summary==
Before the race, Ayrton Senna informed Lotus that he would be leaving the team at the end of the year. Almost immediately, Lotus signed Senna&#x27;s fellow Brazilian and Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Nelson Piquet, who explained that he felt that Williams had not honoured his number one driver status in the team.

Piquet went on to take his second consecutive win in his Williams-Honda. Senna finished second in his Lotus-Honda but 37 seconds behind Piquet, while Alain Prost took third in his McLaren-TAG.

Thierry Boutsen finished fourth in his Benetton-Ford, ahead of the Brabham-BMW of Riccardo Patrese. The final championship point was claimed by Derek Warwick in his Arrows-Megatron, who was battling with influenza and conjunctivitis. Jonathan Palmer claimed the Jim Clark Trophy points finishing seventh in his Tyrrell DG016 with teammate Philippe Streiff finishing ninth behind the second Arrows of Eddie Cheever. Italian driver Ivan Capelli was tenth in the March 871.

The win allowed Piquet to expand his championship points lead to seven over Senna and 18 over Mansell.

<doc id="1122989" wikidata="Q15587" url="?curid=1122989" title="1987 Austrian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1987 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 16 August 1987. It was the tenth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the twentieth Austrian Grand Prix, and the last to be held until . The race was run over 52 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of , also being the last race in the original track.

The race needed to be restarted twice following crashes on the starting grid. It was eventually won by British driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. Mansell took his third victory of the season by 56 seconds from Brazilian teammate Nelson Piquet, with Italian Teo Fabi third in a Benetton-Ford.

==Race summary==
The race was plagued with accidents. The first major incident came when Stefan Johansson hit a deer with his McLaren MP4/3 after it wandered onto the circuit during Friday practice. The terrified deer was crossing the track to seek refuge from the noise of the cars when it was struck by Johansson traveling at close to , killing it instantly. The McLaren left front suspension was broken in the impact causing it to spear off into the guardrail and all four corners of the car, as well as the carbon fibre monocoque were destroyed. Johansson was fortunate to escape with little more than a headache, though he was later flown by helicopter to a hospital in Klagenfurt for x-rays after complaining of headaches and neck pains. His crash caused McLaren to have to fly a spare car overnight from the team&#x27;s base in Woking. Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams-Honda had collided with the AGS of Pascal Fabre, ending with the Williams impacting in the wall.

The first race start ended quickly after the Zakspeed of Martin Brundle crashed, then the two Tyrrells of Jonathan Palmer and Philippe Streiff collided in the ensuing chaos with Piercarlo Ghinzani also crashing his Ligier. The second attempt to start was more serious. Mansell on the front row crawled away with clutch problems and the grid compacted behind him. The Österreichring&#x27;s narrow front straight saw to the rest when Eddie Cheever (Arrows) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham) collided and half the grid, including Johansson, Alex Caffi (Osella), Ivan Capelli (March), Pascal Fabre, Philippe Alliot (Larrousse-Lola), and both Zakspeeds of Brundle and Christian Danner were involved in the ensuing pile-up.

For the third start Streiff was missing as Tyrrell had simply run out of usable cars and Palmer got the use of the surviving DG016 as he had qualified higher than his team mate (exactly the reverse of the situation earlier in the year in Belgium when Palmer was forced to sit out the restart with both race Tyrrells wrecked, Streiff got the spare as he had qualified ahead of Palmer). Several drivers were in repaired cars or in spare cars, including Ayrton Senna after a CV joint failed in his Lotus during the second start. The third start, over two hours late, continued to claim cars. Alain Prost (McLaren) had an electrical failure as the warm-up lap began. The team mechanics got the car going and Prost started from the pitlane along with Senna and the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto. The third attempt to start had no problems although Johansson soon pitted with a puncture then had a tyre fall off on his out lap after a chaotic pitstop. Johansson made it back to the pits and resumed.

Piquet led early from Thierry Boutsen in his Benetton and Mansell. Boutsen pitted with gear linking problems and Mansell leapt past Piquet while negotiating lapped cars on the straight leading into the Bosch Kurve. Fabi (Benetton) was a lap down in third ahead of Boutsen in a season best result for the team. Recovering from their difficulties, Senna, Prost and Johansson finished fifth, sixth and seventh. Ghinzani was eighth for Ligier ahead of Danner and René Arnoux in the second Ligier. Sixteen cars finished although Fabre had not completed enough laps to be classified and 14th placed Brundle would be disqualified for a bodywork infringement on the spare Zakspeed 871, pressed into service after the startline collisions.

<text>The 1987 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 6 September 1987. It was the eleventh race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 57th Italian Grand Prix and the 52nd to be held at Monza. The race was held over 50 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won from pole position by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet, driving a Williams-Honda. Piquet took his third victory of the season by 1.8 seconds from compatriot Ayrton Senna, who led in his Lotus-Honda before running wide at the Parabolica with eight laps to go. Piquet&#x27;s British team-mate, Nigel Mansell, finished third, nearly 50 seconds adrift. It was also the sixth consecutive victory for the Williams team, a run of wins that had begun at the French Grand Prix in early July.

French Tyrrell driver Philippe Streiff was the first naturally aspirated Jim Clark Trophy car to finish in 12th, three laps down on Piquet.

The win strengthened Piquet&#x27;s championship points lead to 14 points over Senna and 20 over Mansell.

During qualifying, Piquet recorded a speed of , the fastest achieved by a Formula One car during the first turbo era of the sport (1977-88). Like Lotus, Williams had been working on their own computer controlled Active suspension. However, unlike Lotus who had been running theirs all season on the 99T in a bid to try and gain a technical advantage, this was the debut Grand Prix for the Williams version, called &quot;Williams Reactive Ride&quot; (Lotus allegedly had a legal copyright on the Active Suspension name), with Williams Technical Director Patrick Head preferring to get the system right before trying to figure it out on the run in the limited time available during a race meeting. Nigel Mansell had little faith in the system after disastrous results with the original Lotus Active Suspension in –. Piquet&#x27;s faith in the suspension system however was absolute after completing a full race distance test session at Imola (albeit on a virtually deserted track), finishing 3 minutes faster than Mansell&#x27;s win there earlier in the year. By using the Reactive car, Piquet was able to run less wing than his team mate and was over faster through the speed trap than Mansell in the passive FW11B.

Due to the entries of AGS and Coloni, for the first time in the 1987 season, there would be drivers who would fail to qualify for the race - in this case, it was to be Nicola Larini in the Coloni and Pascal Fabre in the AGS.

<text>The 1987 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 20 September 1987. It was the twelfth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 16th Portuguese Grand Prix and the fourth to be held at Estoril. The race was held over 70 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-TAG, after he started from third position. Austrian driver Gerhard Berger took pole position in his Ferrari and led for most of the race, until he spun with three laps remaining. Prost duly went through to take his 28th Grand Prix victory, surpassing Jackie Stewart&#x27;s all-time record; he also achieved his 54th podium finish, equalling Niki Lauda&#x27;s record. Berger finished second, some 20 seconds behind Prost, with Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Brazilian Nelson Piquet, third in his Williams-Honda.

The race was marred by a multi-car collision on the opening lap. Piquet and Michele Alboreto (Ferrari F1/87) collided at the start, with Derek Warwick (Arrows A10), Satoru Nakajima (Lotus 99T), Martin Brundle (Zakspeed 871), Christian Danner (Zakspeed 871), Philippe Alliot (Lola LC87), René Arnoux (Ligier JS29C) and Adrián Campos (Minardi M186) all involved in the ensuing accident. Only Danner was unable to restart as the Zakspeed team had only one usable car which went to Brundle.

With Piquet finishing third ahead of both Mansell and Senna, Piquet expanded his championship points lead to 18 points over Senna and 24 over Mansell.

<text>The 1987 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jerez on 27 September 1987. It was the thirteenth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 29th Spanish Grand Prix and the second to be held at Jerez. The race was held over 72 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won from pole position by British driver Nigel Mansell, driving a Williams-Honda. It was Mansell&#x27;s fifth victory of 1987 and the eighth for the Williams team, securing them their second consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship and fourth in all. Frenchman Alain Prost finished second in a McLaren-TAG, some 22 seconds behind Mansell, with Swedish teammate Stefan Johansson third. Mansell&#x27;s teammate and Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Brazilian Nelson Piquet, finished fourth. Prost achieved his 55th podium finish at this race, surpassing the record of Niki Lauda.

The win moved Mansell ahead of Ayrton Senna, who finished fifth in his Lotus-Honda, into second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, albeit 18 points behind Piquet with three races remaining.

== Summary ==
Nelson Piquet secured his 24th and final F1 pole position in his Williams-Honda with Nigel Mansell completing an all-Williams front row. The race was comfortably won by Mansell who passed Piquet at the end of the first lap and was never headed. The battle for third (then second) was led for much of the time by Ayrton Senna, who like the previous year tried to complete the race without changing tyres. Both Senna and Lotus were of the opinion that the 99T&#x27;s computerised active suspension system would help preserve his tyres throughout the race.

Senna had a queue of both Ferraris, Prost&#x27;s McLaren and Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton behind him, which was joined by Piquet after a long pit-stop. For lap after lap, Senna held off all-comers, similar to Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s performance in his Ferrari at Jarama for the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix. The Lotus-Honda was very fast in a straight line with a low downforce setup, but was slow through Jerez&#x27;s many twists and turns as a result. Senna&#x27;s pursuers could not pass him on the long pit straight, and with Jerez generally having a lot of dust and sand off the racing line, they were not able pass him through the corners without losing grip.

However, Piquet&#x27;s similarly powered Williams was able to get by (not before having a spin) followed eventually by Boutsen and Prost as the Brazilian&#x27;s tyres finally went off. Senna faded to finish fifth, but the battle for second continued between Boutsen and Piquet - Boutsen went out avoiding Piquet who was rejoining the track after having gone off - and then between Piquet and Prost, with Prost getting the better of the Williams driver who also lost third place to McLaren&#x27;s Stefan Johansson who put in another strong drive. Both Ferraris blew their engines.

Martin Brundle, who finished 11th in his Zakspeed, described his drive as &quot;the time I got out the car thinking no human could have done [any] better&quot;.

<text>The 1987 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City on 18 October 1987. It was the fourteenth race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. It was the 11th Mexican Grand Prix and the second since the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez was renovated and returned to the World Championship calendar.

The race was held over a total of 63 laps of the circuit for a race distance of . The race was divided into two heats after British driver Derek Warwick crashed his Arrows A10 heavily exiting the high-speed Peraltada corner on lap 31 after a rear suspension failure; the Arrows car&#x27;s rear suspension was weakened by Satoru Nakajima crashing his Lotus-Honda straight into the back of Warwick&#x27;s car at the end of the main straight earlier in the race. The results of the first 30 laps were combined with the results of the second race of 33 laps to create a combined result.

The race was won by British driver Nigel Mansell driving a Williams FW11B. Mansell&#x27;s combined time over the 63 laps was 26 seconds faster than his Brazilian teammate and eventual 1987 World Champion, Nelson Piquet. Piquet actually took the chequered flag first at the end of the second heat, but Mansell&#x27;s lead over Piquet at the time of Warwick&#x27;s accident was substantially larger. Piquet had been delayed after a collision with Alain Prost (McLaren MP4/3) on the first lap.

It was Mansell&#x27;s sixth and last Grand Prix victory for the 1987 season. Riccardo Patrese finished third driving a Brabham BT56. It was Patrese&#x27;s best result since finishing third in the 1984 Italian Grand Prix. It was just the second podium of the year for Brabham. Brabham would only score one more podium before it would fold in 1992.

Attrition bit heavily into the race with just fifteen cars taking the second race start. Nine survived to the finish. Naturally aspirated Jim Clark Trophy cars climbed into the points with Philippe Alliot (Lola LC87) taking his third top six result for the year.

Ayrton Senna was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after they refused to push his stalled car.

Mansell&#x27;s victory allowed him to close to within twelve points of his championship leading teammate. With just two races left, only the Williams drivers had enough points to win the championship.

== Classification ==
During Saturday morning&#x27;s 90 minute free practice session, a number of the turbo teams ran their cars at the 2.5 Bar boost limit that would be enforced in . To the surprise of many, lap times actually proved faster than they would in the afternoon&#x27;s qualifying session when the cars were running their full 4.0 Bar boost settings.

<text>The 1987 Japanese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Suzuka on 1 November 1987. It was the fifteenth and penultimate race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship. 

The race was won by Austrian driver Gerhard Berger driving a Ferrari F1/87. It was the end of a 38-race losing streak for Formula One&#x27;s most famous team and Berger&#x27;s second Grand Prix victory having won the Mexican Grand Prix the previous year driving for Benetton. Berger won by 17 seconds over Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna driving a Lotus 99T. Third was the McLaren MP4/3 of Swedish driver Stefan Johansson. This would turn out to be Team Lotus&#x27;s last second place finish.

==Background ==
The 1987 Japanese Grand Prix was the first race to be held in Japan since James Hunt won in his McLaren at Fuji, in 1977. This time, the Grand Prix circus utilised the Honda-owned Suzuka Circuit, which originated as a test track for Honda motorcycles and automobiles. 

Soichiro Honda was extremely enthusiastic about this race, and told his racing engineers &quot;We have to win. And we have to keep winning...&quot; aiming for a hometown victory at Honda&#x27;s home track in its native Japan. Soichiro Honda had reason for optimism as four of the entrants were powered by Honda-made engines. The Lotus 99Ts of Ayrton Senna, who had won races earlier in the season and was joined on Team Lotus with national favourite Satoru Nakajima, along with the dominating Williams FW11Bs driven by Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet, who were both vying for the overall championship. 

== Qualifying ==
The scene was set for a tense championship-deciding race between the Williams-Honda teammates, bitter rivals Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. However, Mansell suffered a huge crash during Friday qualifying while trying to better Piquet&#x27;s time, which put him out of action for both the Japanese race and the subsequent Australian Grand Prix. As a consequence, Piquet won his third World Championship before the race even began.

Qualifying once again demonstrated the return to form of Ferrari, as Gerhard Berger obtained his second pole position of the season, with the F1/87 being perfectly suited to the Suzuka circuit. Alain Prost qualified 2nd in his McLaren-TAG with Thierry Boutsen 3rd in his Benetton-Ford. Following Mansell&#x27;s Friday crash, the three remaining Honda-powered cars of Piquet, Senna, and local favourite Satoru Nakajima, could only qualify in 5th, 7th and 11th places respectively. All drivers from 8th position and below moved up one position on the grid due to Mansell being unable to start. This also meant Roberto Moreno was permitted to race the AGS despite having the 27th fastest qualifying time.

Out of the 26 drivers who qualified for the race, only Riccardo Patrese had ever driven in a Japanese Grand Prix prior to 1987, having taken part of the 1977 race at Fuji.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
At the start Berger immediately imposed his authority by building a cushion. Prost, in his McLaren, perhaps the only driver capable of challenging Berger for the victory, suffered a puncture on the first lap and, therefore, was out of contention. Prost, however, drove a superb race to climb up through the field finishing just outside the points with the consolation of having the fastest lap. Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton ran second early on but could not live with the pace set by Berger, ultimately fading to fifth. Piquet spent much of the race behind Senna&#x27;s Lotus but was unable to find a way past his countryman. The new world champion eventually retired in the pits with oil pouring from the rear of his Williams. At one stage Stefan Johansson in the McLaren closed on Berger, but the Austrian driver responded and eventually romped to a seemingly effortless victory, the first Ferrari&#x27;s victory since the 1985 German Grand Prix. Ayrton Senna dramatically passed Johansson on the last lap to take second place. Michele Alboreto, in the second Ferrari, got away very slowly at the green lights leaving him towards the rear of the field. However, the Italian drove an aggressive race to climb his way back up the order to finish an excellent fourth despite suffering from a dragging undertray causing a huge amount of sparks. Boutsen and Nakajima rounded out the points.

Johansson&#x27;s third place was the 54th and last podium finish for the Porsche-designed TAG turbo V6 engine which had been first used in Formula One by McLaren at the 1983 Dutch Grand Prix.

<text>The 1987 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Adelaide on 15 November 1987. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1987 Formula One World Championship.

The 82-lap race was won by Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, who started from pole position and led every lap in his Ferrari. The win would end up being the last Ferrari win during team founder Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s life, who would die in August of the following year. Brazilian Ayrton Senna finished second in his Lotus-Honda but was subsequently disqualified, thus promoting Berger&#x27;s Italian teammate Michele Alboreto to second and the Benetton-Ford of Belgian Thierry Boutsen to third.

==Background==
Nigel Mansell was still recovering from his accident in the previous race in Japan and so Riccardo Patrese, who had already signed for Williams to partner Mansell in 1988, was given permission by Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone to stand in for the Briton in this race; he was replaced at Brabham by Formula 3000 champion Stefano Modena, making his Formula One debut.

==Qualifying report==
Despite being ill during qualifying, Gerhard Berger took pole position in his Ferrari by 0.7 seconds from Alain Prost in the McLaren. In his final race for Williams Nelson Piquet took third, with compatriot Ayrton Senna fourth in his final race for Lotus; they were followed by Thierry Boutsen in the Benetton and Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari. Patrese was seventh in the second Williams, with Stefan Johansson in the second McLaren, Teo Fabi in the second Benetton and Andrea de Cesaris in the Brabham completing the top ten. Modena took 15th, just behind Satoru Nakajima in the second Lotus.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the green light, Piquet darted past Berger to take the lead into the first chicane, whilst Alessandro Nannini in the Minardi was out immediately after crashing into the wall on the exit. A confident Berger, fresh from his victory in the previous race in Japan, re-passed Piquet at Wakefield Corner and began to pull away from the field.

Early retirements included Philippe Streiff spinning off in his Tyrrell on lap 7 and Nakajima suffering a hydraulics failure on lap 23. Modena&#x27;s debut ended on lap 32 when he stopped in the pits due to exhaustion.

The battle for second between Piquet, Prost, Alboreto and Senna changed little until lap 35, when Piquet pitted for tyres and dropped to sixth. On lap 42, Prost found himself baulked by former teammate René Arnoux in the Ligier on the pit straight and Alboreto slipped through, before Senna powered past both the McLaren and the Ferrari.

Attrition kicked in as the race continued, with brakes in particular becoming a big issue. Fabi was the first brake-related retirement on lap 47, followed by Johansson on lap 49 and Prost on lap 54. Piquet&#x27;s brakes also failed on lap 59, leaving Berger, Senna and Alboreto as the top three followed by Boutsen and Patrese.

In the latter stages of the race Senna made a charge, closing to within eight seconds of Berger, before the Austrian pulled away again, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 72. Berger crossed the finish line just under 35 seconds ahead of Senna, with Alboreto the only other driver on the lead lap and Boutsen, Jonathan Palmer in the second Tyrrell and Yannick Dalmas in the Larrousse completing the top six after Patrese suffered a late oil leak.

In post-race scrutineering it was discovered that the brake ducts on Senna&#x27;s Lotus were oversized, resulting in his disqualification from the race. Alboreto was duly promoted to second, giving Ferrari a 1-2 finish, with Boutsen third, Palmer fourth, Dalmas fifth and Roberto Moreno sixth, scoring the AGS team&#x27;s first World Championship point. The only other classified finishers were Christian Danner in the Zakspeed, de Cesaris and Patrese. Dalmas did not receive the two points for his fifth place, as he was driving Larrousse&#x27;s second car and the team had officially entered only one car for the championship.

===Race classification===

* Dalmas did not receive points towards the Drivers&#x27; Championship or the Jim Clark Trophy, as he was driving Larrousse-Lola&#x27;s second car and the team had officially entered only one car for the entire championship.

<text>The 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 3 April 1988, at the renamed Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet in Rio de Janeiro. Following his 3rd World Drivers&#x27; Championship in the Jacarepaguá Circuit was named after local hero Nelson Piquet. It was the first race of the Formula One season.

==Background==
Winter testing had indicated Ferrari would be maintaining the edge that they had gained by winning the final two races of the season despite only having an updated version of their 1987 car, with McLaren-Honda and Williams, now with naturally aspirated Judd V8 engines, also producing cars that looked like potential race winners.

Ferrari had dominated the pre-season tests in Rio with times that were not only faster than everyone else, but faster than had been recorded at the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix, prompting rumors that the team had either shut off the FIA&#x27;s mandatory pop-off valve which in 1988 limited turbo boost pressure to just 2.5 Bar, or more likely were running the 1987 valve which had a 4.0 Bar limit (although neither Ferrari or Honda gave out official power figures for their engines, most of the team engineers agreed that in 1988 the turbo engines had lost approximately due to the reduction in boost). The rumors were renewed during qualifying in Brazil when neither Michele Alboreto nor Gerhard Berger could get near their test times from a month earlier and both drivers complained of engines that were down on power, too thirsty and had poor throttle response out of the slower corners. With the 1988 pop-off valve connected, both Ferraris were also significantly slower on the circuits long back straight than either the McLaren or Lotus Hondas which were all timed at over .

During the qualifying session, there was controversy when Nelson Piquet made comments in the local media publicly insulting Ayrton Senna, though he later claimed he did not know he was talking to a journalist and was forced to withdraw his allegation under threat of a lawsuit (over time, these insults by Piquet – with the aid of Prost – also extended to claims that Senna was homosexual, particularly given his failed marriage in 1982; as it transpired in a 1990 interview of Senna by Brazilian edition of Playboy the gay claim may have been motivated by the fact that Senna had apparently had a relationship with Piquet&#x27;s wife when she was single). The World Champion had also been insulting about Nigel Mansell&#x27;s wife Roseanne (calling her an &quot;unattractive boxhead&quot;), and both drivers&#x27; families.

BMS Dallara&#x27;s Alex Caffi had to use a modified Formula 3000 chassis because the Formula One chassis was not ready. As the F3000 chassis could not fit the newer 3.5L Cosworth DFZ engine, the car was forced to use an old Cosworth DFY making it the last time an engine derived from the 3.0L Cosworth DFV engine that had debuted in Formula One in , was used in a Formula One Grand Prix.

Drivers making their debut in Rio were: Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin (March-Judd), Spanish driver Luis Pérez-Sala (Minardi-Ford), Argentine Sportscar driver Oscar Larrauri (EuroBrun-Ford) making his F1 debut at the age of 33, Briton Julian Bailey (Tyrrell-Ford) who had sold just about everything he owned in order to pay for his drive with Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s team, and young German Formula 3 Champion Bernd Schneider signed with Zakspeed. Of the new drivers, only Bailey and Schneider failed to qualify.

BMS Dallara, EuroBrun (with Larrauri and 1987 International Formula 3000 champion Stefano Modena) and Rial Racing, with veteran Andrea de Cesaris as its sole driver, were making their F1 debuts as constructors. The EuroRacing side of the EuroBrun team had formerly run the factory backed Alfa Romeo team from 1982–85, while Brun Motorsport, run by Swiss slot machine magnate and race driver Walter Brun, were long time competitors in the World Sportscar Championship. Rial, run by German Günter Schmid, was basically a rebirth of his old ATS Team which had previously competed in Formula One from 1977–84. All three teams would use the ubiquitous 3.5L Ford DFZ V8 engine.

==Qualifying==
Just five months after his crash during qualifying for the 1987 Japanese Grand Prix, Mansell produced a sensational performance to qualify his naturally aspirated Williams second, 1.5 seconds faster than the next &#x27;atmo&#x27; car, the Benetton-Ford of Thierry Boutsen in 7th. On the pole was Senna in his first drive for McLaren with a time almost two seconds slower than Mansell&#x27;s 1987 pole time. The second row was occupied by Gerhard Berger&#x27;s Ferrari and Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren. After only a small amount of testing at Imola before joining in the Rio tests due to the late finish of the car, neither Senna or Prost were happy with the balance of their McLaren MP4/4s in qualifying.

Making Mansell&#x27;s lap even more impressive was that while the McLaren-Hondas either side of him were hitting over on the 900 metre long back straight, his Williams-Judd was only recorded at , slower even than the turbos were recording on the shorter pit straight. It showed just how much wing he was forced to run on his car despite the team continuing to use its computer run Reactive suspension system, though Mansell himself put it down to an underpowered Judd V8 on its race debut.

By qualifying on the front row, Mansell became the first driver of a naturally aspirated (atmo) car to start on the front row of a Grand Prix since his former Williams teammate Keke Rosberg had put his Williams-Ford on pole position for the 1983 Brazilian Grand Prix at the same circuit.

The four non-qualifiers were the Tyrrell-Ford of Julian Bailey, the turbo Zakspeeds of Piercarlo Ghinzani and Schneider, and the turbo Osella of Nicola Larini. Alex Caffi failed to pre-qualify his converted F3000 Dallara.

==Race summary==
On the parade lap, Senna&#x27;s gear selector mechanism broke and he had to complete the lap jammed in first gear. The first start was aborted and Senna started in the spare car from the pits. At the second start, Alain Prost with no one in front of him due to Senna&#x27;s absence, won the start and put in one of his famous first laps that saw him lead by almost 2 seconds, with Mansell in 2nd place, though he was soon passed by Berger&#x27;s Ferrari. After running in the hot air behind the turbocharged Ferrari, on lap 19 Mansell&#x27;s temperature gauge showed that the Williams was overheating (at the first aborted start Mansell had been forced to drive off around the track, thankfully without penalty, due to his Judd V8 already overheating on the grid). He entered the pits to investigate, handing third to Nelson Piquet in his Lotus; during the process, Mansell stalled his engine.

Senna was making a remarkable drive from the rear of the grid, climbing to 21st on lap 1 (after almost colliding with the March of his former flatmate Maurício Gugelmin who suffered gearbox failure less than 50 metres after the start of his debut race and pulled to the inside of the track as Senna was leaving the pits), 15th on lap 4, 8th on lap 10, into the points on lap 13 and by lap 20 was in second place after passing Piquet on the back straight following a pit stop to Berger.

In previous years with high horsepower, the Rio circuit had proved savage on tyres and drivers were forced to stop two or three times a race for new rubber. With the reduction of turbo boost in 1988, tyre wear was reduced and McLaren figured on only one stop for their drivers. Prost pitted on lap 26 without losing the lead, and Senna pitted a lap later. During his stop Senna stalled his Honda engine and dropped to sixth place. Shortly afterwards he was shown the black flag and disqualified for changing cars after the green flag had been shown following the parade lap, a move that was not allowed. Over the last 10 laps of the race Berger closed to within 10 seconds of leader Prost, but the Frenchman was merely pacing himself to make sure he finished on the now lower fuel limit and Berger was unable to catch him.

Piquet, the reigning World Champion, came home third in his first drive for Lotus ahead of Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron. Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari and Satoru Nakajima in the second Lotus rounded out the points with 5th and 6th places. The first atmospheric car to finish was the Benetton-Ford of Thierry Boutsen. Nakajima and Boutsen both finished a lap down on Prost in 7th place. The first race of FISA&#x27;s new equivalency formula in a bid to make the &#x27;atmos&#x27; competitive had seen turbos still take all the points on offer.

<doc id="1123000" wikidata="Q515908" url="?curid=1123000" title="1988 San Marino Grand Prix">
<text>The 1988 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 1 May 1988. The 60-lap race was the second round of the 1988 Formula One season. Ayrton Senna scored his first victory for the McLaren team, with turbocharged Honda-powered cars sweeping the top three positions.

==Qualifying==
The McLaren-Hondas totally dominated qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix. Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost occupied the front row of the grid with times of 1:27.148 and 1:27.919 respectively. Their nearest challenger was the Lotus of reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet with a time of 1:30.500. All the more interesting was that Piquet&#x27;s Lotus was powered by the same specification turbocharged Honda engine that powered the McLarens and he was as fast as them through the speed trap on the run to Tosa, yet he was over 3 seconds slower than Senna. The difference was that the lowline McLaren MP4/4&#x27;s were untouchable under acceleration and they had superior grip to any other car on the grid.

Amazingly, considering the team&#x27;s success in its Formula One history dating back to , this was only the third time that there was an all-McLaren front row for a Grand Prix. The other two times had been at the 1972 Canadian Grand Prix (Peter Revson and Denny Hulme) and the 1986 German Grand Prix (Keke Rosberg and Alain Prost).

Not including the last two races of 1987 that he missed through injury, Nigel Mansell missed qualifying on the front row of the grid for the first time since the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix. He qualified his Williams-Judd in 11th place, five places behind teammate Riccardo Patrese in 6th. The fastest atmo car in qualifying was the Benetton-Ford of Alessandro Nannini who ended up 4th on the grid in front of the disappointing Ferrari of Gerhard Berger who, along with teammate Michele Alboreto (who qualified 10th, almost 4.5 seconds slower than Senna), found the turbocharged Italian V6 engines down on power throughout.

The claims of Berger and Alboreto were backed up by the speed trap figures. The fastest car on the long run to Tosa was the Lotus-Honda of Piquet timed at just over (1.5 km/h faster than the McLarens). The Ferraris were much slower at , and were some slower than the McLarens over the start-finish line (McLaren were fastest there at almost . In fact, both Ferraris were almost slower over the start line than the atmospheric Benettons (who were also the fastest of the atmos at Tosa with ) and were also slower at the start/finish line than the Zakspeeds, showing just how much trouble they were in.

One of the surprises of qualifying was American veteran Eddie Cheever. Not noted as the best qualifier, Cheever qualified 8th in his Arrows-Megatron, though he was still 4.1 seconds behind Senna. Cheever and Arrows had tested at Imola a week before the race and came up with a set-up they liked. The same settings were put on Derek Warwick&#x27;s Arrows but the Briton admitted he found the settings lazy and could only qualify 14th, 1.2 seconds slower than his teammate. The turbocharged Arrows&#x27;, with Cheever and Warwick still hampered by the pop-off valve cutting in early, were touching just under on the run to Tosa to make them the fastest behind the Honda powered cars.

The EuroBrun-Ford Cosworth of Oscar Larrauri, the Ligier-Judds of Stefan Johansson and former Imola pole winner René Arnoux, and the Zakspeed turbo of Bernd Schneider all failed to qualify, while the Osella of Italian Nicola Larini was excluded after scrutineering when it was discovered that the car&#x27;s engine mounting points had been illegally changed. The scrutineers ruled that this constituted an entirely new chassis for the Osella FA1L and as the new chassis had not yet been crash approved by FISA, the team was excluded from the meeting. For Ligier it was the first time since the team&#x27;s début in Formula One in that neither car had qualified for a race. For Arnoux it was a bitter pill to swallow as he had sat on the pole at the circuit three times previously when he had driven for both Renault (1980 and 1982) and Ferrari (1983). Johansson, driving for Ferrari (1985 and 1986) and McLaren the previous year, had finished each race in the points.

After qualifying, Lotus team boss Peter Warr and lead driver Nelson Piquet made the claim that despite the three second gap between the McLarens and the rest of the field, they believed the Lotus and even the Ferraris were better aerodynamically than the McLarens and that would hurt their fuel consumption on what was one of the most fuel thirsty circuits on the calendar. Warr predicted the McLarens would not be able to maintain their advantage and still finish the race on their 150-litre fuel limit. Not for the first time, or the last, his public predictions would prove to be wrong.

==Race summary==
The McLaren of Ayrton Senna led from the start, whilst his teammate Alain Prost had his engine stall coming to take his place on the grid (Prost later reported that the engine had also stalled earlier on the parade lap). The car was still rolling so he bump started it but it &quot;almost&quot; stalled again as the race started and he dropped to 7th place behind the Arrows of Eddie Cheever. Whilst he was able to recover these places and get back to second place by lap 8, he could not catch Senna who controlled the gap according to the traffic. Maintaining a lead of 6–10 seconds, Senna slowed on the last lap to make sure he finished without running out of fuel which reduced the gap to the pursuing Prost to just 2.3 seconds at the line. Prost later admitted he had turned up his turbo boost in his fight up to second and although still lapping quicker than most of the field, he was then forced to conserve for the rest of the race for fear of running dry before the end.

Nelson Piquet battled with an ill-handling Lotus but used superior Honda power to maintain 3rd place ahead of a train of cars including both Benettons, both Williams and Berger&#x27;s Ferrari. He was lucky to make it to the finish line as the extra boost needed to keep his position cut severely into his fuel. Had he not been lapped only four laps from the finish (meaning he only had to complete three of the remaining laps), he might not have had enough fuel to complete his last lap.

Nigel Mansell made a superb drive from a poor 11th place on the grid to be briefly up to 3rd place after taking Piquet under braking for the Rivazza on lap 40. However, as soon as Mansell got past the Lotus, blue oil smoke started to appear from the back of his Williams and less than a lap later Piquet again used his Honda&#x27;s superior power to slipstream Mansell through the Tamburello and re-take 3rd through Villeneuve. However fleeting the move was, Mansell would retire just a lap after dropping to 4th with a faulty voltage regulator.

Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Benetton came home in 4th ahead of Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari, though late in the race he was hampered by a down on power engine thanks to a cracked exhaust on his car, and rounding out the points was his teammate Alessandro Nannini. Nannini had been fighting for 3rd place with Piquet, but despite being consistently quicker in the corners, he had to yield to superior Honda power on the straights. Piquet and Nannini banged wheels at the Tosa hairpin, and a couple of laps later the Italian lost 4th place to his teammate after another wheel banging dual with the reigning World Champion caused him to spin at Tosa. Nannini dropped to 7th with Boutsen, delayed 2 seconds by Nannini&#x27;s spin, now charging after Piquet. A fired up Nannini then put in the fastest atmospheric lap in a climb back into the points and 5th place. Nannini had to settle for 6th though after being passed on the last lap at the Acqua Minerale chicane by a grass-cutting Gerhard Berger, now charging thanks to being lapped and having to drive one less lap on fuel. Some were surprised that Berger wasn&#x27;t penalised for the move and while Ferrari team boss Marco Piccinini claimed it was necessary for Berger to avoid a crash with Nannini, television replays suggested otherwise.

Both Senna and Prost recorded a fastest race lap faster than Nelson Piquet&#x27;s qualifying time and both McLaren drivers had lapped the entire field up to and including Piquet in 3rd place by lap 56 of the 60 lap race. That was actually good news for Piquet and Berger in their turbo powered cars against the atmospheric Benettons as it meant they had to do one less race lap on their allowed fuel and could push harder for the final three laps of the race. Prost&#x27;s second place earned him 6 points which saw him surpass his and McLaren teammate Niki Lauda as the all-time career points leader, with 421.5 to Lauda&#x27;s 420.5 points.

In what had become standard practice at McLaren since Prost&#x27;s disqualification for being 2 kg underweight at the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix, both McLarens stopped within metres of taking the chequered flag. Prost had started the last lap some 7 seconds behind his teammate but was only 2.334 behind at the flag as Senna had driven only as fast as he needed to both win and conserve fuel at what was traditionally one of the most fuel thirsty circuits on the Formula One calendar.

Surprisingly given that in previous years numerous drivers of turbo powered cars had failed to finish a race at San Marino due to running out of fuel and that the 1988 fuel limit of 150 litres was 45 less than in 1986-1987, and 70 less than the 1984-1985 limit, no turbo runner ran out of fuel at Imola in 1988. The only turbo starter to not finish was the Ferrari of local hero Michele Alboreto, who was classified as 18th and last despite suffering engine failure on lap 54. This was his second engine failure of the day after his Ferrari also blew up in the morning warm-up session forcing him into the spare car for the race. He was also forced to start from the rear of the field after stalling his engine as the field went away on the warm-up lap.

<text>The 1988 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the 46e Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held on 15 May 1988 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo. It was the third race of the 1988 Formula One World Championship.

The 78-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-Honda. Prost took his fourth and final Monaco win after Brazilian teammate Ayrton Senna crashed out late on while leading comfortably. Austrian driver Gerhard Berger finished second in a Ferrari, with Italian teammate Michele Alboreto third.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
The McLaren-Hondas continued their dominant form from the previous race at Imola, as Ayrton Senna took pole position by an almost unbelievable 1.4 seconds ahead of teammate Alain Prost, with a further 1.2 seconds back to the Ferrari of Gerhard Berger in third. Berger&#x27;s teammate Michele Alboreto was fourth, while Nigel Mansell was fifth in the Williams, the quickest of the naturally-aspirated cars, albeit some 3.6 seconds behind Senna. Completing the top ten were Alessandro Nannini in the Benetton, Derek Warwick in the Arrows, Riccardo Patrese in the second Williams, Eddie Cheever in the second Arrows and Jonathan Palmer in the Tyrrell, while among the non-qualifiers was Satoru Nakajima, whose Lotus was powered by the same Honda turbo engine as the McLaren.

==Race==
===Race report===
At the start, Senna led away, while Berger overtook Prost when the Frenchman momentarily could not engage second gear. Behind them, a variety of accidents occurred at Sainte-Dévote: Alex Caffi hit the wall in his Dallara; Philippe Streiff, who had started 12th in his AGS, retired when an accelerator cable broke; and World Champion Nelson Piquet collided with Cheever, which forced the Brazilian to retire at the end of the first lap and thus end a disastrous weekend for the Lotus team.

The running order of Senna, Berger, Prost, Mansell, Alboreto and Nannini was maintained until lap 33 when Alboreto took Mansell off at the Swimming Pool, ending the Englishman&#x27;s race. Nannini then suffered a gearbox failure on lap 39. On lap 51, Patrese collided with Philippe Alliot&#x27;s Lola while trying to lap him; Alliot retired immediately.

On lap 54, Prost passed Berger for second on the run to Sainte-Dévote, though he was some 50 seconds behind Senna. In an effort to put some pressure on his team-mate, he started trading fastest laps with him. With 11 laps remaining, McLaren team boss Ron Dennis radioed Senna to slow down to ensure a safe 1-2 finish, allowing Prost to gain six seconds.

On lap 67, Senna lost concentration at Portier, causing him to spin his McLaren into the barrier and damage the car&#x27;s front suspension. Immediately afterwards, he went to his home in Monaco to contemplate losing a race that he had dominated from the first time he took to the track for free practice on Thursday morning; the McLaren team did not even hear from him until that evening, when he walked into the pits as they were packing up.

Prost thus took his fourth Monaco win in five years, with Berger some 20 seconds behind and Alboreto a further 21 seconds back. Warwick finished fourth after a race-long battle with Palmer, while Patrese recovered from his collision with Alliot to take the final point, passing the other Lola of Yannick Dalmas on the last lap. Patrese&#x27;s point was also the first-ever World Championship point scored by a Judd-powered car and his first point for Williams.

<text>The 1988 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 29 May 1988 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexico City. It was the fourth race of the 1988 Formula One World Championship. The 67-lap race was won by Alain Prost, driving a McLaren-Honda, with teammate Ayrton Senna second and Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
Qualifying for the Mexican Grand Prix saw few surprises. The turbo powered cars were expected to dominate in the high () altitude of Mexico City where the naturally aspirated cars would lose approximately 20-25% of their power in the thinner air. The turbo cars also lost some of their own power in the thinner air, but it was estimated to only be around 5%, still giving them a big advantage over the atmos.

The McLaren-Hondas dominated the qualifying session once again. Ayrton Senna took his 20th career pole and his 4th pole from 4 races in 1988 with a lap time that was almost a second faster than Nigel Mansell&#x27;s 1987 time despite the restriction in turbo boost from 4.0 Bar to 2.5 bar for 1988 (a drop of approximately ). It was the first time in 1988 that a 1987 pole time had been beaten. Alain Prost was predictably second on the grid, though he was some 6/10ths slower than his teammate. Gerhard Berger (Ferrari) and Nelson Piquet (Lotus-Honda) made up the 2nd row. Satoru Nakajima (Lotus-Honda) and Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron) made good use of the turbos&#x27; altitude advantage to qualify 6th and 7th respectively behind the 5th placed Ferrari of Michele Alboreto. For Nakajima it was something of a redemption as he had failed to qualify at Monaco. Mansell in the Williams-Judd could only make 14th due to continuing problems with the FW12&#x27;s computer controlled Reactive Ride (suspension) with both Mansell and Patrese reporting that their cars handling would not only change from lap to lap, but sometimes even from one corner to the next.

Alessandro Nannini&#x27;s Benetton-Ford was the fastest &#x27;atmo&#x27; car, some 3.3 seconds slower than Senna&#x27;s pole time, while the Tyrrells of Jonathan Palmer and Julian Bailey, the turbo Osella of Nicola Larini and the Minardi of Adrián Campos failed to qualify. German Bernd Schneider qualified in 15th place for his first Grand Prix start in the Zakspeed turbo. Larini&#x27;s failure to qualify in the Osella turbo, reportedly the most powerful used in Grand Prix racing in 1988, highlighted the problems the Osella team had with both the ancient Alfa Romeo 890T engine (badged as &quot;Osella V8&quot; for the year after Alfa&#x27;s parent company Fiat pulled their support) and their car, the FA1L, in 1988 which was appropriately nicknamed &quot;FAIL&quot;.

The last qualifying session was dominated by Philippe Alliot&#x27;s terrifying crash after he lost control of his Lola, coming out of the Peraltada curve that leads onto the pit straight. The Peraltada, being slightly banked, was being taken at speeds in excess of in qualifying. After riding the outside curbing, the car suddenly pulled hard right, cut across the track and collided with the pit wall, barrel-rolling down the straight and back across the track, immediately disintegrating, and in the end stopped upside down on the edge of the track. Remarkably, Alliot was not only unhurt, but the Larrousse team was able to rebuild the Lola LC88 overnight (the re-build was necessary as the team was still awaiting a replacement chassis after Alliot had also crashed in the previous race in Monaco). After being given a clean bill of health from chief F1 medico Professor Sid Watkins, Alliot was able to take his place on the starting grid.

===Race===
The first start was aborted because of Alessandro Nannini, who stalled the engine of his Benetton on the grid. As is normal practice since it meant an extra formation lap and as re-fueling on the grid was not allowed, this saw the race reduced from 68 to 67 laps. On the second start, Prost made a lightning getaway and took the lead. Senna was slightly slowed by the pop-off valve opening too soon and was passed by Nelson Piquet who had actually made the best start; so good that he was almost able to out brake Prost into the first turn but the Frenchman held his line. This allowed Prost to take advantage and build a lead of almost two seconds by the end of the first lap. Senna passed Piquet for second, coming into the Peraltada curve on the first lap, but from there could only ever bridge the ever-growing gap to Prost when lapping traffic. While the McLarens held the first two places throughout the race, Berger had passed Piquet for 3rd place under braking at the end of the main straight on lap 9, and by half distance he had moved to within three seconds of Senna when he backed off after receiving a &#x27;low fuel&#x27; warning from his onboard computer (which turned out to be incorrect). Nakajima was also slightly slowed by the pop-off valve opening too soon on his Honda engine and was passed by Michele Alboreto on lap 8. On lap 28 Nakajima retired with piston failure in his Honda engine, followed on lap 59 by teammate Piquet with a similar engine failure.

As predicted, the turbo cars dominated the race. The two Ferraris finished 3rd and 4th (Alboreto in 4th being the last car to be lapped by the McLarens) ahead of the two Arrows of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever who had a race-long duel and were separated by just 0.7s at the line with Cheever describing their dice as &quot;good fun&quot;. The first &#x27;atmo&#x27; cars home were the two Benettons who finished two laps down (even lapped by the two Arrows cars directly ahead of them) and out of the points in 7th and 8th after another race long duel with Nannini coming out on top, battling not only his teammate but a pinched nerve in his right foot from never having had to drive as hard for as long. Yannick Dalmas (Lola-Ford) fought his way from 22nd up to 9th at the flag and after starting 15th, while F1 rookie Bernd Schneider gained some praise after running as high as 11th in the much maligned Zakspeed in the early laps before retiring with a blown engine on lap 17.

Alain Prost set a new lap record on lap 52 of the 67-lap race with a time of 1:18.608, half a second faster than Nelson Piquet&#x27;s 1987 lap record when the turbo engines had approximately 300 more horsepower. This, along with Senna&#x27;s faster than 1987 pole time, showed the advancements in engines, tyres, aerodynamics and chassis development in the seven months between the 1987 and 1988 races.
