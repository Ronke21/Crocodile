<text>Thomas Russell Crampton, MICE, MIMechE (6 August 1816 – 19 April 1888) was an English engineer born at Broadstairs, Kent, and trained on Brunel&#x27;s Great Western Railway.

He is best known for designing the Crampton locomotive but had many engineering interests including the electric telegraph and the Channel Tunnel for which he designed a boring machine. His locomotives had much better success in France, Germany and Italy than they did in the UK.

==Personal life==
Born to John and Mary Crampton of Prospect Cottage (in what is now Dickens Walk), Broadstairs, on 6 August 1816, Crampton was the son of a plumber and architect. He was educated privately. Crampton married Louisa Martha Hall, who was a singer and a friend of Jenny Lind, on 25 February 1841. They had 8 children, six boys and two girls. The eldest girl, Ada Sarah, died aged 4 on 16 February 1857. and Crampton gifted a stained glass window in St. Peter&#x27;s church, Broadstairs in her memory. Their youngest daughter, Louisa, was to marry Sir Horace Rumbold, the Ambassador to the Netherlands.

He died at his home, 19 Ashley Place, Westminster on 19 April 1888 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Career==
Crampton entered a career in engineering, initially with Marc Brunel and later with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in Swindon.

===Great Western Railway 1839-43===
Crampton worked as assistant to Marc Brunel and on joining the GWR in 1839, then Daniel Gooch. Crampton was involved in the design of the &quot;Firefly&quot; class of locomotives. Gooch&#x27;s aim was to produce broad gauge locomotives that were better than those on the standard gauge lines, thus proving the broad gauge system was the better technically. Crampton, unbeknown to the GWR, had the idea of improving standard gauge locomotives so that they could match those of the broad gauge. In 1843, he left the GWR.

===Development 1844-51===
Crampton realised that the locomotives of the GWR were better than the standard gauge locomotives for a number of reasons. The broad gauge allowed a larger boiler diameter and higher centre of gravity for the same stability. Broad gauge also allowed a bigger firebox and heating area. Larger driving wheels gave a lower piston speed, which allowed a higher speed for the locomotive before exhaust problems occurred.

In 1843, Crampton took out a patent for a new design of locomotive. It is for the physical appearance of his locomotives that Crampton is remembered for today, with the driving wheel placed behind the firebox. But there were technical improvements that he made, which laid the foundations for future locomotive design. The three most important improvements were:- wide steam passages, large heating surfaces and generous bearing surfaces on the wheels.

From 1844 to 1848, Crampton was working for John and George Rennie.

In 1845, Crampton received his first order for a locomotive built to his patent. 
The Namur and Liège Railway in Belgium ordered three locomotives with diameter driving wheels and a grate. They were built by the firm of Tulk and Ley of Whitehaven. One of the locomotives was tested in 1847 on the London and North Western Railway, who then built a &quot;Crampton Patent&quot; locomotive at Crewe. Another two locomotives were bought by the LNWR, including a 6-2-0 &quot;Liverpool&quot; built by Bury, Curtis and Kennedy in 1848 with diameter driving wheels. A claim of being achieved was made, with an average of over with a 60-ton load. Another claim was for a speed of hauling eight carriages over at an average speed of .

One locomotive Crampton designed had an indirect drive arrangement, with a crankshaft between the driving wheels. This locomotive had a 2-2+2-2 wheel arrangement. In 1847, Crampton became a founder member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and in 1848, Crampton set up in business as a Civil Engineer in London. In 1850, a Crampton locomotive was exhibited at Birmingham which had balance weights on the driving wheels. This feature was commented upon by William Stroudley. In 1851, Crampton started the Broadstairs Gasworks, overseeing the construction and financing much of the works.

===South Eastern Railway 1851-88===

By 1851, Crampton was working for the South Eastern Railway (SER). In that year, ten new Crampton locomotives were built, and one of these, No.136 &quot;Folkstone&quot; was exhibited at The Great Exhibition. In 1854, Crampton became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and in 1855 he was responsible for the building of the Berlin waterworks. In 1856, Crampton was appointed to the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. In 1859, Crampton formed the Broadstairs Water Company, building a water tower high which now forms the Crampton Tower Museum. The water tower could hold of water. Broadstairs Water Company was taken over by Broadstairs Urban District Council in 1901. In 1860, Crampton designed a tower for Holy Trinity church, Broadstairs, which Dickens had described as a &quot;hideous temple of flint, a petrified haystack&quot;. Crampton donated a clock as a personal gift to the church. he also donated a wrought iron bridge which was built across Goodson Steps. This is the Louisa Gap bridge, named after his youngest daughter. Crampton was elected vice-president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1883.

===Peto, Betts and Crampton===
Crampton entered a partnership with Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts to undertake part of the construction of the London Chatham and Dover Railway. When the partnership became insolvent in 1867, Crampton was made personally bankrupt, but, unlike Peto and Betts, managed to retain his good reputation and continue in business.

===Railway lines constructed===
Crampton was, wholly or partly, responsible for the railway lines built between Smyrna and Aidin; Varna and Rustchuk; Strood and Dover; Sevenoaks and Swanley; and Herne Bay and Faversham. The latter three lines being built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). Crampton was also the contractor, and later chairman of the East and West Junction Railway. A Crampton locomotive was used to haul the first train from Kineton to Fenny Compton. Crampton was a partner in the Mont Cenis Pass Railway

===Electric telegraph===
Crampton was responsible for the laying of the first international submarine cable in the world. This was laid in the Strait of Dover in 1851. The first messages were carried on 13 November 1851 and the cable was in use until 1859.

The company behind the project was an Anglo-French undertaking, known as &quot;la Compagnie du télégraphe sous-marin&quot; in France and the &quot;Submarine Telegraph Company between France and England&quot; in Great Britain. Crampton was the engineer, and Charlton Wollaston was the electrician involved in laying the cable across the Channel. The SER were another early user of the electric telegraph, and it was by use of the SER&#x27;s wires that messages were able to be transmitted between Paris and London, being relayed from Dover.

===Channel Tunnel===
Crampton designed an automatic hydraulic tunnel boring machine, which was intended to be used in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. Modern drilling techniques were made possible by this invention.

==Family==
Crampton&#x27;s first wife died on 16 March 1875 and he married Elizabeth Werge on 25 August 1881. 
He left six sons and one daughter, who married Sir Horace Rumbold, ambassador at Vienna.

<doc id="1121700" wikidata="Q1323719" url="?curid=1121700" title="United Progressive Alliance">
<text>The United Progressive Alliance (UPA; IAST: Saṁyukta Pragatiśīl Gaṭhabandhan) was a political alliance in India led by the Indian National Congress. It was formed after the 2004 general election with support from left-leaning political parties when no single party got the majority.

The UPA subsequently governed India from 2004 until 2014 for two terms before losing power to their main rivals, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The UPA used to rule seven States and union territories of India before it was dissolved to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance on 18 July 2023 ahead of the 2024 general election.

==History==
=== 2004–2008 ===
UPA was formed soon after the 2004 Indian general election when no party had won a majority. The then ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 181 seats of 544, as opposed to the UPA&#x27;s tally of 218 seats.

The Left Front with 59 MPs (excluding the speaker of the Lok Sabha), the Samajwadi Party with 39 MPs and the Bahujan Samaj Party with 19 MPs were other significant blocks that supported UPA at various times. UPA did not achieve a majority, rather it relied on external support, similar to the formula adopted by the previous minority governments of the United Front, the NDA, the Congress government of P. V. Narasimha Rao, and earlier governments of V. P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.

An informal alliance had existed prior to the elections as several of the constituent parties had developed seat-sharing agreements in many states. After the election the results of negotiations between parties were announced. The UPA government&#x27;s policies were initially guided by a common minimum programme that the alliance hammered out with consultations with Jyoti Basu and Harkishan Singh Surjeet of the 59-member Left Front. Hence, government policies were generally perceived as centre-left, reflecting the centrist policies of the INC.

During the tenure of Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda, the constituents of the UPA were, by mutual consent, supporting his government.

On 22 July 2008, the UPA survived a vote of confidence in the parliament brought on by the Left Front withdrawing their support in protest at the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement. The Congress party and its leaders along with then Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh were accused of a &quot;cash for vote&quot; scam as part of the cash-for-votes scandal, in which they were accused of buying votes in Lok Sabha to save the government. During UPA I, the economy saw steady economic growth and many people (100 million+) escaped poverty.

=== 2009–2014 ===
In the 2009 Lok Sabha election, the UPA won 262 seats, of which the INC accounted for 206. During UPA II, the alliance won election in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh. However, there were several allegations of scams during its tenure that impacted UPA&#x27;s image nationwide and the approval rating for the government fell. In addition, many members left for YSRCP. This started a domino effect with members leaving to form their own parties and parties such as DMK leaving the alliance altogether. During this time UPA struggled with state election and leadership stability. The alliance suffered a defeat in 2014 Indian general election as it won only 60 seats. In addition, UPA won only one state election and got wiped out from Andhra Pradesh where they previously had 150+ MLAs.

=== 2015–2019 ===
From 2014 to 2017, UPA won only 3 state elections. This was blamed on the alliance&#x27;s failed leadership and weakness compared to the NDA. In addition the party lost power in states where they had once won state elections as in Bihar. In 2017 the alliance lost again. In 2018 UPA had a phenomenal comeback in the state elections as the party won important in Karnataka, Rajasthan and others. More parties joined the alliance and it was stronger than ever.

In 2019 Indian general election the UPA won only 91 seats in the general election and INC won 52 seats, thus failed to secure 10% seats required for the leader of opposition post. The alliance lost another state to BJP with the party winning by-polls and pushing the UPA into the minority.

Towards the end of 2019, the alliance made huge gains in Haryana, won in Jharkhand and formed a state-level alliance called Maha Vikas Aghadi to form the government in Maharashtra with Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena leading the ministry. Shiv Sena had been a member of NDA for twenty five years. It left NDA and joined MVA in 2019.

=== 2020–2023 ===
Since 2020, more parties joined the alliance. The alliance lost the Bihar election that everyone expected it to win but in 2022, ruling party JD(U) left National Democratic Alliance and rejoined Mahagathbandhan to form government in Bihar.

In addition UPA only won 1 out of the 5 state elections in 2021. However the alliance made significant gain in a number of MLA races. MVA lost control of Maharashtra due to crisis and split in Shiv Sena. Moreover, UPA lost in Gujarat assembly elections however, it won the state election in Himachal Pradesh.

In 2023, UPA again failed in winning elections in the North-East but won the assembly in the very important state of Karnataka.

The alliance was rebranded as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance on 18 July 2023, with many parties joining the newly-formed alliance. The alliance will contest the 2024 Indian general election, being the primary opposition to the ruling National Democratic Alliance.

==Controversies==
The winter session of parliament in October 2008 came under intense criticism from the Left parties and the BJP to demand a full-fledged winter session instead of what was seen as the UPA to having &quot;scuttled the voice of Parliament&quot; by bringing down the sittings to a record low of 30 days in the year. The tensions between the UPA and the opposition parties became evident at an all-party meeting convened by Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee when the leader of opposition, L. K. Advani questioned the status, timing and schedule of the current session of parliament.

M. Karunanidhi had said he felt &quot;let down&quot; by the &quot;lukewarm&quot; response of the centre and had demanded amendments in the resolution on Sri Lanka.

One of the amendments was to &quot;declare that genocide and war crimes had been committed and inflicted on the Sri Lankan Tamils by the Sri Lanka Army and the administrators&quot;.

The second one was &quot;establishment of a credible and independent international commission of investigation in a time-bound manner into the allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, violations of international International human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law and crime of genocide against the Tamils&quot;. Karunanidhi said Parliament should adopt the resolution incorporating these two amendments.

The years 2006 to 2008 and 2010 to 2013 were a darkest part of the UPA, due to the failure to prevent several terrorist attacks nationwide. The UPA had repealed the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 in 2004, which softened the stand on acts of terrorism and reduced powers for the law enforcement while dealing with acts of terrorism. The weakened legislation, along with intelligence failures, compromised law enforcement, and political interference, resulted in bombings in 2008 across cities like Jaipur, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi, led by the Indian Mujahideen under support from Pakistan-based ISI, as well as 2006 Mumbai train bombings and 2006 Varanasi bombings. During the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, when 10 Pakistani terrorists from the banned terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba under the support from Pakistan Army and ISI, came from the sea route and seized the city from 26 to 29 November 2008, the UPA Government faced immense criticism from citizens and leaders of opposition for intelligence failures as well as not being able to provide quick transportation for NSG commandos, who neutralized 8 of the 10 terrorists at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, the Oberoi Trident hotel, and the Chabad House. Furthermore, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, faced denunciation for launching a book which mentioned that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was somehow linked to the attack, despite credible evidence and confessions from Ajmal Kasab, the only gunman who was captured by Mumbai Police; Singh was also publicly criticized for coining the terms Hindu Terror and Saffron Terror. The 2008 attacks in Mumbai subsequently led to resignation of several leaders like Vilasrao Deshmukh, R. R. Patil and Shivraj Patil, on the grounds of moral responsibility as well as for making insensitive statements in the aftermath. The UPA subsequently faced widespread reprobation for being soft against Pakistan following the attack by avoiding military action against terrorist hideouts, as well as in the aftermath of Pakistan Army beheading soldiers of the Indian Army in 2013, along with staying silent after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif labeled Manmohan Singh &quot;Dehati Aurat&quot; (meaning village woman).

Following the 2011 Mumbai bombings, which claimed 26 lives and injured 130+, UPA leader and INC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi remarked that it was impossible to stop every terror attack, adding that &quot;We work towards defeating it, but it is very difficult to stop all the attacks. Even the United States, they are being attacked in Afghanistan.&quot;. His comments were slammed from some quarters of the Indian political spectrum, who criticised him for equating the Mumbai attacks with those in Afghanistan and called it an insult to those killed in the blasts. The ineptness towards national security, the insensitive statements made by Congress leadership following the terror attack, and the inaction against Pakistan sponsored terrorist groups was one of the few factors that led to the UPA suffering a major defeat in the 2014 General elections.

The UPA was criticised for its alleged involvement scams such as the Commonwealth Games Scam of 2010, the 2G spectrum case, and the Indian coal allocation scam. Apart from the above-mentioned scams, the UPA has been under intense fire for the alleged doles handed out to the son-in-law of the Gandhi family, Robert Vadra, by UPA-run state governments. The UPA was also rebuked for shielding and not prosecuting RJD leader and Railway Minister during UPA 1 Lalu Prasad Yadav, for his involvement in several corruption cases, including the fodder scam case as well as creating Jungle Raj in Bihar between 1990 and 2005, which affected economic and social standing of the state. Additionally, the UPA faced serious criticism on mishandling the national carrier Air India, which led to its financial crisis in 2006–07, before being sold to the Tata group in 2022.

The UPA Government has been severely condemned for mishandling the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. As per several media houses, the Government had failed to act positively or give credible assurances to the protesters and instead used police force and lathi-charging against protesters, while pushing the media out of the scene, and shutting down metro rail stations. In the aftermath of the incident, while the Government passed an amendment of the laws against rape and sexual assault, which ensured stricter punishments for rape convicts, the amendment was criticized and labeled as an eyewash, as the changes in the laws failed to serve as a deterrent to rising incidents of rape. Furthermore, several key suggestions were ignored, including the criminalisation of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law, which was severely condemned by several women&#x27;s safety activists. The UPA was also slammed for inaction against political leaders such as Digvijaya Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav for their comments which promoted misogyny and anti-women views, as well as insensitivity towards rape victims; Yadav was previously condemned for opposing the Women&#x27;s Reservation Bill in March 2010 and warning to withdraw from the alliance, making a sexist comment that &quot;if the bill is passed it will fill Parliament with the kind of women who invite catcalls and whistles&quot;.

During its tenure between 2004 and 2014, as well as before, the UPA faced widespread condemnation for indulging in appeasement politics for vote-bank of the Muslim community across India. Following the introduction of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalized triple talaq or instant divorce and replaced the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986, several leaders from the UPA opposed the law. In addition, the UPA faced immense criticism for the formation of the WAQF Board to appease the Muslim community, which has been responsible for land grabbing and forcible acquisition of properties nationwide, while evicting the original owners who possessed legal documents of ownership.

The UPA, in its opposition, faced immense criticism by the NDA Government for banking frauds, mostly by giving unsecured loans to fugitive businessmen Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi during the tenure of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Mallya owes money to a consortium of 17 banks, from whom he took loan to fund his now closed Kingfisher Airlines, and Modi owes money to the Punjab National Bank. While Mallya and Modi have been apprehended in the Great Britain and awaiting extradition, Choksi acquired citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, with a warrant against him to extradite to India for the bank fraud.

<doc id="1121701" wikidata="Q1971094" url="?curid=1121701" title="USS Oklahoma City (SSN-723)">
<text>USS &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; (SSN-723), a , is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 13 August 1981 and the keel was laid down on 4 January 1984. She was launched on 2 November 1985 sponsored by Mrs. Linda M. Nickles, and commissioned on 9 July 1988. In 1991, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

On 13 November 2002, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; collided with the Leif Hoegh liquefied natural gas tanker &quot;Norman Lady&quot;, east of the Strait of Gibraltar. No one on either vessel was hurt, and there were no leaks of oil from fuel tanks and no threat to the environment, but the submarine sustained damage to the periscope and sail area, and put into La Maddalena, Sardinia, for repairs. The submarine&#x27;s commanding officer was relieved of command on 30 November. One other officer and two enlisted crew members also were disciplined for dereliction of duty.

On 20 January 2005 &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia, after a six-month deployment in support of national security interests and the War on Terrorism. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; transited to a patrol area in the Pacific Ocean via the Arctic Ocean, the first such transit for a second-flight . After the patrol, she then completed a circumnavigation of North America by transiting back to the Atlantic Ocean through the Panama Canal and returning to her home port in Norfolk.

In early 2007, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; became the first submarine certified to exclusively use Digital Nautical Charts (DNCs), using the Voyage Management System (VMS). VMS is part of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System-Navy (ECDIS-N) system, which has been under development since 1990. The shift from traditional paper navigation to an all-electronic navigation suite marked the first significant shift in U.S. Navy navigation practices since the introduction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1990s.

From May to November 2007, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; completed a deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of the War on Terror. The submarine spent May to July 2008 in the Eastern Pacific in support of the War on Drugs, and was responsible for seizing more than 11 metric tons of cocaine valued at more than $1.5 billion (USD).

&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was awarded the 2008 Squadron Eight Battle &quot;E&quot;. After a 26-month overhaul, in March 2011 the sub was forward deployed to Guam.

&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, on 22 November 2021 to start her months-long inactivation and decommissioning process. The submarine was officially placed in reserve status, inactivated but in commission on 10 February 2022 and decommissioned on 9 September 2022.

<text>USS &quot;Chicago&quot; (SSN-721) is a , the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city of Chicago, Illinois. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 13 August 1981 and her keel was laid down on 5 January 1983. She was launched on 13 October 1984 sponsored by Mrs. Vicki Ann Paisley, wife of Melvyn R. Paisley assistant Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 27 September 1986. The &quot;Chicago&quot; was retired in 2023.

==History==
Early in 1996, an RQ-1 Predator aerial reconnaissance drone was successfully controlled from &quot;Chicago&quot;. The drone reached altitudes up to 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) and ranged up to 185 kilometers (100 nmi.) from the submarine, which was operating at periscope depth.

In the summer of 2005, &quot;Chicago&quot; tested the virtual periscope, a system that would allow submerged submarines to observe the surface above them without having to come to a shallower depth, as is required by traditional periscopes.

After completing a two-year maintenance and upgrade period at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in October 2011, &quot;Chicago&quot; arrived in April 2012 at her new homeport, assigned to Submarine Squadron 15, based at Joint Region Marianas on the island of Guam.

In keeping with a tradition that dates back to World War II, Richard O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s cribbage board was transferred from &#x27;s Wardroom to &quot;Chicago&quot;″s when &quot;Olympia&quot; was decommissioned on 31 October 2019, making &quot;Chicago&quot; the oldest fast attack boat in the Pacific Fleet.

On 2 November 2022, &quot;Chicago&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor following a seven-month final deployment.

&quot;Chicago&quot; arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 17 January 2023 for her months-long inactivation and decommissioning process. She was decommissioned on 21 July 2023 during a ceremony at Keyport, Washington.

==Awards==
&quot;Chicago&quot; has earned multiple awards in her service life. &quot;Chicago&quot; has been awarded many unit awards, including the Navy Unit Commendation, three Meritorious Unit Commendations and four Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon Submarine Squadron Battle &quot;E&quot;s.

&quot;Chicago&quot; has also been awarded several campaign and service awards, including the Navy Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, two Southwest Asia Service Medals, three Sea Service Ribbons, Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia), and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait).

One of the barracks buildings at the US Navy&#x27;s Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes is named &quot;USS &quot;Chicago&quot;&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Chicago&quot; plays a prominent role in Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;.
*&quot;Chicago&quot; is also featured prominently in the 2008 naval thriller, &quot;Black Sea Affair&quot;, by Don Brown.
*&quot;Chicago&quot;, alongside its former Sixth Fleet sister, &quot;USS Dallas&quot;, appear in the seventh mission of the 2009 video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, titled &quot;The Only Easy Day... Was Yesterday&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Key West&quot; (SSN-722), a , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after Key West, Florida.

==Construction==
The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 13 August 1981, and her keel was laid down on 6 July 1983. She was launched on 20 July 1985, sponsored by Mrs. Virginia Conn, and commissioned on 12 September 1987, with Commander Warren Lipscomb, Jr. in command. She is the fourth equipped with the vertical launch system (VLS) capable of carrying 12 Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles (TLAM).

==Service history==
&quot;Key West&quot; was home ported at the Norfolk Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia. She operated out of Norfolk, until 1995. During her Atlantic Fleet service, she completed numerous Cold War deployments and supported operations in the Caribbean, Western Atlantic and Mediterranean. &quot;Key West&quot; was awarded the &quot;Hook-em&quot; antisubmarine warfare (ASW) excellence award following her 1990 Mediterranean Cruise. She later was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation award for her superior performance in Cold War operations during the 1989 and 1990 deployments. &quot;Key West&quot; won the &quot;TOP TORP&quot; Torpedo Shooting Competition in 1992, and was later awarded the Submarine Squadron Eight Battle &quot;E&quot; for that year.

&quot;Key West&quot; deployed with the Carrier Battle Group in 1995. During that deployment she operated in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, Armed Forces Service, and NATO Service medals. Following the 1995 deployment, &quot;Key West&quot; underwent an availability in Norfolk, in preparation for her transfer to the Pacific Fleet in 1996. She departed Norfolk, in June 1996, and transited the Panama Canal as part of her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. She arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in July 1996, and began operations under Submarine Squadron One.

&quot;Key West&quot; visited her name sake city in 1987, for a week-long celebration after commissioning, 1992, and 1994. Since reassignment to the Pacific Fleet she has not been able to visit Key West again.
In April 1997, &quot;Key West&quot; conducted her first Pacific deployment with the Carrier Battle Group. During this deployment, she operated in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Later that year, &quot;Key West&quot; was reassigned to Submarine Squadron Three. In the next year, she deployed to the Eastern Pacific in support of the and Carrier Battle Groups, and later supported the 1998 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise.

From 1998 through 2001, she supported Pacific theater operations in both the Third Fleet and Seventh Fleet area of operations. During this time she participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral exercises with our Pacific Theater partner. Following the 11 September attacks, she was redirected Bahrain to the Northern Arabian Sea where she launched Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles against Afghanistan in October 2001.

In 2003, 2005 and 2007 &quot;Key West&quot; conducted deployments to the Western Pacific in support of Seventh Fleet operations.

In 2007, &quot;Key West&quot; was named &quot;Battle E&quot; for COMSUBRON THREE, given to the best submarine in its squadron, awarded the Arleigh Burke Trophy for the most improved sea command in the Pacific, and awarded the Naval Unit Commendation for its outstanding accomplishments during the deployment.

In 2009, &quot;Key West&quot; was again awarded the &quot;Battle E&quot; award for COMSUBRON Three for outstanding performance during the 2009 WESTPAC deployment.

In 2012, &quot;Key West&quot; shifted home port to Naval Base Guam to support Seventh Fleet operations as a forward deployed unit.

In 2016, &quot;Key West&quot; was again awarded the &quot;Battle E&quot; award for COMSUBRON Fifteen.

In 2018, &quot;Key West&quot; was awarded the Hugh McCraken Award for the top Chiefs Mess in the Pacific Submarine Force.

On 31 October 2022, &quot;Key West&quot; arrived at Busan, South Korea for a scheduled port visit.

&quot;Key West&quot; returned from her final deployment in November 2022.

On 16 January 2023 &quot;Key West&quot; arrived at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and was placed in the reserve fleet to await decommissioning.

==Command emblem==

The conch shell is the focal point of the submarine&#x27;s emblem for the fabled horn of the Greek God Triton and the symbol of the submarine&#x27;s namesake city. &quot;Key West&quot; is emerging from the shell which symbolizes the emergence of the city as the leading city of the Florida Keys.

The submarine insignia symbolizes the heritage that the ship has with all past and future submarines. The motto &quot;Libertate Clavis Tenacitas et Ingenium&quot; translates to &quot;The Key to Freedom is Tenacity and Resourcefulness&quot;. Specifically, the phrase &quot;The Key to Freedom&quot; represents the namesake city and the submarine&#x27;s mission to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of the American people. The phrase &quot;Tenacity and Resourcefulness&quot; was used by the Mayor of Key West during his speech at the ship&#x27;s launching to describe the characteristics of a true Conch —a native of Key West. Additionally, &quot;Ingenium&quot; is a word used by the ancient Greek and Roman historians to describe the resourcefulness and ingenuity of sailors in the period.

==In popular fiction==
In the Tom Clancy novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Key West&quot; participated in a cruise missile strike against the Soviet Union.

In the novel &quot;Kirov III-Pacific Storm&quot; by John Schettler, &quot;Key West&quot; is involved in a critical action with the Russian Battlecruiser Kirov II.

In the Swedish novel &quot;Landsförrädaren&quot; by Anders Jallai, &quot;Key West&quot; makes an appearance to save the protagonist.

<text>USS &quot;Newport News&quot; (SSN-750), a , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Newport News, Virginia. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 19 April 1982 and her keel was laid down on 3 March 1984. She was launched on 15 March 1986 sponsored by Mrs. Rosemary D. Trible, and commissioned on 3 June 1989. Mayor Jessie M. Rattley presented the ship with a commemorative plaque containing the poem &quot;Newport News,&quot; written by Newport News native Ronald W. Bell, whose poem &quot;Admiral Rickover&quot; also appears upon a plaque aboard the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine .

==Collision with Japanese ship==
On 8 January 2007, &quot;Newport News&quot; was operating submerged in the Arabian Sea south of the Straits of Hormuz when the submarine hit Japanese tanker &quot;Mogamigawa&quot;. She had been operating as part of Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8), organized around the aircraft carrier . The Carrier Strike Group was redeploying to the Indian Ocean to support a maritime cordon during the war in Somalia when the incident happened. &quot;Newport News&quot; suffered damage to her bow, but there was no damage to the sail, mast or reactor, and she made for port in Bahrain under her own power.
&quot;Newport News&quot; was escorted from the mouth of the Straits of Hormuz to Bahrain by the Guided Missile Destroyer . This was due to the fact that the submarine was unable to transit submerged and has no surface defense capabilities. During the transit, Iranian aircraft and warships shadowed the ships.
An official of the Kawasaki Kisen Company (or K Line), which owns the tanker, announced that
&quot;Mogamigawa&quot;″s hull and propellers were damaged.

According to a Navy spokesman, the collision occurred as a result of the venturi effect. The tanker passed over the area where the submarine was submerged and this created a sucking effect that forced the submarine upward to the surface.
The incident was the third collision between a US nuclear-powered submarine and a Japanese civilian ship.

On 29 January, after the boat returned to Bahrain for repairs, administrative personnel actions, also known as Admiral&#x27;s Masts, were taken against several members of her crew, which included relieving the boat&#x27;s commanding officer of command due to a lack of confidence in his ability to command.

On 10 April the Iranian Fars News Agency reported that &quot;Newport News&quot; has been leaking radioactive and chemical pollution into the Persian Gulf and claimed that following this formal complaint, the ship departed the gulf for a complete overhaul.
The US Navy Fifth Fleet denied this claim restating that damage was limited to the bow and that the sail, mast and reactors were not damaged. On 2 October 2007 the US Navy agreed to pay Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, the company that owns &quot;Mogamigawa&quot; an undisclosed amount in compensation for the collision.

<doc id="1121719" wikidata="Q2462591" url="?curid=1121719" title="Crampton locomotive">
<text>A Crampton locomotive is a type of steam locomotive designed by Thomas Russell Crampton and built by various firms from 1846. The main British builders were Tulk and Ley and Robert Stephenson and Company.

Notable features were a low boiler and large driving wheels. The crux of the Crampton patent was that the single driving axle was placed behind the firebox, so that the driving wheels could be very large. This helped to give this design a low centre of gravity, so that it did not require a very broad-gauge track to travel safely at high speeds. Its wheel arrangement was usually or .

==Design variations==

Because the single driving axle was behind the firebox, Crampton locomotives usually had outside cylinders. However, some inside cylinder versions were built using indirect drive, then known as a &quot;jackshaft&quot;. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was connected to the driving wheels by outside rods. Some long-wheelbase s were also built using this crankshaft system. The boiler feed-pump was often driven from the crankshaft as well because many Cramptons were built before the injector was invented.

Another feature on some Crampton locomotives was the use of a boiler of oval cross-section, to lower the centre of gravity. It was later seen as a major flaw, because the internal pressure would tend to push the boiler into a circular cross-section and increase the risk of fatigue.

==Usage==

Crampton locomotives were used by some British railways and speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) were achieved on the LNWR. They were more popular in France, southern Germany and the US. In France the expression &quot;prendre la Crampton&quot; meant to catch an express, and in the argot of the Saint Cyr military academy, footplate staff were known as &quot;officiers de Crampton&quot; (and this as late as 1971). One of the French examples has been preserved in the &quot;Cité du Train&quot; (the French Railway Museum) at Mulhouse and is still in working order. This is number 80 of the &quot;Chemin de Fer de l&#x27;Est&quot;, the Paris-Strasbourg line, which is named &quot;Le Continent&quot;.

==Locomotive list==

The approximate numbers of Crampton-type locomotives built in Europe were:
* Great Britain: 51
* France: 127
* Germany: 135

<text>USS &quot;Pasadena&quot; (SSN-752) is a and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Pasadena, California.

&quot;Pasadena&quot; provides the Fleet Commander or Task Force Commander a multi-mission platform. This vessel has unlimited endurance due to the nuclear propulsion plant, advanced sonar, torpedo, cruise missile, and mine delivery systems, a combination of speed and stealth due to quieting and the capacity to fulfill numerous missions.

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 30 November 1982 and her keel was laid down on 20 December 1985. She was launched on 12 September 1987 sponsored by Mrs. Pauline Trost, and commissioned on 11 February 1989 with Commander W. Fritchman in command.

Originally assigned to Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Pasadena&quot; conducted an inter-fleet transfer in October 1990 to the Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and was homeported in San Diego, California.

In July 1991, &quot;Pasadena&quot; became the first Improved 688 Class submarine to deploy, commencing a six-month Western Pacific deployment. In June 1993, she commenced a six-month Western Pacific deployment to the Persian Gulf. While deployed, &quot;Pasadena&quot; participated in several exercises with the Royal Saudi, Royal Omani and Royal Australian Navies, and was the first United States nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) to conduct exercises with the Indian Navy in the MALABAR Naval Exercise. She also became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on the Red Sea.

In March 1995, &quot;Pasadena&quot; again deployed on a six-month Western Pacific Deployment. While deployed to the Persian Gulf she became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of Muscat, Oman; the first to operate continuously inside the Persian Gulf; and the first SSN to be assigned to Commander, U.S. Fifth Fleet.

In April 1996, &quot;Pasadena&quot; changed homeports to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron Seven. From June 1996 to September 1996, &quot;Pasadena&quot; underwent a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) where she was outfitted with improved offensive and defensive weapon systems. In April 1997, &quot;Pasadena&quot; deployed to the Eastern Pacific for a four-month deployment in support of UNITAS.

From September 2011 until late 2013, &quot;Pasadena&quot; was refitted at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Her sonar, fire-control system, and navigation equipment were upgraded. Following the update, &quot;Pasadena&quot; joined her new posting, Submarine Squadron 11 in San Diego, in November 2013.

Following an intense workup from November 2013 until December 2014, &quot;Pasadena&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific for six months in January 2015. The deployment saw &quot;Pasadena&quot; conduct port visits in Yokosuka, Japan, Sasebo, Japan, Busan, South Korea, Singapore and Guam.

Following successful completion of her Drydocking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, &quot;Pasadena&quot; returned to the fleet on 31 October 2021. 

In March of 2022, she participated in ICEX 2022, which involved surfacing through the arctic ice along with the , . According to the US Navy, &quot;ICEX 2022 was a three-week exercise that allows the Navy to assess its operational readiness in the Arctic&quot;

In July of 2023, she participated in UNITAS LXIV, a multinational maritime exercise conducted annually in waters around Central and South America to enhance security cooperation and improve coalition operations. UNITAS LXIV saw &quot;Pasadena&quot; conduct port visits in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba (U.S. Naval Station), Cartagena, Colombia, and Ocho Rios, Jamaica

==Insignia==
&quot;Pasadena&quot;&#x27;s insignia is surrounded by a mooring line border with blue background, emphasizing the nautical character of the seal. The surrounding banner carries the ship&#x27;s hull number and name and bracketed by the motto. The motto, in addition to enhancing the central combative caricature, states in clear terms the readiness of today&#x27;s force to fight anywhere in the world on short notice in the national interest. The red rose ties the ship to the City of Pasadena, home of the New Year&#x27;s Day Tournament of Roses Parade, which dates back more than 100 years. The turtle pugilist ties SSN-752 to , a World War II light cruiser that earned six battle stars. The emblem for CL-65 was created for the cruiser by Walt Disney. Coincidentally, during the sub&#x27;s construction at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, CT, the crew adopted a North American Snapping Turtle as a mascot. The creature actually rode the boat into the Thames river during its launching. By the time construction was over, the turtle, named Frumpy, which originally fit into the palm of a hand, was over 18 inches long, forcing the crew to find a new home. Cal Poly in Pomona proved a willing host. To get Frumpy to the new abode, two crew members: ET1(SS) Del Laughery, and ET1(SS) Don Hilliker, both pilots, flew the turtle in a private aircraft from Groton to Pomona.

&quot;Columbus&quot; completed a Post Shipyard Availability in June 1994 in Groton, Connecticut after initial construction and shakedown operations. In September 1994, the submarine conducted an interfleet transfer to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. &quot;Columbus&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific in late 1995 through early 1996 and conducted a variety of operations as a unit of the Seventh Fleet along the way making port visits in Hong Kong, Subic Bay, Guam, and Yokosuka, Japan.

&quot;Columbus&quot; was the first submarine equipped with the BYG-1 Fire Control System in December 2002. Two successful test launches of Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) cruise missiles were conducted in late May 2003 from &quot;Columbus&quot;, while underway in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. &quot;Columbus&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for another western Pacific deployment in late 2003, and visited Jinhae-gu, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan while taking part in Annual-Ex 2003, an exercise with various units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.

In mid-April 2006 seven &quot;Columbus&quot; crewmen were charged with a variety of offenses, including assault, dereliction of duty, and hazing, for alleged attacks on two of their shipmates. The accused range from a petty officer third class (E-4) to a senior chief (E-8). A complete report on the situation was completed on 30 May. On 13 June, the Navy announced the dismissal of &quot;Columbus&quot;″s commanding officer, Commander Charles Marquez because of concerns about his &quot;ability to establish and maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct, provide the crew a safe, positive, professional environment in which to work, and maintain good order and discipline&quot;. Captain Brian McIlvaine, former commanding officer of , replaced Marquez temporarily. After a few months in command CAPT McIlvaine was replaced with CDR James Doody. At the end of a DMP (depot modernization period) In Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Columbus&quot; relocated back to Pearl Harbor on 22 December 2006.

Following a modernization refit at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 2004 to 2006 in Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Columbus&quot; returned to Submarine Squadron Seven in Pearl Harbor. She departed in March 2008 for a regularly scheduled six-month deployment with the Seventh Fleet. &quot;Columbus&quot; supported national taskings and theater security cooperation efforts while making port visits in Saipan, Guam, Okinawa, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, Japan.
In January 2009 &quot;Columbus&quot; was awarded the Submarine Squadron Seven Battle Efficiency (Battle &quot;E&quot;) award, given to the submarine crew that best demonstrates technical proficiency and continual mission readiness throughout the previous year.

In July 2009 Admiral Gary Roughead, the Chief of Naval Operations, announced that &quot;Columbus&quot; was the Pacific Fleet winner of the 2008 Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy.

&quot;Columbus&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in August 2012 after completing a six-month deployment that included Seventh Fleet and national mission tasking along with port visits to Japan, South Korea, and Guam. &quot;Columbus&quot; arrived in the South Korean southern port city of Busan on 3 March 2014 as a part of a scheduled deployment in the Western Pacific. In September 2017, &quot;Columbus&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from a six-month deployment having performing three national tasking periods, two theater operation periods, and a multinational exercise. &quot;Columbus&quot; also enjoyed four port visits, including Singapore and Guam.

&quot;Columbus&quot; is currently in drydock in Newport News Shipbuilding for overhaul.

<doc id="1121723" wikidata="Q2302375" url="?curid=1121723" title="USS Toledo (SSN-769)">
<text>USS &quot;Toledo&quot; (SSN-769), is a United States Navy, nuclear-powered attack submarine and the third U.S. Naval vessel to be named for the city of Toledo, Ohio. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 10 June 1988, and her keel was laid down on 6 May 1991. She was launched on 28 August 1993, sponsored by Mrs. Sabra Smith, and commissioned on 24 February 1995.

==History==

Her first deployment was to the Mediterranean with the Carrier Strike Group in 1997–1998, followed by a six-month tour of the North Atlantic.

===&quot;Kursk&quot; incident===

&quot;Toledo&quot; and were observing Russian naval exercises in August 2000. There, the Russian cruise missile submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; suffered a catastrophic incident and sank. Russian Navy officials initially made numerous claims that the sinking of &quot;Kursk&quot; was caused by a collision with one of the US submarines, though evidence clearly disproved such a theory; the underwater seismic signals recorded matched those of an explosion and not a collision with another vessel, and the US submarines were fully operational after the incident (there is a claim &quot;Toledo&quot; would have been severely damaged or sunk by a hypothetical collision, being less than half of &quot;Kursk&#x27;s&quot; displacement). The loss of &quot;Kursk&quot; was officially attributed to a faulty dummy torpedo leaking highly volatile high-test peroxide, setting off a chain reaction that detonated five to seven combat-ready torpedo warheads.

===2001-2006 deployments===
&quot;Toledo&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean again in late 2001-early 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

&quot;Toledo&quot; returned to the Naval Submarine Base New London in mid-April 2003 after having taken part in the Iraq War.

On 7 December 2004, &quot;Toledo&quot; returned to Groton, Connecticut, after a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf with the Carrier Strike Group that included port calls in Crete, Dubai, and Bahrain. Her route home from Bahrain was unusual, rounding the Cape of Good Hope rather than using the Suez Canal. Once back in the North Atlantic, she was diverted for a classified drug interdiction mission with the Joint Interagency Task Force–South in the Caribbean Sea.

On 31 January 2006, &quot;Toledo&quot; again departed for a six-month deployment to CENTCOM. Ports of call included Augusta Bay, Sicily, Dubai, the British Indian Ocean Territory of Diego Garcia, and La Maddalena. She returned from this deployment on 31 July 2006.

===Maintenance 2006–2009===
Northrop Grumman Corporation was awarded a contract from the U.S. Navy for maintenance work, known as a depot modernization period, on &quot;Toledo&quot;. The initial planning contract was valued at about $34.7 million. The final value, including the actual execution, was $178.5 million. She arrived in December 2006 to Newport News, and the work was completed in March 2009. The project was delayed for eight months because of approximately 2,000 project changes. This was a competitive award under a Naval Sea Systems Command multiple award contract.

In July 2009 two hull cracks, including one in her pressure hull, were discovered during a routine inspection. Although the Navy and Northrop Grumman launched two investigations into welding practices at the yard while &quot;Toledo&quot; was under maintenance, the cracks do not appear to be related to welds.

===Return to service===
&quot;Toledo&quot; left for another six-month deployment on 23 July 2010. In December 2010, she made a port call in Haifa, Israel. Commander Reckamp was received by the Haifa City Mayor Yona Yahav in the City Hall as is customary for visiting commanders of warships making port calls in Haifa.

On 20 January 2011, &quot;Toledo&quot; returned to Groton, Connecticut, after a six-month deployment that included port calls in Cyprus, Bahrain, and Haifa.

On 12 September 2019, Toledo completed an eight-month EUCOM deployment that included port calls in Faslane, Scotland and Haakonsvern, Norway.

In early 2020, YouTuber and science communicator Destin Sandlin travelled aboard &quot;Toledo&quot; for 24 hours as part of a video series profiling different features and functions of the submarine.

In May 2020, the crew of &quot;Toledo&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for an eight-month intelligence collection deployment.

<text>USS &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (SSN-763), a , is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Santa Fe, New Mexico. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 21 March 1986 and her keel was laid down on 9 July 1991. She was launched on 12 December 1992 sponsored by Mrs. Joy Johnson, and commissioned on 8 January 1994, with Commander Rodger P. Krull in command.

==Operational history==
&quot;Santa Fe&quot;&#x27;s maiden deployment was in 1997 to the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific. In 1998, she completed a Selected Restricted Availability in Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. In 1999, she was again deployed to the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation and Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 2001, she deployed to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf earning two Meritorius Unit Commendations as well as earning her first coveted CSS-7 Battle E.
&quot;Santa Fe&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific in September 2003 until March 2004. For this deployment she participated in ANNUALEX &#x27;03 with the Japanese Maritime Defense Force. The ship made port calls in Singapore, Guam, multiple times in Sasebo, Japan, and in Yokosuka, Japan in which she rode out a typhoon while in port. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, the second highest award given to a submarine, for actions completed on this deployment. She underwent a three-month Interim drydocking in October 2004.

After the ship completed sea trials and other various workups she then completed a two-month Eastern Pacific Deployment that started in May 2005. After returning to her homeport of Pearl Harbor in June 2005, she again deployed to the Western Pacific on 9 August 2005. During this deployment she participated in Exercise Malabar with the Indian Navy. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was the second U.S. nuclear submarine to participate in the exercise and also to port in Goa, India. After Malabar, the ship made a brief stop in Phuket, Thailand. She was the first U.S. submarine to visit Phuket since 2001. The ship returned to Pearl Harbor in February 2006. She made the transit to the East Coast in July 2006, surfacing near the North Pole on the way and stopping in Brest, France.

After shipyard she completed a six-month Western Pacific deployment from May–November 2009, after stops in Singapore, Saipan, Guam, Okinawa, JP, and Yokosuka, JP. 
She received the Battle &quot;E&quot; Award in January 2010.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; returned 24 August 2011 to Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam after successfully completing a six-month deployment to the western Pacific region. During this deployment &quot;Santa Fe&quot; skillfully conducted four operations of great importance to national security by safely operating in a demanding and challenging undersea environment, directly enhancing fleet, theater and national objectives. The crew displayed exceptional tactical skill, tenacity and perseverance while operating under extremely challenging conditions to prepare the battle space for future operations. &quot;Santa Fe&quot;&#x27;s tactical acumen was further displayed by their highly successful participation in Exercise Malabar, a bilateral exercise with the Indian navy. 
Port calls included Sasebo, Japan (x3), Chinhae, South Korea; Yokosuka, Japan; Guam, and Subic Bay, Philippines. 
In recognition of their outstanding performance, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; received the COMSUBRON 7 Battle &quot;E&quot; Award and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation by the Secretary of the Navy.

<doc id="1121725" wikidata="Q1249407" url="?curid=1121725" title="USS Miami (SSN-755)">
<text>USS &quot;Miami&quot; (SSN-755) was a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy. She was the third vessel of the U.S. Navy to be named after Miami, Florida. &quot;Miami&quot; was the forty-fourth &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class (688) submarine and the fifth Improved &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class (688I) submarine to be built and commissioned. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 28 November 1983, and her keel was laid down on 24 October 1986. She was launched on 12 November 1988 and commissioned on 30 June 1990 with Commander Thomas W. Mader in command.

On 1 March 2012, &quot;Miami&quot; arrived at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for a scheduled 20-month Engineered Overhaul (EOH) and system upgrades. On 23 May, a shipyard employee started a fire that spread to crew living, command and control, and torpedo spaces. Repairs were initially estimated to require three years and $450 million, an estimate later revised to a range of $450 million to $700 million.

On 6 August 2013, Navy officials said that due to budget cuts, the vessel would not be repaired. The submarine was placed on the inactive list, then decommissioned on 28 March 2014.

==History==

===1999===
&quot;Miami&quot; became the first submarine to conduct combat operations in two theaters since World War II (Operation Desert Fox and Operation Allied Force). The submarine was featured in The Learning Channel (TLC) &quot;Extreme Machine&quot; episode on &quot;Nuclear Submarines&quot;.

===2012 fire===

At 5:41 p.m. EDT on 23 May 2012, fire crews were called with a report of a fire on &quot;Miami&quot; while she was being overhauled at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. At the time, the submarine was in the second month of a scheduled 20-month maintenance cycle, indicating that she was undergoing an extensive &quot;Engineering Overhaul&quot;. The national media reported that seven firefighters had been injured. One crew member suffered broken ribs when he fell through a hole left by removed deck plates during the fire. It took firefighters 12 hours to extinguish it.

Initially, the U.S. Navy reported that the fire started when an industrial vacuum cleaner used &quot;to clean worksites on the sub after shipyard workers&#x27; shifts&quot; sucked up a heat source that ignited debris inside the vacuum. On 23 July 2012, however, civilian painter and sandblaster Casey J. Fury was indicted on two counts of arson after confessing to starting the fire. Fury said he lit rags on a berthing compartment&#x27;s top bunk so he could get out of work early. On 15 March 2013, he was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $400 million in restitution. As of March 2021, Fury was incarcerated at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey.

The debate over whether to repair or scrap &quot;Miami&quot; lasted more than a year. Within a month of the fire, Maine Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe advocated repairing the submarine. In July 2012, Navy leaders asked Congress to add $220 million to the operations and maintenance budget for emergent and unfunded ship repairs. In August, the Navy decided to repair the boat for an estimated total cost of $450 million. The repair cost was expected to be trimmed by using spare parts from the recently decommissioned and by repairing rather than replacing damaged hull sections, as had been done with another &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class boat, . But both of these approaches proved unworkable with the newer &quot;Miami.&quot; As well, a detailed assessment raised the estimated repair bill to $700 million.

On 6 August 2013, the U.S. Navy announced its intention to decommission &quot;Miami&quot;, concluding the cost was more than it could afford in a time of budget cuts. The sub was officially decommissioned on 28 March 2014, to be disposed of via the nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

<text>USS &quot;Scranton&quot; (SSN-756), a , is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Scranton, Pennsylvania.

The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 26 November 1984, and construction began on 29 August 1986. She was launched on 3 July 1989 sponsored by Mrs. Sarah McDade, and commissioned on 26 January 1991, with Commander J.G. Meyer in command.

&quot;Scranton&quot; was the first submarine at Newport News to be built via &quot;modular construction&quot;. No keel was laid. In this method, the ship was almost fully built out in individual hull sections. Most of the internal structure, machinery, and piping were loaded in via open ends of the hull sections as each hull section was built out. The individual hull sections were later assembled with exact precision such that piping running between the sections was joined as the hull sections were welded together. The ship was later rolled into a floating drydock and &quot;floated&quot;

In January 2006, &quot;Scranton&quot; successfully demonstrated homing and docking of an AN/BLQ-11 Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System (LMRS) unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) system during at-sea testing under the leadership of Commanding Officer Michael J Quinn.

==Operation Odyssey Dawn==
On 19 March 2011, the submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at Libyan air defenses as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.

<doc id="1121735" wikidata="Q5122952" url="?curid=1121735" title="CityFlyer Express">
<text>CityFlyer Express was a short-haul regional airline with its head office in the Iain Stewart Centre next to London Gatwick Airport in England.

In 1993 it became the first British Airways (BA) franchisee operating as &quot;British Airways Express&quot;. CityFlyer&#x27;s ownership passed to BA in 1999 when that company bought out the original promoters as well as 3i, the airline&#x27;s main shareholder at the time. Initially, CityFlyer continued to operate as a separate unit, but it was eventually absorbed into British Airways&#x27; mainline short haul operation at Gatwick in 2001, the result of a change in British Airways&#x27; strategy for its Gatwick operation.

Following its absorption into British Airways, the airline&#x27;s turboprops were retired, while the company&#x27;s fleet of regional short-haul jetliners and the associated crews were transferred to British Airways&#x27; regional operation in Birmingham and Manchester. This in turn resulted in British Airways mainline short haul crews based at Gatwick operating most of the erstwhile CityFlyer Express routes using the former&#x27;s Gatwick-based Boeing 737 fleet.

==History==


===CityFlyer&#x27;s origins===
CityFlyer Express can be traced back to the formation of Connectair in 1983. Connectair became a feeder airline for British Caledonian, at the time the UK&#x27;s so-called Second Force airline, on 30 May 1984 when it commenced a regional scheduled service between Gatwick and Antwerp with a single, leased Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante turboprop. A small number of larger capacity, more efficient Shorts 330 turboprops eventually replaced the Embraer Bandeirante.

There was joint ticketing for both airlines, Connectair flight numbers were prefixed with British Caledonian&#x27;s BR designator, the two-letter International Air Transport Association code identifying the airline on whose behalf a flight is operated, and all of the company&#x27;s aircraft were painted in the &quot;British Caledonian Commuter&quot; livery. However, this relationship stopped short of a franchise agreement.

Following British Airways&#x27; takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987, Connectair operated its flights under the UK flag carrier&#x27;s BA designator without adopting the British Airways livery for an interim period.

===The ILG era===
In June 1988 the firm was acquired by the International Leisure Group (ILG), the parent company of Air Europe. Following ILG&#x27;s acquisition of Connectair, the airline was re-branded &quot;Air Europe Express&quot; and adopted a new corporate identity as of 1 February 1989.

ILG&#x27;s decision to purchase Connectair was part of Air Europe&#x27;s corporate strategy at the time to establish itself as a major short haul scheduled operator at its Gatwick base. Gatwick had become very busy during the late 1980s. This meant that the much-coveted early-morning peak time slots, which Air Europe needed to be able to operate at times that were attractive to business travellers as well as competitive with its rivals&#x27; departure and arrival times, were in increasingly short supply. Connectair held a fairly large number of conveniently timed slots at Gatwick, which it had accumulated since its &quot;British Caledonian Commuter&quot; days. ILG&#x27;s acquisition of Connectair therefore represented a golden opportunity to substantially increase the number of slots the group&#x27;s airlines controlled at Gatwick, thereby strengthening Air Europe&#x27;s competitive position at that airport.

Air Europe Express flew under the same AE airline designator as its bigger sister airline.

Its scheduled services initially linked Gatwick with Antwerp and Rotterdam.

Larger Shorts 360s gradually replaced the Shorts 330s.

In addition, ILG purchased Guernsey Airlines in April 1989, another small, independent regional airline, which operated scheduled services between Guernsey and Gatwick as well as between Guernsey and Manchester at the time. On 29 October 1989 ILG fully integrated Guernsey Airlines into its existing Air Europe Express operation.

These moves provided Air Europe with additional transfer traffic for its developing short haul European scheduled route network. They also enabled Air Europe to launch new routes where there was insufficient traffic to support its larger Boeing 737 and Fokker 100 jet aircraft or where these aircraft were too big to provide a frequent schedule during the start-up phase, such as Gatwick—Düsseldorf and Gatwick—Jersey for instance.

Following the replacement of the Air Europe Express Shorts 360 turboprops with Air Europe&#x27;s larger and faster Fokker 100 jets on the Gatwick—Düsseldorf and Gatwick—Jersey routes, Air Europe Express launched a new thrice-daily Gatwick—Birmingham schedule with its Shorts 360s.

During the year ending August 1990 the Air Europe Express operation carried more than a quarter of a million passengers across its route network for the first time.

Air Europe Express was forced to halt its operations on 8 March 1991 along with its sister airlines in the ILG-controlled Airlines of Europe group as a result of its parent company&#x27;s decision to put all the group&#x27;s companies into administrative receivership on that day, even though Air Europe Express itself had remained profitable throughout that period.

===A new beginning===
The management of Air Europe Express quickly started a new airline, Euroworld Airways, and began operations in May 1991 using two Shorts 360 aircraft and staff from the old Air Europe Express. The new carrier also carried on night freight and mail contracts from the defunct airline. The airline soon began flights from Gatwick to Guernsey, Antwerp and Rotterdam, for which two additional Shorts 360s were purchased. At this time, the airline approached several large carriers with a view to establishing a link, but in the event only British Airways was to show any interest, and a code share agreement was struck between the two.

====Choosing a new corporate identity====
The airline rebranded as CityFlyer Express in 1992.

1992 also marked CityFlyer&#x27;s second year of operation, during which it managed to break even for the first time. (It had recorded a loss of £0.5mn in its first year of operation.) From this point onwards, the airline was to post a consistent profit.

====Launching a new generation of turboprop planes in the UK====
CityFlyer Express was the UK launch customer for the ATR 42 regional turboprop, acquiring two in 1992.

In the same year Aer Lingus abandoned the Gatwick to Dublin service, allowing CityFlyer to step in with a daily service.

BA&#x27;s takeover of Dan-Air also left the Gatwick to Newcastle route vacant for the airline to assume, offering a three-times daily service and requiring a third ATR 42.

The addition of Düsseldorf to the network in 1993 and a frequency increase on the Dublin route led to the acquisition of a fourth ATR.

===Formalisation of code-share relationship with British Airways===
Meanwhile, the code share agreement had resulted in several complaints being lodged with British Airways by customers expecting a BA flight and the BA product.

BA proposed a solution to this by offering CityFlyer a franchise agreement, which it accepted. This occasion marked the conclusion of the first-ever franchise agreement between British Airways and another airline. It also marked the conclusion of the first franchise agreement in the UK airline industry.

Under this arrangement the CityFlyer aircraft would be painted in full BA livery with interiors and cabin layout conforming to BA&#x27;s contemporary, standard two-class European product. Staff would wear BA uniforms and all flights would operate under BA flight numbers. British Airways itself would take over CityFlyer&#x27;s marketing and handle all reservations on its behalf. To all intents and purposes, CityFlyer Express would present itself and trade as British Airways.

The deal came into effect in June 1993.

===Further expansion===
The franchise agreement allowed CityFlyer Express to take advantage of the UK flag carrier&#x27;s marketing clout, pricing power as well as its global distribution system (GDS) and worldwide sales force.

The airline was again UK launch customer for the larger, 66-seat ATR 72, the first of which was delivered in October 1994.

By the end of the 1995 financial year, CityFlyer served ten destinations.

===Ushering in the jet age===
CityFlyer Express acquired its first jet aircraft in March 1997 when it became the first UK-based airline to introduce the Avro RJ100. A second Avro RJ100 was acquired in May of that year. Three more were added in 1998 and a further two joined the fleet in 1999. (At the time, the airline also operated six ATR 42s, one of which was returned to its lessor in 1999, as well as five larger ATR 72s. Three additional ATR 72s were delivered in 1999. Eventually, these replaced the remaining ATR 42s.)

By the turn of the millennium the company&#x27;s jet fleet had expanded to 16 RJ100s.

===Selling out to British Airways===
With the franchise agreement due to end in 1999, CityFlyer Express was the second largest slot holder at Gatwick Airport (behind British Airways). It held 96 daily slots at Gatwick, employed 677 people and returned a pre-tax profit of £6.4mn on sales of £89.4mn. The airline&#x27;s shareholders took the opportunity to realise their investment and put the airline up for sale. HSBC was appointed to handle the process, and approached a number of carriers about the sale. Of the airlines approached, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic stated their interest to acquire the airline.

At the time Virgin chairman Richard Branson attacked British Airways&#x27; intention to bid for CityFlyer Express by claiming publicly that it already had a &quot;total monopoly&quot; at Heathrow and now wanted a &quot;total monopoly&quot; at Gatwick as well, thereby undermining its rivals&#x27; ability to compete with it on a level playing field.
Disregarding a publicly stated offer from Virgin Atlantic to purchase the company for £100mn, HSBC announced the sale of CityFlyer Express to Virgin&#x27;s arch-rival British Airways for £75mn in November 1998. This immediately caused controversy, with Richard Branson stating that HSBC never responded to Virgin&#x27;s offer despite numerous requests from Virgin. CityFlyer&#x27;s management defended its decision to sell to British Airways by stating that it had never received Virgin&#x27;s bid in the first place.

This resulted in the already agreed takeover of CityFlyer Express by British Airways being referred to the Competition Commission.

The Competition Commission eventually cleared the sale of CityFlyer Express to British Airways for £75mn in 1999. However, it also imposed a ceiling on the maximum number of slots British Airways and its newly acquired subsidiary CityFlyer Express were allowed to hold at Gatwick.

According to this ruling, British Airways and CityFlyer could control a combined maximum of 41% of all Gatwick slots on an annual basis as well as no more than 70% of the airport&#x27;s slots on an hourly basis and up to 65% of these slots within a two-hour time span. These limits were designed to enable other airlines to offer competitive schedules on short haul routes where British Airways or CityFlyer was the sole or dominant carrier, without resorting to compulsory slot transfers that would have impeded British Airways&#x27; ability to run an effective hub-and-spoke operation at Gatwick.

====Background to British Airways&#x27; acquisition of CityFlyer Express====
The main reason for British Airways&#x27; acquisition of CityFlyer Express was the fact that CityFlyer held about 13% of Gatwick slots at the time. BA did not want these to fall into any competitor&#x27;s hands. BA also needed CityFlyer&#x27;s slots to expand its Gatwick operation so that it could offer enough feeder services that would help it turn around its loss-making operation at the airport by improving long haul load factors. It was hoped that this would shore up the profitability of the UK flag carrier&#x27;s long haul routes from Gatwick, thereby enabling it to return the entire Gatwick operation to profitability in the long term.

CityFlyer and its predecessor Connectair had a proven track record of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was in stark contrast to BA&#x27;s mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick as a result of the British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA&#x27;s mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low-cost, short haul unit within BA&#x27;s mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul loads and profits at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly overheads of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the revenue environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA&#x27;s long haul services at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the direct operating costs of BA&#x27;s mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick&#x27;s revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick.

=====BA&#x27;s inability to operate profitably at Gatwick following the acquisition of British Caledonian and Dan-Air=====
The prime causes for BA&#x27;s inability to operate profitably at Gatwick are:

* The unwieldy route structure it inherited from British Caledonian.
* The Monopolies and Mergers Commission&#x27;s decision to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to its competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian&#x27;s short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to award these routes to rival airlines.
* Its failure to transform the short haul operation inherited from Dan-Air into a low-cost unit within the Gatwick mainline short haul operation.
* The fact that on identical routes with the same fare structure its costs at Gatwick are only marginally lower than at Heathrow, whereas load factors, revenues and yields — the profit per passenger — are significantly lower at Gatwick than at Heathrow.
* Gatwick&#x27;s location and its smaller catchment area compared with Heathrow.

The route structure with which BA was left following its takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987 was notable for the unplanned and unsystematic manner in which it had grown since the early 1960s.

At the time Sir Freddie Laker had begun building up British United Airways&#x27; scheduled route network in his capacity as that airline&#x27;s managing director. In those days only very limited opportunities existed for wholly privately owned, independent airlines to provide fully fledged scheduled air services on major domestic and international trunk routes. This resulted in a poor fit of many routes in British United&#x27;s network of scheduled services, thereby making it difficult to offer sensible connections that could be marketed to the travelling public. It also represented the best network structure the late Sir Freddie was able to put in place under the then prevailing regulatory regime.

British Caledonian, which BA acquired at the end of 1987 in what was widely acknowledged to be a rescue deal to prevent that airline from going under and its assets to pass into the hands of foreign-owned or -controlled competitors, had inherited British United&#x27;s scheduled route structure at the time of its creation in late November 1970 when that carrier was taken over by Caledonian Airways.

The most fitting description for the resulting network of domestic, European and intercontinental long haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes resembling a rag bag. This made it difficult to develop profitable streams of transfer traffic using Gatwick as a hub. For this reason it was always going to be a challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like Genoa or Jersey in order to make an onward connection at the airport to what many people would consider secondary places in Africa or South America, and an even greater challenge to do this profitably.

At the height of its commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, British Caledonian managed to turn the dilemma the structure of its route network presented to its advantage by focusing on those routes that carried a very high proportion of potentially very profitable, oil-related, premium business traffic. It even managed to become the preferred carrier of many high-ranking oil industry executives based in Texas, the centre of the global oil industry, by providing convenient, hassle-free connections between Houston/Dallas, Lagos and Tripoli via the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base. However, the downside of this initially successful strategy was that it made the company dependent on a small number of markets whose fortunes were tied to the commodity price cycle, in often unstable parts of the world, for most of its profits.

Although this worked in British Caledonian&#x27;s favour when the price of a barrel of crude oil was sky-high during the late &#x27;70s/early &#x27;80s, it started working against it when the oil price collapsed in the mid-&#x27;80s. It also further compounded the firm&#x27;s growing financial problems at the time, culminating in the financial crisis that led to its takeover by archrival BA.

In July 1987 BA publicly announced its intention to take over its ailing, home-grown rival British Caledonian. This led to a counter bid from ILG who sought to take over British Caledonian themselves and merge it with Air Europe.

Although Air Europe eventually failed to merge with British Caledonian, its management succeeded in having the rival BA bid referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), a forerunner of today&#x27;s Competition Commission, by claiming that this deal would destroy the UK&#x27;s entire independent airline sector if approved without requiring BA to make any concessions to redress the resulting competitive imbalance.

The decision by the MMC to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian&#x27;s most important short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision by the CAA to award all of these routes to rival, independent airlines left BA&#x27;s Gatwick operation with only ten short haul routes. This reduction in the number of short haul routes the airline continued to serve from Gatwick was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the company&#x27;s Gatwick-based short haul fleet from 14 to ten Boeing 737-200 Advanced aircraft.

The routes the CAA had awarded BA&#x27;s independent rivals included the most profitable former British Caledonian short haul routes that had generated a substantial amount of transfer traffic for that airline&#x27;s Gatwick-based scheduled operation, such as London Gatwick — Paris Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick—Brussels. It also included a number of British Caledonian&#x27;s loss-making domestic routes, such as Gatwick—Glasgow, Gatwick—Edinburgh and Gatwick—Manchester, which were important feeder services for that airline&#x27;s profitable long haul routes.

The loss of these vital routes to rival airlines and the consequent reduction in the number of passengers making connections between BA&#x27;s short and long haul flights at Gatwick threatened the company&#x27;s ability to continue operating profitably on the long haul routes it had inherited at Gatwick from British Caledonian.

BA&#x27;s acquisition of the bulk of Dan-Air&#x27;s scheduled activities at the end of October 1992 was intended to create the basis for a new in-house, low-cost unit that would enable the airline to reverse the heavy losses its own mainline operation&#x27;s Gatwick-based short haul services incurred by transferring its entire short haul operation at the airport to the new unit.

To attain this goal, BA&#x27;s management unilaterally imposed the pay scales and terms of the old Dan-Air employment contracts on the entire workforce of its Gatwick-based short haul operation at the beginning of 1993. This effectively cut average pay for everyone by 20%.

Management hoped this decision would help bring its short haul operation&#x27;s costs in line with what Gatwick&#x27;s revenue environment could sustain to enable it to return to profitability.

However, BA&#x27;s unilateral decision to force everyone working for its short haul operation at Gatwick to take a pay cut caused bitter feelings towards the company, among both former Dan-Air staff as well as BA&#x27;s existing employees at Gatwick who were already working for its short haul operation there prior to Dan-Air&#x27;s acquisition. The former, who were now officially members of the BA family, were upset that they did not enjoy the same pay and terms of employment as the other family members who were working for its long haul operation at the same airport as well as those who were based at Heathrow. The latter were equally upset at having their pay and terms of employment downgraded to what they considered the inferior standards of a charter airline, which their employer had saved from bankruptcy at the eleventh hour.

The resulting unrest among BA&#x27;s Gatwick-based short haul staff culminated in an unofficial, one-day strike during the first quarter of 1993. As a result of this unofficial industrial action, BA was forced to reverse its earlier decision to cut its Gatwick-based short haul workers&#x27; pay unilaterally. These events had clearly demonstrated the power of BA&#x27;s unionised workforce. The power of the unions representing the affected workers as well as the entrenched attitudes of the middle management within BA&#x27;s complex, hierarchical organisation also meant that the airline was unable to win any concessions that would have helped it offset the additional costs it was going to face in its short haul operation at Gatwick against increased labour productivity, in return for not cutting those workers&#x27; pay.

Therefore, BA&#x27;s attempt to extend the lower pay scales and less generous terms of employment that prevailed at Dan-Air to align the costs of its short haul operation at Gatwick with the airport&#x27;s revenue environment eventually turned out to be a costly failure.

BA&#x27;s failure to simplify its complex, hierarchical organisation to enable it to reduce its overheads has been the main reason that has until now prevented the airline from achieving a cost structure that would make its Gatwick operation profitable. This situation has been further compounded by the fact that the company enjoys fewer economies of scale at Gatwick compared with Heathrow because the firm&#x27;s operation at the former airport is smaller than the one at the latter.

As a general rule, on average, a full-service scheduled operation at Gatwick with a fare structure that is identical to a similar operation at Heathrow produces a 10% lower load factor. It also generates a 20% lower revenue and results in an up to 25% lower yield.

Although the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airlines on an ever-increasing number of UK domestic and European routes since the late 1990s has rendered this rule largely invalid for short to medium haul operations, it is still valid for most long haul operations where the competition from low-cost airlines is still in its infancy.

Heathrow&#x27;s and Gatwick&#x27;s respective geographic location as well as the number of people living within each airport&#x27;s catchment area accounts for this difference in load factors, revenues and yields.

The former has a bigger catchment area than the latter because more people live north of the Thames than south of it. Heathrow&#x27;s catchment area includes about three-quarters of London&#x27;s population and roughly two-thirds of the population in the whole of Southeast England. London is where most of the demand for air travel in the Southeast originates. This means that 5.6mn people in London live in Heathrow&#x27;s catchment area as opposed to 1.9mn in Gatwick&#x27;s catchment area (out of an estimated total Greater London population of 7.5mn). The comparable figures for the Southeast are: 6.7mn people in Heathrow&#x27;s catchment area as opposed to 3.3mn in Gatwick&#x27;s catchment area (out of an estimated total population of 10mn).

This is of particular significance for the premium travel market as Heathrow&#x27;s larger catchment area means that it is able to offer more frequent flights to a greater number of destinations with more conveniently timed connections. This, in turn, helps attract a greater number of business travellers who generally tend to be the airlines&#x27; most profitable customers. It also means that there are four to five business travellers in Heathrow&#x27;s catchment area for every business traveller in Gatwick&#x27;s catchment area.

On the other hand, the differing sizes of Heathrow&#x27;s and Gatwick&#x27;s catchment areas are far less significant for non-premium travel as many people are prepared to travel to an airport outside their catchment area to take advantage of a cheaper flight.

However, the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airlines at Luton and Stansted respectively in recent years has somewhat diminished Heathrow&#x27;s advantage in terms of its catchment area, as far as short to medium haul flights are concerned. Like Heathrow, these airports are located north of the Thames where most of the people in London and the Southeast live and their catchment areas, particularly Luton&#x27;s, overlap with it.

=====BA&#x27;s failed attempt at a &quot;virtual&quot; merger with American Airlines=====
During the summer of 1996 BA announced that it was planning to enter into a new code- and revenue- as well as profit-sharing alliance with American Airlines.

The planned alliance was the most ambitious and far-reaching commercial airline alliance attempted at the time. It was also dependent on being granted anti-trust immunity by the British Government and the United States Department of Justice as well as the European Commission&#x27;s Competition Directorate. This mega alliance was meant to replace the much more limited code-share agreement BA had with US Airways since the beginning of 1993, which was not dependent on anti-trust immunity.

The new alliance envisaged merging the transatlantic operations of both airlines by combining all their commercial activities into a joint company, thus making it a &quot;virtual&quot; merger. One of the new alliance&#x27;s most outstanding features was a plan for an hourly shuttle service between London Heathrow and New York John F Kennedy, the world&#x27;s busiest and most profitable intercontinental air route.

This meant that BA, which at the time only controlled about 38% of all take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, needed to secure additional prime time slots at Heathrow in order to be able to launch the hourly JFK shuttle. In those days secondary slot trading, where airlines buy and sell take-off and landing slots at congested airports, was still in its infancy and there was uncertainty concerning the legality of this activity.

In anticipation of gaining all necessary approvals for the proposed alliance — including anti-trust immunity, BA decided to reserve the required slots at Heathrow by moving all long-haul services to East, Central and Southern Africa (other than those to South Africa itself) as well as to Latin America to Gatwick over the 1996 summer timetable period as well as the 1996/7 winter timetable period. BA chose to transfer these routes to Gatwick because they generated lower traffic volumes and were therefore less profitable than its routes to North America, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent as well as the Far East. They also carried relatively few transfer passengers. This meant that the risk of losing these passengers to a competitor because of Gatwick&#x27;s smaller number of connections compared with Heathrow was fairly low.

BA furthermore decided to transfer a number of barely profitable or wholly loss-making, short haul routes to secondary destinations in the UK and Eastern Europe to Gatwick because BA could use these slots far more profitably to operate additional transatlantic services from Heathrow under this alliance.

With the benefit of hindsight, BA had underestimated the strength of the gathering opposition to its planned &quot;virtual&quot; merger with American Airlines. It had also underestimated its opponents&#x27; political clout with the regulatory authorities in the UK and the US as well as the European Union.

At the time Sir Richard Branson publicly referred to this mega alliance as the &quot;alliance from hell&quot;. He feared that it was part of a new BA strategy to drive Virgin Atlantic, BA&#x27;s main UK-based transatlantic competitor, out of business. He therefore wanted to have it stopped at any cost.

BA&#x27;s US-based transatlantic rivals, especially those that were denied access to Heathrow under the stringent Bermuda II regulatory regime, wanted approval of this alliance to be made dependent upon the successful negotiation of a new UK-US &quot;Open Skies&quot; air services agreement that would supersede Bermuda II and remove all access restrictions to Heathrow.

Eventually, the alliance was effectively killed off when regulators on both sides of the Atlantic demanded that BA should hand over hundreds of slots at Heathrow and that anti-trust immunity should be withheld for the Heathrow—JFK &quot;flagship&quot; route.

At the same time, BA&#x27;s senior management had become so preoccupied with this alliance that it did not pay any attention to the fundamental changes that were beginning to re-shape the airline industry at the time. These changes were going to have a profound effect on the commercial environment in which BA was operating. They included the inexorable rise of the low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airlines, first and foremost EasyJet and Ryanair, in BA&#x27;s own backyard as well as the growing competitive threat posed by the government-assisted recovery of Lufthansa and Air France, BA&#x27;s main European full-service, network airline rivals, both of which had been in no position to challenge BA commercially in the early to mid-1990s as they were effectively bankrupt at that time.

For all these reasons the grandiose BA-AA alliance ultimately turned out to be a very costly distraction for BA&#x27;s management and was the main contributing factor that led to Robert Ayling&#x27;s downfall who happened to be the BA chief executive during that period.

=====Project Jupiter=====
Project &quot;Jupiter&quot; was BA&#x27;s internal working title for the strategy it had devised to turn the struggling Gatwick operation into a fully fledged hub.

The airline reckoned that this would enable it to turn around the poor overall financial performance of its operation at the airport after years of heavy losses.

BA decided to give its operation there the economies of scale as well as the scope, in terms of flight connections, it considered necessary to attract enough travellers who were prepared to pay fares that were sufficiently high-yield to achieve sustained profitability.

The aim was to make Gatwick the second biggest hub-and-spoke operation on BA&#x27;s network as well as one of the biggest outside the US.

Within three years from the launch of Project &quot;Jupiter&quot;, the BA mainline operation more than doubled the number of long haul aircraft at Gatwick and increased the number of short haul aircraft at the airport by more than half. In addition, the airline&#x27;s franchisees, notably CityFlyer Express and GB Airways, increased their Gatwick-based fleets as well. During that period the number of BA passengers passing through Gatwick also doubled.
The role BA had assigned its franchisees generally and CityFlyer in particular to make Project &quot;Jupiter&quot; work was to provide feeder services that were expected to be profitable in their own right and enable transfer passengers to connect at ease with BA&#x27;s long haul services at Gatwick, thereby improving those services&#x27; load factors and increasing their profitability. Unlike some of the North American commuter carriers that operate under franchise agreements on the same routes as their mainline partners using smaller aircraft at less busy times, BA&#x27;s franchisees only operated on routes the company&#x27;s mainline short haul operation could not serve profitably from Gatwick itself due to its higher cost base.

By the turn of the millennium, BA, the firm&#x27;s franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partners in the Oneworld global airline alliance together controlled about 40% of all take-off and landing slots at Gatwick and used a fleet of more than 100 aircraft to serve around 120 destinations worldwide from the airport, more than any other airline from any airport in the UK. Together they carried 8m passengers through Gatwick annually. This accounted for almost 30% of the total number of passengers passing through the airport each year during that period. 45% of the passengers travelling with BA and its affiliated carriers through Gatwick were changing flights there. At the time, CityFlyer Express and the other BA franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partner airlines at Gatwick accounted for 1,000 of these passengers each day.

Ultimately, BA&#x27;s attempt to make its Gatwick operation profitable by building it up into a full-scale hub-and-spoke operation failed.

When Rod Eddington took over as BA&#x27;s chief executive in 2000, he initiated a root-and-branch review of the airline&#x27;s worldwide operation with the aim of improving profitability after it had incurred its first net loss since privatisation during the 1999/2000 financial year.

This included a review of the loss-making Gatwick operation.

At the time Eddington stated that BA&#x27;s Gatwick operation alone had incurred a loss of £40mn before allocating overheads, in spite of having £4.5bn of assets at the airport, and that it was destroying shareholder value. (Industry sources estimated that during the aforesaid period the total loss for the airline&#x27;s entire Gatwick operation was £200mn after allocating all overheads.)

Eddington attributed this loss to Gatwick&#x27;s failure to attract sufficient high-yield traffic. He furthermore stated that Gatwick&#x27;s loss was entirely accounted for by its mainline short haul operation whose schedules were primarily designed to feed BA&#x27;s long haul services at the airport. Eddington was of the opinion that this was the wrong way around because there were not enough early morning departures and late-evening arrivals that could have attracted a greater number of locally based business and leisure passengers requiring same-day-return facilities. Also, the long haul route network BA operated from Gatwick at the time strangely resembled the long haul route structure British Caledonian had inherited from British United at the time of its inception three decades earlier. Moreover, in his opinion, the physical constraints imposed on BA&#x27;s Gatwick operation by the airport&#x27;s single runway and two terminals meant that the airline could not offer truly competitive schedules, in terms of frequencies and conveniently timed connections. In addition, Eddington also felt that Gatwick&#x27;s operation was far too fragmented, in terms of what he called the airport&#x27;s &quot;bewildering array&quot; of operators and their equipment, which substantially increased costs. At the time, in addition to BA&#x27;s mainline operation, which accounted for the bulk of the airline&#x27;s scheduled services at Gatwick, all of its UK-based franchisees (with the exception of British Mediterranean and Loganair) as well as the company&#x27;s subsidiaries and partners provided scheduled services at the airport as well, in some cases with a single aircraft on one route only, operating all aircraft types in their combined inventory except Concorde and some of the smaller commuter planes.

Independent analysts were also of the opinion that the long haul routes BA chose to transfer from Heathrow to Gatwick mainly served what many people considered secondary destinations in Africa and Latin America. These were generally not the type of destinations to which business people, including those living in Gatwick&#x27;s catchment area, were travelling. On the other hand, popular destinations for business and leisure travel, such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Hong Kong or Singapore were either under-served or not served at all. For instance, at the time BA operated Gatwick&#x27;s only daily service to New York JFK and there were no direct services from the airport to any of the other aforementioned destinations.

These analysts furthermore pointed to the extent and speed of BA&#x27;s growth in employment at the airport during that time as a major cause of the huge loss incurred by that operation. Within a relatively short time span of only three years, the airline had increased its headcount at Gatwick alone to 8,500. This was more than the entire 7,700-strong worldwide workforce of British Caledonian at its peak during the early part of the summer in 1986. BA had effectively created a miniature version of its Heathrow-based organisational hierarchy at Gatwick, thereby multiplying its overheads and increasing its cost base at the latter airport.

In October 2000 BA publicly announced its decision to de-hub Gatwick and to turn it into a regional Southeast airport primarily serving leisure-orientated point-to-point routes where most of the demand originated in the Gatwick catchment area.

This was part of a new strategy designed to provide services from Gatwick only if there was sufficient demand in the local catchment area and to do it at a cost the local revenue environment could support.

It was also part of a strategy to deny the low-cost airlines generally and EasyJet in particular the physical space, in terms of airport slots, to continue expanding unabated in the Southeast. The aim of this secondary strategy was to prevent these carriers from posing an ever-greater threat to BA&#x27;s high-cost, mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which suffered annual losses to the tune of several hundred million pounds during that period.

BA therefore decided to move all predominantly business-orientated long haul routes (other than those that had to stay at Gatwick due to bilateral constraints, such as its non-stop services to Atlanta, Dallas and Houston) back to Heathrow. The airline also decided to withdraw all loss-making services from the airport and to simplify its Gatwick-based fleet by reducing the number of aircraft stationed there and operating only two different aircraft types from the airport. Henceforth, all short to medium haul services from Gatwick were to be exclusively operated with Boeing 737s, while Boeing 777s were to be the only aircraft to ply the long haul routes from the airport.

This was accompanied by a reduction in BA&#x27;s headcount at Gatwick to 3,000 as well as the introduction of a common cabin crew pool for both its short and long haul operations at the airport and a number of other cost-cutting measures.

=== British Airways&#x27; short haul reorganisation ===
Under the franchise agreement it had concluded with BA before being taken over in 1999, CityFlyer Express initially operated as an independent business unit within British Airways serving a number of short haul European and UK regional routes from Gatwick that were completely separate from the services BA&#x27;s mainline operation provided from the airport.

However, following BA&#x27;s decision to abandon its hub-and-spoke strategy at Gatwick in October 2000, CityFlyer was subsumed into British Airways&#x27; mainline operation at Gatwick in 2001, thereby ceasing to exist as a separate entity.

There were two reasons for fully integrating CityFlyer into BA&#x27;s mainline short haul operation at Gatwick.

The first of these was operational. Although CityFlyer remained a profitable business in its own right following its acquisition by BA and industry analysts familiar with the company expected it to generate a profit of at least £7mn during BA&#x27;s 2000/1 financial year, BA found that franchising overall had not been the financial success it had hoped. There were too many franchisees whose administrative and sales support actually cost the airline more than the additional revenue resulting from franchise fees and the connecting traffic its franchise partners generated. Therefore, as far as the bigger picture was concerned, BA&#x27;s senior management felt that the franchise agreements with its various franchisees, all of which were profitable in their own right, had benefited the franchisees more than itself.

The second reason was related to maintaining good industrial relations between management and the workforce, especially those working for the mainline short haul operation at Gatwick. These workers had always regarded the concept of franchising generally and CityFlyer Express in particular as a Trojan horse. They feared that BA&#x27;s long-term strategy was to hand over its entire, heavily loss-making, mainline short haul operation to profitable franchisees such as CityFlyer, thereby threatening many jobs and the terms of employment of the remaining mainline employees. They also feared that BA would eventually resemble a &quot;virtual&quot; airline.

Therefore, BA&#x27;s senior management decided that it was prudent to reduce the number of franchise agreements and to make use of franchisees only if it gave BA a presence in markets it did not already serve itself and where there was no prospect of providing such a service profitably through its mainline operation.

Following the integration of CityFlyer Express into BA&#x27;s mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, all former CityFlyer employees other than flight crew and engineers working on the jet fleet were made redundant. The ex-CityFlyer flight crew and engineers whom BA continued to employ were transferred along with their equipment to BA&#x27;s regional bases in Birmingham and Manchester.

BA&#x27;s subsequent decision to retire the former CityFlyer turboprop fleet, resulted in the withdrawal of the airline&#x27;s services from Gatwick to Antwerp, Guernsey and Rotterdam.

In addition, the fact that the integration of low-cost CityFlyer Express into the high-cost BA mainline short haul operation at Gatwick inevitably meant that formerly profitable CityFlyer routes were now burdened with the expensive BA mainline overheads, necessitated the withdrawal of additional BA short haul services from Gatwick over the course of a few years, including CityFlyer&#x27;s routes to Cologne and Düsseldorf.

At the same time, British Regional Airlines, another British Airways franchise operator based on the Isle of Man, was acquired by British Airways as well and in 2002 was merged with British Airways&#x27; wholly owned regional subsidiary Brymon Airways to form British Airways Citiexpress, which would assume the operation of domestic and European services from UK regional airports.

On 1 February 2006, British Airways Citiexpress was renamed BA Connect.

<text>Taddiport is a hamlet in North Devon, England, near Great Torrington. The name is believed to derive from toad, a place where toads were found. In the Middle Ages it was a leper colony. A field system next to the hamlet is still divided up as for the medieval strip system of farming. During the years of operation of the Rolle Canal the canal had a quay across the river Torridge from Taddiport.
Taddiport appears on the early 15th century Evesham world map; its inclusion has led many to believe that the map-maker hailed from the small hamlet.

<text>The Lotus Exige is a sports car made by the British company Lotus Cars from 2000 until 2021. Originally a coupé version of the Lotus Elise roadster, since the Series 3 the Exige has been the larger-engined model of the family, featuring a V6 engine in place of the Elise&#x27;s straight-four. Convertible versions of both models are available.
== Series 1 ==
The original Exige was launched in 2000 with a naturally aspirated 1.8 L Rover K Series Inline-four engine in VHPD (Very High Performance Derivative) tune. It is rated at at 7,800 rpm in standard form. There was also a &quot;track spec&quot; version with available. The car has a five-speed manual gearbox, and a claimed top speed of . 0–97 km/h (60 mph) was achieved in 4.7 seconds and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds.

The first generation Exige bodywork was based on that of the Series 1 Elise, which was produced from 1996-2000, although the Elise was updated soon after the introduction of the Exige. The Exige added a non-removable hardtop, &quot;fastback&quot;, kamm-tail style rear bodywork with a tinted transparent engine cover and a pylon-mounted rear wing. Front air intakes (blanked on the road cars) and a front splitter were added. Both front and rear bodywork clamshells were widened to accept a wider wheel track. The Series 1 was built until 2001. 604 examples in total were made and the car was not replaced until the Series 2 of 2004.

=== Exige 265E ===
The Exige 265E is a factory-built version of an Exige S optimised to run on E85 fuel, which is 85% ethanol.

=== Lotus Exige Sport 350 (2015–2019), Sport 350 Roadster (2016–2019) ===
Revealed on 9 December 2015, the Lotus Exige Sport 350 is the replacement for the Exige S and the ultimate incarnation Lotus’ mid-engined V6 coupe. It is lighter and faster than the Exige S and is the next step on Lotus CEO Jean-Marc Gales&#x27; ladder to recovery for the British sports car maker. The Toyota 3.5-litre supercharged V6 underneath is unchanged, though. It still produces at 7,000rpm and at 4,500rpm. However, Lotus has been through the Exige S, stripping weight wherever possible, tweaking the chassis and generally fettling the entire package. The initial plan had been to fit the Evora’s 400 bhp engine to the Exige, but in doing so it would have meant the engineers could not get the car below the 1,200 kg target weight set by Gales. And its weight loss that has been the key focus, with 51 kg taken out of the car reducing the kerb weight to 1,125 kg. The manual gearbox has been heavily revised, giving more precise and quicker shifting. The gearshift mechanism uses light weight machined and cast aluminium components which are so technically aesthetically appealing they are no longer hidden within the transmission tunnel but exposed through an open-gate design, further reducing weight.

The Roadster variant is revealed in 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Like the coupé, the car features a carbon fibre tailgate and side intakes, and there’s also a lightweight battery and engine mounts.

===Lotus Exige Type 25 Limited Edition (2016–2021)===
The Lotus Exige Type 25 is a limited edition of just 25 units, 10 of which were right hand drive, paying tribute to Colin Chapman&#x27;s legendary single-seater Lotus 25, driven by Jim Clark in 1963. Born from the collaboration between the Lotus factory and Road Racing Center, this exclusive version was only distributed in Europe for the best lotus EU customers. Often referred to as the &quot;GT3 Touring of Exiges,&quot; it features all the body elements of the Cup and 380 Carbon Edition versions while retaining the original rear wing for a more understated look. Based on the second-generation Exige V6, it was one of the first to be delivered with the renowned open-gated gearbox. The Type 25, under the covers, is an Exige 430 Cup - the most extreme of all Exiges produced. 

The Lotus Exige Type 25 is easily recognisable by a numbered plaque located in front of the passenger seat. It also incorporates aerodynamic carbon elements from the Cup versions, particularly the side skirts, front spoiler, mirrors, and rear bumper. All units are equipped with nearly every factory option, but what truly sets them apart is a unique special livery for each model. Unlike many other Lotus Exige V6s, all body elements, including the roof, are painted. A Lotus Exclusive decal kit has been added to distinguish each model.The Type 25 would later inspire the creation of the Exige Type 49 and Type 79, based on the 430 version.

The 3.5-litre, super-charged V6 engine is now uprated and produces and of torque with a 6500 rpm red line achieved by revised supercharger and ECU. It can accelerate from 0 to in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of . The interior is also stripped out and features necessary driver aids. The Exige Sport 380 weighs , thanks to the extensive use of carbon fibre on the exterior as well as the interior, the application of polycarbonate windows instead of traditional glass windows and a newly designed rear transom panel which features two rear lights instead of four.

===Lotus Exige Cup 380 (2016–present)===
The Lotus Exige Cup 380 is a more hardcore variant of the Exige Sport 380. Performance of the car remains the same as the Sport 380 but it features more aero components and a larger rear wing to produce more downforce at high speeds. The Exige Cup 380 generates of downforce at its maximum speed of ; the top speed is reduced due to excess downforce and more drag. It features a more stripped out interior in order to save weight and other light weight carbon fibre components, Lotus states a lowest possible dry weight of only .

===Lotus Exige Cup 430 (2017–present)===

On 9 November 2017, Lotus unveiled the most powerful version of the Exige to date called the Exige Cup 430, producing and using the Evora GT430&#x27;s powertrain, modified to fit in the smaller Exige. The car body can produce of downforce. The Cup 430 is lighter than the Sport 380 due to the use of carbon fibre in body panels and interior and a titanium exhaust.

=== Lotus Exige Sport 410 (2018–2021) ===
On 4 May 2018, Lotus unveiled Exige Sport 410 to augment the current Exige lineup. It will bridge the gap between the track-focused Exige Cup 430 and road-biased Exige Sport 350. It shares much of its running gear with former, however the settings have been dialled back to establish a suitable character for both road and track driving. Mid-mounted is the 430 Cup’s, supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine. However, it has been detuned to develop and of torque. Away from the oily bits, the Exige Sport 410 is fitted with a new front end, which will be applied across the Exige range. It features enlarged air intakes and new air curtains, which improve cooling efficiency and reduce drag respectively. Further aero-based addenda, including the front splitter, rear-wing and aluminium diffuser combine to generate 150 kg of downforce. True to Lotus form, little carbon fibre has been spared to build the Exige Sport 410, so it weighs-in as the lightest V6 Exige to date at 1,054 kg (dry). Keeping the mass in check is the same suspension setup from the 430 Cup, comprising three-way adjustable nitron dampers and Eibach anti-rolls bars, at both ends.

=== Lotus Exige Sport 390, Sport 420, Cup 430 Final Edition (2021) ===

On 9 February 2021, Lotus unveiled three final editions line-up models of Exige on online platforms.

Opening the line-up is the Exige Sport 390 Final Edition. Powering the model is a 3.5-litre supercharged V6 petrol engine shared with the wider Exige range, tuned to develop and . The British brand claims a 0–100 km/h sprint time of 3.8 seconds, towards to a top speed of 276 km/h. The &#x27;entry-level&#x27; Exige tips the scales in at 1138 kg – making it the heaviest (just) of the three model variants. This advanced aerodynamic package – comprising a splitter, diffuser, and spoiler– produces 70 kg of downforce at the rear and 45 kg up front, for a total of 115 kg at top speed. Two 17-inch front and two 18-inch rear 10-spoke forged alloy wheels hide in the wheel wells, wrapped in 205/45 front and 265/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres.

Sitting above the Sport 390 is the Exige Sport 420 Final Edition. It is the fastest vehicle in the line-up in a straight line, extracting , and from its 3.5-litre supercharged V6 to complete the 0–100 km/h sprint in a claimed 3.4 seconds, and rocketing to a top speed of 290 km/h. Weighing 1110 kg, stopping power comes from AP Racing brakes, with forged four-piston callipers and two-piece J-Hook brake discs at all four corners. Adjustable Eibach anti-roll bars and three-way adjustable Nitron dampers are standard, as are 17-inch front and 18-inch lightweight forged alloy wheels wrapped in 215/45 front and 285/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber.

Sitting atop the range is the Exige Cup 430 Final Edition, which derives and from its supercharged V6 powerplant, for a claimed 0–100 km/h sprint time of 3.3 seconds. This variant picks up carbon-fibre panels on the front splitter, front access panel, roof, diffuser surround, air-intake side pods, one-piece tailgate, and rear wing – good for 171 kg of downforce at its top speed of 280 km/h. The Exige Sport 420&#x27;s suspension, tyre and brake packages carry over to the top-spec car, though the Cup 430 gains diamond-cut 17-inch front and 18-inch rear alloy wheels, a high-flow titanium sports exhaust, and a multi-mode traction control system.

The Lotus Emira was launched on 6 July 2021 and went on sale in March 2022. It replaced the Evora, Exige and Elise.

<doc id="1121762" wikidata="Q2271256" url="?curid=1121762" title="Interacting binary star">
<text>An Interacting binary star is a type of binary star in which one or both of the component stars has filled or exceeded its Roche lobe, also known as a semidetached binary. When this happens, material from one star (the donor star) will flow towards the other star (the accretor). If the accretor is a compact star, an accretion disk may form. The physical conditions in such a system can be complex and highly variable, and they are common sources of cataclysmic outbursts.

A common type of interacting binary star is one in which one of the components is a compact object which is well within its Roche lobe, while the other is an evolved giant star. If the compact object is a white dwarf, then accretion of material from the evolved star onto the white dwarf&#x27;s surface may result in its mass increasing to beyond the Chandrasekhar limit. This can lead to runaway thermonuclear reactions and the massive explosion of the star in a Type I supernova.

An example of such a binary star is R Canis Majoris, in which it is thought that the secondary star has exceeded its Roche lobe and transferred mass to the primary star. This has resulted in the early evolution of the secondary star onto the subgiant star branch, and in exposure of helium-rich material on the surface of the primary, causing it to burn brighter and have a higher effective temperature than would usually be expected for a star of its mass.

In close binary systems where the first Roche lobe overflow of the primary occurs prior to helium flash, the shedding of mass can leave behind a helium white dwarf with a mass as low as . The same scenario works when the companion is a millisecond pulsar. Evolutionary models of binaries suggest that a majority of such closely orbiting white dwarf companions will be helium–based.

<doc id="1121766" wikidata="Q1141054" url="?curid=1121766" title="Irregular variable">
<text>An irregular variable is a type of variable star in which variations in brightness show no regular periodicity. There are two main sub-types of irregular variable: eruptive and pulsating.

Eruptive irregular variables are divided into three categories:

* Group I variables are split into subgroups IA (spectral types O to A) and IB (spectral types F through M).
* Orion variables, GCVS type IN (irregular and nebulous), indigenous to star-forming regions, may vary by several magnitudes with rapid changes of up to 1 magnitude in 1 to 10 days, are similarly divided by spectral type into subgroups INA and INB, but with the addition of another subgroup, INT, for T Tauri stars, or INT(YY) for YY Orionis stars.
* The third category of eruptive irregulars are the IS stars, which show rapid variations of 0.5 to 1 magnitude in a few hours or days; again, these come in subgroups ISA and ISB.

Pulsating irregular giants or supergiants, called slow irregular variables, are all of late spectral types (K, M, C, or S), and classed as type L-LB for giants and LC for supergiants. How many of these are actually semi-regular variables that simply need more study, remains unclear.

<doc id="1121767" wikidata="Q563232" url="?curid=1121767" title="Geoffrey Bayldon">
<text>Albert Geoffrey Bayldon (7 January 1924 – 10 May 2017) was an English actor. After playing roles in many stage productions, including the works of William Shakespeare, he became known for portraying the title role of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Catweazle&quot; (1969–70). Bayldon&#x27;s other long-running parts include the Crowman in &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; (1979–81) and Magic Grandad in the BBC television series &quot;Watch&quot; (1995).

==Early life==
Bayldon was born 7 January 1924 in Leeds and attended Bridlington School and Hull College of Architecture. Following service in the Royal Air Force during World War II, he appeared in amateur theatricals and then trained at the Old Vic Theatre School.

==Career==
Bayldon enjoyed a substantial stage career, including work in the West End and for the RSC. He made several film appearances in the 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (as Q) (1967), the Envy segment of &quot;The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1971), the Marc Bolan/T. Rex film &quot;Born to Boogie&quot; (1972), &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976), as well as the film versions of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973) as the vicar, and &quot;Porridge&quot; (1979) as the Prison Governor.

Bayldon also appeared in several horror films; &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed&quot; for Hammer Films and &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot;, &quot;&quot;Asylum&quot;&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; for Amicus. In 2004, after many years of successful television work he appeared in the film &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot;.

He appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with a guest appearance as Organon in &quot;The Creature from the Pit&quot; (1979) opposite Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. Subsequently, he played an alternative First Doctor in two audio plays based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series by Big Finish Productions in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; series: &quot;Auld Mortality&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Storm of Angels&quot; (2005). In 1963, Bayldon had been one of the first actors offered the role of the Doctor.

Bayldon&#x27;s other television roles include, &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; (1957, 1959, 1964, 1967), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1961 and 1967), &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1963, 1968), &quot;Theatre 625&quot; (1964–1968), &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (1968, 1969), &quot;ITV Sunday Night Theatre&quot; (1970, 1972), &quot;&quot; (1976), &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; (1976), &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1980, 1983), &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot; (1985), &quot;Star Cops&quot; (1987), &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; (1987), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1989). He later took part in a number of BBC Schools programmes, where he displayed a number of otherwise unexploited talents (such as singing). In 1993, he played Simplicio in the Open University video &quot;Newton&#x27;s Revolution&quot;.

In 1986, Bayldon provided the vocals on Paul Hardcastle&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard&quot; which was also used (without the vocal) as the theme for BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Among his later television appearances were the Five game show &quot;Fort Boyard&quot; (1998–2001), &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (2004) and &quot;Casualty&quot; (2006, after previous appearances in 1991, 1997 and 2004). His final television appearances, before his retirement, were &quot;New Tricks&quot; (2007) and &quot;My Family&quot; (2010).

==Death==
Bayldon died on 10 May 2017, aged 93, from undisclosed causes. He was predeceased by his partner, actor Alan Rowe, who died in 2000.

<doc id="1121784" wikidata="Q2052495" url="?curid=1121784" title="NEC PC-100">
<text>The NEC PC-100 was a Japanese home computer available on October 13, 1983. It operated on 8086 CPU 7 MHz, 128 KB RAM, 128 KB VRAM, a Japanese language capable keyboard and a two-button mouse. It had three models and its color monitor, &quot;PC-KD651&quot;, which could either be used vertically or horizontally, had a price tag of ¥198,000. Its biggest advantage over many other computers of its time was its high graphical resolution of 720 x 512 pixels, with a selection of 16 colors out of a total palette of 512 colors on its high end &quot;model30&quot;. Its OS was MS-DOS and was also equipped with a spreadsheet program &quot;Maruchipuran&quot; (Multiplan) and a text editor &quot;JS-WORD&quot; as well as the game Lode Runner.

The development was operated by NEC Electronic Device Business Group, ASCII (Microsoft dealer in Japan) and Cybernet Kogyo, a subsidiary of Kyocera.

Far ahead of its time and too costly, PC-100 did not sell well. A complete set with the printer PC-PR201 that could print alphabet, hiragana, katakana and kanji, came to nearly ¥1 million. For comparison, the Nintendo Family Computer released in July of the same year was only ¥14,800 and the vaunted Apple Lisa 2 sold for ¥2.2 million. The cheaper PC-9801F2 also by NEC outsold it. 

* model10 (¥398,000) - a 5-inch 2D (360 KB) floppy disk drive
* model20 (¥448,000) - two 5-inch 2D floppy disk drives
* model30 (¥558,000) - two 5-inch 2D floppy disk drives

== Competition with PC-98 ==
NEC phased out the PC-100 due to reorganization of its business units rather than its technical issues.

The Electronic Device Business Group launched the PC-8001 in 1979, making NEC the biggest PC vendor in Japan. However, the Japanese personal computer industry had just begun, and it was unclear which market would grow. Other large computer manufacturers, IBM Japan and Fujitsu, had not focused on the personal computer industry yet. Hitachi and Sharp released home computers for hobbyists. Sord and Oki Electric Industry released personal computers for small-business sector.

In 1981, NEC expanded personal computer lines into three groups: NEC Home Electronics, Information Processing Business Group and Electronic Device Business Group, with each specializing in a particular series. The Electronic Device Business Group developed the PC-8801 for consumers who wanted to use it for both hobby and business. The Information Processing Business Group began developing the PC-9801 specialized for business market.

By 1983, the Japanese personal computer industry grew greatly, and its distribution network became complex. It caused the problem for NEC that each group competed to sell its own product to the same chain. Their biggest competitor was each group in the company, and they contested for the leadership. One software company&#x27;s president recalled the sales section of PC-9801 often said &quot;Down with the 88!&quot;.

The PC-100 and PC-9801F were released at the same time, and the problem surfaced. A store manager complained he couldn&#x27;t determine which salesperson to follow. In December 1983, NEC decided to consolidate personal computer business into two divisions: NEC Home Electronics to oversee the 8-bit home computer line, and Nippon Electric&#x27;s Information Processing Business Group to handle the 16-bit personal computer line. The Electronic Device Business Group passed off their personal computer business to NEC Home Electronics. NEC Home Electronics discontinued development of the PC-100, PC-6000 series, PC-6600 series and PC-8000 series, and these lines were merged into the PC-8800 series to concentrate on the home computer market.

<text>The Syracuse Far Westside is one of 26 neighborhoods recognized by the City of Syracuse, New York. Until this area joined the city in 1886 it was known as the Village of Geddes.

==History==

The Syracuse Far Westside is bounded by Erie Blvd West on the northeast, South Geddes Street on the lower east and Rowland Street on the south. The western border runs from Velasko Road in the south, to South Avery Avenue, Salisbury Road, Myrtle Street and parallel to Charles Avenue in Westvale, a section of Geddes ending at Willis Avenue just south of Onondaga Lake at the railroad tracks.

===Annexation===

In 1886 the village of Geddes was the largest community in the town of Geddes with many homes and businesses. Geddes officially became a town in 1848. &quot;It then included the west side of Syracuse to Geddes Street, which was the eastern boundary of the town.&quot;

Local residents voted to join the city because Syracuse had a paid professional police department, a paid professional fire department and the city was about to obtain an excellent water supply from Skaneateles Lake.

The village of Geddes was annexed by Syracuse on May 20, 1886. &quot;In one day, Geddes lost its town hall, town supervisor, town clerk, town justice, most town board members and three-quarters of its population.&quot; The residents in the area encouraged the annexation. Twice, entire commercial blocks along Furnace Street (now West Fayette Street) burned to the ground for lack of water and fire protection.

==Landmarks==

When the village of Geddes joined the city in 1886, Major John P. Burnet, who owned a large farm on Tipperary Hill, gave a large hill top plot of land to Syracuse now known as Burnet Park with the condition that the city spend $6,000 to build roads and plant trees in this new city park. Burnet was satisfied with the city&#x27;s efforts, and thus, in 1887, gave the city an additional plot of land, known as the &quot;Oak Grove&quot;, which is still full of oak trees, on the corner of South Avery Avenue and Whittier Avenue.

The Far Westside includes Tipperary Hill, an Irish neighborhood that is known for its upside-down traffic signal. Additionally, Burnet Park and the Rosamond Gifford Zoo are within its limits.

The St. Patrick&#x27;s Church Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. In 1825, the initial members of the parish came from different counties in Ireland to labor on the Erie Canal and established themselves in Tipperary Hill. The inaugural mass was conducted on July 31, 1870, by Rev. Hugh Shields, the parish&#x27;s first pastor, at Cool&#x27;s Hall, situated at 101 Hamilton Street, alongside the Erie Canal.

==Demographics==
44 percent of housing in the neighborhood is owner-occupied, close to the citywide average. As of the 2000 census, 6,916 people lived in the Far Westside. 91.3% were White, 8.7% other. 51.9% were female, 48.1% male. The median age was 34.2, and the median household income was $28,006. Registered voters are 38% Democrat, 28% Republican, 26% non-enrolled, and 8% percent other.

<doc id="1121788" wikidata="Q671513" url="?curid=1121788" title="Catweazle">
<text>Catweazle is a British children&#x27;s fantasy television series, starring Geoffrey Bayldon in the title role, and created by Richard Carpenter for London Weekend Television. The first series, produced and directed in 1969 by Quentin Lawrence, was screened in the UK on ITV in 1970. The second series, produced and directed in 1970 by David Reid and David Lane, was shown in 1971. Both series had thirteen episodes, most written by Carpenter, who also published a book for each series based on the scripts.

==Summary==
The premise in the first episode is that an 11th-century bumbling wizard named Catweazle (Geoffrey Bayldon) is pursued by soldiers through a wood, carrying only his magic charm and his toad familiar. He says a spell as he jumps into a pond. When he emerges from the pond he believes that he has flown from the woods; in fact he has jumped 900 years into the future.

Catweazle arrives on a farm in rural England in the year 1969 and befriends a farmer&#x27;s son, a ginger teenager named Edward Bennet, nicknamed Carrot (Robin Davies), who spends most of the rest of the series attempting to hide Catweazle from his father (Bud Tingwell) and the farmhand Sam (Neil McCarthy). Catweazle searches for a way to return to his own time while hiding in a disused water tower on abandoned Ministry of Defence land, which he calls Castle Saburac, with the toad called Touchwood (as touching wood is believed to bring good fortune). Whenever he is spotted, he uses his magic amulet to hypnotize people into forgetting that they saw him.

The second series featured a 12-part riddle that Catweazle, now in 1970, attempts to solve at the rate of one clue per episode, the solution (as he thinks) being revealed in the 13th.

A third series, which was apparently to be set on the Bennets&#x27; farm from the first series rather than the stately home of the second series, never got past the drafting stage.

Catweazle mistakes all modern technology for powerful magic (an example of Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s third law that &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;), particularly &quot;elec-trickery&quot; (electricity) and the &quot;telling bone&quot; (telephone). Often he tried spells that failed and he would sigh, &quot;Nothing works&quot;. Feeling flushed with success in the final episode, his last words were &quot;Everything works, Touchwood! Everything works!&quot;.

Both series were shot on 16mm film. The first series was mostly shot on location at Home Farm, Ripley Road, East Clandon, (near Guildford) in Surrey, England in 1969. The second was mostly filmed around the Bayford/Brickendon area of Hertfordshire in 1970 (S02E12 shows scenes of Brickendon and near Bayford station). Interior scenes were filmed at [the now defunct] Halliford Studios, Manygate Lane, near Shepperton.

Both series centred on the relationship between Catweazle and the young lad from the present day who quickly accepts Catweazle as a friend. The second series had a more farcical character than the first. In the plaster fight scene in the episode &#x27;The Enchanted King&#x27;. Cedric&#x27;s parents were slightly unhinged gentry living in their family stately home. Almost all characters seemed out of touch with reality except Cedric. In the second series, Catweazle sings/speaks to himself using the series theme tune.

Although Bayldon thought the story had run its course after two series, he still praised the second, commenting that two episodes were, in his view, below standard, but not written by Carpenter; &quot;There are two episodes I felt that with; the rest I think are lovely. I thought they were dreadful, but they were not written by Richard. They were written when we were behind&quot;.

The series won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain award for Best Children&#x27;s TV Drama Script in 1971.

==Series 1==
The series appeared on television for the first time on Sunday, 4 January 1970 in the Netherlands, broadcast by the NOS. It was originally shown in the UK between Sunday, 15 February 1970 and Sunday, 10 May 1970 at 17:30–18:00 in most regions.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Catweazle&quot; for &quot;Starburst&quot; magazine, Richard Hollis described &quot;Catweazle&quot; as &quot;an exceptionally well-made series and a worthy example of British Television fantasy&quot;. Television historians Alistair McGown and Mark Docherty wrote that &quot;&quot;Catweazle&quot; became a highly respected children&#x27;s series in its time&quot;.

==Home media==
In the 1980s, Carpenter announced that he hoped to adapt &quot;Catweazle&quot; into a feature film. However, the planned film was never produced.

Both series of &quot;Catweazle&quot; were released on VHS in 1998.

The first series was released on Region 2 DVD in the UK in May 2005, with a short reunion documentary &quot;Brothers in Magic&quot; and audio commentaries on selected episodes by Carpenter, Bayldon, Davies and Executive Producer Joy Whitby. The second series was released in August 2005.

In Australia &quot;Catweazle: The Complete Series&quot; was released in May 2007. In June 2011 both series were released in Region 4.

On 29 March 2010 the series was re-released in the UK to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Among several other additional features were a &quot;Westbourne Museum&quot; image gallery (named after a small local museum in the episode &quot;The Curse of Rapkyn&quot; starring Peter Sallis) featuring the most comprehensive collection of original Catweazle memorabilia and promotional ephemera ever assembled, sourced from The Paul Pert Screen Collection. The release of the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD set was also accompanied by a commemorative publication, &quot;The Magic Book&quot; by Simon Wells and Paul Pert. Robin Davies (who had played Carrot) died just before its publication, on 22 February 2010, at the age of 56. The publication includes an article by Pert about the longevity of the Catweazle phenomenon, entitled &quot;A Magical Spell in the Countryside,&quot; which contains Robin Davies&#x27;s last recorded comments about the series that made him a star and about his special friendship with Bayldon. The DVD image gallery also recorded the occasion of their last meeting at an annual commemorative event held at the farm in East Clandon, Surrey, where the first series was filmed in the summer of 1969.

Also featured in the article was an interview with Richard Carpenter in which he gave a frank account of his thoughts on modern television, and again expressed his desire to bring his writing career full circle with a Catweazle film for the 21st century. He also confirmed that he had drafted a new script. Negotiations for a film had reached pre-production stages when Carpenter died while walking his dog in the countryside at the age of 82 on 26 February 2012.

The first episode of the first series is available to view in full for registered users at the BFI Screenonline site.

The full series was shown on the UK free-to-air television channel Talking Pictures TV from Saturday 2 November 2019.

==Books==
There are two novelisations by Carpenter, one for each series: &quot;Catweazle&quot; and &quot;Catweazle and the Magic Zodiac&quot;. Both books were illustrated by George Adamson. A 20-page picture book, &quot;Catweazle in Marrow Escape&quot; was also produced, written by Alan Fennell. A comic strip version featured in the TV comic &quot;Look-in&quot;, written by Angus P. Allan, and three annuals were also released by World, from 1970 to 1972.

== Film == 
A German film adaptation of the series was released in June 2021, featuring German comedian Otto Waalkes as Catweazle. The film was mostly shot on location at Eberbach Abbey and Stolberg (&quot;Kupferhof Rosenthal&quot;, &quot;primary school Grüntalstraße&quot;, &quot;Oldtown&quot;) and the &quot;Katzensteine&quot; between Mechernich and &quot;Satzvey Castle&quot;.

==Legacy==

English professional wrestler Gary Cooper (1939-1992) adopted the ring name &quot;Catweazle&quot; and similar image to the title character of the programme. Signed to Joint Promotions, he appeared regularly on the wrestling slot of &quot;World of Sport&quot;, including Mick McManus&#x27; retirement match in 1982.

<doc id="1121819" wikidata="Q739749" url="?curid=1121819" title="Kathryn Kuhlman">
<text>Kathryn Kuhlman (May 9, 1907 – February 20, 1976) was an American Christian evangelist, preacher and minister who was referred to by her contemporaries and the press as a &#x27;faith healer&#x27;.

==Early life==
Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born in 1907 near Concordia, Missouri, where her father was mayor. She was one of four children of German-American parents Joseph Adolph Kuhlman and Emma Walkenhorst. Kuhlman received Bible instruction at home from her parents, who were both Methodist. 

Kuhlman had a spiritual experience at age 14, and several years later she began itinerant preaching with her elder sister and brother-in-law in Idaho. Later, she was ordained by the Evangelical Church Alliance.

Amanda H. Williams of Brooklyn, New York helped birth Kuhlman&#x27;s healing ministry.

==Ministry==
Kuhlman traveled extensively around the United States and abroad holding healing meetings between the 1940s and 1970s. She was considered to be one of the most well-known faith healers in the world; however, the term &quot;faith healer&quot; was something she rejected as offensive. In 1955, despite being told by doctors about a heart condition in her late 40s, Kuhlman kept a very busy schedule, often traveling across the US and abroad, holding two to six-hour long meetings which could last late into the evenings.

Kuhlman had a weekly TV program in the 1960s and 1970s called &quot;I Believe In Miracles&quot;, which aired nationally. She also had a 30-minute nationwide radio program, which featured sermons and frequent excerpts from her healing services in music and message. Her foundation was established in 1954, and its Canadian branch in 1970. Late in her life she was supportive of the nascent Jesus movement.

By 1970 she had moved to Los Angeles, conducting healing services for thousands of people, and was often compared to Aimee Semple McPherson. She became well known for her &quot;gift of healing&quot; despite, as she often noted, having no theological training. She was friendly with Christian television evangelist Pat Robertson and made guest appearances at his Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) and on the network&#x27;s flagship program &quot;The 700 Club&quot;.

In 1975, Kuhlman was sued by Paul Bartholomew, her personal administrator, who claimed that she kept $1 million in jewelry and $1 million in fine art hidden away and sued her for $430,500 for breach of contract. Two former associates accused her in the lawsuit of diverting funds and of illegally removing records, which she denied and said the records were not private. According to Kuhlman, the lawsuit was settled prior to trial.

Kuhlman&#x27;s devotion to her ministry was summed up in the 1976 biography &quot;Daughter of Destiny&quot;, written by Jamie Buckingham:&quot;The television ministry itself required more than $30,000 a week. To stop, to even cut back, would mean she was beginning to fail. The same was true with the miracle services. As the pain in her chest grew almost unbearable, instead of holding fewer services, she increased the number.&quot;

=== Healing ===
An estimated two million people reported that they were healed in her meetings over the years.

Following a 1967 fellowship in Philadelphia, Dr. William A. Nolen conducted a case study of 23 people who said they had been cured during one of her services. Nolen&#x27;s long term follow-ups concluded that there were no cures in those cases. One woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman&#x27;s command; her spine collapsed the next day and she died four months later.

Nolen&#x27;s analysis of Kulhman came in for criticism from believers. Lawrence Althouse, a physician, said that Nolen had attended only one of Kuhlman&#x27;s services and did not follow up with all of those who said they had been healed there. Dr. Richard Casdorph produced a book of evidence in support of miraculous healings by Kuhlman. Hendrik van der Breggen, a Christian philosophy professor, argued in favor of the claims. Author Craig Keener concluded, &quot;No one claims that everyone was healed, but it is also difficult to dispute that significant recoveries occurred, apparently in conjunction with prayer. One may associate these with Kathryn Kuhlman&#x27;s faith or that of the supplicants, or, as in some of Kuhlman&#x27;s teaching, to no one&#x27;s faith at all; but the evidence suggests that some people were healed, even in extraordinary ways.&quot;. Dr. Richard Owellen, a member of the cancer‐research department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who appeared frequently at Kuhlman&#x27;s services, testified to various healings that he said he had investigated.

== Personal life ==
Kuhlman met Texas evangelist Burroughs Waltrip in 1935, when he was a guest speaker at Kuhlman&#x27;s Denver Revival Tabernacle, and the two preachers soon found themselves in a romantic relationship with each other. Eventually, Waltrip divorced his first wife, left his family, moved to Mason City, Iowa, and started a revival center called Radio Chapel, Kuhlman and her pianist friend, Helen Gulliford, helped him raise funds for this new venture.

After a romance between Waltrip and Kuhlman began, she told her friends that she could not &quot;find the will of God in the matter&quot;, seemingly feeling guilt-ridden. Kuhlman&#x27;s friends tried to encourage her to not marry Waltrip. However, she reasoned that Waltrip&#x27;s wife had left him, not the other way around. (The details of their separation are not clear.) On October 18, 1938, she secretly married &quot;Mister,&quot; as she called him, in Mason City, but the wedding supposedly brought her no peace. The couple had no children and eventually separated in 1944, divorcing in 1948.

Regarding her marriage, in a 1952 interview with the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, Kuhlman stated, &quot;He charged—correctly—that I refused to live with him. And I haven&#x27;t seen him in eight years.&quot; On many occasions, Kuhlman expressed remorse for her part in the pain caused by the breakup of Waltrip&#x27;s previous marriage, citing his children&#x27;s heartbreak as particularly troubling to her. She claimed it was the single greatest regret of her life, second only to the betrayal of her loving relationship with Jesus.

==Death==
In July 1975, a doctor diagnosed Kuhlman with a minor heart flare-up; in November, she had a relapse. As a result, Kuhlman underwent open-heart surgery in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during which she died on February 20, 1976. It was reported in her biography that at the time of her passing in the hospital, a bright light was witnessed hovering over her corpse.

Kathryn Kuhlman was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. A plaque in her honor is in the main city park in Concordia, Missouri, a town in central Missouri on Interstate Highway 70.

After she died, her will led to controversy. She left $267,500, the bulk of her estate, to three members of her family and twenty of her employees. Smaller bequests were given to 19 other employees. According to the &quot;Independent Press-Telegram&quot;, her employees were disappointed when they learned that &quot;she did not leave most of her estate to the foundation as she had done under a previous 1974 will.&quot;

The Kathryn Kuhlman Foundation continued, but due to lack of funding, it terminated its nationwide radio broadcast in 1982. Ultimately, the foundation closed its doors in April 2016.

==Legacy==
Many believers uphold Kuhlman as an important forerunner to the present-day charismatic movement. She influenced faith healers Benny Hinn and Billy Burke. Hinn has adopted some of her techniques and he also wrote a book about Kuhlman, as he frequently attended her preaching services. Burke did meet her and was counseled by her, having claimed a miracle healing in her service as a young boy.

In 1981, David Byrne and Brian Eno sampled one of Kuhlman&#x27;s sermons for a track which they created during sessions for their collaborative album &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;. After failing to clear the license to Kuhlman&#x27;s voice from her estate, the track was reworked to use audio from an unidentified exorcism, with this modified version being released as &quot;The Jezebel Spirit&quot;. The Kuhlman version was later included on the 1992 bootleg recording &quot;Ghosts&quot;, titled &quot;Into the Spirit Womb&quot;.

<text>Maria Piłsudska (née Koplewska; 1865 – 17 August 1921), was a Polish socialist and independence activist, the first wife of Poland&#x27;s Chief of State Józef Piłsudski and ostensibly the first lady of Poland during most of his service as Poland&#x27;s Chief of State.

== Life ==
 She was born in 1865 in Vilnius, at that time part of the Russian Empire, to Konstanty Koplewski, a prominent physician. After graduating from high school, she moved to St. Petersburg, Russia. There she studied in the Bestuzhev Courses, a university for women, while cultivating friendships within certain revolutionary circles. It was there she met Marian Juszkiewicz, a young railway engineer whom she married in 1883. Their marriage was not a happy one, however, and fell apart soon after the birth of their daughter, Wanda, in 1887.

In 1892, the beautiful, intelligent and socially poised Maria met Józef Piłsudski. After seven years, they married on 15 July 1899 at the village of Paproć Duża near Łomża. Since Maria was a divorcee and the Catholic Church did not recognize divorce, she and Piłsudski had converted to Protestantism. Soon afterward they settled in Łódź, where Józef continued his revolutionary activities. In February 1900, they were arrested when a clandestine printing press was discovered in their apartment. After eleven months Maria was released, while Piłsudski remained imprisoned in the infamous Tenth Pavilion at the Warsaw Citadel in the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Upon his subsequent escape from a mental hospital in St. Petersburg to which he had been transferred, the couple moved to Lwów, in eastern Galicia in Austria-Hungary.

In mid-November 1901, they relocated to London, the seat of the Polish Socialist Party&#x27;s leadership. In April 1902, however, pursuant to the needs of the PPS, they returned to Lwów, and in 1904 moved to Kraków.

In May 1906 Piłsudski met Aleksandra Szczerbińska, who was working with the PPS paramilitary organization. After a time, Piłsudski and Aleksandra began an affair. In 1908 Maria Piłsudska&#x27;s daughter by her first marriage, Wanda, died. By 1909, Maria was aware of Józef&#x27;s affair but refused to divorce him, and they continued to share a home until the outbreak of the First World War. Maria remained popular among the PPS and its paramilitary faction, and had helped Józef gain adherents amongst them. Their marriage continued to deteriorate, however, and after his release from Magdeburg Prison in November 1918, Piłsudski abandoned her. Aleksandra Szczerbińska became his de facto wife, although for propriety&#x27;s sake they had to maintain separate homes. Maria Piłsudska withdrew from public life and continued to reside in Kraków.

Maria Piłsudska died in Kraków on 17 August 1921. She was buried at the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius. Piłsudski did not attend the funeral; two months later he married Aleksandra, by whom he had had a daughter, Wanda, in 1918, and a second daughter, Jadwiga, in 1920.

<text>Walcha () is a town at the south-eastern edge of the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia.

The town serves as the seat of Walcha Shire. Walcha is located by road from Sydney at the intersection of the Oxley Highway and Thunderbolts Way. The Apsley River passes through the town to tumble over the Apsley Falls before joining the Macleay River further on. Originally the river caused flooding in the town prior to a levee bank being constructed and saving the town from more floods. At the 2021 census, Walcha had a population of 1369 people.

The Main North railway line is located west at a separate village called Walcha Road which serves as the railhead. This is served by the daily NSW TrainLink Xplorer service between Sydney and Armidale. The railway line was built at Walcha Road, because it was the closest point they could get to the town, due to the steep climb over the Great Dividing Range.

==History==
The area was occupied by the Dhanggati (or Dunghutti) People for 6000 years prior to European settlement. The tablelands had places for ceremonies and trade of goods, and there are traces of bora grounds near Walcha. In the colder months, tribes retreated to the gorge country to the east, where fish and animals were plentiful. 

In 1818, John Oxley was the first European person to explore the area and the falls which were later to be named Apsley Falls.

Hamilton Collins Sempill was the first settler in the New England area when he took up the &#x27;Wolka&#x27; run in 1832, establishing slab huts where &#x27;Langford&#x27; now stands. Other early runs around the district were Bergen-op-Zoom (1834), Ohio (1836), Europambela (c.1836), Surveyor’s Creek (1836), Emu Creek (c.1837), Ingalba (1837), Orandumbie (1837), Tiara (1837) and Winterbourne (1837). A severe depression from 1841 to 1843, and low demand for wool created hardship for many of these early settlers. In 1848 Walcha run is recorded as being and in the lease of David Lanarch. During 1854 Walcha was sold to Rundle and Dangar who held the mortgage for Jamison and Connal. Later John Fletcher acquired Walcha and moved from Branga Plains to Oorundumby. After being sold in 1905, Oorundumby was resumed for soldier settlement in 1947 and subdivided into 22 holdings.

Not long after Sempill&#x27;s arrival, in 1834, John McLean took up a run he called Bergen op Zoom, reportedly named in tribute to relatives Allen and Francis McLean, who had assisted the Dutch in the defence of that town against the French in the War of the Sixth Coalition. When McLean died in 1851, his family sold Bergen Op Zoom to Shropshire-born artist Edward Baker-Boulton, who with his brothers already owned extensive runs in the Wellington district. Baker-Boulton was typical of the absentee owners of large stations, living for the most part in Sydney or &#x27;back home&#x27; in the UK, the station being run as a partnership with David Bell, until 1874 when Bell left to take over management of his own holdings in the district. Baker-Boulton then returned from England to manage the station hands-on, and died there, aged 83, in 1895, where he is buried in the Walcha Cemetery. He was a noted artist of the early Colonial period whose works are largely forgotten now. Edith, the eldest daughter of his second wife, Rachel Gwyn, who visited Walcha in 1890, was the mother of renowned English children&#x27;s author, Arthur Ransome, whose bucolic &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series is still in print in the 21st century. The sixth book in the series, &quot;Pigeon Post&quot;, was the inaugural winner of the Carnegie Medal in 1936.

A &quot;wool&quot; road to Port Macquarie (the Oxley Highway) was under construction in 1842 for the transportation of wool from New England to the coast. Walcha Post Office opened on 1 July 1850. The mail arrived from Macdonald River (now Bendemeer). Walcha was gazetted as a village site in 1852, when town allotments were sold, with annual sales following. At that time there was a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a general store and a flour mill. A Roman Catholic chapel was erected in 1854, a police station and the first Presbyterian church was built in 1857 and the Walcha Central School in 1859.

In 1861 the population was recorded at 355 and the Anglican church was built in 1862 of stone taken from the demolished homestead, &#x27;Villa Walcha&#x27;, erected on the Wolka run in the 1840s. The old church has fine stained-glass windows which bear tribute to some of the town&#x27;s pioneers.

The population dropped in the 1860s but the town soon began to grow for two reasons: firstly, red cedar getters were active in the area&#x27;s rainforests by about 1870. Gold was discovered near Walcha in the 1870s at Glen Morrison, Tia, The Cells River and Nowendoc. Antimony, copper, graphite, manganese, silver and high quality slate was also mined in the district.

On 5 April 1878 Walcha was proclaimed a town, when it was gazetted, the boundaries defined and a courthouse was built. A rail link to Sydney, Tamworth, Woolbrook and Uralla opened at Walcha Road in 1882. The town became a municipality in 1889. On 19 March 1890 the Walcha Pastoral &amp; Agricultural Association was formed. This annual show has excellent exhibits of livestock, produce, vegetables, flowers, wool and handicrafts. Walcha Cottage Hospital founded in 1890 and was situated on the southern hill in South Street. The Shire of Apsley was constituted by proclamation on 7 March 1906. It is in the counties of Vernon, Hawes, and Inglis and comprises about 60 parishes. The area is . The Shire of Walcha was constituted by the Union of the Municipality and the Shire of Apsley as from on 1 June 1955.

Other district villages are: Niangala, Nowendoc, Woolbrook, Brackendale, Glen Morrison, Ingalba, Tia and Yarrowitch.

History was made at Walcha in 1950 when a Tiger Moth was the first aircraft used to spread superphosphate by air in Australia. The &quot;super&quot; was dropped on &quot;Mirani&quot; and other landholders soon followed suit to greatly increase the livestock carrying capacity of the district.

In 1992 the Walcha Telecottage was established to become the first telecentre established in Australia. The Telecottage is a not for profit community with the latest information communication facilities, in order to activate interactions between the local communities and to create employment opportunities. This Telecottage carries out not only the fundamental types of work such as job training, remote education, secretarial service and data analysis, but also Internet access service for individuals and small companies. Walcha Telecottage produces a weekly community newsletter, the Apsley Advocate, which is free and delivered to over 1,600 commercial and private addresses.

<text>USS &quot;S-34&quot; (SS-139) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-34&quot; was laid down on 28 May 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 13 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Florence Hellman, and commissioned on 12 July 1922.

==Service history==

Following commissioning, &quot;S-34&quot; was ordered to New London, Connecticut, for engineering alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company. Decommissioned on 25 October 1922, she was delivered to the company which completed the work in the spring of 1923. The submarine was recommissioned on 23 April; and, after further trials and various exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea, she returned to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego, California, her home port, on 6 August. For the next year and one-half, she remained based in southern California, then, in 1925, she was ordered to the Philippines. She departed from San Francisco, California, in mid-April, arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, P.I., on 12 July; and, after voyage repairs and an overhaul, commenced operations as a unit of the Asiatic Fleet. From then until 1932, she rotated between exercises, patrols, and overhauls in the Philippines during the winter and deployments to the China coast in the summer for operations out of Tsingtao. In 1932, she was ordered back to the eastern Pacific Ocean. She departed Manila on 2 May and headed for Pearl Harbor, whence she operated until April 1941. She then returned to San Diego.

During the remaining months of peace, &quot;S-34&quot; provided services for the West Coast Sound School. With the attack on Pearl Harbor, defensive patrol work off the West Coast was added to her duties. However, with the new year, 1942, she and other World War I design submarines were ordered prepared for service in the northern Pacific in defense of the Aleutian Islands. She underwent overhaul at Mare Island, and, in March, she moved north to the newly established submarine base at Dutch Harbor, Unalaska. On 12 April, she headed west on her first war patrol.

===First war patrol===
One day out, a heavy wave threw the quartermaster of the watch against the side of the bridge, and &quot;S-34&quot; was forced to return to base to put the badly injured man ashore. Arriving on 14 April, she cleared the harbor again the same day and resumed her westward passage. On 15 April, engineering casualties and poor weather slowed her progress. The next day, the weather moderated, but intensified again on 18 April. On 20 April, she left the Bering Sea and entered the less violent, but fog shrouded, waters of the Kuril Islands. Two days later, off the entrance to Onekotan Strait she attacked her first enemy target, but failed to score.

The next day, &quot;S-34&quot; moved into the Sea of Okhotsk to take up her assigned station west of Paramushiro. Ice, two to five feet above the water, still covered the area and the boat retired through the strait to patrol on the Pacific side of the island.

24 April brought another unsuccessful attack on a merchantman and an attempt to close a warship. Two days later, the lookouts observed increased activity by enemy patrol planes. On 27 April, the S-boat again attempted to penetrate the ice, via Mushiru Strait. The same day, she returned to the Pacific; and, on 28 April she headed back to the Aleutians.

She encountered mountainous seas in the Bering Sea; but by 1 May, she was at Attu Island. Thence, she continued on to Kiska; remained offshore on 2 May as a storm battered the island; and, on 3 May, she replenished and moved north to intercept any enemy submarines which might be heading for the Gulf of Alaska. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

Refit as intelligence estimates predicting a Japanese thrust at Midway Island and the Aleutians were received, &quot;S-34&quot; cleared Dutch Harbor on 28 May and stood west to patrol north of Attu. On 29 May, the Japanese Aleutian force sortied from Ominato and headed east, its approach to its target covered by fog and rain. On the morning of 3 June, Japanese planes bombed Dutch Harbor.

===Second war patrol===

From the start of her patrol until 11 June, &quot;S-34&quot; remained in her assigned area, listening to reports, but sighting no enemy ships. On 11 June, she received news of the Japanese occupation of Kiska and orders to take &quot;maximum offensive action.&quot; She headed for Kiska.

Diverted back to Dutch Harbor, she replenished on 12 June and got underway again the same day, but returned to Attu instead of going to Kiska. She reconnoitered Sarana Bay, Holtz Bay, and Chichagof Harbor; none showed any activity. On 17 June, she sighted a warship off the Semichi Islands, but could not close the range. She then returned to Attu and, on 20 June, sighted an enemy destroyer patrolling off Sarana Bay. Between 07:00 and 10:00, she sighted and lost the target twice as it moved in and out of the fog.

At 11:55, she sighted a large tanker inside the bay. Fifty minutes later, she slipped past a destroyer guarding the entrance and began maneuvering into the bay. Her target was engaged in refueling another destroyer. At 13:50, &quot;S-34&quot; grounded at a depth of 48 feet. Run up to 25 feet, she came out of the water to the waterline; then backed off into deep water. Within five minutes, she was operating at periscope depth. The fueling destroyer had gotten underway from alongside the tanker and was racing across the intervening waters. &quot;S-34&quot; fired two torpedoes at the destroyer, forcing the enemy to swerve and pass down the submarine&#x27;s port side. Unable then to bring her tubes to bear on the tanker, the S-boat swung right to avoid depth charges. At 14:03, she bottomed in 164 feet, just inside the entrance to the bay, where she remained until 23:30.

During that time, only one destroyer was heard searching for her, the other, which had conducted the high speed attack, was heard pinging from the same spot for nine hours. She had presumably grounded after the attack, but, by 23:00, the tide had risen and she had moved to join in the search for the submarine.

At 23:30, &quot;S-34&quot; began to make her way out of the bay. Twenty minutes later, one of the destroyers located her. The pace of the hunt was stepped up, but the quarry evaded attempts to destroy her. By 02:30 on 21 June, she had maneuvered out of the bay, lost her pursuer; and set a course for Dutch Harbor. On 26 June, &quot;S-34&quot; moored in Dutch Harbor, whence she proceeded to Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul and training duty.

===Third war patrol===

On 13 September, she returned to Unalaska, and, on 14 September, she departed from Dutch Harbor on her third war patrol. Two days later, she crossed the 180th meridian; and, on 17 September, she arrived in the Semichi area and commenced crossing the Japanese supply lanes to the western Aleutians in search of targets. On 20 September, while off Buldir, her after radio mast was partially carried away by heavy seas and threatened to foul the propellers and stern planes. Despite the heavy seas, Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate B.F. Allen went over the side; cut the wreckage adrift and rigged two forward wing antennas.

On 21 September, the submarine resumed her patrol off Attu, reconnoitering the approaches to its harbors. On 26 September, she was ordered to Kiska, and, on the afternoon of 28 September, she sighted a minelayer off Kiska Harbor. The enemy, however, detected her presence before she could close the target. Destroyers joined the minelayer, and &quot;S-34&quot; once again became the hunted. Forty minutes and 47 depth charges later, she cleared the immediate area. A week later, she sighted and closed a Kiska-bound enemy submarine; but, as the torpedoes were readied, depth control was lost; and she failed to score. On 8 October, she headed home, arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 October.

===Fourth war patrol===

Storms and heavy seas abounded in the western Aleutians during &quot;S-34&quot;’s fourth war patrol, 23 October to 21 November. Operating in and across the Japanese traffic routes from Kiska to Agattu and Attu and between Paramushiro and Attu, she sighted only one possible target, a submarine which disappeared before identification could be made.

===Fifth war patrol===

She got underway for her fifth war patrol on 5 December. On 9 December, she resumed operations to intercept Japanese shipping between the Kurils and the Aleutians. Twenty days later, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

===Overhaul===

In early January 1943, the S-boat sailed south. On 18 January, she arrived at San Diego where she remained until late April, undergoing overhaul; receiving radar, air conditioning, and improved communication and navigation equipment, and providing services to the West Coast Sound School. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor; and, on 13 May, she departed from that base to patrol again in the Kurils.

===Sixth war patrol===

By 22 May, &quot;S-34&quot; was off Paramushiro and, for the next 12 days, she patrolled in the southern approaches to the island, and in Shumushu and Paramushiro strait. On the evening of 31 May 1943, she mistakenly torpedoed and sank the Soviet 2,600-gross register ton survey ship &quot;Chukcha&quot; off Torishimo Retto. On the evening of 3 June, she cleared the area.

===Seventh war patrol===

Arriving back at Dutch Harbor on 10 June, she departed again 11 days later. On 28 June, she approached the fog-bound Kurils; and, on 1 July, she moved toward the Kamchatka Peninsula to locate and destroy enemy fishing vessels operating near and north of Cape Lopatka. On 3 July, while she was charging, fire broke out in the port motor, but was quickly extinguished. Repairs were completed on 5 July; and, on 7 July, she moved into a new area, Onekotan Island. The next day, she returned to Paramushiro. On 13 July, she sighted two ships and commenced closing the targets despite poor visibility. Shortly after noon, she launched three torpedoes, but her crew heard only thuds as they struck the target. On 15 July, she moved back into Paramushiro Strait and, on 22 July set a course for Unalaska.

==Retirement==
Arriving on 30 July, she moved south in early August and, at mid-month, arrived at San Diego where she provided training services through the end of World War II. Then ordered inactivated, she proceeded to San Francisco where she was decommissioned on 23 October 1945. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the following month, and her hulk was sold for scrapping in 1946.

<doc id="1121847" wikidata="Q459819" url="?curid=1121847" title="Dehomag">
<text>Dehomag was a German subsidiary of IBM and later a standalone company with a monopoly in the German market before and during World War II. The word was a syllabic abbreviation for Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen GmbH (). &quot;Hollerith&quot; refers to the German-American inventor of the technology of punched cards, Herman Hollerith. In April 1949 the company name was changed to IBM Deutschland.

==Background==

The technology of punched cards dates back to the 18th century when it was used for mass production of woven textiles and later used as a recording and playback system in player pianos. The use of punched cards for recording and tabulating data was first proposed and used by Semyon Korsakov around 1805. In 1832 Charles Babbage proposed using similar cards to program and to store computations for his calculating engine. Punched card technology was further developed for data-processing by Herman Hollerith from the 1880s. It was used for the 1890 United States census and for the census work of several foreign governments.

==History==
Willy Heidinger, an acquaintance of Hollerith, licensed all of Hollerith&#x27;s The Tabulating Machine Company patents in 1910, and created Dehomag in Germany. In 1911 The Tabulating Machine Company was amalgamated (via stock acquisition) with three others, creating a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). In 1923 CTR acquired 90% ownership of Dehomag, thus acquiring patents developed by them. In 1924 CTR was renamed IBM.

==Holocaust==
As an IBM subsidiary, Dehomag became the main provider of computing expertise and equipment in Nazi Germany. Dehomag gave the German government the means for two official censuses of the population after 1933 and for searching its data. Nazi government used the tabulating machines that Dehomag received before violent events like Kristallnacht for tracing Jews and dissidents. It enabled them to search databases rapidly and efficiently, and the methods were used throughout occupied Europe by the Gestapo and others to locate and arrest its victims, contributing to the Holocaust.

Dehomag leased and maintained the German government&#x27;s punched card machines. Before World War II, Dehomag&#x27;s general manager for Germany, Hermann Rottke, reported directly to IBM President Thomas J. Watson in New York. It was legal for companies in United States to conduct business with Germany directly until the country entered the war in December 1941. Watson had received Order of the German Eagle medal at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, but after Nazis&#x27; pogroms against Jews started in 1938 Watson himself wanted to distance himself and IBM from Germans but was convinced not to do so by Secretary of State Hull and he gave up the idea until spring of 1940.

IBM New York established a special subsidiary in the occupied General Government territory, Watson Business Machines, to deal with railway traffic there during the Holocaust in Poland. The German Transport Ministry used IBM machines under the New York-controlled subsidiary in Warsaw, not the German subsidiary. Watson Business Machines operated a punch card printing shop near the Warsaw Ghetto. The punch cards bore the indicia of the German subsidiary Dehomag.

Leon Krzemieniecki, the last surviving person involved in the administration of the rail transportation to Auschwitz and Treblinka, stated he knew the punched card machines were not German machines, because the labels were in English. Income from the machines leased in General Government was sent through Geneva to IBM in New York.

<text>Loyalist College (formally Loyalist College of Applied Arts and Technology) is an English-language college in Belleville, Ontario, Canada that is partnered with private Toronto Business College.

== History ==
Prior to the 1960s, only trade schools co-existed with universities in the province of Ontario at the post-secondary level, most of which had been established primarily to help veterans reintegrate into society in the post-war years. Loyalist College was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create many such institutions to provide career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities. The name of the college reflects the area&#x27;s original settlement by United Empire Loyalists.

Originally operated out of a local high school, Loyalist College moved to its present campus on Wallbridge-Loyalist Road in 1968. The college operates a satellite campus in Bancroft, Ontario and is associated with First Nations Technical Institute in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory reserve.

The college provides education to local Canadians that are native to Belleville or neighboring towns, but many of the students at Loyalist College also come from South Asian countries as immigrants on international visas.

== Athletics ==

Loyalist&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams use the name &quot;Lancers&quot;. The school colours are royal blue and scarlet.

===Current athletic teams===
*Men&#x27;s Volleyball
*Women&#x27;s Volleyball
*Men&#x27;s Basketball
*Women&#x27;s Basketball
*Men&#x27;s Rugby
*Women’s Rugby 7s
*Women&#x27;s Soccer
*Cross-country

== Residence ==

Loyalist College houses some of its students in the Loyalist College Residence located on the college campus. The residence contains five buildings and holds approximately 474 students.

<doc id="1121856" wikidata="Q214978" url="?curid=1121856" title="Club Atlético Independiente">
<text> () is an Argentine professional sports club, which has its headquarters and stadium in Avellaneda, a city of the Buenos Aires Province. The club is best known for its football team, which plays in the Primera División and is considered one of Argentina&#x27;s &quot;Big Five&quot; football clubs.

Independiente was officially founded on 1 January 1904 as Independiente Foot-Ball Club, although the institution had been formed on 4 August 1904. Originally from Monserrat, a neighbourhood of Buenos Aires city, the club moved to Crucecita in 1907 and then to Avellaneda in 1928. The football team achieved promotion to the Argentine Primera División for the first time in 1911, and has participated there ever since, except for the 2013–14 season, when they were relegated.

Inaugurated in 2009, the Estadio Libertadores de América serves as homeground for the men&#x27;s football team and, on special occasions, for the women&#x27;s team. It has a capacity of 49,500. Their fanbase is the third largest in the country.

Over time Independiente has won 16 Primera División titles (14 of them in the professional era) and 9 first-tier and one second-tier National cups, being the fourth most decorated club in the national stage. They also have the most victories at the Avellaneda derby, the second most important derby in the country behind the Superclásico.

Despite the national success, Independiente is mainly recognized for its continental titles, having won a record seven Copa Libertadores (1964, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1984, including a four-title-in-a-row record), two Intercontinental Cups (1973 v. Juventus in Rome and 1984 v. Liverpool in Tokyo), two Copa Sudamericana (2010 and 2017) and the 1995 Recopa Sudamericana.

They also achieved now defunct competitions such as two Copa Aldao, a record three Copa Interamericana, two Supercopa Libertadores and the 2018 Suruga Bank Championship. Over time these achievements made Independiente win the nicknames of &quot;Rey de Copas&quot; (King of Cups) and &quot;Orgullo Nacional&quot; (National Pride), the latter after the team won, at the 1984 Intercontinental, the first encounter between an Argentine and British teams after the Falklands War. With 18 FIFA-recognized international titles, Independiente is the most successful club at this category in the Americas, alongside Boca Juniors, and third in the world.

Apart from football, other activities practised at the club are athletics, basketball, boxing, chess, field hockey, futsal, handball, gymnastics, martial arts, Pilates, roller skating, scuba diving, swimming, tennis, volleyball, water polo, and yoga.
Also, the club has its own school, with Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten, Elementary, Secondary school levels and Tertiary education (with, for now, only two careers, being physical education teacher and football coach).

== History ==
=== Early years in Buenos Aires ===
Independiente was founded in 1904 by a group of employees from a luxury fashion store called &quot;A la Ciudad de Londres&quot; (To the City of London), located in the Montserrat neighborhood of the City of Buenos Aires. These employees, the youngest and most affected by precarious work in the store, despite paying the club fee, were marginalized from the 1903-founded team Maipo-Banfield Football Club (made up of the store&#x27;s most elite workers). They were only allowed to attend as spectators.

On 4 August of that year, they met in a bar on Perú Street (just two blocks from the Plaza de Mayo and the Casa Rosada), there they made the decision to reject an invitation to be part of Atlanta (also founded those days) and proclaimed the creation of the &quot;Independiente Foot-Ball Club&quot;, symbolizing their independence ideals. Rosendo Degiorgi was the one who gave the club its name and was elected as its first president, opening the club&#x27;s headquarters in his own house. The team&#x27;s first shirts were white, reused from a Barracas team called Plate United, which ceased to exist in 1903. These shirts featured a blue emblem with white details, very similar to St. Andrew&#x27;s Athletic Club&#x27;s emblem. It is unknown whether this similarity was intentional or coincidental.

Fifteen days after the first meeting, on 19 August, they played the first game in their history, a 2–2 tie with Atlanta, on a field located in the Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires.

During its short stay in the Argentine capital, Independiente wandered in various improvised fields in the neighborhoods of Flores and La Paternal. They also acted as hosts in Recoleta, where they rented a very expensive field belonging to the National School of Buenos Aires for five months.

The club competed in 1905 in zonal tournaments like the Villalobos Cup, where they faced for the first time to Boca Juniors (created just four months before) on 27 August, being victorious 4–1 in Flores.

The club joined the AFA in 1906 and was registered to begin competing that year, like neighbors Atlanta, but was disqualified at the last moments for not complying with the strict stadium rules demanded by the then English-directed AFA, therefore that they registered to compete in the Central Football League. At this championship they faced short-lived teams like Highland Forest, Gutemberg, Presidente Roca, Imperio, Mariano Moreno, General Arenales, La Prensa, Primero de Mayo and others. Among them, the only team that survived over that time is Platense.

=== Crucecita period ===

While the team competed at the Central League, a committee composed by club president Arístides Langone and secretaries Carlos Degiorgi, Antonio Díez, Severo Rodríguez and Juan Darnay was seeking to relocate the club at a new field where they could build a stadium. By recommendation from Juan Irigoyen (secretary and player) they found an available field in Crucecita East, near Dock Sud. Consequently, they began playing the Central League in Buenos Aires and finished it in Crucecita (Avellaneda suburb).

In 1907 they left the local tournaments being champions of the CFL summer tournament, ahead of Platense, as that year they were finally accepted to compete in AFA. They were about to be rejected again as the field still didn&#x27;t comply with all the strict requirements, but they made it by insistence from Carlos Degiorgi.

Starting from the Second Division, their first official match in the AFA leagues was a 1–3 defeat to Comercio in Crucecita. In June of that year, they met Racing for the first time, a match that from the first moment was a derby since their new neighbors were not happy sharing the city. The derby was won by Independiente 3–2, with a goal from Rosendo Degiorgi close to the hour mark. They also met River Plate in a friendly match, where the white IFBC won 3–1 with goals from Julio Mantecón, Juan Irigoyen and Miguel Peluffo.
There was a clear difference in level between the AFA&#x27;s Second Division and the Central League to which they were accustomed. Their first participation in AFA culminated in the second-to-last place, which relegated them to the 1908 Third Division and led to the departure of some original players, such as Rosendo Degiorgi. With a bad performance at the league, poor stadium condition and the members having to travel on horse to a field far away from their houses, it was a matter of discussion whether Independiente should have continued existing, but passion for football won and further efforts were made.

Soon after, thanks to the incorporation of twelve champion footballers with Racing, who &quot;crossed the street&quot; after an internal conflict of that club (among them Germán Vidaillac, founder), Independiente radically changed its face and once again gained access to the Second Division after being runner-up in the only season of the club&#x27;s history in Third Division, with an impressive record of 14 victories out of 14 games played (40 goals for and only 4 against), but, unfortunately, they failed to finish the season with a title as they lost the championship final to Banfield 0–3 at the Estadio GEBA. The newcomers also helped to improve the stadium condition.

Independiente adopted, also in 1908, its distinctive red color, about which there are two theories; the &quot;traditional&quot; one is that it was the idea of the president and goalkeeper Aristides Langone, due to his fanaticism for the English team Nottingham Forest, who toured Argentina against local teams and left the Argentine public amazed. On the other hand, it is also true that Julio Mantecón, an important member of the Socialist Party, was the general secretary and forward, for whom bright red symbolized the workers&#x27; struggle. The red shirts where accompanied by the club&#x27;s first red &quot;emblem&quot; (a red seal), and the acronym continued to be IFBC (until 1914).

In 1909 arrived José Buruca Laforia, the club&#x27;s first &quot;professional&quot; incorporation, with whom Independiente won its first official title as champions of the Bullrich Cup (a second-tier league cup), beating important teams of the time such as GEBA (4–0), Ferro Carril Oeste (1–0), Estudiantil Porteño (3–2) and the second teams of Alumni (1–0) and San Isidro (1–0). The final game against San Isidro was played on 8 September at the Ferro Stadium (the oldest stadium still standing in Argentina), and the winning goal was scored by Francisco Viegas. In the league, after playing two more years in the Second Division, in 1911 they were transferred to the newly created Intermediate Division.

During the Intermedia season (1911) the club continued its institutional grow, as they settled in another field in the Mitre Avenue, centre of Crucecita. There they built the Estadio Crucecita, made up completely in wood for around 4,000 spects (later expanded to 10,000), and inaugurated with a victory over Estudiantil Porteño. That year the red team fought for the championship until the end along Estudiantes, losing to them at the last date and finishing as runners-up. However, due to the leagues being reorganized again, Independiente was promoted to the Primera División, seven years after its foundation.

On 4 February 1912 the red team won its first friendly international cup, the Anglo-Argentine Association Trophy, by 3–0 over Uruguayan side Universal, with a brace from Enrique Colla and one from Francisco Roldán.

In 14 July, 1912, Independiente debuted in the Primera División against Kimberley (winning 3–0 in Avellaneda), finishing the tournament as runners-up after the red squad decided to withdraw the final versus Porteño claiming an unfairly disallowed goal. Enrique Colla of Independiente was the top scorer of the tournament, with 12 goals. In October, the Reds traveled to Montevideo to play a match abroad for the first time, which resulted in a 2-0 victory for the Uruguayan team River Plate.

In 1914, Julio Mantecón proposed to Spanishize the club name from the original IFBC to &quot;Club Atlético Independiente&quot;, since the English language had already fallen into disuse. The motion was approved by club president Juan Mignaburu. Later, other sports began to be added, the first being basketball.
In 1916 Independiente reached the Copa Jockey Club final, which they lost to Rosario Central 1–2. The following year, they reached the final again, beating Estudiantes 2–1 and winning its first title under its current name with goals from Juan Cánepa and Guillermo Ronzoni, thus also achieving its first first-tier title and its first classification to an international tournament; the 1917 Tie Cup. There they lost to Montevideo Wanderers, Uruguayan champions, 0-4.

In relation to the previous achievement, Independiente had reached the final of the 1914 La Nación Cup, but it was cancelled because its rivals Argentino de Quilmes were disaffiliated from the AFA before the final, leaving Independiente &quot;champions by desk&quot;.

The Avellaneda team managed to become champions of the Argentine Primera División for the first time in 1922, a tough championship where Independiente finished ahead of River Plate, San Lorenzo and Racing, who finished second, third and fourth respectively, with an impressive record of 97 goals in that season, of which Manuel Seoane scored 55 of them, keeping a record of most goals in a single Primera División championship by one player. In 1923, Independiente finished as runners-up, in part as a result of Seoane and Ronzoni being banned for one year due to an incident with a referee.

In the 1920s, international tours of British teams to Argentina were common, with which Independiente faced for the first team a European club in 1923, beating Scottish team Third Lanark 2–1 at the River Plate Stadium with a Raimundo Orsi brace.

Manuel Seoane returned to the team in 1926 and led Independiente to win its second Primera División title, being nicknamed &quot;Diablos Rojos&quot; (Red Devils) since this moment among the football public, after the journalist Hugo Marini of the Crítica journal described as &quot;devilish&quot; the forward line (the old 2-3-5 style) starring Manuel Seoane, Alberto Lalín, Raimundo Orsi, Luis Ravaschino and Zoilo Canavery.

Raimundo Orsi went on to become Independiente&#x27;s first globally recognized figure, having won the 1927 Copa América and an Olympic medal for Argentina and then moving to Juventus, before winning the 1934 World Cup with the Italian national team, scoring in the Final against Czechoslovakia. Being world champion, in 1935 he returned to Independiente, possibly escaping from the Fascist regime; prior to the World Cup final, Benito Mussolini met the Italian team and demanded them to &quot;win or die&quot;.

=== Relocation to Avellaneda ===
In 1925 club president Pedro Canaveri made an offer to buy the Estadio Crucecita land, but it was rejected. That meant they had to move again, so they purchased a low-priced uninhabited swampy land located within the limits of the Avellaneda city between the Racing Stadium and the Great Southern Railway tracks, further fueling the rivalry with its neighbors. There he built the Alsina y Cordero Stadium (later named &quot;la Doble Visera&quot;), the first cement stadium in Argentina and third in the world. It was built on a large swamp, which had to be dried and filled with tons of stone and earth. The club had to go through repeated attempts by the &quot;racinguist&quot; mayor of Avellaneda, Alberto Barceló, to try to sabotage the construction of the stadium by sending municipal employees to take the material, trying to paralyze the works and, finally, trying to invent a street where the swamp had just been filled in. However, the club managed to move forward with the construction, taking the cause to the main media in Buenos Aires and even firing the municipals with gunshots.

stadium was inaugurated on 8 March 1928 in a friendly against Peñarol, and served for more than ten years as the main stadium for the Argentina national team. Some of the stands where reused from the former Crucecita stadium, until they were replaced by concrete ones.

After the first experience with Third Lanark, new European clubs made it to Argentina, and consequently Independiente beat FC Barcelona (Spanish champions) 4–1 in 1928 and Bologna (Italian champions) 1–0 in 1929. They also faced Chelsea (1–1 tie) and Torino (1–2 defeat). Contrary to the Europeans, Independiente was still an amateur club. Arcadi Balaguer, president of FC Barcelona, became surprised after realizing that Independiente defender Guillermo Ronzoni was the guy selling tickets at the stadium&#x27;s entrance a few minutes before the match started. That day, the Diablos Rojos won the Catalans with a brace from Manuel Seoane and a goal from Canavery and Orsi each, with the Argentine coat of arms sewn on the jersey by initiative of the Argentine President Hipólito Yrigoyen.

Independiente was among the 18 clubs that broke from AFA to form the Liga Argentina de Football in 1931, the first professional league in the country. They also were already considered one of the Big Five, along Boca Juniors, Racing, River Plate and San Lorenzo. Zoilo Canavery, who retired in 1930 wearing the red shirt, was appointed as the club&#x27;s first official manager in 1932.

Manuel Seoane retired in 1933 with an impressive record of 241 goals in 264 appearances with the red shirt, setting a record of all time scorer of the Primera División. At the end of the 1930s the club, now professional, entered a path of titles led by its three new figures: Arsenio Erico, Antonio Sastre and Vicente de la Mata, one of the most offensive tridents in the history of football, with 556 goals in total. This team led Independiente to win two Primera championships (1938 and 1939), three national cups and three international cups. In 1938 they won the club&#x27;s first international title at the legendary Estadio Centenario in Montevideo (place where Uruguay was world champion in 1930), beating Peñarol 3–1 with goals from De la Mata, Zorrilla and Erico. The coach responsible for the two triple crowns was Guillermo Ronzoni, today the winningest coach in the history of Independiente, who also was a defender between 1917 and 1928.
In 1939, an Independiente-River Plate combined team beat 3–1 a Flamengo-Vasco da Gama combination, in an overcrowded Estadio Gasómetro, winning the &quot;Copa Confraternidad Argentino-Brasileña&quot;. Erico and Juan Maril of Independiente scored two out of the three Argentine goals. At the end of 1939, the Independiente team toured Brazil for the first time, meeting clubs Vasco da Gama, Flamengo, Botafogo, Atlético Mineiro, América Mineiro, Internacional and Grêmio. The peak moment of the tour was an 8-1 victory over Botafogo. In 1941 they won the Ministry of the Treasury Cup in Paraguay by 4–2 over Cerro Porteño, champions of that country.

In 1940 the biggest win in the Clásico de Avellaneda took place, with Independiente defeating Racing 7–0 with braces from Zorrilla, Erico, De la Mata and one from Leguizamón. That same day, the same record had already occurred among the reserve teams, where Independiente won 10–0. The famous offensive trident was dismantled in 1941 with the departure of Antonio Sastre to São Paulo. Some time later the Argentine Football Association considered him the &quot;most complete Argentine player of all time.&quot;

Arsenio Erico, for his part, retired in 1946 having become the new top scorer in the history of the Argentine Primera División with 295 goals (a record he still holds) overshadowing Manuel Seoane&#x27;s record, and Vicente de la Mata was the last to retire, leading &quot;el Rojo&quot; to become champions in 1948 under the coaching of Fernando Bello, who was the goalkeeper for eleven seasons between 1933 and 1944. Alfredo Di Stéfano (&quot;2008&quot;) considered Arsenio Erico &quot;the most extraordinary player&quot; he saw in his life.

In 1953 the Avellaneda team made its first tour of Europe, where it debuted at the Bernabéu Stadium achieving a historic 6-0 win over Real Madrid at a full stadium, a Real Madrid starring Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento and other future &quot;Galácticos&quot; who would later win five consecutive European Cups. Rodolfo Micheli scored a hat-trick, while the other three goals were scored by Bonelli, Grillo and Cecconatto.

The European tour continued with a 2–1 against Benfica, 8–1 against Sporting in Portugal, 5-3 against Atlético Madrid and 3-0 against Valencia in the Mestalla. The tour concluded with defeats to FC Rouen in France and Huddersfield Town in England, both 2-3. In Avellaneda they also hosted several powerful teams of the time, winning 4–2 against Rot-Weiss (champions of West Germany) in 1954, 6–1 against La Chaux-de-Fonds (champions of Switzerland) in 1954, 3–0 against Red Star (champions of Yugoslavia) in 1955, 1-0 against CSKA Sofia (champions of Bulgaria) in 1962, 2–0 against FC Dinamo Moscow (champions of the Soviet Union) in 1963, 3–0 against Austria Vienna (champions of Austria) in 1964, 3–2 against Sparta Prague (champions of Czechoslovakia) in 1966, and 4-1 against Torpedo Moscow (champions of the Soviet Union) in 1969.

=== The golden era ===

The &quot;golden era&quot; of the club started in the early 1960s, along the birth of the South American continental cups. As 1963 Primera División champions, they won the Copa Libertadores de América for the first time in 1964, being the first Argentine team to do so, beating Millonarios (champions of Colombia), Alianza Lima (champions of Peru) and Santos (champions of Brazil) in the initial phases, and in the final against Nacional (champions of Uruguay) 1–0, with a goal from Mario Rodríguez Varela. Then they defended the title in 1965, won four consecutive Libertadores in 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and obtained his last one in 1984, establishing themselves as the competition&#x27;s top winner with seven titles, to which are added the difficult records of being champions in four consecutive editions; and seven finals played, without having lost any of them. As a colorful note, in the 1964 Libertadores they eliminated in the semifinals the difficult team of the Brazilian Santos, current two-time world champion, starring Pelé and other stars of the two-time world champion Brazilian national team. The English magazine FourFourTwo (&quot;2024&quot;) described Independiente from 1971-1975 as the third best team in the history of the Americas, just behind Santos from 1955-1968 and Brazil from 1970.

It is also worth noting that Independiente achieved its Copa Libertadores title record after winning its fourth one at the 1973 finals defeating Chilean champions Colo-Colo 2-1 at Estadio Centenario, therefore surpassing Peñarol and Estudiantes three-title record. That same year, the red team also achieved the 1973 Copa Interamericana and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup, giving rise to the nickname of &quot;Rey de Copas&quot; (King of Cups).

In 1975, the club from Avellaneda made its first tour of Asia, performing friendly games against Indonesian and Hong Kong teams. Since almost all Asian teams wore red, and Independiente didn&#x27;t carry any alternative kits, they were given yellow Sweden jerseys, which were later used in the 1975 Copa Libertadores finals against Unión Española.
At the 1976 Copa Libertadores, after four years of success, the red team finally got knocked out by River Plate 1–0 in the semifinals, very close of reaching a fifth consecutive final. However, soonly after they won the postponed 1976 Copa Interamericana (the third in a row) against Mexican side Atlético Español through the penalty shoot-out after two ties at the Venezuelan Olympic Stadium.

At the local level, Independiente continued to win titles. The most particular was the 1977 Nacional, a tournament where they faced Talleres in the final. Having tied in Avellaneda, the teams played the definition in Córdoba. The Córdoba team took the lead with a controversial handball goal, validated by referee Barreiro, who also sent off three Independiente players for protesting. However, with only seven field players, Independiente won through an excellent goal from a play scored by Ricardo Bochini shortly before the end of the match. The main media stated that the referee would have been, at halftime, &quot;influenced&quot; by Luciano B. Menéndez, one of the generals of the civil-military dictatorship. Bochini (&quot;2010&quot;) stated that this fact cost him the call to the 1978 and 1982 World Cups, making his debut in 1986 against Belgium.

In 1983, another unprecedented event occurred again at the local level when Independiente became Argentine champion, competing on the last date in La Doble Visera against archi-rivals Racing, a team that was relegated to Primera B for the first time in its history. This title led to winning the 1984 Copa Libertadores, the club&#x27;s seventh, beating Grêmio in the finals with a goal from Jorge Burruchaga.

On the world stage, they won the aforementioned Copa Interamericana three times, in 1973, 1974 and 1976 against the CONCACAF champions, and participated six times in the prestigious Intercontinental Cup; being world champion in 1973, beating Italian Juventus 1–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome (goal by Bochini), and in 1984, beating Liverpool at the Tokyo Olympic Stadium (goal by José Percudani). The duel against Liverpool was special, since it was the first confrontation between Argentine and British teams after the Falklands War that occurred two years earlier and marked the end of the civil-military dictatorship. The entire Argentine public supported Independiente, and its victory gave it the nickname of &quot;National Pride&quot; in all the newspapers. The other four participations in the Intercontinental ended in defeats against Inter Milan (twice), Ajax Amsterdam and Atlético Madrid (although not without having visited historic stadiums such as the San Siro, the Bernabéu, the Amsterdam Olympic and Vicente Calderón). Ricardo Bochini, who completed a long career at the club between 1973 and 1991, is remembered as the institution&#x27;s greatest idol, scoring the goal against Juventus and having a 19-year career at Independiente, where he won twelve titles (record which he shares with Ricardo Pavoni).
Other highlights on the non-competitive stage include the winning of the 1965 Consular Cup 2–1 on aggregate over Napoli (first in New York and then in Toronto), beating Greek Panathinaikos (champions of Europe) 1–0 in Athens in 1972, beating Inter Milan 1–0 in the Estadio Azteca in 1974, tying 2–2 with the famous American team New York Cosmos on their 1985 farewell season, and playing an unofficial club world championship in 1989 against Arsenal (champions of England), which they lost in Miami 2–1.

In 1994 and 1995, &quot;el Rojo&quot; obtained two more international titles; the two-time Supercopa Libertadores, the first against Boca Juniors and the second against a Romário-led Flamengo, at the latter becoming the first foreign club to be crowned champions at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, before an impressive attendance of 105,000 Brazilian spectators. They also won the 1995 Recopa Sudamericana, played at the Tokyo Olympic Stadium (same place where they beat Liverpool in 1984).

Additionally, they won the 1994 Copa Presidente Carlos Menem by defeating Napoli 3–2 in the semifinals and Roma 2–1 in the final in Mar del Plata. Before playing the 1995 Recopa, the red team faced and won Sanfrecce Hiroshima 5–0 and Urawa Red Diamonds 5–3. One year later, Independiente travelled once again all the way to Japan to contest the 1996 Recopa Sudamericana in Kōbe, but this time they lost 1–4 to Grêmio. In 1997, they beat Feyenoord 3–0 in Mar del Plata, with the Dutchmen starring Ronald Koeman.

The &quot;golden era&quot; of Independiente came to an end in 1995 and, from then on, the sporting achievements occurred in a more isolated way. Nothing that relevant occurred between the 1995–2010 period, except for the isolated 2002 Aperture title, where the pillar was team captain Gabriel Milito. In 2004 club legend José Pastoriza died while at his fifth stint as the club manager. Some days before, Independiente won the DAIA Cup 1–0 to El Salvador. Among other players, a young Sergio Agüero was sold to Atlético Madrid for a record US$28,75 million in 2006, which was planned to be used for a complete renovation of the La Doble Visera to a brand new stadium.

=== New stadium and hard times ===

As the old Doble Visera stadium was in severe decay, the project of a new and modern stadium advanced, made possible by the Sergio Agüero record transfer to Europe. On 8 December, 2006, the farewell match took place against Gimnasia with 1–2 defeat. While the Estadio Libertadores de América was under construction, Independiente acted as home team at several Primera División stadiums, mostly the near Racing Stadium. The &quot;Estadio LDA&quot; was officially inaugurated on 28 October, 2009 with a 3-2 victory over Colón. However, as the construction costs were higher than the estimated, it was inaugurated half built, even with the old Almirante Cordero grandstand left standing.

Despite the also millionaire transfers of Oscar Ustari and Germán Denis, Independiente went through critical moments in the institutional and football sphere with million-dollar debts, embargoes, inhibitions from AFA and FIFA and even bankruptcy petitions. The team finished at the league&#x27;s last places on various occasions. However, the club performed well at the 2009–10 season and qualified to the 2010 Copa Sudamericana, which they won at home soil after defeating Goiás at the finals through the penalty shootout. Nonetheless, at the same time they finished at the bottom place of the 2010 Aperture. On the fifth date of the 2012 Clausura, Independiente beat reigning Argentine champions Boca Juniors 5–4 away at La Bombonera.
As a result of the poor performances since the 2010 Aperture, aggravated by the bad management and institutional crises, Independiente finished in second-to-last place in the point averages at the end of the 2012-13 season, getting relegated to the Primera B Nacional for the first time after 101 years in the Primera División (after a 0-1 home loss to San Lorenzo at the second-to-last date) alongside San Martín (18th) and Unión (20th). At the institutional level, the crisis had the Estadio Libertadores de América half built and in a state of abandonment, like all the facilities and club training fields, and the club directors being threatened by barra bravas (hooligans). One month later, the team debuted in the B with a 1-2 home defeat to a promoted third division team, Brown, remaining five rounds without knowing the victory and facing relegation to the Primera B Metropolitana.

Despite the serious macroeconomic crisis of the club, former champion players Daniel Montenegro, Federico Insúa, Federico Mancuello and Facundo Parra returned to lend a hand, with whom &quot;el Rojo&quot; recovered from the bad start and achieved promotion again in 2014 by winning a final for the third promotion spot to Huracán. Under the presidency of Hugo Moyano, chief of the CGT, Independiente advanced in the completion works of the stadium and was champion in the 2017 Copa Sudamericana versus Vinícius Júnior&#x27;s Flamengo and, later, the 2018 Suruga Bank Championship held in Osaka, Japan, which extended the international record of the club recognized by CONMEBOL to 18 titles and recovered its record as the club with the most international titles in the Americas (shared with Boca Juniors). The team captain Nicolás Tagliafico continued his career in AFC Ajax and ultimately won two times the Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup with the Argentine national team along goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, who also emerged from Independiente&#x27;s youth ranks.

Between the sales of important players the club earned approximately US$42 million. But despite this, in 2022 the Moyanos left the presidency of the club having once again led it to another critical financial situation, with more than US$22 million in debt. By 2023, in addition to former players, Independiente was in big debt with four Mexican clubs (América, UNAM, Tijuana and Mazatlán), with the América one putting Independiente under a TAS-imposed embargo. As a result, a collection was carried out among fans and other donors through a digital wallet raising US$3.5 million, an amount of money that managed to help the club lift that dangerous embargo. At the same time, the team had the worst Primera División campaign in its history, finishing the tournament in 24th place. However, after an austere season and a strong appreciation of the Argentine peso under the Presidency of Javier Milei, the club overcame the red numbers and earned a spot to the 2025 Copa Sudamericana.

==Kit and badge==
The first shirt worn by the club since its foundation in 1904 was white, with a blue badge on its chest with the acronym &quot;IFBC&quot; (&quot;Independiente Football Club&quot;). That badge was inspired on St. Andrew&#x27;s Athletic Club&#x27;s. a club established by Scottish descendants that had been the first Primera División champion in 1891.

The traditional red shirt was not worn until 1908, and was inspired on English side Nottingham Forest, which had toured Argentina in 1905. Independiente executives were so impressed by the performance of &quot;The Forest&quot; that they decide to adopt the red colors for the club. The red shirt debuted on 10 May 1908.

The first badge of the club was also inspired on Saint Andrew&#x27;s and was used until 1912 when the club switched to a red seal. The logo changed again in 1930, being the closest version of the current emblem. It has been modified (with minor alterations) several times since then.

== Stadium ==
Independiente&#x27;s stadium was officially named as &quot;Libertadores de América&quot; in 2005, having been previously known simply as &quot;Estadio de Independiente&quot; or &quot;La Doble Visera de Cemento (The double cement visor&quot;) because of the two roofs overhanging the spectators.

The venue was inaugurated on 4 March 1928 in a match against Peñarol of Uruguay. It was the first concrete stadium in South America and would host all international finals Independiente played as local team (7 of the Copa Libertadores, 3 of the Intercontinental Cups, 2 of the Supercopa Sudamericanas and 2 of the Interamericanas Cup) as well as many Argentina international matches, mostly in the 1930s and 1940s.

The Estadio Libertadores de América was closed for repairs in 2007, and reopened on 28 October 2009 in a league match against Colón, which Independiente won 3–2. During construction, Independiente played their home games in four stadiums.

In July 2014, one of the objectives was the completion of the court. Thus it was that, in the 2–1 victory against Racing on 31 August for the fifth date of the Transition Tournament, the &quot;Bochini Alta&quot; grandstand could be seen finished. In May 2015, the construction of &quot;Garganta 3&quot; began and the &quot;Bochini Baja&quot; grandstand was also completed, plus the boxes and also the Press sector. On 16 December 2016, when facing Banfield, Independiente completely inaugurated the &quot;Libertadores de América&quot;.

<text>Purple Mountain or Zijin Shan () is located on the eastern side of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, China. It is high. Its peaks are often found enveloped in purple and golden clouds at dawn and dusk, hence its name.

A small mountain with an area of about , the altitude of Purple Mountain at the top and foot of the mountain is about and respectively. The annual average rainfall is to , and the average annual sunshine time is about 2,213 hours. Purple Mountain is a mountain related to many historical events of both ancient and modern China. It was originally known as Bell Mountain () and also became known as Mount Jiang () after Sun Quan named Jiang Ziwen, an Eastern Han official whose spirit was said to haunt the site, as the mountain&#x27;s god during the Three Kingdoms era. The name &quot;Zijin&quot; () means &quot;copper&quot; - when copper is pure, it appears purple in color, so in Chinese, it is also called purple-gold. It is also named Mount Jinling (), due to its purple rocks. &quot;Jinling&quot; means &quot;the mount of purple-gold&quot;. It is the origin of the nickname &quot;Jinling&quot; () of Nanjing. During the Ming dynasty, it was also called Mount Shenlie ().

More than 200 heritage and scenic tourist sites are now located in or around the mountain, including three national historical sites, nine provincial historical sites, and 33 prefectural historical sites. Located in or close to the hillside of the mountain, there are also about a dozen national research institutes and universities. The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the tomb of Sun Yat-sen, and the Meiling Palace, the residence of Soong Meiling, are located at the foot of the mountain.

Purple Mountain has 621 species of vascular plants, from 383 genera, 118 families (including 78 cultivated species).

<doc id="1121871" wikidata="Q1132520" url="?curid=1121871" title="Corel Linux">
<text>Corel Linux, also called Corel LinuxOS, was a Debian-based operating system made by Corel that began beta testing on September 21, 1999 and was released to the public on November 15, 1999. It mainly competed against Windows 98 and Windows 2000 by Microsoft, plus Mac OS 9 by Apple. Corel later discontinued the distribution, but did not remove the former Corel Open Source Development website until March 2002.

Corel did not use KFM, the standard KDE file manager. It instead used its own file manager, CFM. This, along with other modifications Corel made, made the operating system incompatible with other versions of Linux much more so than other competitors in the industry. At a time when there was relatively little commercial Linux software available, this was a serious hurdle for Corel and its users.

The operating system&#x27;s Second Edition was released on August 15, 2000, in download, regular and deluxe editions. The latter bundled Corel WordPerfect Office for Linux.

Xandros purchased the Corel Linux source code and development team when Corel scrapped its Linux business in August 2001.

== System requirements ==
== Features ==
Corel Linux featured a file manager that was very close in look and feel to Windows Explorer. The file manager provided an integrated Windows SMB network browser. The company also advertised that the operating system was compatible with its flagship software.

=== Applications ===
The key selling point of Corel Linux was its compatibility with the company&#x27;s WordPerfect applications. The eponymous word processor&#x27;s eighth version was given away to personal customers in the hopes that they would purchase WordPerfect Office 2000. This suite added the Quattro Pro, Corel Presentations and CorelCentral programs. The Deluxe version of that suite added the Paradox database manager and &quot;Railroad Tycoon II: Gold&quot;. The latter omits a level editor, the network mode and some scenarios from the original game. The &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27; of Corel Linux Deluxe came with instead of Railroad Tycoon II. Unlike the free WordPerfect 8, the office suite was not written natively for Linux, but instead consisted of the Windows programs powered by Corel&#x27;s fork of the Wine compatibility layer. As a result, the Linux suite suffered from a performance penalty compared to the Windows version and WordPerfect 8.

As with the WordPerfect suite, Corel adapted its graphics applications to run on Linux using Wine. This consisted of the CorelDraw (stylized CorelDRAW) suite. While the eponymous program was paid software, Corel Photo-Paint was available as a free download.

=== SmartMove === 
Corel SmartMove was a part of Corel Linux. This application provided the following:
# Migrate Microsoft Windows settings to Corel Linux.
# Automate restoring settings that are changed by SmartMove.
# Provide an easy way to access network folders through Corel Linux.

SmartMove was built around the Wine libraries to read the Windows Registry settings for the Windows applications and thus be able to migrate them. SmartMove core libraries created a wrapper for the Windows registry to easily look up the settings.
SmartMove looks for existing Microsoft Windows installations on the machine, looks a little further for individual users, and offers to transfer application settings to analogous programs under Linux. It understands how to deal with Internet Explorer and Netscape cookies and bookmarks, Outlook, mIRC, and ICQ settings, and a variety of desktop preferences, including wallpaper, color scheme, and even mouse &quot;handedness&quot;. We tried it out with a few settings, but since our Windows installation was fairly new, we didn&#x27;t have much to check against.
With the death of Corel Linux, this application faded away and is no longer maintained, however similar functionality is now available on at least Ubuntu when installing a dual-boot configuration on a machine that already has Windows on it.

<doc id="1121874" wikidata="Q3545997" url="?curid=1121874" title="Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation">
<text>The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (MBQ) (Mohawk: &quot;Kenhtè:ke Kanyen&#x27;kehà:ka&quot; ) are a Mohawk community within Hastings County, Ontario. They control the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, which is a Mohawk Indian reserve on the Bay of Quinte in southeastern Ontario, Canada, east of Belleville and immediately to the west of Deseronto. They also share Glebe Farm 40B and the Six Nations of the Grand River reserves with other First Nations.

The community takes its name from a variant spelling of Mohawk leader Joseph Brant&#x27;s traditional Mohawk name, &quot;Thayendanegea&quot; (standardized spelling Thayentiné:ken), which means &#x27;two pieces of fire wood beside each other&#x27;. Officially in the Mohawk language, the community is called Kenhtè:ke, which means &quot;on the bay&quot; (from Mohawk &quot;kénhte&quot; &quot;bay&quot;, which is also the origin of the word &quot;Quinte&quot;). The Cayuga name is &quot;Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ&quot;, &#x27;land of two logs&#x27;. The nation&#x27;s band number is 164.

==Overview==
The territory of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (MBQ), represent one of the largest First Nations territories in Ontario.

Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory has ties to the birthplace of the Great Peacemaker, Dekanahwideh, who was instrumental in the bringing together the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca into the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, according to Kayanesenh Paul Williams, a Six Nations lawyer and author.

The traditional land of the MBQ, which was much more vast that the current territory, was based on a variation of the traditional Mohawk name of Joseph Brant, &quot;Thayendanegea&quot;, which means &quot;two pieces of fire wood beside each other&quot;. In the Cayuga language the name is &quot;Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ&quot;—&quot;land of two logs&quot;. The geographical feature, the bay is &quot;kénhte&quot; in the Mohawk language and the community&#x27;s official Mohawk name is &quot;Kenhtè:ke&quot;—&quot;on the bay&quot;. It was anglicized to &quot;Quinte&quot;.

The Mohawk nation reserve covers in Hastings County on the Bay of Quinte in southeastern Ontario, Canada, east of Belleville and immediately to the west of the township of Deseronto.

== History ==
Following the American Revolution, the Mohawk, who were allies of the British Crown, lost their traditional homelands in the Mohawk Valley of what became New York state, when they were forced to cede their lands following the defeat of the British. As compensation for their allegiance, the Crown offered them unsettled land in Upper Canada. A group of Mohawk led by John Deseronto selected the Bay of Quinte because it was said to be the birthplace of Tekanawita, one of the founders of the Iroquois Confederacy in the 12th century. The majority of the Mohawk followed Joseph Brant to the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in what has become the province of Ontario.

On May 22, 1784, the group of 20 Mohawk families (between 100 and 125 people) arrived at Tyendinaga. Nine years later, the Tyendinaga tract of land was officially set aside under Crown Treaty 3½, signed on April 1, 1793, by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe and thereafter known as the &#x27;Simcoe Deed&#x27;. This tract of land, measuring was legally accepted by the British Crown, and subsequently by the Upper Canada government.

A wave of Loyalists also settled in the Bay of Quinte area, and the government granted many of them land in the Tyendinaga Tract. During the period from 1820 to 1843, the Mohawk lost two-thirds of the treaty lands of the Simcoe Deed. Additional land loss has left the Mohawk with only in this area today.

The major new settlement for the Mohawk and other Iroquois in Canada was the Six Nations Reserve of the Grand River (where prominent Mohawk leader Joseph Brant struggled with the colonial government for control of the land). In addition, Mohawk and others joined the existing communities of Kahnawake, Kanesatake, Wahta and Akwesasne (the latter four were mostly Mohawk settlements established along the St. Lawrence River during the colonial era prior to the war).

In 1869, the &quot;Gradual Enfranchisement Act&quot; was passed by the Canadian federal government, establishing elected band councils on First Nations reserves. The first election for the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte elected council took place in October 1870, where seven chiefs were elected to sit on the council.

==Land claims==

In 1995 the MBQ filed a claim on an area which covers 923 acres of land surrounding the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory area, which included most of the land upon which the township of Deseronto has been built. In 2003, the federal government entered into initial land claims negotiations on the Culbertson Tract land claim.

The claim is based on Loyalist settlers allegedly acquiring Mohawk traditional land illegally, during the period from 1820 to 1843, resulting in the loss of the majority of the land from the Simcoe Treaty. As set out in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the terms and conditions for purchasing land from Mohawk included the requirement of a community vote prior to sales of any common land to non-Mohawk. Research and documentation has shown that these terms and conditions may not have been followed at Tyendinaga. The Township created a &quot;Catalogue of Culbertson Tract Land Claim documents collection&quot; in its archives. Chief Don Maracle renewed a call for negotiations to continue in 2011, following a period of stagnation. A symposium entitled &quot;The Land that Supports our Feet&quot;, was held in Belleville in 2013 which was well-attended.

In June 2013, Justice Rennie of the Federal Court of Canada ruled in &quot;Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)&quot;, that expropriation is one of several viable alternatives available to the government under the law.

==Long-term Drinking Water Advisories (DWA)==

The Mohawk of the Bay of Quinte have been under a Drinking Water Advisory since 2008, &quot;due to fecal, bacterial and algae contaminations&quot;. During a drought in the area, many of the groundwater wells—upon which they had depended—went completely dry.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, supply chains from manufacturers were disrupted, resulting in an increase in the water main project from about $8.1 million to $18.2 million. In December 2020, the federal government had announced new funding of $16.7 million to &quot;cover the cost of extending the water mains&quot; from the township of Deseronto and the MBQ&#x27;s own water-treatment plants which will then be able to serve five areas in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory.

This funding supports the final phase in the &quot;multi-phase project to improve access to safe drinking water for the MBQ community. The federal government and the First Nation invested a combined total of $18.2 million towards the project, which will &quot;ultimately lift five long-term drinking water advisories in the community&quot;. This final phase has been contracted out to Gordon Barr Limited, who began construction work in December 2020. The new water mains will link the MBQ&#x27;s and Deseronto&#x27;s water treatment plant, thereby connecting &quot;86 existing homes and several of the community&#x27;s semi-public buildings&quot;.
By 2021, there were about 2,200 people living on the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte reserve with another 3,000 Mohawks living nearby. Of these, there are about 90 families &quot;on a waiting list for affordable housing&quot;.

==Government==
The Tyendinaga Mohawk Council consists of one Chief and four Councillors, chosen during elections every two years, as per the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. On December 4, 2017, Council adopted a motion &#x27;to approve to adopt the &quot;First Nations Election Act&quot; [FNEA] regulations for the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory in 2019&#x27;, but Council has not officially adopted a custom election code or opted into the FNEA as of December 2018.

=== Government history ===
From the start, the government of the Mohawk community at the Bay of Quinte consisted of a council of chiefs selected following Haudenosaunee democratic tradition. When the Mohawks first came to the Bay of Quinte, they were led by Captain John Deserontyon, and he was then the first leader of the community. Between the time of the landing in 1784 and Captain John&#x27;s death in 1811, the government consisted of so-called &quot;community chiefs,&quot; &quot;war chiefs,&quot; and Captain John himself, who was considered the &quot;headman.&quot; All functions of government went through Captain John, and as such the finer points of the government structure are unclear, for instance how many chiefs made up the council.

Upon Captain John&#x27;s death in 1811, there is evidence from external correspondence with other governments that six chiefs may have led the community in the early 1800s. Extant documents from the 1820s and 1830s include signatures from groups of four chiefs, five chiefs, and six chiefs. In 1835, with the conversion of over 60 community members to Methodism and their subsequent exodus to the Grand River, the number of chiefs on the Quinte Mohawk council was reduced by two, resulting in a council size of four, referred to as &quot;the old chiefs,&quot; Brant Brant, Powles Claus, Joseph Pinn, and one other.

In 1843, owing to frustration among the community with how the old chiefs were organizing things, as well as complaints of their alcoholism and the poor decision they had made, the community got together to change the government structure. From this point on, the government was composed of four chiefs and four councilmen, who managed administrative needs such as finances and letter-writing, while the chiefs led the community more broadly. A little while after this, the structure was changed again, so that government consisted of two chiefs and two councilmen, who were chosen by &quot;their equals&quot; (i.e. other &quot;warriors&quot;), as well as a secretary and a treasurer. Trish Rae of Tsi Tyónnheht Onkwawén:na refers to this six-person council as the &quot;managing council,&quot; and notes that the four old chiefs remained important members of the community, responsible for signing documents, but only two sat on this managing council.

According to research done by Trish Rae, from the 1840s and increasingly through the 1860s, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs played a more active role in nominating candidates to the managing council, which Rae characterizes as meddling. In 1858, Superintendent Thomas Gummersall Anderson named two men as councillors, and the community chose three other men to be on council—resulting in a council of five. The only one of the &quot;old chiefs&quot; on this 1858 council was Powles Claus. The following year, Visiting Superintendent W. R. Bartlett again named two men to council (Powles Claus and Thomas Claus), while three men were elected by the community (Seth W. Hill, John Loft, and William Maracle). Ultimately, the Superintendent called an end to widespread community-internal elections between 1860 and 1870, claiming that &quot;they&#x27;re a great deal of trouble, and much ill feeling was caused by the intemperance and excitement.&quot; Seth W. Hill was removed from council for intemperance in 1860, and replaced at an election by William J. W. Hill. In 1863, John Loft was dismissed from council also due to intemperance, but was not replaced, leaving a council of four. In 1866, the last remaining of the four &quot;old chiefs&quot; Powles Claus died, reducing the council further to three. Historical evidence indicates that the community had selected Seth Powless to replace the old chief, but he was a controversial figure and not accepted by the whole community—some thought he had &quot;made himself&quot; a chief, though historical evidence is inconclusive.

By December 1868, there were three men in the community who could still claim the title of &quot;old chief&quot; (i.e. a chief following the traditional method of selection), Chiefs Thomas Green, Joseph Penn, and Seth Powless. Fearing that the traditional form of governance they represented would be upset by upcoming legislation (the &quot;Gradual Enfranchisement Act&quot; of 1869 would be the first official imposition of a government structure by Canada on indigenous governments), the three wrote a letter to an Indian Affairs official to implore them to see the value in their traditional ways of governance. In May 1869, the old chiefs wrote another letter alongside others in the community asking to be exempted from the upcoming legislation. The &quot;Gradual Enfranchisement Act&quot;, passed on June 22, 1869, instituted official band council elections under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Ministry for Indian Affairs. Under the 1869 act, councils were elected by men aged 21 years and older, with one chief and two &quot;secondary chiefs&quot; per 200 people in the community. The term of office under the act was 3 years, though the legislation also allowed &quot;life chiefs&quot; that were in power when the legislation was enacted to remain in their role until death, resignation, or removal by the Governor-General.

In February 1870, Superintendent Bartlett finally offered to name somebody to replace the late Powles Claus, as long as the community elected somebody to replace the late John Loft. However, this never took place. Instead, in October 1870, the first election under the new federal legislation took place. Seven men were elected following the &quot;Gradual Enfranchisement Act&quot;.

Around this same time, a group of around 200 who did not want to take part in the legislated system gathered to form a traditional council, following the old ways. This group had help from eighteen chiefs from Grand River, and they reported the creation of this traditional council to the Secretary of State. The chiefs named to this council were Chiefs Thomas Green, Joseph Penn, Seth Powless, Cornelius Maracle (unclear whether this is the same man as on the elected council, possibly Turtle clan), James Brant (likely Bear clan), David Powless (likely Wolf clan), John Brant, Simon Hill (likely Bear clan), and Brant Powless (likely the brother of Seth). Critics of this traditional council wrote to the Secretary of State to warn him about what they characterized as a power-grab by Seth Powless, backed by &quot;pagan&quot; &quot;foreigners,&quot; and entreating the protection of the government as Christians.

On October 15, 1889, there was again a selection of chiefs in the traditional way. The chief titles were filled as follows:

* Turtle clan titles:
** Tehkarihoken - Joseph I. Brant
** Ayonwatha - vacant
** Sadekariwadeh - vacant
* Wolf clan titles:
** Sahrehowaneh - Charles B. Brant
** Deyonhehgiveh - Jeremiah Hill
** Orenrehgowah - vacant
* Bear clan titles:
** Dehharagereneh - James B. Brant
** Rastawehserondah - David J. Powless
** Sosskoharowaneh - Peter John

This selection was once again done with help from people from Six Nations, and in consultation with women in the community, including Katherine Brant (likely the mother of Joseph I. Brant), Lina Brant, Lucy Sero, Margaret Jo Brant, Cecilia Ann Brant (mother of Jeremiah Hill), Rachel Maracle, and Mary John (sister of Peter John), whose names are listed at the bottom of the declaration affirming the above chiefs. Though many members of the community supported a return to a traditional council, the government of Canada did not allow it.

In 1915, supporters of Thunder Water, a man who was interested in the education of indigenous people, the improvement of women&#x27;s rights, and a traditional form of governance, ran for council. His supporters were elected, which greatly displeased the Indian Agent, prompting him to write letters complaining about them.

On September 21, 1916, there was another installation of traditional chiefs:

* Turtle clan titles:
** Tehkarihoken - Will Green (substitutes: R. J. Barnhart, Fred Sero)
** Ayonwatha - J. J. Brant (substitute: John W. Maracle)
** Sadekariwadeh - William M. Doreen (substitute: Herbie S. Brant)
* Wolf clan titles:
** Sahrehowaneh - William J. Sero (substitute: Andrew Sero)
** Deyonhehgiveh - Abe Hill (substitute: Peter Doreen)
** Orenrehgowah - Jacob Maracle (substitute: Joe Sero)
* Bear clan titles:
** Dehharagereneh - Solomon J. Brant (substitute: John J. Smart)
** Rastawehserondah - George Hill (substitutes: Johnson Lewis, J. Sero)
** Sosskoharowaneh - P. Buck (substitute: John A. Maracle)

The women who certified this installation included Mrs. K. Hill (most likely Katherine Hill, mother of George Hill), S. B. (possibly a relative of Solomon Brant), and Mrs. Jane D. (most likely Jane Doreen, mother of William Doreen).

In December 1918, the elected council composed of Thunder Water supporters passed a motion abolishing elections, announcing a return to a life chief system. This was rejected by the government of Canada, and the election was to go forward in 1918. Only pro-election candidates were nominated for election, but since that led to only five men being nominated, the nominees were acclaimed into their council positions with no election. In January 1919, the Canadian government wrote a memorandum explaining why they wouldn&#x27;t allow a return to the hereditary system, explaining that firstly, while the Six Nations and Oneida Nation of the Thames did still operate under the traditional system, they would be brought under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; system eventually (and they were, in 1924); secondly, the Canadian government felt the traditional system was cumbersome and antiquated, and &quot;includes selection of chiefs by old women in their dotage.&quot;

Into January 1919, despite the appointment of a new elected council headed by Josiah Hill, the &quot;Thunder Water council&quot; continued to meet and enact resolutions. They locked the council house doors to what they referred to as the &quot;appointed elected council,&quot; and warned the Indian Agent G. M. Campbell that &quot;he is not a governor or ruler of this band of Indians on Tyendinaga Reserve, only a servant to the said band of Indians.&quot; Finally, in February 1919 the locks were broken. On the 4th of that month, a general council meeting with the community was held, and the supporters of the Thunder Water council passed a motion empowering Chief Joseph J. Brant to pursue legal action against the Agent-appointed council. Another motion was passed to seek deeds and treaties from Ottawa, including the &quot;Haldimand Deed,&quot; &quot;the constitution of the proclamation of Sir William Johnson,&quot; and the &quot;Gunshot Treaty&quot; and &quot;other treaties of the Six Nations Indians,&quot; as well as to have all expenses paid by the Department for Indian Affairs.

In April 1919, there was another installation of traditional chiefs. The Minister of the Interior was notified of this installation, and advised that there would be no more elections at the Bay of Quinte. The men installed with chief titles were Joseph J. Brant, Wellington Green, Jacob Maracle, Cornelius J. Maracle, William J. Sero, Abram L. Maracle, William Doreen, George Hill, and Solomon J. Brant. The substitutes were James M. Barnhart, Fred Sero, Ambrose Claus, Jacob Maracle, John W. Maracle, Andrew Sero, Johnson Louis, John Sero, and John J. Smart. The recording secretary was Solomon J. Wright. This petition to the Ministry of Indian Affairs included the names of nearly four hundred community members. And yet, elections under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; system continued. Evidence of continued frustration by Indian Agents indicates that supporters of traditional councils continued to run for and get elected to the elected council.

Elected councils have continued to operate following the &quot;Indian Act&quot; throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

<doc id="1121889" wikidata="Q5284509" url="?curid=1121889" title="Division of Chisholm">
<text>The Division of Chisholm () is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The Division was created in 1949 and is named after Caroline Chisholm, a social worker and promoter of women&#x27;s immigration. The Division is an Inner Metropolitan area. 

The Division&#x27;s current MP is Carina Garland of the Australian Labor Party. The constituency is considered a key marginal constituency targeted by both Labor and the Liberal Party of Australia.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Since 2022, the Division has encompassed the suburbs of Ashwood, Blackburn, Blackburn South, Box Hill, Box Hill South, Burwood, Burwood East, Glen Waverley, Laburnum, Mount Waverley, Notting Hill, Syndal and Wheelers Hill. Additionally, the Division also includes parts of Chadstone, Clayton, Mulgrave and Oakleigh. 

The Division of Chisholm consists of part of the local government areas of Monash City Council and Whitehorse City Council.

== Demographics ==
The Division of Chisholm has a diverse population, with around 54% of its residents being born overseas. Approximately 55% of the population speak a language other than English at home, with Chinese Australians making around 30% of the population. The seat has the largest Chinese community of any electorate in all of Australia.

==History==

On its original boundaries, it was a comfortably safe Liberal seat centred on Camberwell. However, successive redistributions from 1980 onward have moved the electorate south-east, taking in strongly Labor-voting suburbs to balance out the relatively affluent Liberal-leaning suburbs in the north of the seat, and making the seat marginal. The first member for Chisholm, Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes, was one of Australia&#x27;s most distinguished soldiers and a former Olympian, who held the seat until his death on 31 July 1970.

Labor finally took the seat in the 1983 landslide that brought Bob Hawke to power, only to lose it in 1987. Anna Burke became the second Labor member ever to win it in 1998 election and held it until her retirement in 2016. Julia Banks won the seat for the Liberals at the 2016 election, becoming the only Liberal challenger to take a seat from Labor at that election. Taking this seat off Labor turned out to be crucial in ensuring the Coalition retaining its majority; it meant they had 76 seats, as opposed to the 75 they would have had if Labor had retained this seat.

On 27 November 2018, Banks resigned from the Liberal Party due to disaffection with the party resulting from the leadership spill which removed Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister and the treatment of women within the party. Banks announced she would sit on the crossbench as an independent, but guarantee confidence and supply to the Morrison government.

Gladys Liu won Chisholm in the 2019 election for the Liberal Party against Jennifer Yang by less than 0.6%, becoming the first Chinese Australian to enter the lower house.

In 2022, Labor&#x27;s Dr Carina Garland won the seat from Liberal incumbent Liu. The loss of the seat in 2022 to Labor has been attributed to the notably large swings against the Liberal Party among Chinese Australian voters which has cost the Liberal Party many key seats.

<doc id="1121911" wikidata="Q17091005" url="?curid=1121911" title="Murphy's Brewery">
<text>Murphy&#x27;s Brewery, later known as Heineken Brewery Ireland, Ltd, was founded in Cork, Ireland, in 1856 by James J. Murphy. By 1906, Murphy&#x27;s Brewery was Ireland&#x27;s second largest brewer after Guinness. It was known as Lady&#x27;s Well Brewery until it was purchased by Heineken N.V. in 1983, when the name changed to Murphy Brewery Ireland Ltd. The name of the brewery was changed to Heineken Brewery Ireland, Ltd in 2001. The brewery produces Heineken, Murphy&#x27;s Irish Stout and other Heineken products for the Irish market.

==Beers==
===Murphy&#x27;s Stout===

Murphy&#x27;s Irish Stout is a dry stout, brewed to be less bitter than its chief competitor, Guinness. It is sometimes described as having a slightly nutty flavour, with &quot;coffee undertones&quot;. The manufacturers had a television advertising campaign in the 1990s which played on Murphy&#x27;s positioning as less bitter than its competitors, in which the strapline was &quot;like the Murphy&#x27;s, I&#x27;m not bitter&quot;.

===Irish Red===

In 1983, after the Murphy&#x27;s brand was bought by Dutch brewer Heineken International, &quot;Irish Red&quot; was launched for the export market, as it was hoped that it would be more popular than stout overseas.

<doc id="1121922" wikidata="Q2973504" url="?curid=1121922" title="Division of Corio">
<text>The Division of Corio () is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. Named for Corio Bay, it has always been based on the city of Geelong, although in the past it stretched as far east as the outer western suburbs of Melbourne.

The current Member for Corio, since the 2007 federal election, is Richard Marles, the current Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

==History==

For most of the first seven decades after Federation, it was a marginal seat that frequently changed hands between the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties. However, Labor has held it without interruption since a 1967 by-election, and since the 1980s it has been one of Labor&#x27;s safest non-metropolitan seats. Presently, the Liberal Party need a near 13 percent swing to win it.

Its most prominent members have been Richard Casey, a leading Cabinet member in the 1930s and later Governor-General; John Dedman, a Chifley government minister; Hubert Opperman, a former cycling champion and a minister in the Menzies government; and Gordon Scholes, who was Speaker during the Whitlam government and a minister in the Hawke government.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division comprises an area of from the western shores of Port Phillip Bay, stretching to the north of Geelong and inland. Besides Geelong, it includes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ; and parts of , , , , , , and .

<doc id="1121929" wikidata="Q3522197" url="?curid=1121929" title="The Pearl (album)">
<text>The Pearl is the second collaborative studio album by Harold Budd and Brian Eno, released in August 1984 by Editions EG and produced by Eno and Daniel Lanois in Hamilton, Ontario. &quot;The Pearl&quot; is similar to Budd and Eno&#x27;s previous collaboration, &quot;Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror&quot; (1980), consisting mostly of subtly treated piano textures, but with more pronounced electronic treatments and nature recordings. The album has been well received by music critics, and is considered by some as a landmark work in ambient music.

== Production ==
&quot;The Pearl&quot; was recorded in Hamilton, Ontario in 1984 by Harold Budd, Brian Eno, and Daniel Lanois. The trio shared a house during the recording sessions and worked on the record seven days per week. The music was recorded over two weeks, and then it took 8-12 months to finish production and decide which tracks worked best together. The group had no set approach to working beyond looking for and capturing unique moments; such as &quot;Lost In The Humming Air&quot;, on which Budd improvised to humming noises by Brian Eno played on a Yamaha CS-80 and recorded in one take. In the case of &quot;Dark Eyed Sister&quot;, Budd recorded it at a small studio beforehand and sent to Eno to develop further; this, according to Budd, was the &quot;extreme version&quot; of how they worked. Eno made most of the decisions on aesthetics, spending hours working solo and recording pieces at different speeds. Pianos in the studio included an acoustic piano, as well as Yamaha and Rhodes electric pianos. For treatments, the group used a Yamaha DX7, CS-80, Casio CT-200, Casiotone 202, a Sequential Circuits Pro One, AMS digital delay, Eventide Harmonizer, and an EMT 250 plate reverb.

==Comparison with &quot;Ambient 2&quot;==
Budd believes both &quot;Ambient 2&quot; and &quot;The Pearl&quot; are similar in terms of sounds and timbres, and those similarities were conceived even during the onset of production. The former album was produced effortlessly, and the duo thought they could produce similar music again with ease. However, production on &quot;The Pearl&quot; was more challenging. Budd attributed this to naivety as a musical duo for &quot;Ambient 2&quot;, and explained that their musical language had matured since then, making production more difficult for &quot;The Pearl&quot;. In this sense, Budd believes &quot;The Pearl&quot; is more &quot;cohesive&quot; and &quot;focused&quot; than &quot;Ambient 2&quot;. He feels the conflicting emotions and &quot;artful confusion&quot; in the music make it more complicated and therefore more interesting to listen to.

== Critical reception ==

Contemporary reviews were positive. &quot;Electronics &amp; Music Maker&quot; felt &quot;The Pearl&quot; had more unity than &quot;Ambient 2&quot;, and enjoyed the peculiar mix of Eno&#x27;s melancholia and Budd&#x27;s optimism. &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; described how the album generates oceanic imagery, such as galleons at the bottom of the sea, waves on a deserted beach, and fish swimming silently.

Retrospective reviews have also been positive. Ned Raggett, writing for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, stated that &quot;&quot;The Pearl&quot; is so ridiculously good it instantly shows up much of the mainstream new age as the gloopy schlock that it often is&quot;. Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;These eleven pieces are more circumspect and detailed, and while they do slip into decoration they&#x27;re the most intellectually gratifying (and emotionally engaging) music Eno&#x27;s put his name on since his first Jon Hassell LP&quot;. A more critical review from &quot;Uncut&quot; described &quot;The Pearl&quot; the as &quot;overly tasteful abstraction that eventually proves tedious&quot; and a decorative, &quot;musical equivalent of a lava lamp&quot;.

&quot;Ambient 2&quot; and &quot;The Pearl&quot; are often discussed together by critics in retrospect as landmark works in ambient and both Eno and Budd&#x27;s repertoire. In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the albums earned them the title &quot;godfathers of ambient&quot;. &quot;All About Jazz&quot; called the albums &quot;some of the most beautiful music to come out of the early days of the genre&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; wrote that &quot;The Pearl&quot; built upon the sounds in &quot;Ambient 2&quot;, and described it as &quot;slow motion cocktail jazz through a padded wall and earmuffs&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described Budd and Eno&#x27;s collaborations as evoking tension &quot;between gentleness and threat, between intimacy and uncertainty, between the thrill of a hint and the human desire to see the whole picture&quot;.

<text>Bälinge IF is a sports club from Bälinge, a village 10 kilometres north-west of Uppsala, Sweden.

==Background==
Bälinge Idrottsförening was established on 15 March 1936 and is currently active in men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; football, cross-country skiing, floorball, and table tennis. In the past the club has also run an ice hockey section. In the first years of Bälinge IF&#x27;s history their sportsmen wore blue and yellow team colours. It was then decided that these colours could only be used by a Swedish national team so BIF had to switch to black and yellow.

Since 1942 Bälinge IF has participated mainly in the middle and lower divisions of the Swedish football league system. The club currently plays in Division 4 Uppland which is the sixth tier of Swedish football. They play their home matches at the Bälinge IP in Bälinge.

The club is most famous for its women&#x27;s football team which participated in the Women&#x27;s Premier Division (Damallsvenskan) for thirteen seasons since it was established in 1978. The team has never won the Swedish championships but it contributed with players to the Swedish national team, among these Josefine Öqvist who participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The team now play at a much lower level: in Division 4 Uppland.

Bälinge IF women&#x27;s football team played their home games at Studenternas IP Stadium in Uppsala, since the sports field in Bälinge was far too small to host premier games. The team colours are black and yellow.

Bälinge IF are affiliated to the Upplands Fotbollförbund.

<text>Martian Through Georgia is a 1962 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones, Maurice Noble (credited as a co-director), and Abe Levitow. The short was released on December 29, 1962.

==Plot==
The cartoon begins with a narrator describing the life of a bored Martian living in a perfect society on his planet. Uninterested in his advanced abilities and rejecting love, he seeks excitement elsewhere. Flying to Earth, he lands in Atlanta, where he is mistaken for a monster, leading to chaos and his imprisonment.

Confused, he tries to fit in but inadvertently causes havoc, believing he is destroying the supposed &quot;monster&quot;. Realizing he is the monster, he contemplates suicide until the narrator reminds him of love. He returns home, realizing he is loved, and finds happiness again. The narrator concludes that with love, no one will be bored on Mars.

<doc id="1121944" wikidata="Q1335150" url="?curid=1121944" title="Goodeidae">
<text>Goodeidae is a family of teleost fish endemic to Mexico and some areas of the United States. Many species are known as splitfins. This family contains about 50 species within 18 genera. The family is named after ichthyologist George Brown Goode (1851–1896).

The earliest fossil goodeid is &quot;Tapatia&quot;, a goodeine from the middle Miocene of Mexico. The earliest fossil empetrichthyine is &quot;Empetrichthys erdisi&quot; from the Miocene or Pliocene of California.

==Distribution==

The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Goodeinae and the Empetrichthyinae. The Goodeinae are endemic to shallow freshwater habitats in Mexico, particularly along the Mesa Central area (especially the Lerma River basin, smaller rivers directly south of it and inland to around the Valley of Mexico region), with some species found in brackish fringes at the Pacific coast, and north to central Durango, central Sinaloa and north San Luis Potosí. There are about 45 species of Goodeinae in 16 genera (some list 2 additional genera). The Empetrichthyinae are found in the southwestern Great Basin in Nevada, the United States, and contains 4 species in 2 genera.

==Physical information==

The name &quot;splitfin&quot; comes from the fact that, in the male fish, the anterior rays of the anal fin are partly separated from rest of the fin. Splitfins can be up to in length, though most species are much smaller, around . Goodeid fish have internal fertilisation, with males positioning themselves with a flexible part of the front anal fin, separated by a notch, which makes up the andropodium. Embryos hatch out of the egg within the ovarian follicle, and possess trophotaeniae, ribbon-like structures that emerge from the cloaca in front of the anal fin, on the ventral surface of the juvenile. These allow the absorption of nutrients within the ovary (matrotrophy), and are shed by juveniles shortly after birth. Female goodeids do not store sperm, and so a copulation event must precede each pregnancy.

==Conservation status==
In recent years there has been a significant reduction in the range and size of Goodeid populations in this region, mainly due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution, eutrophication, habitat modification and desiccation; recent estimates put habitat loss at 80% compared to historic ranges. The low economic importance of Goodeid fish to Mexican fisheries and industry has led to this family being largely ignored by conservation efforts, but their small size and the dedication of a small number of aquaria hobbyists has led to a recent increase in the amount of research dedicated to the family. These investigations have highlighted the implications for conservation efforts concerning other global freshwater ichthyofauna.

Several species are threatened or extinct according to the IUCN and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
* Vulnerable – bold characodon, darkedged splitfin, &quot;Goodea gracilis&quot;, &quot;Allotoca dugesii&quot;
* Endangered – bluetail splitfin, rainbow characodon, relict splitfin, &quot;Allotoca diazi&quot;, Manse Spring killifish
* Critically endangered – blackspot allotoca, Chapultepec splitfin, highland splitfin, Balsas splitfin, Tequila splitfin, butterfly splitfin
* Extinct in the wild – golden skiffia
* Extinct – Ash Meadows killifish, Parras characodon, Raycraft poolfish, Pahrump Ranch poolfish

==Life cycle and evolution==
The majority of Goodeid fish are viviparous, typically giving birth to live young. The family includes a number of popular aquarium fish, for example the redtail splitfin &quot;Xenotoca eiseni&quot;. Recent phylogenetic studies have put the age of this family at approximately 16.5 million years, with the majority of divergence occurring in the Miocene period. The speciosity of this family can be attributed to historical volcanic and geological disturbance in this region, which created suitable conditions for allopatric speciation of the fish.

==Genera==
The following genera are included in Goodeidae:

Subfamily Empetrichthyinae – springfishes and poolfishes
* &quot;Crenichthys&quot; – springfishes
* &quot;Empetrichthys&quot; – poolfishes

Subfamily Goodeinae – typical goodeids and splitfins
* &quot;Allodontichthys&quot;
* &quot;Alloophorus&quot; – Bulldog goodeid
* &quot;Allotoca&quot; – typical allotocas
* &quot;Ameca&quot; – Butterfly splitfin, butterfly goodeid
* &quot;Ataeniobius&quot; – Striped goodeid, bluetail goodea
* &quot;Chapalichthys&quot;
* &quot;Characodon&quot; – characodons
* &quot;Girardinichthys&quot;
* &quot;Goodea&quot;
* &quot;Hubbsina&quot;
* &quot;Ilyodon&quot;
* &quot;Skiffia&quot; – skiffias
* &quot;Xenoophorus&quot; – Relict splitfin
* &quot;Xenotaenia&quot; – Leopard splitfin
* &quot;Xenotoca&quot;
* &quot;Zoogoneticus&quot;

<text>Rete tubular ectasia, also known as cystic transformation of rete testis is a benign condition, usually found in older men, involving numerous small, tubular cystic structures within the rete testis.

==Presentation==
It is usually found in men older than 55 years and is frequently found on bilateral testes but is often asymmetrical.

==Mechanism==
The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the efferent ducts, which connect the rete testis with the head of the epididymis. They are often bilateral.

==Diagnosis==
The condition can be detected with ultrasonography. Cystic lesions us usually found at the mediastinum testis with elongated shaped lesions displacing the mediastinum. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as spermatocele, epididymal cyst, and epididymitis. The condition shares a common location with cystic dysplasia of the testis and intratesticular cysts. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don&#x27;t present specific tumor markers. Another distinguishing feature is that tubular ectasia of the testes is confined only to the mediastinum, unlike testicular cancer such as cystic teratoma of the testis which spreads throughout the testis.

==Treatment==
Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.

<doc id="1121948" wikidata="Q692259" url="?curid=1121948" title="Black Book of Carmarthen">
<text>The Black Book of Carmarthen () is thought to be the earliest surviving manuscript written solely in Welsh. The book dates from the mid-13th century; its name comes from its association with the Priory of St. John the Evangelist and Teulyddog at Carmarthen, and is referred to as black due to the colour of its binding. It is currently part of the collection of the National Library of Wales, where it is catalogued as NLW Peniarth MS 1.

This was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c.1592–1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts. It is believed that the manuscript is first recorded when it came into the possession of Sir John Price of Brecon (1502?–1555), whose work was to search the monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII. It was given to him by the treasurer of St David&#x27;s Cathedral, having come from Carmarthen Priory. &quot;Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin&quot; was described by William Forbes Skene (1809–92) as one of the Four Ancient Books of Wales.

==Description==
Written before 1250, the manuscript is a small (170 mm × 125 mm; 7 inches × 5 inches), incomplete, vellum codex of 54 folios (108 pages) in eight gatherings; several folios are missing. Although the product of a single scribe, inconsistency in the ruling of each folio, in the number of lines per folio, and in handwriting size and style, suggest an amateur writing over a long period of time. The opening folios, written in a large textura on alternating ruled lines, are followed by folios in a much smaller, cramped script.

===Contents===

The book contains a small group of triads about the horses of Welsh heroes, but is chiefly a collection of 9th–12th-century poetry falling into various categories: religious and secular subjects, and odes of praise and of mourning. Of greater interest are the poems which draw on traditions relating to the Welsh heroes associated with the Hen Ogledd (Old North, i.e. Cumbria and the surrounding area), and especially those connected with the legend of Arthur and Myrddin, known in later non-Welsh tradition as Merlin, thus predating the descriptions of Merlin by Geoffrey of Monmouth. One of the poems, &quot;The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin&quot;, refers to the &quot;Battle of Llongborth&quot;, the location of which can no longer be pinpointed, and mentions Arthur&#x27;s involvement in the battle.

The poems &quot;Yr Afallennau&quot; and &quot;Yr Oianau&quot; describe the mad Merlin in a forest talking to an apple tree and a pig, prophesying the success or failure of the Welsh army in battles with the Normans in south Wales.

Some of the other poems contained are:
*&quot;&quot; (A Conversation Between Merlin and Taliesin)
*Dadl y Corff a&#x27;r Enaid&quot; (Dialogue between the Body and the Soul)
*&quot;Elegy to Madog ap Maredudd&quot; (d. 1160)
*&quot;The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin&quot;
*&quot;The Verses of the Graves&quot;
*&quot;Kyntaw geir&quot; (a penitential poem on pilgrimage) 
*&quot;Gwerz Skolan&quot;

==Recent developments==
In 2002, it was announced that the Black Book had been scanned, and made available online.

In 2014 it was suggested an interactive display about the book could be created in Carmarthen&#x27;s St Peter&#x27;s Church.

In March 2015, University of Cambridge Professor Paul Russell and Ph.D. student Myriah Williams reported that a variety of imaging techniques such as ultraviolet lamps and photo-editing software had revealed content that had been invisible under normal viewing conditions. Among the previously unknown material, erased half a millennium ago, were extensive marginal annotations, including an inscription suggesting that the book was gifted by a previous owner to a family member; drawings of a fish and of two human faces; and a previously unattested Welsh poem.

<doc id="1121955" wikidata="Q1074059" url="?curid=1121955" title="Division of Deakin">
<text>The Division of Deakin is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1937, and was named in honour of Alfred Deakin, who served as Prime Minister of Australia on three non-consecutive occasions from 1903 to 1910. Deakin had represented the Victorian federal seat of Ballarat from 1901 to 1913.

Initially a rural seat, the division has been located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne since 1949, today taking in Bayswater North, Croydon, Croydon North, Croydon South, East Ringwood, Heatherdale, Heathmont, Kilsyth South, Mitcham, Ringwood, Vermont and Vermont South; it also covers parts of Croydon Hills, Forest Hill, Kilsyth, North Ringwood, Nunawading and Park Orchards. Vermont South includes Pin Oak Court, the cul-de-sac used as the filming location for Ramsay Street in the television soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Also part of the division&#x27;s boundaries are the nearby Nunawading Studios, where other scenes for the show have been shot.

Deakin has usually been held by the Liberal Party, though it became increasingly marginal from the 1980s onward. Prior to the 2013 federal election it was the second most marginal Labor Party seat in Australia. At the 2013 federal election, Michael Sukkar reclaimed the seat for the Liberal Party and was elected with 53.2% of the two-party-preferred vote.

At the time of the 2022 Australian federal election, approximately 10% of the electorate&#x27;s population possessed Chinese ancestry.

=== Original M20 model ===

Named after Poland&#x27;s capital city Warsaw, the Warszawa was until 1957 identical to the Soviet Pobeda, built under license, which was given to Poland by GAZ at Joseph Stalin&#x27;s insistence. The engine was the same, side-valve M-20 unit as used in the Pobeda, producing . Exports of the car started in 1954 to countries such as Romania, China, Bulgaria and Albania. In 1956 work began on the development of a new four-speed gearbox. However, it failed in practice and its development was suspended. In the same year, work began on an overhead valve engine that could be used to drive the car. This engine was a copy of the Étendard engine used on the Renault Frégate, and started being put on Warszawa models in 1962. The first major modernization took place in 1957. The new model was called FSO Warszawa M20 model 57, but not long after its name was changed to Warszawa 200. The new model received a restyled front-end section. The powertrain was modified too, the compression ratio was raised from 6.2:1 to 6.8:1 and maximum power crept up to .

=== Later 223 and 224 model ===

From 1962 on, the car was equipped with the new OHV inline-four engine with power increased to . This was much more modern than the archaic sidevalve construction used before. In 1964 the body style was changed to a ponton, three-box design by then becoming mainstream in Europe, though the car retained a rather heavy style to western eyes.

In 1967 it was announced that Perkins&#x27; four-cylinder, 1.76-litre diesel engines would be fitted in export market Warszawas, which were scheduled to debut at the Poznań International Fair in June 1967. On the same year, the smaller Polski Fiat 125p based on the Italian Fiat 125 entered production and the Warszawa gradually stopped being produced with the last one coming off the assembly line in 1973, with the 125p serving as its successor.

== Modifications ==
The Warszawa was the basis for two rigid panel vans, the Żuk (made from 1958 to 1997) and the Nysa (made from 1958 to 1994). The gearbox, clutch, and chassis of the Warszawa were also used in the FSR Tarpan. These vehicles led to the basic chassis of the Warszawa being produced until the 1990s. Additionally, there was a commercial variant of the saloon car.
=== Warszawa Pickup ===

Development on a pickup (technically coupe utility) version of the Warszawa was undertaken in response to the demand of Polish cyclists who wanted a light delivery vehicle to transport their bikes including spare parts for mechanics. The pickup could carry two people and an additional 500 kg payload in the back. Several hundred pickups were produced annually, but their production was generally limited compared to other models. In the next years, the pickup underwent the same modernizations as passenger versions and was sold almost exclusively to state-owned enterprises and institutions. The maximum speed for the 223P version was 120 km / h, and for the 224P – 105 km / h.

The speedometer indicated that the speed should not be exceeded 70 km / h with the vehicle fully loaded. The truck bed was equipped with an opening tailgate suspended on the lower edge, the side boards were fixed. The floor of the loading space was made of pine boards, and was additionally secured with a tarpaulin spread over an upper steel body.
=== Warszawa Van ===

A commercial van model was also produced, making the concept similar to the contemporary sedan delivery. This modification was called Warszawa 201F (The F standing for Furgon). The car was equipped with two doors, the fuel tank was moved under the driver&#x27;s seat, the spare wheel was placed under the floor at the rear of the body, which resulted in a relatively large usable area. Access to the cargo space was possible through a two-piece rear hatch, the individual parts of which were hung on the lower and upper edge of the door opening. The car&#x27;s suspension was reinforced although it only had the payload capacity of 400 kg compared to the 500 kg of the pickup version. A version with side glasses was also produced and was used as an ambulance regularly.

In 1964, production of the modernized 203F and 204F models began. Modernization of the body was limited to the front part only. The other changes were the same as in the passenger versions. In 1965, the van models were withdrawn from the market due to the commencement of production of Warsaw 203-K / 204-K with a station wagon body.
=== Warszawa station wagon ===

In June 1965 during the Poznań International Fair, a station wagon version of the Warszawa was presented. The new models were called the 203-K and 204-K (later changed to 223-K and 224-K) and entered mass production at the end of the same year. The design of the body was developed by Cezary Nawrot, while the technical development was made by a team of employees of the Body Design Office, under the supervision of Eng. Stanisław Łukaszewicz.

Compared to the sedan version, the roof was extended and the luggage compartment glazing was installed above the rear fenders. The station wagon version was additionally equipped with a fixed roof rack with a load capacity of 40 kg, reinforced suspension and wider tires. The top speed of the 223-K version was 128 km / h, and for the 224-K – 115 km / h.
=== Draisine ===

A draisine of the Warszawa was also produced and was used by the Polish State Railways, mainly for field trips for inspections. Production of this variant was between 1956–1973. Most draisines were sedan models although pickup models were also built. A small number of station wagons were also built for export markets. The steering system was made for driving straight ahead, and a turntable was mounted under the chassis (a screw jack was used to rotate the trolley on the track, after it was lifted, in order to allow driving in both directions at full speed). With further changes, the rear light was modified (red lights at the front instead of the direction indicators and white light at the rear instead of the stop), the brushes in front of the wheels were installed and the suspension was tied with steel cables (to facilitate lifting the car). The maximum speed was , but due to the long braking distance on the track, PKP regulations then limited it to .

The exact number of draisines produced is not known, but together with export production but it is estimated that only 200 of these vehicles were ever produced. These draisines were also exported to Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. In Hungary, a copy of the Warszawa draisine was also built with advanced changes. These draisines were regularly used in both Poland and export markets until the mid-1990s when they were massively taken off service and scrapped, which leads to only a few handful draisines surviving to this today. Moreover, in recent years, several cars have been independently adapted to non-original draisines by collectors.

=== Police car ===

A police car version of the Warszawa was also produced for the Milicja Obywatelska and the Polish army. The last such batch was built in 1972.

The police car was based on the civilian version. However, it differed in painting (white or cream body with a blue stripe and Milicja or MO markings), a blue light signal mounted on the roof, and a two-tone siren. Additionally, matte rear and side windows were installed.

The police car received the same modernizations as the civilian and commercial models. How many police cars were produced has never been officially stated since it is likely that as these cars were intended for state purposes, production was never taken in records of how many police vehicles were built or registered.

In comparison to the special ordered GAZ M20-Pobeda for the KGB, this version retained the four-cylinder engine of the Warszawa, as the passenger and commercial models had.

=== FSO Warszawa 210 ===

A prototype called the Warszawa 210 was built in 1964. It had a 6-cylinder engine and a more modern body reminiscent of then-current car trends in Europe, although it still had the old Pobeda-derived chassis.

== Export ==

Exports of the Warszawa started in 1954. By 1973, 72,834 copies were sent to export markets. The Warszawa was exported to 25 countries located on five continents, and the recipients of the largest number of cars were the countries of the Eastern Bloc. According to some sources, the number of cars sent abroad amounts to 81,804 units, which is due to the fact that 8,970 units sold in Poland as part of internal export are included in the statistics.

== End Of Production ==

By the time the Warszawa started production it was already largely outdated since the Pobeda on which it was based on started production in 1946 and had technical features derived from the 1938 Opel Kapitän. Despite successive modernizations over time, the body looked increasingly outdated. From 1965, plans were made to introduce a successor to the outdated Warszawa. Two variants were options, the first was the production of new FSO products – the Warszawa 210 and Syrena 110, and the second was the purchase of a license for a modern foreign model. The second option was chosen, and negotiations with Renault and Fiat began. The French offer was rejected due to unfavorable conditions; Fiat offered the Poles the 1300/1500 model, but the model was considered too small to replace the Warszawa.

Nevertheless, FSO choose Fiat to partner with and decided that the larger Fiat 125 was more suitable as a successor, although the Polish version still used the lower-cost mechanics of the 1300/1500. Production of the Warszawa continued until late 1973; by that time it utilized many parts from the Polski Fiat 125p. The more compact and modern 125p sold much better than the Warszawa, particularly in export markets.

<doc id="1121963" wikidata="Q919127" url="?curid=1121963" title="Mieczysław Weinberg">
<text>Mieczysław Weinberg (December 8, 1919 – February 26, 1996) was a Polish, Soviet, and Russian composer and pianist. Born in Warsaw to parents who worked in the Yiddish theatre in Poland, his early years were surrounded by music. He taught himself to play the piano at a young age and eventually became skilled enough to substitute for his father as a conductor at Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish Theatre. During this period, he began to compose. At the age of 12, he started formal music lessons and soon thereafter enrolled at the Warsaw Conservatory. He studied piano with Józef Turczyński, who considered him and Witold Małcużyński as one of his best students. In 1938, Weinberg played for Josef Hofmann, who offered to teach him at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Weinberg declined, because he preferred to focus on composition instead; the invasion of Poland that initiated World War II in 1939 also made it impossible for him to accept. As the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; advanced on Warsaw, Weinberg left his parents behind and fled with his sister towards the Soviet border. Discomfort forced his sister to turn back in mid-journey—he never saw her or the rest of his family again. During his only subsequent visit to Poland in 1966, he learned that his family had been murdered at the Trawniki concentration camp.

Weinberg took refuge in the Soviet Union, where he officially adopted a Russified version of his name. He settled first in Minsk, where he studied composition with Vasily Zolotarev, then in Tashkent. It was in that city that Weinberg met and married Natalya Mikhoels, the daughter of the actor Solomon Mikhoels. From there, Weinberg sent a copy of his Symphony No. 1 to Dmitri Shostakovich through an intermediary, which resulted in an official invitation from the Committee on the Arts to come to Moscow. Upon arriving in the capital, Weinberg successfully established himself as a composer.

Changes in Soviet cultural policy in the postwar led to increased repression against minority groups, including Jews. This led to on the orders of Stalin in 1948. Although Weinberg&#x27;s music was praised by critics and colleagues—including Tikhon Khrennikov, general secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers—and continued to be played, he was surveilled and harassed by the MVD. On February 6, 1953, Weinberg was arrested; he was jailed at Lubyanka Prison. Intercession on his behalf by Shostakovich to Lavrenty Beria and Stalin&#x27;s death led to Weinberg&#x27;s release on April 25. For the next few years, he focused his efforts on music for film and stage. By the end of the 1950s, he turned his attention again to concert music. He experienced his greatest professional success in the 1960s, when his music was played by musicians such as Rudolf Barshai, the Borodin Quartet, Timofei Dokschitzer, Mikhail Fichtenholz, Leonid Kogan, Kirill Kondrashin, and Mstislav Rostropovich, among others. His score for Fyodor Khitruk&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; was an immediate success; the verses sung by its titular character entered the Russian popular lexicon. Weinberg later said that its music had contributed the most to the preservation of his legacy.

In the mid-1960s, Weinberg began an extramarital affair with Olga Rakhalskaya, daughter of the psychiatrist , that quickly developed into a romantic relationship; they married in 1972. Starting in this period, his personal life stabilized and was dominated mostly by work. His concert music was played with less frequency as many of its former exponents had left the Soviet Union, severed their friendships with Weinberg, or died. He acquired a few new advocates, including Maxim Shostakovich and Vladimir Fedoseyev. Despite being awarded the People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR in 1980, shifts in musical tastes and chronic health problems led to the neglect of Weinberg&#x27;s music. He continued to compose prolifically through the 1980s, but Crohn&#x27;s disease and the collapse of the Soviet Union had immediate adverse consequences for him and his output. The loss of state patronage and healthcare prevented him from receiving treatment for his broken hip in late 1992, which left him homebound, and eventually bedridden. Belated recognition of his music outside of Russia began in the 1990s through the advocacy of Tommy Persson, a Swedish judge. In 1994, Poland awarded Weinberg the Meritorious Activist of Culture. After consultations with his wife in late 1995, he converted to Orthodox Christianity a few weeks before his death on February 26, 1996.

==Spelling and transliteration of name==
Weinberg&#x27;s name was registered on his birth certificate as Mojsze Wajnberg. Throughout his adult life, he signed his letters in Polish using the Polish spelling of his surname. During his career in the Yiddish theater of interwar Warsaw, he was known by the German spelling of his name, Mosze Weinberg; a typical convention of the time for Polish musicians who aspired to produce recordings for export. Weinberg adopted the given name Mieczysław professionally at the beginning of his musical career because he believed it sounded more Polish and prestigious.

In the Soviet Union, he was officially known as Moisei Samuilovich Vainberg (). The name was the result of legal expediency and his personal indifference when he sought to cross the border into the Soviet Union in 1939:

The order came to let the refugees in. Some kind of squad was put together to examine the documents, but quite carelessly, because there were a lot of people. When they came up to me, I was asked: &quot;Last name?&quot;—&quot;Weinberg&quot;—&quot;First?&quot;—&quot;Mieczysław&quot;—&quot;&#x27;Mieczysław&#x27;, what is that? You Jewish?&quot;—&quot;Jewish&quot;—&quot;So &#x27;Moisei&#x27; you will be&quot;.

In the 1980s, he successfully petitioned to have his legal first name changed back to Mieczysław (). Among friends in Russia, he would also go by his Polish diminutive &quot;Mietek&quot;.

Re-transliteration of the composer&#x27;s surname from Cyrillic back into the Latin alphabet produces a variety of spellings. &quot;Vainberg&quot; became the most common in the 1990s because of a series of compact disc releases on the Olympia label. Per Skans, the author of their liner notes, had erroneously believed that this was the composer&#x27;s favored choice. Starting in the 21st century, &quot;Weinberg&quot; became the most widespread spelling. However, there is no evidence that the composer preferred that spelling.

==Biography==
===Youth===

Weinberg was born in Warsaw on December 8, 1919. His father, , was a well-known conductor, composer, and violinist at the Jewish Theatre in Warsaw. He had originally come from Kishinev, Bessarabia Governorate (today part of Moldova), which he left shortly before its Jewish community was attacked in the pogrom of 1903, in the course of which Weinberg&#x27;s grandparents and great-grandparents were killed. Weinberg&#x27;s mother, Sara (&quot;née&quot; Sura Dwojra Sztern or Sara Deborah Stern), was Szmuel&#x27;s second wife. She had been born in Odessa, Kherson Governorate (today part of Ukraine), and was an actress in several Yiddish theater companies in Warsaw and Łódź. One of the composer&#x27;s cousins, Isay Abramovich Mishne, was the secretary of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the , and was executed in 1918 along with the other 26 Baku Commissars.

The Weinberg&#x27;s family home was located in the Wola district, on . From an early age, Weinberg was surrounded by music; he later said that &quot;life was [his] first music teacher&quot;. At the age of six, he began to accompany his father to musical performances. He taught himself to play the piano at an early age and eventually developed sufficient skill to substitute for his father as conductor at the Jewish Theatre. Weinberg also began to compose, although he did not accord these early works importance:

What does writing music mean to a child? I simply took down one of my father&#x27;s music sheets and scribbled down something or other... But in this way, I studied music right from my birth, as it were. And when I wrote these &quot;operettas&quot; I probably imagined myself to be a composer.
At the age of 12, Weinberg began formal music lessons at a school in Warsaw. His teacher noted his precocity and enrolled him at the Warsaw Conservatory in October 1931, where she felt his talent would be more suitably developed. The identities of Weinberg&#x27;s teachers during his first two years at the conservatory are no longer known, but in 1933 he became a student of Józef Turczyński, who considered Weinberg to be one of his best students along with Witold Małcużyński. Weinberg graduated in 1939.

Weinberg made his professional debut in a chamber concert organized by the Polish Society for Contemporary Music on December 10, 1936, wherein he was the pianist for the world premiere of Andrzej Panufnik&#x27;s Piano Trio. His next appearance was in mid-1937, as one of the musicians that performed at the conservatory&#x27;s annual graduation concert. The students who received diplomas at the event included Witold Lutosławski, Stefan Kisielewski, and Zbigniew Turski. The latter&#x27;s Piano Concerto was included on the concert program; Weinberg was the soloist. A reviewer praised him as the best performer at the concert and described his playing as &quot;truly manly&quot;. That same year, Weinberg also composed music for an early film by , &quot;&quot;, in which he made a brief appearance as a pianist. The film also included songs by his father, who may have conducted the ensemble used for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In May 1938, Weinberg was introduced by Turczyński to his friend, the pianist Josef Hofmann, who held the post of honorary professor at the conservatory and who was then touring Poland. Weinberg played for him Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Italian Concerto&quot; and Mily Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot;. Impressed, Hofmann invited Weinberg to study with him at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, for which he promised to obtain an American visa. Ultimately, Weinberg decided to pursue a career as a composer rather than pianist. In the event, he was unable to accept Hofmann&#x27;s offer because of the invasion of Poland in 1939; Weinberg referred to this as having marked the end of &quot;the best and happiest period&quot; of his life.

===Escape from Poland===

Despite the outbreak of war, Weinberg maintained his daily routine and believed the assurances of Polish propaganda that Poland would emerge victorious against Germany&#x27;s invasion. Late night on September 6, 1939, Weinberg returned home from the Café Adria, where he worked as a pianist. As he ate the meal that his mother had prepared for him, he heard a radio announcement from Roman Umiastowski that the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had broken through Polish defenses and urged all able-bodied men to join the Polish Army. The broadcast set off a panic in Warsaw. The next morning, Weinberg left with his sister and headed eastwards towards the Soviet Union. In mid-journey, his sister decided to return home because her shoes were badly hurting her feet. Weinberg never saw her and his parents again. It was not until 1966, during his only subsequent trip to Poland, that he learned from surviving former neighbors that his family had been murdered at the Trawniki concentration camp.

Weinberg&#x27;s trek to the Soviet Union took him seventeen days. He escaped wartime dangers along the way, but witnessed other refugees who did not and died. One incident occurred near the Soviet–Polish border:

Two or three Jews were walking along the road; their clothing revealed that they were Jews. In that moment, a motorcycle came along. A German got off and, from the gesticulation, we understood that he was asking for the way somewhere. They showed him precisely... He probably said &quot;Danke schön&quot;, sat down again, started the engine, and as the Jews resumed walking, to send them on their way he threw a hand grenade, which tore them to shreds. I could have easily died the same way. On the whole, dying was easy.

On October 3, Weinberg arrived at the border. He recalled the gratitude that he and other refugees felt and that they &quot;blessed the Red Army which could save [them] from death&quot;.

===Refugee in the Soviet Union===

Weinberg arrived in the Soviet Union with few personal belongings aside from some of his musical manuscripts and family photographs. His poor health excluded him from consideration for military service. It is believed that before he settled in Minsk, he first journeyed through Brest, then Pinsk, and Luninets; he composed his Piano Sonata No. 1 in the latter town, which he nicknamed the work after. Weinberg and other recent Polish immigrants were granted Soviet citizenship by local authorities in Minsk. This permitted him the privilege to enroll at the Minsk Conservatory. He became one of Vasily Zolotarev&#x27;s composition students. Weinberg also studied counterpoint, music history, harmony, orchestration, and conducting. His classmates included Eta Tyrmand, , and . According to , Weinberg was considered the best student. He settled into a room at the conservatory&#x27;s dormitory. His roommate was , a pianist and alumnus of Heinrich Neuhaus. Klumov gave lessons in the Russian language to Weinberg, who quickly became fluent. After school, Weinberg worked as a pianist. He sometimes partnered in duet with Tyrmand, with whom he played medleys of themes from popular American films.

Zolotarev had been taught composition by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and, through him, inherited the traditions of the Mighty Handful, particularly their use of folk music idioms. In turn, Weinberg absorbed these influences and began turning to Jewish folklore and music for inspiration. Pleased at the young man&#x27;s abilities, Zolotarev described Weinberg as &quot;a charming and handsome young man, very (extraordinarily) talented&quot;. Concern for Weinberg&#x27;s health and finances led Zolotarev to solicit help for him from the Committee on the Arts. This led to Weinberg being sent to Moscow as one of the participating delegates for the Festival of Byelorussian Art in June 1940. Through Klumov, Weinberg was introduced to Nikolai Myaskovsky:

I remember how astonished I was [at meeting Myaskovsky], this first impression stayed with me my whole life. I was twenty years old back then and he was in his fifties, I think. He seemed a little old man to me. As I made to leave, he suddenly picked up my coat and helped me. I was completely dumbfounded and my hands trembled: &quot;What are you doing, what are you doing?&quot; And he uttered a famous phrase to me: &quot;That is how we do things around here&quot;.

On June 22, 1941, the Germans began their invasion of the Soviet Union. All men were ordered to report to local military offices for duty. Weinberg was again exempted from military service, with his Pott&#x27;s disease cited as the reason. On July 23, he received his diploma from the conservatory; it was signed by Vissarion Shebalin, the chairman of the Moscow branch of the Union of Soviet Composers. Along with his diploma, Weinberg gathered his manuscripts and family photographs, then fled Minsk with his friend Klumov. Although Weinberg was initially refused permission to leave by the authorities, he obtained forged documents from Klumov that certified him as a music teacher. With these he was able to travel as far as his finances permitted—to Tashkent in the Uzbek SSR. Most of the State Symphony Orchestra of the Byelorussian SSR musicians who had not been able to leave Minsk were killed in the subsequent German bombing and capture of the city.

===Tashkent===
Circumstances in Tashkent during the Great Patriotic War were difficult. The first wave of refugees who arrived in the city found plenteous food and places to live. This gave rise to a popular saying at the time, &quot;Tashkent has bread in abundance&quot;. As the war progressed, however, nationwide supply shortages and a growing population of evacuees from elsewhere in the Soviet Union strained the city&#x27;s resources. Housing and food became scarce; crime rates soared. The sight of people dead in the street from starvation was not uncommon.

In spite of these challenges, when Weinberg and Klumov disembarked in Taskent in July 1941, they were determined to secure employment and ration cards for themselves. With his skills as a piano soloist and ensemble player, as well as composer, Weinberg was in an advantageous position. He was quickly hired by the Uzbek SSR State Opera and Ballet Theatre as a tutor and &quot;répétiteur&quot;. Later, through his friendship with the Uzbek composer Tokhtasyn Dzhalilov, Weinberg was engaged to work jointly with Klumov and four other Uzbek composers on the creation of &quot;The Sword of Uzbekistan&quot;, a socialist realist opera with Uzbek folk music themes. They counted among their collaborators Mutal Burhonov, who in 1947 composed the &quot;Anthem of the Uzbek SSR&quot; (later adapted as the &quot;State Anthem of Uzbekistan&quot;). The opera, whose plot combined Uzbek national myths that were modified to support the Soviet war effort, has since been lost.

On August 4, 1941, while work proceeded on the opera, Weinberg attended a party hosted by Flora Syrkina, the second wife of the artist Alexander Tyshler. It was there that Weinberg met Natalya Mikhoels, the daughter of Solomon Mikhoels, the actor and director of GOSET. Weinberg married Natalya in 1942. They moved into a dormitory on the campus of Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek SSR, which they shared with Mikhoels and his wife. Weinberg&#x27;s marriage into the family of Mikhoels, who was then at the peak of his career as leader of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, significantly improved the composer&#x27;s social and financial standing. He intensely admired and respected his father-in-law, to whom he dedicated his Violin Sonata No. 1 composed in 1943. In turn, Mikhoels strove to find any information for Weinberg about the fate of his family, but was unsuccessful. It was only through a meeting with the trumpeter Eddie Rosner, a fellow Polish immigrant who was touring Tashkent and had also played at the Café Adria before the war, that he learned his family had been deported from Warsaw by train to an unknown destination. This would be all Weinberg knew about his family&#x27;s fate until 1966.

Weinberg composed his Symphony No. 1 in late 1942; he dedicated it to the Red Army. Despite being unperformed in public until 1967, the work was of decisive importance in Weinberg&#x27;s life. Around the time of the symphony&#x27;s composition, the faculty of the Leningrad Conservatory was evacuated to Tashkent. Israel Finkelstein, a former teaching assistant to Shostakovich, met Weinberg and was greatly impressed by his music. Afterwards, Finkelstein conveyed his opinions on Weinberg to Shostakovich. His enthusiasm provoked Shostakovich&#x27;s curiosity, who requested to see some of Weinberg&#x27;s scores. Another member of the conservatory staff, Yuri Levitin, a former Shostakovich pupil, also befriended Weinberg in Tashkent. It was to him that Weinberg consigned a copy of his Symphony No. 1 to give to Shostakovich. Weinberg may have also been assisted by Mikhoels, who had a friendly relationship with the composer. A few weeks later, Weinberg received an official invitation from the Committee on the Arts to come to Moscow.

===Wartime success===
Weinberg&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 was performed in September 1943 for the Union of Soviet Composers. Myaskovsky was among those who heard the work; he described it as &quot;talented, technically fine, but without warmth&quot;. Weinberg and his family arrived in Moscow in October. They briefly settled into an apartment on Tverskoy Boulevard, where his father-in-law Mikhoels had lived prior to the war, before they moved into another home on Nikitsky Boulevard. On October 3, the couple&#x27;s only child, Viktoria, was born; her name was symbolic of their hope for Soviet victory in the war.

According to Weinberg&#x27;s later reminiscences, he first met Shostakovich in person in October. He was received at the latter&#x27;s apartment located on . Waiting with Shostakovich was his friend, the musicologist and arts critic Ivan Sollertinsky. Weinberg played for them a piano reduction of his Symphony No. 1, to which Shostakovich replied with a few appreciative comments. The meeting established a friendship between the composers that endured until Shostakovich&#x27;s death. Weinberg thereafter was entrusted as a partner in many of the first hearings of Shostakovich&#x27;s orchestral music in reductions for piano four-hands. Soon after this meeting, Weinberg was accepted into the Union of Soviet Composers. The benefits he received as a member permitted him to focus on composing full-time, as well as allowed him access to food and products unobtainable to ordinary Soviet citizens. Weinberg&#x27;s newfound comfort, which contrasted sharply with his financial and professional standing in prewar Poland, also coincided with a gradual return to normalcy in everyday Soviet life.

By the time the Soviet Union emerged victorious in the war against Germany in 1945, Weinberg&#x27;s career appeared to be headed in an auspicious direction.

===Postwar===
The announcement that proclaimed the Allied victory in Europe was broadcast over all radio stations in the Soviet Union on the night of May 9, 1945. Weinberg and his family were at the Mikhoels home when they heard the news. Weinberg&#x27;s wife said that she ran downstairs to tell her father. He replied:

&quot;It is not enough to win the war. Now the world will need to be won and that is much more difficult&quot;. With those words, he cooled our elation; and we would have the chance to see how much truth there was in his words for the rest of our lives.

Weinberg&#x27;s professional reputation continued to increase in the immediate postwar period. He was in demand as both composer and performer. He was also chosen by Kara Karayev, Nikolai Peiko, and Yuri Shaporin, among others, to perform in premieres of their new works. As a composer he was supported by Shostakovich and Myaskovsky.

Beyond these personal successes, major shifts in Soviet cultural policy were taking place. Increased repression and marginalization of minority groups was signaled in 1946 when Jewish candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were pressured to withdraw. Andrei Zhdanov led campaigns against formalism in the fields of literature and film in 1946; this resulted in the censure of Anna Akhmatova, Mikhail Zoshchenko, and Sergei Eisenstein. From October 2 to 8, a smaller campaign took place within the Union of Soviet Composers. Under the guises of encouraging composers to seek &quot;more creative guidance&quot; and to develop &quot;closer ties between Soviet composers and Soviet reality&quot;, the campaign was designed to subjugate Soviet music to the purposes of propaganda. Lev Knipper took the stage to admonish Weinberg and Jānis Ivanovs at one of the meetings:

A slackening of bonds between formal mastery and richness of ideas... This is a dangerous tendency. Our youth has to learn from the elder generation about the importance of ideology.

Shaporin, Shostakovich, and Aram Khachaturian reacted by defending Weinberg. Instead, they urged, he needed the assistance of his colleagues to bring his musical style into alignment with the expectations of Soviet officialdom. Khachaturian expanded on this point by saying that critics who had praised Weinberg had done him a disservice by not balancing their views with diagnoses of his shortcomings. He also implored Weinberg to explore his &quot;national melos&quot;, which the Armenian composer remarked was used &quot;extremely rarely&quot;.

In spite of this suggestion, Weinberg showed little interest in exploring folk music idioms. Excepting his &quot;Festive Pictures&quot; for orchestra, the music he composed immediately after these remarks, instead, continued to pursue and refine stylistic traits that he had established during the war. Other works that may have reflected his acceptance of Khachaturian&#x27;s advice are now partially or entirely lost.

===Persecution and arrest===
On January 5, 1948, Joseph Stalin and members of the Politburo attended the Bolshoi Theatre for a performance of the opera &quot;The Great Friendship&quot; by the Georgian composer Vano Muradeli. For reasons that are unknown, the opera outraged Stalin, who immediately directed Andrei Zhdanov to organize a wider and renewed campaign against musical formalism. A few days later, on January 12, Weinberg&#x27;s father-in-law on the orders of Stalin. The actor had been lured to his death by the critic and covert MVD informant, ; both were killed in what was officially ruled a traffic accident. Mikhoels&#x27; body was returned to Moscow and given a state funeral. Lazar Kaganovich surreptitiously conveyed to Weinberg&#x27;s family his condolences, but urged them not to inquire any further about the actor&#x27;s death. Weinberg was placed under constant MVD surveillance, regularly harassed by the police, and had his travel privileges curtailed.

Meanwhile, the ongoing anti-formalist campaign in music necessitated a convocation of the Union of Soviet Composers. Tikhon Khrennikov, who was appointed general secretary of the union, led the proceedings, but refused to engage in anti-Semitic tactics. This resulted in a number of anonymous letters accusing him of having sold out the interests of Soviet culture. On February 10, the Politburo published its &quot;&quot; in &quot;Pravda&quot;. This was followed on February 14 by a ruling that listed composers and works banned from performance. Although Weinberg was not one of the six composers who were the campaign&#x27;s most prominent targets, his music for children was censured. He was also further compromised professionally by his association with Shostakovich, who had been among the six denounced composers.

In spite of these developments, Weinberg appeared to have no cause for concern about his personal welfare. One of his works, the Sinfonietta No. 1, was received warmly by the press. It was also praised by Khrennikov after it was performed at the December 1948 plenum of the Union of Composers:

Shining evidence of the fruitfulness of the path to realism is to be found in the Sinfonietta by Weinberg, a composer who used to be under the powerful influence of modernistic art which distorted his unquestionable talent in an ugly way. Turning to the sources of Jewish folk music, Weinberg has created a brilliant work full of &quot;joie de vivre&quot; and devoted to the joyous, free working life of Jewish people in the Land of Socialism. In this work Weinberg has revealed outstanding skill and richness of imagination.

The work soon established itself as a part of the Soviet orchestral repertoire and was one of Weinberg&#x27;s most played works through the mid-1950s. Another work, the cantata &quot;In My Native Land&quot;, which set texts that glorified Stalin, was conducted by Alexander Gauk. Weinberg also composed a number of other populist works during the late 1940s, but suppressed them from being performed. Other works, like the Violin Sonatina composed for Leonid Kogan, were only first played years later. Much of Weinberg&#x27;s energies in these years were devoted to music for films and the circus; the latter was considered by the Soviet government to be second only to the film industry in importance.

Around Weinberg, official persecution of Jews intensified. In November 1948, the government dissolved the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and arrested several of its members. Benjamin Zuskin, Mikhoels&#x27; successor at GOSET, was arrested in February 1950. He was interrogated by authorities about Weinberg, but told them he knew little except that he knew he was a composer, one of Shostakovich&#x27;s friends, and that Khrennikov considered him a &quot;formalist&quot;. Zuskin&#x27;s arrest led Weinberg and his wife to believe that their arrest would soon follow. One of his wife&#x27;s relatives, Miron Vovsi, was arrested in late January 1953 and accused of being one of the conspirators in the &quot;doctors&#x27; plot&quot;.

On February 6, Weinberg attended a performance of his &quot;Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes&quot; in an arrangement for violin and orchestra played by David Oistrakh. After the concert, Weinberg went back to his home for a late night meal accompanied by Nikolai Peiko, Boris Tchaikovsky, and his wife. At 2:00 a.m., the police arrived with an arrest warrant for Weinberg. He got dressed, stated to his friends that he was innocent, and surrendered himself into police custody. His office was sealed and his apartment was searched until the morning. Fear of torture impelled him to admit culpability to whatever charges he was accused of, irrespective of their plausibility. These included accusations of digging a tunnel to England under his home in order to flee the country. His wife inquired regularly with officials at the Lubyanka Prison to determine Weinberg&#x27;s state and to ensure that he was alive. She was soon contacted by Shostakovich, who informed her that he vouched for Weinberg&#x27;s innocence in a personal letter to Lavrenty Beria. Shostakovich also arranged to assume power of attorney over the Weinbergs&#x27; affairs and the responsibility of raising their daughter in the event that Natalya was also arrested. Matters changed course after Stalin&#x27;s death on March 5, an event which Weinberg did not learn of until weeks later. He was released from jail on April 25.

===Khrushchev Thaw===

Following the composition of the Overture for orchestra soon after his release from prison, Weinberg temporarily shifted his creative efforts away from concert works. Those that he did compose tended to be chamber music, which by their relative economy of resources were more likely to be performed. Instead, he concentrated on composing music for films and cartoons. His score for the 1954 film &quot;Tiger Girl&quot;, starring Lyudmila Kasatkina in the title role, became successful enough that he extracted an orchestral suite for concert performances. The resulting suite became one of his most often performed works, with only the &quot;Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes&quot; exceeding it in popularity. Another successful film score was the one he composed for &quot;The Last Inch&quot;, a drama directed by and ; the music secured the film its enduring fame in Russia. The writer Mikhail Veller, who saw the film in his childhood, recalled it and its music:

It [sent] chills down my spine, needles pricking me in the chest and knees, a spasm in my throat, tears in my eyes, hope, grim delight, and joy. We could not know the word &quot;catharsis&quot;. I do not think you can comprehend what it meant to a nine-year-old to see &quot;The Last Inch&quot; for the first time: in the Soviet Union, behind the Iron Curtain, without television, virtually no radio, without any commercials, and in totalitarian-filtered austerity; everything is Soviet, nothing is foreign, imported, capitalist, unfamiliar, in this rarefied space—a movie theatre. It was a revelation, a shock, a bitter tragedy with an exalted conclusion that was ripped from destiny. It was a song we all sang. Soon a record came out and I bought it. Music by Weinberg, lyrics by The bass, a soloist with the Kiev Philharmonic Orchestra, . The harps (!) began to strum, the basses entered, and a piano solo rattled the nerves at the heights of its passages.

His most notable feature film music success was his score to the 1957 war drama by Mikhail Kalatozov, &quot;The Cranes are Flying&quot;. A contemporary Soviet film encyclopedia praised Weinberg for the skill and precision with which he used his music, which it described as being guided by &quot;dreams, love, and hope&quot;. The score, which includes a sequence for piano and orchestra in the style of Richard Addinsell&#x27;s &quot;Warsaw Concerto&quot;, became so popular in the Soviet Union that there was great demand for arrangements of it in various styles.

Weinberg also composed incidental music for a theatrical production of Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Les Ressources de Quinola&quot;. Some of Weinberg&#x27;s notable concert works of the period include his Piano Sonata No. 4, Partita, and Violin Sonata No. 5, the latter dedicated to Shostakovich.

As a pianist, Weinberg was involved as one of the principal figures in the dissemination and early reception of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 10 in 1954. Weinberg first played it with the composer in an arrangement for piano four-hands for selected staff and students at the Moscow Conservatory. They later played it for Yevgeny Mravinsky, who subsequently conducted the symphony&#x27;s premiere, and then for a session in April of the Leningrad branch of the RSFSR Union of Composers. At the latter performance, the symphony provoked intense debate, to which Weinberg replied in its defense. That same year, Weinberg and Shostakovich made a recording, which the former later described as a &quot;treasure, a kind of talisman&quot;. They also made a private recording of Shostakovich&#x27;s 24 Preludes and Fugues in an arrangement for four-hands, but recording nor arrangement are both considered lost.

A 1955 ballet, &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, based on the eponymous children&#x27;s tale by Alexei Tolstoy that was itself adapted from Carlo Collodi&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, became Weinberg&#x27;s major work of the era. The work had originated from music Weinberg had composed for a &quot;vaudeville for children&quot; by the writer ; its success led to the commissioning of &quot;The Golden Key&quot;. The ballet was described by the musicologist Nataliya Gounko as a &quot;grandchild&quot; of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;.

As Weinberg&#x27;s reputation and income improved during the late 1950s, he indulged in his delight in shopping for clothes and second-hand books. His daughter Viktoria described him in these years as cutting the figure of a &quot;real Polish dandy&quot;.

===&quot;Stellar years&quot;===

Success and intense productivity marked Weinberg&#x27;s life in the 1960s. He received renewed support from the RSFSR Union of Composers, through the auspices of , as well as access to the union&#x27;s circuit of creative resorts across the Soviet Union. Weinberg composed a number of important works, including his Symphony No. 10 and String Quartet No. 12, at the resort in Dilijan, Armenian SSR. However, his favorite was in the town of Ruza, near Moscow. During visits there between 1953 and 1983, Weinberg composed four symphonies, three string quartets, six instrumental sonatas, the opera &quot;Congratulations!&quot;, and numerous other works. Increased royalties from performances of his concert music in combination with steady film work, which was the most profitable available to Soviet composers, provided Weinberg with the freedom to earn a comfortable living from composition alone.

The decade augured a streak of symphonic triumphs that began with the premiere of the Symphony No. 3 conducted by Alexander Gauk on March 23, 1960. With the Symphony No. 5 of 1962, Weinberg reached his maturity as a symphonic composer. According to the musicologist Lyudmila Nikitina, who had first met the composer in the early 1960s, the symphony crystallized procedures that Weinberg would continue to use throughout his life; wherein he drew from personal experience, treated the act of creation as a &quot;mirror of his individual perception&quot;, and produced music of social significance. The non-vocal symphonies that followed, Nos. 7 and 10, were by their chamber orchestra scoring comparatively restrained in its use of resources. The latter was enthusiastically praised by Shostakovich, while the former shows traces of being influenced by the sonorism that was characteristic of the emerging new Polish music.

Weinberg&#x27;s music was occasionally heard and his career reported on in his native Poland. A 1964 issue of the bi-monthly music magazine &quot;&quot; mentioned that he was a highly regarded composer in the Soviet Union whose name was often mentioned in connection with Shostakovich. In 1963, Weinberg&#x27;s String Quartet No. 8 was played by the Komitas Quartet at that year&#x27;s Warsaw Autumn. Audiences and critics considered the work old-fashioned and mostly ignored it. In 1966, an ultimately aborted attempt by Kondrashin to conduct Weinberg&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra on tour in Poland led to the composer&#x27;s first and only visit to the country of his birth since the war. Accompanied by his friend Tchaikovsky, Weinberg walked through the streets of Warsaw. Although he found his family home still standing, he was appalled as much by how the city had transformed as it had remained the same. Of its restored prewar buildings, Weinberg likened them to empty shells bereft of souls. &quot;His great disappointment&quot;, said the composer Krzysztof Meyer, who befriended Weinberg on this trip, &quot;was that the city he knew no longer existed&quot;. Despite much searching, he found virtually nobody who had known him before the war, aside from his former classmate Turski. He also finally learned about his family&#x27;s death. Weinberg&#x27;s feelings of unease on this trip were reinforced by the snubbing he received from most Polish composers; an outcome that was based on their perceptions of him as a stylistic reactionary and a member of the Soviet establishment, as well as their general suspicion of Russian culture. This did not preclude his enjoyment of their works such as Grażyna Bacewicz&#x27;s String Quartet No. 7 and Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;St. Luke Passion&quot;, which he heard at that year&#x27;s installment of the Warsaw Autumn. All the same, the visit left him disillusioned: he came to the conclusion that there was no country for him to return to.
Throughout the 1960s, Weinberg continued to compose music for films and cartoons. While the feature films he scored in those years did not attain a similar level of fame to those he scored in the 1950s, his music for the 1969 adaptation of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; directed by Fyodor Khitruk became an instant favorite with Soviet audiences; it has since been recognized as the best known of all his cartoon scores. Weinberg&#x27;s music continued to be renowned in Russia long after the cartoon&#x27;s release, with the verses sung by its titular character entering the popular lexicon. The composer said that off all his music for films and cartoons, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; contributed the most to the preservation of his legacy. One commentator described the cartoon&#x27;s patter songs as being so simple that they could have been created by a child; another held them up as a &quot;salient example of early Soviet rap&quot;.

From the vantage point of an interview in 1994, Weinberg looked back on the 1960s with fondness. He referred to the decade as his &quot;stellar years&quot;.

===Transitions, setbacks, and honors===
In the mid-1960s, Weinberg began an extramarital affair with Olga Rakhalskaya, daughter of the psychiatrist , that quickly developed into a romantic relationship. The couple had been introduced to each other to by Weinberg&#x27;s daughter Viktoria, who was Rakhalskaya&#x27;s classmate at Moscow State University. Weinberg divorced his wife Natalya in 1970 after dithering on the matter for a long period; she and their daughter emigrated to Israel in 1972. That same year, he married Rakhalskaya, who had given birth to their daughter Anna in 1971. Many of his peers and friends, who respected Natalya&#x27;s family and its legacy, shunned the composer after his divorce. Shostakovich was one of his few friends who remained supportive. There is no evidence that Weinberg&#x27;s career suffered as a direct result of his divorce and new marriage.

The rupture of Weinberg&#x27;s first marriage notwithstanding, his personal life stabilized in his later years, dominated mostly by work and increasingly illness. He continued to enjoy steady income from film work, which permitted him to continue composing full-time, although he complained that it occupied too much of his time. Olga described Weinberg as thinking nothing else but of musical work during these years:

He worked every single minute, day and night. If he wasn&#x27;t sleeping, he was working. Even in his sleep. When he was dozing off he would often drum his fingers without realizing it, as though they were grasping the piano keys. That&#x27;s why there are no memorable data in his biography: the only important landmarks in his life are what he composed.

Much of Weinberg&#x27;s time during these years was spent in his unsuccessful attempts to stage his opera &quot;The Passenger&quot;, based on the 1962 eponymous novel by Zofia Posmysz, which in turn she had adapted from her original radio play. The novel was translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union in 1963. One of its admirers was Shostakovich, who discerned the novel&#x27;s potential as a basis for an opera. He shared a copy with the writer Alexander Medvedev who, in turn, gave it to Weinberg. Its plot, about a former Auschwitz guard who believes she sees a long-dead inmate while traveling on an ocean liner, may have reminded Weinberg of a similar incident that had occurred to him while he met with Małcużyński, when the composer became agitated upon seeing one of the jailers from his 1953 arrest sitting nearby at a restaurant. Despite the enthusiastic approval of the board of the RSFSR Union of Composers, including Rodion Shchedrin, Shostakovich, Khrennikov, and Sviridov—who as union chairman praised the opera as being &quot;written with the heart&#x27;s blood&quot;—plans for a premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre were rejected by the Ministry of Culture. Later research has neither been able to determine a cause for this decision, nor other later rejections of proposed performances elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

Exponents of Weinberg&#x27;s music began to diminish or lose influence in the 1970s. His friend Sviridov&#x27;s term as chairman of the RSFSR Union of Composers ended in 1973; he was not reelected. A more serious loss was the death of Shostakovich on August 9, 1975. The two composers were in close contact almost to the very end; their mutual amity evident in that Weinberg&#x27;s name is the one that appeared the most in Shostakovich&#x27;s diary. In 1976, Weinberg composed his Symphony No. 12 in Shostakovich&#x27;s memory and asked Kondrashin to conduct its premiere. The conductor had previously balked at Weinberg&#x27;s vocal symphonies. When he was offered the Symphony No. 12, he accused the composer of having become &quot;arid, variable in quality, and expressionless&quot; since his Symphony No. 8. He stipulated furthermore that he would only conduct the Symphony No. 12 contingent on extensive cuts to the score to be approved by him. Exasperated by Kondrashin&#x27;s behavior, Weinberg terminated his friendship with him. Another friendship that ended was with Rostropovich, for whom the 24 Preludes for solo cello had been intended. By the time of its composition in 1968, his relationship with Weinberg worsened to the point that he never performed the work, despite having edited it for publication. Weinberg said near the end of his life that Rostropovich had become &quot;too busy&quot; to play his music. Rostropovich, on the other hand, said little other than calling Weinberg &quot;a coward&quot;. Other performers who regularly played Weinberg&#x27;s music, like Barshai, had emigrated. Still, he acquired a few new advocates, including Maxim Shostakovich and Vladimir Fedoseyev; the latter became a close friend and was entrusted with a series of premieres in the last decades of the composer&#x27;s life.

Concurrently, Weinberg received in 1971 the first of his official honors, Honored Artist of the RSFSR, and was written about widely in the musical press. He found contentment in life with his second wife and daughter, with whom he often spent time with in excursions to the town of outside of Moscow.

===Final years===
In 1980, Weinberg was awarded the People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR. His career, nevertheless, declined significantly in his last years. His friendship with Boris Tchaikovsky worsened, despite living in the same apartment building, and finally ruptured over what Olga described as &quot;pseudo-ideological reasons&quot;. Poor health prevented Weinberg from socializing and attending concerts; he became increasingly reclusive as a result. Changes in leadership at the Union of Composers also affected Weinberg professionally. He described his life and outlook during this period in a letter to Sviridov dated March 29, 1981:

As always, I work. I live quieter than a mouse, keeping a low profile. ... I now get sick often. People upset me more and more. I do not hope for anything and expect nothing.

In another letter to Sviridov dated January 5, 1988, Weinberg expressed his dismay at how quickly loneliness became entrenched into his life, especially after the activity he experienced in the 1960s. &quot;I do not lament it and accept it as a fact of life&quot;, he added.

His interest in new musical developments continued and he sought out personal acquaintance with some of the composers of the Soviet and Polish avant-garde, including Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, and Penderecki; he developed a cordial rapport with the latter two. In a 1988 interview, he named , Vladimir Dovgan, Elena Firsova, , Vasily Lobanov, Alexander Raskatov, , Tatyana Sergeyeva, and Dmitri Smirnov as his favorite young Soviet composers.

After being diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease in the late 1980s, Weinberg&#x27;s health sharply deteriorated. In 1990, he was awarded the USSR State Prize, his last Soviet honor. Despite discomfort from health problems, including a fever, Weinberg attended the ceremony at the Kremlin, which was broadcast on television. By the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, his creative energies diminished. The change from a communist to capitalist system had an immediate and adverse effect on Weinberg. Dependent on state support his whole life, he was immediately left without any sources of income after the new Russian Federation halted funding for the renamed Union of Russian Composers. Fedoseyev, Raskatov, and Shostakovich&#x27;s widow, Irina, were among those who thereafter provided Weinberg and his family with financial support.

Of more immediate concern was the loss of state healthcare. The Russian medical system had deteriorated to such a degree that he could not receive treatment after breaking his hip at his apartment in late 1992. Henceforth, he was homebound; in the last two years of his life he was bedridden. His wife Olga quit her job in order to devote herself to his care.

Belated recognition outside of Russia finally came at the very end of Weinberg&#x27;s life, facilitated by Tommy Persson, a Swedish judge who learned about the composer from reading Boris Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Music and Musical Life in Soviet Russia: 1917–1970&quot;. In the 1990s, Persson was the foremost promoter of the composer&#x27;s music outside of Russia. On December 8, 1994, Weinberg received at his apartment a delegation from the Polish Embassy in Russia, who awarded him the Meritorious Activist of Culture. , then a cultural attaché, recalled:

The composer was weak, bedridden, and evidently exhausted by illness, but calm. ... During my two-hour visit, he was clearly animated and interested in our conversation. He asked me about Polish composers, regretted that he could not return to Poland, and stressed his hope that his pieces could be performed in Poland. I officially informed him about awarding him the Polish medal and asked if I might decorate him. He agreed. It was an unconventional ceremony, but at the same time very emotional. When I was pinning the decoration on him, I saw that he did not hide the fact that he was very moved. ... &quot;I have to complain to you about the Creator&quot;, said [he]. &quot;As you can see, his idea of old age was not a success&quot;.

On March 8, 1995, Vadim Altskan, a representative of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, presented Weinberg with a recording that had been made there of his Piano Trio. Although he noted that Weinberg&#x27;s speech was impeded by severe breathing problems and that he looked &quot;very thin, very faint, like a shadow&quot;, Altskan said his face retained a youthful countenance.

====Conversion to Christianity====
In late November 1995, Weinberg discussed with his wife his interest in converting to Orthodox Christianity. His decision had been influenced from reading Joseph Brodsky&#x27;s poem &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot;, whose depiction of Simeon Stylites the composer found moving. Weinberg was baptized in February 1996. A letter from Weinberg to Sviridov contains annotations from the latter that suggest the two composers may have discussed matters pertaining to the Orthodox Church in person or over the telephone in late 1988. In the same letter, Weinberg wrote of his concern over the &quot;inevitability of losing one&#x27;s physical shell&quot; and of his music&#x27;s &quot;contact with spiritual, eternal values, without which a man is not a man&quot;.

Fanning believed that Weinberg converted under pressure from his wife, who was a Sunday school teacher of Jewish ancestry. Weinberg&#x27;s first daughter, Viktoria, said in a 2016 interview that because of Weinberg&#x27;s chronic illnesses, she doubted that his conversion had been voluntary. In her experience, Weinberg had &quot;never engaged in pursuit of God and was not religious at all&quot;. Olga denied that Weinberg had been coerced into conversion. She replied that involuntary baptism is sinful and of no value, and that Weinberg had been considering his conversion for about a year before he asked to be baptized. In his monograph on Weinberg, the British musicologist Daniel Elphick said that Weinberg&#x27;s conversion must be considered in context of the fact that there is no evidence that he ever practiced the Jewish faith:

Weinberg made extremely few statements about religion, but he evidently believed in God. His decision to convert was, according to [his daughter Anna], &quot;made entirely in his right mind&quot;. Although his first daughter has attempted to question this, all signs point to the conclusion that Weinberg made this very personal decision when faced with his imminent death.

Gwizdalanka said that although Weinberg may not have been aware that anti-Semitism in the Orthodox Church exceeded that in Western Christianity, the message of death as freedom and the promise of eternity in Brodsky&#x27;s poem had been decisive in his conversion. &quot;[Weinberg] was not just baptized, but he was a profoundly devout, Orthodox man&quot;, according to Fedoseyev. &quot;Nobody forced him to do anything, he did everything with conviction and knowingly&quot;.

===Death===
Weinberg died on February 26, 1996, in Moscow. Minutes before his death, Weinberg asked Olga to read to him from The Gospel. His last words were a request for &quot;some water&quot;, after which he sipped, then died. After a small funeral service presided by Alexander Medvedev, the librettist of &quot;The Passenger&quot;, and Valentin Berlinsky, Weinberg was buried on March 1, 1996 at .

==Personal character==
===Recollections===
Weinberg&#x27;s first wife, Natalya, mentioned him only twice in her memoirs. Viktoria, his first daughter, spoke at length about her father&#x27;s character in a 2016 interview with the pianist . She said that her father avoided discussions about his past. The trauma Weinberg experienced, his daughter said, left enduring traits and habits. He was paranoid of continued anti-Semitic persecution, extremely fearful of being unpunctual, and greatly worried that his connections with people outside of the Soviet Union would draw official scrutiny. When Weinberg&#x27;s former classmate, Małcużyński, requested to visit with him during a tour of the Soviet Union, the composer sought repeated reassurances from authorities that it was acceptable to meet with the pianist and invite him home. In general, Viktoria described Weinberg as being an unworldly person with a childish sense of helplessness at dealing with the world beyond music and that he constantly depended on the aid of family and friends. She also said that he was not an optimist by nature. &quot;Given all the tragic twists in his destiny&quot;, she continued, &quot;it was difficult for him to keep optimism and, maybe, even faith in God&quot;.

Olga, Weinberg&#x27;s second wife, dismissed Viktoria&#x27;s recollections, which she criticized as making the composer seem like a &quot;mental defective, who sometimes appeared to be more like a psychopath or schizophrenic&quot;:

[Her] image of an &quot;idiot savant&quot; who is irresponsible for his own actions because he understood nothing outside of music reflects little of Weinberg&#x27;s personality. A man who had financially supported his family since the age of 13, who beat out a living at the piano; a man who—while imprisoned was tortured by lack of sleep and the lights of nightsticks beamed into his eyes—never signed a single denunciation, must have known about personal responsibility. Closer to the essence of who he was are the words spoken about him in an article by his friend, the composer Lev Solin: &quot;A mighty spirit in a fragile body&quot;.

Fedoseyev remembered Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;remarkable kindness&quot; as a friend.

===Work ethic===
At home, family life was arranged entirely around Weinberg&#x27;s work schedule, which began early in the morning daily. When compositions were completed, he would play them for his family and friends, often late into the night. According to Viktoria, Weinberg preferred to spend his time at home, rather than socializing. Music was the common bond between him and his closest friends. In letters to Olga, Weinberg declared that the act of composition was something he did not approach lightly. &quot;[Composition] is an eternal conversation&quot;, he told her, &quot;an eternal search for harmony between mankind and nature&quot;. He went on to declare his disdain for the ostentatious personal affectations cultivated by other artists. A true artist, according to him, must radiate their intrinsic quality and distinctiveness in everyday fellowship with his audience.

&quot;He was quite strict as a professional&quot;, Fedoseyev recalled, but warm and humble to friends and colleagues:

Even on his deathbed, he managed to utter words that were crucial to me. In the very hushed voice of a dying man, he said: &quot;Thank you, Vladimir Ivanovich&quot;. That was how he expressed his thanks to me for the fact that I always conducted many of his works. He was very courteous, always even-tempered with colleagues, but, unfortunately, they did not respond in kind, somehow did not notice it. I would even say—they crushed him. It is difficult for me to judge the reasons for such coldness. Envy perhaps?

The neglect of his music in later years personally disappointed Weinberg, but he made no effort to promote his own music and often lost interest in his works after he completed them.

===Identification with Poland===
&quot;Poland is my homeland&quot;, Weinberg said after his visit to the country in 1966, &quot;but my second homeland remains Russia&quot;. Nevertheless, the Polish language became for him a symbol of what was lost in his birthplace; he maintained his command of it and regularly read in the language. Meyer observed that Weinberg&#x27;s Polish was perfect, formal, and bourgeois. Similarly, Mielcarek recalled Weinberg&#x27;s reaction when asked whether he preferred to speak Polish before he received his honor in 1994:

It was as if he was waiting for that opportunity, as if he needed it. His Polish was beautiful, flawless, and typical of the prewar Polish intelligentsia. He spoke fluently with an extraordinary richness of vocabulary.

Afterwards, Weinberg talked about his frustration at having the realization of his musical ideas impeded by the decay of his body. When Mielcarek asked him how he coped, the composer replied: &quot;Sir, fortunately there is still wonderful Polish music. Every day, I play Chopin&#x27;s pieces in my mind and I also listen to Moniuszko&#x27;s operas&quot;.

===Political beliefs===
Weinberg was a member of the CPSU. called him a &quot;great patriot of the Soviet Union and Russia&quot;. Weinberg admonished detractors, whom he said did not understand wartime terrors and how his adopted homeland had saved his life. Throughout his life, Weinberg rejected suggestions that the official persecution endured by him or other composers, including Shostakovich, had been severe, and denied facts relating to these. &quot;Evidently he had invested too much in his search for freedom to give up on it&quot;, wrote Fanning. Olga said in an essay published in 2023 that Weinberg&#x27;s patriotism for the Soviet Union and Russia should not be misunderstood as an &quot;imaginary love of Soviet officialdom&quot;.

==Music==
===Overview===
Weinberg&#x27;s work catalog consists of over 150 compositions designated with opus numbers, in addition to various incidental scores for feature films, cartoons, theatre, and the circus. His works include twenty-two symphonies, seventeen string quartets, nineteen instrumental sonatas, seven operas, four cantatas, four chamber symphonies, and more than one-hundred songs. Critical discourse about his music is mostly centered on his symphonies. Of all his works, the string quartets cover the widest span of his career, from 1937 to 1986. The composer used the genre to test ideas and stylistic motifs that he later developed in other compositions.

Weinberg&#x27;s compositions from his youth in Poland consisted of a pair of mazurkas, the Three Pieces for violin and piano, and his String Quartet No. 1; the latter was dedicated to Turczyński. It was not until after he became a pupil of Zolotarev that Weinberg began to seriously pursue composition as a vocation. While resident in Minsk, Weinberg composed several works. These included his Piano Sonata No. 2; &quot;Acacias&quot;, his first song cycle, with texts by Julian Tuwim; and his Symphonic Poem. Weinberg said that &quot;Acacias&quot; was meant to be a distraction from wartime stresses. He dedicated it to an unnamed woman with whom he may have been romantically interested. The Symphonic Poem had initially been named the &quot;Chromatic Symphony&quot;. It was premiered on June 21, 1941, by the State Symphony Orchestra of the Byelorussian SSR conducted by Ilya Musin.

In Tashkent, Weinberg developed his skills and composed prolifically. Aside from the Violin Sonata No. 1, he composed the Piano Sonata No. 2, which was premiered in Moscow by Emil Gilels, whom he had met in Tashkent. Two pieces for string quartet, the &quot;Aria&quot; and &quot;Capriccio&quot;, were also composed, but these remained unperformed during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. In addition, he also composed his &quot;Children&#x27;s Songs&quot; for voice and piano, based on texts by I. L. Peretz; they were the first of his compositions to be published.

Following Weinberg&#x27;s move to Moscow in 1943, he no longer dealt with privation and successfully integrated into the city&#x27;s musical culture. In the immediate postwar years, he added to his work catalog twenty-one compositions during these years—a total of approximately seven hours&#x27; worth of music. Many of them were quickly premiered after their completion. They were performed by Gilels, Maria Grinberg, , and the Beethoven Quartet. Some of the most notable works Weinberg composed in this period include his Piano Quintet, Piano Trio, Symphony No. 2, and his String Quartets Nos. 3 – 6.

During the period immediately following his release from jail, Weinberg established a career that accommodated his personal goals with those of the state. By the end of the 1950s he began to reorient his energies back into concert music; a turn signaled in 1957 by the composition of the String Quartet No. 7, his first essay in the genre in eleven years. As his prosperity and visibility increased in the 1960s, so did his connections with the top Soviet musicians of the era. Along with longstanding friends like Kogan, who premiered the Violin Concerto, a new generation of musicians—including Rudolf Barshai, Timofei Dokschitzer, Mikhail Fichtenholz, Kirill Kondrashin, and Mstislav Rostropovich—incorporated his music into their repertoire. The &quot;Allegretto&quot; from Weinberg&#x27;s String Quartet No. 7 became a favorite encore piece of the Borodin Quartet, while its successor, the String Quartet No. 8 from 1959, gained recognition in the West; for many years, it was the only one of the composer&#x27;s quartets played in the West. Works which had long remained unperformed, such as the Symphony No. 2, were premiered and played in the Soviet Union and elsewhere within the Eastern Bloc.

Weinberg continued to be prolifically creative through the 1980s. Among the works he composed during this period were five symphonies, four solo sonatas, three song cycles, two chamber symphonies, two operas, two string quartets, an operetta, and a concerto. His output dropped as a consequence of chronic health problems and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Weinberg completed a few works in the 1990s, including the sketch score of his Symphony No. 22, his last. Worsening health prevented him from orchestrating it and from continuing any further composition after 1994. Elphick said that Weinberg&#x27;s late music was both a product and reflection of the unraveling of Soviet society that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. His final works, according to the British musicologist, &quot;marked him out as something of a survivor, in terms of his main influences and his own musical language&quot;.

===Themes===
Childhood experiences and the trauma of World War II are recurring programmatic themes in Weinberg&#x27;s music. His outlook as a composer was defined by personal humanism and opposition to fascism. His later music was motivated by his need to memorialize the violence of war, death of his family, and loss of Poland as homeland. Seven of Weinberg&#x27;s compositions are dedicated to his family, of which four alone bear dedications to his mother; he commemorated the war in nine works, including the late symphonic trilogy, &quot;Having Crossed the Threshold of War&quot;. However, Weinberg adhered to the Soviet perception of World War II as a multinational tragedy to which no single group of peoples could claim having been exceptionally victimized. Therefore, his music neither explicitly commemorates the consequences that Jewish people experienced in the war nor the Holocaust in particular. His opera, &quot;The Passenger&quot;, while taking the Holocaust as its main subject, depicts prisoners from a wide range of nationalities and makes little specific mention of Jewish suffering.

===Influences===

Little is known about the influences and musical activities Weinberg experienced as a composer in Poland. While resident in Minsk, Weinberg first heard the music of Dmitri Shostakovich, an experience he later described as being like &quot;the discovery of a continent&quot;. This occurred during a performance by the State Symphony Orchestra of the Byelorussian SSR of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. Because the orchestra lacked a harp and celesta, Weinberg, who was the staff pianist, played both parts on the piano:

And so this was the first time I found out any music by [Shostakovich]... I understood that being just any composer was for more or less talented craftsmen, but a real composer was a reasoning and comprehending personality. I remember how, sitting and playing in the orchestra, I was amazed by every phrase, every musical idea, as if a thousand electrical charges were piercing me. Probably this is the feeling felt by everyone who at one time or another has felt the urge to exclaim &quot;Eureka!&quot;

Aside from the &quot;Three Fantastic Dances&quot;, Weinberg had little previous familiarity with Shostakovich&#x27;s music, a fact he expressed regret for later in life. &quot;Even today I feel aggrieved because I was deprived of his music in the strongest, freshest years of my youth&quot;, he said.

Fanning and Elphick wrote that Shostakovich, in turn, was also influenced by Weinberg, particularly in his early string quartets. When the composer Grigory Frid pointed out this mutual influence to Weinberg, the latter dismissed it. &quot;What are you, crazy?&quot;, Weinberg replied.

Sergei Prokofiev was another important influence on Weinberg&#x27;s music, as were Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Gustav Mahler, and Myaskovsky. Nikitina noted that Weinberg adopted from Mahler a desire to express through music a perception of reality that was profound and tragic. She said that the composer&#x27;s programmatic attitudes to composition and what she described as the pantheistic outlook of works such as the Sixth and Eighth symphonies best exemplified the connection between the two composers. Weinberg&#x27;s chamber music also evinces the influence of Alexander Borodin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. His music also contains elements of traditional Polish, Russian, and Jewish music. Deliberate choice and circumstances beyond Weinberg&#x27;s control led him to be influenced by the Polish and Soviet avant-garde in his late music.

According to Nikitina, the decisive event in Weinberg&#x27;s career was his move to the Soviet Union, where he matured as a composer. As a result, she said, his work was &quot;inextricably bound with Soviet artistic and quotidian life&quot; and is stylistically interlinked with the music of his compatriot contemporaries.

===Reception===
====In the Soviet Union and Russia====
Weinberg&#x27;s music was generally received positively in his early years in the Soviet Union, but it faced insinuations about its perceived derivativeness and dependence on wartime imagery. Postwar music critics, particularly Daniel Zhitomirsky, wrote about Weinberg&#x27;s music more favorably. His Piano Quintet was nominated for a Stalin Prize in 1945. The work was denied a prize because one of the jury members, the architect Arkady Mordvinov, objected to the work&#x27;s use of pizzicato, a common string technique that he was unfamiliar with. His rebuke of the work was also interpreted as a proxy attack against Shostakovich. In the event, Weinberg&#x27;s friend, Georgy Sviridov, ultimately won the first class prize in the chamber music category with his Piano Trio. In 1952, Shostakovich nominated Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes&quot; for a Stalin Prize, but it lost. Weinberg was one of the few major Soviet composers of the 1940s and early 1950s who neither won a Stalin Prize nor whose nominations ever progressed beyond the first round of voting.

The &quot;stellar years&quot; of the 1960s generated most of the Russian publications about Weinberg during his lifetime. The reception of his instrumental music proceeded largely without negative commentary. Mixed reactions and hostility from colleagues met his vocal music, however, such as his Symphony No. 6. A work that the musicologist Lyudmila Nikitina said is structured &quot;akin to a dramatic monologue&quot;, it is the first of his six vocal symphonies, and consists of settings of texts by Leib Kvitko, Samuil Galkin, and Mikhail Lukonin; all of whom were considered to be politically suspect by authorities. After its premiere on November 12, 1963, Dmitri Kabalevsky confided his intense dislike of the work to Karen Khachaturian and Rodion Shchedrin. The details of his criticism were relayed to Weinberg. Later, at a meeting of the Ministry of Culture, the musicologist attacked the symphony for being what he called a &quot;ballad of dead children&quot;. Their opposition resulted in the cancellation of an article about the symphony that had been scheduled for a forthcoming issue of &quot;Sovyetskaya Kultura&quot;. Weinberg was later personally confronted about the symphony by Kabalevsky, who related to him that he was &quot;immensely despondent and aghast at [its] extraordinary failure&quot;. When pressed about why the symphony was &quot;hopeless, sad, and even demoralizing&quot;, Weinberg responded that his symphony was nothing of the kind. &quot;The whole point of the symphony&quot;, he told Kabalevsky, &quot;was about the struggle against the most terrible evil of all—war—and that the Soviet people, who had suffered from fascism the most, would never permit war and, therefore, could sleep in peace&quot;.

In 1976, Weinberg composed his Symphony No. 12 in Shostakovich&#x27;s memory and asked Kondrashin to conduct its premiere. The conductor had previously balked at Weinberg&#x27;s vocal symphonies. When he was offered the Symphony No. 12, he accused the composer of having become &quot;arid, variable in quality, and expressionless&quot; since his Symphony No. 8. He stipulated that he would only conduct the new symphony contingent on extensive cuts to the score to be approved by him. Exasperated by Kondrashin&#x27;s behavior, Weinberg terminated his friendship with him. Another friendship that ended was with Rostropovich, for whom the 24 Preludes for solo cello had been intended. By the time of its composition in 1968, his relationship with Weinberg worsened to the point that he never performed the work, despite having edited it for publication. Weinberg said near the end of his life that Rostropovich had become &quot;too busy&quot; to play his music. Rostropovich, on the other hand, said little other than calling Weinberg &quot;a coward&quot;. Other performers who regularly played Weinberg&#x27;s music, like Barshai, had emigrated.

According to Alexander Tchaikovsky, Weinberg&#x27;s rapid marginalization from the mainstream of Soviet music in the 1980s was the by-product of increased interest in avant-gardists of the time such as Alfred Schnittke, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Edison Denisov that had occurred because of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;. &quot;Weinberg somehow [did] not exist for Soviet music&quot;, Tchaikovsky said. Many of Weinberg&#x27;s friends and colleagues had also died or left the Soviet Union. Because Weinberg never taught, he was unable to benefit from the help of a network of colleagues and students.

Weinberg&#x27;s 75th birthday in 1994 elicited no response from the Russian government and various musical organizations. The 80th anniversary of his birth in 1999, however, was commemorated with six concerts that programmed twenty-four of his chamber works; this was followed by a symposium. Interest in Weinberg&#x27;s music within Russia has increased in the 21st century, but not to the same degree as in the West.

<text>The Rif (, ), also called Rif Mountains, is a geographic region in northern Morocco. It is bordered on the north by the Mediterranean Sea and Spain and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and is the homeland of the Rifians and the Jebala people. This mountainous and fertile area is bordered by Cape Spartel and Tangier to the west, by Berkane and the Moulouya River to the east, by the Mediterranean to the north, and by the Ouergha River to the south. The Rif mountains are separated into the eastern Rif mountains (Nador, Driouch, Al Hoceima) and western Rif mountains (Tangier, Tetouan, Chefchaouen, Taounate).

==Geography==
Geologically, the Rif Mountains belong to the Gibraltar Arc or Alborán Sea geological region. They are an extension of the Baetic System, which includes the mountains of the southern Iberian Peninsula across the strait. Thus, the Rif Mountains are not part of the Atlas Mountain System.

Major cities in the greater Rif region include Nador, Al Hoceima (also called Villa), Imzouren, Driouch, Ben Taieb, Midar and Al Aaroui and a few (small) towns: Segangan, Selwan, Ajdir and Targuist (Targist).

== History ==
The Rif has been inhabited by Berbers since prehistoric times. As early as the 11th century BC, the Phoenicians began to establish trading posts with the approval of or partnership with the local Berbers; had started interbreeding and creating a Punic language on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts; and had founded cities such as Tetouan, Rusadir (now Melilla) and (in the 5th century BC) Tingi (now Tangier). 

After the Third Punic War, the coast of North Africa came under the control of Rome, and the Rif became part of the Kingdom of Mauretania. When Mauretania was divided during the rule of Emperor Claudius, Tangier became the capital of Mauretania Tingitana. In the 5th century AD, the Roman rule came to an end, and the region was later reconquered and partly controlled by the Byzantine Empire.

In 710, Salih I ibn Mansur founded the Emirate of Nekor in the Rif, and Berbers started converting to Islam. By the 15th century, many Moors were exiled from Spain, and most of them settled in Western Rif and brought their culture, such as Andalusian music, and even established the city of Chefchaouen. Since then, the Rif has suffered numerous battles with Spain and Portugal. In 1415, Portugal invaded Ceuta, and in 1490 Spain conquered Melilla.

The Hispano-Moroccan War broke out in 1859 in Tetouan, and Morocco was defeated. The Spanish-Moroccan conflicts continued in the 20th century, under the leadership of Abd el-Krim, the Berber guerrilla leader who proclaimed the Republic of the Rif in 1921. The Riffian Berbers won several victories over the Spanish in the Rif War in the 1920s before they were eventually defeated; the war saw extensive use of chemical weapons by Spanish forces. The Spanish region was decolonised and restored to Morocco by Spain in April 1956, a month after the French region gained its independence from France. Shortly afterward, a revolt broke out in the north against the Moroccan king by Riffian insurgents in 1958, but it was easily suppressed.

==Economy==

Farmers in the Rif produce most of Morocco&#x27;s supply of cannabis. The region is economically underdeveloped.

== Environment ==

According to C. Michael Hogan, there are between five and eight separate subpopulations of the endangered primate Barbary macaque, &quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot;. The Rif mountains are also home to the honey bee subspecies &quot;Apis mellifera major&quot;.

The Rif region receives more rainfall than any other region in Morocco, with some portions receiving upwards of of precipitation a year. The western and central portions are more rainy and are covered in forests of Atlas cedar, cork oak and holm oak, as well as the only remaining forests of Moroccan fir, a subspecies of the Spanish fir. The eastern slopes receive less rainfall, and there forests consist mainly of pines, particularly the Aleppo pine and the maritime pine, as well as tetraclinis.

Massive deforestation due to overgrazing, forest fires, and forest clearing for agriculture, particularly for the creation of cannabis plantations, has taken place since the 1950s. This deforestation has led to soil degradation due to the washing away of topsoil, which has aggravated the process.

==Tribes==
The Rif is home to tribal people belonging to different tribes which are usually subdivided in even smaller groups. Following is a list of tribes:
*Gzenaya
*Ait Waryaghar
*Ait Amart
*Ait Touzine
*Ait Temsaman 
*Ait Ulishk
*Ait Tafersit 
*Ait Said
*Kebdana
*Targuist
*Bokoya
*Ait Itteft
*Ait Boufrah
*Ait Hadifa

<text>The Division of Dunkley is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division is located south-east of Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula. It covers an area of approximately from in the north to in the south and Langwarrin South in the southeast. Following the 2024 Dunkley by-election, Jodie Belyea currently represents the seat.

== List of Localities in Dunkley ==

* Frankston (seat)
* Frankston South
* Frankston North
* Mount Eliza
* Karingal
* Langwarrin
* Langwarrin South
* Skye
* Carrum Downs
* Sandhurst
* Seaford

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

As a result of a periodical boundary redistribution, from the 2025 Australian federal election, Dunkley’s boundaries will move north to include the suburbs of Carrum, Bonbeach, Patterson Lakes, Chelsea (part) and Chelsea Heights (part), while losing the southern part of Mount Eliza to neighbouring Flinders.

==History==
The division was created in 1984 and is named for Louisa Margaret Dunkley, a trade unionist and campaigner for equal pay for women.

It was held by the Liberal Party from 1996 to 2019, however a 2018 boundary redistribution that favoured Labor, along with Labor&#x27;s increased statewide strength in Victoria resulted in Peta Murphy winning the seat for the Labor Party at the 2019 Australian federal election.

<text>Biastophilia (from Greek &quot;biastes&quot;, &quot;rapist&quot; + &quot;-philia&quot;) and its Latin-derived synonym raptophilia (from Latin &quot;rapere&quot;, &quot;to seize&quot;), also paraphilic rape, is a paraphilia in which sexual arousal is dependent on, or is responsive to, the act of assaulting an unconsenting person, especially a stranger. Some dictionaries consider the terms synonymous, while others distinguish raptophilia as the paraphilia in which sexual arousal is responsive to actually raping the victim.

The source of the arousal in these paraphilias is the victim&#x27;s terrified resistance to the assault, and in this respect it is considered to be a form of sexual sadism.

Under the name paraphilic coercive disorder, this diagnosis was proposed for inclusion in DSM-5. This diagnosis, under the name paraphilic rapism, was proposed and rejected in the DSM-III-R. It has been criticized because of the impossibility of reliably distinguishing between paraphilic rapists and non-paraphilic rapists, and because of this diagnosis, under the term &quot;Paraphilia NOS&quot; (not otherwise specified), non-consent had been used in Sexually Violent Person/Predator commitment.

A standard concept in Czechoslovakian sexology is pathologic sexual aggressivity instead. This term is strongly distinguished from sadism. This disorder is understood as a coordination anomaly of the sexual motivation system (SMS), a &quot;courtship disorder&quot; according to Kurt Freund or displacement paraphilia by John Money, or a missing segment of SMS.

<text>The rete testis ( ; : retia testes) is an anastomosing network of delicate tubules located in the hilum of the testicle (mediastinum testis) that carries sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the efferent ducts. It is the homologue of the rete ovarii in females. Its function is to provide a site for fluid reabsorption.

==Structure==

The rete testis is the network of interconnecting tubules where the straight seminiferous tubules (the terminal part of the seminiferous tubules) empty. It is located within a highly vascular connective tissue in the mediastinum testis. The epithelial cells form a single layer that lines the inner surface of the tubules. These cells are cuboidal, with microvilli and a single cilium on their surface.

===Development===
In the development of the urinary and reproductive organs, the testis is developed in much the same way as the ovary, originating from mesothelium as well as mesonephros. Like the ovary, in its earliest stages it consists of a central mass covered by a surface epithelium. In the central mass, a series of cords appear. These cords run together toward the future hilum and form a network that ultimately becomes the rete testis.

==Function==
It appears the function of the rete testis is to mix the sperm as they leave the seminiferous tubules. Sperm leave the seminiferous tubules in the dilute secretions of Sertoli cells. The rete testis does modify the luminal fluids with a limited amount of secretion and reabsorption, but their primary function is to mix and transport the sperm into the efferent ductules, where the major function is reabsorption of about 95% of the fluid, which increases the sperm concentration prior to entering the epididymis.

==Clinical significance==
Rete tubular ectasia is a disorder of the rete testis characterized by multiple benign cysts.

==Etymology==
English uses the Neo-Latin name for the structure, which simply means &quot; of the &quot;.

<text>Keith Douglas Suter (born 1948) is an Australian consultant on strategic planning and a futurist.

Suter has achieved three doctorates. The first of these was about the international law of guerrilla warfare (University of Sydney), and the second about the social and economic consequences of the arms race (Deakin University) and a third doctorate on scenario planning (Sydney University). He was awarded the Australian Government&#x27;s Peace Medal in 1986: The International Year of Peace and was Rostrum&#x27;s &quot;Communicator of the Year&quot; in 1995.

In the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Suter was appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;significant service to international relations, and to the Uniting Church in Australia&quot;.

The Club of Rome members share a common concern for the future of humanity and the planet.” The club has only 100 members, with Mikhail Gorbachev amongst them. As of 2023, Suter is the President of the Australian Chapter of the Club of Rome.

Suter is a life member of the United Nations Association of Australia in recognition of his service. At various times from 1978 to 1999, he served as the national president of the organisation and took on the roles of the Western Australia and New South Wales state president.

In addition, he served as a consultant for a number of other organisations, with a focus on local and international issues.

<text>The Ghomara (, &quot;Ighmaren&quot;) are a group of tribes in northern Morocco belonging to the Berbers. They live in the western Rif, in the area of Chefchaouen and Tetouan.

Originally, Ghomaras were a Berber tribal group belonging to the Masmuda confederacy. While most have shifted to speaking Arabic, a minority continue to speak the Berber Ghomara language.

== Tribes ==
The Ghomaras are traditionally divided into nine tribes:

*Beni Bouzra

<text>Hammarby IF Fotbollförening, commonly known as Hammarby IF, Hammarby Fotboll or simply Hammarby ( ), is a women&#x27;s football club from Stockholm founded in 1970.

Hammarby play their home games at Hammarby IP (also called Kanalplan) in the Södermalm district of Stockholm, and occasionally at Zinkensdamms IP and Tele2 Arena.

Competing in Sweden&#x27;s first tier, Damallsvenskan, Hammarby are placed fourth in the all-time Damallsvenskan table, and has won the Swedish championship twice: in 1985 and 2023. The club has won Svenska Cupen, the domestic cup competition, three times: in 1994, 1995 and 2023.

Since 2016, the club has been affiliated with Hammarby Fotboll, a men&#x27;s team in Allsvenskan, and is a member of the Stockholms Fotbollförbund through its parent club.

==History==
===1970–1984: Establishment of football club===

The team was established in 1970, as a section under multi-sports club Hammarby IF, making it one the pioneers in Swedish women&#x27;s football. Christer Molander is credited as being the founding force behind the establishment of a women&#x27;s team within the club, and he also worked as head coach for the first five years. In 1973, he also coached the Swedish national team in their first ever official international game, a 0–0 home draw against Finland. Four players from Hammarby took part in the historical fixture: Gun Hellestig, Ingalill Arvling, Birgitta Johansson and Ann Jansson. About a year later, on 26 July 1974, Jansson would score Sweden&#x27;s first ever international goal in a 0–1 away win against the same opponent, Finland.

From her debut in 1972 until in her retirement in 1984, Jansson was Hammarby&#x27;s undisputed star player. In total, she scored 864 goals in 642 appearances as a forward, a club record. She led her side to five Swedish championship finals, but Hammarby lost all of them: to Jitex BK in 1974, Jakobsbergs GoIF in 1977, Sunnanå SK in 1982, and Öxabäcks IF in both 1978 and 1983. An other driving force behind Hammarby&#x27;s success was Gunilla Paijkull. After five seasons as a player, she took over as head coach in 1977, a role she held for four years.

===1985–1999: First championship title===
In 1985, Hammarby won their first Swedish championship title, beating GAIS in the final by 7–2 on aggregate. Hammarby forward Anette Nilsson became the league&#x27;s top scorer with 19 goals.

One of the most renowned Swedish players, Pia Sundhage joined the club in 1986, but left after one season only to return in 1990. In 1994, she took over as player-coach and immediately led Hammarby to silverware. Although the club finished as runner-up in Damallsvenskan, they won Svenska Cupen through a 2–1 win against Gideonsbergs IF in the final. In 1995, Hammarby defended its cup title through a 1–0 final win against Älvsjö AIK. Previously, the team had been the cup&#x27;s runner-up in its first three editions (1981–83).

In 1999, Hammarby IF was reorganized when all the underlying sections got separated into an umbrella organization, with Hammarby IF DFF being founded.

===2000–2022: Yo-yo club and attendance record===
The team declined from 2005 and in 2011 it was relegated to First Division for the first time. Before its relegation it was one of only two teams (the other one being FC Rosengård) to have played all 24 editions of the Damallsvenskan to date since the competition&#x27;s foundation in 1988.

In modern years, Hammarby has been a typical yo-yo club. They finished the 2014 Elitettan season in 2nd place &amp; gained promotion back to the Damallsvenskan. However, they enjoyed a short stint in the top tier getting relegated in 2015. In 2016, the club once again gained a promotion from the second tier.

Before the start of the 2017 season, the side merged with Hammarby IF Fotboll, which previously only included the men&#x27;s division.

On 10 October 2021, Hammarby set a new record attendance of 18,537 in Damallsvenskan, in a 4–1 home win against fierce rivals AIK played at Tele2 Arena.

===2023–: Winning the domestic double===
On 6 June 2023, Hammarby won the 2022–23 Svenska Cupen, claiming their third title in the tournament&#x27;s history. The final ended in a 3–0 win at home against BK Häcken, played in front of an attendance of 17,623. The club also won the 2023 Damallsvenskan, becoming Swedish champions for the second time in its history. In the last round of the campaign on 11 November, Hammarby won 2–0 against IFK Norrköping, bringing over 7,000 away fans to the away game. Later the same day, thousands of fans gathered at Medborgarplatsen in Stockholm to celebrate the title.

<doc id="1122026" wikidata="Q2560493" url="?curid=1122026" title="Gunnar Fant">
<text>Carl Gunnar Michael Fant (October 8, 1919 – June 6, 2009) was a leading researcher in speech science in general and speech synthesis in particular who spent most of his career as a professor at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. He was a first cousin of the actors and directors George Fant and Kenne Fant.

Gunnar Fant received a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from KTH in 1945. He specialized in the acoustics of the human voice, measuring formant values, and continued to work in this area at Ericsson and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also took the initiative of creating a speech communication department at KTH, unusual at the time.

Fant&#x27;s work led to the birth of a new era of speech synthesis with the introduction of powerful and configurable formant synthesizers. In 1960 he published the source-filter model of speech production, which became widely used. In the 1960s, Gunnar Fant&#x27;s Orator Verbis Electris (OVE) competed with Walter Lawrence&#x27;s Parametric Artificial Talker (PAT) in creating lifelike speech synthesis.

In later years, Gunnar Fant remained active in the area of speech synthesis, focusing mainly on research on prosody.

<text>Midnight Run is a 1988 American action comedy film directed by Martin Brest, written by George Gallo, and starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin. Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, Joe Pantoliano, and Philip Baker Hall play supporting roles.

At the 46th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor for De Niro. A critical and commercial success, the film was followed by &quot;The Midnight Run Action Pack&quot; in 1994, three made for television sequels which did not feature any of the principal actors, although a few characters are carried over from the first film.

==Plot==
Bounty hunter Jack Walsh is enlisted by bail bondsman Eddie Moscone to find accountant Jonathan Mardukas and bring him to Los Angeles. Mardukas had embezzled $15 million from Chicago mob boss Jimmy Serrano before skipping on the $450,000 bail Moscone had posted for him. Moscone demands Walsh bring Mardukas back within 5 days. Walsh asks for a $100,000 fee, despite Moscone&#x27;s assurance that the job is easy, a &quot;midnight run&quot;. Walsh is then approached by FBI Special Agent Alonzo Mosely, who needs Mardukas to be a witness against Serrano. Mosely orders Walsh to stay away from Mardukas.

Walsh ignores Mosely&#x27;s order and steals Mosely&#x27;s ID, which he uses to pass himself off as an FBI agent along his journey. Serrano&#x27;s henchmen offer Walsh $1 million to turn Mardukas over to them, but Walsh declines. Walsh captures Mardukas in New York City and calls Moscone from the airport, unaware that Moscone&#x27;s line is being tapped by the FBI and that his assistant, Jerry, is secretly tipping off Serrano&#x27;s men. Mardukas tells Walsh that he has a fear of flying; Walsh does not believe Mardukas until they get on the plane and Mardukas fakes a panic attack, forcing them to travel by train. When they fail to show up in Los Angeles on time, Moscone sends bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler, a rival of Walsh, to find them.

Dorfler finds the pair in Pittsburgh and attempts to take Mardukas from Walsh, but Walsh gets the drop on him and leaves the train with Mardukas. Walsh then attempts to purchase bus tickets with his credit card, only to discover that Dorfler has canceled it. Without funds, Walsh is forced to rely on other means to get across the country, including stealing cars, taking a bus in Fremont, Ohio, and hitchhiking from Amarillo, Texas.

Meanwhile, Mosely leads a task force to find Walsh and Mardukas after hearing of the skirmish on the train. While alone with Mardukas, Walsh reveals that ten years ago, he worked as an undercover officer in Chicago, trying to get close to a drug dealer who had almost the entire department on his payroll. Just as Walsh was going to bust the dealer, corrupt cops planted heroin in his house. To avoid both going to prison and working for the dealer, Walsh resigned and became a bounty hunter. His wife divorced him and married a corrupt lieutenant; however, Walsh still clings to the faint hope that his ex-wife will reunite with him.

Later, Mardukas learns that the drug dealer was Serrano. In Sedona, Arizona, Dorfler takes Mardukas away from Walsh, who is subsequently found by Mosely. While arguing with Moscone over the phone, Walsh realizes that Dorfler intends to turn Mardukas over to Serrano. However, Dorfler inadvertently reveals to Serrano&#x27;s men where Mardukas is; they knock him unconscious and go after Mardukas themselves.

Walsh bluffs Serrano&#x27;s men that he has computer disks created by Mardukas with enough information to put Serrano away, but promises to hand them over if Serrano hands Mardukas over unharmed. He then makes a deal with Mosely to deliver Serrano to the FBI in exchange for being allowed to take Mardukas back to Los Angeles. Walsh meets up with Serrano while wearing a wire and being watched by the FBI. Dorfler spots Mardukas and interrupts the exchange, unknowingly disabling the wire. After Serrano takes the disks, the FBI agents close in and arrest Serrano and his henchmen. Mosely turns Mardukas over to Walsh.

When Walsh and Mardukas arrive in Los Angeles, Walsh realizes that he cannot bring himself to send Mardukas to prison (where he will certainly be killed by Serrano&#x27;s incarcerated associates), and lets him go. Before parting, Walsh gives Mardukas a watch that his wife had given him before their marriage, symbolizing he has finally let her go. In return, Mardukas gives Walsh $300,000 in a money belt he had been hiding, and clarifies, &quot;It&#x27;s not a payoff. It&#x27;s a gift. You already let me go.&quot; Mardukas says goodbye and abruptly leaves. Walsh flags down a taxi and asks the driver if he has change for a $1,000 bill, but the driver thinks Walsh is joking and drives away. Walsh begins walking home.

==Cast==
==Production==
After completing &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, De Niro wanted to try something different and decided on appearing in a comedy. He pursued the lead role in Penny Marshall&#x27;s film, &quot;Big&quot;. Marshall was interested, but the studio was not, so the role went to Tom Hanks. Martin Brest, who directed &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, had developed a script with George Gallo that blended elements of comedy and action.

Gallo says he based the relationship between Jack and the Duke on his own parents. &quot;I don&#x27;t think they ever realized how funny they were when they were arguing about something,&quot; he said. &quot;My father was very emotional whereas my mother was far more calculating. She would let him talk and lead him down alleys and then strike like a cat.&quot;

Gallo paid tribute to Martin Brest, saying &quot;Marty was highly focused, where I was a bit more all over the place. I&#x27;m not a person who suffers from not having ideas. If anything, I have too many ideas. Marty helped rein me in to stay focused on the main story. This has helped me a great deal since my collaboration with him.&quot;

Paramount Pictures was originally interested in backing &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, but they wanted a big name star opposite De Niro in order to improve the film&#x27;s chances at the box office. Their production executives suggested that the Mardukas character be changed to a woman and wanted Cher for the role in the hope she would provide some &quot;sexual overtones.&quot; When Brest rejected the idea, Paramount suggested teaming De Niro up with Robin Williams, who became eager to get the role and offered to audition for Brest. At one stage Bruce Willis was mentioned as a possible co star.

Brest was impressed by Grodin&#x27;s audition with De Niro, however, feeling that there was a real chemistry between the two actors. As a result, Paramount backed out and their UIP partner Universal Pictures became interested in the project. Paramount president Ned Tanen claimed that the budget became too high and he decided that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&quot; Universal executive Casey Silver had worked with Brest on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and he was integral in setting up the project at Universal.

To research for his role, De Niro worked with real-life bounty hunters and police officers. As Walsh uncuffs Mardukas on the train, the latter says, &quot;Thanks, &#x27;cause they&#x27;re starting to cut into my wrists.&#x27;&quot; In fact, Grodin had permanent scars resulting from the handcuffs he had to wear for most of the film. The scene where Mardukas falls off a cliff was shot on location in the Salt River Canyon in White Mountain, Arizona, and the conclusion, taking place in rapids, was shot in New Zealand because the water was too cold in Arizona.

&quot;I trusted Marty would choose the material that was most suited for the scene,&quot; said De Niro. &quot;He&#x27;s aware of everything in Chuck&#x27;s style, in my style. He had to balance all that, and I think he did it very well.&quot;

Yaphet Kotto remembered the film being a difficult shoot.
De Niro is very spontaneous and it always helps to work with an artist like that. But Marty Brest! &quot;Herr Director&quot; shot so many takes of the scenes that I lost all joy in doing the film. It became hard and tedious work. Then he stopped eating during the shoot and became thinner and thinner each day, until he looked like a ghost behind the camera. When I met Marty at the Universal studio with De Niro, he looked healthy and strong, but as filming went on, he began to turn into someone you&#x27;d see in Dachau. It was weird. I got sick and for the whole of the film I had a fever and was under the weather for most of it ... I was shocked when it came off so funny ... It sure wasn&#x27;t funny making it.
Universal invested $15 million in a print and television advertising campaign.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Midnight Run&quot; was released on July 20, 1988, in 1,158 theaters, grossing US$5.5 million in its opening weekend. It went on to make $38.4 million in North America and $43.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $81.6 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Enlivened by the antagonistic chemistry between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, &quot;Midnight Run&quot; is an uncommonly entertaining odd couple comedy.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote, &quot;What &quot;Midnight Run&quot; does with these two characters is astonishing, because it&#x27;s accomplished within the structure of a comic thriller ... It&#x27;s rare for a thriller to end with a scene of genuinely moving intimacy, but this one does, and it earns it.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott praised the performances: &quot;De Niro has the time of his acting life lightening up and sending up all those raging bulls that won him all those Oscars ... Charles Grodin, master of the double-take and maestro of the slow burn, the best light character comic since Jack Benny stopped playing himself&quot;. Vincent Canby, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;Mr. De Niro and Mr. Grodin are lunatic delights, which is somewhat more than can be said for the movie, whose mechanics keep getting in the way of the performances&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson says of the director that, &quot;carrying the dead weight of George Gallo&#x27;s script, Brest isn&#x27;t up to the strenuous task of transforming his uninspired genre material in something deeper, and so the attempts to mix pathos with comedy strike us merely as wild and disorienting vacillations in tone&quot;. David Ansen, in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, wrote, &quot;The outline of George Gallo&#x27;s script — odd couple antagonists become buddies under perilous circumstances — was stale five years ago, and the outcome offers no surprises. Too bad: a lot of good work has been wasted on an unworthy cause&quot;.

==Legacy==
Thirty years on, critics have warmed to the movie. For the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Alan Sepinwall, who has repeatedly professed that &quot;Midnight Run&quot; is his favorite movie, wrote about it for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:
Yet all that ultimately matters---and makes the movie a classic worth revisiting on the 30th anniversary of its release---are two other words: Walsh and Duke.
George Gallo put the success of the movie down to the relationship between Jack and the Duke.
In many ways it is a love story, although it is one that is short-lived. They meet each other, take an instant dislike to one another and over time grow to respect each other which leads to deeper feelings. Both men realize, despite their differences, that they share core beliefs of what is right and wrong. Audiences also think that the road trip angle to the story rings true. Everyone who has ever gone on a long road trip knows that things can go wrong and, as a result, adults can be reduced to behaving like children. No matter how well a script is written, it has to be fully realized by the director and actors. Every last person working on the film did a terrific job.
De Niro attributed a lot of the film&#x27;s eventual success to Charles Grodin. &quot;The way Chuck Grodin is, it worked,&quot; he said. &quot;His character was irritating and Chuck knew how to do that, to work that. I felt like that was a good way to go.&quot;

==Sequels==

=== Film ===

On November 8, 2021, it was announced that Universal Pictures was developing a sequel to star Regina Hall with De Niro attached as a producer.

<text>The Division of Flinders is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. The division is one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election. It is named after Matthew Flinders, the first man to circumnavigate Australia, and the person credited with giving Australia its name.

Originally a country seat south and east of Melbourne, Flinders is now based on the outer southern suburbs on the Mornington Peninsula, including Dromana, Hastings and Portsea. Even though Melbourne&#x27;s suburban growth has long since spilled onto the peninsula, Flinders is still counted as a rural seat.

As of 2022, Flinders is the Liberal Party&#x27;s only safe seat in Melbourne.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at re-distributions by a re-distribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Re-distributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

It has usually been a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party and its predecessors, who have held it for all but six years since its creation. However, it has occasionally been won by the Australian Labor Party, notably at the 1929 federal election when Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was defeated. This was the first of two times an incumbent Australian prime minister lost his own seat at a general election; the second time was not until Liberal Prime Minister John Howard lost his seat of Bennelong at the 2007 federal election.

The seat&#x27;s most prominent member was Bruce, who held it for all but two years from 1918 to 1933. Other prominent former members include Jack Holloway, the Labor challenger who ousted Bruce and later a senior minister in the Curtin and Chifley governments (though he was the member for Melbourne Ports by then) and two deputy Liberal leaders – Sir Phillip Lynch (a minister in the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments) and Peter Reith (a minister in the Howard government).

<text>The 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, formally titled the Prix de Monte-Carlo et XI Grand Prix Automobile, was a Formula One motor race held on 21 May 1950 at Monaco. It was race two of seven in the 1950 World Championship of Drivers. The 100-lap race was held at an overall distance of 318.1 km (197.1 mi) and was won by Juan Manuel Fangio for the Alfa Romeo team after starting from pole position. Alberto Ascari finished second for Ferrari and Louis Chiron finished third for Maserati. It was also the first race for Ferrari in Formula One.

==Report==

After two qualifying sessions, on Thursday and Saturday, which Charles Pozzi, Yves Giraud-Cabantous, Pierre Levegh and Clemente Biondetti did not start, the race was dominated from start to finish by Juan Manuel Fangio, who scored his first ever victory in a World Championship event, driving an Alfa Romeo. The starting grid consisted of alternating rows of three and two, starting with three on the front row and continuing up to two on the 8th row. The first two rows of the grid (positions 1 to 5) were made up of the fastest five drivers from the Thursday qualifying session, with the remaining positions based on the other 16 drivers&#x27; times in the second session on the Saturday. This format meant that Luigi Villoresi started 6th, despite his time being fast enough for 2nd place on the grid.

Due to an accident in practice, Alfredo Piàn did not start the race, with Peter Whitehead another non-starter. The race was marred by a large pile-up during the first lap, when a wave from the harbour flooded the track at Tabac Corner. Nino Farina in 2nd, spun and crashed while Fangio managed to escape the chaos. Those who were behind them tried to stop or avoid the carnage, but eight more drivers (from a field of 19 drivers) crashed and retired. None of them was injured, but José Froilán González, who damaged his Maserati in the pile-up but was subsequently running second, crashed during the second lap. His car caught fire and he suffered burns. The race went on with many cars going off at Tabac Corner, nearly causing other accidents. Ferrari driver Luigi Villoresi charged his way from the back of the field after being delayed by the pile-up, but did not finish.

Harry Schell&#x27;s Cooper was the first rear-engined car to start in a championship race. Chiron&#x27;s 3rd-place finish made him the only Monegasque driver to score points in Formula One until Charles Leclerc finished 6th in the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix some 68 years later.

<text>The 34th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Tuesday, May 30, 1950. The event was sanctioned by the AAA and served as the premier event on the calendar of the 1950 AAA National Championship Trail. For the first time, the race was included as a points-paying event towards the FIA-sanctioned World Drivers&#x27; Championship. The race was originally scheduled for 200 laps (500 miles), but was stopped after 138 laps (345 miles) due to rain.

A rumor circulated in racing circles during and after this race that Johnnie Parsons&#x27;s team discovered an irreparable crack in the engine block on race morning. The discovery supposedly precipitated Parsons to charge for the lap leader prizes. Presumably, he set his sights on leading as many laps as possible before the engine inevitably was to fail. Furthermore, the race ending early due to rain supposedly saved Parsons&#x27;s day allowing him to secure the victory before the engine let go. However, the engine block crack was proved to be an urban myth, and it was said to be a very minor but acceptable level of porosity, which did not significantly affect the performance.

Parsons&#x27;s win saw him score 9 points and move to a temporary first-place tie (after 3 races on the Formula One season calendar) in the first ever World Drivers&#x27; Championship, alongside Nino Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio, and also saw him become the first American to win a World Championship race. Parsons is one of only three drivers to have won his first World Championship race, the other two being Farina, who won the first World Championship race (the 1950 British Grand Prix, 17 days earlier) and Giancarlo Baghetti, who won the 1961 French Grand Prix. Despite the 500 being his only race in the World Championship, it would be enough to see him finish the championship 6th in points.

During the month, Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck were at the track to film scenes for the film &quot;To Please a Lady&quot;. Stanwyck was on hand in victory lane after the race for the traditional celebratory kiss to the winner. During 1951 a young Mario Andretti saw the film in his native Italy - where it was titled &quot;Indianapolis&quot; - an event which exposed the future Indianapolis 500 winner and four-time National Champion to the race for the first time.

==Time trials==

Time trials was scheduled for six days.

*Saturday May 13: Walt Faulkner won the pole position with a record run of 134.343 mph.
*Sunday May 14
*Saturday May 20: The third day of time trials saw six cars complete runs. Bayliss Levrett (131.181 mph) was the fastest of the afternoon. Charles Van Acker was ruled physically disqualified, after a crash he suffered at the Speedway from 1949.
*Sunday May 21
*Saturday May 27: The day began with 11 spots open in the grid.
*Sunday May 28: Only one driver managed to bump his way into the field. Johnny McDowell bumped Cliff Griffith, while 15 other cars failed to make the field. The two Novi entries failed to qualify – Chet Miller had engine trouble in one of the cars, while the other snapped a supercharger shaft. Rain and two crashes cut the track time to less than three hours. Cy Marshall was among the few left in line when time trials closed at 6 p.m.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===

The 1950 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 7 on the 1950 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract significant interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Giuseppe Farina and Franco Rol submitted Maserati entries, but their cars never arrived, and the race took place without any European competitors. Race winner Johnnie Parsons earned 9 points towards the World Championship (8 points for first place, and 1 point for the fastest lap). Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished sixth in the final season standings.

Parsons is one of only three drivers to win on their WDC début. The other two are Farina, who won the inaugural World Championship race – the 1950 British Grand Prix, 17 days earlier – and Giancarlo Baghetti, who won the 1961 French Grand Prix.

*Note: Only the top five positions are listed. Only the best four results counted towards the Championship.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the Mutual Broadcasting System, the precursor to the IMS Radio Network. The broadcast was sponsored by Perfect Circle Piston Rings and Bill Slater served as the anchor. Sid Collins moved into the booth for the first time to serve as analyst, and conducted the victory lane interview at the conclusion of the race. The broadcast feature live coverage of the start, the finish, and live updates throughout the race.

Prior to the race, it was reported that Slater might miss the race, due to illness. WIBC personality Sid Collins was named as a replacement, however, Slater was able to arrive in time for race day. Collins, who had previously served as a turn reporter, was invited to be the co-anchor in the booth. For the first time, Collins interviewed the winner in victory lane at the conclusion of the race. Collins claims he burned his trousers on Parsons&#x27;s hot exhaust pipe during the interview, which took place in the rain.

Because the race was shortened, Mutual had to interrupt &quot;Queen for a Day&quot; to cover the finish of the abbreviated event. This was cited by some as a reason why the Speedway would begin flag-to-flag coverage in 1953.

===Television===
The race was carried live for the second year in a row on local television on WFBM-TV channel 6 of Indianapolis. Earl Townsend, Jr. was the announcer, along with Dick Pittenger and Paul Roberts. After the race, Speedway management disallowed WFBM from broadcasting the race live again, feeling that gate attendance had been negatively affected.

<text>The 1950 Swiss Grand Prix, formally titled the Großer Preis der Schweiz für Automobile, was a Formula One motor race held on 4 June 1950 at Bremgarten. It was race four of seven in the 1950 World Championship of Drivers. The 42-lap race was won by Alfa Romeo driver Nino Farina after he started from second position. His teammate Luigi Fagioli finished second and Talbot-Lago driver Louis Rosier came in third.

==Report==
The fourth round of the Championship took place just three weeks after the series began at Silverstone (with Monaco and Indianapolis having taken place on consecutive weekends). Once again the event proved to be a battle between the Alfa Romeo factory 158s of Giuseppe Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli and the Scuderia Ferraris of Alberto Ascari, Luigi Villoresi (who had the latest model with de Dion rear suspension, twin overhead camshaft engine and 4-speed gearbox), Raymond Sommer and Peter Whitehead. There were a number of uncompetitive Talbot-Lagos and Maseratis as usual. José Froilán González was out of action as a result of burns he had received after the first lap accident at Monaco Grand Prix. Also out of action as a result of the crash was Maserati factory driver Franco Rol. This was the last race to be entered by pre-war racer Eugène Martin. It was also the first and only World Championship Grand Prix for Nello Pagani, better known for his exploits in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. 

In qualifying Fangio and Farina were well clear of Fagioli with Villoresi and Ascari sharing the second row of the 3-2-3 grid. Peter Whitehead, Franco Rol, Reg Parnell and Rudi Fischer failed to qualify. In the race, on the first lap Ascari managed to get among the Alfa Romeos but he quickly slipped back and it was left to the Alfas to battle. Fangio led early on but then Farina went ahead through a faster refuelling stop. Fagioli was unable to keep up and after both Villoresi and Ascari retired. It was left to Prince Bira to run fourth. He had to refuel and so Philippe Étancelin in a Talbot-Lago was able to move into fourth place. Shortly afterwards, factory Talbot-Lago driver Eugène Martin crashed heavily and was seriously hurt when he was thrown from the car. Étancelin later went out with gearbox trouble and so Talbot-Lago factory driver Louis Rosier moved into fourth. He was promoted to third when Fangio retired on lap 33 with an electrical problem. Farina became the first driver to win multiples Grands Prix, after winning the inaugural World Championship Grand Prix. 

==Entries==
: — Nello Pagani qualified and drove all 39 laps of the race in the #2 Maserati. José Froilán González, named substitute driver for the car, was absent due to injury.

<text>The 1950 Belgian Grand Prix, formally titled the Grand Prix Automobile de Belgique, was a Formula One motor race held on 18 June 1950 at Spa-Francorchamps. It was race five of seven in the 1950 World Championship of Drivers. The 35-lap race was won by Alfa Romeo driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from second position. His teammate Luigi Fagioli finished second and Talbot-Lago driver Louis Rosier came in third.

==Report==
By the time of the Belgian Grand Prix, the pace of the season was beginning to tell, with only 14 cars arriving at the Spa circuit. These included the dominant Alfa Romeos of Nino Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli. Scuderia Ferrari was down to two 125s for Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari, although Ascari had a new V12 engine to try out. The factory Talbot-Lago team had three cars for Louis Rosier, Yves Giraud-Cabantous and Philippe Étancelin (standing in for the injured Eugène Martin). The rest of the field was made up of Talbot-Lagos (notably one for Raymond Sommer), a single Alta and one Maserati for Toni Branca. This race was the final entry for Geoffrey Crossley, the sport&#x27;s high costs forcing him, like many privateers, to retire after just a handful of races.

Farina and Fangio were fastest as usual in qualifying with Fagioli unable to match them. Sommer split the Ferraris in his old Talbot-Lago. The race would be a similar story. The Alfas went off on their own and Sommer battled with the two Ferraris. When the Alfa stopped for fuel, Sommer found himself in the unlikely position of being race leader. Unfortunately his engine blew up. Ascari took the lead but he had to stop for fuel and that meant that the Alfas went ahead again with Fangio leading Farina and Fagioli. Farina suffered transmission trouble in the closing laps and dropped to fourth behind the best of the surviving Talbot-Lagos being driven by Rosier. Ascari finished fifth.

<text>The 1950 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 2 July 1950 at Reims-Gueux. It was race 6 of 7 in the 1950 World Championship of Drivers. The 64-lap race was won by Alfa Romeo driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from pole position. His teammate Luigi Fagioli finished second and Peter Whitehead took third in a privateer Ferrari.

== Report ==
A total of 22 cars entered the event, four of which did not start the race. Franco Comotti did not attend the event; Eugène Chaboud did not start in his own car, instead sharing Philippe Étancelin&#x27;s Talbot-Lago; and the two Scuderia Ferrari entries of Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari withdrew in practice.

Fangio put in a stunning display with a 187 km/h (116 mph) practice lap. With Ferrari not starting their 3-litre cars, the main opposition was to come from the Talbots, complete with dual ignition engines with 12 spark plugs. However, they suffered from radiator problems and overheated, allowing Fangio and Fagioli to lead home another Alfa demonstration run, whilst Farina succumbed to fuel pump trouble. Peter Whitehead finished third despite a fractured head gasket in the last two laps.

== Entries ==
: — Philippe Étancelin qualified and drove 26 laps of the race in the #16 Talbot-Lago. Eugène Chaboud, who did not start the race despite qualifying in his own car, took over Étancelin&#x27;s vehicle for 33 laps of the race.
: — Charles Pozzi qualified and drove 14 laps of the race in the #26 Talbot-Lago. Louis Rosier, whose own car had already retired, took over #26 for 42 laps of the race.

==Entries==
: — Giovanni Bracco, Luigi de Filippis, Reg Parnell, Luigi Platé and Franco Bordoni all withdrew from the event prior to practice.
: — Dorino Serafini qualified and drove 47 laps of the race in the #48 Ferrari. Alberto Ascari, whose own vehicle had already retired, took over Serafini&#x27;s car for the remaining 33 laps of the race.
: — Piero Taruffi qualified and drove 25 laps of the race in the #60 Alfa Romeo. Juan Manuel Fangio, whose own Alfa had already retired, took over Taruffi&#x27;s car for a further 9 laps before again being forced to retire.

== Race report ==

Ferrari pulled out all the stops to impress at their home circuit, producing a new unsupercharged 4½ litre engine to try to end the Alfa Romeo monopoly. Alberto Ascari used it to achieve second place on the grid to Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s Alfa Romeo 158 and then in the race behind the fast starting Nino Farina (Alfa Romeo 158) before briefly leading. The pace was too punishing for the new car and a porous block broke on lap 20 and the battle returned as usual to the Alfas. Fangio retired twice; once in his own Alfa Romeo 158 and a second time after taking over Piero Taruffi&#x27;s. Farina led to the finish from Ascari who was now in teammate Dorino Serafini&#x27;s Ferrari 375 with Luigi Fagioli finishing third in his Alfa Romeo 158. Louis Rosier finish fourth in his Talbot-Lago T26C with Philippe Étancelin fifth in his Lago-Talbot. Étancelin would become the oldest driver to ever score a world championship point with that finish. Only seven cars finished out of the 27 starters and with Farina&#x27;s win and Fangio&#x27;s failure to score and Fagioli&#x27;s third place points removed as his worst scoring finish, Farina became the first recipient of the World Driver&#x27;s Championship crown.

<text>The 1951 Swiss Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 27 May 1951 in Bern. The race was contested over 42 laps of the Bremgarten Circuit with it also being the opening race of the 1951 World Championship of Drivers. The race was the eleventh time that the Swiss Grand Prix was held with all of the races being held at Bremgarten. 

After claiming pole position for the race, Argentine driver, Juan Manuel Fangio would go on win the race by 55 seconds over Italian driver, Piero Taruffi who drove for Ferrari. Fellow Italian driver, Nino Farina rounded out the podium in the second Alfa Romeo car.

==Report==
The Swiss Grand Prix, the first event of the 1951 World Championship due to the absence of Monaco from the calendar, saw the Alfa Romeo team continue their dominance of the previous season. All four of their drivers occupied positions on the front two rows of the grid; the highest non-Alfa qualifier was Ferrari&#x27;s Luigi Villoresi, who was alongside Fangio and Farina on the front row.

The race took place in the rain, with Fangio initially leading from Farina. Ferrari&#x27;s Piero Taruffi also challenged for the lead, having started from sixth on the grid. Fangio pitted, handing Nino Farina the lead for the 24th lap of the race. However, Farina&#x27;s decision not to make a pitstop did not pay off, as Fangio was able to retake the lead on lap 29. Fangio maintained the lead for the remainder of the race, eventually winning by nearly a minute from Taruffi, who had overtaken Farina on the penultimate lap. This was Taruffi&#x27;s first podium in just his second championship race. The remaining Alfa drivers—Consalvo Sanesi and Toulo de Graffenried—completed the points paying positions, ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Alberto Ascari, who competed despite suffering from burns from the previous weekend&#x27;s Formula 2 race in Genoa. Stirling Moss, driving for HWM, was in seventh, but ran out of fuel on the final lap, therefore yielding the position to Louis Chiron, who was driving a Maserati for Enrico Platé.

==Entries==
: — Consalvo Sanesi qualified and drove the entirety of the race in the #28 Alfa Romeo. Gianbattista Guidotti, named substitute driver, was not used during the Grand Prix.
: — Francis Rochat, Maurice Trintignant and André Simon all withdrew from the event prior to practice. Robert Manzon, who was entered in the #48 Simca Gordini alongside Trintignant, also withdrew.

<text>The 35th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Wednesday, May 30, 1951. The event was part of the 1951 AAA National Championship Trail, and was also race 2 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers. For the second year in a row, no European Formula One-based teams entered the race.

Duke Nalon, who had suffered serious burns in a crash in 1949, and who missed the 1950 race, made a comeback at Indy by winning the pole position in a Novi. Heavy attrition saw only eight cars running at the finish. Winner Lee Wallard&#x27;s car lost its brakes, suffered a damaged exhaust pipe, and broke a shock absorber mounting. In addition to the unbearably uncomfortable ride, Wallard had worn a fire retardant outfit, created by dipping his uniform in a mixture of borax crystals and water. Due to not wearing an undershirt, Wallard suffered serious chafing, and required treatment at the infield hospital after the victory lane celebration. It was estimated he lost 15 pounds during the race.

Wallard&#x27;s winning car had the smallest displacement in the field. About a week after winning the race, Wallard suffered severe burns in a crash at Reading, which effectively ended his professional racing career. Three-time winner Mauri Rose, in his 15th Indy start, crashed and flipped on lap 126. It was his final 500, as he retired from driving after the crash.

Wallard&#x27;s improbable victory helped earn him the nickname &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;.

==Time trials==
Time trials were scheduled for six days. Rain, however, pushed qualifying into a seventh day.

*Saturday May 12 – Pole Day time trials
*Sunday May 13 – Second day time trials
*Saturday May 19 – Third day time trials
*Sunday May 20 – Fourth day time trials
*Saturday May 26 – Fifth day time trials

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1951 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 8 on the 1951 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit, particularly since it was held only three day after the Swiss Grand Prix. Race winner Lee Wallard earned 9 points towards the World Championship (8 points for first place, and 1 point for the fastest lap). Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished seventh in the final season standings.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the radio through a network arrangement set up by 1070 WIBC-AM of Indianapolis. Mutual, which had carried the race for several years, had raised its advertising rates for 1951, and lost its primary sponsor for the event, Perfect Circle Piston Rings. As a result, Mutual dropped the coverage altogether. Local station WIBC stepped in to cover the race, and provided its feed to various Mutual affiliates. A total of 26 stations carried the broadcast.

WIBC personality Sid Collins served as the chief announcer in the booth, and the remainder of the crew consisted mostly of WIBC talent. Jim Shelton reported from his familiar turn four location, and Bill Fox was also in the booth. Easy Gwynn was also to be part of the crew. Collins interviewed the winner in victory lane, leaving Fox to call the actual finish of the race. Like the Mutual broadcasts, WIBC featured live coverage of the start (30 minutes), the finish (30 minutes), and 15-minute live updates throughout the race. The on-air crew was smaller than normal. There were not turn and pit reporters stationed around the entire track, instead recorded interviews were played back during later broadcast segments.

<text>The 1951 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 17 June 1951 at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 3 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers

==Report==

Despite there being just 13 starters, representing three makes of car, the race attracted a record crowd. There were a further three entries, including two Maseratis, which did not attend the event. Juan Manuel Fangio had a new suspension with special wheels, which had to be concave to make room for the brake drums. These proved an expensive novelty. At his first pit stop, they jammed and his stop lasted over 14 minutes. Giuseppe Farina&#x27;s Alfa Romeo dominated, holding off the Ferraris of Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi. A quick stop of 39 seconds for wheel change and refuelling preserved his lead until the finish.

This would eventually prove to be the only Grand Prix in Fangio&#x27;s entire Formula 1 career, barring retirements, that he finished outside of the top four. He scored a point for posting the fastest lap of the race, which meant that despite having finished in ninth place (only the top five finishers scored points), he kept his record of scoring points in every single race he finished.

<text>The 1951 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims-Gueux on 1 July 1951. It was race 4 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers and was won by Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli driving an Alfa Romeo. It was the first of three occasions where two drivers would be credited with a Grand Prix win after sharing a car.

The race, which also carried the honorific title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot;, saw the World Championship debuts of Aldo Gordini, André Simon and Onofre Marimón. Fagioli&#x27;s victory, his first in a World Championship race, made him the oldest driver to win a World Championship Grand Prix, a record he still holds. This race also holds the record for the longest Formula One Grand Prix in terms of total distance needed to cover. 77 laps of the 4.856 mile Reims-Gueux circuit totaled to 373.961 miles.

==Report==
About 10 laps into the race, the engine in Fangio&#x27;s car began misfiring, so he stopped at the pits to have the magneto changed, but only completed one further lap before stopping again. Around this time, the gearbox in Ascari&#x27;s Ferrari had broken, and he retired, although he took over the car of González, who had been pushing very hard. When Fagioli came in for his fuel stop, the team ordered Fagioli and Fangio to swap cars; Fagioli&#x27;s car was running healthily whereas Fangio&#x27;s car had multiple mechanical problems. Fuel stops and problems for the Ferraris enabled Fangio to make his way into the lead and win the race, with Ascari in González&#x27;s original car finishing 2nd, 52 seconds behind. Fagioli, in Fangio&#x27;s original car, finished 11th, 22 laps behind. Fagioli, a veteran racing driver who had been racing Grand Prix cars since the 1920s and known for his fiery temperament was so furious over handing his car over to Fangio that he quit Grand Prix racing on the spot; he only raced this one championship race in 1951 and had not competed at the previous rounds at Bern and Spa.

<text>Into the Wild is a 1996 non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It is an expansion of a 9,000-word article by Krakauer on Chris McCandless titled &quot;Death of an Innocent&quot;, which appeared in the January 1993 issue of &quot;Outside&quot;. The book was adapted to a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Sean Penn with Emile Hirsch starring as McCandless. &quot;Into the Wild&quot; is an international bestseller that has been printed in 30 languages and 173 editions and formats. The book is widely used as high school and college reading curriculum. &quot;Into the Wild&quot; has been lauded by many reviewers, and in 2019 was listed by &quot;Slate&quot; as one of the 50 best nonfiction works of the past quarter-century.

==Background==
Christopher Johnson McCandless grew up in suburban Annandale, Virginia. After graduating in May 1990 with high grades from Emory University, McCandless ceased communicating with his family, gave away his college fund of $24,500 to Oxfam, and began traveling across the Western United States, later abandoning his 1982 Datsun B210 after a flash flood.

On April 28, 1992, McCandless hitchhiked to the Stampede Trail in Alaska. There he headed down the snow-covered trail to begin an odyssey with only 10 pounds (4500 g) of rice, a .22 caliber rifle, several boxes of rifle rounds, a camera, and a small selection of reading material—including a field guide to the region&#x27;s edible plants, &quot;Tana&#x27;ina Plantlore&quot;. He declined an acquaintance&#x27;s offer to buy him sturdier clothing and better supplies. McCandless died sometime around the week of August 18, 1992, after surviving for 113 days.

==Summary==
On September 6, 1992, Christopher McCandless&#x27;s body was found in an abandoned bus at on the Stampede Trail in Alaska. One year later, author Jon Krakauer retraced McCandless&#x27;s steps during the two years between college graduation and his demise in Alaska. McCandless shed his legal name early in his journey, adopting the moniker &quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot;, after W.H. Davies. He spent time in Carthage, South Dakota, laboring for months in a grain elevator owned by Wayne Westerberg before hitchhiking to Alaska in April 1992. Krakauer interprets McCandless&#x27;s intensely ascetic personality as possibly influenced by the writings of Henry David Thoreau and McCandless&#x27;s favorite writer, Jack London. He explores the similarities between McCandless&#x27;s experiences and motivations, and his own as a young man, recounting in detail Krakauer&#x27;s own attempt to climb Devils Thumb in Alaska. Krakauer also relates the stories of some other young men who vanished into the wilderness, such as Everett Ruess and Carl McCunn. In addition, he describes at some length the grief and puzzlement of McCandless&#x27;s parents, sister Carine, and friends.

===Cause of death===
McCandless survived for approximately 113 days in the Alaskan wilderness, foraging for edible roots and berries, shooting an assortment of game—including a moose—and keeping a journal. Although he planned to hike to the coast, the boggy terrain of summer proved too difficult, and he decided instead to live in a derelict camping bus left behind by a road construction company. In July he tried to leave, only to find the route blocked by the Teklanika River raging with snow-melt. On July 30, McCandless wrote a journal entry which read, &quot;Extremely Weak. Fault Of Pot[ato] Seed&quot;. Based on this entry, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless had been eating what he thought was the roots of an edible plant, &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot;, commonly known as wild Eskimo potato, which are sweet and nourishing in the spring but become too tough to eat in the summer, perhaps forcing McCandless to eat the H. alpinum&#x27;s seeds instead. Krakauer first speculated that the seeds were actually from &quot;Hedysarum mackenzii&quot;, or wild sweet pea, instead of the Eskimo potato, which contained a poisonous alkaloid, possibly swainsonine (the toxic chemical in locoweed) or something similar. In addition to neurological symptoms, such as weakness and loss of coordination, the poison causes starvation by blocking nutrient metabolism in the body. However, Krakauer later suggested that McCandless had not confused the two plants and had in fact actually eaten &quot;H. alpinum&quot;. Krakauer had the &quot;H. alpinum&quot; seeds tested and it was found to contain an unidentifiable form of toxin.

According to Krakauer, a well-nourished person might consume the seeds and survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless was likely unable to fend off the toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety &quot;Rhizoctonia leguminicola&quot; may have caused McCandless&#x27;s death. &quot;Rhizoctonia leguminicola&quot; is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have contributed to McCandless&#x27;s impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable to get out of bed and thus, starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.

In March 2015, Krakauer co-authored a scientific analysis of the &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds McCandless ate. The report found relatively high levels of L-canavanine (an antimetabolite toxic to mammals) in the &quot;H. alpinum&quot; seeds and concluded &quot;it is highly likely that the consumption of H. alpinum seeds contributed to the death of Chris McCandless.&quot;

== Major themes ==
&quot;Into the Wild&quot; addresses the issues of how to be accepted into society, and how finding oneself sometimes conflicts with being an active member in society. Most critics agree that Chris McCandless left to find some sort of enlightenment. He also tries to find his way in the wild with minimal material possessions, because &quot;it made the journey more enjoyable.&quot; His extreme risk-taking was the calling that eventually led to his downfall.

McCandless was influenced by transcendentalism and the need to &quot;revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Despite its critical acclaim, the book&#x27;s accuracy has been disputed by some of those involved in McCandless&#x27; story, and by some commentators such as Alaskan reporter Craig Medred. Medred covers a large number of items in the book that are questionable, most of which stem from the extremely limited detail in McCandless&#x27; journal. He concludes that Krakauer had to infer or invent much of McCandless&#x27; experiences. Krakauer was criticized for presenting his speculation as fact. Additionally, weather records refute some of the dramatic weather events presented in the story.

==Adaptations==

A film adaptation was released in September 2007, directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless.

McCandless&#x27;s story is also the subject of the documentary by Ron Lamothe named &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (2007). In his study of McCandless&#x27;s death, Lamothe concludes that McCandless ran out of supplies and game, and starved to death, instead of being poisoned by eating the seeds of the wild potato.

The Christopher Johnson McCandless Memorial Foundation, headed by McCandless&#x27;s parents Billie and Walt, with the editorial and writing input of family and friends, released the book and DVD &quot;Back to the Wild: The Photographs &amp; Writings of Christopher McCandless&quot; (2010). The material includes hundreds of McCandless&#x27;s previously unseen pictures and journal entries. Jon Krakauer has written a piece in the book&#x27;s introduction, while Hal Holbrook—who appeared in the Penn film—narrates the DVD.

== Bus exhibit ==
The bus that McCandless died in became a tourist attraction after the book became popular. The bus was removed on June 18, 2020 due to tourists endangering themselves in the Alaskan wilderness. Members of the Alaska National Guard airlifted the bus to an undisclosed location, and then on September 24, 2020, the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks announced the permanent display of the bus.

<text>The 1951 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 14 July 1951 at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England. It was race 5 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers and was contested over 90 laps. The race was the first victory for José Froilán González, and was also the first of many for the Scuderia Ferrari team. Both the team and driver also achieved their first ever pole position during the weekend.

==Report==
José Froilán González was one second quicker than Juan Manuel Fangio in qualifying, achieving the first pole position of his career. It was also the first pole position for the Ferrari team, and the first in the World Championship (excluding the Indy 500 races) not scored by an Alfa Romeo. Nino Farina and Alberto Ascari qualified in third and fourth positions, completing the front row.

González and Fangio shot away almost parallel from the front row of the grid, closely followed by the other Alfa Romeos and Ferraris. Alfa Romeo driver Felice Bonetto, who started in seventh position, was the first man at the first corner, with the Ferrari of González in second position. González took the lead from Bonetto on the second lap with Fangio chasing. The BRM cars of Reg Parnell and Peter Walker were in hot pursuit of the leaders. The team had arrived at the last minute, and had not practiced or even qualified for their debut race, and had started in 19th and 20th positions. Bonetto&#x27;s Alfa Romeo teammates of Fangio and reigning World Champion, Nino Farina, managed to overtake him to move into second and third places. On lap 6, Fangio began to close in on González; he passed him on the straight on lap 10, and slowly began to draw away. Consalvo Sanesi then pulled into the pits for fuel and new tyres.

The Maserati of John James became the first retirement of the race on lap 23 with a radiator problem, but was soon joined on the sidelines by Louis Chiron, both his Maserati teammates, the Ferrari of Alberto Ascari and Farina. Farina pulled up at Abbey curve after 75 laps with a slipping clutch and his engine on fire. He had set the lap record on lap 38, with a time of 1 minute 44 seconds, an average speed of 100.0003981  mph,(some sources state 99.997382 mph) ensuring he still left the weekend with one point. González retook the lead on lap 39 with an overtake at Becketts corner. He kept his lead for the remainder of the race (excluding one lap when he pitted just before Fangio did) extending it to 1 minute and 5 seconds with 5 laps to go, before easing off at the end of the race. The BRM drivers of Parnell and Walker were still battling on, despite the fact they were suffering from hand and feet burns, and would eventually finish fifth and seventh respectively.

The Alfa Romeos of Fangio and Farina pitted twice for fuel, owing to the awful fuel consumption of their cars. They were doing miles to the gallon, and needed to take on 90 gallons for every stop. Both drivers needed to stop twice, and, owing to the lengthy, minutes-long pit stops of Formula One in 1951, the more fuel efficient Ferrari of González (who only needed to make one stop) was able to overtake the Alfa Romeos and pull out a considerable lead.

González eventually took his own and Ferrari&#x27;s first victory in a World Championship race by 51 seconds. It was the first World Championship race (excluding the Indy 500) that was not won by an Alfa Romeo. An Alfa Romeo was still in second place though, in the form of the year&#x27;s eventual champion Fangio. Luigi Villoresi became the second Ferrari on the podium after he finished in third place, two laps behind. Bonetto and Parnell were the other two-point scorers at the race, finishing in fourth and fifth positions respectively.

As it turned out, González had actually raced with an older chassis and engine than his teammates, Villoresi and Ascari.

<text>The 1951 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 29 July 1951 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. It was race 6 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers.

==Report==
Alfa Romeo once again fielded four cars, with local driver Paul Pietsch replacing Consalvo Sanesi, joining Fangio, Farina and Bonetto. Following on from their maiden victory at Silverstone, Ferrari also entered four drivers. Piero Taruffi rejoined their lineup, alongside Ascari, Villoresi and British Grand Prix winner José Froilán González. Ferrari continued their good form from the previous event, with Ascari and González the fastest two qualifiers. Fangio and Farina completed the front row, with Villoresi, Taruffi and Pietsch making up the second row.

Nino Farina initially took the lead, but, by the end of the first lap, had been passed by Fangio, Ascari and González. Paul Pietsch was running in fifth, but ended up at the back of the field after going off on the second lap. When Farina was forced to retire due to overheating problems, Fangio was left as the sole Alfa Romeo able to take the fight to the Ferrari drivers. Alberto Ascari took the lead on the fifth lap as a result of Fangio&#x27;s first pitstop, but Fangio returned to the lead when Ascari took to the pits. As the Alfas required two pitstops, as opposed to just one for the Ferraris, Fangio needed to build a large lead in his second stint if he wanted to retain the lead after his second stop. He was unable to do so, therefore Ascari reclaimed the lead on the fifteenth lap of the race. Due to a misbehaving engine and a gearbox with only 3rd and 4th (4th being the highest gear), Fangio was unable to take advantage of an unexpected tyre change for Ascari, meaning that the Italian took his maiden World Championship race victory by over half a minute from Fangio. González completed the podium, with the remaining points positions going to the other works Ferraris of Villoresi and Taruffi.

Ascari&#x27;s victory took him to second in the Championship standings, ten points adrift of Fangio, who extended his lead from the previous race. After his second consecutive podium, José Froilán González moved up to third in the standings, level on points with Farina and Villoresi.

<text>The 1951 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 16 September 1951 at Monza. It was race 7 of 8 in the 1951 World Championship of Drivers.

==Report==

Toulo de Graffenried returned to Alfa Romeo&#x27;s four-car line up, in place of Paul Pietsch, having raced for Enrico Platé in France and Germany. He raced alongside the regular Alfa drivers, Fangio, Farina and Bonetto. The works Ferrari team retained the same four drivers from the race at the Nürburgring — Ascari, Villoresi, González and Taruffi — while Brazilian Chico Landi made his World Championship debut in a privately run Ferrari. The field was completed by works teams from BRM, Simca-Gordini and OSCA, as well as the usual Talbot-Lago entries.

The front row positions on the grid were shared equally between Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, with Fangio, Farina, Ascari and González posting the four fastest qualifying times. The second row consisted of the remaining works Ferraris of Villoresi and Taruffi, alongside Felice Bonetto. Reg Parnell, in a BRM, was also supposed to be on the second row, but was unable to start due to lubrication problems.

Fangio was the initial race leader, having started from pole position, but he soon had to cede the position to Ascari. He retook the lead on lap eight before pitting for a tyre change, which dropped him to fifth. Early retirements for Farina and de Graffenried left José Froilán González in second, behind his teammate Ascari. Fangio attempted to bridge the gap to the Ferraris, but engine problems eliminated his chances. The sole remaining Alfa driver, Nino Farina, who had taken over Bonetto&#x27;s car on lap 30, inherited third place as a result of Fangio&#x27;s retirement. He was fast, but fuel leakages meant that he needed to make two further pitstops; he therefore had to settle for third. Alberto Ascari took his second, and Ferrari&#x27;s third, consecutive Championship race victory, ahead of British Grand Prix winner González. The other works Ferraris of Villoresi and Taruffi completed the points positions in what was another successful race for the Scuderia.

Ascari&#x27;s victory took him to within two points of Championship leader Fangio, while González was a further four points behind in third.
==Entries==
: — Gianni Marzotto withdrew from the event prior to practice
: — Ken Richardson qualified the #32 BRM, although he did not start the race. Hans Stuck was also entered in the same car, but he took no part in either qualifying or the race.
: — Toulo de Graffenried qualified and drove the race in the #36 Alfa Romeo. Consalvo Sanesi was also entered in the car, but injury prevented his participation in the Grand Prix.
: — Felice Bonetto qualified and drove 29 laps of the race in the #40 Alfa Romeo. Nino Farina, whose own vehicle had already retired, took over the car for a further 50 laps.
: — Maurice Trintignant qualified the #50 Simca-Gordini but was secretly replaced for the race by Jean Behra.

<text>The Will to Power () is a book of notes drawn from the literary remains (or &quot;Nachlass&quot;) of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche by his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and Peter Gast (Heinrich Köselitz). The title derived from a work that Nietzsche himself had considered writing. The work was first translated into English by Anthony M. Ludovici in 1910, and it has since seen several other translations and publications.

After Nietzsche&#x27;s breakdown in 1889, and the passing of control over his literary estate to his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, Nietzsche&#x27;s friend Heinrich Köselitz, also known as Peter Gast, conceived the notion of publishing selections from his notebooks, using one of Nietzsche&#x27;s simpler outlines as a guide to their arrangement. As he explained to Elisabeth on November 8, 1893:

:Given that the original title appears as: &quot;The Antichrist. Revaluation of All Values&quot; (and therefore not &#x27;The first book of the revaluation of all values&#x27;), you may think that your brother at the time of his incipient madness, thought the book completed. ... Notwithstanding, the consequences of this revaluation must also be explicitly illustrated in the field of morality, philosophy, politics. No one today is able to imagine such consequences – that&#x27;s why the vast preparations by your brother, the other three books of the &quot;Revaluation&quot;, must be ordered according to my suggestion and gathered in a kind of system.

Between 1894 and 1926, Elisabeth arranged the publication of the twenty volume &quot;Großoktavausgabe&quot; edition of Nietzsche&#x27;s writings by C. G. Naumann. In it, following Köselitz&#x27;s suggestion she included a selection from Nietzsche&#x27;s posthumous fragments, which was gathered together and entitled &quot;The Will To Power&quot;. She claimed that this text was substantially the &quot;magnum opus&quot;, which Nietzsche had hoped to write and name &quot;The Will to Power, An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values&quot;. The first German edition, containing 483 sections, published in 1901, was edited by Köselitz, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer, under Elisabeth&#x27;s direction. This version was superseded in 1906 by an expanded second edition containing 1067 sections. This later compilation is what has come to be commonly known as &quot;The Will to Power&quot;.

==Colli and Montinari research==
While researching materials for the Italian translation of Nietzsche&#x27;s complete works in the 1960s, the philologists Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari decided to go to the Archives in Leipzig to work with the original documents. From their work emerged the first complete and chronological edition of Nietzsche&#x27;s writings, including the posthumous fragments from which Förster-Nietzsche had assembled &quot;The Will To Power&quot;. The complete works comprise 5,000 pages, compared to the 3,500 pages of the &quot;Großoktavausgabe&quot;. In 1964, during the International Colloquium on Nietzsche in Paris, Colli and Montinari met Karl Löwith, who would put them in contact with Heinz Wenzel, editor for Walter de Gruyter&#x27;s publishing house. Heinz Wenzel would buy the rights of the complete works of Colli and Montinari (33 volumes in German) &quot;after&quot; the French Gallimard edition and the Italian Adelphi editions.

Before Colli and Montinari&#x27;s philological work, the previous editions led readers to believe that Nietzsche had organized all his work toward a final structured &quot;opus&quot; called &quot;The Will to Power&quot;. In fact, if Nietzsche did consider producing such a book, he had abandoned such plans in the months before his collapse. The title of &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, which appears for the first time at the end of the summer of 1885, was replaced by another plan at the end of August 1888. This new plan was titled &quot;Attempt at a revaluation of all values&quot; [Versuch einer Umwerthung aller Werthe], and ordered the multiple fragments in a completely different way than the one chosen by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche.

Mazzino Montinari and Giorgio Colli have called &quot;The Will to Power&quot; a &quot;historic forgery&quot; artificially assembled by Nietzsche&#x27;s sister and Köselitz/Gast. Although Nietzsche had in 1886 announced (at the end of &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;) a new work with the title, &quot;The Will to Power: An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values&quot;, the project under this title was set aside and some of its draft materials used to compose &quot;The Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (both written in 1888, see &quot;Magnum in parvo: A philosophy in compendium&quot;); the latter was for a time represented as the first part of a new four-part magnum opus, which inherited the subtitle &quot;Revaluation of All Values&quot; from the earlier project as its new title. Although Elisabeth Förster called &quot;The Will to Power&quot; Nietzsche&#x27;s unedited &quot;magnum opus&quot;, in light of Nietzsche&#x27;s collapse, his intentions for the material he had not by that time put to use in &quot;The Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot; are simply unknowable. So &quot;The Will to Power&quot; was not a text completed by Nietzsche, but rather an anthology of selections from his notebooks misrepresented as if it were something more. Nevertheless, the concept remains, and has, since the reading of Karl Löwith, been identified as a key component of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy although many believe so erroneously, so much so that Heidegger, under Löwith&#x27;s influence, considered it to form, with the &quot;thought of the eternal recurrence&quot;, the basis of his thought.

In fact, according to Montinari, not only did the &quot;Will To Power&quot; impose its own order on the fragments, but many individual fragments were themselves cut up or stitched together in ways not made clear to the reader. Gilles Deleuze himself saluted Montinari&#x27;s work declaring:

:As long as it was not possible for the most serious researcher to accede to the whole of Nietzsche&#x27;s manuscripts, we knew only in a loose way that the &quot;Will to Power&quot; did not exist as such (...) We wish only now that the new dawn brought on by this previously unpublished work will be the sign of a return to Nietzsche.

Drawing on this research for support, Montinari also called into question the very conception of a Nietzschean &quot;magnum opus&quot;, given his style of writing and thinking.

==Further research==
In 2006, Thomas H. Brobjer stated in the abstract to his study, Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;:

Nietzsche did not write a completed magnum opus, a &quot;Hauptwerk&quot;, but he planned to do so during at least the last 5 years of his active life. I will show that during and after the writing of &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; this was his main aim and ambition. The projected work passed through a number of related phases, of which the much discussed and controversial &quot;Will to Power&quot; was merely one. This intention to write a &quot;magnum opus&quot; has been denied or almost completely ignored by almost all commentators (and even the many writers of Nietzsche biographies). I will bring attention to this intention, discuss why it has been ignored and show that an awareness of it is important for our understanding of the late Nietzsche&#x27;s thinking and for determining the value and originality of his late notes. It has been a failure of historians of philosophy, intellectual historians and Nietzsche scholars not to have taken this into consideration and account.

Since Nietzsche asked his landlord to burn some of his notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria, and these notes were ultimately incorporated into the compilation &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, some scholars argue that Nietzsche rejected his project on the will to power at the end of his lucid life. However, a recent study (Huang 2019) shows that the &quot;burning&quot; story indicates little about Nietzsche&#x27;s project on the will to power, not only because only 11 “aphorisms” saved from the flames were published in &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, but also because these abandoned notes mainly focus on topics such as the critique of morality while touching upon the “feeling of power” only once.

<text>The 1951 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 28 October 1951 at Pedralbes Circuit. It was the eighth and final race of the 1951 World Championship of Drivers.

This race was determined by tyre choice – Ferrari chose a 16-inch rear wheel, whilst Alfa Romeo settled for the 18 inch, which proved to be the better of the two options.
Juan Manuel Fangio led Alberto Ascari by two points before the race. Ascari led the race from José Froilán González, but the Ferraris suffered numerous tread problems. Piero Taruffi threw a tyre tread on lap 6 and was followed on lap 7 by Luigi Villoresi, Ascari on lap 8 and Gonzalez on lap 14. The Ferraris were forced to stop frequently to change tyres and Fangio comfortably won the race and his first drivers&#x27; title, after Ascari finished 4th was not able to overhaul Fangio&#x27;s total. After the race, Alfa Romeo announced that due to lack of finances, they would not be competing in the 1952 season.

==Entries==
: — Peter Whitehead and Reg Parnell both withdrew from the event prior to practice.
: — Juan Jover qualified in the #46 Maserati, although he did not start the race. Joaquin Palacio had been entered in car #46, but he withdrew prior to practice.
: — Toni Branca withdrew from the event prior to practice. Chico Landi had also been entered in car #48, but he too withdrew from the Grand Prix before practice.

<text>The 1952 Swiss Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 18 May 1952 at Bremgarten Circuit. It was the first round of the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used.

Pre-WWII Grand Prix great Rudolf Caracciola crashed heavily during a support sports car race. He survived with a broken leg, but this crash effectively ended his racing career. He was driving a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL; his brakes locked up going into a corner and the car skidded off the road and hit a tree.

Italian driver Piero Taruffi scored his only win in a World Championship race, driving for Ferrari.

==Report==
With the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from the World Championship, Ferrari were left as the sole competitive team under the existing Formula One regulations. It was therefore decided to restrict the World Championship Grand Prix races to Formula Two cars.

The works Ferrari team brought three drivers to the Swiss Grand Prix, namely Farina, Taruffi and Simon. Regular Ferrari drivers Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi were both unavailable, the former due to his participation in the Indianapolis 500, and the latter because of his having had a road accident. Also running Ferraris were Rudi Fischer and Peter Hirt of Ecurie Espadon, and veteran Frenchman Louis Rosier. Gordini also had a three-car team for this race, consisting of Robert Manzon, B. Bira and the debutant Jean Behra. The HWM team, returning to the World Championship for the first time since the previous race at Bremgarten, fielded the all-British quartet of Abecassis, Collins, Macklin and Moss. Maserati had planned to enter defending World Drivers&#x27; Champion Juan Manuel Fangio and fellow Argentinian José Froilán González, but this did not come into fruition. Completing the field were the sole AFM entry of Hans Stuck and a number of privately run cars representing various constructors.

Former Alfa Romeo driver Nino Farina took pole position, alongside Taruffi and Manzon on the front row of the grid. Simon and Fischer started from the second row, in front of Collins, Behra and Toulo de Graffenried, who was driving an Enrico Platé-entered Maserati.

Polesitter Farina led the race until his car broke down. His Ferrari teammate assumed the lead, which he held for the remainder of the race. Moss was impressively running in third place in the early stages, behind Farina and Taruffi, before he had to stop. Moss and Macklin withdrew from the race. The main battle was between Behra and Simon, for second place (once Farina had retired). When Behra had to stop, due to his exhaust pipe having fallen off, Farina, who had taken over Simon&#x27;s car, assumed second place. However, further problems meant that he once again had to retire, on lap 51, handing second to local driver Rudi Fischer. The Swiss driver took his first Championship podium, being the only driver not to be lapped by Taruffi, who took his first (and only) World Championship race victory. Behra completed the podium, taking third on debut, while Ken Wharton (fourth) and Alan Brown (fifth) took the first points finishes for Frazer Nash and Cooper, respectively.

==Entries==
: — André Simon qualified and drove 21 laps of the race in the #32 Ferrari. Nino Farina, whose own vehicle had already retired, took over the car for a further 30 laps before again being forced to retire.
: — Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán González, whose cars were unavailable, withdrew from the event prior to practice.
: — Peter Hirt qualified and drove the entire race in the #44 Ferrari. Rudolf Schoeller, named substitute driver for the car, was not used during the Grand Prix.
: — Max de Terra drove the #50 Simca-Gordini in the race. Alfred Dattner, who was also entered in the same car, was unable to take part in the Grand Prix due to illness.

<text>The 36th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was a motor race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1952. It was the opening race of the 1952 AAA National Championship Trail and was also race 2 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers.

Troy Ruttman won the race for car owner J. C. Agajanian. Ruttman, aged 22 years and 80 days, set the record for the youngest 500 winner in history. It was also the last dirt track car to win at Indy. Ruttman&#x27;s win also saw him become the youngest winner of a World Drivers&#x27; Championship race, a record he would hold for 51 years until the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix when Spanish driver Fernando Alonso won at the age of 22 years and 26 days.

Bill Vukovich led 150 laps, but with 9 laps to go, he broke a steering linkage while leading. He nursed his car to a stop against the outside wall, preventing other cars from getting involved in the incident.

In the third year that the 500 was included in the World Championship, Ferrari entered the race with Alberto Ascari driving a Ferrari 375 Indianapolis. The effort gained considerable attention, but Ascari was forced to retire after a few laps when the hub of a wheel on his car collapsed. He was classified 31st. It was the only World Championship race in 1952 that Ascari entered and did not win.

Fifth place finisher Art Cross was voted the Rookie of the Year. Though at least one rookie starter was in the field every year dating back to 1911, this was the first time the now-popular award was officially designated.

===Race statistics===



== Notes ==
* Pole position: Fred Agabashian – 4:20.85 (4 laps)
* Agabashian&#x27;s Cummins Diesel Special was the first entry in the Indianapolis 500 to be powered by a turbocharged engine (then described as &quot;turbosupercharged&quot;). Gear-driven centrifugal blowers known as &quot;superchargers&quot; had been used since the 1920s to increase the volumetric efficiency and power output of racing engines, but the Cummins Diesel was the first to make use of the &quot;free&quot; energy contained in the engine exhaust stream to drive a turbine wheel connected to a centrifugal blower (thus, &quot;turbo-supercharging&quot;).
* Fastest Lead Lap: Bill Vukovich – 1:06.60 (135.135 mph)
* As of 2022, Troy Ruttman remains the youngest driver to win the Indianapolis 500, at 22 years and 80 days.
* Ruttman also became the youngest driver to win a race counting for the World Championship of Drivers. His record was broken by Fernando Alonso at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* 1952 was the only occasion when the fastest (Chet Miller) and slowest (Jim Rigsby) qualifiers for the race started next to each other.
* 1952 was the first Indy 500 in which not a single relief driver was utilized during the race.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the radio on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. During the offseason, the Speedway management created the network to handle broadcasting duties in-house. The arrangement was under the flagship of 1070 WIBC-AM of Indianapolis, and featured a crew that consisted mostly of WIBC talent. WIBC landed exclusive rights of the broadcast in the Indianapolis market, which eventually would draw the ire of the other major stations in the area. In later years, the broadcast would be carried on all five stations inside the city, and they would utilize talent and crew representing each station.

Sid Collins served as booth announcer. Jim Shelton was among the turn reporters, reporting from turn 4. Gordon Graham reported from the pits and from victory lane. Like previous years, the broadcast featured live coverage of the start, the finish, and 15-minute live updates throughout the race. At least twenty stations around the county picked up the broadcast.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1952 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 8 of the 1952 World Championship. Alberto Ascari, driving for Ferrari, competed in the race. He became the first European-based driver who was seriously competing for the World Championship to come to Indianapolis to race in the 500. In doing so, Ascari skipped the Swiss Grand Prix. He dropped out early and finished 31st. He failed to score any points, but he would go on to win the remaining seven races and won the world title. Race winner Troy Ruttman earned 8 points towards the World Championship and finished seventh in the final season standings.
