<text>Central Arkansas, also known as the Little Rock metro, designated by the United States Office of Management and Budget as the Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area, is the most populous metro area in the U.S. state of Arkansas. With an estimated 2020 population of 748,031, it is the most populated area in Arkansas. Located at the convergence of Arkansas&#x27;s other geographic regions, the region&#x27;s central location make Central Arkansas an important population, economic, education, and political center in Arkansas and the South. Little Rock is the state&#x27;s capital and largest city, and the city is also home to two Fortune 500 companies, Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital, and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).

==History==
The site known as &quot;little rock&quot; along the Arkansas River was found by explorer Bernard de la Harpe in 1722. The territorial capitol had been located at Arkansas Post in Southeast Arkansas since 1819, but the site had proven unsuitable as a settlement due to frequent flooding of the Arkansas River. Over the years, the &quot;little rock&quot; was known as a waypoint along the river, but remained unsettled. A land speculator from St. Louis, Missouri who had acquired many acres around the &quot;little rock&quot; began pressuring the Arkansas territorial legislature in February 1820 to move the capital to the site, but the representatives could not decide between Little Rock or Cadron (now Conway), which was the preferred site of Territorial Governor James Miller. The issue was tabled until October 1820, by which time most of the legislators and other influential men had purchased lots around Little Rock. The legislature moved the capital to Little Rock, where it has remained ever since.

==Geography==

Central Arkansas is located in the Southern United States (commonly known as the South in the US), and within a subregion commonly known as the Deep South, although it is influenced by Upper South culture. The South is a distinct cultural region reliant upon a plantation economy in the 18th and 19th century, until the secession of the Confederate States of America and the Civil War.

The region is the point of convergence for five other Arkansas regions: the Ozarks to the north, the Arkansas River Valley &amp; the Ouachita Mountains to the west, the Arkansas Delta to the east, and Piney Woods to the southwest.

The Arkansas River crosses the region, and serves as the dividing line between Little Rock and North Little Rock. The Arkansas is an important geographic feature in Central Arkansas, requiring long bridge spans but allowing barge traffic to the Port of Little Rock and points upriver.

==Demographics==
Central Arkansas includes both the Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway MSA, though the broader Little Rock CSA is also considered Central Arkansas. The MSA is defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget as Faulkner, Grant, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski and Saline counties. The CSA definition adds the Pine Bluff metropolitan area adding Cleveland, Jefferson, and Lincoln counties, and the Searcy Micropolitan Area, which adds White County, and the Hot Springs metropolitan area, which adds Garland County.

It is the core of the broader Little Rock-North Little Rock Combined Statistical Area (CSA). Its economic, cultural, and demographic center is Little Rock, Arkansas&#x27;s capital and largest city. The Little Rock Combined Statistical area spans ten counties and had an estimated population of 905,847 in 2016.

Prior to 2002, the area consisted of four core counties: Pulaski, Faulkner, Saline and Lonoke. The area was later expanded to include adjoining Perry County to the west, and Grant County to the south. The city of Conway was designated as a third principal city for the MSA by 2007.

<text>Bond triangles or Van Arkel–Ketelaar triangles (named after Anton Eduard van Arkel and J. A. A. Ketelaar) are triangles used for showing different compounds in varying degrees of ionic, metallic and covalent bonding.

== History ==

In 1941 Van Arkel recognised three extreme materials and associated bonding types. Using 36 main group elements, such as metals, metalloids and non-metals, he placed ionic, metallic and covalent bonds on the corners of an equilateral triangle, as well as suggested intermediate species. The bond triangle shows that chemical bonds are not just particular bonds of a specific type. Rather, bond types are interconnected and different compounds have varying degrees of different bonding character (for example, covalent bonds with significant ionic character are called polar covalent bonds).

Six years later, in 1947, Ketelaar developed van Arkel&#x27;s idea by adding more compounds and placing bonds on different sides of the triangle.

Many people developed the triangle idea. Some (e.g. Allen&#x27;s quantitative triangle) used electron configuration energy as an atom parameter, others (Jensen&#x27;s quantitative triangle, Norman&#x27;s quantitative triangle) used electronegativity of compounds. Nowadays, electronegativity triangles are mostly used to rate the chemical bond type.

== Usage ==

Different compounds that obey the octet rule (sp-elements) and hydrogen can be placed on the triangle. Unfortunately, d-elements cannot be analysed using van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle, as their electronegativity is so high that it is taken as a constant. Using electronegativity - two compound average electronegativity on x-axis and electronegativity difference on y-axis, we can rate the dominant bond between the compounds. Example is here

On the right side (from ionic to covalent) should be compounds with varying difference in electronegativity. The compounds with equal electronegativity, such as Cl2 (chlorine) are placed in the covalent corner, while the ionic corner has compounds with large electronegativity difference, such as NaCl (table salt). The bottom side (from metallic to covalent) contains compounds with varying degree of directionality in the bond.

At one extreme is metallic bonds with delocalized bonding and the other are covalent bonds in which the orbitals overlap in a particular direction. The left side (from ionic to metallic) is meant for delocalized bonds with varying electronegativity difference.

<doc id="1145421" wikidata="Q163061" url="?curid=1145421" title="Valentin Adamberger">
<text>Valentin Adamberger, also known by his Italian name Adamonti, (22 February 1740 or 6 July 174324 August 1804) was a German operatic tenor. His voice was universally admired for its pliancy, agility, and precision, and several composers of note, such as Mozart, wrote music specifically for him.

==Biography==
Adamberger was born either in Rohr, Bavaria in 1740 or in Munich in 1743. Beginning in 1755, he studied singing with Johann Walleshauser (also known as Giovanni Valesi) while at the &quot;&quot;, a Jesuit institution in Munich. In 1760, he joined the &quot;Kapelle&quot; of Duke Clemens and upon the Duke&#x27;s death in 1770 was taken into the Elector&#x27;s Hofkapelle. He made his opera début at Munich in 1772. This was the beginning of a successful career singing leading tenor roles in opera seria at Modena, Venice, Florence, Pisa and Rome. He created roles in operas by J. C. Bach, Giuseppe Sarti, Pietro Guglielmi, Antonio Sacchini, Ferdinando Bertoni and others. The arias they wrote for his voice tended to be moderate in tempo and often were written in B major. Many of the composers orchestrated his arias with obbligato clarinets and expressive chromatic inflections.

In Rome, Adamberger sang under the italianized stage name Valentino Adamonti from 1775 to 1777. From 1778-1779 he sang at the King&#x27;s Theatre in London. After returning to Italy briefly for appearances in Florence and Milan, he joined the &quot;Singspiel&quot; company of the National Court Theater at Vienna. He made his début there on 21 August 1780. The following year, he married the Viennese actress Maria Anna Adamberger (1753–1804); their daughter was Antonie Adamberger, later a popular actress. In 1783, the &quot;Singspiel&quot; company disbanded but Adamberger was kept on for the Italian company that replaced it. When the &quot;Singspiel&quot; company was revived in 1785, alongside the Italian, he again became its leading tenor, and when it was disbanded for the second time, in 1789, he returned to the Italian company. In 1793, he retired from the stage but continued as a member of the imperial &quot;Hofkapelle&quot; and as an eminent singing teacher. He died in Vienna.

Although Adamberger&#x27;s voice was admired where ever he went, he did have his critics. Christian Schubart and Mount Edgcumbe remarked on the nasal quality of his voice in the higher vocal register and Charles Burney, generally a harsh critic of singers, remarked that &quot;with a better voice [he] would have been a good singer&quot;. However, he was universally liked by the public in Italy, Germany, and England, and was a particularly popular singer in Vienna. Michtner, a local Viennese journalist, wrote of Adamberger that he was &quot;the favourite singer of softer hearts&quot;. Mozart, who admired Adamberger, wrote the part of Belmonte in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (1782) for him. In a letter dated 26 September 1781, Mozart wrote, &quot;Let me now turn to Belmonte&#x27;s aria in A major, ‘&quot;O wie ängstlich, o wie feurig&quot;’. Would you like to know how I have expressed it – and even indicated his throbbing heart? By the two violins playing in octaves. This is the favourite aria of all who have heard it, and it is mine also. I wrote it expressly to suit Adamberger&#x27;s voice. You see the trembling, the faltering, you see how his throbbing breast begins to swell; this I have expressed by a crescendo. You hear the whispering and the sighing – which I have indicated by the first violins with mutes and a flute playing in unison.&quot; Mozart also composed the role of Vogelsang in &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; (1786) for Adamberger, as well as several concert arias (K.420 and K.431) and the cantata &quot;Die Maurerfreude&quot; (K.471).

<text>The Selby rail crash (also known as the Great Heck Rail Crash) was a railway accident that occurred on 28 February 2001 near Great Heck, Selby, North Yorkshire when a passenger train collided with a car which had crashed down a motorway embankment onto the railway line. The passenger train then collided with an oncoming freight train. Ten people died, including the drivers of the two trains, and 82 were injured. It remains the worst rail disaster of the 21st century in the United Kingdom.

The driver of the car, Gary Hart, was convicted of ten counts of causing death by dangerous driving and sentenced to five years in prison after a jury found that he had fallen asleep while driving. As a result of the crash, Hart&#x27;s insurers paid out £50 million in claims.

The InterCity 225 passenger train was operating 1F23, the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) 04:45 service from Newcastle to London King&#x27;s Cross with 99 occupants onboard. It consisted of a leading Driving Van Trailer (DVT), nine Mark 4 coaches, and a trailing Class 91 locomotive. The InterCity 225 operates in a push-pull configuration; in normal operations, the DVT is the lead vehicle for southbound services such as this one, remotely controlling the pushing Class 91 locomotive at the rear.

The freight train was operating 6G34, the Freightliner 05:00 service from Immingham Docks to Eggborough power station. It consisted of a leading Class 66 locomotive, and sixteen fully laden coal wagons.

The car was a Land Rover Defender, which was towing a Renault Savanna. It was being driven by 36-year-old Gary Hart on a journey from his home in Strubby, Lincolnshire, which he left at 04:40, to his work in Wigan.

The accident occurred on a section of the East Coast Main Line. The line speed for this section is and passes under two road bridges, one carrying the M62 motorway over the rail line. In the southbound direction, there is a trailing set of points connecting a freight yard to the Up line.

==Events==
The accident sequence began at approximately 06:13, when the car left the westbound carriageway of the motorway just before the bridge over the rail line. The vehicle travelled down an embankment and onto the southbound railway track. After a failed attempt to reverse off the track, Hart exited the vehicle and called the emergency services using his mobile telephone. During the call, the Land Rover was hit by the InterCity 225. The sound of the train&#x27;s horn and the collision with the car was captured on Hart&#x27;s 999 call.

After striking the Land Rover, the leading bogie of the Driving Van Trailer derailed, but the train stayed upright. The set of trailing points from the freight yard then deflected it into the path of the oncoming freight train.

The freight train collided with the InterCity 225 approximately from the passenger train&#x27;s impact with the Land Rover, resulting in the near-total destruction of the DVT and moderate to severe damage to all nine of the InterCity 225&#x27;s coaches, which mostly overturned and came to rest down an embankment to the east side of the track, in a field adjacent to the railway line just south of the second overbridge. The trailing locomotive of the passenger train was derailed but remained upright and suffered only minor damage. The freight locomotive lost its bogies after impact, with debris from the DVT jammed underneath, rupturing its fuel tank. It overturned onto its left side, coming to rest in the garden of a residence adjacent to the line to the north of the bridge. The first nine wagons following it were derailed and damaged to varying extents. Two wagons that left the line with the freight locomotive flattened a caravan and garage on the grounds of the house all three came to rest in, but stopped short of striking the house itself.

Both train drivers, two additional train crew on board the InterCity 225, and six passengers were killed, all as a result of the collision with the freight train. Survivors of the crash included Andrew Hill, a train driver who was travelling in the cab of the freight train, supervising the experienced driver who was learning a new route.

==Investigation==
Her Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate was notified of the crash at 06:55, and four inspectors arrived at the scene at 09:24. Another four inspectors arrived shortly thereafter. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) released an interim report on 6 March 2001. It was conducted with the assistance of several entities, including GNER and Freightliner, the operators of the trains; Railtrack, the owner of the railway infrastructure; both South and North Yorkshire Police, the British Transport Police, and the Highways Agency. Investigators recovered the data recorder of the freight locomotive, but the InterCity 225 had not yet been fitted with one under GNER&#x27;s rolling programme of installation.

The HSE released their final report into the accident on 4 December 2002. It stated that no defects were found with any of the railway infrastructure that could have contributed to the outcome of the crash, and that the motorway complied with the standards at the time. A separate investigation into road standards was carried out by a working group set up by the Health and Safety Commission, which brought its own recommendations. These included carrying out risk assessments at specific locations and collecting data from incidents involving vehicles entering the railway. The working group stated that they expected a similar event to the Selby rail crash to occur every 300 to 400 years.

At the time of the impact with the car, the InterCity 225 was estimated to have been travelling at a speed of to . After the initial collision, the train then slowed to an estimated speed of prior to the impact with the freight train, which was estimated to have been travelling at . With an estimated closing speed of , the collision between the trains is the highest-speed railway incident that has occurred in the UK.

The report considered the crashworthiness of the trains. The InterCity 225 had 99 occupants at the time, out of a total seating capacity of 544. The DVT suffered major damage, which included the cab being separated from the underframe. This was due to it being more lightweight, and having a lower ride height than the freight locomotive it collided with. 45 of the 52 seriously injured passengers, and all eight fatalities, were travelling in the first five coaches. These coaches were noted for having the most damage, with their survival space reduced due to several impacts. Overall, the report noted that the coaches performed well in the crash, considering the high speeds involved.

The front and right side of the freight locomotive suffered heavy damage as a result of the impact with the DVT. Though the locomotive&#x27;s body had a robust construction, which meant it only suffered relatively minor structural damage compared to the other vehicles involved in the accident, its design meant that it did not have any energy absorbing features. The report added &quot;Its design does not appear to complement the crashworthy considerations that guide the construction of passenger vehicles that use the same rail network.&quot; Some freight wagons impacted the passenger train&#x27;s coaches, causing extensive damage. This was partially due to the angular design of the wagons, which was also noted in the Southall rail crash investigation.

The report recommended that further research be conducted on how derailments occur and how the vehicles behave during them. This research should consider several factors, such as vehicle construction and safety features such as obstacle deflectors and bogie retention. It raised concerns relating to the design of freight trains as a whole, and mentioned that future designs should include features such as energy absorption functionality and bogie retention. It also stated that freight vehicles should avoid aggressive corners at possible interfaces with passenger trains in the event of a crash. Tripwires similar to those already used close to airport runways were mentioned as potentially warranting further research. These could detect the incursion of a road vehicle onto railway property, and interface with different train control systems. Although this may not help when a train is already close to the incident, it could provide an early warning to the incursion in other cases.

==Aftermath==
Hart was tried at Leeds Crown Court on ten counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecution alleged that Hart had fallen asleep while driving, after having spent five hours the previous night on the phone to a woman he had met through an advert on an internet dating agency. He had been on the phone call from 21:48 to 02:58, and sent text messages between 03:11 and 03:57. He did not get any sleep before leaving his house and starting his journey 90 minutes after the end of the phone call. As part of their investigation, the police tried to replicate the drive, which was in 70 minutes. With a police escort, and after going like a &quot;bat out of hell&quot;, they completed the journey with two minutes to spare.

Hart denied the allegations, saying that he did not fall asleep, and he would have pulled over if he were tired. He said that he could go 36 hours without sleep, and that he heard a loud bang before the car left the road, and thought it could have been a puncture. When asked why he initially told the police on the day of the crash that he had slept for two-and-a-half to three hours, Hart said that he was in shock. He said that he hadn&#x27;t got any sleep as he was &quot;buzzing with excitement&quot; ahead of planning to meet the woman later that day.

Hart was found guilty on 13 December 2001. On 11 January 2002, he was sentenced to five years in prison and given a five-year driving ban after the jury found that he had fallen asleep while driving. He was released from prison in July 2004 after serving half of his sentence, which is normal practice in the United Kingdom for this kind of sentence.

An inquest into the deaths of the ten victims opened on 8 September 2003 in Harrogate. On 12 September 2003, the jury decided that all ten people who died in the accident were unlawfully killed.

In total, Hart&#x27;s insurers, Fortis, who provided him with an unlimited liability third-party fire and theft policy, paid out £50 million as a result of the crash. In October 2003, Fortis was a party in a legal case in the High Court, to try to recover some of the funds it had paid out. They alleged that the safety barrier was too short, and in a statement said that if it had been longer, the crash would never have happened. On 30 October 2003, the judge ruled that negligence on behalf of the Highways Agency had not been established, and that Hart was the precipitating cause of the accident. Fortis held a reinsurance policy, so only had to pay the first £1.5 million themselves, with the remainder being paid by Munich Re, up to the threshold of their reinsurance policy held with another provider.

==Memorials==

A Class 66 locomotive, 66526 was named &quot;Driver Steve Dunn (George)&quot; by Freightliner in memory of the freight train driver killed in the collision. It carries a plaque commemorating the disaster: &quot;In remembrance of a dedicated engineman Driver Steve (George) Dunn was tragically killed in the accident at Great Heck on 28thFebruary 2001&quot;. Dunn&#x27;s son James, who was nine at the time of the crash, later became a train driver. Barry Needham, another Freightliner employee killed in the crash, was also commemorated by the naming of locomotive 56115 after him. The nameplates and plaques were transferred to locomotive 60087 and later to 60091. These locomotives also carried an explanatory plaque.

GNER honoured the passenger train driver, John Weddle, by naming a new driver-training school in his home city of Newcastle after him. In a ceremony attended by members of his family, his 16-year-old daughter Stephanie unveiled a plaque dedicating the school to his memory.

Seventeen books of condolences were created and put out at GNER stations for the public to sign. These were damaged by a flood while in storage, but were later restored and put into a collection by the National Railway Museum. A stone memorial garden was created close to the crash site, with a plaque which was unveiled by the first person on scene after the accident.

<text>Joseph Havelock Wilson (16 August 1859 – 16 April 1929), commonly known as Havelock Wilson or J. Havelock Wilson, was a British trade union leader, Liberal Party politician, and campaigner for the rights of merchant seamen.

==Early life==
He was born in Sunderland and went to sea as a boy, serving somewhere between 10 and 14 years at sea. In 1879 whilst still a seaman he married Jane Ann Watham at Sunderland. In 1882 he opened a &quot;Temperance Hotel&quot; in Sunderland settling down to life ashore at the age of 24. 

==Political and trade union activities==
He became involved in a local seamen&#x27;s union established in Sunderland in 1879 and had become its president by 1885. Wilson pursued a policy of attempting to build branches in nearby ports, which met with some success but led to disagreements within the leadership. In 1887, Wilson broke with the Sunderland union to establish his own National Sailors&#x27; &amp; Firemen&#x27;s Union, which was committed to a policy of expansion. Wilson remained president of the union until his death.

Wilson rose to prominence in the late 1880s, on the back of the success of his union and his involvement in various strikes, including the London dock strike of 1889.

Wilson&#x27;s first electoral contest was at a by-election in Bristol East in 1890, at which he did poorly. He won his second contest, at Middlesbrough in 1892, in which he stood as an independent labour candidate in opposition to a Gladstonian Liberal, and a Liberal Unionist. 
Having secured election, however, Like John Burns, Wilson moved quickly to cooperate with the Liberal Party. He also allied with existing Lib–Lab Members of Parliament (MPs) such as Thomas Burt and John Wilson. Wilson continued to align himself with the Liberal Party in politics despite the establishment and growth of the Independent Labour Party. Indeed, he was fiercely critical of the party and of key figures within it such as Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald.

In 1893, Wilson brought an unsuccessful action for libel against &quot;The Evening News and Post&quot;, seeking thousands in damages. The newspaper was represented by the Irish Unionist Edward Carson. In late July 1893, a jury at Guildford found against Wilson, and the judge, Sir William Grantham, a former Conservative member of parliament, ordered him to pay the newspaper’s costs.

Wilson&#x27;s union suffered in the early 1890s and almost collapsed in 1894.

Wilson retained his Middlesbrough seat in the 1895 general election but narrowly lost to Samuel Alexander Sadler, a Conservative, in the 1900 election – an election characterised by a considerable swing towards the Conservatives. He won Middlesbrough for a third and final time at the 1906 election. 


He did not stand for Parliament in 1910.
Wilson&#x27;s union revived in 1911, with the outbreak of a wave of seamen&#x27;s and dockers&#x27; strikes in British ports. Despite his militant tactics, Wilson was a relative moderate whose goal was to establish friendly relations with shipowners and formal conciliation procedures in the shipping industry to enable disputes to be resolved without recourse to strikes or lockouts. This goal was steadily achieved after shipowners recognised the union in 1911 and began working closely with officials during the First World War. After 1917, wage rates and conditions were set by the National Maritime Board, which represented the Shipping Federation and Wilson&#x27;s union.

Wilson and his union were noted as one of the most vociferous supporters of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the First World War, because of the loss of merchant seamen to U-Boats. This was in contrast to the position of the miners, engineers and railwaymen, who became increasingly sceptical of Britain&#x27;s war effort by the latter stages of the war.

He was a founder of the National Democratic Party but stood as a Liberal at the October 1918 by-election in South Shields, when he was elected unopposed. He held the seat as a Coalition Liberal at the 1918 general election. 
His last electoral contest came at the 1922 general election, when he stood as a National Liberal candidate, but lost his seat – coming third with only 20.5% of the vote.

In the 1920s, Wilson&#x27;s reputation as a &#x27;bosses&#x27; man&#x27; made him increasingly unpopular in the wider labour movement. His union was seen as having become little more than a “company union”.

Havelock Wilson was buried in Hendon Park Cemetery, with many dockers in attendance having walked to the graveside from Docklands.

<text>The Central Reorganisation Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) was a communist group in India 1979–1991. The Secretary of the All-India Leading Committee of the CRC, CPI(ML) was K. Venu. The main organ of CRC, CPI(ML) was called &quot;Mass Line&quot;. CRC, CPI(ML) also published &quot;Liberation&quot; and &quot;Comrade&quot;.

CRC, CPI(ML) emerged from the pro-Charu Majumdar tendency of the Naxalite movement. It had its main roots in the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)). But the KSC differed from the original CPI(ML) by advocating a mass line.

In 1982 the First All India Conference of CRC, CPI(ML) was held. The second conference was held in 1987.

In 1984 CRC, CPI(ML) was one of the three founders of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (the others being Revolutionary Communist Party (USA) and Communist Party of Peru).

In 1987 CRC, CPI(ML) suffered a heavy setback when a major portion of the organisation broke away and formed CPI (ML) Red Flag.

In October 1991 CRC, CPI(ML) was dissolved. K. Venu renounced Maoism and declared an All India communist party as an impossibility. Groups dissatisfied with the dissolution formed the Maharashtra Communist Party and Kerala Communist Party. MCP and KCP later merged to form the Maoist Unity Centre, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). MUC, CPI(ML) later merged with CPI(ML) Naxalbari.

K. Venu later joined the Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy. He contested the 1996 Kerala assembly elections from Kondugallur. Venu came second with 37,234 votes.

<text>Chatham Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Chatham, Kent. It currently plays in the Isthmian Premier Division and is nicknamed The Chats.

Former Premier League club Portsmouth and current Premier League club West Ham United played their first competitive matches against Chatham.

==History==
The club was formed in 1882 as Chatham United, when Rochester Invicta merged with the Royal Engineers Band football team. Chatham played their home games at the Army owned pitches called &quot;The Lines&quot;, where they were to remain until 1889 when they moved to the Maidstone Road Ground. The move to the new ground was prompted when the club reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1888–89, and admission fees could not be charged at &quot;The Lines&quot; because of Army regulations. This cup run was also instrumental in the Football Association&#x27;s ruling that all future matches in the competition must be played on fully enclosed grounds, where the visiting club would receive a share of the gate money. So the club moved to the Maidstone Road site which was owned by a George Winch, who allowed the club to enclose the ground and build a pavilion with seats in front for £125.

In 1894 Chatham became founder members of both the Southern League and the original Kent League, winning the Kent League in its inaugural season. For the first two seasons the club competed in both leagues, but left the Kent League to concentrate on the Southern League in 1896. In the 1900–01 season, owing to financial difficulties, Chatham resigned from the Southern League. They played as Chatham Amateurs in 1901 for a season and rejoined the Kent League, where two seasons later in 1903/04, they won the Kent league and repeated the same feat the following season, as well as winning the Kent Senior Cup.

After World War I, Chatham returned to play and in the 1919 season won the Kent Victory Cup and the Chatham Charity Cup. They rejoined the Southern League in 1920–21, but withdrew at the end of the season because of the burden of travel costs on club finances. In 1927–28 they rejoined the Southern League for two seasons. Again, the expenses to play proved a financial strain on the club, and returned to the Kent League. The club struggled financially and for the 1933–34 season the club took a voluntary relegation into Division Two of the Kent League. A season later they won the division but decided against promotion, and reverted to Amateur status. Having played in both the Kent League and Kent Amateur League in 1938–39, they decided to limit play to amateur competition the following season, however this was interrupted by World War II.

After the War Chatham won the Kent Amateur League Premier Division in 1946–47, which was to be their last honour under that name. On 7 January 1947 they merged with Shorts F.C., with the amalgamated club taking the name Chatham Town at the request of the local council. They then joined Division One of the Kent League for the 1947–48 season and stayed there until 1959, when the Kent league disbanded. For the 1959–60 season they joined as a founding member of the Aetolian League. The following year they captured the League Championship and the Aetolian League Cup Final. In 1964–65 the Aetolian League merged with the London League to form the Greater London League, and the club moved to the Metropolitan League. Four Seasons later they returned to the Kent League when it was reformed in 1968.

They remained in the Kent League until 1983, when they joined the Southern League. During the 15-year period in the Kent league they won the league 4 times and won the league and cup double in both the 1971–72 and 1977–78 seasons. The club changed its name in 1974 for 5 years to Medway F.C., at the request of the local council, returning to Chatham Town in 1979.

The club stayed in the Southern League until 1988, when having failed to gain re-election they were relegated to the Kent League; there were financial troubles. They experienced crowds, as had other poorly supported clubs, in double figures; Kent League days had healthier attendance with more local competition. Upon returning to the Kent League, the club struggled, until former player John Adams became First Team manager. He guided the club to the Third Qualifying Round of the F.A. Cup in 1993–94, the Final of the Kent Senior Trophy in 1995–96 and finished among the top three of the Kent League for three successive seasons. However he was dismissed by the club following a bad start to the 1996–97 season.

In 1997 the club was forced to briefly return to Great Lines when a new drainage system saw parts of the Maidstone Road pitch collapse. The Kent League allowed them to use the Garrison Ground in Kings Bastian for several matches, before they could arrange a brief ground-share with Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium. The club returned home for the 1998–99 season under new manager Carl Laraman, with results improving immediately; however he left in January of that year to take up a coaching position at Charlton Athletic. His assistant, Steve Hearn, was appointed player-manager and saw the club become Kent League Champions and promoted to the Southern League, in 2000–01. At the end of the first season in the league Steve Hearn resigned due to poor results and was replaced by his assistant Peter Coupland. However Peter Coupland only lasted until the middle of the 2003–04 season (with the club looking likely to be relegated) with Clive Walker replacing him, and steering the club to a mid table finish.

The league was restructured for the 2004–05 season and saw Chatham being placed in the Southern League Eastern Division. During this campaign Clive Walker return to his old club Dover Athletic and his assistant Steve Binks was appointed manager. Since that season the club has moved between the Isthmian League North and South Divisions with regular mid table positions. For the 2006–07 season the club saw former player Phil Miles take over as Manager; however this lasted until December that season when he had to stand down due to work commitments with Steve Binks taking over the job again. During this season the club achieved the FA Charter Standard award. Between the seasons 2006–07 and 2007–08 the club played in Isthmian League Division 1 South. The club played in Isthmian League Division 1 North in the season 2008–09, but transferred the following season to Division 1 South.

The Season 2010–11 saw a management change with Paul Foley and his assistant Mark Newson move from VCD Athletic. In this season, the club played in Isthmian League Division 1 South finishing 21st, a relegation place. However, the club was reprieved from relegation and instead were transferred for the next season to Isthmian League Division 1 North. The management team of Foley and Newson lasted until the end of that season when Player Manager Kevin Watson took over at first in a caretaker role and then as Manager for the 2011–12 season.

Between the seasons 2011–12 and 2014–15, the club played without notable success in Isthmian League Division 1 North. From the start of season 2015–16, the club has played in Isthmian League Division 1 South. The club were relegated at the end of the 2016–17 season.

On 9 April 2022, following a 10–1 defeat of Erith &amp; Belvedere, Chatham secured promotion back to the Isthmian League. Despite finishing on 100 points and scoring 122 goals, Chatham finished the season in second place behind Sheppey United. The following season, the club achieved back-to-back promotions when they were crowned Champions of the Isthmian League South East Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;22/23 Champions&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Chasing a third consecutive promotion, Chatham finished second to Hornchurch, winning the Velocity Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;23/24 Velocity Cup&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest and colours==
The club&#x27;s current crest, features mostly red with a ship, was launched in 2019. The club stated that it &quot;embraced our rich naval heritage which stems back to our forming in 1882&quot;.

Chatham typically play in a red home shirt with black detailing.

==Ground==
Chatham Town play their home games at The Bauvill Stadium, Maidstone Road, Chatham, Kent, ME4 6LR.

<doc id="1145459" wikidata="Q5002322" url="?curid=1145459" title="But Seriously, Folks...">
<text>But Seriously, Folks... is the fourth studio album by the American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. The album was released in mid-1978, on the Asylum label. It included the satirical song &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot;. The original 8:04 (8:57 on CD releases with a speech at the end) album version of this track was edited down to 4:35 for single release, and this became Walsh&#x27;s biggest solo hit, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;.

The album also featured the other four members of Eagles – which Walsh had joined two years earlier – as well as singer-keyboardist Jay Ferguson, a former member of the groups Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne (who co-wrote one track on the album), drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh&#x27;s former band Barnstorm, and bassist Willie Weeks.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that, although Walsh has &quot;a gift for tuneful guitar schlock&quot;, most of the album&#x27;s songs fall &quot;far short of the irreverent shuck-and-jive&quot; of &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Al Campbell said that the album is &quot;Joe Walsh&#x27;s most insightful and melodic&quot;, and &quot;captures a reflective song cycle along the same thematic lines of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, only for the &#x27;70s&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the single &quot;Over and Over&quot; &quot;has several distinctive rhythmic breaks, organ backing, swirling guitar work, slip and slide beat and good double-tracked vocals&quot; and praised Walsh&#x27;s slide guitar solo.

<doc id="1145461" wikidata="Q757365" url="?curid=1145461" title="Isha (prayer)">
<text>Isha (), alternatively also transliterated as Isha&#x27;a, and also known as Khoftan or Khooftaan, is one of the mandatory five daily Islamic prayers, and contains four cycles.

==Ahadith mentioning virtues==
Uthman reported that he heard Muhammad saying: &quot;The one who offered Isha salat in a congregation, it was as if he remained in salat up to midnight, and he who offered the Fajr salat in a congregation, it was as if he remained in salat the whole night.&quot; (Muslim)

Abu Hurairah reported: The Messenger of Allah said, &quot;The most difficult Salah for the &quot;Munafiqeen&quot; (the hypocrites) is Isha and Fajr. Had they known the rewards for them, they would have attended them even if they had to crawl on their knees.&quot; (Bukhari)

==Sunni Muslims==
The time period within which the Isha prayer must be recited is the following:

*Time begins: According to the Hanafi school, Isha begins when complete darkness has arrived and the white twilight in the sky has disappeared. According to the Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools, the time begins when the red thread has disappeared from the sky. These times can be approximated by using the sun as a measure. When the sun has descended 12 degrees below the horizon, it is approximately equivalent to the disappearance of the red from the sky. Islamic rationalist are of the opinion that the time of Isha prayer starts after civil dusk, when darkness starts spreading across the sky. For approximating when complete darkness begins, some astronomers argue that it occurs when the sun has descended 15 degrees below the horizon while others use the safer measure of 18 degrees.
*Time ends: At the beginning of dawn when the time for Fajr prayer begins. However, it is frowned upon to delay the prayer without a legitimate reason past the first third of the night, and &quot;night&quot; in Islamic law means the time between the end of the Maghrib prayer and the start of the Fajr prayer. Islamic rationalist are of the opinion that the time of Isha prayer ends at nautical dusk, when the darkness spreads completely and the western horizon can no longer be observed through the naked eye. According to an opinion in the Maliki school, the prohibition is from delaying the prayer beyond the first half of the night, rather than just the first third.

==Shia Muslims==
The time period within which the Isha prayer must be recited is the following:

For Shia Muslims:

*Time begins: once Maghrib (evening prayer) has been recited and completed.
*Time ends: at midnight, the midpoint between shafak and dawn.

However, it is very important to recite the prayer as soon as the time begins. Often Maghrib and Isha are offered together with a small gap of time in between.

*Wudu (Washing of some body parts to prepare oneself for praying)
*Other salah:

**Zuhr prayer (Mid-day)
**Asr prayer (Afternoon)

<text>Jules Guérin (November 18, 1866 – June 14, 1946) was an American muralist, architectural delineator, and illustrator. A painter and widely published magazine illustrator, he gained prominence for his architectural work such as in the 1906, &quot;Plan for Chicago&quot;, and for the large murals he painted in many well-known public structures such as the Lincoln Memorial.

==Biography==
Jules Vallée Guérin was born in St Louis, Missouri on November 18, 1866 and his family moved to Chicago in 1880. As a teenager, he was employed as a painter in a Chicago theatrical scenery firm. By 1889 he is known to have shared a studio with Winsor McCay, the noted cartoonist. They influenced each other in their use of daring points of view. In 1893 Guerin made a painting of one of the buildings at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. His only confirmed art instruction occurred in Chicago, Jules attended evening life drawing classes for two years from 1892 to 1894 at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago, In 1896 he left Chicago to study in Paris. Though of French Huguenot descent, he is not likely to have spoken French fluently as a child. Nothing in his style or method indicates a Beaux Arts education.

In 1900 he established a studio in New York, where he made his name as an architectural delineator and illustrator. His first major break occurred when he was hired by Charles Follen McKim to create some illustrations for the Senate Parks Commission (McMillan Plan) for Washington. These were exhibited and published in 1902. Architects began hiring Guérin to make similar, dramatic renderings of their buildings. He worked mainly in watercolor, gouache, and tempera, usually on colored board. His fame as a colorist soon spread, and he took on more work as a magazine illustrator and sold lithographs. Guérin was a frequent contributor to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Century Magazine&quot; during the first decade of the Twentieth Century.

As a result of his success in Washington, Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett hired Guérin to make perspective illustrations for their monumental work, &quot;The Plan of Chicago&quot; in 1907. The spectacular color views of the proposed city, many from a bird&#x27;s eye perspective, are his most famous works. The majority of these original renderings—by Guérin and other artists—are in the collection of the Department of Architecture at The Art Institute of Chicago, while others are currently owned by the Chicago Historical Society.

In 1912, when the architect Henry Bacon was competing with John Russell Pope to win the commission for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., he hired Guérin to create renderings of alternative designs. The paintings, still in the National Archives, were likely influential in Bacon&#x27;s triumph. After he received the commission, Bacon retained Guerin to paint two large murals, &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Emancipation&quot;, that decorate the cella of the memorial above the Gettysburg and Second Inaugural Addresses. They were recently cleaned, revealing a subtle color palette that complements Daniel Chester French’s Seated Lincoln statue. In 1916 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1931.

As an adjunct to his work as an illustrator, Guérin took an active part in the international expositions of his day, showing at the Pan American Expo in Buffalo, New York, 1901, the Louisiana Purchase Expo held in St Louis in 1904 at which he won a silver medal, and the Lewis &amp; Clark Expo in Portland, Oregon in 1905. He published illustrations of these fairs in popular magazines of the day. In 1915, Guérin was asked by Edward Bennett to serve as Director of Color at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Unlike previous fairs, this west coast effort used a palette of Mediterranean colors to accent the buildings to take advantage of the local climate and flora. It is likely that connections that he made there led to his one-man show at the University of California, Berkeley two years later, followed by several large murals in the old Federal Reserve Bank Building of San Francisco.

Probably because of his early Chicago based background, Guérin was a frequent collaborator with the Chicago architectural firm (and the successor firm to Daniel Burnham’s practice) Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White. Most notable of these commissions was the dramatic fire curtain for the theatre in GAPW&#x27;s Chicago Civic Opera Building in 1929.

Guérin&#x27;s work as a book illustrator came as a result of magazine commissions. Articles in &quot;The Century&quot; by Maria Hornor Lansdale resulted in her 1906 travel book, &quot;The Chateaux of Touraine&quot;, which supplements its many photographs with Guérin&#x27;s paintings. From 1909 to 1911 the painter traveled with Robert Hichens to create similar illustrations for his popular books on Egypt, the Holy Land, and the Near East. The superb color lithography in these books, as well as two he published with Maxfield Parrish, has made them highly collectible today.

Despite his wish to be regarded as a major serious artist, Jules Guérin is most highly regarded as an illustrator and architectural delineator. Indeed, he stands tall among a distinguished group of American artists who brought to life the scenes and buildings of the Progressive Era in the emerging print media of the early Twentieth Century.

<doc id="1145482" wikidata="Q11690969" url="?curid=1145482" title="Mariana Pineda (play)">
<text>Mariana Pineda is a play by the Spanish playwright and poet Federico García Lorca. It is based on the life of Mariana de Pineda Muñoz, whose opposition to Ferdinand VII (and subsequent public execution in 1831 for treason) had become part of the folklore of Granada. The play was written between 1923 and 1925 and was first performed in June 1927 at the Teatre Goya, in Barcelona. That production was directed by García Lorca, with scenic design and costumes by Salvador Dalí, and was performed by the company of Margarida Xirgu. The play received its Madrid première that October, at the Teatro Fontalba.

In contrast to García Lorca&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Evil Spell&quot;, which was first performed in 1920 but which closed after only four performances, &quot;Mariana Pineda&quot; was a success. Consequently, García Lorca often claimed that &quot;Mariana Pineda&quot; was his first play.

The play figures prominently in the opera &quot;Ainadamar&quot; (2003) by Osvaldo Golijov.

==Honors==
The Spanish airline, Iberia, has named one of its airplanes after the play and the person it was based on.

<doc id="1145489" wikidata="Q7782722" url="?curid=1145489" title="There Goes the Neighborhood (album)">
<text>There Goes the Neighborhood is the fifth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and sometime-guitarist for the Eagles, Joe Walsh. The album was released in May 1981, by Asylum Records, three years after Walsh&#x27;s album &quot;But Seriously, Folks...&quot; (1978).

The album features contributions from two Eagles&#x27; members Don Felder and Timothy B. Schmit as well as session musicians including Russ Kunkel, David Lindley, Bob Mayo, and Victor Feldman.

The album peaked at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album only spawned one charting single, &quot;A Life of Illusion&quot;, which would become one of Walsh&#x27;s most popular songs and reached No. 34 at on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single also topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

==Cover artwork==
The cover art for the album features Walsh leaning, while at the top of an American tank with rubble around him. Additionally, the single release of the song &quot;A Life of Illusion&quot; used the same image of Walsh. The promotional video for the track shows the coming to life of the album&#x27;s cover. In the cover photograph, office complex Century City, in Los Angeles, is in the background.

==Background==
&quot;A Life of Illusion&quot; was recorded in 1973 with Joe Walsh&#x27;s first solo band Barnstorm but was not completed. The overdubs and final mixes were completed during the &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; sessions and released on the album. This song also appeared in the opening credits of &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; (2005) and appears as the first song on its soundtrack.

Another track &quot;Rivers (Of the Hidden Funk)&quot; was a track Walsh wrote for the Eagles&#x27; sixth studio album &quot;The Long Run&quot; (1979), but was left off. The track featured a guest appearance by Walsh&#x27;s Eagles-mate Don Felder (who co-wrote the track) on talk box guitar.

The album&#x27;s final track &quot;You Never Know&quot; is a song about rumors and hearsay, including not-so-veiled swipes at other members of the Eagles and their management with lines like &quot;The Frontline grapevine jury&#x27;s in a nasty mood / you might be guilty, honey, you never know.&quot; (Frontline Management was Irving Azoff&#x27;s management firm at the time). Don Felder appears on guitar on this track performing rhythm and dual lead guitar solos with Walsh.

Eagles bandmate Timothy B. Schmit sang backing vocals on the opening track &quot;Things&quot;.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Ben Davies wrote: &quot;Joe Walsh&#x27;s long and varied career has had its ups and downs, to say the least. Here, you see Walsh in good old rock form... The rock legend&#x27;s trademark sound is prominently featured throughout the album, and undoubtedly here he performs some of his finest solos. The only qualm that one can pick is that the whole album is in a much-similar vein.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called the single &quot;Made Your Mind Up&quot; a &quot;real toe-tapper [that] features a compelling arrangement.&quot;

<doc id="1145492" wikidata="Q732653" url="?curid=1145492" title="Barney Greenway">
<text>Mark Andrew &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway (born 13 July 1969) is a British extreme metal vocalist who is the current lead singer and primary lyricist of Napalm Death and a former member of Extreme Noise Terror and Benediction.

Greenway has stated his nickname &quot;Barney&quot; came from a time when he used to drink alcohol. He stated he would get so drunk that when he went anywhere, he would bump into everything. From this behaviour, his friend Stick (drummer of Doom) would call him &quot;Rubble&quot;, which changed to &quot;Barney Rubble&quot; and then just &quot;Barney&quot;.

According to Graham Hartmann of Loudwire, &quot;Greenway’s primordial swamp-thing barking is one of extreme metal’s most distinct and imposing voices.&quot;

== Career ==

Greenway was initially the vocalist of death metal band Benediction from 1989 until he joined Napalm Death the following year, replacing the band&#x27;s previous vocalist Lee Dorrian, who later founded doom metal band Cathedral. Prior to joining Napalm Death, Greenway had worked as an engineer within the motor industry in Birmingham.

Greenway&#x27;s first album with Napalm Death, &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;, represented a shift in the band&#x27;s musical style, incorporating a more death metal-oriented sound. The albums that followed this, including &quot;Utopia Banished&quot;, &quot;Fear, Emptiness, Despair&quot; and &quot;Diatribes&quot;, saw the band delve further into the aforementioned style whilst also incorporating elements of groove metal.

Greenway and Napalm Death parted ways in 1996, with bassist Shane Embury referring to the long unrest that had been present between Greenway and the remainder of the band. Greenway later joined Extreme Noise Terror to record vocals on their album &quot;Damage 381&quot;, with Extreme Noise Terror&#x27;s vocalist Phil Vane joining Napalm Death to record vocals on their album &quot;Inside the Torn Apart&quot;. Vane and Napalm Death, however, were incompatible according to Embury, and after discussions between Greenway and the band, Greenway returned to record the vocals for the above album.

Greenway has remained with Napalm Death since 1997, have since released a number of critically acclaimed albums, and became as the band&#x27;s longest-serving lead vocalist.

== Artistry ==
Greenway&#x27;s performance style has been likened to &quot;watching someone throw a temper tantrum in a phone booth.&quot; According to Graham Hartmann of Loudwire, &quot;the Napalm Death frontman’s erratic, ghost-fighting behavior onstage is the uncorking of fist-clenching energy and disgust for broken political systems and societal disgust.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Greenway is a progressive metal fan. He joined Dream Theater on stage at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club and performed vocals on Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; live. He has reviewed progressive metal bands and albums for the British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; though he no longer does so. He has also stated his admiration for bands such as Motörhead and Throbbing Gristle, stating that the former&#x27;s album, &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, is his all-time favourite album. Greenway is also a voracious reader.

Greenway is a supporter of Aston Villa F.C. He is a supporter of many animal rights organisations including PETA; he has been a vegetarian since he was 14, and vegan since 2012. Greenway is recognisable for his strong Birmingham accent and for his distinctive gruff vocal style which many feel has become synonymous with Napalm Death. Greenway is an atheist.

<text>The Norwegian School of Economics () or NHH is a business school situated in Bergen, Norway. It was founded in 1936 as Norway&#x27;s first business school and is the leading teaching and research institution in Norway for the fields of management and business administration.

Admission to NHH is the most selective in the field of business administration in Norway and among the most selective of all study programs offered in Norway. The sole NHH undergraduate program consistently ranks among the most popular first choice for students applying for undergraduate study in Norway. In 2020, NHH was the most popular first choice of all undergraduate programs in Norway, with more than 2,100 first choice applications, and more than 5,000 in total, for 500 places.

The school participates in exchange programs with more than 170 foreign business schools and universities in over 50 countries, and around 40 percent of the school&#x27;s students spend at least one semester on exchange. The school is a member of CEMS (The Global Alliance in Management Education) and the Partnership in International Management (PIM) network. It is accredited by EQUIS, AMBA and AACSB.

==History==

Traditionally, economics was only taught at Norwegian universities, mainly at the University of Oslo, where it was first conceived, in the 19th-century as a sub-discipline of law. Business administration was not regarded as an academic discipline, and no formal education program was available. NHH was founded to provide the first formal training in business studies with a two-year vocational degree, called &quot;handelskandidat&quot; (&quot;candidate of commerce&quot;). In 1963 the &quot;handelskandidat&quot; degree was renamed &quot;siviløkonom&quot; and it later evolved into a four-year degree. The school today offers degrees at the master&#x27;s and doctoral levels.

===1900–1936: Establishing a business school in Norway===

At the end of the 19th-century, Oslo and Bergen business communities began discussing the need for a Norwegian business school. A number of schools had been opened across Europe, and during the early 20th-century several business schools were established in Scandinavia based on the German &quot;handelshochschule&quot; (business school) model. Among them was the Stockholm School of Economics which was founded in 1909. In 1917, Norway&#x27;s parliament, the Storting, passed a resolution to establish a Norwegian business school.

===1936–1963: NHH opens and sets to work===

After much lobbying and hard work, especially by Kristoffer Lehmkuhl, NHH was finally opened by King Haakon VII on Monday 7 September 1936, ten years before the University of Bergen was established. The strong involvement of the business community in Bergen had ensured not only that the school was established, but that it was based in Bergen. It closely linked to business community from the outset.

When NHH first opened, there were less than ten academic staff with 60 students enrolling each year. The first degree course offered was the &quot;Handelsdiplom&quot; (business diploma) and graduates received the title &quot;Handelskandidat&quot; (business graduate). This was initially a two-year course and, starting in 1938, a one-year additional course was offered to candidates who wanted to become teachers. In 1946 the &quot;Handelsdiplom&quot; course was extended to three years.

After the World War II, American influence became more important and also started to influence NHH to a greater extent. Graduates and staff began to go to the US to continue their studies and work for a period, a trend that greatly increased in the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1950s the need for a doctoral programme at NHH had grown. In 1956, NHH received permission from the Norwegian government to award doctorates and in 1957 the first doctoral candidate graduated from NHH.

===1963–1980: A new campus and rapid growth===

By the late 1950s NHH had outgrown its original premises and work began on developing a new campus for the school at Sandviken, just outside Bergen city centre. In 1963, the school moved to its new campus, an event which in many ways marked the transition to a new period characterised by a rapid increase in the number of students as well as teachers. The new campus provided a large increase in capacity and the annual intake of students increased from 60 to over 200.

An important feature of this period was the growth and development of the faculty. The new facilities made it possible to employ many new, talented people and the importance of research as well as teaching was strengthened. Many successful graduates went to the US to study for doctorates and came back to NHH with international experience and a more research based focus. Many faculty members took advantage of sabbaticals to study and continue their research overseas, many textbooks were published and the volume of publications in international journals increased significantly. A driving force behind this expansion and internationalisation of research was Professor Karl Borch.

During this time Professor Jan Mossin&#x27;s seminal paper &quot;Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market&quot; was published in Econometrica, contributing significantly to the development of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). About the same time as Mossin returned to NHH from Carnegie Mellon with his doctorate, future Nobel laureate Finn E. Kydland went to the same university for his doctoral studies. Most of the US educated doctoral graduates came back to NHH to teach and continue their research, but some stayed in the US and a few (like Kydland) returned to NHH only to later go back to the US to continue their work.

As the faculty grew and developed so did the academic offerings, with several advanced level courses established. In 1963 the name of the Handelsdiplom degree was changed to &quot;siviløkonom&quot;, with graduate receiving the same title. A master level programme, &quot;høyere avdelingstudium&quot; (HAS), was introduced in 1972 as a preparation for &quot;siviløkonom&quot; students wishing to continue on to doctoral studies; and in 1973 Professor Dag Coward established a master level programme for students wishing to specialise in auditing, accounting and the financial management of firms, the &quot;høyere revisorstudium&quot; (HRS). In 1975 the &quot;siviløkonom&quot; degree course was extended to a four-year programme.

===1980–2000: Specialisation and international expansion===

In the early 1980s it was realised that the doctoral programme required updating and a new, structured PhD programme was introduced involving taught courses in addition to the research and writing of a thesis. This new PhD programme continued the focus on research at NHH, rather than just teaching. The first candidate to graduate from the new PhD programme did so in 1985 and the annual number of graduates rose from 1 in 1985 to 12 in 1990.

The focus on expansion and internationalisation of research was recognised in 1984 as NHH was ranked 7th globally and 3rd in Europe in the American Economic Review amongst economics schools or departments in non-English speaking countries by publications in leading journals.

During this period, close relations with international research environments were also established. The international activities at the school have increased considerably and the international focus has become stronger over the years. In 1984 NHH established their first international exchange agreement with the Stockholm School of Economics, and in 1986 NHH became the first institution in Norway to offer a master&#x27;s degree programme taught entirely in English - the Master of International Business (MIB). Following this, greater emphasis has been placed on exchange arrangements for students, and the school joined the prestigious Community of European Management Schools (CEMS) and the Erasmus programme in 1992 and the global Partnership in International Management (PIM) network in 1995.

Student and staff numbers continued to rise throughout the 1980s and 1990s. By 1985 there were 1670 students and 198 members of staff in total.

===2000–present: Continued growth and development into the 21st century===
The &quot;siviløkonom&quot; qualification was extended to 5 years in 2003. In line with the Bologna declaration, it now comprises a 3-year Bachelor of Science in Economics and Business Administration combined with a 2-year Master of Science in Economics and Business Administration.

NHH alumnus and Adjunct Professor Finn E. Kydland was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2004, together with Professor Edward C. Prescott of Arizona State University. Kydland was giving a lecture at NHH when news of the award arrived. Prescott was a Visiting Professor of Economics at NHH in 1974-75.

In 2007 NHH announced the launching of a new master programme taught fully in English, the MSc in Energy, Natural Resources and the Environment.

Today, NHH is part of a global network of business schools and universities. International partner institutions include:

* Columbia University
* Cornell University
* University of California, Berkeley
* New York University
* Duke University
* HEC Paris
* Bocconi University
* London School of Economics
* Imperial College London

On June 1, 2011, the school simplified and changed its English name from the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration to the Norwegian School of Economics.

Like all public institutions of higher education in Norway, NHH does not charge tuition fees. However, a small semester fee of NOK 490 (roughly US$80) is charged. This money helps fund the Student Welfare Organisation in Bergen, which subsidises kindergartens, health services, housing and cultural initiatives.

The Student Association at NHH (NHHS) has groups to accommodate many student interests. As would be expected for a leading business school, NHHS has many groups involved with economics and business issues. These groups maintain contact with the business community and serve to stimulate interest in and improve knowledge of various sectors Norwegians and international business. This is achieved through conferences, seminars, company visits, excursions in Norway and abroad and trainee programs in various businesses. The Student Association is led by a board of eight people - Kjernestyret.

<text>This is a list of craters on Venus, named by the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature. All craters on Venus are named after famous women or female first names. &quot;(For features on Venus other than craters see, list of montes on Venus and List of coronae on Venus.)&quot;

As of 2017, there are 900 named craters on Venus, fewer than the lunar and Martian craters but more than on Mercury.

Other, non-planetary bodies with numerous named craters include Callisto (141), Ganymede (131), Rhea (128), Vesta (90), Ceres (90), Dione (73), Iapetus (58), Enceladus (53), Tethys (50) and Europa (41). For a full list, &quot;see List of craters in the Solar System&quot;.

<doc id="1145516" wikidata="Q7232112" url="?curid=1145516" title="Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway">
<text>The Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PB&amp;SSR) was a narrow gauge railway intended to connect Porthmadog (then spelled &quot;Portmadoc&quot;) with the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways link terminus at Rhyd Ddu. Although some of the line was constructed between 1901 and 1906, it never opened and eventually became part of the Welsh Highland Railway.

== History ==

There were several attempts by the North Wales Power and Traction Company to promote lines between Portmadoc and Beddgelert with extensions at either end. These culminated in a proposal in 1901, for a narrow gauge electric railway to use three phase alternating current at about 630 volts using the system devised by Ganz of Budapest.

===Proposed route===
The PB&amp;SSR would have run from the western end of Black Rock sands via Morfa Bychan, Borth y gest, Portmadoc and, using part of the Croesor Tramway, to Beddgelert to link with the South Snowdon Quarries (hence the title) in the Gwynant Valley. There was no intention initially to connect with the North Wales Narrow Gauge system which, at that time, terminated at , a station near the hamlet of Rhyd Ddu.

No railway construction was started but, by 1903, a revised scheme was being put forward to link up with the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways Beddgelert extension. This resulted in a further revised scheme being approved in 1904. It appears that there were legal problems with the powers given and, in 1906, these were reapproved with amendments.

===Construction===
Work started around 1906 and continued for a couple of years before being abandoned (certainly no work done after 1910). The line from Snowdon (Rhyd Ddu) was virtually complete for well over a mile and was used for a while (mainly during World War I) to extract timber from Beddgelert forest. At the Beddgelert end a roughly laid track for horse-drawn wagons was also used for timber.

The original intention to run to Black Rock had been forgotten and no mention was made of the line to South Snowdon quarries. However, in 1908, they did promote a further line up the Gwynant Valley and on to Betws y coed. No work was done on this line.

===Abandonment of the PBSSR===

The North Wales Power and Traction Co Ltd, the sole PBSSR backer, overspent on the construction of the power station. It started generating electricity in September 1906, but meanwhile, completion of the railway and electrifying the NWNGR took a back seat, and in January 1906 J.C. Russell, Chairman and Managing Director of the NWNGR, insisted on terms for a two-year delay which included expenditure on &quot;restoring the NWNGR for present steam working and providing one steam locomotive for a sum not exceeding £2,500&quot;. This resulted in the arrival of Russell as NWNGR property. In the event this delay led to an abandonment.

Sections of abandoned cuttings and embankments of the original route still survive in the Beddgelert area. These include an abandoned embankment, a completed bridge over the A498 at the southern end of Beddgelert village near the Royal Goat Hotel and nearby bridge abutments in a field. The abutments of the Afon Glaslyn bridge were also constructed and the one of the west bank is now a Welsh Water Authority measuring station.

===Welsh Highland Railway===
The PBSSR and North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways were later amalgamated and became the Welsh Highland Railway. Some work undertaken for the PBSSR was used for the Welsh Highland Railway.

==Motive power==
Ten electric locomotives were ordered from Bruce Peebles &amp; Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh who held a licence from Ganz. At least six were built, although none were delivered. All six were scrapped during the First World War. The electrification project was abandoned about 1906 and a steam locomotive &quot;Russell&quot; was ordered from the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds.

It was intended to electrify all the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways once the two lines were connected. In 1914, local councils got together to try to get the building restarted but failed due to the start of World War I. Another attempt was made after the war which resulted in the building of the Welsh Highland Railway following most of the same route but with changes made near Beddgelert to ease the gradients to allow the use of steam locos.

The electricity was to be produced at a hydro electric power station further up the Gwynant Valley and surplus power was to be available for local domestic and industrial use. This part of the scheme was actually built and the power station still operates.

<text>Peter Wilson Coldham, FASG (1926 – 2012 in London), was a British genealogist. He was noted as a &quot;distinguished scholar of colonial American immigration.&quot;

==Life==
In a genealogical format, his basic lineage is listed as; Peter Wilson Coldham-7 (Frederick Wilson Coldham-6, Henry Wilson Coldham-5, Henry James Coldham-4, Daniel Coldham-3, Daniel Coldham-2, Daniel Coldham-1).

He was the son of Frederick Wilson Coldham and Grace Clara Cutler. He later married Paulette Nagle (1928–2012 ) on 4 July 1953 in Purley, Surrey, England and had four children.
He wrote over 26 books and multiple monographs and magazine articles, including many standard works on Anglo-American genealogy.

After serving in the far east for the Royal Navy in the last year of the Second World War, Coldham joined the British Foreign Office and was posted to the British embassy in Belgrade 1954–1956. He subsequently worked at the Central Office of Information (COI) in London 1956-1987. 
In retirement he frequently worked at the British Public Record Office, now known as The National Archives, where he discovered unpublished material on the early American colonists. His resulting articles published in the National Genealogical Society Quarterly (NGSQ) led to his recognition and several awards of excellence. He pioneered the then neglected field of English convict transports to America and indentured servants.

His documentation and writing of the book &quot;Passengers and Ships to America, 1618–1668&quot; was cited by author Meredith B. Colket in 2002 as, &quot;the most important addition to our knowledge of early New England that has appeared in over a century.&quot;

==Awards==
Coldham was awarded the Julian Bickersteth memorial medal in 1991. He was a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists (FASG) and Fellow of the Society of Genealogists (FSG).

&quot;Peter Wilson Coldham has died, and the world of genealogical research has lost a remarkable man.&quot;

==Works==
===Important works===
The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775

Between 1614 and 1775 more than 50,000 English men, women, and children were sentenced to be deported to the American colonies for crimes ranging from the theft of a handkerchief to bigamy or highway robbery and sold as indentured servants for from 7 to 14 years depending upon the crime against the crown. After years of painstaking research, the names of nearly all those sentenced to penal transportation were extracted from official court records by Peter Coldham and published in the landmark work The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage in 1988 and its Supplement in 1992, forming the largest and most complete passenger list of its kind ever published. From this unexpected source the researcher at last had the means of learning the names of the persons transported to the colonies, the charges against them, the dates and places of sentencing, the ship names, and the places of arrival in the colonies.

Supplement to The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775

The original volume of Emigrants in Bondage published in 1988 acknowledged that there were some notable omissions from the list of transported felons then printed, which remained to be researched and remedied. The Supplement of 1992 began to supply the omissions, but with the publication of More Emigrants in Bondage, Mr. Coldham closed the remaining gaps. Altogether there are some 9,000 new and amended records in this important new work, which is arranged and annotated in the same way as the parent volume. To the original list of 50,000 records, these additions come as a windfall, arising from the availability of previously closed archival resources and the re-examination of conventional transportation records such as Assize Court records, Circuit Court records, and the quaintly-named Sheriffs&#x27; Cravings, to which can be added newspapers and printed memoirs.

The addition of 9,000 records to the canon makes this the most important list of ships&#x27; passengers to be published in years. Whether as a list of additions or corrections, this new work is an indispensable tool in the researcher&#x27;s arsenal, and anyone using the parent volume and supplement cannot possibly ignore this volume. Questions about the peopling of colonial America come readily to mind when looking at a book like this—questions about ancestors, too—and the answers found here are both challenging and surprising.

<doc id="1145520" wikidata="Q886624" url="?curid=1145520" title="Blood Wedding">
<text>Blood Wedding () is a tragedy by Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written in 1932 and first performed at Teatro Beatriz in Madrid in March 1933, then later that year in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The play is set in rural Spain and according to some sources was inspired by real life events which took place in Almeria in the 1920s. Theatre critics often group &quot;Blood Wedding&quot; with García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Yerma&quot; and &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; as the &quot;rural trilogy&quot;. García Lorca&#x27;s planned &quot;trilogy of the Spanish earth&quot; remained unfinished at the time of his death, as he did not include &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; in this group of works.

==Plot summary==

===Act one===
As the play opens, The Mother speaks with her son, The Groom. Act I reveals that The Groom&#x27;s father and brother were killed a few years ago by men from the Felix family. When The Groom asks for a knife to cut olives in the vineyard, The Mother reacts cautiously. Before giving The Groom the knife, she discusses the cycles of violence and her trepidation. The Groom leaves after hugging his mother goodbye.

The Neighbor arrives to chat with The Mother, and reveals to her that The Bride was previously involved with a man named Leonardo Felix, a relative of the men who killed The Mother&#x27;s husband. The Mother, who still hates the Felix family, is furious, but decides to visit the girl before bringing the matter up with The Groom.

Leonardo, who is now married, returns to his home after work. When he enters, The Mother-In-Law and Wife are singing a lullaby to Leonardo&#x27;s son. The lullaby&#x27;s lyrics foreshadow the tragedies that will occur later in the play. It is clear that Leonardo&#x27;s marriage is not a happy one. A Little Girl enters the house and tells the family that The Groom is preparing to marry The Bride. Leonardo flies into a rage, scaring his Wife, Mother-In-Law, and A Little Girl as he storms out of the house.

The Mother goes to The Bride&#x27;s house, along with The Groom, where she meets the Bride&#x27;s Servant and the Father of The Bride. The Father tells The Mother about his dead wife and his desire to see his daughter marry and bear children. The Bride enters and speaks with The Mother and The Groom. The Father then shows them out, leaving The Servant with The Bride. The Servant teases The Bride about the gifts that The Groom brought, then reveals to her that Leonardo has been coming to the house at night to watch The Bride&#x27;s window.

===Act two===
The morning of the wedding, Leonardo comes to see The Bride again. He speaks of his burning desire for her and the pride that kept him from marrying her before. The Bride, disturbed by his presence, attempts to silence him, but cannot deny that she still has feelings for him. The Servant sends Leonardo away, and the guests begin arriving for the wedding. The Father, The Mother, and The Groom arrive, and the wedding party moves to the church. The Bride begs The Groom to keep her safe. Leonardo and his Wife go as well, after a short and furious argument.

After the wedding, the guests, the families, and the newlywed couple return to the Bride&#x27;s house. The party progresses, with music and dancing, but the Bride retires to her room, claiming that she feels tired. Leonardo&#x27;s Wife tells the Groom that her husband left on horseback, but the Groom brushes her off, saying that Leonardo simply went for a quick ride. The Groom returns to the main room and speaks with his Mother. The guests then begin searching for the Bride and Groom, hoping to begin a traditional wedding dance. But the Bride is nowhere to be found. The Father orders the house searched, but Leonardo&#x27;s Wife bursts into the room and announces that her husband and the Bride have run off together. The Father refuses to believe it, but the Groom flies into a rage and rides off with a friend to kill Leonardo. The Mother, frenzied and furious, orders the entire wedding party out into the night to search for the runaways, as the Father collapses in grief.

===Act three===
Out in the forest (to which Leonardo and The Bride have fled), three woodcutters emerge to discuss the events (in a manner somewhat similar to that of a Greek chorus, except that they speak to each other, not to the audience). They reveal that the searchers have infiltrated the entire forest, and that Leonardo, who is, after all, carrying a woman, will be caught soon if the moon comes out. As they flee the stage, The Moon appears in the form of a young woodcutter with a white face. She states that by the end of the night, blood will be spilt. Death, disguised as an old beggar woman, enters and speaks of the finiteness of life and how the night will end in death. She orders The Moon to provide much light before exiting.

Up in fury, the Groom enters along with a Youth from the wedding party. The Youth is disturbed by the dark forest and urges the Groom to turn back, but the Groom refuses, vowing to kill Leonardo and reclaim his Bride. Death, disguised, re-enters, telling the Groom that she has seen Leonardo and can lead the Groom to him. The Groom exits with her.

Elsewhere, in the forest specifically, The Woodcutters are fervently chopping wood, praying that the lovers will be spared before exiting. Leonardo and The Bride run on and discuss their future together. Both are filled with romantic angst and consumed by their burning, unsustainable love for each other, as passion like no other is shared between the two of them. The Bride begs Leonardo to flee, but he refuses. The couple hear footsteps; the Groom and Death are coming near. Leonardo exits, and two screams ring out in the darkness. The Moon and Beggar woman reappear at the end of the scene. Leonardo and the Groom have killed each other.

In the town, the women (including Leonardo&#x27;s wife and mother-in-Law) have gathered near the church to whisper of the events. Death arrives in the disguise of the beggar woman and, before departing, announces that doom has visited the forest. The Mother enters the church, full of anger and black bitterness, only to see The Bride returning—her dress covered in the blood of her lovers who killed each other in the forest. Presumably (although this is never explicitly stated, and it happens after the play&#x27;s end), The Bride is afterwards killed as a sacrifice to restore the family&#x27;s honour. Still, in some incarnations of the play, it is suggested that The Mother allows The Bride to live based on the idea that living with the pain of her lovers&#x27; deaths is a more severe punishment than death.

<text>In Unix-like systems, multiple users can be put into &quot;groups&quot;. POSIX and conventional Unix file system permissions are organized into three classes, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, and &quot;others&quot;. The use of groups allows additional abilities to be delegated in an organized fashion, such as access to disks, printers, and other peripherals. This method, among others, also enables the superuser to delegate some administrative tasks to normal users, similar to the &quot;Administrators&quot; group on Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives.

A group identifier, often abbreviated to GID, is a numeric value used to represent a specific group. The range of values for a GID varies amongst different systems; at the very least, a GID can be between 0 and 32,767, with one restriction: the login group for the superuser must have GID 0. This numeric value is used to refer to groups in the codice_1 and codice_2 files or their equivalents. Shadow password files and Network Information Service also refer to numeric GIDs. The group identifier is a necessary component of Unix file systems and processes.

== Supplementary groups ==
In Unix systems, every user must be a member of at least one group, the primary group, which is identified by the numeric GID of the user&#x27;s entry in the passwd database, which can be viewed with the command codice_3 (usually stored in codice_4 or LDAP). This group is referred to as the &quot;primary group ID&quot;. A user may be listed as member of additional groups in the relevant entries in the group database, which can be viewed with codice_5 (usually stored in codice_2 or LDAP); the IDs of these groups are referred to as &quot;supplementary group IDs&quot;.

== Effective vs. real ==
Unix processes have an effective (EUID, EGID), a real (UID, GID) and a saved (SUID, SGID) ID. Normally these are identical, but in codice_7 and codice_8 processes they are different.

== Conventions ==

=== Type ===

Originally, a signed 16-bit integer was used. Since the sign was not necessary – negative numbers do not make valid group IDs – an unsigned integer is now used instead, allowing group IDs between 0 and 65,535. Modern operating systems usually use unsigned 32-bit integers, which allow for group IDs between 0 and 4,294,967,295.

=== Reserved ranges ===

Many Linux systems reserve the GID number range 0 to 99 for statically allocated groups, and either 100−499 or 100−999 for groups dynamically allocated by the system in post-installation scripts. These ranges are often specified in codice_9, for codice_10, codice_11 and similar tools.

On FreeBSD, porters who need a GID for their package can pick a free one from the range 50 to 999 and then register this static allocation in ports/GIDs.

=== Special values ===

* 0: The superuser normally has a GID of zero (0).
* −1: The value codice_12 is reserved by POSIX to identify an omitted argument.
* 65,534: The Linux kernel defaults to 216−2 = 65,534 (which many Linux distributions map to the group name &quot;nogroup&quot;) when a 32-bit GID does not fit into the return value of a 16-bit system call. The value is also returned by idmapd if a group name in an incoming NFSv4 packet does not match any known group on the system.

== Personal groups ==

Many system administrators allocate for each user also a personal primary group that has the same name as the user&#x27;s login name, and often also has the same numeric GID as the user&#x27;s UID. Such personal groups have no other members and make collaboration with other users in shared directories easier, by allowing users to habitually work with codice_13. This way, newly created files can have by default write permissions enabled for group members, because this will normally only enable write access for members of the personal group, that is only for the file&#x27;s owner. However, if a file is created in a shared directory that belongs to another group and has the setgid bit set, then the created file will automatically become writable to members of that directory&#x27;s group as well.

On many Linux systems, the codice_14 variable in codice_9 controls whether commands like codice_10 or codice_17 automatically add or delete an associated personal group.

<doc id="1145524" wikidata="Q944112" url="?curid=1145524" title="Yerma">
<text>Yerma is a play by the Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written in 1934 and first performed that same year. García Lorca describes the play as &quot;a tragic poem.&quot; The play tells the story of a childless woman living in rural Spain. Her desperate desire for motherhood becomes an obsession that eventually drives her to commit a horrific crime.

==Plot==
* Act 1, scene 1:
Yerma has been married two years. She wants to strengthen her husband, Juan, so he can give her children. Telling Yerma to stay at home, Juan goes back to his work in the olive groves, and Yerma talks and sings to the child she wishes she were carrying. Yerma fears that if she doesn&#x27;t conceive soon, her blood will turn to poison. María, married five months and already pregnant, asks Yerma to sew for the baby. The couple&#x27;s friend, Víctor, sees Yerma sewing and assumes she is pregnant. His advice when he learns the truth: Try harder.
*Act 1, scene 2:
Yerma has just taken Juan his dinner in the fields. On the road home, she encounters an old woman who insists that passion is the key to conception. Yerma admits a secret longing for Víctor but none for Juan. She then meets two girls whose attitudes astonish her. One has left her baby untended. The other is childless and glad of it, although her mother, Dolores, is giving her herbs for pregnancy. Next Víctor comes along, and the conversation between Víctor and Yerma becomes tense with unspoken thoughts and desires. Juan enters, worrying about what people will say if Yerma stays out chatting. He
tells her he intends to work all night. Yerma will sleep alone.
*Act 2, scene 1:
It is three years later. Five laundresses gossip about a woman who still has no children, who has been looking at another man, and whose husband has brought in his sisters to keep an eye on her. We know they mean Yerma. The laundresses sing about husbands, lovemaking, and babies.
*Act 2, scene 2:
Juan&#x27;s two sisters watch over Yerma. She refuses to stay at home, and people are talking. Without children in it, her house seems like a prison to her. Her marriage has turned bitter. María visits, but reluctantly since the sight of her baby always makes Yerma weep. The childless girl says her mother, Dolores, is expecting Yerma. Víctor comes in to say goodbye. Yerma is surprised and a little saddened by Víctor&#x27;s announcement to go. When she asks him why he must go he answers along the lines of “things change.” Juan enters and it is later found out that Juan has bought Víctor&#x27;s sheep. It would seem that Juan is one of the reasons why Víctor is leaving. Yerma is angered, and when Juan goes out with Víctor, Yerma makes her escape to see Dolores.

*Act 3, scene 1:
Yerma is found at Dolores&#x27;s house. Dolores and the old woman have been praying over Yerma all night in the cemetery. Juan accuses Yerma of deceit, and she curses her blood, her body, and her father 
&quot;who gave me his blood, enough for a hundred children.&quot;

*Act 3, scene 2:
The scene begins near a hermitage high in the mountains, a place to which many barren women, including Yerma, have made a pilgrimage. Young men are there, hoping to father a child or to win a woman away from her husband. The old woman tells Yerma to leave Juan and take up with her son, who is &quot;made of blood,&quot; but Yerma holds to her sense of honor and dismisses that thought. Juan overhears and tells Yerma to give up wanting a child, to be content with what she has. Realizing that Juan never did and never will want a child, Yerma strangles him, thus killing her only hope of ever bearing a child. The play ends with Yerma saying, &quot;Don’t come near me, because I’ve killed my child. I’ve killed my child with my own hands!&quot;

==Characters==
*Yerma: a young woman whose desire for a child is so strong that she speaks and sings to the not-yet-created baby. Because her marriage seems to be without love, she believes a child will bring her the joy she so desperately seeks. She feels empty and unfulfilled without a child, but is not able to achieve success with her distant husband Juan. However unhappy she may be in her marriage, she refuses to leave him because of her overwhelming sense of honor and duty. Her name is the feminine version of the adjective &quot;yermo&quot;, meaning &quot;barren.&quot;
*Juan: Yerma&#x27;s husband. He does not believe in the child that could be but only in what can be seen and touched. His job is to till the land and help the earth grow, but his wife, whose name means barren land, is left without a child. He is very self-conscious about what others think.
*Víctor: an old friend of Yerma and Juan. He is a fellow worker of the land. He appears a few times within the play, usually with only Yerma. There may have been something in the past between the two of them, but he was not chosen by her father.
*María: Yerma&#x27;s newly married friend. She is having a baby, and Yerma is saddened by this fact.
*Dolores: a woman said to have the powers to help a barren woman get pregnant.
*Two sisters-in-law (Las Cuñadas): Juan&#x27;s sisters who are called on in the second act to watch over Yerma.
*Old woman (La Vieja): the voice of reason for Yerma in acts one and two. She is first seen on Yerma&#x27;s walk to bring Juan food. The old woman gives Yerma advice on how to keep a man and what a woman must do. She has been married twice and has had fourteen children in total. In act three she mentions to Yerma that she has a very available son and that he would be able to give her children.
*Six washerwomen: the voice of the town. They represent the various thoughts of the citizens. Some blame Yerma for her lack of children, some are indifferent, others speak up for Yerma.

==Themes==
Yerma deals with the themes of isolation, passion, and frustration but also the underlying themes of nature, marriage, jealousy, and friendship. Social conventions of the period also play a large part in the play&#x27;s plot.
The character Yerma, the name meaning barren, is a younger woman with no children. She marries Juan out of &quot;honor&quot; and duty to her father. She is surrounded by a society that feels that women have a duty to their husband to provide them with heirs. Most of the town&#x27;s people blame Yerma for her inability to conceive. There also seems to be no love within this marriage, and at times she considers that the reason why she cannot have children. It is hinted in the play that she may have feelings for another man, but she refuses to express these feelings because of a strong sense of duty to her husband. Even when the old woman tells her that she has a very fertile son that she can go off with, Yerma refuses by replying, &quot;What about my honour? . . . Did you really think that I could go with another man? That I’d go and beg him for what’s already mine?&quot; There are also overflowing themes of &quot;power&quot; and &quot;struggle&quot;. Throughout the play it would seem that Yerma had little or no power in her situation. She had no baby but without the consent of her husband, she has no other options. Her struggle is between her duty to her husband and her inner want of a child. She wants a child not only because she longs for one but also because during the time that she lives that&#x27;s all a woman could hope for. Unlike a man, who has the land and his work, a woman has nothing but the care of a child to get her through the day, and she lives day by day without that. Her inner struggle is too great toward the end, and she commands power as she strangles Juan to his death. She has finally stood up for what she wanted and at the same time killed her only chances.

==Pagan influence==
“Yerma” has many Christian morals such as marrying for the main reason to procreate and not going outside of the marriage to fix any problems. García Lorca uses the strict rules of the Christian religion to depict Yerma as one not able to act upon natural human drives. As Robert Lima details in his article &quot;Toward the Dionysiac: Pagan Elements and Rites in &quot;Yerma&quot;,&quot; García Lorca writes of the naturalness of the pagan ways throughout the play, using as vehicles characters such as the old woman, events such as the pilgrimage, and the four Empedoclean or &quot;classical&quot; elements, all providing contrast against Christian morals and their operation and effects. The four elements (earth, water, fire, and wind) are noted in the play both directly and indirectly. The elements have been known to represent the four seasons of the year, the four “humors” that represent human temperament, and the four points of the compass. Usually when the elements appear they constitute the foundation of all that exists. García Lorca uses the elements to create a symbolic pattern ironic in that it is Yerma who often refers to the pagan elements yet cannot assimilate them.

Earth is first noted in Yerma&#x27;s offstage lullaby at the beginning of the play when she sings she will make a hut in the field to shelter the child, with the field representing the element Earth. Earth is the element that is representative of mothering and nurturing. This element is the most instinctive in Yerma. In the play she tells of the times when she goes outdoors just to feel her bare feet on the ground. She senses that she must have physical contact with the soil which identifies her with Earth. Juan is also associated with the Earth because of his job in the fields. His life is in the fields, and he is able to fertilize all the soil except that of Yerma. What Yerma does not realize is that to get Juan to want her, she must yield to him as the Earth would do and let go of her fantasy if she has any hope to have a child.

The next element, water, is the one that Juan lacks the most. He only has a limited supply of water to irrigate the fields; all that water must go to the land, which means Yerma has no water to quench her thirst. She indistinctly notices that Juan is lacking water and tells him that she would like him to go to the river and swim or go to the roof when the rain drenches the roof. Her mentioning water in two different situations alludes to the fact that she wants Juan to have more water within himself. The symbol of immersion in water can sometimes imply “rebirth.” In contrast, the other male character, Víctor, has a more positive relation to water. There is one instance where Yerma hears Víctor singing offstage and tells him how well he sings and how it sounds like a torrent of water filling his mouth. Her association with him and water reinforce what the old woman said about children rushing to water. Yerma, however, is too late for the very plentiful water of Víctor. The next instance of water is the “cold brook” where the washerwomen gather. This represents Yerma&#x27;s inability to get pregnant and Juan&#x27;s coldness to the idea. Both the elements Earth and water are feminine elements, but they cannot be complete without the masculine elements air and fire.

Air is seen as male because of the association with “the breath of life” and dynamics of storms and winds. In conjunction with that, air is the medium in which movement occurs and is also the element that surrounds everything in nature. This is suggestive of the male&#x27;s sexual embrace of a woman. Air is featured many times throughout the play. It is mentioned when Yerma speaks of the wind singing in the trees and when she raises her arms and yawns, which is significant of the deep ritualistic inhalation of the air that made the Earth fertile. Since Yerma cannot be like the Earth and yield or be passive, she must be active in the manifestation of her sexuality. This is what the old woman tried to tell Yerma, and because the old woman is as free as air, she has had two husbands and given birth to fourteen children. Air is also a subject of interest when Juan berates Yerma for her obsession &quot;with things that drift in the air.&quot; Juan, again, does not exhibit the masculine nature that Yerma desperately hopes for. Víctor, however, embodies the masculine element. In one instance, Yerma goes to the spot where he last stood and takes a deep breath to inhale natural virility. She realizes that he has always had the potential to fill her fully, but alas she is too late and out of honor chooses to stay with Juan.

Lastly there is fire, the other male element that carries with it varied meanings. In some traditions, it functioned as purgation, transmutation, and regeneration. Fire also has a traditional association with well-being or ill-health. In Celtic Europe fire was used in major rituals in which bonfires and torches were used to promote fertility of the fields, animals, and humans. One sense of the element fire in Yerma is that of passion, or lack thereof. Yerma mentions how Juan&#x27;s face lacks the color of life and how his pale skin has not been touched by the fire of the sun&#x27;s rays. In contrast, Víctor&#x27;s passionate nature is evident in his life and inner fire. It is toward the end where we see fire start to be represented indirectly with Yerma. She tells Juan how unfair it is for her to be consumed, making reference to fire and being a victim. Wanting to cease being a victim, she goes off to change things for herself. In the end, Juan&#x27;s lack of passion has fueled her flaming desire to have a child even more. The fact that she goes to the hermitage, where woman walk barefoot on the soil, makes reference to her initial association with the earth. Finally, with Juan stating that he will never want children, Yerma is taken over by her passion. Juan is consumed by her fiery frustration and is finally killed.

==Legacy==
Ian Gibson suggests that &quot;Yerma&quot; is the work of García Lorca&#x27;s most directly associated with his assassination in the early days of the Spanish Civil War. It most openly challenges the institution of Catholicism and the strict sexual morality of contemporary Spanish society.

* Paul Bowles composed an opera based on &quot;Yerma&quot; in 1955.
* Heitor Villa-Lobos composed an opera based on the play; it was premiered in 1971.
* In 2001 Pilar Távora directed a version in Spanish (&quot;Yerma&quot;), starring Aitana Sánchez-Gijón.
* The play &quot;In the Red and Brown Water&quot; by Tarell Alvin McCraney, written circa 2007, is a loose adaptation of &quot;Yerma&quot; set in a housing project in Louisiana.

===2016 revival===
In 2016, Australian playwright Simon Stone premiered an adaption at the Young Vic, starring Billie Piper. The play was an enormous success receiving rave reviews, namely for Piper&#x27;s &quot;earth-quaking&quot; performance. The play went on to become one of the most acclaimed and awarded of the decade, with Piper winning all six available Best Actress theatre awards, including the coveted Laurence Olivier Award, fending off competition from Glenda Jackson. The play saw an unparalleled number of five-star reviews with Piper being described as &quot;dangerously draining&quot;, &quot;searing, stunning and unmissable&quot;. It also won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Revival. It played a second run from July to August 2017 with two live broadcasts to cinemas in the UK on 31 August and international cinemas on 21 September. Encore performances were later added after demand surged.

In October 2017, it was announced that Piper would transfer with the show to New York City in 2018. The play was a sold out hit playing for six weeks at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City and was hailed by US critics. The New York Times said Piper&#x27;s performance was &quot;an unconditional victory&quot; and &quot;blisteringly powerful&quot; awarding it five stars, whilst Hollywood Reporter found her &quot;simply staggering&quot; adding; &quot;When the actress appears at the curtain call, looking emotionally and physical exhausted, you find yourself relieved that she&#x27;s OK and concerned that she&#x27;ll have to do it all over again the next night.&quot; Time Out likened Piper to an &quot;angry beast&quot; warning that her &quot;astonishing&quot; performance inflicted psychological-like emotions on the audience. NBC&#x27;s Katie Englehart said &quot;Piper is so devastating I almost vomited in my seat - that doesn&#x27;t sound like an endorsement but it is.&quot; Vogue hailed Piper as &quot;one of the great talents of her generation&quot; and described her performance as &quot;astonishing, raw, feral and terrifying.&quot; The AM New York critic claimed to be left &quot;gasping for air&quot; whilst the New York Stage Review found Piper&#x27;s &quot;downward spiral into abyss utterly harrowing and blazingly remarkable.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy. Commissioned in 1897, she was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1905. After a refit, she was temporarily put in reserve before returning to service with the Channel Fleet in September 1905. In 1908 and rendered obsolete by the emergence of the dreadnought type of battleships, she once again returned to the reserve, this time with the Home Fleet. After another refit, she had a spell as a gunnery training ship in 1912.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Jupiter&quot; served with the Channel Fleet and then as a guard ship on the River Tyne. She was dispatched to Russia in February 1915 to serve as an icebreaker, clearing a route to Arkhangelsk while the regular icebreaker was undergoing a refit. She underwent her own refit later in 1915 and once completed, was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol. She returned to England late 1916, and spent the remainder of the war based at Devonport. She was scrapped in 1920.

== Design ==

HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube Scotch marine boilers. By 1907–1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. &quot;Jupiter&quot; also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel in their belt armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed &quot;Jupiter&quot; and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armor, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship&#x27;s armored deck was thick.

== Operational history ==
HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; was laid down by J &amp; G Thomson, Clydebank at Clydebank on 26 April 1894 and launched on 18 November 1895. In February 1897 she was transferred to Chatham Dockyard, where she was completed in May 1897. She was commissioned on 8 June 1897 at Chatham Dockyard for service in the Channel Fleet. She was present at both the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897 and the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902. Captain John Durnford was appointed in command in October 1899, followed by Captain Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne from December 1900. In March 1901 she visited Cork. The following year she was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete for combined manoeuvres between the Channel and Mediterranean fleets in September and October. Captain Sir Richard Poore was appointed in command in December 1902. On 1 January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the new Atlantic Fleet, making her an Atlantic Fleet unit. She was paid off at Chatham on 27 February 1905 to undergo a refit there, and her Atlantic Fleet service ended when she emerged from refit and was commissioned at Chatham into the Portsmouth Reserve on 15 August 1905. &quot;Jupiter&quot; was commissioned for service in the new Channel Fleet on 20 September 1905. This service ended on 3 February 1908 when she was paid off. By this time, &quot;Jupiter&quot; had been surpassed in the role of front-line battleship by the new &quot;all-big-gun&quot; dreadnought battleships inaugurated by in 1906.

On 4 February 1908, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was recommissioned for reserve service in the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet with a nucleus crew. She was flagship of the division from February to June 1909 and later second flagship of the 3rd Division, Home Fleet. During this service, she underwent refits at Portsmouth in 1909–1910, during which she received fire control equipment for her main battery, and 1911–1912. From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore. In January 1913 she was transferred to the 3rd Fleet, and was based at Pembroke Dock and Devonport.

=== First World War ===
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron of the Channel Fleet. During this service, she covered the passage of the British Expeditionary Force from England to France in September 1914. In late October 1914, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was reassigned to serve alongside her sister ship as a guard ship at the Nore. On 3 November 1914, &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; left the Nore and relieved their sister ships and of guard ship duty on the Humber. In December 1914, &quot;Jupiter&quot; moved on to guard ship duty on the Tyne. On 5 February 1915, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was detached from her guard ship duty to serve temporarily as an icebreaker at Arkhangelsk, Russia, while the regular icebreaker there was under refit. In this duty, &quot;Jupiter&quot; made history by becoming the first ship ever to get through the ice into Arkhangelsk during the winter; her February arrival was the earliest in history there, although her bow was severely damaged by the voyage.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; left Arkhangelsk in May 1915 to return to the Channel Fleet, and was paid off at Birkenhead on 19 May 1915. She then began a refit by Cammell Laird there that lasted until August 1915. Her refit completed, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was commissioned at Birkenhead on 12 August 1915 for service in the Mediterranean Sea on the Suez Canal Patrol. On 21 October 1915, she was transferred to the Red Sea to become guard ship at Aden and flagship of the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Patrol. She was relieved of flagship duty by the troopship of the Royal Indian Marine on 9 December 1915 and returned to the Suez Canal Patrol for Mediterranean service. This lasted from April to November 1916, with a home port in Port Said, Egypt.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; left Egypt on 22 November 1916 and returned to the United Kingdom, where she was paid off at Devonport to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Devonport until April 1919, in commission as a special service vessel and auxiliary patrol ship until February 1918, when she was again paid off. After that she became an accommodation ship. In April 1919, &quot;Jupiter&quot; became the first &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ship to be placed on the disposal list. She was sold for scrapping on 15 January 1920, and on 11 March 1920 was towed from Chatham to Blyth to be scrapped.

<text>The Republic of Vietnam national football team (Vietnamese: &quot;Đội tuyển bóng đá quốc gia Việt Nam Cộng hòa&quot;) or the State of Vietnam national football team (Vietnamese: &quot;Đội tuyển bóng đá Quốc gia Việt Nam&quot;) was the national football team from 1949 to 1975 representing the State of Vietnam and later the Republic of Vietnam, known as &quot;South Vietnam&quot;.

The State of Vietnam joined the International Association Football Federation (FIFA) in 1952 and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954. The South Vietnamese football association was treated by these bodies as the only legitimate Vietnamese association, as the State of Vietnam and later the Republic of Vietnam claimed sovereignty over all of Vietnam from 1949 to 1975. The team started to play under the State of Vietnam in January 1949, two months before France recognized Vietnamese nominal independence. After the State of Vietnam gained complete independence from France in June 1954 and Vietnam was divided in July, it existed side by side with a separate North Vietnam team, which represented the Communist-controlled northern portion of the country from 1956 to 1976. Unlike its southern counterpart, the latter was never allowed to join FIFA or the AFC. South Vietnam took part in the first two Asian Cups finals (1956 and 1960), finishing last both times. Despite the fierce wars, it was one of strongest teams in Southeast Asia.

The South Vietnam team played their last games at 1976 AFC Asian Cup qualification in March 1975, and ceased to exist after the Fall of Saigon in April, when the Vietnam War ended. The North and South regions combined into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976, with the Vietnam national team replacing both the North and South teams. The unified republic was allowed to keep South Vietnam&#x27;s membership of FIFA and the AFC, resulting in the South Vietnam team&#x27;s historical record usually being counted as part of the overall record of the Vietnam national team, while results for the North Vietnam team are not commonly included as part of the record.

<doc id="1145536" wikidata="Q8056967" url="?curid=1145536" title="You Bought It – You Name It">
<text>You Bought It – You Name It is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. The album was released in mid 1983, on the label Warner Bros., two years after Walsh&#x27;s successful album &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;. It was Walsh&#x27;s second and final studio album to feature George &quot;Chocolate&quot; Perry as producer.

The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. It was also not as successful as Walsh&#x27;s previous albums, peaking at #48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, Walsh found some moderate success with the single &quot;Space Age Whiz Kids&quot;, about the pinnacle of the 1980s video arcade craze. The single peaked at #52 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and at #21 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. An outtake from &quot;The Long Run&quot; (1979), &quot;Told You So&quot; features a guest appearance from former Eagles&#x27; member Don Felder (who also co-wrote the track). The album also features contributions from two other Eagles&#x27; members Don Henley, and Timothy B. Schmit, as well as former REO Speedwagon lead singer Mike Murphy, session guitarist Waddy Wachtel, and the drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh&#x27;s former band Barnstorm.

==Cover artwork==
The cover art for the album features an American aircraft carrier, USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;, at the Battle of Midway after being hit by enemy bombers that appears to be on fire (smoke is coming out of the funnel from damage to the funnel uptakes and engineering spaces). There is also someone in a fireman suit that has his feet up on the bench behind Walsh who is sitting on the bench next to him, while reading a book titled &quot;Aircraft Carrier&quot;. On the back sleeve of the album, Walsh is holding a photograph of the fireman suit with the face cut out so his face appears through it. Additionally, the single release of the song &quot;Space Age Whiz Kids&quot; used the same image of Walsh.

==Production and recording==
After the success of his album &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;, Walsh decided that it was time to record its follow-up, and in July 1982, Walsh asked Bill Szymczyk to produce his new album and Walsh came up with the idea that he was going to rent a 2-inch 16-track non Dolby mobile truck to record the album, but Szymczyk disagreed with the idea completely, and Walsh immediately fired him. They later decided to record the album there and began working on the album in late September that year. They went to the Santa Catalina Island outside of Los Angeles for a 14-day recording session and recorded six of the album&#x27;s ten tracks in an old ballroom on the island. The other four tracks for the album were recorded in a different studio; the album was not finished until the end of the year. The album contains hard rock songs such as &quot;I Can Play That Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and a cover of the Dick Haymes track &quot;Love Letters&quot;. It also contains more introspective material such as &quot;Class of &#x27;65&quot;, and a song titled &quot;I.L.B.T.s&quot;, an initialization for &quot;I Like Big Tits&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review, music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the album is &quot;Joe Walsh&#x27;s Comedy Album&quot; adding that the album features &quot;one pop standard gone studio-reggae, the ultimate (last?) video-game song, a cross between &quot;Boobs a Lot&quot; and &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Hits,&quot; &quot;Class of &#x27;65&quot; for bathetic relief, and a song called &quot;I Can Play That Rock &amp; Roll&quot; that isn&#x27;t stupid (though it comes close).&quot; In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic James Chrispell wrote of the album &quot;Rather retro in feel, like the title, it harkens back to a wackier time. Good, but flawed.&quot;

<text>The Vietnam national football team () represents Vietnam in men&#x27;s senior international association football and is controlled by the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF), the governing body of football in Vietnam. The team&#x27;s nickname is the Golden Star Warriors ().

Association football was introduced to Vietnam by the French in the late 19th century during the French colonial period, and Vietnam played their first game in Saigon on 16 January 1949. However, because various conflicts occurred in the country in the 20th century, Vietnam was split into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (representing the communist-controlled North) and the State of Vietnam, later the Republic of Vietnam (representing the capitalist-controlled South), beginning in 1949 and 1954. As a result, two national teams (one for the North and one for the South) existed simultaneously and were controlled by separate governing football bodies. While South Vietnam (past Vietnam) became a member of both International Association Football Federation (FIFA) in 1952 and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954, North Vietnam never held memberships in either. After North and South were unified into a single country in 1976, the separate governing bodies were combined into the Vietnam Football Federation. However, the current unified Vietnam also inherited South Vietnam&#x27;s membership in FIFA, therefore Vietnamese team is considered a successor to the South Vietnamese team, while North Vietnamese team is considered a separate team for statistical purposes.

For the first years of its history, re-unified Vietnam experienced a prolonged international football hiatus and no senior national team matches were played between unification in 1976 and participation in the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) football tournament of 1991, which was for national teams but not U23 teams like today. The 1991 SEA tournament marked the re-integration of Vietnam into international football, with the senior Vietnam national team subsequently winning three ASEAN Championships and reaching the final round of FIFA World Cup qualification in 2022. Vietnam also reached the quarter-finals of the AFC Asian Cup twice, in 2007 and 2019.

==History==
===Early history (1896–1949)===

The introduction of football into Vietnam can be traced back to 1896, during the era of colonial French Cochinchina in the South. At first, the sport was only played among French civil servants, merchants, and soldiers. The French encouraged natives to play football and other introduced sports, partly to divert their interest from politics but also because of local enthusiasm. Football subsequently spread to the northern and central regions. On 20 July 1908, the newspaper &quot;Southern Luc Tan Van&quot; reported on a match between two local Vietnamese teams for the first time. A football guidebook published in 1925 by Vietnamese doctor Pham Van Tiec attracted interest among Vietnamese youth. By 1928, the Vietnamese had established the Annamite Sports Bureau and in the same year they sent a football team to compete in Singapore. More local football clubs then established in northern and southern Vietnam. However, it was not until after World War II that football clubs in the region started to become more organized.

Under French colonial rule, the French Indochina Football Federation hosted a few matches against other national teams, fielding a selection composed mainly of players from Saigon or the French Cochinchina football league. Notably, they faced the China in 1936 and 1948. In April 1947, the French Indochina Football Federation selection team went for a tour in British Hong Kong, and played against British Hong Kong national team.

Two months before independence accords, the earliest recognized international game of Vietnam was on 16 January 1949, in a 3-3 draw against South Korea in Saigon, French Cochinchina. This team would become South Vietnamese team following the political division of the country in 1954.

===Two national teams (1949–1975)===
Two national football teams existed side by side from 1956 to 1970, during the period Vietnam was divided into North and South Vietnam (1954–76). The southern team appeared in a friendly in 1949 and participated in the first two AFC Asian Cup finals (1956 AFC Asian Cup and 1960 AFC Asian Cup) and earned two fourth-place finishes. They won the first Southeast Asian Games gold in 1959 in Bangkok (Thailand) as well as two times won silver medals and three times won bronze medals. South Vietnam reached quarter-finals of the Asian Games 1958 and fourth place of the Asian Games 1962. South Vietnam even qualified for the 1956 Summer Olympics after defeating Cambodia in both home and away matches but then refused to participate in the finals in Australia. The team also attempted to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, beating Thailand 1–0 to qualify for the classification matches. They ultimately lost their group opening matches by 4–0 to Japan and 1–0 to Hong Kong. The team played their last game in a 0-3 loss against Malaysia in 1975 and as a result of the fall of Saigon later, the team was disbanded. Despite the fierce wars, they were still one of strongest teams in Southeast Asia. Before the division, South Vietnamese football association became a member of FIFA in 1952 and the AFC in 1954; therefore South Vietnam was more integrated than the North and South Vietnamese football association was treated by these bodies as the only legitimate Vietnamese one as South Vietnam claimed sovereignty over all of Vietnam from 1949 to 1975. Meanwhile, the northern team was much less active than the South and tended to be closed, North Vietnam was never a member of either AFC or FIFA. Between 1956 and 1966 they often played against other communist states. Their first game was a 5-3 loss to China PR under head coach Truong Tan Buu on 4 October 1956 and their played last game was a 3-2 win over Cuba. They participated in the first GANEFO (Games of the New Emerging Forces) competitions in Indonesia in 1962 and Cambodia in 1966. The team played their last game in 1970. North and South regions ceased to exist when they were &quot;de jure&quot; reunited into the Socialist Republic in 1976 following the end of the Vietnam War. Because South Vietnam was a member of FIFA (from 1952), the current unified Vietnam is classified as its successor by FIFA.

The development of football during this era for both Vietnams stagnated due to the coincident Vietnam War. Having been a significant football force in the region, Vietnam&#x27;s reputation diminished. The conflict also greatly reduced Vietnamese footballing ability and weakened the country generally. Moreover, the subsequent Cambodian–Vietnamese War and Sino–Vietnamese War, combined with global sanctions against the country, depleted the nation&#x27;s football team and turned Vietnam into one of the weakest teams in the world. For these reasons, Vietnamese football remains new and unknown to much of the rest of the world. Despite its long-standing history of football, Vietnam only rejoined the global football community in 1991.

Vietnam&#x27;s professional football league, known as the All Vietnam Football Championship, was launched in 1980 to redevelop Vietnamese football after the war. In 1989, following the &quot;Đổi Mới&quot; reforms, a new football federation was formed. Most Vietnamese sports returned to the international stage. After three months of preparation, in August 1989, the First Congress of the new football federation took place in Hanoi, declaring the formation of the Vietnam Football Federation. Trịnh Ngọc Chữ, deputy minister of the General Department of Sports, was elected as the first president of VFF.

===Post-Vietnam War and redevelopment (1991–2006)===
The reunified Vietnam national football team joined the international stage by participating in the 1991 edition of the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in the Philippines. They have participated in every subsequent SEA Games tournament. Since 1994, Vietnam has consistently participated in qualification for the FIFA World Cup, and in qualification for the AFC Asian Cup (since 1996).

Vietnam participated for the first time as a unified nation in FIFA World Cup qualification during the 1994 World Cup campaign, having participated in the 1974 qualification as South Vietnam. The national side failed to qualify for the 1994 and 1998 tournaments with only one qualifying win in total.

In 1996, Vietnam finished third in the first (1996) ASEAN Football Federation championship (then known as the Tiger Cup). Vietnam hosted the second Tiger Cup in 1998, losing 1–0 to Singapore in the final. From 2000 to 2007, Vietnam strove to win the Southeast Asian trophy, but invariably failed. In 1996, Vietnam created international headlines by inviting Italian giant Juventus, the reigning 1995–96 UEFA Champions League champion, to play in a friendly match in Hanoi. Despite the 2-1 loss, the match was a watershed moment that boosted the development of football in the country.

Vietnam was the host of the 1999 Dunhill Cup, a friendly tournament for both senior and U-23 players. Because it was categorized as a mingled senior and U-23 competition, some national teams decided to use their senior reserve sides. In this competition, Vietnam performed promisingly. The highlight was a shock 1–0 win over Russia (then-1994 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1996 participant); they also drew 2–2 with 1998 FIFA World Cup participant Iran, thereby topping the group. Vietnam was then eliminated in the semi-finals after a 4–1 defeat to China.

Vietnam&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign had some bright moments, with the team winning three matches and drawing one, all played in Dammam. However, the losses against Saudi Arabia, meant that Vietnam did not qualify for the World Cup. The 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification was also unsuccessful, with Vietnam falling to South Korea and Oman, but managing to create a shock 1–0 win over 2002 FIFA World Cup&#x27;s fourth-place-getter South Korea in Muscat, one of Vietnam&#x27;s greatest football feats. The 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification was a low point for Vietnam, with the team once again failing, losing to South Korea and Lebanon, and only finishing above Maldives on goal difference.

===Renaissance (2007–2009)===
Vietnam hosted the 2007 AFC Asian Cup along with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, despite having failed to qualify for the Asian Cup since the 1990s. The team was ranked second lowest only after Malaysia, but Vietnam created a shock by defeating the UAE 2–0, drawing 1–1 with another Gulf team, Qatar, before losing 1–4 to defending champions Japan. Vietnam were the only Southeast Asian and host team to reach the quarter-finals, in which they lost to eventual champions Iraq 2–0. This marked the beginning of the first Vietnamese football upsurge.

Vietnam won their first AFF Championship title in 2008. They were placed in Group B with Thailand, Malaysia, and Laos. After losing to Thailand 2–0 in the opener, Vietnam defeated Malaysia 3–2 and Laos 4–0. In the semi-final, Vietnam held the defending champion Singapore to 0–0 at home before winning 1–0 away, making the final for the first time in 10 years. Vietnam met Thailand again in the final. They defeated Thailand 2-1 in the first leg in Thailand. Returning home, Vietnam salvaged a 1-1 draw by virtue of Lê Công Vinh&#x27;s last-minute header, winning 3-2 on aggregate. This was the team&#x27;s first international title since rejoining global football.

Vietnam almost managed a successful 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification, performing well against Syria and Lebanon, as well as against China; but various shortcomings once again proved to be instrumental in denying Vietnam&#x27;s qualification for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, as the team finished third with only a single 3–1 home win (over Lebanon) and two draws away to both Levant opponents Syria and Lebanon. Losing both matches against China, including the huge 6–1 loss in Hangzhou, Vietnam at least had the slight consolation of scoring a single goal in both games.

===Decline (2009–2014)===
The period between 2009 and 2014 marked the decline of Vietnamese football. The team participated in the 2010 and 2014 World Cup qualifiers and 2015 Asian Cup qualifiers, but were unsuccessful, being eliminated at the first hurdle. The team lost 6–0 on aggregate against the United Arab Emirates in the first round of 2010 World Cup qualification. In the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Vietnam could only defeat Macau in the first round before being eliminated by Qatar in the second, while in the 2015 Asian Cup qualifiers, they lost five out of six matches and finished bottom of their group, which included the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Hong Kong. The defeat to Hong Kong at Mong Kok Stadium on 22 March 2013 was considered Vietnam&#x27;s lowest point set in the 21st century.

Vietnam also failed to defend their continental title due to elimination by Malaysia in the 2010 AFF Championship semi-final. The 2012 AFF Championship also saw the team&#x27;s worst performance in 8 years, as they were eliminated in the group stage with their only point coming from a 1–1 draw with Myanmar, while losing 3–1 to Thailand and 1–0 to the Philippines.

===Miura and Hữu Thắng (2014–2017)===
The Vietnamese national team witnessed significant changes under the tenure of Toshiya Miura, who took charge of Vietnam from 2014 to 2016. The Japanese coach was credited for rebuilding the national team after the failed 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification and had a significant impact on the improvement of the team&#x27;s performances. One of the most renowned achievements of Miura&#x27;s regime was with the youth team, which beat Iran at the 2014 Asian Games with an unexpected 4–1 score. Many of the young players nurtured by coach Miura were brought to the senior side, which performanced well in the 2014 AFF Championship. However, Vietnam failed to progress beyond the semi-finals after a shocking 4–2 home defeat to Malaysia, in spite of winning 2–1 away in the first leg. Vietnamese police had sought to investigate this match, but found no evidence of bribery or corruption, as stated in the findings of Swiss-based international supplier betting services Sportradar.

Miura led Vietnam in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in a group with Thailand, Indonesia, Chinese Taipei and Iraq. Indonesia was later banned from participating by FIFA, relieving Vietnam of some pressure. The Golden Star Warriors began their campaign with a 1–1 draw with Iraq at home. However, two disappointing defeats to Thailand, away 1–0 and a humiliating 3–0 home loss, subjected the team to heavy criticism. Despite the sporadic improvement, Toshiya Miura was sacked by the VFF after the Olympic side&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Under Nguyễn Hữu Thắng, Vietnam once again progressed to the semi-finals of the 2016 AFF Championship, but lost to Indonesia in another thrilling semi-final, being held 2–2 at home, having lost 2–1 away. The team&#x27;s disappointment was relieved a little, as the &quot;Golden Star Warriors&quot; finished third in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification World Cup qualification group. The Vietnamese side managed two draws in their opening run against Afghanistan in Tajikistan and a goalless draw to Jordan in Ho Chi Minh City. However, the Olympic side was surprisingly eliminated in the group stage of the 2017 SEA Games, and Nguyễn Hữu Thắng was relieved from duty. The team faced a crisis of confidence as many fans stopped supporting the team. Interim coach Mai Đức Chung was appointed to help Vietnam in two crucial Asian Cup qualification matches against neighbouring Cambodia, in which he was able to replenish some of the team&#x27;s lost spirit, beating Cambodia 2–1 away and giving them a 5–0 thrashing at home. These wins placed Vietnam in the top two for final qualification.

===Park Hang-seo era (2017–2023)===
Park Hang-seo, former assistant to Guus Hiddink for South Korea at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, was appointed as the new coach of the Vietnam national team on 29 September 2017. His appointment came after an attempt to negotiate with Takashi Sekizuka was unsuccessful. Previously, the VFF had tried to contact Steve Sampson, but received no response.

Park&#x27;s first match as coach of Vietnam was in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifications, where Vietnam defeated Cambodia at home 5–0 on 10 October 2017, followed by a 0–0 draw at home against Afghanistan on 14 November 2017. This allowed Vietnam to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, their first Asian Cup since 2007. Park himself, though, was criticized due to the team&#x27;s unconvincing performance. However, the mood rapidly changed after Vietnam youth team&#x27;s impressive showings in the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and 2018 Asian Games where Park Hang-seo was also the coach of the U-23 and Olympic team. With the same U-23 players, he formed the squad of the Vietnamese senior team in a dead-rubber 1–1 draw to Jordan in 2019 Asian Cup qualification, which both teams qualified together.

====2018 AFF Championship====

Park&#x27;s first major tournament was the 2018 AFF Championship. Vietnam topped their group with wins against Laos (3–0), Malaysia (2–0) and Cambodia (3–0), as well as a 0–0 draw with Myanmar. In the semi-finals, they defeated the Philippines and advanced to face Malaysia again. The first leg at Bukit Jalil saw Vietnam lead by two goals, but let the Malayan tigers tie the score through Shahrul Saad and a free kick by Safawi Rasid. Still, an early goal from Nguyễn Anh Đức in the second leg was enough to win them the AFF Championship after 10 years with an unbeaten record. Nguyễn Quang Hải scored four goals and was voted the best player of the tournament.

====2019 AFC Asian Cup====
It wasn&#x27;t until the 2019 AFC Asian Cup that Vietnam truly began to gain international recognition. With the entire squad made up of mostly promising U-23 players, Vietnam had the youngest squad in the tournament. Being drawn into group D along with Iran, Iraq, and Yemen, Vietnam lost to Iraq 2–3 conceding a 90th-minute free kick from Ali Adnan and Iran 0–2 before beating Yemen 2–0 in their final group matches with goals coming from Nguyễn Quang Hải and Quế Ngọc Hải to seal Vietnam to become the last best third-place team qualifying for the round of 16. Then, they pulled up a shocking result by defeating Jordan in a penalty shootout, with Bùi Tiến Dũng scoring the decisive penalties which sent them to the quarter-finals. The win sent millions of Vietnamese into the streets for celebrations. In the quarter-finals, Vietnam played against Japan but failed to continue the success after their opponent was awarded a penalty kick which was decided through the video assistant referee (VAR), resulting in a 0–1 loss score by Ritsu Dōan until the final whistle was blown.

====2022 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Vietnam was grouped in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying Second Round Group G with three other Southeast Asian rivals: Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, along with the United Arab Emirates. The Vietnamese started with a 0–0 away draw over Thailand before defeating Malaysia 1–0 at home and then achieved a 3–1 away win against Indonesia. In November 2019, Vietnam faced the United Arab Emirates on home soil with attempts to break a 12-year winless streak to the opponent. In spite of facing a struggle in the early minutes, a red card to the UAE gave the Vietnamese an advantage. They eventually managed to beat the Emirates 1–0. Then, Vietnam moved to a thrilling encounter against neighbour and fellow powerhouse Thailand at home, where both teams played in another goalless draw, in a match with a crucial Akinfeev-penalty like save by Đặng Văn Lâm and two disallowed Vietnamese goals, to foster Vietnam&#x27;s top position in the Joint World Cup/Asian Cup qualifying Group G.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam was forced to play all their remaining qualifying second-round games in the United Arab Emirates. In this campaign, Vietnam suffered a great loss of key players, as the midfield soul Đỗ Hùng Dũng suffered from a severe injury in 2021 V.League 1 that caused him 6-months of recession, while best goalie Đặng Văn Lâm, due to an unexpected incident related to COVID-19 in his Japanese club Cerezo Osaka, could not come to the national team in Dubai, the key midfielder Nguyễn Tuấn Anh, after suffering an aggressive tackle from an Indonesian player in the 20th minute of the first match, had to miss the rest of the qualifying second round. Nevertheless, even with such a great loss, Vietnam&#x27;s campaign in UAE was an astonishing success. Vietnam pounded Indonesia 4–0 and held on to a 2–1 win against Malaysia. On the last match day, Vietnam battled it out in a thrilling encounter against the hosts, UAE. After trailing 3–0, a late surge in the final 10 minutes brought 2 goals on the scoresheet for Vietnam, but it wasn&#x27;t enough as the match ended 3–2 in favour of UAE. Despite losing however, with Australia defeating Jordan 1–0 in the decisive game of Group B and later Saudi Arabia beating Uzbekistan 3–0 in the decisive game of Group D, Vietnam officially claimed its ticket into the third and final round of the World Cup qualifiers for the first time ever, and automatic qualification to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup in China, after entering as one of the five best runner-ups, the second Southeast Asian nation after Thailand to achieve the feat.

In the third round, Vietnam was drawn into group B along with Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, China, and Oman where Vietnam lost its first seven head-to-head matches. The team played its best in every match, but since the team suffered an injury crisis, which began in mid-August 2021, Vietnam was unable to achieve a single point after the first seven games, and was officially eliminated from the World Cup after a 0–4 loss against Australia in Melbourne Rectangular Stadium on 27 January 2022. However, just five days later, it became the first ever team from Southeast Asia to win a match in the final round of the World Cup qualifiers by beating China 3–1 at home on 1 February 2022, which coincided with the Lunar New Year&#x27;s Day in Vietnam and China. The win was also the first-ever win from a Southeast Asian team ever and also the first-ever win against China in an official competitive match in 65 years, when Indonesia beat China 2–0 in the 1958 FIFA World Cup qualification. The team achieved another historical result in the last qualifying match with a 1–1 draw against host Japan in Saitama Stadium 2002 on 29 March marking the first time ever that Vietnam did not lose against Japan since its reintegration into international football. Nonetheless, Vietnam only earned 4 points in total after 10 matches of the third round (1 win, 1 draw, 8 losses) and finished bottom, losing against all teams in this round but ended up with a historic 3–1 win over China and a draw against Japan in the final match, which was still Vietnam&#x27;s best ever run in World Cup qualification, massively influencing Vietnam&#x27;s image as a potential, emerging footballing nation.

====2022 AFF Championship====
In October 2022, Park Hang-seo announced that he would leave his position as coach at the conclusion of the 2022 AFF Championship. In the tournament, Vietnam topped their group with victories against Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar and a draw against Singapore. Vietnam beat Indonesia in the semi-final but lost 3-2 to Thailand in the final. Coach Park Hang-seo, is considered the most successful coach in Vietnam football history, with FIFA praising Vietnam&#x27;s progress throughout his managerial career with the team. His achievements include the junior team success in the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship as Asian runners-up, the 2018 Asian Games in 4th place, Southeast Asian Games Gold Medal finishes in 2019 and 2021, as well as the senior team in the 2018 AFF Championship as champions, the 2019 AFC Asian Cup as top 8, and Vietnam&#x27;s first time ever qualification to the final and 3rd round of the World Cup Qualifiers for Asia.

===Post Park Hang-seo years and struggles (2023–2025)===

====Philippe Troussier era (2023–2024)====

On 16 February 2023, VFF announced that Frenchman Philippe Troussier, who led South Africa and Japan to the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, had been appointed coach of the Vietnam national team and the under-23s. Troussier was officially presented on 27 February 2023, making him the first World Cup profile manager to lead the country. Troussier signed a contract that last until 31 July 2026, with an ambitious goal of taking Vietnam to the next FIFA World Cup in 2026, where the biggest men’s international football tournament plans to increase the number of participating teams to 48 from 32. Vietnam has never been to the World Cup and the furthest stages were only up to the AFC qualification third round previously under Park Hang-seo.

Before his debut with the national team, Philipe Troussier had led Vietnam’s Olympic side in the 2023 SEA Games in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where Vietnam finished with a bronze medal.

Vietnam started its 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification from the second round of the AFC, drawn in a group with Iraq, Philippines, and Indonesia. Troussier declared during a press conference that he wishes to call up more overseas Vietnamese players into the national teams to strengthen the team for the qualifiers. Later, Czech based Andrej Nguyen and Filip Nguyen were one the first overseas players to get called up under Troussier. In June 2023, Troussier made his debut with the Vietnamese national team with two friendly match wins against Hong Kong and Syria. After a series of six friendlies from 15 June to 17 October 2023 to prepare for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Vietnam ended up with three wins and three losses, including the 0–6 defeat against South Korea which was one of the biggest defeats in Vietnam&#x27;s football history, as well as losses against China and Uzbekistan.

On 16 November 2023, Vietnam began its 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with a 2–0 away game win against the Philippines. A few days later, Vietnam suffered a 0–1 defeat against Iraq on home soil, conceding a goal in the last minute of the game. The first two qualifiers games saw Troussier renewing the team&#x27;s starting lineup with several young players such as Phan Tuấn Tài, Võ Minh Trọng or Nguyễn Thái Sơn.

Vietnam qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup and were grouped with Japan, Iraq, and Indonesia in Group D. At the dawn of the tournament, the team left with many doubts due to the absence of key players like Đặng Văn Lâm, Đoàn Văn Hậu, Quế Ngọc Hải or Nguyễn Tiến Linh due to injuries. The &quot;Golden Star Warriors&quot; were then forced to deal with a talented but inexperienced squad with an average age of 25. New hard blows were then added with the forfeit of Nguyễn Hoàng Đức, 2021 Vietnamese Golden Ball, who also failed to recover from his injury.

Vietnam came to the tournament with a team mostly constituted of players with little experience in international competitions. The team had a positive performance in the opening match, losing 2–4 to title contender Japan and leading 2–1 at one point during the game. However, Vietnam then lost 0–1 to direct competitor Indonesia and was soon eliminated from the group stage, marking their first defeat to Indonesia after 7 years. In the final group stage game against Iraq, Vietnam had a good start while leading 1–0 after the first half, but the team soon fell into a disadvantage position after Khuất Văn Khang was sent off. Iraq quickly led 2–1 before Nguyễn Quang Hải equalized in the 89th minute. In the last minute of the game, Iraq was awarded a penalty and converted it, ending the match as 2–3 lost for Vietnam, forcing them to leave the tournament with 0 points.

Continuing on with 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Vietnam suffered further losses to Indonesia on 21 and 26 March with an aggregate score of 0–4, with the return leg, which ended 0–3, being the first defeat to the Garuda at home in 20 years. Following these performances, the VFF terminated Troussier&#x27;s contract immediately through mutual consent. Under Troussier, Vietnam only won 4 out of 14 matches and suffered 7 defeats in a row.

===Kim Sang-sik era (2024–present)===
Having already failed to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and only setting sights on the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, Kim Sang-sik was announced as Troussier&#x27;s replacement on 3 May 2024. A month later, on 6 June, Kim made his debut as the head coach of Vietnam in the fifth match of Group F of the second round of the World Cup qualifiers, facing Southeast Asian fellow the Philippines and lead Vietnam to a 3–2 victory and thus ended their losing streak. Due to Indonesia&#x27;s 2–0 victory over the Philippines, they finished third in the group, missing out on the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers with a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, and entered the AFC Asian Cup final qualifiers instead. They later lost the final game to group leader Iraq.

====2024 ASEAN Championship====
Vietnam was drawn in Group B with Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Laos. The Vietnam national football team has had an outstanding performance in the 2024 ASEAN Championship, showcasing their talent and dedication throughout the competition. They began their campaign in the group stage with a 4–1 victory over Laos. The team later grabbed a late 1–0 win over Indonesia, a 1–1 draw against Philippines, and finished the phase with a dominant 5–0 win over Myanmar. The team conclded the group stage with a great record of three victories and one tie, allowing them to lead Group B with 10 points. This performance also led in a jump in their FIFA ranking, from the 116th to 114th place.
In the semi-finals, Vietnam met Singapore in a two-game tie. The first leg concluded in a 2–0 victory for Vietnam, with goals from Nguyễn Tiến Linh and Nguyễn Xuân Son. The second leg ended with a score of 3-1 for Vietnam, thereby Vietnam won the right to play in the final with a total score of 5-1 after two matches against Singapore. In the finals, Vietnam met Thailand in a two-game tie. The first leg concluded in a 2–1 victory for Vietnam, with two goals from Nguyễn Xuân Son. The second leg ended with a dramatic 3–2 victory for Vietnam, defeating Thailand with a total score of 5–3 after two matches, and Vietnam won the ASEAN Championship for the third time after more than six years of waiting.

====2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification====
Vietnam was drawn into Group F with two Southeast Asian teams: Malaysia and Laos, along with Nepal.

==Team image==
===Kits===
Vietnam&#x27;s current kit sponsor is Jogarbola. The contract started in January 2024. Vietnam was also previously sponsored by Adidas, Li-Ning, Nike, and Grand Sport. The traditional home colour for the Vietnamese team is all red with yellow trim and the away colour is all white with red trim ever since they started the contract with Nike. With Adidas, it was just red and white. Occasionally, the team wore blue and yellow jerseys.

===Kit suppliers===
===Sponsorship=== 
The team has sponsors including: , Yanmar, Honda, Sony, Sabeco Brewery, Coca-Cola, Vinamilk, Kao, Herbalife Nutrition, Trung Nguyên, Honda, Red Bull, VNPay, FPT Play, and VTVcab.

===Logo===
Unlike many national teams in the world, Vietnam is one of the few football teams to not feature their federation (VFF) logo, or logo that is styled from a national emblem/coat of arms such as Russia, Australia or Poland at their jersey, but rather the national flag. The few other FIFA members to feature the national flag include Palestine, North Korea, Switzerland, and Turkey, and currently is the only team to not feature the logo in Southeast Asia. The logo of VFF is used on the team&#x27;s gear (hats, bags, masks, coats, captain&#x27;s armband in friendly matches...) and in products of multimedia for the team. However, in the 1998 AFF Championship, team Vietnam used the former VFF logo on their jersey officially.

Despite VFF unveiling a logo of a dragon for the national football team in 2017 (similar to the logo of an elephant for Thailand), it was not incorporated onto the national jersey due to negative reception from media and supporters. Furthermore, the dragon logo was intended only for the men&#x27;s national team at first, which would be unreasonable if it was also incorporated into the national jerseys and the uniforms of other teams (women&#x27;s teams, youth teams, futsal teams, beach soccer teams). Afterwards, it was removed.

===Nicknames===
The VFF&#x27;s media outlets officially use the nickname () for the national team, which is derived from the star of the national flag on the team&#x27;s jersey. The local media in Vietnam also refer to the national team as simply &quot;&quot; (The selection). Another nickname, though not frequently used, is ().

===Supporters===
Vietnamese supporters are dubbed to be passionate, having had large celebrations over the team&#x27;s achievements at senior and youth levels.

There are two major supporters&#x27; clubs for the national team, namely &quot;Vietnam Football Supporters&quot; (VFS, ) which was founded in 2014 and &quot;Vietnam Golden Stars&quot; (VGS, ) which was founded in 2017.

When the national team wins important matches, the streets are often overwhelmed by large Vietnamese crowds in an activity known as street storming, which features nationalist chants and the singing of nationalist songs. Vietnamese passionate supporters have been witnessed during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup when the team defeated the UAE 2–0 and later became the lone Southeast Asian side to sneak into the quarter-finals. During the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Vietnamese fans were euphoric in celebration after beating Jordan in the round of 16.

Even in smaller tournaments, Vietnamese fans are also noted for large celebrations, such as when Vietnam won the 2008, and 2018 AFF Championships, and the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship in which their team finished runners-up after losing the final against Uzbekistan.

===Stadiums===
The Vietnamese national team mainly plays at Mỹ Đình National Stadium in Hanoi. Since the start of 2014, Vietnam has played its official home matches in 7 different stadiums with Thống Nhất Stadium, Thiên Trường Stadium, Lạch Tray Stadium and Việt Trì Stadium as secondary stadiums used.
===Rivalries===
====Notable rivalries====
&quot;As of 5 January 2025&quot;

Vietnam has rivalries with some Southeast Asian teams: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore. These rivalries are rooted in geographical proximity.

====Thailand====

Thailand is often considered Vietnam&#x27;s biggest rival in football within the Southeast Asian region. The matches between these two teams are always likened to the &quot;El Clásico&quot; of Southeast Asian football and are followed with much interest in both countries. Vietnam as South Vietnam first faced Thailand in 1956, then the two teams also faced each other at the 1959 Southeast Asian Games and Vietnam won the two matches, in the group stage and the final (Thailand was the host). Despite currently having the better overall record compared with Thailand with 23 wins, 11 draws, and 22 losses after 56 matches, Vietnam has generally poor results against Thailand since its reintegration into international football in 1991. After the match between the two teams in the 2024 LPBank Cup, Vietnam has faced Thailand in 29 matches at the national team level since 1991, winning only 3, drawing 9, and losing 17. Despite this, Vietnam, since reintegration into the world&#x27;s football, is renowned for its performance of &quot;punching above the weight&quot;, often due to its ability to culminate surprise results despite disadvantages, while Thailand has struggled harder to do the same.

Vietnam&#x27;s most memorable win against Thailand was in the final of the 2008 AFF Championship, when a 2–1 win in the first leg in Bangkok set them up for their first-ever title, which they secured after a 1–1 draw in Hanoi.

====Indonesia====

The rivalry stems from the strong competition between Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as the equal strength of the two teams during their matchups. Vietnam and Indonesia have faced each other in 38 matches, with Vietnam having the poorer record with 12 wins, 11 draws, and 16 losses. During the 20-year period from 1999 to 2019, Vietnam only drew and lost against Indonesia in official tournaments beginning after the 1–0 win over Indonesia in 1999 in the semi-finals of the 1999 SEA Games, lasting 12 matches, with seven draws and five losses. Finally, it ended on 15 October 2019 when Vietnam won 3–1 against Indonesia in their third match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification&#x27;s second round in Bali. In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, the two teams confronted in the group stage in a game that ended in a 1–0 victory for Indonesia, which qualify them to the round of 16 while Vietnam got eliminated. In the 2026 World Cup qualification Vietnam have suffered 2 conclusive defeated with Indonesia 0–1 away and 0–3 home, which later knocked Vietnam out of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

====Malaysia====
Similar to Indonesia, Malaysia was considered an equal regional football powerhouse on par with Vietnam. As South Vietnam, the Vietnamese side had a poorer performance, with only three wins, three draws and seven losses, during that time the Malaysians posed as a formidable side in Asia. Since the country&#x27;s reunification, the rivalry continued when the two teams regularly faced off at regional tournaments like the AFF Championship or SEA Games. The matches between the two teams are marked by the tension between the players on the field and between the fans in the stands. Since 1991, Vietnam has overwhelmed in the head-to-head record against Malaysia with 14 wins, three draws, and only six losses. Vietnam has also been maintaining a series of unbeaten matches against Malaysia since 2014.

====Singapore====
While Singapore was still a force in the AFF until 2012, the team was a big rival for Vietnam. They have faced each other in 41 matches, with Vietnam dominating with 23 wins, 13 draws, and 5 losses. However, in the period of just reintegrating with international football in 1991, Vietnam experienced, in the period from 1993 to 1998, a poorer head-to-head record against Singapore; especially when they lost the 1998 AFF Championship final. However, since 1998, Vietnam has been maintaining a series of unbeaten matches against Singapore to this day. Vietnam&#x27;s winning matches in this period against Singapore has never exceeded 1 goal, and 6 out of the 12 matches are draws, although Vietnam did win in the remaining 6. Since Singapore&#x27;s football decline and Vietnam&#x27;s development in the mid-2010s, the matches between two teams also began to lose its importance.

<text>The shilling (; abbreviation: USh; ISO code: UGX) is the currency of Uganda. Officially divided into cents until 2013, due to substantial inflation the shilling now has no subdivision.

==Notation==

Prices in the Ugandan shilling are written in the form of , where x is the amount in shillings, while y is the amount in cents. An equals sign or hyphen represents zero amount. For example, 50 cents is written as &quot; and 100 shillings as &quot; or &quot;100/-&quot;. Sometimes the abbreviation &quot;USh&quot; is prefixed for distinction. If the amount is written using words as well as numerals, only the prefix is used (e.g. USh 10 million).

This pattern was modelled on sterling&#x27;s pre-decimal notation, in which amounts were written in some combination of pounds (£), shillings (s), and pence (d, for denarius). In that notation, amounts under a pound were notated only in shillings and pence.

==History==

The first Ugandan shilling (UGS) replaced the East African shilling in 1966 at par. Following high inflation, a new shilling (UGX) was introduced in 1987 worth 100 old shillings.

The shilling is usually a stable currency and predominates in most financial transactions in Uganda, which has a very efficient foreign exchange market with low spreads. The United States dollar is also widely accepted. Sterling and increasingly the euro are also used.

The Bank of Uganda cut its policy rate to 22% on 1 February 2012 after reduction of inflation for 3 consecutive months.

==Coins==

===First shilling===

In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of , , and and and . The , and coins were struck in bronze, with the higher denominations struck in cupro-nickel. The 2-shilling was only issued that year. In 1972, cupro-nickel 5-shilling coins were issued but were withdrawn from circulation and are now very rare. In 1976, copper-plated steel replaced bronze in the 5- and 10-cent and cupro-nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 50-cent and 1-shilling. In 1986, nickel-plated-steel 50-cent and 1-shilling coins were issued, the last coins of the first shilling.

===Second shilling===

In 1987, copper-plated-steel and and stainless-steel and coins were introduced, with the and curved-equilateral heptagonal in shape. In 1998, coins for, , and were introduced. Denominations currently circulating are , , , , and .

==Banknotes==

===First shilling===

In 1966, the Bank of Uganda introduced notes in denominations of , , and . In 1973, notes were introduced, followed by and in 1983 and in 1985.

===Second shilling===

In 1987, notes were introduced in the new currency in denominations of , , , , and . In 1991, and notes were added, followed by in 1993, in 1995, in 1999, in 2003 and in 2010. Banknotes currently in circulation are 1,000, 2,000, , , and . In 2005, the Bank of Uganda was considering whether to replace the low-value notes such as the with coins. The lower denomination notes take a battering in daily use, often being very dirty and sometimes disintegrating.

On 17 May 2010, the Bank of Uganda issued a new family of notes featuring a harmonised banknote design that depict Uganda&#x27;s rich historical, natural, and cultural heritage. They also bear improved security features. Five images appear on all the six denominations: Ugandan mat patterns, Ugandan basketry, the map of Uganda (complete with the equator line), the Independence Monument, and a profile of a man wearing Karimojong headdress. Bank of Uganda Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile said the new notes did not constitute a currency reform, nor were they dictated by politics. The redesign, he said, was driven by the need to comply with international practices and to beat counterfeiters. Uganda is the first African country to introduce the advanced security feature SPARK on a regular banknote series. SPARK is an optical security feature recognised by central banks worldwide and is used on a number of banknotes for protection against counterfeiting.

=== Current notes ===
As of April 2023, these are the Ugandan shilling banknotes in circulation:
* 50,000/= yellow 
* red
* purple
* green
* blue
* brown

<text>The Public (&quot;El público&quot;), also known as The Audience, is a play by the twentieth-century Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written between 1929 and 1930. The two complete manuscripts which once existed have not been found, and may be lost. All that is known is an earlier draft, missing an act. It remained unpublished until 1978 and did not receive its first professional theatrical production until 1986. The world premiere of the play was directed by Victoria Espinosa on 15 February 1978 at the University of Puerto Rico.

==Production history==
&quot;The Public&quot; was first presented at the University of Puerto Rico on 15 February 1978, where it was directed by Victoria Espinosa. Her staging included surrealistic paintings. A translated version by Henry Livings (in consultation with the director/designer, Ultz) was first performed on 3 October 1988 at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. The U.S. premiere opened at the Shepard Theatre Complex in Los Angeles, California, on February 23, 1989, and was presented by Kaliyuga Arts. The production was directed and designed by John Sowle, with costumes by Silvia Jahnsons and incidental music composed by Jules Langert, and featured Robert J. Bennett, Denise Y. Dowse, Roger Gutierrez, Alex Katehakis, Kevin Kirby, Khin-Kyaw Maung, Richard Neil, Steven Patterson, Jane Thurow, Richard Vidan, Courtney Walsh and B. Wyatt in the cast.

Mauricio Sotelo composed an opera based on the play: &quot;The Public&quot; premiered in 2015 at the Teatro Real in Madrid, Spain.

<doc id="1145566" wikidata="Q3764964" url="?curid=1145566" title="Kolleru Lake">
<text>Kolleru Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes in India and forms the largest shallow freshwater lake in Asia (with 245 km2 of lake area and 302 km2 of total Ramsar designated wetland). 15 kilometers away from Eluru and 65 km from Rajamahendravaram, the lake is located between the Krishna and Godavari river deltas. Kolleru Lake is located in the Eluru district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The lake is fed directly by water from the seasonal Budameru and Tammileru rivulets, and is connected to the Krishna and Godavari irrigation systems by over 67 major and minor irrigation canals. This lake is a major tourist attraction. Many birds migrate here in winter, such as Siberian crane, ibis, and painted storks. The lake was an important habitat for an estimated 20 million resident and migratory birds, including the grey or spot-billed pelican (&quot;Pelecanus philippensis&quot;). The lake was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in November 1999 under India&#x27;s Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and designated a wetland of international importance in November 2002 under the international Ramsar Convention. The wildlife sanctuary covers an area of 308 km2.
Kolleru Lake under Ramsar Convention (allowing local communities (Here: Vaddi Community) to continue their occupation of culture fish and caught fish) covers and Kolleru Lake under Wildlife Sanctuary covers .

== Current state of the lake ==

Thousands of fish tanks were erected, effectively converting the lake into a mere drain. This has a great impact in terms of pollution, leading to difficulty in getting drinking water for the local people. This is in addition to the loss of ecological diversity and intrusion of sea water into the land masses and its fallout in terms of adverse influence on the rainfall pattern in this region. Due to the promulgation of bunds of illegal fish tanks blocking water flow, there has been a cessation of water drainage into the sea, causing excessive flooding and subsequent adverse effects on the thousands of acres of crops in the upper reaches of the sanctuary.

This pollution is caused by numerous factories built along the lake that discharge waste products into the lake, whose water is used for food production. In 2006, the Andhra Pradesh government executed &quot;Operation Kolleru&quot;, an effort to clean up the lake, in the past, with middling success, and has now declared &quot;Operation Kolleru-2.0&quot;.

Satellite images taken on 9 February 2001 by the Indian remote sensing satellite found that approximately 42% of the 245 km2 lake was occupied by aquaculture, while agriculture had encroached upon another 8.5%. The area under aquaculture consisted of 1,050 fish ponds within the lake and 38 dried-up fish ponds, which together covered an area of 103 km2. The aquaculture fishermen fire gunshots to prevent birds from feeding on the fish. The agricultural encroachments were mostly rice paddies. Surprisingly, no clear water could be found in the satellite image. The rest of the lake is diminished by water diversion or is infested with weeds like elephant grass and the water hyacinth.

Rich in flora and fauna, the lake had always attracted migratory birds from Northern Asia and Eastern Europe, between the months of October and March. During this season, the lake used to be visited by an estimated two million birds.

The resident birds include:
* grey pelicans,
* Asian open-bill (&quot;Anastomus oscitans&quot;),
* painted storks (&quot;Mycteria leucocephala&quot;),
* glossy ibises and
* white ibises.

The migratory birds include:
* red-crested pochards,
* black-winged stilts,
* pied avocets,
* common redshanks,
* Eurasian wigeons,
* gadwalls,
* great cormorants,
* garganeys,
* purple herons,
* greater flamingos,
* green-winged teals,
* northern pintails and
* northern shovelers.

Kolleru lake contains numerous fertile islets called lankas; many of the small ones are submerged during floods. The origin of the unusual depression which forms the bed of the lake is unknown, but it was possibly the result of an earthquake. Therefore, many ancient villages are precepted in the bed of the lake as a result of floods and earthquake. building the industries and factories near the lake that why the lake is polluting and the government also declared the operation kolleru.

== History ==
Two copper plates have been found in the lake, tracing its history to reign of the Eastern Ganga rulers, the Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Odisha at the height of their power in the 15th century under the reign of Kapilendra Deva, the first Suryavamsi Gajapati emperor, and the boundary of the Kalinga empire (Ancient Odisha). Nearby in Kolletikota is the Peddintlamma Temple, built by Eastern Ganga monarchs.

<text>Roosevelt Field is a former airport, located in Westbury, Long Island, New York. Originally called the Hempstead Plains Aerodrome, or sometimes Hempstead Plains field or the Garden City Aerodrome, it was a training field (Hazelhurst Field) for the Air Service, United States Army during World War I.

In 1919, it was renamed in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s son, Quentin, who was killed in air combat during World War I.

Roosevelt Field was the takeoff point for many historic flights in the early history of aviation, including Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s 1927 solo transatlantic flight. It was also used by other pioneering aviators, including Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post.

==History==
The Hempstead Plains Aerodrome originally encompassed east of and abutting Clinton Road, south of and adjacent to Old Country Road, and west of Merrick Avenue. A bluff 15 feet in elevation divided the plain into two large fields. The U.S. Army Signal Corps established the Signal Corps Aviation Station, Mineola, on the west field in July 1916, as a pilot training school for members of the National Guard.

===World War I===
When the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the entire field was taken over and renamed Hazelhurst Field after Leighton Wilson Hazelhurst Jr. Hazelhurst was a native of Georgia and was a graduate of the United States Military Academy. He reported for aeronautical duty at the Signal Corps Aviation School, Augusta, Georgia, on 2 March 1912. On 11 June 1912, while making a flight at College Park, Maryland, as a passenger in an airplane undergoing acceptance tests, the plane crashed to the ground and both the pilot and Lt. Hazelhurst were killed.

An adjacent tract of land south of the Hempstead branch line of the Long Island Rail Road was acquired for expansion, becoming Camp Mills along Clinton Road and Hazelhurst Aviation Field No. 2 to the east, part of the massive Air Service Aviation Concentration Center. Hazelhurst Field No. 2 was renamed Mitchel Field on July 16, 1918, to commemorate John Purroy Mitchel, the former mayor of New York killed in a flying accident on July 6, 1918, while training with the U.S. Air Service in Louisiana. On September 24, 1918, the Army dedicated the eastern portion of Hazelhurst Field No. 1 as Roosevelt Field.

Air Service units that assigned to Hazelhurst Field were:

;; Permanently assigned
* 46th Aero Squadron (II), July 1918-January 1919
* 52d Aero Squadron (II), July–November 1918

;; Assigned to Aviation Concentration Center for deployment to AEF

;; First Atlantic crossing by air in both directions

On the morning of 5 July 1919, the British R34 (airship) landed after having crossed the Atlantic as the first aircraft to cross in the east–west direction. It later returned to Britain, being the first aircraft to complete an Atlantic crossing in both directions.

After the armistice, the Air Service authorized several companies to operate from the fields but maintained control until July 1, 1920, at which time the government sold its buildings and improvements and relinquished control of the property.

===Civil use===
Once in civilian hands, the owners sold portions along the southern edge of the field and split the remainder of the property into two separate areas. Curtiss Field, a airport on the original site of Hazelhurst Field, occupied half of the western portion along Clinton Road. Roosevelt Field occupied the remainder, consisting of seven hangars and a large parking ramp adjacent to Curtiss Field, and an east–west packed clay runway in length on the bluff. The area between Curtiss Field and the Long Island Motor Parkway, which ran north of and parallel to Stewart Avenue, became the Old Westbury Golf Course, while the area to the east of the golf course was used as the Meadow Brook Polo Field. Both areas are now completely developed.

In pursuit of the Orteig Prize, René Fonck attempted to take off in the Sikorsky S-35 from Roosevelt Field&#x27;s long runway on September 21, 1926, but the aircraft was severely overweight and stressed the auxiliary landing gear mounted to help support the load, losing a wheel. Unable to gain lift speed, the plane cartwheeled off the end of the bluff and burst into flames, killing two of its crew. The following May, operating from a hangar at Curtiss Field, Charles Lindbergh used the Roosevelt Field runway for the takeoff of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; on his flight to Paris.

Both fields were bought in 1929 by Roosevelt Field, Inc. The western field, called &quot;Unit 2&quot;, and the runway atop the bluff, called &quot;Unit 1&quot;, were connected by a broad earthen taxi ramp and the consolidated property was named Roosevelt Field. Unit 1 was sold in 1936 and became the Roosevelt Raceway, while Unit 2 continued to operate as an aviation center under the name Roosevelt Field. At its peak in the 1930s, it was America&#x27;s busiest civilian airfield.

===Closure===
Roosevelt Field was used by the Navy and Army during World War II. After the war, Roosevelt Field reverted to operation as a commercial airport until it was acquired by real estate developers in 1950. The field closed on May 31, 1951.

The eastern field first became an industrial park but is now largely retail shopping, including the Mall at The Source on the site of the former runway, and townhouses, while the site of the original flying field in 1911–1916 has become a shopping mall.

==Fresco==
Aline Rhonie Hofheimer (1909–1963), painted a 126-foot fresco representing aviation history in Roosevelt Field, Long Island. It has since been relocated to the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens, NY.
==Mall==

Manhattan-based real estate company Webb and Knapp gained a controlling interest in the airfield in 1950 and later built light factories on the former Unit 2. Currently its site is occupied by Roosevelt Field Mall and Garden City Plaza.

==In popular culture==
* Arthur J. Burks, &quot;Haunted Hangars&quot; (two-part serial), &quot;Flyers&quot;, January &amp; February 1930. Referred to as &quot;Mineola field&quot;.
* In James Thurber&#x27;s short story &quot;The Greatest Man in the World&quot;, Jack &quot;Pal&quot; Smurch, a two bit hooligan turned national hero, both departs from and returns to Roosevelt Field on his historic round-the-world flight.

<text>Hypostomus punctatus, the suckermouthed catfish, is a tropical fish belonging to the armored suckermouth catfish family, Loricariidae. &quot;Hypostomus punctatus&quot; is a freshwater fish native to South America, in the coastal drainages of southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. It is one of a number of species commonly referred to as &quot;plecostomus&quot; or &quot;common pleco&quot; by aquarists.

==Description==
&quot;H. punctatus&quot; is a species of loricariid catfish. Like other members of this family, it possesses a suckermouth, armor plates, strong dorsal and pectoral fin spines, and the omega iris. This species reaches about TL.

&quot;Hypostomus punctatus&quot; is difficult to distinguish from closely related species, such as &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot;. Identification is relatively difficult as there are many different similar species labelled as &quot;common pleco&quot;. This species has a light brown coloration with a pattern of darker brown spots (its specific epithet, &quot;punctatus&quot;, means &quot;spotted&quot;). Because of this, the species may also be known as the spotted hypostomus. The species is not notably striped and is generally lighter in coloration than &quot;H. plecostomus&quot;.

==Habitat and ecology==
&quot;H. punctatus&quot; is found in the wild in fast-flowing rivers as well as in flooded areas. It prefers water with a temperature of , a pH range of 5–8, and a dH range of 0.5–25. &quot;H. punctatus&quot; is primarily herbivorous and feeds on algae and detritus as well as plants and roots.

<text>Group C of [[UEFA Euro 2004]] was one of four groups in the final tournament&#x27;s initial group stage. It began on 14 June and was completed on 22 June. The group consisted of Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Bulgaria.

Sweden won the group and advanced to the quarter-finals, along with Denmark. Italy and Bulgaria failed to advance.

Three teams – Italy, Denmark and Sweden – all finished with five points, with each team having defeated Bulgaria but drawn their two other games. As all results between the three teams in question were draws, both the points won in these games and the goal difference accrued in these games still left the teams undivided. The decisive tiebreaker was therefore the goals scored during the games between one another: Italy having scored the fewest goals of the three teams were therefore eliminated.

This became so with a 2–2 result between Denmark and Sweden in the last group game, a result that Italy knew would eliminate them and one that representatives of both teams denied would happen in advance of the game, Sweden co-coach Lars Lagerbäck quoted as saying in response to Italian questions on the likelihood of this score occurring: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it will end 2–2 — that is a very unusual result&quot;.

<text>Sir Ralph Freeman (27 November 1880 – 11 March 1950) was an English structural engineer, responsible for the design of several of the world&#x27;s most impressive bridges.

Born in London, England, he studied at The Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School and the City and Guilds of London Institute, and in 1901 joined Douglas Fox &amp; Partners, a firm of consulting engineers specialising in the design of steel bridges. He rose to become senior partner and in 1938 the firm changed its name to Freeman Fox &amp; Partners.

Sir Ralph is best remembered for his design work on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Birchenough Bridge in the Chipinge area of Zimbabwe.

His son, also called Ralph Freeman, was also an engineer, senior partner at Freeman Fox &amp; Partners, and president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He had been responsible for the design of the Humber Suspension Bridge. His grandson, Ralph Anthony Freeman, was also an engineer who worked on numerous bridges including The RAMA IX Bridge in Bangkok.

<text>Hans Brask (1464–1538) was a Swedish Bishop of Linköping.

==Biography==

Brask was born in Linköping in 1464 to a bourgeois family. He studied philosophy and law at German universities, e.g. Rostock, and around 1500 he received a doctoral degree in civil and canon law from Rome. Upon his return to Sweden he first worked as canon and was later, in 1505, appointed cathedral dean in the cathedral of Linköping. He also became a member of the council of the realm (Privy Council of Sweden) and worked for a reconciliation with Denmark, with which Sweden has been at war for some years as part of the ongoing conflicts in the Kalmar Union. In 1513 he was appointed bishop in Linköping. Brask was opposed to Sten Sture&#x27;s struggle with archbishop Gustav Trolle, but signed a document at the 1517 diet to remove the bishop. According to Olaus Petri&#x27;s Swedish chronicles, Brask was forced to sign the document. Under his seal he is supposed to have put a note saying &quot;&quot; - &quot;To this I am forced and compelled&quot;.

This legend hass birthed the term in modern Swedish of (&quot;Brask note&quot;), meaning a hidden or oblique reservation to an otherwise spotless or obsequious acceptance. The word can by extension have several other meanings, including &quot;explanation&quot;, &quot;excuse&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, &quot;parenthesis&quot;, or &quot;question mark&quot;. It is unrelated to , which is onomatopoeic and roughly means &quot;to bang&quot; or &quot;to rustle&quot;. Upon the fall of Stockholm and the Kalmar Union&#x27;s restoration in 1520, Brask was - according to legend - allowed to leave and thus escaped the Stockholm Bloodbath by virtue of the note.

In fact Brask supported the Danish king Christian II, but was not part of the events that led to the infamous massacre in Stockholm 1520. After Gustav Vasa&#x27;s rebellion, he was forced to join the new king&#x27;s side, but he would become an opponent of the king&#x27;s politics. The events of 1527 diet in Västerås led to Brask fleeing the country to Poland.

Brask was an active man with many ideas. He was the first man to plan a canal between the two large Swedish lakes, Vänern and Vättern. He was running a printing house in Söderköping. The correspondence between Brask and others is an important source of history in a country where not much was written down.

Bishop Brask is believed to have died in Ląd (Swedish &quot;Landa&quot;) monastery (the Cistercian Trail, Poland) in 1538, where his tombstone is seen to this day.

<doc id="1145619" wikidata="Q7932435" url="?curid=1145619" title="Vineland, Florida">
<text>Vineland is an unincorporated community in southwest Orange County, Florida, United States, located just north of Interstate 4 along State Road 535 and continues along County Road 435, which is South Apopka Vineland Road. The name is no longer often used since the more well-known City of Lake Buena Vista lies just to the south and west. Orange County officially calls the area Buena Vista North or Orange Center, its original name. Mailing addresses for residents in the area are typically Orlando, Florida except many businesses in the area use Lake Buena Vista as their address. The area is most famous due to the name appearing on many major Orange County roads, including Apopka-Vineland Road, Winter Garden-Vineland Road, Kissimmee-Vineland Road and Taft-Vineland Road. There was also a small town which was abandoned in the 1960s called Vineland. An ACL Railway Depot, Housing, a schoolhouse, a church, the Vineland Cemetery, and many more community facilities were a part of the original town. These roads begin/terminate in the area known as Vineland and Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

Vineland is mainly residential, with a mosque Jama Masjid of Orlando, a synagogue, Southwest Orlando Jewish and four shopping center areas with 15 plus restaurants and several hotels and time share resorts, and the eastern entrance to Walt Disney World on Hotel Plaza Blvd. being other land uses. There are about 50 houses in the neighborhood, apartment complex, Mobile Home park (55 yr,+). It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The area was given the name Orange Center when it was platted in 1911. Previously it had the name Englewood, probably given to it by the Florida Midland Railroad. The name was changed to Vineland in 1924, supposedly due to confusion with Orange City, Florida. A Post Office opened at Orange Center in 1912, and was renamed Vineland in 1918. The Vineland Post Office closed in 1940.

In the 2000s and 2010s, many of the remnants of the Abandoned Town, including houses, buildings, and roads began being demolished and replaced with Hotels, Shopping Plazas, and other Businesses.

As of 2022, a few houses remain, some being abandoned, along with a small Confederate Cemetery, the original Schoolhouse (Now part of a Montessori School), and fragments of the original roads.

<text>The knockout stage of [[UEFA Euro 2004]] was a single-elimination tournament involving the eight teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions. The knockout stage began with the quarter-finals on 24 June and ended with the final on 4 July 2004 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Greece won the tournament with a 1–0 victory over the host nation Portugal.

&quot;All times Western European Summer Time (UTC+1)&quot;

==Format==
Any game in the knockout stage that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves). For the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team who leads the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner. If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated there would be a penalty shoot-out (five penalties each, unless one team gained an unassailable lead, but more if scores were level after the initial five) to determine who progressed to the next round. As with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.

==Qualified teams==
The top two placed teams from each of the four groups qualified for the knockout stage.

<text>The Flight Regiment 19 (, or ), also known as the Swedish Voluntary Air Force or F 19 was a Finnish Air Force unit, manned by Swedish volunteers, which operated from Kemi in northern Finland for the last 62 days of the Winter War. The aircraft also came from the Swedish Air Force inventory. Its designation number was taken from the Swedish Air Force which had 18 flying regiments at the time. The designation F 19 has not been used in Sweden. When new regiments were later formed they were named F 20, F 21 and F 22.

The unit made a significant contribution to the defense of Finnish Lapland, from January 7, 1940, with 12 Gloster Gladiator II fighters, five Hawker Hart bombers, and eight other planes. In total, the unit destroyed twelve Soviet aircraft (eight in the air, four on the ground), and lost a total of six planes; two to enemy action and four to accidents. Three of its pilots were killed and two more were captured by Soviet forces. The captives were returned to Sweden five months after the end of the war.

==Organization==

<doc id="1145634" wikidata="Q2495828" url="?curid=1145634" title="University of Arkansas–Fort Smith">
<text>The University of Arkansas–Fort Smith (UAFS) is a public university in Fort Smith, Arkansas, United States. Part of the University of Arkansas System, UAFS is the sixth-largest university in Arkansas with a fall 2020 enrollment of approximately 6,500 students.

The university campus occupies of an arboretum that has 1,182 GPS-inventoried trees representing 81 species. It offers 62 graduate, bachelor, and associate degree programs and 50 technical and proficiency certificates.

UAFS&#x27;s athletic teams, the Lady Lions and Lions, compete in NCAA Division II as members of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association with five women&#x27;s teams and five men&#x27;s teams across ten sports.

== History ==
The University of Arkansas–Fort Smith was established in 1928 as an extension of the public school system in Fort Smith, Arkansas, with the superintendent, James William Ramsey, acting as the college president and the high school principal as dean. Known originally as Fort Smith Junior College, the institution operated within the Fort Smith public school system until 1950, when the school was incorporated as a private, nonprofit institution with its own governing board. In September 1952, the college moved from borrowed facilities in the high school to its current site, initially occupying .

A vocational-technical division was added in 1960. During this period, the college began developing the programs and character of a comprehensive community college—a new concept in Arkansas and across the nation.

In the fall of 1965, the Sebastian County electorate approved the creation of the Sebastian County Community Junior College District, along with a tax levy on the real and personal property of the county. The governor appointed a Board of Trustees, and the school again became a public institution.

In 1966, the institution&#x27;s name was changed from Fort Smith Junior College to Westark Junior College, and in 1972, to Westark Community College, indicating the larger area to be served and reflecting the more comprehensive mission.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the college developed and made changes within the context of its mission as a two-year institution. A significant development in 1989 was the establishment of a University Center. Five state universities partnered with the institution to offer six bachelor&#x27;s and seven master&#x27;s degree programs on campus. Between 1989 and 2002, 1,788 students graduated with bachelor&#x27;s degrees through the University Center.

In 1997, the Arkansas Legislature passed an act granting Westark the authority to offer in its own right up to nine applied bachelor&#x27;s degrees, developed in response to identified needs of the industries in the area served.

The name of the college was changed yet again in February 1998 to Westark College. On December 15, 2000, the Board of Trustees of Westark College entered into an agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas to merge with the University of Arkansas System as a four-year institution. In 2001, the Sebastian County electorate voted to support the merger. A formal request to change affiliation status to that of a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution under the name of the University of Arkansas–Fort Smith was submitted to the Higher Learning Commission in August 2001 and approved by the Institutional Actions Council on November 19, 2001.

The merger, which became official on January 1, 2002, endorsed the concept of UAFS as a unique university, one that offers applied and traditional baccalaureate degree programs, one- and two-year associate and technical programs, and non-credit business and industry training programs.

== Colleges ==
In April 2021, UAFS Chancellor Terisa Riley announced a reorganization of the university&#x27;s structure which consolidated its colleges from five to three. The three colleges are:

<doc id="1145637" wikidata="Q2420440" url="?curid=1145637" title="100th meridian west">
<text>The meridian 100° west of the Prime Meridian of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, North America, the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole. The 100th meridian west forms a great circle with the 80th meridian east.

In the United States, this meridian roughly marks the boundary between the semi-arid climate in the west and the humid continental and humid subtropical climates in the east and is used as shorthand to refer to that arid-humid boundary.

The meridian coincides with the approximate center of the continental United States, and is featured prominently on the cover of the Charter of the United Nations.

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the North Pole and heading south to the South Pole, the 100th meridian west passes through:

==United States==


In the United States the meridian 100° west of Greenwich forms the eastern border of the Texas panhandle with Oklahoma (which traces its origin to the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819 which settled the border between New Spain and the United States between the Red River and Arkansas River). Dodge City, Kansas lies exactly at the intersection of the Arkansas River and the 100th meridian.

As first noted by John Wesley Powell in the 1870s, there is a big difference in rainfall by the different sides of the meridian. In the central Great Plains, it roughly marks the western boundary of the normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and the approximate boundary (although some areas do push the boundary slightly farther east) between the semi-arid climate to the west and the humid continental (north of about 37°N) and humid subtropical (south of about 37°N) climates to the east. West of the meridian, raising livestock is much more economically important than east of it, and what agriculture does exist relies heavily on irrigation. Historically, the meridian has often been taken as a rough boundary between the eastern and western United States. White settlement, spreading westward after the American Civil War, settled the area around this meridian during the 1870s.

A sign across U.S. Highway 30 in Cozad, Nebraska, marks the place where the 100th meridian intersects with the routes of the Oregon Trail, Pony Express, transcontinental railroad, and the Lincoln Highway.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot; by The Tragically Hip is about the 100th meridian west, specifically in Canada, and how it has traditionally been considered &quot;where the Great Plains begin.&quot;

<doc id="1145640" wikidata="Q800012" url="?curid=1145640" title="Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)">
<text>Robert Norman &quot;Badger Bob&quot; Johnson (March 4, 1931 – November 26, 1991) was an American college, international, and professional ice hockey coach. He coached the Wisconsin Badgers men&#x27;s ice hockey team from 1966 to 1982, where he led the Badgers to seven appearances at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championships, including three titles. During his time as the head coach at Wisconsin, Johnson also coached the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 1976 Winter Olympics and seven other major championships, including the Canada Cup and IIHF World Championships. He then coached the Calgary Flames for five seasons that included a Stanley Cup Finals loss in 1986. Johnson achieved the peak of his professional coaching career in his only season as coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1990–91, when the Penguins won the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, becoming the second American-born coach to win it and the first in 53 years. In August 1991, following hospitalization due to a brain aneurysm, Johnson was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died on November 26 of the same year.

Johnson was well known amongst players and fans for his enthusiasm and unflappable optimism, immortalized through his famous catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s a great day for hockey!&quot;

== Youth and amateur coaching career ==
Johnson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended Minneapolis Central High School and the University of Minnesota, where he played hockey under legendary coach John Mariucci.

In 1956, he and Ken Johannson were hired by Warroad High School in northwestern Minnesota as teachers and coaches of the boys&#x27; hockey team. They had previously been roommates at the University of North Dakota, and neither knew the other was hired to run the team. He later coached hockey at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis. He would teach his history class using a hockey stick as a pointer to the chalkboard. Johnson became the head hockey coach at Colorado College in 1963.

In 1966, Johnson moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was head coach until 1982. He led the Badgers to seven NCAA tournaments, winning three championships in 1973, 1977, and 1981. It was at Wisconsin where Johnson earned the nickname, &quot;Badger Bob.&quot;

Johnson also coached the 1976 Winter Olympic hockey team, the 1981, 1984, and 1987 U.S. teams in the Canada Cup tournament, and the 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1981 U.S. national teams.

== NHL coaching career ==
In 1982, Johnson began his National Hockey League career when he became the head coach of the Calgary Flames, a position he held for five seasons. In the 1985–86 season, he coached the Flames to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost 4 games to 1 to the Montreal Canadiens. From 1987 until 1990, he served as the President of USA Hockey. Then in 1990, he was named the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins. In his first season, he coached the team, which was led by superstar Mario Lemieux, to a 1991 Stanley Cup Finals championship victory over the Minnesota North Stars, four games to two. That would be his only season coaching the Penguins.

=== Brain cancer and death===
In August 1991, as he was preparing the U.S. team for the upcoming Canada Cup tournament, Johnson suffered a brain aneurysm and was hospitalized, where he was diagnosed with brain cancer. He was then flown on a private plane to Colorado with Dr. Dan Thompson of Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. He began treatment and turned the day-to-day supervision of the Penguins over to his three assistant coaches and Scotty Bowman, the team&#x27;s director of player development and recruitment, who was named interim head coach. Though the team was &quot;coached by committee&quot;, Johnson continued to oversee them from his hospital room by way of videotape and remained in contact by fax machine.

On November 26, 1991, Johnson died of brain cancer in Colorado Springs, Colorado. After his death, his catchphrase was emblazoned on a banner hanging over the ice at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was painted at the bluelines on the ice in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Civic Arena. In memoriam, it remained on the ice there for the remainder of the season. In addition, Penguins players would wear a patch on the left sleeve of their jerseys with the word &quot;BADGER&quot; under his birth and death years. Pittsburgh also put his name on the Stanley Cup a second time after their second straight Cup victory in . &quot;He&#x27;s such a tremendous person...We would like to win it again for him,&quot; said Mark Recchi, a member of the team in 1991.

At the team&#x27;s 1992 victory celebration at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Bowman&#x27;s first remark was that &quot;the coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins will always be – Bob Johnson&quot;.

The team used &quot;A Great Day For Hockey&quot; as their marketing slogan for the 2008–09 season. On June 12, 2009, exactly 19 years to the day of Johnson&#x27;s hiring, the Pittsburgh Penguins won their third Stanley Cup. Furthermore, the Penguins won their fourth Stanley Cup, 26 years to the day that Johnson was hired, on June 12, 2016. &quot;A Great Day For Hockey&quot; now adorns the entrance of the PPG Paints Arena, the current home arena of the Penguins.

At the time of his death Johnson&#x27;s 234 NHL victories were a record for an American born coach. Dan Bylsma, John Tortorella, Peter Laviolette and Mike Sullivan have since eclipsed this mark.

Johnson was inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987, United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. On November 2, 2012, the Wisconsin Badgers Men&#x27;s Hockey team dedicated their home ice rink to Johnson, dubbing it &quot;Bob Johnson Rink&quot;.

==Personal life==
Johnson is also the father of 1980 Olympic hockey gold medalist and current Wisconsin women&#x27;s hockey coach Mark Johnson and former Wisconsin assistant coach and Toronto Maple Leafs scout Peter Johnson. He is the grandfather of former Wisconsin hockey player Patrick Johnson, former Denver Pioneer hockey player Scott McConnell, Augsburg College men&#x27;s assistant hockey coach Chris Johnson, women&#x27;s hockey player Mikayla Johnson, and women&#x27;s soccer player Meghan Johnson.

Johnson umpired baseball games in Minnesota with fellow hockey coach Dave Peterson.

<doc id="1145645" wikidata="Q7057158" url="?curid=1145645" title="North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways">
<text>The North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (NWNGR) was a railway company that planned to build a number of inter-connected narrow-gauge railways across North Wales. The first two of these lines – jointly known as the &quot;Moel Tryfan Undertaking&quot; – were authorised by act of Parliament, the  (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. clxxv) and were built and opened in the 1870s. The original main line ran from Dinas Junction to Bryngwyn and opened in 1877. The second line was a branch from Tryfan Junction to South Snowdon, though shortly after opening, the company designated the Tryfan Junction to Bryngwyn section as the branch, and the Dinas Junction to South Snowdon section as the main line.

==Routes built==

The company completed construction of two lines, The first, opened in 1877, was approximately long, running south-east from a junction with the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Caernarfon to Afon Wen branch at , to . There were intermediate stations at and . From Bryngwyn, a shallow incline climbed the northern flank of Moel Tryfan. From the top of the incline a number of quarry tramways connected to the Alexandra quarry, Moel Tryfan quarry, Fron quarry, Braich quarry and Cilgwyn quarry.

The second line was opened in stages, and completed in 1881. It connected to , a distance of about . There were intermediate stations at , and . The line from Dinas Junction to South Snowdon was considered the main line from about 1878, with the Tryfan Junction to Bryngwyn section as the branch. South Snowdon station was later renamed Rhyd Ddu.

==Routes planned==

The line from Dinas Junction to Rhyd Ddu was built, with a short branch from Tryfan Junction to Bryngwyn, and operated, but this was just a small part of the grand scheme for a network of narrow-gauge railways spanning much of northern Wales. The North Wales Narrow Gauge Railway was intended to run from Caernarvon via Beddgelert to Portmadoc (where it would link with the Festiniog), with a second and very long line from Beddgelert to Bettws-y-Coed and across a long stretch of open country to Corwen, totaling some 60 miles had these lines been built. All lines were specified to be of a gauge between 2 ft. and 2 ft. 9 in., though the railways proposed were not all connected. The master plan to link almost all the larger places in north-west Wales by narrow-gauge railway included the following proposed lines:

# To extend from a Junction with the Portmadoc, Croesor &amp; Beddgelert Tram Railway Company&#x27;s proposed line to Beddgelert, thence to Pen-y-gwryd via Nant Gwynant involving reversing spirals of 2 chains radius. Thence to Capel Curig and Bettws-y-Coed.
# From Bettws-y-Coed, following alongside the route of Holyhead-London road to a point three miles west of Corwen.
# From end of Railway No. 2 into Corwen, terminating behind the standard gauge railway station of the Great Western Railway.
An act of Parliament, the (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. cxxxiv) authorised an extension northwards to Caernarfon and a Light Railway Order of 1900 authorised an extension southwards to Beddgelert.

A further part of the scheme was the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (General Undertaking) which planned a route from Porthmadog to Beddgelert, where it would meet the Rhyd Ddu-Beddgelert extension. From there the line would travel via Capel Curig to Betws-y-Coed. A further branch would have extended the line from Betws-y-Coed to Corwen via Cerrig-y-Drudion where the railway would meet the planned Ruthin and Cerrig-y-Drudion Railway.

A short, separate line from Pwllheli (adjacent to the Cambrian Railways&#x27; terminus of that period) to Porthdinllaen was also proposed.

The General Undertaking was authorised by the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways Act 1872 but officially abandoned in 1876. The section from Porthmadog to Beddgelert was eventually completed by the Welsh Highland Railway as part of its construction, and utilised parts of the Croesor Tramway and the aborted Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PBSSR) works.

== South Snowdon ==

There are two locations which have been called South Snowdon. One is Rhyd Ddu and the other is the South Snowdon Quarry in the Nant Gwynant Pass and this was the original intended destination of the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway. That company later applied for and received a light railway order to build from Beddgelert to Rhyd Ddu and commenced construction on that section around 1906. All the known photographs of the station at Rhyd Ddu taken prior to 1914 show a station nameboard SNOWDON.

==History==
The company was formed in 1871, and authorised by the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways Act 1872, to build &quot;certain railways in the counties of Carnarvon and Merioneth&quot; and to raise £216,000 in capital. In 1871, the company appointed Charles Easton Spooner, as their chief engineer. Spooner was then the manager of the Festiniog Railway and had been instrumental in the design of their steam locomotives in the 1860s.
By 1876, £66,000 had been raised in capital, the whole amount authorised to pay for the &quot;Moeltryfan Undertaking&quot;, but the company needed further capital and applied to Parliament for a second act of Parliament, the (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. cxxv) in April that year. This second act allowed the company to abandon its &quot;General Undertaking&quot;, which would have extended the line to Bettws-y-Coed and beyond. By December of that year, Spooner reported that all but of the line had been built and was &quot;nearly ready to open to traffic&quot; and that mineral traffic would commence immediately.

The line from Dinas Junction to Tryfan Junction and on to Bryngwyn was opened in 1877. In 1878, a branch was built from Tryfan Junction to Snowdon Ranger and this was extended to South Snowdon (later renamed Rhyd Ddu) in 1881. In 1884, the company began the process of relaying the track, upgrading from iron rails weighing 35 lbs per yard, to steel rails weighing 41.5 lbs per yard. At the October 1887 board meeting of the company, a proposal to extend the line from Dinas Junction to Carnarvon was passed unanimously. This extension was never built.

In 1900, the railway company was granted permission for an extension of the main line from South Snowdon to Beddgelert. This was the , which allowed the extension to be built under the Light Railways Act 1896. This extension was not built.

In 1905, the Board of Trade granted permission for the whole railway to convert to a light railway under the Light Railways Act 1896. In 1906, Sir James Szlumper joined the board of directors, and by 1910 he had been elected chairman of the board. The 1910 report showed that 6-month net revenues had fallen to £200 amidst a general depression in the country. The difficult financial situation caused the company caused to attempt to find a buyer. In 1910, they approached the London and North Western Railway - who owned the Carnarvon to Afon Wen branch - and negotiations proceeded far enough that the acquisition was announced, but it was not completed.

In 1914, a combined committee of several local authorities applied for a Light Railway Order to combine the NWNGRs with the Portmadoc, Beddgelert &amp; South Snowdon Railway which owned the Croesor Tramway. The accelerating conflict of the First World War stopped this effort. The NWNGRs shut down their passenger services in 1916, and from then on ran a shoestring goods service. In 1918, the application was revived by the owners of the Aluminium Corporation of Dolgarrog which had acquired the Portmadoc, Beddgelert &amp; South Snowdon Railway and was seeking to acquire the NWNGRs. This effort eventually led to the acquisition of the NWNGRs by the Aluminium Corporation and its incorporation into the Welsh Highland Railway in 1922.

<text>Yabaolu (, ) is a street and area in Beijing, China, running from Chaoyangmen Outer Street to Jianguomen Outer Street. The south part of Yabaolu is home to . On the west side of Yabaolu lies Ritan Park.

As of 2011 the community has many high rise shopping malls and shops, is a major hub of trade. Previously it was a community of one story courtyards with little activity.

==Name==
Yabaolu, &quot;elegant treasure road,&quot; is one of the many Old Beijing place names to have been beautified. The original name was &quot;Yaba Hutong&quot; (), lit. &quot;mute man alley&quot;.

==Yabaolu markets==
The northern area of Yabaolu is sometimes unofficially named Russiatown, since the clientele of the shops is mostly foreign, with most of that being Russian, and because the neighbourhood has a high population of Russian traders from Siberia, who are transient. Previously local Chinese people called the traders &quot;dà dǎoyé&quot; (大倒爷, &quot;big trader&quot;), while as of 2011 they now refer to them as &quot;hǎo péngyou&quot; (好朋友, &quot;good friend&quot;). In addition to Russian traders, Polish, Ukrainian, former Yugoslav, and other eastern European traders also do business in Yabaolu. Jaime FlorCruz of &quot;CNN&quot; said in 2011 that &quot;Here bargaining is tough but business is good. The most successful, traders say, can resell their items for 20 times their investment.&quot;

The China-Russia-related trade in Beijing occurs in Yabaolu. Most of the businesses in Yabaolu cater to Russian customers. Many restaurant owners and shop keepers do business in Yabaolu. Some pedicab drivers speak pidgin Russian and charge the equivalent of two U.S. dollars for a ride. Like many ethnic enclaves, it has its own unique culture imported by its residents. The focal point of the district are several large clothing markets. Business signs are mostly in Russian and written in Cyrillic, a surprise to many tourists. For a former Russian area in Beijing, see Li-Fan Yuan.

FlorCruz said that around 1991 &quot;loaded up scores boxes of goods -- mostly cheap clothes -- onto decrepit trailer trucks bound for train stations&quot; while in 2011 traders &quot;employ shipping companies to move various goods that include silk dresses and shirts, fur jackets, toys and handbags.&quot;

After the Beijing Olympics several large modern shopping centres, such as Chaowai-Men, You-Town, have been developed - some to cater more to retail shoppers than wholesale traders.

<doc id="1145657" wikidata="Q1759552" url="?curid=1145657" title="Transurethral resection of the prostate">
<text>Transurethral resection of the prostate (commonly known as a TURP, plural TURPs, and rarely as a transurethral prostatic resection, TUPR) is a urological operation. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As the name indicates, it is performed by visualising the prostate through the urethra and removing tissue by electrocautery or sharp dissection. It has been the standard treatment for BPH for many years, but recently alternative, minimally invasive techniques have become available. This procedure is done with spinal or general anaesthetic. A triple lumen catheter is inserted through the urethra to irrigate and drain the bladder after the surgical procedure is complete. The outcome is considered excellent for 80–90% of BPH patients. The procedure carries minimal risk for erectile dysfunction, moderate risk for bleeding, and a large risk for retrograde ejaculation.

== Indications ==
BPH is normally initially treated medically through alpha antagonists such as tamsulosin, or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride. If medical treatment does not reduce a patient&#x27;s urinary symptoms, a TURP may be considered following a careful examination of the prostate or bladder through a cystoscope. If TURP is contraindicated, a urologist may consider a simple prostatectomy, in and out catheters, or a supra-pubic catheter to help a patient void urine effectively. As the medical management of BPH improves, the number of TURPs has been decreasing.

==Types of TURP==
Traditionally, a cystoscope (a &quot;resectoscope&quot;) has been used to perform TURP. The scope is passed through the urethra to the prostate where surrounding prostate tissue can then be excised. There are two types of modalities:
* Monopolar TURP: A monopolar device utilizing a wire loop with electric current flowing in one direction (thus monopolar) can be used to excise tissue via the resectoscope. A grounding ESU pad and irrigation by a non conducting fluid is required to prevent this current from disturbing surrounding tissues. This fluid (usually glycine) can cause damage to surrounding tissue after prolonged exposure, resulting in TUR syndrome, so surgery time is limited.
* Bipolar TURP: This is a newer technique that uses bipolar current to remove the tissue. Bipolar TURP allows saline irrigation and eliminates the need for an ESU grounding pad thus preventing post-TURP hyponatremia (TUR syndrome) and reducing other complications. As a result, bipolar TURP is also not subject to the same surgical time constraints of conventional TURP.

A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies including 8924 men with BPH urinary symptoms found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably result in comparable improvements in urinary symptoms, as well as in similar erectile function, incidence of urinary incontinence and need for retreatment. Bipolar surgery likely reduces the risk of TUR syndrome and the need for blood transfusion.

Another transurethral method utilizes laser energy to remove tissue. With laser prostate surgery a fiber optic cable pushed through the urethra is used to transmit lasers such as holmium-Nd:YAG high-powered &quot;red&quot; or potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) &quot;green&quot; to vaporize the adenoma. More recently the KTP laser has been supplanted by a higher power laser source based on a lithium triborate crystal, though it is still commonly referred to as a &quot;Greenlight&quot; or KTP procedure. The specific advantages of utilizing laser energy rather than a traditional electrosurgical TURP is a decrease in the relative blood loss, elimination of the risk of post-TURP hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), the ability to treat larger glands, as well as treating patients who are actively being treated with anticoagulation therapy for unrelated diagnosis.

A further transurethal method utilizes a robotically-controlled waterjet to remove prostate tissue. Visualization is provided by a combination of cystoscope and transrectal ultrasound methods. This procedure claims risk reduction advantages as a result of being heat free.

==Risks==


Because of bleeding risks associated with the procedure, TURP is not considered safe for many patients with cardiac problems.

Postoperative complications include:

=== Acute complications ===
* Bleeding (most common). Bleeding may be reduced by pre-treatment with an anti-androgen such as finasteride or flutamide.
* Clot retention and clot colic. The blood released from the resected prostate may become stuck in the urethra and can cause pain and urine retention.
* Bladder wall injury, such as perforation (rare). Intraperitoneal bladder rupture will present with upper abdominal pain and referred pain to the shoulder. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture may present with inguinal, peri-umbilical pain.
* TURP syndrome: Hyponatremia and water intoxication caused by an overload of fluid absorption from the open prostatic sinusoids during the procedure. This complication can lead to confusion, changes in mental status, vomiting, nausea, and even coma. To prevent TURP syndrome, the length of the procedure is limited to less than one hour in many centers, and the height of the container of irrigating solution above the surgical table – determining the hydrostatic pressure driving fluid into the prostatic veins and sinuses – is kept to a minimum. The classic triad of TURP syndrome includes elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures with increased pulse pressure, bradycardia, and mental status changes (assuming an awake patient under regional anesthesia).&lt;
* The different types of irrigation fluids used for TURP each have specific disadvantages. Glycine irrigating solution may cause transient blindness. Distilled water has the highest risk for intravascular hemolysis, hypervolemia, and dilutional hyponatremia. Balanced salt solutions (such as normal saline) cause electrical current dispersion during TURP, but significantly reduce the risk of TURP syndrome.  Sorbitol and mannitol solutions may lead to hyperglycemia (sorbitol), intravascular fluid expansion with absorption (mannitol), and osmotic diuresis (sorbitol and mannitol).

=== Chronic complications ===
In most cases, urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction resolve on their own within 6 to 12 months post-TURP. Therefore, many doctors will postpone invasive treatment until a year after the surgery.
* Urinary incontinence – most commonly stress incontinence – due to injury of the external sphincter system, may be prevented by taking the verumontanum of the prostate as a distal limiting boundary during TURP. Initial management includes lifestyle changes, bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training, and using incontinence pads. The current gold standard of management for persistent urinary incontinence after prostatectomy is the placement of an artificial urinary sphincter. Male slings are an alternative for mild to moderate post-prostatectomy incontinence.
* Retrograde ejaculation due to injury of the prostatic urethra. This is one of the most frequent complications of the procedure, occurring in about 65% of patients.
* Bladder neck stenosis.
* Erectile dysfunction may be seen in some patients, however, many have reported that erectile function improved after TURP.

Additionally, transurethral resection of the prostate is associated with a low risk of mortality.

== Research ==
The UNBLOCS trial compared using TURP to the thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP). Both methods led to similar improvements, number of complications and lengths of hospital stay. Both were effective as treatment but TURP resulted in a better urinary flow rate.

<text>Ondansetron, sold under the brand name Zofran among others, is a medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, migraines, or surgery. It is also effective for treating gastroenteritis. It can be given orally (by mouth), intramuscularly (injection into a muscle), or intravenously (injection into a vein).
Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and itchiness. Serious side effects include QT prolongation and severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied in this group. It is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and therefore does not cause akathisia. 
Ondansetron was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 61st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Ondansetron is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and postoperative nausea and vomiting.

===Pregnancy===
Ondansetron is used off-label to treat morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after other antiemetic drugs have failed.

A large multi-center cohort study found no association between ondansetron exposure and fetal risk compared to other antiemetics.

===Cyclic vomiting syndrome===
Ondansetron is one of several antiemetics used during the vomiting phase of cyclic vomiting syndrome.

===Gastroenteritis===
Trials in emergency department settings support the use of ondansetron to abort vomiting episodes associated with gastroenteritis and dehydration. A randomized controlled trial using a single dose of oral ondansetron in children with presumably viral gastroenteritis found it to be highly effective in stopping vomiting and increasing the effectiveness of oral rehydration therapy, thereby significantly increasing patient satisfaction. Only 16 of the 123 children treated with ondansetron vomited in the following 6 hours. A retrospective review found that ondansetron was used commonly for vomiting due to gastroenteritis, being administered in over 58% of cases. Its use reduced hospital admissions, but was also associated with higher rates of return visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, people who had initially received ondansetron were more likely to be admitted on the return visit than people who had not received the drug. However, this effect may simply be due to the agent being used more frequently in people who present with more severe illness. Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses.

=== Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ===
In a study of patients diagnosed as having IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), ondansetron showed statistically significant effects on stool consistency, frequency, urgency and bloating, but not on pain scores. This was confirmed in a later trial and meta-analysis and is included in international guidelines.

==Special populations==

===Children===
Ondansetron has rarely been studied in people under 4 years of age. As such, little data is available to guide dosage recommendations.

Three open non-comparative studies have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in children receiving a variety of chemotherapy regimens.

Ondansetron was well tolerated and none of the patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms.

==Adverse effects==
Headache is the most common adverse effect. A review of use for post-operative nausea and vomiting found that for every 36 people treated, one would experience headache, which could be severe.

Constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness are other commonly reported side effects. It is broken down by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.

===QT prolongation===
Use of ondansetron has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to a potentially fatal heart rhythm known as &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;. Although this may happen in any person with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in people taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in people with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16 mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24 mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. People are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron.

===Overdose===
No specific treatment is available for ondansetron overdose; people are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to ondansetron is not known.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Ondansetron is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema in the medulla. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron&#x27;s antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors. The &quot;R&quot;– and &quot;S&quot;–ondansetron isomers have similar potency as serotonin antagonists when tested on &quot;ex vivo&quot; rat vagus nerve. However, the &quot;R&quot;–ondansetron enantiomer was 7.9 times more potent as an antagonist of serotonin and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methylserotonin) when tested on the longitudinal smooth muscle from guinea pig ileum. However, the guinea pig ileum test was likely not as faithful as a test of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism, because ondansetron only partially blocked the effect of serotonin, while it completely blocked the effect of 2-methylserotonin.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Ondansetron may have a degree of peripheral selectivity due to binding to P-glycoprotein and efflux out of the brain at the blood–brain barrier. Ondansetron is marketed as a racemic mixture of &quot;R&quot;–(–)–ondansetron and &quot;S&quot;–(+)–ondansetron, and the two enantiomers have significantly different kinetics. In rats given 2 mg/kg intravenous doses of each enantiomer separately, &quot;R&quot;–(–)–ondansetron was found to have a 37% longer half-life (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.05) and an 87% higher area-under-curve or AUC (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.01) compared to &quot;S&quot;–(+)–ondansetron, indicating that the &quot;R&quot; enantiomer is metabolized more slowly. The chiral carbon in ondansetron is adjacent to a carbonyl group, so keto-enol tautomerism could theoretically lead to interconversion between the two enantiomers under physiologic conditions, if the hydrogen on the chiral carbon were removed and then replaced with opposite chirality. An experiment in rats given each enantiomer separately showed no evidence of this interconversion, the chirality was stable &quot;in vivo&quot;. A study of 141 human patients given 4 or 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting also found that &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;–ondansetron have different pharmacokinetic properties. Each patient was classified according to their genotype for the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, and they were put on a spectrum between poor metabolizers (slow) and ultra metabolizers (fast). CYP2D6 was found to be more important for the elimination of &quot;S&quot;–ondansetron, whereas CYP3A5 genotype had no impact on &quot;S&quot;–ondansetron plasma levels, measured 3 hours after drug administration. CYP3A5 was more important for &quot;R&quot;–ondansetron clearance, and CYP2D6 genotype had no consistent effect on plasma levels of &quot;R&quot;–ondansetron at 3 hours.

==History==
Ondansetron (marketed under the brand name Zofran) was developed in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted U.S. patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline&#x27;s research on pediatric use, ondansetron&#x27;s patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US). The first generic versions were approved by the U.S. FDA in December 2006, with marketing approval granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals.

In December 2012, the FDA announced that the 32mg, single intravenous (IV) dose of ondansetron was being withdrawn from U.S. market because of the potential for serious cardiac issues from prolonged QT interval.

In 2018, University of São Paulo and Biolab were granted a patent for an orodispersible form of the drug.

==Society and culture==

===Publication bias===
In 1997, ondansetron was the subject of a meta-analysis case study. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 people receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4 mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron&#x27;s antiemetic efficacy.

In addition, the authors found the covert duplication of reports on ondansetron was not easy to detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 1999.

===Availability===
Ondansetron is a generic medication and is available in many countries under many brand names.

== Research ==
Ondansetron may be useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting that can sometimes be induced by certain serotonergic psychedelics.

<text>Raymond Bernard Cattell (20 March 1905 – 2 February 1998) was a British-American psychologist, known for his psychometric research into intrapersonal psychological structure. His work also explored the basic dimensions of personality and temperament, the range of cognitive abilities, the dynamic dimensions of motivation and emotion, the clinical dimensions of abnormal personality, patterns of group syntality and social behavior, applications of personality research to psychotherapy and learning theory, predictors of creativity and achievement, and many multivariate research methods including the refinement of factor analytic methods for exploring and measuring these domains. Cattell authored, co-authored, or edited almost 60 scholarly books, more than 500 research articles, and over 30 standardized psychometric tests, questionnaires, and rating scales. According to a widely cited ranking, Cattell was the 16th most eminent, 7th most cited in the scientific journal literature, and among the most productive psychologists of the 20th century.

Cattell was an early proponent of using factor analytic methods instead of what he called &quot;subjective verbal theorizing&quot; to explore empirically the basic dimensions of personality, motivation, and cognitive abilities. One of the results of Cattell&#x27;s application of factor analysis was his discovery of 16 separate primary trait factors within the normal personality sphere (based on the trait lexicon). He called these factors &quot;source traits&quot;. This theory of personality factors and the self-report instrument used to measure them are known respectively as the 16 personality factor model and the 16PF Questionnaire (16PF).

Cattell also undertook a series of empirical studies into the basic dimensions of other psychological domains: intelligence, motivation, career assessment and vocational interests. Cattell theorized the existence of fluid and crystallized intelligence to explain human cognitive ability, investigated changes in Gf and Gc over the lifespan, and constructed the Culture Fair Intelligence Test to minimize the bias of written language and cultural background in intelligence testing.

==Innovations and accomplishments==
Cattell&#x27;s research was mainly in personality, abilities, motivations, and innovative multivariate research methods and statistical analysis (especially his many refinements to exploratory factor analytic methodology). In his personality research, he is best remembered for his factor-analytically derived 16-factor model of normal personality structure, arguing for this model over Eysenck&#x27;s simpler higher-order 3-factor model, and constructing measures of these primary factors in the form of the 16PF Questionnaire (and its downward extensions: HSPQ, and CPQ, respectively). He was the first to propose a hierarchical, multi-level model of personality with the many basic primary factors at the first level and the fewer, broader, &quot;second-order&quot; factors at a higher stratum of personality organization. These &quot;global trait&quot; constructs are the precursors of the currently popular Big Five (FFM) model of personality. Cattell&#x27;s research led to further advances, such as distinguishing between state and trait measures (e.g., state-trait anxiety), ranging on a continuum from immediate transitory emotional states, through longer-acting mood states, dynamic motivational traits, and also relatively enduring personality traits. Cattell also conducted empirical studies into developmental changes in personality trait constructs across the lifespan.

In the cognitive abilities domain, Cattell researched a wide range of abilities, but is best known for the distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence. He distinguished between the abstract, adaptive, biologically-influenced cognitive abilities that he called &quot;fluid intelligence&quot; and the applied, experience-based and learning-enhanced ability that he called &quot;crystallized intelligence.&quot; Thus, for example, a mechanic who has worked on airplane engines for 30 years might have a huge amount of &quot;crystallized&quot; knowledge about the workings of these engines, while a new young engineer with more &quot;fluid intelligence&quot; might focus more on the theory of engine functioning, these two types of abilities might complement each other and work together toward achieving a goal. As a foundation for this distinction, Cattell developed the investment-model of ability, arguing that crystallized ability emerged from the investment of fluid ability in a particular topic of knowledge. He contributed to cognitive epidemiology with his theory that crystallized knowledge, while more applied, could be maintained or even increase after fluid ability begins to decline with age, a concept used in the National Adult Reading Test (NART). Cattell constructed a number of ability tests, including the Comprehensive Ability Battery (CAB) that provides measures of 20 primary abilities, and the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT) which was designed to provide a completely non-verbal measure of intelligence like that now seen in the Raven&#x27;s. The Culture Fair Intelligence Scales were intended to minimize the influence of cultural or educational background on the results of intelligence tests.

In regard to statistical methodology, in 1960 Cattell founded the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP), and its journal &quot;Multivariate Behavioral Research&quot;, in order to bring together, encourage, and support scientists interested in multi-variate research. He was an early and frequent user of factor analysis (a statistical procedure for finding underlying factors in data). Cattell also developed new factor analytic techniques, for example, by inventing the scree test, which uses the curve of latent roots to judge the optimal number of factors to extract. He also developed a new factor analysis rotation procedure—the &quot;Procrustes&quot; or non-orthogonal rotation, designed to let the data itself determine the best location of factors, rather than requiring orthogonal factors. Additional contributions include the Coefficient of Profile Similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of two score profiles); P-technique factor analysis based on repeated measurements of a single individual (sampling of variables, rather than sampling of persons); dR-technique factor analysis for elucidating change dimensions (including transitory emotional states, and longer-lasting mood states); the Taxonome program for ascertaining the number and contents of clusters in a data set; the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure factor pattern solutions. As well, he put forward the Dynamic Calculus for assessing interests and motivation, the Basic Data Relations Box (assessing dimensions of experimental designs), the group syntality construct (&quot;personality&quot; of a group), the triadic theory of cognitive abilities, the Ability Dimension Analysis Chart (ADAC), and Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis (MAVA), with &quot;specification equations&quot; to embody genetic and environmental variables and their interactions.

As Lee J. Cronbach at Stanford University stated:

==Biography==

===England===
Raymond Cattell was born on 20 March 1905 in Hill Top, West Bromwich, a small town in England near Birmingham where his father&#x27;s family was involved in inventing new parts for engines, automobiles and other machines. Thus, his growing up years were a time when great technological and scientific ideas and advances were taking place and this greatly influenced his perspective on how a few people could actually make a difference in the world. He wrote: &quot;1905 was a felicitous year in which to be born. The airplane was just a year old. The Curies and Rutherford in that year penetrated the heart of the atom and the mystery of its radiations, Alfred Binet launched the first intelligence test, and Einstein, the theory of relativity.

When Cattell was about five years old, his family moved to Torquay, Devon, in the south-west of England, where he grew up with strong interests in science and spent a lot of time sailing around the coastline. He was the first of his family (and the only one in his generation) to attend university: in 1921, he was awarded a scholarship to study chemistry at King&#x27;s College, London, where he obtained a BSc (Hons) degree with 1st-class honors at age 19 years. While studying physics and chemistry at university he learned from influential people in many other fields, who visited or lived in London. He writes:

As he observed first-hand the terrible destruction and suffering after World War I, Cattell was increasingly attracted to the idea of applying the tools of science to the serious human problems that he saw around him. He stated that in the cultural upheaval after WWI, he felt that his laboratory table had begun to seem too small and the world&#x27;s problems so vast. Thus, he decided to change his field of study and pursue a PhD in psychology at King&#x27;s College, London, which he received in 1929. The title of his PhD dissertation was &quot;The Subjective Character of Cognition and Pre-Sensational Development of Perception&quot;. His PhD advisor at King&#x27;s College, London, was Francis Aveling, D.D., D.Sc., PhD, D.Litt., who was also President of the British Psychological Society from 1926 until 1929. In 1939, Cattell was honored for his outstanding contributions to psychological research with conferral of the prestigious higher doctorate D.Sc. from the University of London.

While working on his PhD, Cattell had accepted a position teaching and counseling in the Department of Education at Exeter University. He ultimately found this disappointing because there was limited opportunity to conduct research. Cattell did his graduate work with Charles Spearman, the English psychologist and statistician who is famous for his pioneering work on assessing intelligence, including the development of the idea of a general factor of intelligence termed &quot;g&quot;. During his three years at Exeter, Cattell courted and married Monica Rogers, whom he had known since his boyhood in Devon and they had a son together. She left him about four years later. Soon afterward he moved to Leicester where he organized one of England&#x27;s first child guidance clinics. It was also in this time period that he finished his first book &quot;Under Sail Through Red Devon,&quot; which described his many adventures sailing around the coastline and estuaries of South Devon and Dartmoor.

===United States===
In 1937, Cattell left England and moved to the United States when he was invited by Edward Thorndike to come to Columbia University. When the G. Stanley Hall professorship in psychology became available at Clark University in 1938, Cattell was recommended by Thorndike and was appointed to the position. However, he conducted little research there and was &quot;continually depressed.&quot; Cattell was invited by Gordon Allport to join the Harvard University faculty in 1941. While at Harvard he began some of the research in personality that would become the foundation for much of his later scientific work.

During World War II, Cattell served as a civilian consultant to the U.S. government researching and developing tests for selecting officers in the armed forces. Cattell returned to teaching at Harvard and married Alberta Karen Schuettler, a PhD student in mathematics at Radcliffe College. Over the years, she worked with Cattell on many aspects of his research, writing, and test development. They had three daughters and a son. They divorced in 1980.

Herbert Woodrow, professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was searching for someone with a background in multivariate methods to establish a research laboratory. Cattell was invited to assume this position in 1945. With this newly created research professorship in psychology, he was able to obtain sufficient grant support for two PhD associates, four graduate research assistants, and clerical assistance.

One reason that Cattell moved to the University of Illinois was because the first electronic computer built and owned entirely by a US educational institution &quot;Illinois Automatic Computer&quot; was being developed there, which made it possible for him to complete large-scale factor analyses. Cattell founded the Laboratory of Personality Assessment and Group Behavior. In 1949, he and his wife founded the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT). Karen Cattell served as director of IPAT until 1993. Cattell remained in the Illinois research professorship until he reached the university&#x27;s mandatory retirement age in 1973. A few years after he retired from the University of Illinois he built a home in Boulder, Colorado, where he wrote and published the results of a variety of research projects that had been left unfinished in Illinois.

In 1977, Cattell moved to Hawaii, largely because of his love of the ocean and sailing. He continued his career as a part-time professor and adviser at the University of Hawaii. He also served as adjunct faculty of the Hawaii School of Professional Psychology. After settling in Hawaii he married Heather Birkett, a clinical psychologist, who later carried out extensive research using the 16PF and other tests. During the last two decades of his life in Hawaii, Cattell continued to publish a variety of scientific articles, as well as books on motivation, the scientific use of factor analysis, two volumes of personality and learning theory, the inheritance of personality, and co-edited a book on functional psychological testing, as well as a complete revision of his highly renowned &quot;Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology&quot;.

Cattell and Heather Birkett Cattell lived on a lagoon in the southeast corner of Oahu where he kept a small sailing boat. Around 1990, he had to give up his sailing career because of navigational challenges resulting from old age. He died at home in Honolulu on 2 February 1998, at age 92 years. He is buried in the Valley of the Temples on a hillside overlooking the sea. His will provided for his remaining funds to build a school for underprivileged children in Cambodia. He was an agnostic.

==Scientific orientation==
When Cattell began his career in psychology in the 1920s, he felt that the domain of personality was dominated by speculative ideas that were largely intuitive with little/no empirical research basis. Cattell accepted E.L. Thorndike&#x27;s empiricist viewpoint that &quot;If something actually did exist, it existed in some amount and hence could be measured.&quot;.

Cattell found that constructs used by early psychological theorists tended to be somewhat subjective and poorly defined. For example, after examining over 400 published papers on the topic of &quot;anxiety&quot; in 1965, Cattell stated: &quot;The studies showed so many fundamentally different meanings used for anxiety and different ways of measuring it, that the studies could not even be integrated.&quot; Early personality theorists tended to provide little objective evidence or research bases for their theories. Cattell wanted psychology to become more like other sciences, whereby a theory could be tested in an objective way that could be understood and replicated by others. In Cattell&#x27;s words:

:&quot;Psychology appeared to be a jungle of confusing, conflicting, and arbitrary concepts. These pre-scientific theories doubtless contained insights which still surpass in refinement those depended upon by psychiatrists or psychologists today. But who knows, among the many brilliant ideas offered, which are the true ones? Some will claim that the statements of one theorist are correct, but others will favour the views of another. Then there is no objective way of sorting out the truth except through scientific research.&quot;

Emeritus Professor Arthur B. Sweney, an expert in psychometric test construction, summed up Cattell&#x27;s methodology:

:&quot;[Cattell] was without exception the one man who made the most major strides in systematizing the field of behavioral science from all of its diverse facets into a real science based on empirical, replicable and universal principles. Seldom has psychology had such a determined, systematic explorer dedicated not only to the basic search for scientific knowledge but also to the need to apply science for the benefit of all.&quot; 

Also, according to Sheehy (2004, p. 62),

:&quot;Cattell made fundamental contributions to our understanding of ability and the structure of personality.&quot;

In 1994, Cattell was one of 52 signatories of &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence,&quot; an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. In the letter the signers, some of whom were intelligence researchers, defended the publication of the book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;. There was sharp pushback on the letter, with a number of signers (not Cattell) having received funding from white supremacist organizations.

His works can be categorized or defined as part of cognitive psychology, due to his nature to measure every psychological aspect especially personality aspect.

==Multivariate research==
Rather than pursue a &quot;univariate&quot; research approach to psychology, studying the effect that a single variable (such as &quot;dominance&quot;) might have on another variable (such as &quot;decision-making&quot;), Cattell pioneered the use of multivariate experimental psychology (the analysis of several variables simultaneously). He believed that behavioral dimensions were too complex and interactive to fully understand variables in isolation. The classical univariate approach required bringing the individual into an artificial laboratory situation and measuring the effect of one particular variable on another also known as the &quot;bivariate&quot; approach, while the multivariate approach allowed psychologists to study the whole person and their unique combination of traits within a natural environmental context. Multivariate experimental research designs and multivariate statistical analyses allowed for the study of &quot;real-life&quot; situations (e.g., depression, divorce, loss) that could not be manipulated in an artificial laboratory environment.

Cattell applied multivariate research methods across several intrapersonal psychological domains: the trait constructs (both normal and abnormal) of personality, motivational or dynamic traits, emotional and mood states, as well as the diverse array of cognitive abilities. In each of these domains, he considered there must be a finite number of basic, unitary dimensions that could be identified empirically. He drew a comparison between these fundamental, underlying (source) traits and the basic dimensions of the physical world that were discovered and presented, for example, in the periodic table of chemical elements.

In 1960, Cattell organized and convened an international symposium to increase communication and cooperation among researchers who were using multivariate statistics to study human behavior. This resulted in the foundation of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP) and its flagship journal, &quot;Multivariate Behavioral Research&quot;. He brought many researchers from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America to work in his lab at the University of Illinois. Many of his books involving multivariate experimental research were written in collaboration with notable colleagues.

==Factor analysis==
Cattell noted that in the hard sciences such as chemistry, physics, astronomy, as well as in medical science, unsubstantiated theories were historically widespread until new instruments were developed to improve scientific observation and measurement. In the 1920s, Cattell worked with Charles Spearman who was developing the new statistical technique of factor analysis in his effort to understand the basic dimensions and structure of human abilities. Factor analysis became a powerful tool to help uncover the basic dimensions underlying a confusing array of surface variables within a particular domain.

Factor analysis was built upon the earlier development of the correlation coefficient, which provides a numerical estimate of the degree to which variables are &quot;co-related&quot;. For example, if &quot;frequency of exercise&quot; and &quot;blood pressure level&quot; were measured on a large group of people, then intercorrelating these two variables would provide a quantitative estimate of the degree to which &quot;exercise&quot; and &quot;blood pressure&quot; are directly related to each other. Factor analysis performs complex calculations on the correlation coefficients among the variables within a particular domain (such as cognitive ability or personality trait constructs) to determine the basic, unitary factors underlying the particular domain.

While working at the University of London with Spearman exploring the number and nature of human abilities, Cattell postulated that factor analysis could be applied to other areas beyond the domain of abilities. In particular, Cattell was interested in exploring the basic taxonomic dimensions and structure of human personality. He believed that if exploratory factor analysis were applied to a wide range of measures of interpersonal functioning, the basic dimensions within the domain of social behavior could be identified. Thus, factor analysis could be used to discover the fundamental dimensions underlying the large number of surface behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective research.

As noted above, Cattell made many important innovative contributions to factor analytic methodology, including the Scree Test to estimate the optimal number of factors to extract, the &quot;Procrustes&quot; oblique rotation strategy, the Coefficient of Profile Similarity, P-technique factor analysis, dR-technique factor analysis, the Taxonome program, as well the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure solutions. In addition, many eminent researchers received their grounding in factor analytic methodology under the guidance of Cattell, including Richard Gorsuch, an authority on exploratory factor analytic methods.

==Personality theory==
In order to apply factor analysis to personality, Cattell believed it was necessary to sample the widest possible range of variables. He specified three kinds of data for comprehensive sampling, to capture the full range of personality dimensions:
# Life data (or L-data), which involves collecting data from the individual&#x27;s natural, everyday life behaviors, measuring their characteristic behavior patterns in the real world. This could range from number of traffic accidents or number of parties attended each month, to grade point average in school or number of illnesses or divorces.
# Experimental data (or T-data) which involves reactions to standardized experimental situations created in a lab where a subject&#x27;s behavior can be objectively observed and measured.
# Questionnaire data (or Q-data), which involves responses based on introspection by the individual about their own behavior and feelings. He found that this kind of direct questioning often measured subtle internal states and viewpoints that might be hard to see or measure in external behavior.

In order for a personality dimension to be called &quot;fundamental and unitary,&quot; Cattell believed that it needed to be found in factor analyses of data from all three of these measurement domains. Thus, Cattell constructed measures of a wide range of personality traits in each medium (L-data; Q-data; T-data). He then conducted a programmatic series of factor analyses on the data derived from each of the three measurement media in order to elucidate the dimensionality of human personality structure.

With the help of many colleagues, Cattell&#x27;s factor-analytic studies continued over several decades, eventually finding at least 16 primary trait factors underlying human personality (comprising 15 personality dimensions and one cognitive ability dimension: Factor B in the 16PF). He decided to name these traits with letters (A, B, C, D, E...) in order to avoid misnaming these newly discovered dimensions, or inviting confusion with existing vocabulary and concepts. Factor-analytic studies conducted by many researchers in diverse cultures around the world have provided substantial support for the validity of these 16 trait dimensions.

In order to measure these trait constructs across different age ranges, Cattell constructed (Q-data) instruments that included the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) for adults, the High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) now named the Adolescent Personality Questionnaire (APQ), and the Children&#x27;s Personality Questionnaire (CPQ). Cattell also constructed the (T-data) Objective Analytic Battery (OAB) that provided measures of the 10 largest personality trait factors extracted factor analytically, as well as objective (T-data) measures of dynamic trait constructs such as the Motivation Analysis Test (MAT), the School Motivation Analysis Test (SMAT), and the Children&#x27;s Motivation Analysis Test (CMAT). In order to measure trait constructs within the abnormal personality sphere, Cattell constructed the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ) Part 1 of the CAQ measures the 16PF factors, While Part 2 measures an additional 12 abnormal (psychopathological) personality trait dimensions. The CAQ was later re-badged as the PsychEval Personality Questionnaire (PEPQ). Also within the broadly conceptualized personality domain, Cattell constructed measures of mood states and transitory emotional states, including the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ) In addition, Cattell was at the forefront in constructing the Central Trait-State Kit.

From the very beginning of his academic career, Cattell reasoned that, as in other scientific domains like intelligence, there might be an additional, higher level of organization within personality which would provide a structure for the many primary traits. When he factor analyzed the intercorrelations of the 16 primary trait measures themselves, he found no fewer than five &quot;second-order&quot; or &quot;global factors&quot;, now commonly known as the Big Five. These second-stratum or &quot;global traits&quot; are conceptualized as broad, overarching domains of behavior, which provide meaning and structure for the primary traits. For example, the &quot;global trait&quot; Extraversion has emerged from factor-analytic results comprising the five primary trait factors that are interpersonal in focus.

Thus, &quot;global&quot; Extraversion is fundamentally defined by the primary traits that are grouped together factor analytically, and, moving in the opposite direction, the second-order Extraversion factor gives conceptual meaning and structure to these primary traits, identifying their focus and function in human personality. These two levels of personality structure can provide an integrated understanding of the whole person, with the &quot;global traits&quot; giving an overview of the individual&#x27;s functioning in a broad-brush way, and the more-specific primary trait scores providing an in-depth, detailed picture of the individual&#x27;s unique trait combinations (Cattell&#x27;s &quot;Depth Psychometry&quot; p. 71).

Research into the 16PF personality factors has shown these constructs to be useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of real life behaviors. Thus, the 16 primary trait measures plus the five major second-stratum factors have been used in educational settings to study and predict achievement motivation, learning or cognitive style, creativity, and compatible career choices; in work or employment settings to predict leadership style, interpersonal skills, creativity, conscientiousness, stress-management, and accident-proneness; in medical settings to predict heart attack proneness, pain management variables, likely compliance with medical instructions, or recovery pattern from burns or organ transplants; in clinical settings to predict self-esteem, interpersonal needs, frustration tolerance, and openness to change; and, in research settings to predict a wide range of behavioral proclivities such as aggression, conformity, and authoritarianism.

Cattell&#x27;s programmatic multivariate research which extended from the 1940s through the 70&#x27;s resulted in several books that have been widely recognized as identifying fundamental taxonomic dimensions of human personality and motivation and their organizing principles:
* &quot;The Description and Measurement of Personality&quot; (1946)
* &quot;An Introduction to Personality Study&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Personality: A Systematic, Theoretical, and Factual Study&quot; (1950)
* &quot;Factor Analysis&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Personality and Motivation Structure and Measurement&quot; (1957)
* &quot;The Meaning and Measurement of Neuroticism and Anxiety&quot; (1961)
* &quot;Personality Factors in Objective Test Devices&quot; (1965)
* &quot;The Scientific Analysis of Personality&quot; (1965)
* &quot;Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Objective Personality and Motivation Tests&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Handbook for the Sixteen Personality Questionnaire&quot; (16PF) (1970)
* &quot;Personality and Mood by Questionnaire&quot; (1973)

* &quot;Human Motivation and the Dynamic Calculus&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Psychotherapy by Structured Learning Theory&quot; (1987)

The books listed above document a programmatic series of empirical research studies based on quantitative personality data derived from objective tests (T-data), from self-report questionnaires (Q-data), and from observer ratings (L-data). They present a theory of personality development over the human life span, including effects on the individual&#x27;s behavior from family, social, cultural, biological, and genetic influences, as well as influences from the domains of motivation and ability.

As Hans Eysenck at the Institute of Psychiatry, London remarked:&quot;Cattell has been one of the most prolific writers in psychology since Wilhelm Wundt...According to the Citation Index, he is one of the ten most cited psychologists, and this is true with regard to not only citations in social science journals but also those in science journals generally. Of the two hundred and fifty most cited scientists, only three psychologists made the grade, namely, Sigmund Freud in the first place, then the reviewer [H.J. Eysenck], and then Cattell. Thus there is no question that Cattell has made a tremendous impression on psychology and science in general.&quot;
He was a controversial figure due in part to his friendships with, and intellectual respect for, white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

==Views on race and eugenics==

William H. Tucker and Barry Mehler have criticized Cattell based on his writings about evolution and political systems. They argue that Cattell adhered to a mixture of eugenics and a new religion of his devising which he eventually named Beyondism and proposed as &quot;a new morality from science&quot;. Tucker notes that Cattell thanked the prominent neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideologues Roger Pearson, Wilmot Robertson, and Revilo P. Oliver in the preface to his &quot;Beyondism,&quot; and that a Beyondist newsletter with which Cattell was involved favorably reviewed Robertson&#x27;s book &quot;The Ethnostate&quot;.

Cattell claimed that a diversity of cultural groups was necessary to allow that evolution. He speculated about natural selection based on both the separation of groups and also the restriction of &quot;external&quot; assistance to &quot;failing&quot; groups from &quot;successful&quot; ones. This included advocating for &quot;educational and voluntary birth control measures&quot;—i.e., by separating groups and limiting excessive growth of failing groups. John Gillis argued in his biography of Cattell that, although some of Cattell&#x27;s views were controversial, Tucker and Mehler exaggerated and misrepresented his views by taking quotes out of context and referring to outdated writings. Gillis maintained that Cattell was not friends with white supremacists and described Hitler&#x27;s ideas as &quot;lunacy.&quot;

In 1997, Cattell was chosen by the American Psychological Association (APA) for its &quot;Gold Medal Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology.&quot; Before the medal was presented, Mehler launched a publicity campaign against Cattell through his nonprofit foundation ISAR, accusing Cattell of being sympathetic to racist and fascist ideas. Mehler claimed that &quot;it is unconscionable to honor this man whose work helps to dignify the most destructive political ideas of the twentieth century&quot;. A blue-ribbon committee was convened by the APA to investigate the legitimacy of the charges. Before the committee reached a decision, Cattell issued an open letter to the committee saying &quot;I believe in equal opportunity for all individuals, and I abhor racism and discrimination based on race. Any other belief would be antithetical to my life&#x27;s work&quot; and saying that &quot;it is unfortunate that the APA announcement ... has brought misguided critics&#x27; statements a great deal of publicity.&quot; Cattell refused the award, withdrawing his name from consideration, and the committee was disbanded. Cattell died months later at the age of 92.

In 1984, Cattell said that: &quot;The only reasonable thing is to be noncommittal on the race question – that&#x27;s not the central issue, and it would be a great mistake to be sidetracked into all the emotional upsets that go on in discussions of racial differences. We should be quite careful to dissociate eugenics from it – eugenics&#x27; real concern should be with individual differences.&quot; Richard L. Gorsuch (1997) wrote (in a letter to the American Psychological Foundation, para. 4) that: &quot;The charge of racism is 180 degrees off track. [Cattell] was the first one to challenge the racial bias in tests and to attempt to reduce that problem.&quot;

<text>Kriminalpolizei (, &quot;criminal police&quot;) is the standard term for the criminal investigation agency within the police forces of Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland. In Nazi Germany, the Kripo was the criminal police department for the entire Reich. Today, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the state police (&quot;Landespolizei&quot;) perform the majority of investigations. Its Criminal Investigation Department is known as the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; or more colloquially, the Kripo.

==Foundation==
In 1799, six police officers were assigned to the Prussian &quot;Kammergericht&quot; (superior court of justice) in Berlin to investigate more prominent crimes. They were given permission to work in plainclothes, when necessary. Their number increased in the following years.

In 1811, their rules of service were written into the &quot;Berliner Polizeireglement&quot; (Berlin Police Regulations), and in 1820, the rank of &quot;Kriminalkommissar&quot; was introduced for criminal investigators. In 1872, the new &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; was made a separate branch of police service distinguishing it from the uniformed police called &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot;.

Based on the experience with this new kind of police force, other German states—such as Bremen in 1852—reformed their police forces and by the end of the nineteenth century the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; had been established nationwide. During the early part of the 20th century and post-World War I, the Kripo continued to serve as the German state&#x27;s investigative agency for all criminal activity.

==Nazi Germany==

After Adolf Hitler assumed national power in January 1933, the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; came to be under the control of members of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The Nazis began a programme of &quot;coordination&quot; of all aspects of German life, in order to consolidate their hold on power. In July 1936, the Prussian central criminal investigation department &quot;(Landeskriminalpolizeiamt)&quot; became the central criminal investigation department for Germany, the &quot;Reichskriminalpolizeiamt&quot;. It was combined, along with the secret state police, the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Gestapo) into two sub-branch departments of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo). Reinhard Heydrich was in overall command of the SiPo. Arthur Nebe was appointed head of the &quot;Reichskriminalpolizeiamt&quot; and reported to Heydrich.

In September 1939, the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) was created as the overarching command organization for the various state investigation and security agencies. The SiPo was officially abolished and its departments were folded into the RSHA. The &quot;Reichskriminalpolizeiamt&quot; became Amt V (Department 5), the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Criminal Police) in the RSHA. Nebe was replaced as commander of the Kripo in August 1944 by Friedrich Panzinger.

The &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; were mostly plainclothes detectives and agents, and worked in conjunction with the Gestapo, the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo; uniformed police), and the &quot;Geheime Feldpolizei&quot; (secret military police). The Kripo was organized in a hierarchical system, with central offices in all towns and smaller cities. These, in turn, answered to headquarters offices in the larger German cities, which answered to Amt V of the RSHA in Berlin. The Kripo was mainly concerned with serious crimes such as rape, murder and arson. A main area of the group&#x27;s focus was also on &quot;blackout burglary,&quot; considered a serious problem during bombing raids when criminals would raid abandoned homes, shops and factories for valuables. The Kripo was one of the sources of manpower used to fill the ranks of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and several senior Kripo commanders, Arthur Nebe among them, were assigned as &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; commanders. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mobile death squad units perpetrated atrocities in the occupied Soviet Union, including mass murder of Jews, communists, prisoners of war, and hostages, and played a key role in the Holocaust.

==Post World War II==
In 1945, the occupying Allied Powers began their own programme of de-Nazification. It was understood that, in a totalitarian state, few people could participate in public service without also being members of the Nazi Party. Party membership alone was not viewed as sufficient grounds for dismissal, but allegations of involvement or complicity in Nazi war crimes or crimes against humanity were investigated and any police official convicted was sentenced in the usual way.

However, the Allied Powers felt the rule of law would be jeopardised by the mass-sacking of police officials who had served the Nazi state and that maintaining the continuity of a civilian and indigenous police force from the outset, together with all its accumulated practical skills and experience, was the most efficient way of restoring democracy to the German people. Thus the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; adapted once more to the changes in oversight and accountability and, as with other public servants, took the political and economic change of the post-war years in its stride.

Eastern Germany organised centralized Volkspolizei with Criminal Investigation Department (&quot;Hauptabteilung Kriminalpolizei&quot;).

==Present day==
The Federal Republic of Germany divides police responsibilities between federal and state authorities. The state police or &quot;Landespolizei&quot; of the federal states perform the majority of investigations in Germany.

Within the &quot;Landespolizei&quot;, the Criminal Investigation Department is known as the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; or Kripo. The various &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; departments are organized according to state law and report, ultimately, to the Interior Ministry of their state. As the vast majority of police work is performed at state level, the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; conducts most criminal investigations in Germany.

&quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; detectives investigate crimes and incidents and work in plainclothes. They collect evidence, interview victims and witnesses and question suspects. Detectives are also involved in the location of missing persons and the recovery of stolen property. Investigators may be assigned to precinct detective squads or one of dozens of specialized investigative units that have borough, citywide or regional jurisdiction.

Kripo candidates are mostly regular state police officers who have done well in police school and in their first years of street duty. After rigorous screening and examination, a small number are chosen to receive a technical education in criminology at a police college. Those completing the course then serve a three-year apprenticeship before attaining full status as an investigator.

Joint investigation teams are often formed with German Federal Police and customs investigators to combat drug smuggling or organised crime activities. Each state also has a state investigation bureau or &quot;Landeskriminalamt&quot;, generally located in the state capital, to assist the Kripo in cases that require specialist forensic or investigative resources.

German police departments have separate &quot;Staatsschutz&quot; departments within the Kripo to investigate politically motivated crime. German intelligence agencies have no executive police powers. Their operatives are not authorized to carry out arrests, searches of premises, interrogations or confiscations. If they establish that judicial or police measures are required, they hand the matter over to the courts, public prosecutors or Kripo state security (&quot;Staatsschutz&quot;) officers who decide independently what action is justified.

The &quot;Bundeskriminalamt&quot;, the German Federal Investigation Bureau, and the federal police, &quot;Bundespolizei&quot;, have their own investigators but these are not referred to as &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot;. It is technically possible to transfer from the federal police to the Kripo, but in practice there is little demand for this.

==Switzerland==
The responsibility for law and order in Switzerland basically lies with the cantons where the cantonal police (&quot;Kantonspolizei&quot;) are responsible for investigations. The Swiss federal structure is reflected in a number of cantonal police services which are organized in different ways, but in the German-speaking cantons, the criminal investigation departments are generally known as &quot;Kriminalpolizei.&quot;

<text>A feral pig is a domestic pig which has gone feral, meaning it lives in the wild. The term feral pig has also been applied to wild boars, which can interbreed with domestic pigs. They are found mostly in the Americas and Australia. Razorback and wild hog are sometimes used in the United States in reference to feral pigs or boar–pig hybrids.

==Definition==
A feral pig is a domestic pig that has escaped or been released into the wild, and is living more or less as a wild animal, or one that is descended from such animals. Zoologists generally exclude from the &quot;feral&quot; category animals that, although captive, were genuinely wild before they escaped. Accordingly, Eurasian wild boar, released or escaped into habitats where they are not native, such as in North America, are not generally considered feral, although they may interbreed with feral pigs. Likewise, reintroduced wild boars in Western Europe are also not considered feral, despite the fact that they were raised in captivity prior to their release.

==North America==
===Continental United States===
Domestic pigs were first introduced to the Americas in the 16th century. Christopher Columbus intentionally released domestic swine in the West Indies during his second voyage to provide future expeditions with a freely available food supply. Hernando de Soto is known to have introduced Eurasian domestic swine to Florida in 1539, though it is possible that Juan Ponce de León had already introduced the first pigs into mainland Florida in 1521.

The practice of introducing domestic pigs into the New World persisted throughout the exploration periods of the 16th and 17th centuries. The Eurasian wild boar (&quot;S. s. scrofa&quot;), which originally ranged from Great Britain to European Russia, may have also been introduced. By the 19th century, their numbers were sufficient in some areas such as the Southern United States to become a common game animal.

Feral pigs are a growing problem in the United States and also on the southern prairies in Canada. , the estimated population of 6million feral pigs causes billions of dollars in property and agricultural damage every year in the United States, both in wild and agricultural lands. Their ecological damage may be equally problematic with 26% lower vertebrate species richness in forest fragments they have invaded. Because pigs forage by rooting for their food under the ground with their snouts and tusks, a group of feral pigs can damage acres of planted fields in just a few nights. Due to the feral pig&#x27;s omnivorous nature, it is a danger to both plants and animals endemic to the area it is invading. Game animals such as deer and turkeys, and more specifically, flora such as the &quot;Opuntia&quot; plant have been especially affected by the feral hog&#x27;s aggressive competition for resources. Feral pigs have been determined to be potential hosts for at least 34 pathogens that can be transmitted to livestock, wildlife, and humans. For commercial pig farmers, great concern exists that some of the hogs could be a vector for swine fever to return to the U.S., which has been extinct in America since 1978. Feral pigs could also present an immediate threat to &quot;nonbiosecure&quot; domestic pig facilities because of their likeliness to harbor and spread pathogens, particularly the protozoan &quot;Sarcocystis&quot;.

By the early 2000s, the range of feral pigs included all of the U.S. south of 36°
north. The range begins in the mountains surrounding California and crosses over the mountains, continuing consistently much farther east towards the Louisiana bayous and forests, terminating in the entire Florida peninsula. In the East, the range expands northward to include most of the forested areas and swamps of the Southeast, and from there goes north along the Appalachian Mountains as far as upstate New York, with a growing presence in states bordering West Virginia and Kentucky. Texas has the largest estimated population of 2.5–2.6million feral pigs existing in 253 of its 254 counties, and they cause about $50million in agriculture damage per year.

====Hunting in the United States====


To control feral pig numbers, American hunters have taken to trapping and killing as many individuals as they can. Some, in Texas, have even turned the trapping and killing of razorbacks into small businesses. The meat of wild pigs may be suitable for human consumption; around 461,000 animals killed in Texas between 2004 and 2009 were federally inspected and commercially sold for consumption.

Legal restrictions on methods of hunting are lax, as most state departments of wildlife openly acknowledge feral pigs as an ecological threat and some classify them as vermin. For example, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers them unprotected wild animals with no closed season or harvest limit, and promotes their aggressive removal.

Shooting pigs from a helicopter is legal in Texas; called Heli-Hogging, and can be an effective method, killing as many as 9 to 27 animals per hour. Helicopters can cost from US$400 to US$1000 per hour to operate. These costs are defrayed by selling seats on these helicopter flights to recreational hunters; Texas law only requires that those buying a helicopter hunt be in possession of a hunting license. The method relies on the helicopter flushing pigs into the open where they can be targeted. In some areas, such as the Piney Woods, this may not be possible because of vegetation.

Hunting with dogs is permitted and very common; it has been practiced in the Southeast for generations. Competitions for producing the fastest bay dogs are prevalent in the South, with Uncle Earl&#x27;s Hog Dog Trials in Louisiana a popular example, held every summer since 1995. Preferred scent dogs for catching feral pigs mostly are native breeds, and include the Catahoula Leopard Dog, the Blue Lacy, the Leopard Hound, all six of the Coonhound breeds, and the Blackmouth Cur.

Catch dogs typically are American Pit Bull Terriers and their crosses, the Catahoula (dual purpose), the Dogo Argentino, a dog used for the same purpose in South America, and American Bulldogs; the first of these has been put back to work as a utility breed over the past 30 years and its tenacity on the hunt and undying loyalty to protect its master have made it a popular asset. The method of hunting has little variation: usually, the hunter sends out bay dogs trained to chase the pig until it tires and then corner it; then a bigger catch dog is sent out to catch and hold down the pig, which may get aggressive, until the hunter arrives to kill it.

No single management technique alone can be totally effective at controlling feral pig populations. Harvesting 66% of the total population per year is required to keep the Texas feral pig populations stable. Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20million on feral pig management.

In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents).

===Canada===

Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) have become an invasive species in Canada, particularly in western and central regions, following their introduction as livestock in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These animals are hybrid descendants of European wild boars and domestic pigs, and have developed unique adaptations to survive in Canada&#x27;s cold climate.

Canadian farmers began importing wild boars from Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s for meat production. Some of these animals escaped from farms by digging under or breaking through fences, while others were intentionally released when the boar meat market declined. Initially dismissed as a minor concern due to assumptions about their inability to survive Canadian winters, the population has since grown and spread significantly.

These hybrid pigs can reach weights of up to 600 pounds or more, substantially larger than their European counterparts which typically weigh 220 pounds. They possess several distinctive features:
*Sharp tusks
*Bristly coats with thick, warm fur
*High cold tolerance
*Large litter sizes (up to six piglets twice per year)
*Ability to construct &quot;pigloos&quot; - shelter structures made from cattails for winter protection 

Research conducted by the University of Saskatchewan has shown that feral pigs have spread throughout western and central Canada, from British Columbia to Manitoba. Their range has been expanding since their introduction, with significant population growth documented between 1990 and 2017.

== Hawaii ==
A genetic analysis found that the first pigs were introduced to Hawaii by Polynesians in approximately AD 1200. Additional varieties of European pigs were introduced after Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival into Hawaii in 1778, where they prey on or eat endangered birds and plants. The population of feral pigs has increased from 2 million pigs ranging over 20 states in 1990, to triple that number 25 years later, ranging over 38 states with new territories expanding north into Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Some of these feral pigs have mixed with escaped Russian boars that have been introduced for hunters since the early 1990s.

Feral pigs are opportunistic omnivores, with about 85%-90% of their diet being plant matter, and the remainder animal. Plants have difficulties regenerating from their wallowing, as North American flora did not evolve to withstand the destruction caused by rooting pigs, unlike European or Asian flora. Feral pigs in the U.S. eat small animals, mostly invertebrates like insects and worms but also vertebrates such as wild turkey poults, toads, tortoises, and the eggs of reptiles and birds. This can deprive other wildlife that normally would feed upon these important food sources.

In some case, other wildlife are out-competed by the feral pigs&#x27; higher reproductive rate; a sow can become pregnant as early as six months old and give birth to multiple litters of piglets yearly. In the autumn, other animals such as the American black bear compete directly with feral pigs as both forage for tree mast (the fruit of forest trees). These are likely reasons that they reduce diversity when they invade.

In the U.S., the problems caused by feral pigs are exacerbated by the small number of species which prey on them. Predators such as bobcats and coyotes may occasionally take feral piglets or weakened animals, but are not large enough to challenge a full-grown boar that can grow to three times their weight. In Florida, feral pigs made up a significant portion of the Florida panther&#x27;s diet. Other potential predators include the gray wolf, red wolf, cougar, jaguar, American alligator, American black bear, and grizzly bear. Unfortunately, each keystone predator presents problems: the jaguar is extirpated from California and the Southwest. The grizzly bear, while native to most of the American West, is gone from the states that have large feral pig populations, namely Texas, Arizona, California, and New Mexico; and the species also has a very slow reproductive rate. Wolf numbers are small and expected to remain so as they slowly repopulate their range; only a few individuals thus far have been recorded as inhabiting California, in spite of thousands of square miles of good habitat. The cougar is present in most of the West, but is gone from the East, with no known populations east of Minnesota in the north, and very thin numbers east of Houston in the South. The American black bear is both predator and competitor, but in most areas probably may not impact feral pig populations enough to control them. Programs do exist to protect the weakened numbers of large predators in the U.S., but it is expected to take a very long time for these animals to naturally repopulate their former habitat.

==South America==
In South America, during the early 20th century, free-ranging boars were introduced in Uruguay for hunting purposes and eventually crossed the border into Brazil in the 1990s, quickly becoming an invasive species. Licensed private hunting of both feral boars and their hybrids with domestic pigs was authorized from August 2005 on in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, although their presence as a pest had been already noticed by the press as early as 1994. Releases and escapes from unlicensed farms (established because of increased demand for boar meat as an alternative to pork) continued to bolster feral populations and, by mid-2008, licensed hunts had to be expanded to the states of Santa Catarina and São Paulo.

Recently established Brazilian boar populations are not to be confused with long-established populations of feral domestic pigs, which have existed mainly in the Pantanal for more than 100 years, along with native peccaries. The demographic dynamics of the interaction between feral pig populations and those of the two native species of peccaries (collared peccary and white-lipped peccary) is obscure and is still being studied. The existence of feral pigs could somewhat ease jaguar predation on peccary populations, as jaguars show a preference for hunting pigs when they are available.

==Australia==

The first recorded release of pigs in Australia was made by Captain James Cook at Adventure Bay, Bruny Island in 1777. This was part of his policy of introducing animals and plants to newly discovered countries. He &quot;carried them (a boar and sow) about a mile within the woods at the head of the bay and there left them by the side of a fresh water brook&quot;. The deliberate introduction of pigs into previously pig-free areas seems to have been common. As recently as the early 1970s, pigs were introduced to Babel Island, off the east coast of Flinders Island. These pigs were eradicated by Department of Agriculture staff with local assistance.

One common story about the feral pig population on Flinders Island is that pigs were released when the ship &quot;City of Foo Chow&quot; went ashore on the northeast coast of the island in March 1877. On Flinders Island, feral pigs usually invade agricultural areas adjacent to the national park and east-coast swamps. Farmers consider damage caused by the pigs to be minor, as it is restricted to rooting in pasture adjacent to scrubland edges. The total pasture area damaged each year is estimated to be less than 50 hectares. Feral pigs are reported to visit paddocks where ewes are lambing, but no lambs are reported as having been killed. As omnivores, they may scavenge any carcasses left near the scrubland, thus developing a potential &quot;taste&quot; for lamb or mutton. In the Strzelecki National Park on the island, the ecosystem has been severely damaged; extensive rooting in the gullies led to water erosion and loss of regenerating forest plants. Bracken fern (&quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot;) flourishes in this damaged environment and dominates large areas forming dense stands to about 4 m which prevent light reaching the forest floor.

Since 1987, feral pigs have been considered to be the most important mammalian pest of Australian agriculture. Feral pigs may be a new food source for crocodiles, helping to boost their population.

While no incidences of feral pigs killing newborn lambs have been recorded in Australia, the same cannot be said in nearby New Zealand, where feral pigs have been seen with some regularity in and around the island nation&#x27;s capital of Wellington. Here, they have been documented killing and consuming newborn/juvenile dairy goats kept on farms, separating the youngest goats from the rest of the herd; the feral pigs (which usually raid the farms by cover of darkness) will also threaten any guard dogs present into submission, in order to attack and eat the goat kids. As of September 2022, one single goat farm in the suburb of Brooklyn has estimated their total loss to feral hogs to be at least 60 kids. According to property co-owner Naomi Steenkamp, &quot;It&#x27;s a murder scene&quot;, with the morning revealing evidence of the previous night&#x27;s carnage—bone fragments, such as bits of hoof and skull, are often all that remain of the helpless young goats. Additionally, Steenkamp has stated that &quot;...If they [feral pigs] find something they like eating, and it is a free feed – like a newborn kid – they are going to keep coming back.&quot; The pigs also damage the nesting sites of New Zealand&#x27;s endemic wildlife, including kiwi and other ground-nesting and flightless birds, and may target chicks and eggs for food, as well as adult birds.

== Fatal attacks on human beings ==
Feral pigs can be dangerous to people, particularly when the pigs travel in herds with their young, and should be avoided when possible. Feral pigs living in the United States have been known to attack without provocation and fatally injure human beings. There have been over 100 documented attacks by feral pigs on human beings in the United States between the years 1825 and 2012. Of these attacks, five have been fatal. Three of the five fatal attacks were by feral pigs wounded by hunters. Both male and female feral pigs are known to attack without provocation, and attacks by solitary males, as well as group attacks have been documented.

On November 26, 2019, a 59-year-old Texas woman named Christine Rollins was attacked and killed only a few feet away from the front door of her workplace by a herd of feral pigs in the town of Anahuac, Texas, which is 50 miles east of Houston. This incident was the fifth documented fatal feral pig attack in the United States since 1825. Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne in a formal statement to news media stated that &quot;multiple hogs&quot; assaulted Rollins during pre-dawn hours between 6 and 6:30 a.m. when it was still dark outside. The victim died of blood loss as a result of her injuries.

<doc id="1145707" wikidata="Q1056508" url="?curid=1145707" title="Cervical collar">
<text>A cervical collar, also known as a neck brace, is a medical device used to support and immobilize a person&#x27;s neck. It is also applied by emergency personnel to those who have had traumatic head or neck injuries, although they should not be routinely used in prehospital care. They can also be used to treat chronic medical conditions.

Whenever people have a traumatic head or neck injury, they may have a cervical fracture. This makes them at high risk for spinal cord injury, which could be exacerbated by movement of the person and could lead to paralysis or death. A common scenario for this injury would be a person suspected of having whiplash because of a car accident. In order to prevent further injury, such people may have a collar placed by medical professionals until X-rays can be taken to determine if a cervical spine fracture exists. Medical professionals will often use the NEXUS criteria and/or the Canadian C-spine rules to clear a cervical collar and determine the need for imaging.

The routine use of a cervical collar is not recommended.

Cervical collars are also used therapeutically to help realign the spinal cord and relieve pain, although they are usually not worn for long periods of time. Another use of the cervical collar is for strains, sprains, or whiplash. If pain is persistent, the collar might be required to remain attached to help in the healing process. A person may also need a cervical collar, or may require a halo fixation device to support the neck during recovery after surgery such as cervical spinal fusion.

==Types==

A soft collar is fairly flexible and is the least limiting but can carry a high risk of further breakage, especially in people with osteoporosis. They are usually made of felt. It can be used for minor injuries or after healing has allowed the neck to become more stable.

A range of manufactured rigid collars are also used, usually comprising (a) a firm plastic bi-valved shell secured with Velcro straps and (b) removable padded liners. The also contain a back pad, back panel, front pad, front panel, and chin pad. There are air holes throughout the device to provide ventilation to the area but also to allow access for a tracheostomy if needed. The rigidness is provided by plexiglass in some models. The most frequently prescribed are the Aspen, Malibu, Miami J, and Philadelphia collars. All these can be used with additional chest and head extension pieces to increase stability.

Cervical collars are incorporated into rigid braces that constrain the head and chest together. Examples include the Sterno-Occipital Mandibular Immobilization Device (SOMI), Lerman Minerva and Yale types. Special cases, such as very young children or non-cooperative adults, are sometimes still immobilized in medical plaster of paris casts, such as the Minerva cast.

Rigid collars are most restrictive when flexing the neck and least restrictive with lateral rotation when compared to soft collars. Despite this, subjects have similar range of motion when asked to perform activities of daily living. It is thought that these collars provide a proprioceptive guide on how much to move one&#x27;s neck and when patients are preoccupied with performing an activity they are able to move their neck more. This is why in more minor injuries, cervical collars are still placed to remind patients of their injury so they can restrict any activities that may worsen their condition.

== Application and care ==
When applying a cervical collar, it must be tight enough to immobilize the neck but must be loose enough to avoid pressure on the vasculature of the neck, strangulation, and pressure ulcers. Ideally, any clothing or jewelry in the neck area should be removed before applying the collar. Next, a collar size must be chosen according to the patient&#x27;s size and build. The practitioner will then measure the length of the neck. The collar is then placed by one practitioner while the other holds the neck still. Then, the collar should be locked to the ideal neck length according to the specific manufacturer&#x27;s manual. The chin must be in the chin piece and the collar must extend down to the sternal notch. If the patient has a tracheostomy hole, medical professionals must assure that the hole is midline and accessible in a patient with a cervical collar. Some common errors include incorrect chosen collar size, incorrect technique in placing collar, and incorrect measurement of neck length. 

Cervical collars and patient&#x27;s necks should be evaluated and cleaned frequently for hygienic purposes as well as to avoid pressure ulcers. When the neck area is being cleaned, it is again important for two people to help remove the collar. One person must help hold the neck and keep it aligned while the other unfastens the straps and removes the collar. The area is then cleaned with soap, water, and washcloths. If there is evidence of skin breakdown, other topical agents and even antibiotics may be used if there is evidence of infection as well.
== History ==
The cervical collar was invented in 1966 by George Cottrell during the Vietnam war as a way to provide neck immobilization in American soldiers with potential unstable neck injuries. Its use in the prehospital setting in the United States was popularized by orthopedic surgeon, Dr. JD Farrington. In his paper, &quot;Death in a Ditch&quot;, Farrington described seeing &quot;sloppy and inefficient removal of victim[s] from their vehicle.&quot; He explained how a standardized approach of applying cervical collars before extracting motor vehicle collision victims from their vehicles is necessary to prevent this. 

==Use over time==
As a result of several small randomized clinical trials over the last decade, hospitals and ambulance staff have seen a significant reduction in the number of patients that are being immobilized. This has been due to complications such as increased intracranial pressure with traumatic brain injury, along with access issues for airway management in obtunded patients. Other risks and complications include increased testing and imaging, increased incidence in displacement of spinal fractures in the elderly, limited physical examination of patients, neck pain, pressure ulcers, and increased length in hospital stay. Because of these potential complications, cervical collars are not recommended in trauma patients with isolated penetrating injury and no neurological deficits. This is because the benefit of a potential secondary cervical injury being prevented with a cervical collar is much less than the risks associated with a cervical collar; with the most concerning being trouble accessing a patient&#x27;s airway. Some medical professionals have even been calling for a ban on cervical collars, stating that they cause more harm than good. There is also very little evidence that shows cervical collars to be actually making a difference in traumatic cervical spine injury.

== Other uses ==
Cervical collars are used much less commonly for things outside of cervical injury and precaution. These uses include cervical radiculopathy, sleep apnea, and patients on CPAP ventilation. Most studies for these conditions are small scale and limited.

In a 2009 study, it was shown that patients with a confirmed recent diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy who had a cervical collar applied had greater decrease in pain after 6 weeks compared to patients who did not have one applied. When these patients were followed up after six months, almost all of the subjects had complete or near complete resolution of any pain and/or disability, regardless if they had a cervical collar applied or not.

Sleep apnea can be worsened by anterior flexion of the neck or posterior movement of the mandible when sleeping supine. Cervical collars are used to prevent these movements when sleeping in these patients. Small scale studies have failed to show any improvement in oxygenation, snoring, and/or apneic episodes with the use of cervical collars at night. These patients can experience discomfort and feelings of strangulation at night if the collar is not fastened properly. Despite this, some practitioners still apply cervical collars for sleep apnea.

Patients on CPAP ventilation can often have suboptimal positioning due to pain, discomfort, or lack of knowledge. Similarly to patients with sleep apnea, patients on CPAP need optimization of their neck position to keep their airway clear of any obstruction. Specifically, posterior movement of the mandible is to be avoided as to not cause the strap of the CPAP to come off. Also, limited head movement while on CPAP is desired to optimize oxygen flow in and out of the device. Cervical soft collars are used to try to achieve both of these goals. In a small study analyzing the use of cervical collars in patients on CPAP ventilation with a history of sleep apnea, a significant benefit was observed.

==Sport==

In high-risk motorsports such as Motocross, go-kart racing and speed-boat racing, racers often wear a protective collar to avoid whiplash and other neck injuries.

Designs range from simple foam collars to complex composite devices.

<text>Duke of Nemours was a title in the Peerage of France. The name refers to Nemours in the Île-de-France region of north-central France.

==History==
In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Lordship of Nemours, in the Gatinais, France, was a possession of the house of Villebéon, a member of which, Gautier, was marshal of France in the middle of the 13th century. The lordship was sold to King Philip III of France in 1274 and 1276 by Jean and Philippe de Nemours. It was then made a county and given in 1364 to Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch.

In 1404, Charles VI of France gave it to Charles III of Navarre and elevated it into a duchy in the peerage of France, in exchange to his ancestral county of Évreux in Normandy.

After being confiscated and restored several times, the duchy reverted to the French crown in 1504, after the extinction of the house of Armagnac-Pardiac. In 1507, it was given by Louis XII of France to his nephew, Gaston de Foix, who was killed at the Battle of Ravenna in 1512.

The duchy then returned to the royal domain and was detached from it successively for Giuliano de Medici and his wife Philiberta of Savoy in 1515, for Louise of Savoy in 1524, and for Philip of Savoy, Count of Genevois, in 1528. The descendants of Philip of Savoy held the duchy until its sale to Louis XIV of France.

In 1672, Louis XIV gave it to his brother Philippe de France, Duke of Orléans, whose descendants held it until the French Revolution. It was one of the many subsidiary titles held by the House of Orléans. The title of Duke of Nemours was afterwards given to Louis Charles d&#x27;Orléans, the second son of King Louis Philippe of the French.

* Charles Philippe d&#x27;Orléans (1905–1970), great-grandson of the above

=== Potential claimants of the House of Orléans-Braganza ===
In 1909, members of the House of Orléans and the House of Orléans-Braganza signed the Pact of Brussels (also known as the Declaration of Brussels), the Duke of Orléans being present. The dynastic pact created the title of Prince of Orléans-Braganza for the Count d&#x27;Eu and his descendants, thus maintaining the princely status of his house, although this is considered a house distinct from the Royal House of France, and the Count d&#x27;Eu did not in fact recover his former position in the line of Orleans succession to the French throne.

Under the Pact of Brussels the Count d&#x27;Eu and his sons equally undertook in his name and the name of his descendants not to contest in any way to the branch of the Duke d&#x27;Alençon the possession of the title of Duke of Nemours.

Nevertheless, Charles Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, the last Duke of Nemours and only descendant of the Alençon, died without heirs. His death opened the theoretical possibility for the Head of the House of Orléans-Braganza to claim said title without violating the family pact.

<doc id="1145712" wikidata="Q7727339" url="?curid=1145712" title="The Confessor (album)">
<text>The Confessor is the seventh solo studio album by American rock musician Joe Walsh, released on May 21, 1985 by Warner Bros. Records, and Full Moon Records. It was produced by Grammy Award-winning producer and sound engineer Keith Olsen as well as Walsh himself. The album peaked at number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Album artwork==
The cover art for the album features the painting &quot;Zwei Männer in Betrachtung des Mondes&quot; (Two Men Contemplating the Moon), a famous work by the German nineteenth-century romantic landscape artist Caspar David Friedrich, with a grainy photograph of Walsh in behind. The back cover is another painting by Friedrich, &quot;Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer&quot; (Wanderer above the Sea of Fog).

==Composition==
The album includes a cover of Michael Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Rosewood Bitters,&quot; which got some FM airplay in the US; Walsh played slide guitar on the original recording which Stanley originally recorded. On this version instead he plays an electric guitar.
&quot;Slow Dancing&quot; is a song written by Loz Netto for Walsh. Netto was the guitarist in the English band Moon from the mid 1970s and the band Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears from the late 1970s.

A variety of styles are explored on this album, including elements of blues, pop, and even Caribbean music. The title song is more in the vein of progressive rock.

==Recording==
Walsh&#x27;s new girlfriend Stevie Nicks would get involved with the recording of this album, as her old friend Keith Olsen was hired to produce the album. The superimposed LA session stalwarts like Jim Keltner, Mike Porcaro, Waddy Wachtel, Randy Newman, Alan Pasqua and a lot of musicians Walsh had never worked with before were the musicians who played on the album. However, the only familiar face was Timothy B. Schmit (of the Eagles) who only recorded backing vocals.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, the album was poorly received by many critics but sold quite well. Guitar World critic Bruce Malamut wrote that the album is &quot;the apologia of a strictly raised mid-western episcopalian after living in rock and roll sin for ‘Fifteen Years’ on the road,&quot; and that &quot;The balance … is a sober retrospective from rock’s own Harpo Marx.&quot; Rolling Stone said that &quot;Walsh is trying to make the kind of record he used to make a decade ago, and the result is, well, out of date, sound &quot;[sic]&quot; like something out of a 1975 time capsule.&quot; Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic James Chrispell highly complimented the title track, but wrote of the album &quot;Joe Walsh just hasn&#x27;t been able to produce a complete album of great material, and The Confessor is no exception. The first half is dreck... Worthwhile for the title track alone.&quot;

==Live performances and Tour==
After the release of the album, Walsh toured again with Joe Vitale in Australia and in the US. In Australia the band was called Creatures from America. In the US they were the opening act on some gigs for Foreigner.

&quot;The Confessor&quot; and &quot;Good Man Down&quot; were the only tracks from this album which were performed live on that tour.

<text>John Graves Shedd (July 20, 1850October 22, 1926) was the second president, and chairman of the board, of Marshall Field &amp; Company.

==Biography==
Born on a New Hampshire farm on July 20, 1850, Shedd arrived in Chicago, Illinois in 1871 and began working as a stock clerk for Marshall Field. By 1901, he had worked his way up to a vice-presidency and took over as president upon Field&#x27;s death in 1906. Field himself described Shedd as &quot;the greatest merchant in the United States,&quot; and, indeed, under Shedd&#x27;s presidency Marshall Field &amp; Company became the largest store in Chicago and the largest wholesale and dry goods company in the world.

Shedd was a civic leader and founding member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, which continues to play an active role in the city&#x27;s efforts to maintain itself as a world-class metropolis. One of the Commercial Club&#x27;s most notable undertakings was the sponsorship of Edward Bennett and Daniel Burnham&#x27;s Plan of Chicago, which was released in 1909 and which to this day is considered to be one of the most important urban planning documents ever created.

One of Chicago&#x27;s major philanthropists, he contributed extensively to Chicago charities, universities and museums, and in the early 1920s he provided $3 million to build Chicago&#x27;s Shedd Aquarium, as a complement to The Field Museum (founded in 1893 as a part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and renamed in honor of Marshall Field in 1905) and The Art Institute of Chicago (whose current building was also a product of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition). Completed in 1930, the Shedd Aquarium remained the world&#x27;s largest aquarium for most of the century.

In 1920, Shedd provided the funds for the construction of the Shedd-Porter Memorial Library in Alstead, New Hampshire.

He died of appendicitis in Chicago on October 22, 1926. He was interred at Rosehill Mauseoleum in Rosehill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 2002, The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts, a community-based performing arts center and music school in Eugene, Oregon, was co-founded by one of his great-grandchildren.

With his wife, Mary Roanna (née Porter), they had daughters Helen Shedd Reed Keith and Laura Abbie Shedd Schweppe (? – 1937). Laura married Charles Hodgdon Schweppe (1881–1941) in 1913. His grandson John Shedd Reed was president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway from 1967 to 1986 as well as president of the Shedd Aquarium from 1984 to 1994.

<doc id="1145731" wikidata="Q1479025" url="?curid=1145731" title="Packard V-1650 Merlin">
<text>The Packard V-1650 Merlin is a version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine, produced under license in the United States by the Packard Motor Car Company. The engine was licensed to expand production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin for British use. The engine also filled a gap in the U.S. at a time when similarly powered American-made engines were not available.

The first V-1650s, with a one-stage supercharger, equivalent to the Merlin XX, were used in the P-40F Kittyhawk fighter and in Canadian-built Hawker Hurricanes. Later versions based on the Merlin 60 series included a more advanced two-stage supercharger for improved performance at high altitudes. It found its most notable application in the North American P-51 Mustang fighter, improving the aircraft&#x27;s performance so it could escort Allied heavy bombers from Britain to Germany and back.

==Design and development==
At the outbreak of World War Two, the British aviation industry expanded greatly. There was great need for the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine with shadow factories being established in Crewe, Manchester, and Glasgow. This was not enough to meet increasing demand with the British government looking to expand production using U.S. manufacturers. An agreement was reached between Rolls-Royce and the Packard Motor Car Company in September 1940 to manufacture the Merlin under license, with a $130,000,000 order being placed. The first Packard-built engine, designated V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.

The first American model was a version of the Mark XX, designated the V-1650-1 by the American military and the Packard Merlin 28 by the British. This engine used a single-stage, two-speed supercharger, the gear changing mechanism of which originally came from a French Farman patent license. The Merlin 28 was used for the Avro Lancaster bomber. The USAAF V-1650-1 version of this engine was used in the Curtiss P-40Fs. The initial Packard modifications to this engine changed the main crankshaft bearings from a copper-lead alloy to a silver-lead combination and featured indium plating. This had been developed by General Motors&#x27; Pontiac Division to prevent corrosion, which was possible with lubricating oils that were used at that time. The bearing coating also improved the break-in (running-in) and load-carrying abilities of the surface.

In answer to a request from the British Air Ministry for a high-altitude Merlin for the pressurised Wellington VI high-altitude bomber, a Rolls-Royce team under the direction of Stanley Hooker developed a Merlin with two-stage supercharging, which became the Merlin 60-series. The first 60-series engine ran in March 1941, and was first flown in July the same year. When only 63 examples of the otherwise-cancelled Wellington VI were produced, these engines were instead introduced on the Spitfire IX as the Merlin 61.

This model was later produced by Packard as the V-1650-3 and became known as the &quot;high altitude&quot; Merlin destined for the P-51, the first two-stage Merlin-Mustang conversion flying with a Merlin 65 as the Mustang X in October 1942, the production V-1650-3 engined P-51B (Mustang III) entering service in 1943. The two-speed, two-stage supercharger section of the two-stage Merlins and V-1650-3 featured two separate impellers on the same shaft that were normally driven through a gear train at a ratio of 6.391:1. A hydraulic gear change arrangement of oil-operated clutches could be engaged by an electric solenoid to increase this ratio to 8.095:1 in high speed blower position.

The high speed gear ratio of the impellers was not as high as the ratio used in the Allison, but impeller speed is not the only factor that determines engine performance, which is also a function of the size and pitch of the impeller blades. The gear-driven supercharger is a parasitic accessory; therefore, impeller gearing and blade profiles are carefully designed for maximum power at altitude without compromise of available power at the critical take off stage of flight. The double staging of the compressed fuel/air mixture provided the boost pressure through a diffuser to the intake manifolds that increased the critical altitude of the power plant.

The ability of the supercharger to maintain a sea level pressure in the induction system to the cylinders allowed the Packard Merlin to develop more than above . The two-stage impeller created extreme heating of the fuel/air mixture during the compression process, and, to prevent detonation of the compressed charge, it was necessary to cool the mixture prior to entry into the cylinders. The cooling was accomplished in an intercooler passage cast into the wheel case housing between the first and second-stage impellers and an additional cooling fin and tube core placed between the outlet of the blower and the induction manifold to the cylinders.
Ethylene glycol coolant was circulated by a pump through these to carry off the excess heat generated by the impellers. Without the intercooler the temperature increase in the charge could be as high as 205 °C (401 °F).. The glycol mixture used for cooling was independent of the main engine cooling system and used a centrifugal pump driven by the engine to circulate the coolant through an aircraft radiator system at a maximum rate of 36 U.S. gallons (136 litres, 30 Imperial gallons) per minute, depending on engine rpm. This combined system reduced the charge temperature to suitable levels.

Throttle valves in the updraft carburettor throat were controlled by an automatic boost control through the throttle linkage to maintain the selected manifold pressure with changes in altitude. The valves were only partially open during ground and low-level operation to prevent overboosting of the engine. As air density decreases with increased altitude, the throttle valves were progressively opened in response to the reducing atmospheric pressure. This system provided full power within engine boost limitations up to the critical altitude of .

===Measurement of boost pressure===
The British measured boost pressure as lbf/in2 (psi). The normal atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi, so a reading of +6 means that the air/fuel mix is being compressed by a supercharger blower to 20.7 psi before entering the engine; +25 means that the air/fuel mix is now being compressed to 39.7 psi.

The Americans measured their boost ratings using inches of mercury (inHg). One pound-force per square inch equals or , and a standard atmosphere is 101.325 kPa =29.92 inHg =14.70 lbf/in2. In early Merlin engines the maximum manifold (boost) pressure was +12 on 100 octane fuel. This was increased in later models.
===Postwar use===
In the United States many war surplus engines and airframes were sold relatively cheaply – two of the most popular items were North American P-51 Mustangs and Packard V-1650 Merlin engines, several of which were &quot;souped up&quot; and modified for air racing in the Bendix Trophy, the Cleveland Air Races, and the Thompson Trophy. Many of these engines remain heavily used to this day in Drag Racing, Hydroplane racing, and Land Speed Racing at places like the Bonneville Salt Flats. The Mynarski Lancaster flown by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, one of only two Lancasters flying in the world, uses four Packard Merlin engines.

Work continues on increasing the power output of the Merlin for the Unlimited Class racers at the Reno Air Races. Innovations, such as the use of Allison V-1710 connecting rods and the replacement of the intercooler with ADI (Anti-Detonation Injection) (50% Distilled Water and 50% Methanol), nearly identical in chemical composition to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s wartime MW 50 system, and similar to the water injection system used on Pratt &amp; Whitney engines during World War II, have allowed great increases in power output. Many of the fastest Unlimited racers increase Merlin manifold pressures as high as 145 inHg (56.6 psi, 4.8 atm) to obtain up to 2,835 kW (3,800 horsepower), achieving Mustang speeds up to 490 mph.

<doc id="1145733" wikidata="Q744737" url="?curid=1145733" title="BIBO stability">
<text>In signal processing, specifically control theory, bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stability is a form of stability for signals and systems that take inputs. If a system is BIBO stable, then the output will be bounded for every input to the system that is bounded.

A signal is bounded if there is a finite value formula_1 such that the signal magnitude never exceeds formula_2, that is
:For discrete-time signals: formula_3
:For continuous-time signals: formula_4

== Time-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems==
===Continuous-time necessary and sufficient condition===
For a continuous time linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the impulse response, formula_5 , be absolutely integrable, i.e., its L1 norm exists.

: formula_6

===Discrete-time sufficient condition===
For a discrete time LTI system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the impulse response be absolutely summable, i.e., its formula_7 norm exists.

:formula_8

====Proof of sufficiency====
Given a discrete time LTI system with impulse response formula_9 the relationship between the input formula_10 and the output formula_11 is

:formula_12

where formula_13 denotes convolution. Then it follows by the definition of convolution

:formula_14

Let formula_15 be the maximum value of formula_16, i.e., the formula_17-norm.

:formula_18

::formula_19 (by the triangle inequality)

: formula_20

If formula_21 is absolutely summable, then formula_22 and

:formula_23

So if formula_21 is absolutely summable and formula_25 is bounded, then formula_26 is bounded as well because formula_27.

The proof for continuous-time follows the same arguments.

== Frequency-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems==
=== Continuous-time signals ===

For a rational and continuous-time system, the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the Laplace transform includes the imaginary axis. When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region to the right of a vertical line whose abscissa is the real part of the &quot;largest pole&quot;, or the pole that has the greatest real part of any pole in the system. The real part of the largest pole defining the ROC is called the abscissa of convergence. Therefore, all poles of the system must be in the strict left half of the s-plane for BIBO stability.

This stability condition can be derived from the above time-domain condition as follows:

:formula_28

where formula_29 and formula_30

The region of convergence must therefore include the imaginary axis.

=== Discrete-time signals ===

For a rational and discrete time system, the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the z-transform includes the unit circle. When the system is causal, the ROC is the open region outside a circle whose radius is the magnitude of the pole with largest magnitude. Therefore, all poles of the system must be inside the unit circle in the z-plane for BIBO stability.

This stability condition can be derived in a similar fashion to the continuous-time derivation:

:formula_31

where formula_32 and formula_33.

The region of convergence must therefore include the unit circle.

<doc id="1145738" wikidata="Q1758994" url="?curid=1145738" title="Kendrick extrication device">
<text>A Kendrick extrication device (KED) is a device used in extrication of victims of traffic collisions from motor vehicles. Commonly carried on ambulances, a KED is typically used by an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or another first responder. It was originally designed for extrication of race car drivers. Typically used in conjunction with a cervical collar, a KED is a semi-rigid brace that secures the head, neck and torso in an anatomically neutral position. Its use is claimed to reduce the possibility of additional injuries to these regions during extrication, although its value has been questioned, as there is a lack of evidence to support its use. The original KED was designed by Richard Kendrick in 1978.

==Description==
Typically there are two head straps, three torso straps, and two legs straps which are used to adequately secure the KED to the victim. Unlike a long spine board or litter, the KED uses a series of wooden or polymer bars in a nylon jacket, allowing the responders to immobilize the neck and upper spine and remove the victim from the vehicle or other confined space. Although a KED can also be used to immobilize infants and children, it is preferable to use specifically designed pediatric immobilization devices whenever possible. If a KED is used to immobilize an infant or child, appropriate padding must be used to ensure complete immobilization in a manner that does not obscure the thorax and abdomen, thereby preventing continued assessment of these vital areas.

==Application==
The device can be quickly and easily inserted into the seat of a vehicle by a single rescuer, allows access to the airway and conforms to any body size. A KED is typically used only on hemodynamically stable victims; unstable victims are extricated using rapid extrication techniques without the prior application of the KED.

Once the KED is slid into position, it is secured to the victim with straps in order to prevent movement. The first strap that is secured is the middle torso strap. According to the KED users&#x27; manual securing this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device. Next the bottom torso strap is secured, however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board. This is to allow the patient to breathe easily while the rest of the device is secured. Following the bottom torso strap the leg straps are secured. These may be applied in a &quot;criss-cross&quot; fashion (according to the KED users&#x27; manual this is the most commonly used method), or applied by securing them to their respective sides. If there is any evidence of a groin injury the &quot;criss-cross&quot; method cannot be used. Following application of the leg straps the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured. Finally, just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured. Some schools teach this order by remembering phrases such as &quot;My Baby Looks Hot Tonight&quot;, where the beginning of each word stands for Middle torso strap, Bottom torso strap, Leg straps, Head strap and Top torso strap.

The head pad can bring the head too far forward for the side panels to fully immobilize it. Care must be taken to secure the head properly to maintain neutral immobilization. If the head is too far forward, the head is brought back to meet the KED unless crepitus, pain or resistance is met. If these symptoms are present, the head is immobilized in the position found.

There has been debate surrounding the exact order of applying the torso straps, with some saying that the order does not matter as long as the torso is secured before the head. The KED users&#x27; manual is sometimes used in these debates: it states the reason the top strap is last is a function of breathing and not the process of immobilization itself.

==Value==
There is controversy about whether the use of a KED is actually appropriate in prehospital care. A 2015 article in the &quot;Journal of Paramedic Practice&quot; said that although the device has been used since the 1970s, its &quot;overall appropriateness in patient care should be viewed with caution&quot; and there is a &quot;lack of evidence to support its use&quot;. A 1988 article in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; said the device had &quot;yet to be evaluated for its immobilization of the cervical spine&quot; and that &quot;the role and performance of the device in transferring patients by road or air ... must be addressed&quot;.

==Rapid extrication without a KED==
During rapid extrication, the patient is not immobilized by a KED, but rather taken directly out of the car onto a back board. Reasons for using this technique include:
*The scene is unsafe
*The patient&#x27;s condition is unstable
*The patient is blocking access to another victim.

<doc id="1145746" wikidata="Q5587653" url="?curid=1145746" title="Got Any Gum?">
<text>Got Any Gum? is the eighth solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter Joe Walsh. It was originally released in October 1987, on the label Warner Brothers in the United States, and Full Moon in the UK, which was the last Walsh album to be released by either of those labels. The album features eight original songs which were written by Walsh with others and by himself, the album also features two covers, including the song &quot;In My Car&quot;, which was co-written by Walsh with Ringo Starr, the former drummer for The Beatles (the song was originally released on Starr&#x27;s ninth studio solo album &quot;Old Wave&quot;, in 1983). The album also features vocal contributions from JD Souther and Survivor&#x27;s lead vocalist Jimi Jamison.

The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. It was also a commercial disappointment, peaking at #113 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which marked the beginning of a downturn in Walsh&#x27;s fortunes on the album charts, and ultimately led to both Warner Bros. and Full Moon dropping him from their labels. Two singles were issued from &quot;Got Any Gum?&quot;: &quot;The Radio Song&quot; and &quot;In My Car&quot;. The album&#x27;s first and leading single, &quot;The Radio Song,&quot; unlike the album, was a commercial success, peaking at No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Its music video featured the legendary DJ Wolfman Jack.

==Album title==
In an interview with Howard Stern in October 1987, Walsh, while intoxicated, was asked about whether the album&#x27;s title had a background, to which Walsh immediately responded &quot;Yeah, a bum!, I saw a bum about a block away and I knew he was going to ask me for spare change, so I reach in - I&#x27;m all ready but he gets up to me and I say here, help yourself&quot;. He says &quot;I don&#x27;t need money, ya got any gum?&quot;

==Production and recording==

Following the tepid reaction to his 1985 studio album &quot;The Confessor&quot;, Joe Walsh decided that it was time for a change of pace in his solo career. In an attempt to give his music an even more contemporary sound, he joined forces with Terry Manning as the right person to produce his new album. Manning made the list of personnel to be featured on the album, but the only other musician that Walsh knew before this time was JD Souther, who arranged and provided backing vocals. Beginning in early 1987, Walsh began recording &quot;Got Any Gum?&quot;, having written eight new songs with others and by himself, at Ardent Recordings and Alpha Sound, in Memphis, Tennessee.

During the making of this album, the former Barnstorm drummer, Joe Vitale introduced the prolific session musician Rick Rosas to Walsh and they became quite good friends. Under the tongue-in-cheek pseudonym &quot;Rick the Bass Player&quot;, Rosas played bass guitar on the fifth track, &quot;Half of the Time&quot;. After the album was finished, Rosas and Walsh went on to tour and record together, including work on three of his last solo albums, &quot;Ordinary Average Guy&quot;, &quot;Songs for a Dying Planet&quot;, and the most recent &quot;Analog Man&quot;.

==Cover artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover photograph, which was taken by Carole Manning, is of the Memphian Theater, which first opened in 1935. In 1985, two years before the release of this album, the Memphian Theater was closed. It later became the venue for live theatre troupe &quot;Circuit Playhouse&quot;, from which it currently takes its name. The theater is possibly best known as one of the favorite hangouts for Elvis Presley, who often rented the theater to watch the latest films with his friends and fans.

The album&#x27;s back cover depicts Walsh in front of a vintage car, 1962 Ford Thunderbird while blowing up a big bubble, with gum. The album&#x27;s inner sleeve photography depicts Walsh with bubble gum popped on the outside of his face while grinning. The back cover also includes a dedication to Walsh&#x27;s daughter Lucy, who is also the niece of Ringo Starr.

==Critical reception==

James Chrispell of AllMusic retrospectively gave the album two out of five stars and wrote that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing sadder than seeing a talented artist come up with a real bummer, but that&#x27;s just what this record is.&quot; adding that &quot;Perhaps this is one of those contractual obligation albums you hear so much about.&quot; iTunes has given the album a positive review, writing, &quot;&quot;Got Any Gum?&quot; has been widely misunderstood, mostly because it bears little resemblance to his beloved &#x27;70s output,&quot; also noting it &quot;had spawned its own genre of decadent, heart-pumping pop-rock music.&quot;

<text>Der Standard () is an Austrian daily newspaper published in Vienna. It is considered a newspaper of record for Austria.

==History and profile==
&quot;Der Standard&quot; was founded by Oscar Bronner as a financial newspaper and published its first edition on 19 October 1988. German media company Axel Springer acquired a stake in the paper in 1988 and sold it in 1995.

Bronner remains the paper&#x27;s publisher, Gerold Riedmann is editor-in-chief. &quot;Der Standard&quot; sees itself as—in a Continental European sense (socially and culturally, but not economically)—liberal and independent. Third parties have described the paper as having a left-liberal stance. Until 2007, the editor-in-chief of the daily was Gerfried Sperl, Alexandra Föderl-Schmid succeeded him in the post.

In 2002 the paper was one of four quality daily newspapers with nationwide distribution along with &quot;Salzburger Nachrichten&quot;, &quot;Die Presse&quot;, and &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot;. Although &quot;Der Standard&quot; is intended to be a national paper, in the past it had an undeniable tendency to focus on Vienna. This has been mitigated by having editorial offices in other federal states (currently Styria, Upper Austria and Carinthia) and the introduction of regional sections. &quot;Der Standard&quot; is a paper from which foreign media readily quote when an opinion from the Austrian press is required. It is one of Austria&#x27;s best-selling quality newspapers and on 18 June 2005 celebrated its 5000th edition.

&quot;Der Standard&quot; is published in accordance with the &quot;honour code&quot; of the Austrian press (which sets rules on matters such as a transparent division between news and comment and the right to privacy). The paper&#x27;s general editorial stance could be described as socially liberal and most of its regular columnists also tend to this position, although guest writers come from a wide variety of political positions. As a participant in Project Syndicate &quot;Der Standard&quot; also regularly publishes commentary from individuals with an international reputation, whose work has worldwide distribution as part of this project.

&quot;Der Standard&quot; is published by the Standard Verlagsgesellschaft m. b. H. In August 2008, the newly created Bronner Online AG bought 49% of the shares of this company, which Süddeutscher Verlag previously owned. The Bronner Family Foundation has long owned 41% of the shares, and Oskar Bronner himself owns the remaining 10%. Süddeutscher Verlag had bought into the company in December 1998; previously, between 1988 and April 1995, Axel Springer Verlag had owned 50% of the shares.

Since 2005, the paper has cooperated with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and has published &quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot; on Mondays, which is a six-page supplement, featuring select articles from &quot;the Times&quot; in English. &quot;Der Standard&quot; participates in Atomium Culture, the Permanent Platform for European Excellence that brings together some of the most authoritative European universities, newspapers and businesses to increase the movement of knowledge: across borders, across sectors and to the public at large.

According to the 2007 Austrian Media Analysis, &quot;Der Standard&quot; has 352,000 readers in Austria, a 5% share of all readers. With a share of 19.4%, the paper is the most widely read newspaper among people with college or university education. A full online edition (&quot;Der Standard digital&quot;) is available as an e-paper on a subscription-basis.

==Circulation==
The circulation of &quot;Der Standard&quot; was 104,000 copies in 2002. In 2004 its circulation was 106,000 copies.

The paper had a circulation of 118,000 copies in 2007. The circulation of the paper was 117,131 copies in 2008 and 108,772 copies in 2009. It was 104,004 copies in 2010. The paper had a circulation of 72,693 copies in 2011. The circulation of the paper was about 86,000 copies in 2013.

==derStandard.at==
&quot;Der Standard&quot; has run its own web portal—derStandard.at—since February 1995 and claims this was the first appearance of a German-language newspaper on the web. In Q4 of 2011, according to &quot;Die Österreichische Webanalyse&quot;, derstandard.at had a readership of 1,135,000 unique users (2,379,231 unique clients in December 2011) and is consequently one of the largest and most wide-ranging web portals in Austria. Articles published online can be commented on by registered users. The portal diestandard.at publishes articles on women&#x27;s issues and feminism. In 2011, derStandard.at yielded a higher profit than the print edition of &quot;Der Standard&quot;.

In June 2019, &quot;derStandard.at&quot; underwent its first major relaunch in almost 19 years, updating the site&#x27;s design for the first time since September 2000 and introducing up-to-date technologies under the hood.

<text>Geophilic means soil loving or preferring the soil. This term is usually used when referring to certain types of fungi or molds that live in the soil. Many of these organisms are usually recovered from the soil but occasionally infect humans and animals. They cause a marked inflammatory reaction, which limits the spread of the infection and may lead to a spontaneous cure but may also leave scars.

Can also refer to someone who loves the earth, sustainability, or “green” initiatives. An individual with these tendencies may be referred to as a &quot;geophile.&quot;

<text>The tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed to assist in summarizing information stored on punched cards. Invented by Herman Hollerith, the machine was developed to help process data for the 1890 U.S. Census. Later models were widely used for business applications such as accounting and inventory control. It spawned a class of machines, known as unit record equipment, and the data processing industry. 

The term &quot;Super Computing&quot; was used by the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper in 1931 to refer to a large custom-built tabulator that IBM made for Columbia University. 

==1890 census==
The 1880 census had taken eight years to process. Since the U.S. Constitution mandates a census every ten years to apportion both congressional representatives and direct taxes among the states, a combination of larger staff and faster-recording systems was required.

In the late 1880s Herman Hollerith, inspired by conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details such as gender and approximate age, invented the recording of data on a machine-readable medium. Prior uses of machine-readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms. &quot;After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards...&quot; Hollerith used punched cards with round holes, 12 rows, and 24 columns. The cards measured . His tabulator used electromechanical solenoids to increment mechanical counters. A set of spring-loaded wires were suspended over the card reader. The card sat over pools of mercury, pools corresponding to the possible hole positions in the card. When the wires were pressed onto the card, punched holes allowed wires to dip into the mercury pools, making an electrical contact that could be used for counting, sorting, and setting off a bell to let the operator know the card had been read. The tabulator had 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count of up to 9,999. During a given tabulating run, counters could be assigned to a specific hole or, by using relay logic, to a combination of holes, e.g. to count married couples. If the card was to be sorted, a compartment lid of the sorting box would open for storage of the card, the choice of compartment depending on the data in the card.

Hollerith&#x27;s method was used for the 1890 census. Clerks used keypunches to punch holes in the cards entering age, state of residence, gender, and other information from the returns. Some 100 million cards were generated and &quot;the cards were only passed through the machines four times during the whole of the operations.&quot; According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the census results were &quot;... finished months ahead of schedule and far under budget.&quot;

==Following the 1890 census==
The advantages of the technology were immediately apparent for accounting and tracking inventory. Hollerith started his own business as &quot;The Hollerith Electric Tabulating System&quot;, specializing in punched card data processing equipment. In 1896 he incorporated the Tabulating Machine Company. In that year he introduced the Hollerith Integrating Tabulator, which could add numbers coded on punched cards, not just count the number of holes. Punched cards were still read manually using the pins and mercury pool reader. 1900 saw the Hollerith Automatic Feed Tabulator used in that year&#x27;s U.S. census. A control panel was incorporated in the 1906 Type 1. 

In 1911, four corporations, including Hollerith&#x27;s firm, were amalgamated (via stock acquisition) to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). The Powers Accounting Machine Company was formed that same year and, like Hollerith, with machines first developed at the Census Bureau. In 1919 the first Bull tabulator prototype was developed. Tabulators that could print, and with removable control panels, appeared in the 1920s. In 1924 CTR was renamed International Business Machines (IBM). In 1927 Remington Rand acquired the Powers Accounting Machine Company. In 1933 The Tabulating Machine Company was subsumed into IBM. These companies continued to develop faster and more sophisticated tabulators, culminating in tabulators such as 1949 IBM 407 and 1952 Remington Rand 409. Tabulating machines continued to be used well after the introduction of commercial electronic computers in the 1950s.

Many applications using unit record tabulators were migrated to computers such as the IBM 1401. Two programming languages, FARGO and RPG, were created to aid this migration. Since tabulator control panels were based on the machine cycle, both FARGO and RPG emulated the notion of the machine cycle and training material showed the control panel vs. programming language coding sheet relationships.

==Operation==


In its basic form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print portions (fields) of the card on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card to one or more counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card, and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next master card was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected to the top of the next page, typically using a carriage control tape.

With successive stages or cycles of punched-card processing, fairly complex calculations could be made if one had a sufficient set of equipment. (In modern data processing terms, one can think of each stage as an SQL clause: SELECT (filter columns), then WHERE (filter cards, or &quot;rows&quot;), then maybe a GROUP BY for totals and counts, then a SORT BY; and then perhaps feed those back to another set of SELECT and WHERE cycles again if needed.) A human operator had to retrieve, load, and store the various card decks at each stage.

==Selected models and timeline==

Hollerith&#x27;s first tabulators were used to compile mortality statistics for Baltimore, Jersey City and New York City in 1886.

The first Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) automatic feed tabulator, operating at 150 cards/minute, was developed in 1906.

The first TMC printing tabulator was developed in 1920.

TMC Type IV Accounting Machine (later renamed the IBM 301), from the IBM Archives:
The 301 (better known as the &quot;Type IV&quot;) Accounting Machine was the first card-controlled machine to incorporate class selection, automatic subtraction, and printing of a net positive or negative balance. Dating to 1928, this machine exemplifies the transition from tabulating to accounting machines. The Type IV could list 100 cards per minute.

H.W.Egli - BULL Tabulator model T30, 1931

IBM 401: The 401, introduced in 1933, was an early entry in a long series of IBM alphabetic tabulators and accounting machines. It was developed by a team headed by J. R. Peirce and incorporated significant functions and features invented by A. W. Mills, F. J. Furman and E. J. Rabenda. The 401 added at a speed of 150 cards per minute and listed alphanumerical data at 80 cards per minute.

IBM 405: Introduced in 1934, the 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine was the basic bookkeeping and accounting machine marketed by IBM for many years. Important features were expanded adding capacity, greater flexibility of counter grouping, direct printing of the entire alphabet, direct subtraction and printing of either debit or credit balance from any counter. Commonly called the 405 &quot;tabulator,&quot; this machine remained the flagship of IBM&#x27;s product line until after World War II. The British at Hut 8 used Hollerith machinery to gain some knowledge of Known-plaintext attack cribs used by encrypted German messages.

IBM 402 and 403, from 1948, were modernized successors to the 405.

The 1952 Bull Gamma 3 could be attached to this tabulator or to a card read/punch.

IBM 407Introduced in 1949, the 407 was the mainstay of the IBM unit record product line for almost three decades. It was later adapted to serve as an input/output peripheral for several early electronic calculators and computers. Its printing mechanism was used in the IBM 716 line printer for the IBM 700/7000 series and later with the IBM 1130 through the mid-1970s.
The IBM 407 Accounting Machine was withdrawn from marketing in 1976, signaling the end of the unit record era.

Watson collaborated with the Nazis to identify Jews, locate them, determine what personal effects they owned, what businesses they controlled, their real estate, and anything else of value that could be seized by the Nazis. IBM tabulators also made it possible to move millions of Jews to their deaths in concentration camps using hundreds of thousands of rail cars and tons of coal in a process that would have been impossible without IBM. All the concentration camps contained offices specifically for the running and repair of the IBM tabulators which kept track of the age, gender and manner of death of every inmate. These machines, as well as other used by the German military, were leased to the Nazis in what became millions of dollars of profit for IBM.

<text>Potter Palmer (May 20, 1826 – May 4, 1902) was an American businessman who was responsible for much of the development of State Street in Chicago. Born in Albany County, New York, he was the fourth son of Benjamin and Rebecca (Potter) Palmer.

==Retailing career==
Potter Palmer founded a dry goods store, Potter Palmer and Company, on Lake Street in Chicago in 1852. Unlike many stores of the time it focused on women and encouraged their patronage. Palmer instituted a &quot;no questions asked&quot; returns policy and allowed customers to take goods home to inspect before purchasing, which served to nurture the goodwill and patronage of Chicagoans. He made the store much larger and more distinctive than other stores of the time. Palmer was the first owner to advertise with large window displays that included price comparisons.

When Palmer&#x27;s doctor urged him to get out of the business in 1865 because of ill health, he brought in partners Marshall Field and Levi Leiter. The trio joined forces and renamed the firm Field, Palmer, Leiter and Company. The store would eventually develop into the prominent Midwestern department store chain Marshall Field and Company.

==Real estate career==

In 1865, Palmer went to his doctor complaining of being overworked and stressed. His doctor advised him to retire from actively managing his store at the age of 38. In 1867, Palmer sold his share of the partnership and went on vacation in Europe for three years before returning to Chicago to focus his efforts on his real estate interests, leasing a new building to his former partners in 1868 at State and Washington. He built several buildings along State Street &quot;on three-fourths of a mile frontage,&quot; including the Palmer House Hotel. When his buildings were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire, Palmer borrowed $1.7 million to rebuild, the largest amount lent to a private individual up to that time. He reclaimed the swampland north of Chicago&#x27;s commercial district, developing it into Lake Shore Drive. Potter Palmer also moved the city&#x27;s main commercial district from Lake Street, which ran east and west, to State Street, which ran north and south, parallel with the lake the way Chicago&#x27;s downtown is currently oriented. Potter Palmer is also responsible for widening State Street.

==Personal life==
In 1871, he married Bertha Honoré. In 1874 a son, Honoré, was born; in 1875, Potter Palmer II. Both went on to have sons named Potter Palmer III, as well as other children.

In 1885 Palmer built the castle-like Palmer Mansion on Lake Shore Drive, leading to the establishment of the Gold Coast. Prior to that time, Prairie Avenue had been the most desirable address in Chicago.

Palmer is buried in Graceland Cemetery in the north side neighborhood known today as Uptown, Chicago.

<text>Österreich 1 (Ö1) is an Austrian radio station: one of the four national channels operated by Austria&#x27;s public broadcaster ORF. It focuses on classical music and opera, jazz, documentaries and features, news, radio plays and dramas, &quot;Kabarett&quot;, quiz shows, and discussions.

==History==

The channel was launched on 1 October 1967 as part of an exercise which saw the ORF&#x27;s radio output reorganized into three numbered services, the other two being the regional stations grouped as Ö2 and the pop music channel Ö3.

Earlier, in 1964, there had been a petition for a national referendum, whereby more than 800,000 citizens declared themselves against ideological appointments of key positions within the public broadcasting service by the Austrian grand coalition government of Chancellor Alfons Gorbach (ÖVP) and Vice-Chancellor Bruno Pittermann (SPÖ) according to the Austrian &quot;Proporz&quot; system. Two years later, a legal regulation of a nonpartisan broadcasting was passed by the National Council parliament, entailing a relaunch of the ORF radio stations.

Ö1 was designated to comply with the public educational mandate (&quot;Bildungsauftrag&quot;) and to offer a broadly cultural program for an artistically inclined audience. One focus is on news broadcasts like the one-hour &quot;Mittagsjournal&quot; (&quot;Noon Journal&quot;) and &quot;Morgenjournal&quot; (&quot;Morning Journal&quot;), launched in the course of the coverage of the 1968 Prague Spring. Beside established programmes such as &quot;Du holde Kunst&quot;, first aired in 1945, Ö1 since the 1970s has also broadcast radio documentaries (&quot;Hörbilder&quot;), music programmes beyond the strictly classical canon (&quot;Pasticcio&quot;, &quot;Spielräume&quot;), and several recurring reports on everyday life in a feuilleton style like &quot;Der Schalldämpfer&quot; by Axel Corti (discontinued upon his death in 1993). Similar to other classical music radio stations, Ö1 has to bear with the tension between an elitist &quot;&quot;Hofrat&quot; widow broadcaster&quot; and a &quot;Classic FM&quot; popularisation, with the station&#x27;s style and scheduling a matter of ongoing debates.

==Operation==

After having broadcast from Funkhaus Wien on Argentinierstrasse in the Wieden district of Vienna for decades, the station moved to the ORF-Zentrum at Küniglberg in the Hietzing district in late 2022. The current station identification was composed by the jazz musician Werner Pirchner in 1994, the slogan &quot;Ö1 gehört gehört&quot;—a pun on &quot;to be heard&quot; in German conforming with &quot;ought to&quot;—was created by the author Wolf Haas. The interval signal of Ö1 is a three-note chord, played on a viola. There were two earlier versions of the signal: first one was played by harpsichord and the second one by a synth.

Since 2010 a 75-minute altered block of programming is broadcast every morning on the shortwave frequencies of former Radio Österreich International as Ö1 International. Ö1 internet radio can also be listened to live on the ORF website through streaming audio, the programmes can also be heard for a week after broadcast at no charge. Several are available as downloads and podcasts.

Ö1 runs the RadioKulturhaus venue in Funkhaus Wien including the KulturCafé coffee house. It also participates in the annual Donauinselfest music festival.

<doc id="1145758" wikidata="Q295323" url="?curid=1145758" title="Thomas Coryat">
<text>Thomas Coryat (also Coryate) (c. 15771617) was an English traveller and writer of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age. He is principally remembered for two volumes of writings he left regarding his travels, often on foot, through Europe and parts of Asia. He is often credited with introducing the table fork to England, with &quot;Furcifer&quot; (Latin: fork-bearer, rascal) becoming one of his nicknames. His description of how the Italians shielded themselves from the sun resulted in the word &quot;umbrella&quot; being introduced into English.

==Life and writings==

Coryat was born in Crewkerne, Somerset, and lived most of his life in the Somerset village of Odcombe. He was a son of George Coryate (died 1607). He was educated at Winchester College from 1591, and at Gloucester Hall, Oxford from 1596 to 1599. He was employed by Prince Henry, eldest son of James I as a sort of &quot;court jester&quot; from 1603 to 1607, alongside Ben Jonson, John Donne and Inigo Jones.

From May to October 1608 he undertook a tour of Europe, somewhat less than half of which he walked. He travelled through France and Italy to Venice, and returned via Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. He published his memoirs of the events in a volume entitled &quot;Coryat&#x27;s Crudities hastily gobbled up in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &amp;c&quot; (1611). This volume gives a vivid picture of life in Europe during the time.

The work is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe, including an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others. In 1611 he published a second volume of travel writings, this one entitled &quot;Coryats Crambe, or his Coleworte twice Sodden.&quot; Coryat&#x27;s letters from this time refer to the famous Mermaid Tavern in London, and mention Ben Jonson, John Donne and other members of a drinking club named the &quot;Fraternity of Sireniacal Gentlemen&quot; that met there.

Ever restless, he set out once again in 1612, this time on a journey that would ultimately lead to Asia, visiting Greece, the eastern Mediterranean including Constantinople by 1614, and walking through Turkey, Persia and eventually Moghul India by 1615, visiting the Emperor Jahangir&#x27;s court in Ajmer, Rajasthan. From Agra and elsewhere he sent letters describing his experiences; his &quot;Greetings from the Court of the Great Mogul&quot; was published in London in 1616, and a similar volume of his letters home appeared posthumously in 1618. In September 1617, at the invitation of Sir Thomas Roe, he visited the imperial court at Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. In November 1617 he left for Surat; he died of dysentery there in December of that year, his demise hastened by the consumption of sack. Though his planned account of the journey was never to be, some of his unorganized travel notes have survived and found their way back to England. These were published in the 1625 edition of Samuel Purchas&#x27;s Coryat&#x27;s writings were hugely popular at the time. His accounts of inscriptions, many of which are now lost, were valuable; and his accounts of Italian customs and manners—including the use of the table fork—were influential in England at a time when other aspects of Italian culture, such as the madrigal, had already been in vogue for more than twenty years. He is considered by many to have been the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe; a practice which became a mainstay of the education of upper class Englishmen in the 18th century.

==Tomb==

The place of his tomb is uncertain. As there was no regular English cemetery at Surat then, his body was buried north of the town on the western side of road leading to Bharuch. Another traveller, Terry, noted that his body was buried at Swally (Suvali), where other English people are also buried, but this account is not reliable, for it was written 40 years after the death of Coryat. The &quot;List of Tombs and Monuments in the Bombay Presidency&quot; had described it as &#x27;consisting of a dome resting on circular pillars&#x27; in Muslim architectural style, which is similar to a monument present at Rajgari near Suvali. This monument is now State Protected Monument identifying it as the tomb of Tom Coryat (S-GJ-231). There is no inscription or other clue supporting it as the tomb; however, it is known that the tomb had just two marked stones originally and there is no known reason why a monument was erected later. Thomas Herbert, who visited India ten years after the death of Coryat, noted that a Persian ambassador, who died on board the fleet at Swally, was buried near him in Surat. Dr. John Fryer who was at Surat in 1675 was shown the tombs of the Persian ambassador and Coryat, along with several Armenian Christian tombs outside the Bharuch gate. The original location of the gate is not known, as the old mud wall fort was replaced by a brick wall fort after the Battle of Surat. During the British period, William Morrison, the collector of Surat, tried to find the tomb and later concluded that it is lost in the periodical floods of the Tapi river.

== Legacy ==
British travel writer and historian William Dalrymple cites Coryat as &#x27;one of my travel-writing heroes&#x27; in his first book &quot;In Xanadu&quot; (1989).

British travel writer and humorist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat&#x27;s tour of Europe, as recounted in his book &quot;Continental Drifter&quot; (2000). In 2008 Daniel Allen published an account of his nine-month cycle trip following Coryat&#x27;s journey to the East, entitled &quot;The Sky Above, The Kingdom Below&quot;.

Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler spoke at the Australian Festival of Travel Writing about Thomas Coryat. Wheeler traced Coryate&#x27;s (his spelling) journey as he observed the invention of leisure travel. He visited his supposed tomb at Rajgari near Surat in 2010.

<text>Where Eagles Dare is a 1968 action adventure war film directed by Brian G. Hutton and starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood and Mary Ure. Set during World War II, it follows a Special Operations Executive team charged with saving a captured American General from the fictional &quot;Schloß Adler&quot; fortress, except the mission turns out not to be as it seems. It was filmed in Panavision using the Metrocolor process, and was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Alistair MacLean wrote the screenplay, his first, at the same time that he wrote the novel of the same name. Both became commercial successes.

The film involved some of the top filmmakers of the day and was shot on location in Austria. Hollywood stuntman Yakima Canutt was the second unit director and shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman Alf Joint doubled for Burton in many sequences, including the fight on top of the cable car; award-winning conductor and composer Ron Goodwin wrote the film score; and future Oscar nominee Arthur Ibbetson worked on the cinematography.

&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; received mostly positive critical reaction, with praise for its action sequences, score and the performances of Burton and Eastwood, and has since been considered a classic.

==Plot==

During World War II, MI6 officers Colonel Turner and Admiral Rolland assemble a commando team for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines: Major John Smith, Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson, Captains Lee Thomas, Ted Berkeley, and Olaf Christiansen, and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer. Their task is to rescue American Brigadier General George Carnaby—a chief planner for the Western Front—captured by the Germans and held at &quot;Schloß Adler&quot;, an alpine mountaintop fortress in Bavaria, accessible only by cable car.

Disguised as German soldiers, the team parachutes near the castle. Harrod is found dead with a broken neck, and Smith deduces he was murdered. Smith secretly meets with his lover, British agent Mary Ellison, but keeps her involvement a secret from his men. Smith and his team infiltrate the village at the base of &quot;Schloß Adler&quot; where he meets undercover agent Heidi Schmidt, who has arranged for Mary to work inside the castle. Smith discloses to Mary that Carnaby is actually an imposter, U.S. Corporal Cartwright Jones, and his capture was staged by the British. Later, Smith discovers MacPherson dead.

When German forces arrive, ostensibly searching for deserters, Smith deduces his team has been betrayed and surrenders to avoid an unwinnable fight. Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen are taken to the castle, while Smith and Schaffer kill their captors en route and escape. They blow up a supply depot and use the ensuing chaos to infiltrate the castle via cable car. Inside, they meet Mary and secretly observe General Rosemeyer and Colonel Kramer interrogate Carnaby. Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen eventually arrive, revealed to be German double agents. 

Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn on the men. However, Smith then forces Schaffer to surrender his weapon and identifies himself as Major Johann Schmidt of the SS&#x27;s intelligence branch. He exposes Carnaby&#x27;s identity and claims that Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen are MI6 agents impersonating German spies. Smith conveys proof of his identity by showing the name of Germany&#x27;s top spy in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it, and challenges the double agents to prove themselves by listing the names of their fellow agents in Britain.

Afterwards, Smith reveals the truth: believing German spies have extensively infiltrated British intelligence, MI6 identified Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen as suspects, and launched the mission to prove this and obtain the identities of their accomplices and commander. Schaffer then fatally shoots Kramer and Rosemeyer. The team and Carnaby make their escape, taking Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen as prisoners. 

As alarms sound, Schaffer sets explosives around the castle while Smith radios Rolland for extraction. The group travel to the cable car station, sacrificing Thomas as a decoy. Berkeley and Christiansen break free and attempt their own escape in a cable car; both are thwarted and killed by Smith. Reunited with Heidi on the ground, the team uses a bus to battle their way onto an airfield and escape aboard a Ju 52 transport, with Turner waiting onboard.

In the air, Smith reveals that Kramer identified Turner as Germany&#x27;s top spy in Britain, confirming Rolland&#x27;s suspicions. Turner chose Smith to lead the mission, believing he was a German double agent—unaware he was actually working undercover for Rolland. To ensure the mission&#x27;s success, Smith then secretly recruited Mary—his trusted ally—and Schaffer, who had no ties to the compromised MI6. To avoid a humiliating court martial and execution, Turner is permitted to jump from the aircraft to his death. As the exhausted operatives fly home, Schaffer wryly suggests that Smith keep his next mission &quot;all-British&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
Burton later said, &quot;I decided to do the picture because Elizabeth [Taylor]&#x27;s two sons said they were fed up with me making films they weren&#x27;t allowed to see, or in which I get killed. They wanted me to kill a few people instead.&quot;

Burton approached producer Elliott Kastner &quot;and asked him if he had some super-hero stuff for me where I don&#x27;t get killed in the end.&quot;

The producer consulted MacLean and requested an adventure film filled with mystery, suspense, and action. Most of MacLean&#x27;s novels had been made into films or were being filmed. Kastner persuaded MacLean to write a new story; six weeks later, he delivered the script, at that time entitled &quot;Castle of Eagles&quot;. Kastner hated the title, and chose &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; instead. The title is from Act I, Scene III, Line 71 in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;: &quot;The world is grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch&quot;. Like virtually all of MacLean&#x27;s works, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; features his trademark &quot;secret traitor&quot;, who must be unmasked by the end.
Kastner and co-producer Jerry Gershwin announced in July 1966 that they had purchased five MacLean scripts, starting with &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; and &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot;. Brian Hutton had just made &quot;Sol Madrid&quot; for the producers and was signed to direct.

===Filming===
Eastwood and Burton reportedly dubbed the film &#x27;Where Doubles Dare&#x27; due to the amount of screen time in which stand-ins doubled for the cast during action sequences. Filming began on 2 January 1968 in Austria and concluded in July 1968. Eastwood received a salary of $800,000 while Burton received $1,200,000. This is one of the first sound films to have used front projection effect. This technology enabled filming of the scenes where the actors are on top of the cable car.

Eastwood initially thought the script written by MacLean was &quot;terrible&quot; and was &quot;all exposition and complications.&quot; According to Derren Nesbitt, Eastwood requested that he be given less dialogue. Most of Schaffer&#x27;s lines were given to Burton, whilst Eastwood handled most of the action scenes. Director Hutton played to his actors&#x27; strengths, allowing for Burton&#x27;s theatrical background to help the character of Smith and Eastwood&#x27;s quiet demeanour to establish Schaffer. Eastwood took the part on the advice of his agent, who felt it would be interesting to see his client appear with someone with seniority. Eastwood and Burton got along well on set. Ingrid Pitt had spent part of her childhood in a concentration camp and reportedly found it uncomfortable to work on the movie.

Derren Nesbitt was keen to be as authentic as possible with the character of the suspicious Major von Hapen. Whilst on location, he requested to meet a former member of the Gestapo to better understand how to play the character and to get the military regalia correct. While dressed in his SS uniform, he caused a Baron to faint with shock and found out that he was Himmler&#x27;s driver. Nesbitt said that the &quot;Jewish chronicle called me afterwards and said, &#x27;How could you play a German?&#x27; I said &#x27;I do it because I play them very badly.&#x27; That seemed to satisfy them.&quot; He was injured on set whilst filming the scene in which Schaffer kills von Hapen. The blood squib attached to Nesbitt exploded with such force that he was temporarily blinded, though he made a quick recovery.
The filming was delayed due to the adverse weather in Austria. Shooting took place in winter and early spring of 1968, and the crew had to contend with blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and potential avalanches. Further delays were incurred when Richard Burton, well known for his drinking binges, disappeared for several days, with his friends Peter O&#x27;Toole, Oliver Reed, Trevor Howard and Richard Harris. As part of his deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Clint Eastwood took delivery of a Norton P11 motorcycle, which he &#x27;tested&#x27; at Brands Hatch racetrack, accompanied by Ingrid Pitt, something that he had been forbidden from doing by Kastner for insurance purposes in case of injury or worse.

Stuntman Alf Joint, who had played Capungo – the man whom 007 electrocuted in the bathtub in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; – doubled and was stand-in for Richard Burton, and performed the famous cable car jump sequence, during which he lost three teeth. Joint stated that at one point during production, Burton was so drunk that he knocked himself out while filming and Joint had to quickly fill in for him. Derren Nesbitt observed that Burton was drinking as many as four bottles of vodka per day.

Visitors to the set included Burton&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Taylor,
and Robert Shaw, who was then married to Mary Ure.

At one point during filming, Burton was threatened at gunpoint by an overzealous fan.

The Junkers Ju 52 used to fly Smith and Schaffer&#x27;s team into Austria and then make their escape at the end of the film was a Swiss Air Force Ju 52/3m, registration A-702. It was destroyed in an accident on 4 August 2018, killing all 20 people on board.
* The castle setting was Hohenwerfen Castle, Werfen, Austria; filmed in January 1968.
* Filming of the cable car and lower cable car station took place in January 1968 at the Feuerkogel Seilbahn at Ebensee, Austria, and the close-ups were done on a soundstage. Scenes featuring the castle and the cable car together were filmed using a scale model.
* Airport scenes were filmed at the Flugplatz at Aigen im Ennstal, Austria; filmed in early 1968. The exact place of filming is the &quot;Fiala-Fernbrugg&quot; garrison, still used by &quot;HS Geschwader 2&quot; and &quot;FlAR2/3rd Bat.&quot; of the Austrian Army. The big rocky mountain in the background of the airfield is the Grimming mountains, about 40 km east of the &quot;Hoher Dachstein&quot;, or about 80 km east and 10 km south from Werfen.
* The village setting was Lofer, Austria; filmed in January 1968.
* Other scenes were shot at MGM-British Studios, Borehamwood, England; filmed in spring 1968.

==Release==
&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; received a Royal premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square cinema on 22 January 1969 with Princess Alexandra in attendance. Of the stars of the film, only Clint Eastwood was not present as he was filming &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; in Mexico.

==Reception==

&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; was a huge success, earning $6,560,000 at the North American box office during its first year of release. It was the seventh-most popular film at the UK box office in 1969, and 13th in the US.
Though many critics found the plot somewhat confusing, reviews of the film were generally positive.
Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave a positive review, praising the action scenes and cinematography. Likewise, &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, describing it as &#x27;Highly entertaining, thrilling and rarely lets down for a moment… more of a saga of cool, calculated courage, than any glorification of war.&#x27;. The film was particularly lucrative for Richard Burton, who earned a considerable sum in royalties through television repeats and video sales. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; had its first showing on British television on 26 December 1979 on BBC1.

&quot;Mad Magazine&quot; published a satire of the film in its October 1969 issue under the title &quot;Where Vultures Fare.&quot; In 2009 &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; released a special issue dedicated to &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; which detailed the production and filming of the film.

Years after its debut, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; enjoys a reputation as a classic and is considered by many as one of the best war films of all time. General praise is given towards Burton and Eastwood&#x27;s performances, as well as the various actions scenes. Director Steven Spielberg cited it as his favourite war film. &quot;Empire&quot; film critic Ian Nathan gave the film three out of five stars, citing it as &quot;A fine example of that war movie staple&quot; and calling it, a &quot;Classic War caper with a few too many plot contrivances but high on adventure&quot;. From the review in The Movie Scene: &quot;&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; is by no means a great movie but it achieves what it sets out to do and that is to deliver action, adventure and excitement in a Boy&#x27;s Own kind of way.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; was released on Blu-ray in 2010.

==Soundtrack==
The score was composed by Ron Goodwin. A soundtrack was released on Compact Disc in 2005 by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot;, of the Silver Age Classics series, in association with Turner Entertainment. It was a two-disc release, the first CD being the film music, the second the film music for &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; and source music for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;. The release has been limited to 3,000 pressings. The soundtrack has received critical acclaim.

==Novel==

The principal difference is that the 1966 novel by Alistair MacLean is less violent. One scene during the escape from the castle where Smith saves a German guard from burning to death presaged the non-lethal thriller vein that MacLean would explore in his later career. In the novel the characters are more clearly defined and slightly more humorous than their depictions in the film, which is fast-paced and has sombre performances from Burton and Eastwood at its centre. Three characters are differently named in the novel: Ted Berkeley is called Edward Carraciola, Jock MacPherson is called Torrance-Smythe, and Major von Hapen is instead Captain von Brauchitsch. The love stories between Schaffer and Heidi and between Smith and Mary were also cut. Indeed, in the novel Smith asks London to arrange for a priest to meet them at the airport.

In the book the group is flown into Germany on board an RAF Avro Lancaster, whereas in the film they are transported in a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Junkers Ju 52. While in the film Kramer, Rosemeyer, and von Hapen are shot dead by Schaffer, in the novel they are just given high doses of nembutal. In the book Thomas, Carraciola, and Christiansen attempt to escape in the cable car with Smith on the roof. Carraciola is crushed by the steel suspension arm of the cable car while struggling with Smith on the roof; Thomas and Christiansen fall to their deaths after Smith blows the cable car up with plastic explosive. In the film Christiansen is killed and Berkeley (Carraciola in the novel) incapacitated by Smith on the cable car (he dies when the cable car explodes), and Thomas is shot and killed by a German while climbing down a rope.

<text>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (), abbreviated as BOCHK (), is a subsidiary of the Bank of China (via the Hong Kong-listed intermediate holding company BOC Hong Kong Holdings). Bank of China (Hong Kong) is the second-largest commercial banking group in Hong Kong in terms of assets and customer deposits (2008 data), with more than 190 branches across Hong Kong as of the end of 2019. It is also one of the three commercial banks licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue banknotes for the Hong Kong dollar.

BOCHK is legally separated from its parent, Bank of China (BOC), although they maintain close relations in management and administration and co-operate in several areas, including reselling BOC&#x27;s insurance and securities services. BOCHK is also the biggest member and the JETCO ATM and payment system, and the designated clearing bank in Hong Kong for transactions involving the Renminbi (RMB / CNY).

BOCHK was established on 1 October 2001 from a merger of 12 subsidiaries and associates of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in October 2002. As of the end of 2019, the bank had HKD3,026 billion in assets and an operating profit of HKD39.8 billion. Its head office is in the Bank of China Tower in Central, Hong Kong. The head office is shared with the Hong Kong units of its parent company; it was completed in 1988 and was the first building outside North America to exceed in height.

==History==

===Bank of China Group===
The opening of a branch of the Bank of China in Hong Kong in 1917 marked the entry of state-owned Chinese banks into the then-colony&#x27;s banking sector. Other banks soon followed suit, starting with Yien Yieh Commercial Bank in 1918. By the time the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, there were 15 branches of state-owned Chinese banks in Hong Kong, plus branches of nine mainland-incorporated banks that were public-private joint ventures. In addition, the Chinese government established Po Sang Bank in 1949 and Nanyang Commercial Bank in 1950. Both of these were incorporated in Hong Kong.

In 1952, the nine public-private banks (namely, Sin Hua Bank Limited, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, China State Bank Limited, The National Commercial Bank Limited, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Young Brothers Banking Corporation, Wo Sang Bank and National Industrial Bank of China) were grouped into the Joint Office of Joint Public-Private Banks. The Hong Kong branches of the last three of these nine were closed in 1954 when their parents were shut down by the central government, and management of the remaining six public-private banks were transferred to the Hong Kong and Macau Regional Office of the Bank of China in 1958. The Bank of China later took over management of the Hong Kong branches of Kwangtung Provincial Bank, Hua Chiao Commercial Bank and the Bank of Communications (HKSE: 3328).

In June 1975, the Bank of China moved to increase the capital of the public-private banks. As all of the new capital was from the Chinese government, private ownership in the public-private banks was substantially reduced, in some cases to less than 1%.

The 14 banks were rebranded as part of the Bank of China Group in the 1980s, after a common IT platform was established. Treasury and foreign currency exchange operations were also centralised. However, the individual banks retained their own management. They are now the second-largest banking group in Hong Kong.

===Restructuring and listing===
The Hong Kong branch of the Bank of Communications broke off from the Bank of China Group in 1998. The Bank of China Group started to restructure its operations in 1999 in preparation for an initial public offering. All minority shareholders (except for those of Chiyu) were bought out by the Bank of China. Formal plans for a restructuring received the approval of the People&#x27;s Bank of China and were launched in January 2001.

The restructuring saw all operations of the mainland-incorporated group members merged into Po Sang Bank, which was then immediately renamed Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. Hong Kong incorporated Nanyang Commercial Bank and Chiyu Banking Corporation became subsidiaries of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. Legislation was required for the merger, as Hong Kong does not allow mergers via the pooling of interests, a common procedure in the United States. The &quot;Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (Merger) Ordinance&quot; was approved by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on 12 July 2001, and the merger was completed on 1 October 2001.

==Corporate structure and BOC Hong Kong Holdings==
Bank of China (Hong Kong) is a listed company of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, via its parent company BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Limited (BOCHK Holdings). The holding owned 100% shares of the bank.

Moreover, American depositary receipt of the shares of the holdings, were traded on OTC Market.

BOCHK Holdings is a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. The listing of BOCHK Holdings in July 2002 listing was the first international stock listing by a mainland China bank; until that time, other mainland Chinese bank listings were done in the domestic &quot;A-share&quot; market.

For the 12 months ended 31 December 2019, BOCHK Holdings earned HKD58.4 billion in operating income and HKD34.1 billion in net profit. As of the end of 2019, 65.65% of BOCHK Holdings is held by Bank of China Group, in turn 69.265% owned by Central Huijin Investment, an investment holding company 100% owned by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Operations==

BOCHK offers a comprehensive range of financial products and services to retail and corporate customers, similar to those offered by most commercial banks. It is primarily known for its interest-income business (taking deposits from retail customers for loans to corporates) although it has been moving into other non-interest-income areas such as personal loans, wealth management and other financial services in recent years. It has Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest branch network including approximately 190 branches, 280
automated banking centres, over 1,000 automatic teller machines as of end 2019.

BOCHK is one of the key mortgage lenders in Hong Kong. The other key lenders include HSBC and Hang Seng Bank.

Within mainland China, BOCHK operates 14 branches () separately from its parent. BOCHK is treated as a foreign bank, more properly, 境外銀行 (&quot;banks outside of the territory&quot;), for regulatory purposes as it is incorporated in Hong Kong. However, partly to clear up confusion between it and its parent in the mainland, it shifted all of its mainland-based business to Nanyang Commercial Bank in 2007.

===Renminbi clearing bank===

BOCHK has been the designated clearing bank for personal transactions involving the Renminbi (CNY, the currency of mainland China) in Hong Kong since February 2004. This means that BOCHK acts as a settlement agent for RMB banknotes and funds in Hong Kong and an intermediary between banks in Hong Kong and the People&#x27;s Bank of China, the central bank of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In return, BOCHK takes a 0.125% cut of all RMB deposits in Hong Kong that are repatriated back to mainland China.

The chief executive of Hong Kong announced on 18 November 2003 that the People&#x27;s Bank of China had agreed to provide clearing arrangements, marking for the first time that the Renminbi, which is fully on the current account but not on the capital account, has been allowed to clear outside of mainland China. The scope of such RMB business includes deposit-taking, exchange, remittances and RMB cards. Hong Kong banks were invited to apply to become the designated clearing bank for RMB business; the People&#x27;s Bank of China subsequently chose BOCHK as the clearing bank, for a term of three years.

According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the major responsibilities of the clearing bank are to:
* open RMB settlement accounts for participating banks for the acceptance and withdrawal of RMB funds
* open a settlement account with the PBOC&#x27;s Shenzhen sub-branch to centralise the acceptance and withdrawal of RMB funds of the Clearing Bank and the participating banks
* collect and distribute RMB banknotes
* provide clearing services for RMB remittances and RMB cards issued by Hong Kong banks
* provide services for the participating banks to square their RMB open positions that result from the exchange of RMB into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa.

===Nanyang Commercial Bank===

Founded in 1950 in Hong Kong, Nanyang Commercial Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of BOCHK, with 42 branches. Nanyang primarily focuses on corporate customers, in particular small and medium-sized trading and manufacturing companies. It also has a loyal following among the overseas Chinese community, especially in Southeast Asia. It relies on BOCHK for back-end office and IT support. In 2007, it took over all of BOCHK&#x27;s mainland operations, corporate and individual.

===Chiyu Banking Corporation===
Founded by Tan Kah Kee, an overseas Chinese in 1947, Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited has 23 branches in Hong Kong and focuses on serving the community of residents of Fujian descent in Hong Kong.

Chiyu was explicitly created by Chen to create a sustainable business with profits to be devoted to education in Xiamen and the rest of Fujian province in China. Since its founding, it has spent more than HK$1 billion in education in the province, primarily through funding Jimei University and its related schools.

In 2017 BOC (HK) sold Chiyu Bank.

===JETCO===


JETCO () (Joint Electronic Teller Services Limited) is the biggest network of automatic teller machines in Hong Kong and Macau, with nearly 3,000 cash machines. JETCO was founded along with the Bank of East Asia, Chekiang First Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank and Wing Lung Bank, and at present covers HSBC and Hang Seng Bank, which have their own system. JETCO&#x27;s agreement with UnionPay has been terminated leaving two choices for Hong Kong-based customers: get a UnionPay card, usable like any other on the mainland, or look for a Bank of East Asia ATM (Bank of East Asia has linked all of its mainland-based ATMs into the JETCO network) that can be used like any other JETCO ATM.

===Other operations===
BOCHK also owns a travel agency known as BOC Travel Services. This is a legacy from its acquisition of Nanyang Commercial Bank, which ran a travel agency for the convenience of its Southeast Asian customers.

===Brunei===
In 2016, BOCHK opened a branch in Brunei, becoming the first Chinese bank to establish itself in the country.

===Malaysia, Thailand===
==Banknotes==

Although not a central bank, BOCHK issues banknotes in Hong Kong. Under present arrangements, most Hong Kong dollar notes are not issued by a central bank or monetary authority, but by three specially licensed commercial banks, these being the Bank of China, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank.

Bank of China started to issue Hong Kong dollar notes on 1 May 1994, under the name of &quot;Bank of China Hong Kong Branch&quot;. Following the bank&#x27;s 2001 merger and restructuring, a new set of notes bearing the name &quot;Bank of China (Hong Kong)&quot; went into circulation in 2004. Under the &quot;Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (Merger) Ordinance&quot;, banknotes issued by the Bank of China prior to its merger remained legal tender and became the obligations of Bank of China (Hong Kong).

As one of the three note-issuing banks, BOCHK is also a rotating chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the main industry body of commercial banks in Hong Kong.

==Bank of China Tower==
The Bank of China Tower in Central houses the headquarters of Bank of China Hong Kong. Designed by Ieoh Ming Pei, the 70-storey building&#x27;s height is 315 metres with two masts reaching 369 metres. Construction began in 1985 and the building was completed in 1989, with its official opening on 17 May 1990.

Bank of China Tower was the first building outside North America to break the mark, the first composite space frame high-rise building and was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992. A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public; visits to the main observation deck on the 70th floor is by appointment only.

The structural expressionism adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction.

==Corporate governance==

One of the stated goals of the restructuring of BOCHK was to aggressively improve corporate governance and risk management. Issues regarding BOCHK&#x27;s corporate governance were widely reported in 2003 and 2004 following allegations of misconduct. Investigations are continuing . BOCHK subsequently reorganised and tightened internal controls, and made several executive appointments via a global replacement effort.

===Liu Jinbao===
A former CEO of BOCHK, Liu Jinbao, was abruptly transferred back to Beijing to become vice-chairman of Bank of China in May 2003. Investigations subsequently found Liu to have &quot;committed economic crimes&quot; in connection with his previous appointment as the head of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China. Liu was subsequently dismissed from his post. Liu, along with three other senior managers, were also alleged to have made &quot;unauthorised distribution for personal purposes&quot; of funds belonging to the Bank of China before BOCHK was established. &quot;The Standard&quot; speculated that the amount involved was HK$30 million.

===New Nongkai loan===
A special committee appointed by BOC (Hong Kong) Holdings in consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority found that the granting of a HK$1.77 billion bridge loan to Chau Ching-ngai (sometimes referred to as &quot;Zhou Zhengyi&quot; depending on transliteration), involved &quot;risks identified at the start (that) were not addressed adequately&quot; and was granted despite &quot;serious reservations expressed by the Risk Management Department (BOCHK)&quot;. Liu Jinbao was criticised by the committee and a deputy CEO, Or Man-ah, took early retirement as a result.

<doc id="1145765" wikidata="Q474672" url="?curid=1145765" title="Bertha Palmer">
<text>Bertha Matilde Palmer (; May 22, 1849 – May 5, 1918) was an American businesswoman, socialite, and philanthropist. She was the wife of millionaire Potter Palmer and early member of the Chicago Woman&#x27;s Club, as well as president of the Board of Lady Managers. She is most known for her work during the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, as well as her donation of her impressionist art collection to the Art Institute of Chicago.

==Early life==
Born as Bertha Matilde Honoré in Louisville, Kentucky, her father was businessman Henry Hamilton Honoré. Her family moved to Chicago in 1855, when Bertha was six years old. Known within the family as &quot;Cissie&quot;, she studied in her home town and achieved a reputation as a musician, linguist, writer, politician, and administrator. She was one of six children, and the oldest of the Honoré daughters. Her sister, Ida Marie Honoré, was married to Frederick Dent Grant, eldest son of general and president Ulysses S. Grant. She was a graduate of Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, and also attended St. Xavier Academy. She graduated in 1867 with high academic achievements which included multiple fields of science, literature, and algebra.
==Personal life and marriage==

She married the Chicago millionaire Potter Palmer in 1870. She was 21 and he was 44. Palmer was a Quaker merchant who had come to Chicago after failing twice in business. The two met in 1862 when Bertha was just 13 years old.

In Chicago, he learned to please his customers, many of whom were women. He made customer service a priority and carried everything from dry goods to the latest French fashions for ladies. Palmer sold his vast store to a consortium, and it would eventually become Marshall Field&#x27;s. Palmer then opened a luxury hotel, Palmer House, and invested in real estate, eventually owning a vast portfolio of properties.

Soon after their marriage, the Chicago Fire wiped out the Palmer House and most of their holdings. Bertha Palmer had to rush off to wire the east so that Palmer could re-establish credit, borrow money and rebuild his holdings. 95% of Palmers buildings and assets were destroyed in the fire. Shortly after the fire, Bertha Palmer changed Potter Palmer&#x27;s mind about leaving Chicago. &quot;Mr. Palmer, it&#x27;s the duty of every Chicagoan to stay here and help to rebuild this stricken city&quot;. Bertha Palmer was unusually poised for one so young, and together, the Palmers re-established their fortune. Despite her age, she quickly rose to the top of Chicago society. &quot;She was beautiful, dashing, quick, and smart; and more than that, she was sure of herself,&quot; wrote historian Ernest Poole.

In 1874, she gave birth to son Honoré, and in 1875, she gave birth to son Potter Palmer II. Both sons went on to have children including Potter Palmer II naming his son Potter Palmer III.

Palmer was an early member of the Chicago Woman&#x27;s Club, and part of the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs; this group of working women met to discuss social problems and develop solutions. They supported kindergartens until the city made them part of the school system, campaigned for inexpensive milk for impoverished children, and better care for children of imprisoned mothers. She was also an early member of the Fortnightly Club of Chicago, alongside Jane Addams and Ellen Martin Henrotin, and was a patron of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League that worked to start unions and safe working conditions for factory girls. She and Mr. Palmer were also members of the esteemed Chicago Club. Even though the Palmer House did sell alcohol, Palmer was quite interested in the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. 

Palmer approved of Jane Addams&#x27; work at Hull House and gave aid when needed to the civil service. Her main goal was women&#x27;s education and funding programs that would help. &quot;&#x27;If funds were lacking for any good cause, or if we had to make up a quota, we just asked the Potter Palmers,&#x27; commented Mrs. Carter H. Harrison, the Mayor&#x27;s wife&quot;. While she never was a suffragette, she did understand the importance of rights for women, believing that men and women should work together to solve their problems. She was a socialite women who followed the problems and difficulties of the classes lower than her own. 

While she believed in women&#x27;s rights, and helping the working class, she was more conservative with her politics and thinking. As the President of the Board of Lady Managers she was very firm and often clashed with women under her who did not agree with her more conservative beliefs including her refusal of African American women to join the Board of Lady Managers to include and satisfy factions of women from the south.

==Chicago World&#x27;s Fair and The Women&#x27;s Building==
Chicago was the site of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893, a celebration of the discovery of the New World by Columbus. It also marked the city&#x27;s recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Women had a large presence in the fair and the plum position was the President of the Board of Lady Managers, which Bertha Palmer was selected to lead in 1891. While the positions were honorary, the women had a great deal of work to do. The board chose Sophia Hayden as architect for The Woman&#x27;s Building and designer to supervise the interior decoration. However, when Hayden wouldn&#x27;t take Palmer&#x27;s advice to accept rich women&#x27;s donations of architectural odds and ends to decorate the exterior, fearing a horrible visual impact as a result, Palmer fired Hayden and hired the much more malleable Candace Wheeler to supervise the interior decoration. The Chicago art curator Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846–1924) worked closely with Palmer on the art exhibits and the murals. Apparently, it was Palmer who chose the theme of &quot;Primitive Woman&quot; and &quot;Modern Woman&quot; for the two murals and Hallowell and Palmer&#x27;s first choice for both murals was Elizabeth Jane Gardner (1837–1922), an experienced academic painter and the paramour of William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825–1905). However, the time to paint the two huge murals (12&#x27; x 54&#x27;) was short and the artist did not feel that she had the energy to complete the project. Hallowell then recommended the young academic painter Mary Fairchild MacMonnies and the Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt to do the two murals and after their initial rejection of the contracts, the women only had a number of months to complete the murals and have them shipped to Chicago. Led by Palmer, who approached Congress on the matter, the board also requested that the mint produce a new commemorative coin for the Exposition and their efforts resulted in the Isabella quarter. Following the opening of the Exposition, Palmer sat for the fashionable Swedish painter Anders Zorn (1860–1920), who was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers from the fair. Relative to Ms. Palmer&#x27;s Inclusivity: (CNN: 2021) &quot;That year (World Fair), for the very first time, a group of White women managed to obtain the space and funds for a &quot;Women&#x27;s Building&quot; to showcase American women&#x27;s achievements from the past century. During the closing ceremony of The Woman&#x27;s Building, Bertha Palmer delivered the final address stating, &quot;Not only have the material exhibits drawn attention to the skill of women and shown the point of development which has been reached by them, but their interests, their capabilities, their needs, and their hopes have been brought before the public and thoroughly discussed from every point of view during the time of preparation for, as well as during the continuance of, the Exposition&quot;.

According to at least one legend, Palmer helped invent the chocolate brownie when she directed that her kitchen staff come up with a confection smaller than a piece of cake for women attending the Columbian Exposition.

One of Palmer&#x27;s challenges as President of the Board of Lady Managers was greeting the highly official guests that arrived at the fair; the most difficult, Infanta Eulalia of Spain. Since the beginning of her stay, the Infanta was quite difficult especially when it came to talking to Bertha Palmer, who she had called &quot;&#x27;An innkeeper&#x27;s wife!&#x27;&quot; referring to Bertha&#x27;s relation to The Palmer House. Since the Infanta was royalty, she did not like Bertha Palmer&#x27;s lavish lifestyle as it appeared to the Infanta that Palmer was competing with the duchess as to who had the best grace and authority. The conflict between the two women made it to the newspapers. &quot;The story took on exaggerated twists. It was gleefully related that the two women had occupied separate thrones in the ballroom, but that there had not been enough room under one roof for two such regal personages. It was more than rumor that guests had been asked to bow and curtsy twice- once to the Infanta and once to their hostess&quot;. 

==Art collecting==
At the time of the fair, the Palmers had been enthusiastic art collectors for a number of years. They depended on the curator Sarah Hallowell, a Philadelphia Quaker who they had met in 1873, for advice and she introduced the Palmers to the painters in Paris and to the latest artistic trends in the French capital. Most Midwestern collectors were still collecting works by the Barbizon School in the 1870s and 1880s, but thanks to the Palmers, this would soon change. In the years leading up to the Columbian Exposition, they became clients of the Parisian dealer Paul Durand-Ruel and began to collect French Impressionist works. Because Hallowell was curating a loan exhibition of the latest French art for the exposition, the Palmers accelerated their collecting because the curator wanted the latest and greatest in French art for the fair. Palmer&#x27;s collection of Impressionist paintings was unrivaled, soon they had twenty-nine Monets and eleven Renoirs, nine of the Monets were from the &quot;Haystacks&quot; series, painted 1890–91. These works now form the core of the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s Impressionist collection. Hallowell also tried to get the Palmers interested in Auguste Rodin&#x27;s work, which he had loaned her for the fair. The frankness of his nudes had caused a stir at the fair and after resisting for a number of months, works by Rodin entered the collection as well and these were among the first acquired by American collectors. Bertha Palmer enjoyed her role as a cultural leader and tastemaker. In 1905, Hallowell finally convinced Mrs. Palmer to sit for Rodin.

==Luxurious mansions and lavish spending==
Bertha Palmer was famous for her free-spending ways. Her husband indulged her and did not mind that she was in the limelight. Her jewelry was legendary. According to the author Aline B. Saarinen,

so fabulous were her jewels that a newspaper declared that when she appeared on the S.S. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse with a tiara of diamonds as large as lima beans, a corsage panned with diamonds, a sunburst as big as a baseball, a stomacher of diamonds and all the pearls around her neck, Alois Burgskeller of the Metropolitan Opera, who was singing at the ship&#x27;s concert, was stopped right in the middle of a high note.

She traveled throughout Europe, dining with kings and queens and mixing with industrialists and statesmen.

Vast sums were spent on the Palmer Mansion in Chicago, starting with $100,000 and rising over $1 million. Potter Palmer dictated in his will that a sum of money should go to whoever next married Bertha. When asked why he would be so generous to his own replacement, he replied, &quot;Because he&#x27;ll need it.&quot;

According to her son Potter II, Palmer was always known for her looks and the luxury that accompanied her. &quot;&#x27;Before my mother became enamored with Florida, she had long been acknowledged as the fashionable queen of Chicago. Noted for her beauty, her wit, her fabulous pearls and diamonds, and the enormous Gothic Palmer Castle. Of her jewels, father would say, &#x27;There she stands with $200,000 just around her neck.&#x27;&quot; 

She also maintained homes in London and Paris and, following her husband&#x27;s death in 1902, rumors abounded that she would marry a titled man. Among the suspected suitors were the earl of Munster, the duke of Atholl, the prince of Monaco, and the king of Serbia. However, these rumors all proved to be unfounded when she remained unmarried.

In September 1907, Bertha Palmer and her son Potter II took part in the maiden voyage of the new Cunard liner &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot; from Liverpool to New York.

==Florida real estate pioneer==
Bertha Palmer became interested in the winter climate of Florida and in 1910 bought over 80,000 acres of land in and around Sarasota, Florida—about one-third of the land in what was then the massive county named Manatee. In 1914, she bought of land as an exclusive hunting preserve called &quot;River Hills&quot; in Temple Terrace, Florida. After her death, her sons inherited the land and eventually sold it to developers who created the Mediterranean Revival golf course community of Temple Terrace, Florida.

She became a progressive rancher, land developer, and farm developer who introduced many innovations to encourage the Florida ranching, citrus, dairy, and farming industries. Palmer was one of the first famous people to winter in Florida, beginning a now-common practice. She encouraged wealthy friends and associates in her international social circles to spend winters along Sarasota Bay and her other Florida land interests and promoted the development of many land parcels; today much of that land is still known as Palmer Ranch. The major roads through her property, as well as some connecting to the existing communities, were named by her. Those names remain unchanged as Honoré, Lockwood Ridge, Tuttle, Webber, and Macintosh.

She proved herself to be an astute businesswoman: within sixteen years after her husband&#x27;s death, she managed to double the value of the estate he had left her. After her death, a large parcel of her land was donated (donated according to Sarasota County, sold according to the state) by her sons to become Myakka River State Park.

Her grandson Potter D&#x27;Orsay Palmer (1908–39) became a notorious playboy who married four times and died after a brawl in Sarasota. His and Bertha&#x27;s legacy are recounted in Frank A Cassell&#x27;s book &quot;Suncoast Empire&quot;.

==Death==
Palmer died of breast cancer on May 5th 1918, at her winter residence, The Oaks, in Osprey, Florida. Her body was returned to Chicago to lie in state at the Castle, the sumptuous mansion Potter Palmer had built on Chicago&#x27;s Gold Coast. Bertha Palmer is buried alongside her husband in Graceland Cemetery.
== Legacy ==
Bertha Palmer&#x27;s legacy can still be seen around Chicago today. The Palmer House still stands on Monroe street, selling Bertha Palmer&#x27;s brownie recipe, as well as a park named after her; Honoré Palmer (Bertha) Park, located on Honoré St. in East Village. Her art collection is still on display in the impressionist wing at the Art Institute Chicago. The documentary &quot;Love Under Fire: The Story of Bertha and Potter Palmer&quot; premiered on PBS in 2013.

<text>Ordinary Average Guy is the ninth solo studio album, and its title track (second on the playlist), by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. The album was released in mid 1991. It was Walsh&#x27;s first album of entirely new music since &quot;Got Any Gum?&quot; in 1987, and his first solo album to be issued internationally by Epic following a four-year alliance with Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Canada. The album features Ringo Starr, Survivor&#x27;s lead vocalist Jimi Jamison, and the drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh&#x27;s former band Barnstorm. Vitale also sings the lead vocals on the final track of the album, &quot;School Days&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Writing for AllMusic, critic Vincent Jeffries wrote of the album &quot;This collection of nostalgia, decent balladry, and quirky anthems probably reinforced any notions of Joe Walsh&#x27;s creative decline... this reflective, sometimes half-hearted effort belies a weariness that&#x27;s both sad and difficult to appreciate as this master goes through the motions.&quot;

<text>The (literally &quot;metal stick&quot; or &quot;metal club&quot;) is a spiked or studded two-handed war club used in feudal Japan by samurai. Other related weapons of this type are the nyoibō, konsaibō, , and ararebō. Related solid iron weapons with no spikes or studs are the (or kanamuchi) and the (also known as a gojo or kirikobo).

== Description ==
&quot;Kanabō&quot; and other related club-like weapons were constructed out of heavy wood or made entirely from iron, with iron spikes or studs on one end. For wooden &quot;kanabō&quot;, one or both ends could be covered with iron caps. &quot;Kanabō&quot;-type weapons came in a wide variety of shapes and sizes; though the largest ones were as tall as a man, on average they measured roughly 55&quot; in length. The &quot;Kanabō&quot; was typically intended for two-handed use, though one-handed versions exist which are more usually referred to as tetsubō and ararebō. 

Their shape could be similar to that of a baseball bat, with a thicker outer end tapering towards a slender handle with a pommel, or, after the manner of a Jō, they could be straight all the way from the handle to the end. The shaft cross-section could be round (as in a baseball bat) or polygonal; that is, multi-faceted with flat surfaces arrayed around the central axis.

== Mythology ==
The &quot;kanabō&quot; was also a mythical weapon, often used in tales by &quot;oni&quot;, who reputedly possessed superhuman strength. This is alluded to by the Japanese saying &quot;like giving a &quot;kanabō&quot; to an &quot;oni&quot;—meaning to give an extra advantage to someone who already has the advantage (i.e. the strong made stronger).

<text>Lesser Armenia (; ; ), also known as Armenia Minor and Armenia Inferior, comprised the Armenian-populated regions primarily to the west and northwest of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia (also known as Kingdom of Greater Armenia), on the western side of the Euphrates River. It was also a kingdom, separate from Greater Armenia, from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD. The region was later reorganized into the Armeniac Theme under the Byzantine Empire.

==Geography==
Lesser Armenia (or Armenia Minor) was the portion of historic Armenia and the Armenian Highlands lying west and northwest of the river Euphrates. It received its name to distinguish it from the much larger eastern portion of historic Armenia—Greater Armenia (or Armenia Major).

==Early history==

Lesser Armenia corresponded to the location of the Late Bronze Age Hayasa-Azzi confederation, which is thought by some scholars to be the source of the Armenian endonym and the original state of the Proto-Armenians. It has been suggested that the epithet &quot;lesser&quot; indicates that this territory was the older homeland of the Armenian people, while &quot;greater&quot; Armenia referred to a territory that was later settled.

Lesser Armenia may have formed a part of the territories of the Orontid dynasty, which ruled Armenia first as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire and then as kings. However, there is no clear evidence to support this claim. Lesser Armenia emerged as a separate kingdom after the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC, although the exact origin, size and history of this kingdom are murky. The capital of this kingdom was probably originally at Kamakh, but likely moved to Nicopolis after the end of the Mithridatic Wars. Lesser Armenia apparently experienced the high point of its territorial expansion during the Orontid period, possibly expanding its borders to the Black Sea. According to Strabo, it originally had its own royal dynasty. It passed under the control of the Kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC, during the reign of Mithridates VI Eupator (), who built 75 fortresses there. After the Romans defeated Pontus in the Mithridatic Wars, Lesser Armenia became a client kingdom of Rome, who appointed various client kings to rule the kingdom. The last of these was Aristobulus of Chalcis of the Herodian dynasty. In 72 AD, Lesser Armenia was annexed by the Roman Empire and made a part of the larger province of Cappadocia.

==Roman and Byzantine Lesser Armenia==

All of Armenia became a Roman province in AD 114 under Roman emperor Trajan, but Roman Armenia was soon after abandoned by the legions in 118 AD and became a vassal kingdom. Lesser Armenia, however, was generally incorporated by Trajan, together with Melitene and Cataonia, into the province of Cappadocia. Lesser Armenia consisted of five districts: Orbalisene in the North; below that Aetulane; Aeretice; then Orsene; and finally Orbesine, the most southern. The more southern districts appended to Lesser Armenia were Meleiene, so called from its capital Melitene (modern Malatya) and the following four small districts of ancient Cataonia, namely, Aravene; Lavinianesine or Lavianesine; Cataonia, in the more restricted sense, or the country close upon Cilicia surrounded by mountains; finally, Muriane or Murianune, between Cataonia and Melitene, called likewise Bagadoania.

Lesser Armenia was reunited with the kingdom of Greater Armenia under the Arshakuni king Tiridates III in AD 287 until the temporary conquest of Shapur II in 337.

Then it was formed into a regular province under Diocletian, and in the 4th century, was divided in two provinces: First Armenia (Armenia Prima), which contained most of Lesser Armenia, and Second Armenia (Armenia Secunda) that comprised all the southern tracts which had been added to Lesser Armenia, with the exception of Cataonia, which was incorporated with Cappadocia Secunda.

Its population remained Armenian but was being gradually Romanized. Since the 3rd century many Armenian soldiers were in the Roman army: later–in the 4th century–they made up two Roman legions, the Legio I Armeniaca and the Legio II Armeniaca.

In 536, the emperor Justinian I reorganized the provincial administration, and First and Second Armenia were renamed Second and Third respectively, while some of their territory was split off to the other Armenian provinces.

The borders of the Byzantine part of Armenia were expanded in 591 into Persarmenia, but the region was the focus of decades of warfare between the Byzantines and the Persians (the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars) until the Arab conquest of Armenia in 639.

After this, the part of Lesser Armenia remaining under Byzantine control (in a lesser extent) became part of the theme of Armeniakon.

==Mongol and Ottoman influence==
After the downfall of Bagratid Armenia in 1045 and resulting subsequent losses of Byzantine Empire in the East after the Battle of Manzikert in 1073, Lesser Armenia fell to the Seljuks and then was part of the Mongol Empire for 92 years and of the Ottoman Empire from the late 15th century.

Between the 11th and 14th centuries, the term Lesser Armenia (sometimes called &quot;Little Armenia&quot;) was applied to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, right until the formation of Turkey in 1923.

== Episcopal sees ==

Ancient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Armenia Secunda (II) listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; as titular sees:
For ancient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Armenia Tertia (III), see Roman Armenia#Episcopal sees.

==Later history==
Lesser Armenia is traditionally considered as part of Western Armenia, especially after the acquisition of Eastern Armenia by the Russian Empire in the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828.

The Christian Armenian population of Lesser Armenia continued its existence in the area until the Armenian genocide of 1915–23. Some Armenians still live in the area, albeit converted to Islam under Ottoman influence, mainly in the 17th century.

<doc id="1145776" wikidata="Q6540935" url="?curid=1145776" title="Liberalism in Turkey">
<text>Liberalism was first introduced in the Ottoman Empire during the Tanzimat period (1839–1876) of reformation, following the Edict of Gülhane in 1839. The reforms encouraged Ottomanism among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire and attempted to curb the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire. This led to the Armenian National Constitution in 1863 and subsequently the Ottoman constitution of 1876 which was advocated for by the Young Ottomans. The Young Ottomans considered the modern parliamentary system to be a restatement &quot;shura&quot;, that had existed in early Islam.

The First Constitutional Era, ended two years later in 1878 when Sultan Abdül Hamid II, suspended the constitution and parliament in favor of a return to absolute monarchy. 

Citing social unrest in the wake of the Ottoman&#x27;s defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Abdul Hamid II took the opportunity to suspend parliament. Several decades later, another group of reform-minded Ottomans, called the Young Turks, repeated the Young Ottomans&#x27; efforts, leading to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era. Whereas the short First Constitutional Era lacked political parties, the second era initially featured unprecedented political pluralism within the empire and openly contested elections. 

==History==
On 30 May 1876, Murad V became the Sultan when his uncle Sultan Abdülaziz was deposed. He was highly influenced by French culture and was a liberal. He reigned for 93 days before being deposed on the grounds that he was supposedly mentally ill on 31 August 1876; however, his opponents may simply have used that as a pretext to stop his implementation of democratic reforms under a constitution.

=== Constitutional era ===
Constitutionalism was introduced in the Ottoman Empire by liberal intellectuals like Beşir Fuad, Hekim Ismail Pasha, and Ahmed Zühdü Pasha, who tried to modernize their society by promoting development, progress, and liberal values.
==== Tanzimât ====
The Tanzimât, literally meaning &quot;reorganization&quot; of the Ottoman Empire, was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876. Although the motives for the implementation of Tanzimât were bureaucratic, it was supported by Dimitrios Zambakos Pasha, Kabuli Mehmed Pasha, the Young Ottomans secret society, and Midhat Pasha, who is also often considered one of the founders of the Ottoman Parliament. Many changes were made to improve civil liberties, but many Muslims saw them as foreign influence on the world of Islam. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by the state. A policy called Ottomanism was meant to unite all the different peoples living in Ottoman territories, including Muslims and non-Muslims, Turkish, Greek, Armenian, and Jewish, Kurd, and Arab. The policy officially began with the Edict of Gülhane of 1839, declaring equality before the law for both Muslim and non-Muslim Ottomans.

The Tanzimât reforms began under Sultan Mahmud II. On November 3, 1839, Sultan Abdulmejid I issued a hatt-i sharif or imperial edict called the Edict of Gülhane or Tanzimât Fermânı. This was followed by several statutes enacting its policies. In the edict the Sultan stated that he wished &quot;to bring the benefits of a good administration to the provinces of the Ottoman Empire through new institutions.&quot; Among the reforms, were the abolition of slavery and slave trade, the decriminalization of homosexuality, the establishment of the Civil Service School, an institution of higher learning for civilians, the Press and Journalism Regulation Code, and the Nationality Law of 1869 which created a common Ottoman citizenship irrespective of religious or ethnic affiliation. Western-educated economists like Ahmet Reşat Pasha advocated for economic liberalism.

==== Young Ottomans ====

The Young Ottomans were a secret society established in 1865 by a group of Ottoman Turkish intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, which they believed did not go far enough, and wanted to end the autocracy in the empire. Young Ottomans sought to transform Ottoman society by preserving the empire and modernizing along the European tradition of adopting a constitutional government. Though the Young Ottomans were frequently in disagreement ideologically, they all agreed that the new constitutional government should continue to be somewhat rooted in Islam to emphasize &quot;the continuing and essential validity of Islam as the basis of Ottoman political culture.&quot; However, they combined Islamic idealism with modern liberalism and parliamentary democracy. The Young Ottomans believed European parliamentary liberalism was a model to follow, in accordance with the tenets of Islam and &quot;attempted to reconcile Islamic concepts of government with the ideas of Montesquieu, Danton, Rousseau, and contemporary European Scholars and statesmen.&quot; Namık Kemal, who was influential in the formation of the society, admired the constitution of the French Third Republic. He summed up the Young Ottomans&#x27; political ideals as &quot;the sovereignty of the nation, the separation of powers, the responsibility of officials, personal freedom, equality, freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of association, enjoyment of property, sanctity of the home&quot;. The Young Ottomans believed that one of the principal reasons for the decline of the empire was abandoning Islamic principles in favor of imitating European modernity with unadvised compromises to both and they sought to unite the two in a way that they believed would best serve the interests of the state and its people. They sought to revitalize the empire by incorporating certain Europeans models of government, while still retaining the Islamic foundations the empire was founded on. Among the prominent members of this society were writers and publicists such as İbrahim Şinasi, Namık Kemal, Ali Suavi, Ziya Pasha, and Agah Efendi.

In 1876, the Young Ottomans had their defining moment when Sultan Abdülhamid II reluctantly promulgated the Ottoman constitution of 1876 (), the first attempt at a constitution in the Ottoman Empire, ushering in the First Constitutional Era. Although this period was short lived, with Abdülhamid ultimately suspending the constitution and parliament in 1878 in favor of a return to absolute monarchy with himself in power, the legacy and influence of the Young Ottomans continued to endure until the collapse of the empire. Several decades later, another group of reform-minded Ottomans, namely the Young Turks, repeated the Young Ottomans&#x27; efforts, leading to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era.

===Timeline===

<text>William Caleb Yarborough (March 27, 1939 – December 31, 2023) was an American NASCAR Winston Cup Series driver and owner, businessman, farmer, and rancher. He was the first driver in NASCAR history to win three consecutive championships, winning in 1976, 1977, and 1978. He was one of the preeminent stock car drivers from the 1960s to the 1980s and also competed in IndyCar events. His fame was such that a special model of the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II was named after him.

His 83 wins tie him with Jimmie Johnson for sixth on the all-time NASCAR Cup Series winner&#x27;s list (behind Bobby Allison, who has 85 and Darrell Waltrip, who has 84). His 14.82% winning percentage is the ninth best of all-time and third among those with 500 or more starts. Yarborough won the Daytona 500 four times; his first win coming in 1968 for the Wood Brothers, the second in 1977 for Junior Johnson, and back-to-back wins in 1983 and 1984 for Ranier-Lundy Racing. Yarborough was a three-time winner of the National Motorsports Press Association Driver of the Year Award (1977, 1978, 1979). After retiring, he owned Cale Yarborough Motorsports and several successful agricultural businesses as well as being a rancher and farmer himself on his own ranch at his home in Florence, South Carolina.

==Beginnings==
Yarborough was born to Julian and Annie Yarborough in the tiny, unincorporated community of Sardis near Timmonsville, South Carolina, the oldest of three sons. Julian was a tobacco farmer, cotton gin operator, and store owner who was killed in a private airplane crash when Cale was twelve years of age. According to his autobiography &quot;Cale&quot;, Yarborough attended the second Southern 500 in 1951 as a young spectator without a ticket. Yarborough was a high school football star at Timmonsville High School and played semi-pro football in Columbia, South Carolina for four seasons and was a Golden Gloves boxer. He made his first attempt in the Southern 500 as a teenager by lying about his age, but he was caught and disqualified by NASCAR. In 1957, Yarborough made his debut as a driver at the Southern 500, driving the No. 30 Pontiac for Bob Weatherly, starting 44th and finishing 42nd after suffering hub problems. He ran for Weatherly two years later, and finished 27th. In 1960, Yarborough ran one race, and had his first career top-fifteen, a fourteenth-place finish at Southern States Fairgrounds. He again ran one race in 1961, finishing 30th in the Southern 500 driving for Julian Buesink. In 1962, Yarborough ran eight races for Buesink, Don Harrison, and Wildcat Williams. He earned his first top-ten at the Daytona 500 Qualifying Race, when he finished tenth.

==1960s==
Yarborough started 1963 without a full-time ride, but soon signed on to drive the No. 19 Ford for Herman Beam. His best finish was fifth twice, at Myrtle Beach and Savannah Speedway, respectively. He began the next season driving for Beam, but left and finished the year with Holman Moody, finishing sixth at North Wilkesboro Speedway, winding up 19th in points. The next season, he drove for various owners before picking up his first career win at Valdosta Speedway driving the #06 Ford for Kenny Myler, rising to 10th in the final standings.

Yarborough drove for Banjo Matthews at the beginning of 1966. Despite two consecutive second-place finishes, he left the team early in the season and ended the year driving the No. 21 Ford for the Wood Brothers. He won two races in 1967 at the Atlanta 500 and the Firecracker 400 for the Wood Brothers, but dropped to 20th in standings because he only ran 17 races. Yarborough also ran the Indianapolis 500 in 1966 and 1967 driving Vollstedt-Fords. After running the season-opening Middle Georgia 500 for Bud Moore Engineering, finishing 21st, Yarborough ran the rest of the season for the Wood Brothers, winning his first Daytona 500 in a duel with LeeRoy Yarbrough, the Firecracker 400, which made him the second driver in history to sweep both Daytona events, and his first Southern 500 garnering a total of six wins that season. Running a limited schedule, he finished 17th in points. The next season, he won his third straight Atlanta 500 along with the first NASCAR race at Michigan International Speedway the Motor State 500 and six pole positions.

In 1969, the Ford Motor Company produced a Cale Yarborough Special Edition Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II (and they also produced a Mercury Cyclone Spoiler). It was a white Mercury Cyclone (fastback) in white with a red roof and stripe. The Spoiler II was outfitted with a special aerodynamic front end. This was a limited edition homologation special that was made to satisfy the NASCAR 500-car minimum production regulations. There was only one engine choice available in the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, a 351 cubic inch Windsor; a very similar car was also produced by Mercury in 1969 as a white car with blue trim as the Dan Gurney Special.

==1970s==
Yarborough continued to drive a limited schedule for the Wood Brothers in 1970, winning his second consecutive Michigan 400 and the American 500 for the first time along with one of the Daytona 125-mile qualifying races and four poles. At the end of the season, Yarborough was released after Ford withdrew factory support for NASCAR teams. He drove four races in 1971, posting one top-ten in Daytona in the No. 3 Ray Fox-owned Plymouth. He also ran in the Indianapolis 500, finishing 16th in a Gene White-owned, Firestone-sponsored Mongoose-Ford. The next season, Yarborough ran five NASCAR races, his best finish coming at Michigan driving for James Hylton. He ended the season with two consecutive Top 10&#x27;s driving for Hoss Ellington. He also ran his final Indianapolis 500 in a Bill Daniels sponsored Atlanta-Foyt, finishing 10th. Yarborough mostly focused on driving USAC races in 1971 and 1972. In 1973, Yarborough returned to NASCAR and ran every NASCAR Grand National race in a season for the first time in his career, driving the No. 11 Kar-Kare Chevrolet for Richard Howard. He won four races, including his second Southern 500, the National 500 and the Southeastern 500 at Bristol in which he led every lap, and had 19 Top 10&#x27;s, finishing second in points.

In 1974, Yarborough won a career-high ten races, but lost the championship by nearly 600 points. Midway through the season, Yarborough&#x27;s team was bought by Junior Johnson with Carling sponsorship. Yarborough swept both races at Riverside International Raceway, captured his fourth Atlanta 500, and his second consecutive Southern 500 and third overall. Despite his successful 1974 campaign, the team began 1975 without major sponsorship, and missed three races, before Holly Farms became the team&#x27;s primary sponsor. He won three races, including sweeping the events at Rockingham, but dropped to ninth in the final standings.

The next 3 years would be Cale Yarborough&#x27;s time to shine. In 1976, he won nine races, including four in a row late in the season, along with winning the Firecracker 400, in winning his first career Winston Cup Championship. The 1977 season would be the greatest year in Cale Yarborough&#x27;s legendary career. Not only that he would go on to repeat his nine-win performance from 1976, but he finished every single race, and did not finish outside of the Top 6 during the last 14 races of the season. In just a 30-race schedule for 1977, he scored a total of 5000 points under the Winston Cup points system, earning him his second consecutive championship. He won the title by 386 points over Richard Petty. Yarborough became the first driver in NASCAR history to win the championship and NOT score a single DNF. Bobby Labonte would join Cale and become only the second driver to do the same thing in 2000. As of 2022, they are the only two drivers in history to do so. Yarborough led the Winston Cup points standings throughout the entire 1977 season, making him the only driver in NASCAR history to accomplish that feat. However, there was a tie in points after the very first race of the season. David Pearson went on to win the race at Riverside. Yarborough finished second, and he received the bonus points for leading the most laps. Both drivers were scored at 180 points each after Riverside. Technically, back in the Winston Cup points system, the tiebreaker would go to the driver who has the most wins. NASCAR listed Pearson as the points leader because he scored the season&#x27;s first win, but, he was also racing on a part-time schedule. They also listed Yarborough as the points leader because he was racing full-time and competing for the season&#x27;s championship, and more importantly, defending his championship from 1976. The 1977 season became the only year in NASCAR history to list two drivers as the points leader. Another highlight of the season was his second Daytona 500 victory, earning him a cover appearance on Sports Illustrated, the second NASCAR driver so honored. He also scored two victories in IROC IV, finishing second in the standings. In 1978, his team switched to Oldsmobiles and received new sponsorship from First National City Travelers Checks. He matched his previous career high of 10 wins from 1974, including leading every lap of the Music City USA 420, his fourth Southern 500 and first Winston 500 at Talladega, and went on to win his third consecutive NASCAR Winston Cup championship (clinching it at the American 500). Cale Yarborough became the very first driver in NASCAR history to win three consecutive championships. He clinched the 1978 championship with two races to go, becoming the second driver to win the title that early in the Winston Cup points system. Richard Petty clinched the 1975 championship with four races to go. In IROC V he captured one victory, finishing fourth in the standings.

Yarborough began the 1979 season with Busch Beer sponsorship and getting into a fight with Donnie and Bobby Allison after the Daytona 500, when Donnie and Yarborough wrecked while racing for the lead on the final lap. This was the first NASCAR 500-mile race to be broadcast on live television in its entirety (through CBS Sports). The confrontation and the exciting race that led up to it are credited with starting the mass growth of NASCAR.
Yarborough went on to finish fourth in the standings, winning four races, including the Coca-Cola 500 at Pocono Raceway and the National 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, one pole, and finishing third in the IROC VI standings.

==1980s==
Yarborough won a career-high and modern-era record 14 poles in 1980, captured six races including sweeping the events at Rockingham, and scoring wins at Bristol, Michigan, Texas and Atlanta. Yarborough barely missed out on his fourth championship in five years, losing the championship to Dale Earnhardt by 19 points. At the end of the season, Yarborough announced he was leaving the Junior Johnson team to spend more time with his family and would run a part-time schedule for the rest of his career. At the suggestion of Yarborough, he was replaced by Darrell Waltrip. Yarborough won 55 races while driving for Johnson from 1973 to 1980, compiling an amazing winning percentage of 26.57 percent.

Yarborough competed in 18 races in the 1981 season in the No. 27 Valvoline-sponsored Buick for M.C. Anderson, winning his fourth Firecracker 400 and his fifth Coca-Cola 500 at Atlanta, finishing in the Top 10 a total of 10 times. Yarborough competed in 16 races in 1982, winning three, including his hometown Southern 500 for the fifth and final time. He also ran the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans finishing 13 laps before a crash ended the team&#x27;s efforts.
In 1983, Anderson closed his operation, and Yarborough moved to the No. 28 Hardee&#x27;s-sponsored Chevrolet owned by Ranier-Lundy, competing in 16 events. He won four races, including his third Daytona 500, his sixth Atlanta Coca-Cola 500, and swept both events at Michigan, along with three poles. In 1984, he repeated by winning his fourth Daytona 500, becoming the second driver to score back-to-back wins, the Winston 500 at Talladega, a race that featured 75 lead changes, and the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500, along with four poles. Yarborough also captured the IROC VIII championship. In 1985, after his team switched to a Ford, he won his first Talladega 500 and scored his final win in the Miller High Life 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He also finished eighth in the final standings of IROC IX.

In 1986, Yarborough won his final career pole at the Firecracker 400, and had five Top 10 finishes. He scored a victory at Talladega during IROC X and finished third in the standings. In 1987, he left the Ranier-Lundy team and purchased Jack Beebe&#x27;s Race Hill Farm team. Yarborough took the Hardee&#x27;s sponsorship and began running the No. 29 Oldsmobile Delta 88 as an owner/driver, posting two Top 5 finishes. He ran his final season in 1988 in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, entering 10 races and posting two ninth-place finishes. He retired at the end of the year.

==Politics==
In 1972, Yarborough became the first Republican elected to the Florence County Council since Reconstruction. During the 1976 United States presidential election, he campaigned for his longtime friend, Jimmy Carter. That year, Yarborough was reelected to the county council, this time as a Democrat.

==Ownership==
In 1986 Yarborough purchased Jack Beebe&#x27;s Race Hill Farm team, renaming the team Cale Yarborough Motorsports and running a part-time schedule in 1987 and 1988. During the 1988 season, Yarborough split time in the No. 29 car with Dale Jarrett, who took over full-time in 1989 following Yarborough&#x27;s retirement.

For 1990, Jarrett was replaced by Dick Trickle in the renumbered No. 66 car, with backing from Phillips 66. The team won the pole at Dover International Speedway, finishing 24th in points. Multiple drivers raced for Yarborough in 1991, including Trickle, Lake Speed, Dorsey Schroeder, Chuck Bown, and Randy LaJoie. Chad Little, Bobby Hillin, Jr, and Jimmy Hensley would all drive the No. 66 in 1992, with Hensley winning Rookie of the Year honors.

In 1993, the team switched to the No. 98 with Bojangles&#x27; sponsorship and Derrike Cope behind the wheel, finishing 26th in points. Cope began 1994 with sponsorship from Fingerhut, but was replaced by Jeremy Mayfield after struggling.

RCA became the team&#x27;s new primary sponsor in 1995, and Mayfield finished 31st in points despite missing four races. In 1996, Mayfield had two top-five finishes and won the pole at Talladega Superspeedway. Towards the end of the season, Mayfield left to drive for Michael Kranefuss, whose previous driver John Andretti moved to the 98, finishing fifth at Martinsville Speedway. Andretti won the team&#x27;s second pole at Talladega in 1997, and at the 1997 Pepsi 400, he led 113 laps and won Yarborough&#x27;s only race as a car owner. 
Despite the win and a 23rd-place points finish, RCA left the sport and Andretti signed with Petty Enterprises. Yarborough signed Greg Sacks to drive his Thorn Apple Valley Ford in 1998, but Sacks suffered a neck injury at Texas Motor Speedway and was unable to race for the rest of the year. Rich Bickle took his place, and had a fourth-place finish at Martinsville. After the season Bickle resigned to drive for Tyler Jet Motorsports and Thorn Apple departed due to financial problems within the organization.

Due to the lack of financing, Yarborough originally closed his team, but soon reopened and hired Rick Mast as the driver, with car dealer Wayne Burdett joining as a co-owner. Despite having no primary sponsor, Yarborough and his team ran the full schedule, picking up short-term deals with Sonic Drive-In and Hobas Pipe. Soon after, Burdette left the team and the team signed Universal Studios/Woody Woodpecker as its primary sponsor. Mast posted two top-tens and did not have a DNF all season, the second driver since Yarborough to accomplish that feat. Despite rumors of a second team with Mike Ciochetti driving, Mast and Universal both departed following the season. In January 2000, Yarborough closed the team until a buyer could be found.

He sold the team in the summer of 2000 to Chip MacPherson. Renamed MacPherson Motorsports, the team ran 2 races with drivers Jeff Fuller and Geoffrey Bodine. Both drivers failed to finish the race and finished 41st. Soon afterward, the team disappeared from the Cup circuit.

Yarborough was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1994, the Court of Legends at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1996 and was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers (1998). In 2009, Yarborough was one of the 25 nominees for the first class to be inducted in the NASCAR Hall of Fame, though he was not selected. In 2010, he was nominated for induction in the second class of the Hall of Fame, and again he failed to make the cut. In 2011, Yarborough finally was elected to the NASCAR HOF. A stretch of South Carolina Highway 403 through Timmonsville is named Cale Yarborough Highway in his honor.

In March 2013, Yarborough was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==

<doc id="1145788" wikidata="Q1894990" url="?curid=1145788" title="Extension cord">
<text>An extension cord (US), extension cable, power extender, drop cord, or extension lead (UK) is a length of flexible electrical power cable (flex) with a plug on one end and one or more sockets on the other end (usually of the same type as the plug). The term usually refers to mains (household AC) extensions but is also used to refer to extensions for other types of cabling. If the plug and power outlet are of different types, the term &quot;adapter cord&quot; may be used. Most extension cords range from around in length although they are made up to in length.

The term &quot;extension cord&quot; has been in use since at least 1925.

Extension cords come in various colors, lengths, thicknesses and service duties. In general, the more power needed by the appliance, the thicker the cord needs to be (meaning larger wires inside). Cords which will be used outdoors, in wet areas, around oils, or exposed to sunlight for long periods of time should be selected for such specific conditions.
An extension reel is an extension lead that rolls up, usually into the socket end, which in some cases has more than one socket on it (often 2 or 4). Another type of extension reel hangs near the plug end and permits the user to draw the cord out by grasping the socket end.

Some extension cords also incorporate safety features such as a polarized plug and receptacle, grounded terminals, a &quot;power-on&quot; indicator, a fusible link, or even a residual-current device (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).

Some cords contain multiple female connectors in close proximity of one another; others have female connectors spaced along the length of the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded female socket, this is unsafe.

== Variations ==
A power strip is a block on the end of a power cable with a number of sockets (usually 3 or more), often arranged in a line. This term is also used to refer to the whole unit of a short extension cord terminating in a power strip.

A removable power cord is similar but much shorter, and is designed to connect an appliance to a mains outlet. The female end mates with an appliance inlet.

==Regulations==

=== National Electrical Code (US)===
In the United States the domestic voltage is 120 V, and the National Electrical Code (NEC) prohibits the use of extension cords in a 20 A circuit unless they are of 16 AWG or larger diameter (for example, 14 AWG or 12 AWG).

As with other flexible cords, the NEC also prohibits their use where attached to building surfaces, concealed inside structures (walls, floors, ceilings), above suspended ceilings, or run through holes or other openings (windows, doors) in structures. The NEC does contain exceptions although they are very limited.


Within the United States, Underwriters Laboratories certifies extension cords as complying with the NEC. Key standards are UL 817 for the entire extension cord, and UL 62 for the electrical cabling itself. The United States General Services Administration also maintains a standard for extension cords, J-C-1270, that references the UL standards and provides additional criteria.

The NEC tries to reduce potential fire hazards by requiring that there be a receptacle within of every point along the wall in residences, reducing the need for extension cords. However, even in houses with more receptacles than the code requires, there will sometimes be a need for extension cords.

=== Europe===

In Europe and elsewhere where the normal domestic voltage is around 230 V there may be less risk of causing fire through overheating of cables for any given power due to the lower current. However most European extension reel cables now include an automatic current cut-out to avoid misuse of the cable. This requires manual resetting if excess current is drawn through the cable. (American multi-plug cords also include such a device, but single- or triple-outlet cords do not.)

==Hazards==

Fire incident history research has shown that a large proportion of structure fires are caused by extension cords that have been either damaged or overloaded.

The insulation of extension cords, particularly light-duty two-wire cords, is easily damaged by being pinched, crushed, or abraded. The cords can also be damaged at the plug and socket connections by being pulled on excessively, which sometimes happens when people trip on them. Overloading can cause an extension cord to heat up to the point that its insulation either melts or carbonizes. Heating appliances may also cause heat damage to the insulation of a cord, melting or burning it away.

If the internal metal wires are damaged, such as by the cord being crushed in a door, then where the unbroken part of the wires is narrower than the bulk of the wires, this can form a point of high resistance. A hot spot may develop as the resistance of the narrower part of the wire is higher than the rest of the wire, and thus tends to concentrate power dissipation there.

Animals may chew on the wires and remove some of the insulation. In any of these cases if the damage is not noticed and the cord is not repaired or taken out of service, the damage can lead to arcing or a short circuit between the wires, which can ignite nearby materials. The exposed wires of an extension cord with damaged insulation can also present a shock hazard to people and animals.

==Safety==
Cords running across the floor should be covered with a suitable device to protect them from physical damage. However, they should never be covered with a rug or carpet, as this can produce a serious fire hazard.

To avoid the need for rolling-up excess length, using an extension reel or for cutting the cord to size, extension cords are sold in prefabricated lengths of . Every foot of cord increases the electrical resistance, in turn decreasing the power the cord can deliver. Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger the diameter of the conductors needed to minimise voltage drop (wire gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire). Because of this, it is best to use a cord that&#x27;s exactly as long as needed and no more.

An extension reel can only carry full rated current when completely extended. This is because the portion of cord on the reel is not exposed to air causing the loss power, (the result of its series resistance), not to dissipate. An extension cord that is in use while coiled up or coiled in a reel can be a serious shock and fire hazard. The heat produced from the resistance cannot dissipate and is instead trapped between the tightly coiled cable, leading to the a fire or shock. Additionally, the ESFI recommends to never use an extension cord that is covered by a rug or blanket, or that is run through a ceiling or wall, since the heat may not be able to dissipate appropriately.

==Lead content==

Extension cords sold in the United States may contain lead in the PVC insulation sheathing. California Proposition 65 (1986) requires manufacturers to warn consumers when products contain toxic chemicals. Many extension cords carry warning labels that advise consumers to wash their hands after handling them.

The European directive, RoHS, restricts the use of hazardous materials like lead in the manufacture of electrical products such as extension cords. Some manufacturers have moved to RoHS compliance but there is currently no widespread movement in the US to stop the manufacture of products containing lead.

==Maintenance==

The attention required to safely use an extension cord includes routing extension cords away from where they are likely to be damaged, using the shortest cord that will serve each intended purpose, and examining the cords periodically for damage or signs of overloading (melting deformation, darkening in color, or a “burnt” or “electrical” smell).

Periodic inspection is especially important for cords that may be used in place for a long time, for instance behind furniture, where damage may go unnoticed and by chance conditions are right for a fire or electrical shock incident to occur (e.g. some dust or paper falls near the arcing wire, or a liquid spill occurs and flows to the exposed wire).

Another dangerous modification to an extension cord is removing the third prong in order to fit sockets, which results in removing of the grounding prong, as well as loss of the hot/neutral prong distinction.

==Signal cable extenders==


Extension cords sometimes refer to cables that add to the length of signal transmission cables or combined signal/electrical cables (for example, USB cables). They are more likely to be called &quot;extenders&quot; or &quot;extender cables&quot; or &quot;cable extenders&quot;. Such extenders have one male and one female connector.

Passive USB extender cables do not meet the USB standards and thus are forbidden to carry the USB logo. The only cable structure recognized by the official USB standards is one with either a type A plug or a type C plug on one end, and either a type B plug or a type C plug on the other end (adapters with a type C plug and a type A or type B socket are also allowed, while adapters with a type C socket and a type A or type B plug or socket are explicitly not allowed). This restriction is intended to prevent cable lengths greater than the maximum allowed by the USB standard from being assembled and to avoid an accumulation of resistance in the connections exceeding the design limits of USB, in order to ensure consistent plug-and-play operation of the USB system without the need for users to calculate cable lengths or enforce technical rules.

The intention of USB is to make sure any standard-compliant cable can be used to connect any two compatible devices, and the connection will work, without question. To this end, the USB standard limits the maximum length of any compliant (and thus logo-bearing) USB cable (to about 15 feet). For a longer cable length, a USB hub is required. Despite being nonstandard, these extender cables are readily available from many sources.

Another class of USB extenders are actually USB hubs with a length of cable permanently attached. These do comply with the USB standard, if not more than a limited number of them are connected together. However, they require power from the USB connection and so may reduce the power available for the device at the &quot;B&quot; end.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Cyprus]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme, it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
The First Liberal Party to be formed in Cyprus was the Liberal Party by former Foreign Minister of Cyprus Nicos Rolandis who served in this position under two governments. Rolandis was also elected President of the Liberals International in 1993. The Liberal Party; however, merged with the centre-right Democratic Rally in 1998

==History==
Nowadays there are two political parties in Cyprus representing the Liberal ideology, the Liberal Democratic Movement (Kinima Filelertheron Dimmokrato)( affiliated to the Interlibertarians ) who are a right of centre Liberal Party and claim to be a continuation of the first Liberal Party in Cyprus and the United Democrats (Enomeni Dimokrates, member ELDR) are a left of center liberal party.

<text>The Source is a historical novel by James A. Michener published in 1965. It is a survey of the history of the Jewish people and the land of Israel from pre-monotheistic days through the birth of the modern State of Israel and up until 1964. &quot;The Source&quot; uses, for its central device, a fictional &quot;tell&quot; (mound/hill) in northern Israel called &quot;Makor&quot; (, &quot;source&quot;). Prosaically, the name comes from a freshwater well just north of Makor, but symbolically it stands for much more, historically and spiritually.

Unlike most Michener novels, this book is not in strict chronological order. A parallel frame story set in Israel in the 1960s supports the historical timeline. Archaeologists digging at the &quot;tell&quot; at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The book follows the story of the Family of Ur from a Stone Age family whose wife begins to believe that there is a supernatural force, which slowly leads us to the beginnings of monotheism. The descendants are not aware of the ancient antecedents revealed to the reader by the all-knowing writer as the story progresses through the Davidic kingdom, Hellenistic times, Roman times, etc. The site is continually inhabited until the end of the Crusades when it is destroyed by the victorious Mameluks (as happened to many actual cities after 1291) and is not rebuilt by the Ottomans.

==Chapter list==
#The Tell — 1963, three archeologists, a Jew, a Catholic, and a Muslim, are at a modern archeological dig. The story moves back and forth between the historical chapters and the modern dig at the &quot;tell&quot; at Makor.
#The Bee-Eater (Level XV, 9831 BCE) — Introduction to the Ur family in Stone Age times and their first move into an agricultural society.
#Of Death and Life (Level XIV, 2202 BCE) — Starting prior to 2000 BCE, the concept of an ultimate supreme being takes root with the introduction of the Cult of El, as are some barbaric and mystic practices, like child sacrifice and temple prostitution.
#An Old Man and His God — Bronze Age, an early view of Hebrews as they moved from the desert life into Canaan and brought along the early teachings of El Shaddai. Makor is sacked by the Hebrews in 1491 BCE.
#Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird — Takes place 1040–970 BCE, during the last years of King David.
#The Voice of Gomer — 605–562 BCE. Following the Egyptian defeat at the Battle of Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar II marches into the Levant and deports the Jews to Babylon.
#In the Gymnasium — 222–187 BCE, Jewish life under the Seleucid Empire.
#King of the Jews — 74 BCE – 4 CE: this chapter is told in epistolary form and describes the rise of the ambitious Herod the Great and his eventual descent into madness.
#Yigal and His Three Generals — 12–70 CE: this chapter begins with the rule of the mad Caligula and his attempt to force idolatry on the Jews. After his death, he was replaced by the madder Nero, who ordered Vespasian to repress Josephus and the First Jewish–Roman War.
#The Law — This chapter takes place after the Empress Helena&#x27;s pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Christianity is being forced in Galilee as churches are mass-produced. This chapter is about two Jews who convert to Christianity due to the strictness of the Talmud (during this time the Gemara is being written), but are soon disenfranchised by the Christian Schism. This chapter is also the fictional origin of St. Mark.
#A Day in the Life of a Desert Rider — This chapter begins with the introduction of Islam to the Holy Land by Muslim conquests.
#Volkmar — This chapter opens with Peter the Hermit as he travels the European countryside in search of participants for the ill-fated People&#x27;s Crusade. It concludes with the First Crusade and the Siege of Jerusalem.
#The Fires of Ma Coeur — In 1291, the last crusader strongholds begin to fall to the Mamaluks. The final stronghold is Acre.
#The Saintly Men of Safed — This chapter focuses on the three Rabbis who meet in Safed while escaping the Spanish Inquisition and European pogroms, and their culture clashes between Sephardim, Ashkenazim and Kabbalistic traditions.
#Twilight of an Empire — In the 1880s the Ottoman Empire is falling apart and this chapter delves into the deep corruption in the public administration and Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s backlash at reform.
#Rebbe Itzik and the Sabra — 1948 — The new state of Israel starts to emerge. This chapter deals with the origins of two characters in the present day narrative – Ilan Eliav and Vered Bar El.
#The Tell — culmination of the novel and rediscovery of the well built and described in the previous chapter, Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird.

==Recurring symbols and themes==

===Fertility/The phallus===
In the early civilizations, the concept of fertility sprouts from agriculture and the desire for a fruitful harvest. During the earliest layer of history, the giant stone idol named El is created to please the earth and bring good crops.

As society moves away from a rural and agricultural existence, fertility is given less and less importance. The phallus is present from the Stone Age (&quot;The Bee Eater&quot;), until 606 BCE (&quot;The Voice of Gomer&quot;).

===Prayer===
Later, as modern Judaism begins to take form, the theme of dedication and tenacity is brought forward again and again. The final words of many of the book&#x27;s characters are of prayer; they are defending their religion with their life. As anti-Semitism becomes more prevalent, this theme grows stronger, as if to show the strength of the faith that the Jewish people hold.

<doc id="1145800" wikidata="Q844506" url="?curid=1145800" title="Me, Myself &amp; Irene">
<text>Me, Myself &amp; Irene is a 2000 American slapstick romantic black comedy film directed by the Farrelly brothers, and starring Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger. Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Richard Jenkins, Daniel Greene, Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon and Mongo Brownlee co-star. The film is about a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie who, after years of continuously suppressing his rage and feelings, suffers a psychotic breakdown that results in a second personality, Hank. This was Carrey&#x27;s first role in a 20th Century Fox film, along with being the Farrelly brothers&#x27; second film with Carrey since &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994). Filming was done from May 11 to July 29, 1999 in various locations in Rhode Island and Vermont. It was a box office success but received mixed critic reviews.

==Plot==
Meek veteran Rhode Island state trooper Charlie Baileygates has been taken advantage of by those around him, including his wife Layla. Almost immediately after their wedding, she begins to cheat on Charlie with their wedding limo chauffeur, Shonté, a black dwarf with a genius-level IQ.

Despite his friends warning him of Layla&#x27;s infidelity, Charlie denies it, even after she gives birth to biracial triplets, Jamal, Lee Harvey, and Shonté Jr., who also appear to be geniuses. A few years later, Layla leaves with Shonté, abandoning the children with Charlie, who raises them as his own. While they love and respect Charlie, the rest of the town continually abuses him. After years of such treatment, he develops a split personality named &quot;Hank Evans&quot; to deal with confrontations Charlie avoids: Emerging whenever Charlie is under extreme stress, Hank is an over-the-top, rude, and violent persona reminiscent of characters played by Clint Eastwood. A psychiatrist prescribes medication to keep Hank suppressed.

Believing Charlie needs a vacation, his commanding officer orders him to escort beautiful Irene Waters from Rhode Island to Massena, New York, where she reportedly committed a hit-and-run. Irene insists her mob-connected ex-boyfriend Dickie fabricated the accusation to keep her from revealing his illegal activities to the authorities.

In Massena, Charlie turns over Irene to two EPA agents. A hitman with a contract on Irene kills one of the agents. She and Charlie flee, hastily leaving his medication behind, which causes Hank to emerge frequently. Charlie is unjustly blamed for the murder. FBI agents begin pursuing him and Irene, as do Boshane and Gerke, two crooked police officers on Dickie&#x27;s payroll. The chase becomes a media spectacle, alerting Charlie&#x27;s sons to his predicament.

Charlie and Irene return to Rhode Island, bonding along the way. Although Irene is taken by Charlie&#x27;s personality, Hank worries her, as his aggressive personality and overestimation of his own toughness often gets them into trouble. Along the way, they pick up &quot;Whitey&quot;, an albino waiter who claims to have killed his entire family. While stopping at a motel, Hank convinces Irene to have sex with him by impersonating Charlie. When Charlie realizes what happened the next morning, he is incensed and begins fighting with Hank. They are almost ambushed by Boshane and Gerke, but Charlie&#x27;s sons, having found them, steal a police helicopter and call in a false report, stating Charlie and Irene have been apprehended in the woods nearby.

Charlie and Irene leave Whitey at the motel and board a train to Rhode Island. Dickie boards the same train, having been ordered by his police allies to &quot;get his hands dirty&quot;. He kidnaps Irene, and Charlie chases him, working together with Hank to save her. Hank balks when Dickie heads onto a bridge, but Charlie finally faces his fears, thus permanently nullifying Hank. As Charlie tries to disarm Dickie, Dickie shoots off Charlie&#x27;s thumb. Whitey then throws a lawn dart at Dickie, hitting him from behind and killing him.

Charlie and Irene fall from the bridge into the river below, where his sons arrive to rescue them. Regrouping with Whitey, Charlie apologizes for making him kill again, but Whitey reveals he made up his backstory, fearing Hank. The police arrive, quickly learning of Irene&#x27;s plight. Gerke and Boshane are arrested, Charlie is praised for bringing them to justice, and Irene is cleared of the charges against her.

Irene prepares to leave Rhode Island when the police pull her over, but this is only a diversion so Charlie can propose, which she happily accepts.

In a post-credits scene, everyone looks for Charlie&#x27;s thumb in the river. Whitey finds it, but a fish eats it.

==Home media==
&quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; was released on VHS on January 9, 2001, and on DVD on January 23, 2001. It was later released on Blu-ray on February 5, 2008.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; opened at No.1 on the weekend of June 23, 2000 ahead of &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, making US$24.2 million in its opening weekend.

The film earned $90,570,999 in the United States, and a further $58,700,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $149,270,999.

===Critical response ===

Review website Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; a score of 48%, based on 101 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10, with the consensus that &quot;While Jim Carrey&#x27;s comedic skills earn some laughs, &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; sports a tired, unsatisfying plot.&quot; Online review aggregator Metacritic states the film has a score of 49 out of a possible 100, based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Carrey included the movie in his top five favourite movies of his own, coming in second behind &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;.

===Controversy===
On June 9, 2000, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) sent a letter to 20th Century Fox, arguing that the film contains an inaccurate portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder. In the letter, NAMI executive president Lauire Flynn argued that &quot;&quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; perpetuates a myth that schizophrenia—a severe, biologically-based brain disorder—is a split personality&quot;, and criticized how Fox was &quot;seeking to dismiss such concerns with claims that the film is &#x27;only a comedy&#x27;&quot;, stating that &quot;for millions of Americans, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses are no laughing matter&quot;. NAMI asked Fox to release Public Service Announcements explaining real-life schizophrenia and DID, as well as Jim Carrey to explain the differences between schizophrenia and DID during interviews promoting the film.

<text>Levi Ziegler Leiter (November 2, 1834 – June 9, 1904) was an American businessman based in Chicago. He co-founded what later became the Marshall Field &amp; Company retail empire.

==Early life ==
Leiter was born to Anne (née Ziegler) and Joseph Thomas Leiter, of Leitersburg, the Washington County, Maryland town founded by his granduncle Andrew Leiter. Although some have confused Leiter&#x27;s ancestry as Jewish, his family was in fact of Swiss descent; he was raised a Lutheran.

==Career==
As a boy, Leiter worked for a dry goods business in Springfield, Ohio. In 1853 he began working as a bookkeeper at Chicago&#x27;s then-largest dry goods company, Cooley, Wadsworth &amp; Co., where he worked alongside Marshall Field and Potter Palmer. Leiter and Field became partners in the firm, but in 1865, they sold their interest in the company to John V. Farwell and went into business, along with Palmer, as Field, Palmer, Leiter &amp; Co.

In 1867, Palmer left his business to pursue real estate ventures, and the company was renamed Field, Leiter &amp; Co. Field &amp; Leiter built a six-story store on State Street in 1868. It was rebuilt after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. From 1874 to 1880, Leiter was a member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, which helped collect and distribute funds to rebuild Chicago after the fire. When Leiter sold his interest to Field and retired from the dry goods business in 1881, the name was changed to Marshall Field and Company.

As Leiter&#x27;s wealth increased, he invested much of his savings in Chicago real estate. After retirement from Field, Leiter &amp; Co., he devoted his attention to real estate and corporate interests. He later devoted time to travel and philanthropy. He was the first president of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the second president of the Chicago Art Institute, a president of the Chicago Historical Society, and a prominent figure in the Illinois Trust Company.

===Joseph Leiter===

From 1892 to 1898, his son Joseph was his agent. Joseph attempted to corner the wheat market from 1897 to 1898, and was briefly the largest individual holder of wheat in the history of the grain trade. Concerted action by his competitors broke the corner. Levi paid millions of dollars to settle Joseph&#x27;s debts after the market crashed in 1898. Levi&#x27;s losses were reputed to run to $10 million. Joseph was later the founder of the company town of Zeigler, Illinois, and president of the Zeigler Coal Company and the Chicago, Zeigler and Gulf Railway Company; he was also a director of the American Security and Trust Company.

==Personal life==
In 1866, Leiter married Mary Theresa Carver (1844–1913) of Chicago. From 1885 until her death, she served as the second Vice Regent for Illinois in the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, which is occupied with the preservation of George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon estate. Together, they were the parents of:

* Joseph Leiter (1868–1932), who married Juliette Williams (1887–1942).
* Mary Victoria Leiter (1870–1906), who married the British Conservative statesman George Nathaniel Curzon, Viceroy of India, later the 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston and ultimately 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston; she was thus Vicereine of India between 1899 and 1905.
* Nancy Lathrop Carver Leiter (1873–1930), who married Colin Powys Campbell (1859–1923).
* Margaret Hyde Leiter (1880–1968), who married Henry Molineux Howard (1877–1917), the 19th Earl of Suffolk and 12th Earl of Berkshire.

Leiter died of heart disease at the Vanderbilt family cottage in Bar Harbor, Maine on June 9, 1904. His estate became the subject of eight years of litigation.

===Washington residence===

In 1891, Leiter had a mansion built adjacent to Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. This home, the Leiter House, was designed by Theophilus P. Chandler. After his death, his D.C. home was used for elaborate parties hosted by his widow. During WWII, the mansion was leased to the U.S. Government for office space. The property was sold and the structure was demolished in 1947. The site is now the location of the Dupont Hotel.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter, he was the maternal grandfather of Lady Irene Curzon (later Baroness Ravensdale; 1896–1966); Lady Cynthia Curzon (1898–1933), the first wife of Sir Oswald Mosley; and Alexandra Curzon (1904–1995), the wife of Edward Dudley Metcalfe, the best friend, best man and equerry of King Edward VIII.

Through his daughter Margaret, he was the maternal grandfather of Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk (1906–1941); Hon. Cecil John Arthur Howard (1908–1985), married Frances Dean; and Lt.-Cdr. Hon. Greville Reginald Howard (1909–1987).

<text>Anatole Kaletsky (born 1 June 1952) is an economist and journalist based in the United Kingdom. He has written since 1976 for &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Times of London&quot; before joining Reuters and &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot; in 2012. He has been named Newspaper Commentator of the Year in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; awards, and has twice received the British Press Award for Specialist Writer of the Year.

Kaletsky has been an economic consultant since 1997, providing policy analysis and asset allocation advice to over 800 financial institutions, multinational companies and international organisations through his company, Gavekal, which is co-run with Louis and Charles Gave. He was elected to the governing Council of the Royal Economic Society in 1998.

==Early life==
Kaletsky was born in 1952 in Moscow, USSR and also spent his childhood in Poland and Australia. He has lived in England and the US since 1966.

==Education==
Kaletsky was educated at Westminster City School, at that time a grammar school in the City of Westminster in central London, followed by King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Mathematics, and then at Harvard, where he was a Kennedy Memorial Scholar and gained a master&#x27;s degree in economics.

==Life and career==
In 1976, Kaletsky joined &quot;The Economist&quot;, writing about business and finance. Three years later he moved to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, working in a variety of posts including New York Bureau Chief, Washington Correspondent, International Economics Correspondent and Moscow Correspondent.

Beginning in 1990, Kaletsky was Economics Editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, and later became Editor-at-Large. In early 2012, Kaletsky began his new post, in the Analysis and Opinion section of the Reuters online newspaper, where he wrote a weekly column. His articles also appeared in print around the world in the International New York Times. Since early 2015, Kaletsky has been writing for Project Syndicate and Prospect Magazine.

He was a full-time journalist for &quot;The Times,&quot; &quot;The Economist,&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; from 1976 to 1998. He was named Newspaper Commentator of the Year, Economic Journalist of the Year, European Journalist of the Year and Specialist Writer of the Year.

By 2012 he was writing a column for &quot;The Times of London&quot; and serving as editor at large, joining as an economics editor in 1990.

In 2012, Kaletsky left the &quot;Times of London&quot; to become a Reuters columnist.

In 2010, Kaletsky suggested the emergence of a new form of capitalism, which he calls Capitalism 4.0. The book&#x27;s writing was primarily influenced by the subprime mortgage crises of 2007 to 2009; and draws upon the pattern or the fallibility of capitalism. In his book &quot;Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis&quot;, Kaletsky suggests that capitalism is &quot;not a static set of institutions but an evolutionary system that reinvents and reinvigorates itself through crisis. He published the &quot;controversial&quot; book &quot;Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis&quot; in 2011, putting the 2007 to 2009 recession into &quot;historical and ideological perspective.&quot;

In 2012, Kaletsky was appointed Chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a foundation established after the 2008 financial crisis with $200 million of grants from George Soros, Paul Volcker, William Janeway, Jim Balsillie and other financiers. INET was set up post-crisis to challenge the mainstream assumptions in contemporary economic research.

On his Reuters&#x27; blog, Kaletsky appealed several times to the central banks to do &quot;quantitative easing for the people&quot;. This solution would consist in enabling central banks to create debt-free money and inject it into the economy through direct cash transfers to the citizens (i.e. helicopter money), instead of injecting money through the banking system. Kaletsky claims this radical solution &quot;may be another idea whose time has come&quot;.

As China experienced a period of stock market turbulence in the summer of 2015 worsened by &quot;economic weakness, financial panic, and the policy response to these problems,&quot; Kalestsky disagreed with those who claimed that China was the &quot;global economy’s weakest link.&quot; He claimed that &quot;weak economic data leads to financial turmoil, which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic, economic weakness, and policy mistakes.&quot;

In Project Syndicate in February 2016, Kaletsky confidently but incorrectly predicted that Britain would not vote to leave the European Union. In March 2020, he spoke at the Investment Week Funds to Watch conference, talking about projected effects of coronavirus. He is a board member of the organization Best for Britain. He continues to write for the &quot;Business Times.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kaletsky is married to Fiona Murphy, a documentary film producer, and they have three children: Kitty, Misha, and Sasha.
