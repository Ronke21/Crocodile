<text>Heaven&#x27;z Movie is the first solo studio album by American rapper Bizzy Bone. It was released on October 6, 1998, via Ruthless/Relativity Records. The recording sessions took place at Ocean Way and at Groove Mine in Nashville, and at Music Grinder and at Studio 56 in Los Angeles. The production was handled by Bizzy Bone himself under his B.B. Gambini alias together with Mike Smoov, Johnny &quot;J&quot;, Mafisto, Erik Nordquist, Cat Cody, Nina and Mike Johnson. It features guest appearances from Cat Cody, H.I.T.L.A.H. Capo-Confuscious and Mr. Majesty. The album reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States, selling 130,000 units in its first week. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America a month after its release date. The album is dedicated to the memory of Byron &quot;Big B&quot; Carlos McCane.

The songs &quot;Marchin&#x27; on Washington&quot;, &quot;Roll Call&quot;, &quot;Yes Yes Y&#x27;all&quot; and &quot;Brain on Drugs&quot; were cut short due to sample clearances not being made on time. Many songs did not make the album in time, leaving &quot;Heaven&#x27;z Movie&quot; incomplete. Songs omitted included the Tupac Shakur tribute &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, &quot;Trials &amp; Tribulations&quot;, &quot;Walking In Da Cold&quot;, &quot;Way 2 Strong&quot; from &quot;The PJs: Music from &amp; Inspired by the Hit Television Series&quot;, &quot;Relentless&quot;, &quot;Retaliation&quot;, &quot;Praise The Lord, Pass The Ammunition&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;War Time&quot;, &quot;Murder, Murder&quot;, &quot;These Are My Family&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;10 Commandments&quot;, &quot;Dying&quot;, &quot;Mercenary&quot;, &quot;Surrender My Love&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Heaven&#x27;z Movie&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Many reviewers criticized the cutting short of four prominent tracks (&quot;Roll Call&quot;, &quot;March On Washington&quot;, &quot;Yes, Yes Ya&#x27;ll&quot;, &quot;Brain On Drugs&quot;) due to sample clearances. Matt Diehl of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B− rating, stating &quot;Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s youngest member continues their formula of hip-hop harmony, fire-and-brimstone spirituality, and roughneck rhymes on his solo debut. Bizzy Bone also throws in inner-city cautionary tales (&quot;Social Studies&quot;) and flirts dangerously with fascism (check out guest H.I.T.L.A.H. Capo — Confucius&#x27; handle). Any enlightening messages in &quot;Heaven&#x27;z Movie&quot; are made unintelligible by Bizzy&#x27;s over-the-speed-limit rapping, which will satisfy Bone Thugs aficionados — but confuse everyone else&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier wrote: &quot;One of the more troubled members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Bizzy Bone takes the opportunity presented to him by his solo debut to explore much of his personal life. It&#x27;s a fairly naked album, often confessional and, relative to his work with Bone, very serious. As such, it&#x27;s an album orientated mostly toward Bone fans curious about the group&#x27;s respective inner workings&quot;.

<doc id="1149495" wikidata="Q3663706" url="?curid=1149495" title="Operación Triunfo (Spanish TV series)">
<text>Operación Triunfo () is a reality television talent show which first aired on Spain&#x27;s TVE network in 2001. A music talent contest with viewer voting and reality show elements that originated Endemol&#x27;s &quot;Star Academy&quot; franchise, the show aims to find the country&#x27;s next solo singing sensation.

&quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; (also known as &quot;OT&quot;) first aired in 2001. On its first run between 2001 and 2004, three series were aired on TVE, which also served as the national final to select the Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. The first series of &quot;OT&quot; was particularly successful in ratings, becoming one of the most popular shows in the history of Spanish television and featuring singers that went on to enjoy long-term recognition from the public: notably Rosa López, David Bisbal, David Bustamante or Chenoa. After the third series, TVE decided not to renew the show and its rights were acquired by Telecinco, which aired series 5–8 of the series. Series 8 in 2011 was cancelled due to poor ratings and its finale was rushed as a result.

On 26 April 2017, RTVE approved a new series of the talent show produced by Gestmusic Endemol, returning to TVE after 13 years. The total cost of the series was €10.2million. Due to its ratings success, it was renewed for a further series. This was the second most successful edition of the program to date, artists like Aitana, Ana Guerra, Amaia, Alfred García, Luis Cepeda, Agoney, Miriam Rodríguez or Lola Índigo have emerged from this edition.

In 2023, Amazon Prime Video acquired the rights to air the twelfth series. Shortly after the conclusion of this series, it was announced that Amazon had picked up the show for a thirteenth season. It is scheduled to premiere in September 2025.

== Format ==
A selection of hopefuls is boarded in &quot;The Academy&quot;, managed by a headmaster, where they are coached by various professionals in several artistic disciplines and are filmed with cameras (an idea borrowed from another of Endemol&#x27;s major reality shows &quot;Big Brother&quot;). Once a week, the contestants have to face a prime time show, where they sing a cover version of a popular song they have prepared during the week before, as well as recapping their trials and tribulations at The Academy from the past week. The live show will often feature special guest stars, with whom some of the contestants have the opportunity to sing. Based on the judges&#x27; verdicts and viewer voting, the weakest contestant is dropped. The eventual winner is awarded a record deal and/or some amount of money.

== Series overview ==

=== Series 1 (2001–02) ===

All three finalists of the inaugural series released debut albums, but while Rosa (accompanied by some fellow contenders as backing singers) scored seventh place in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 with the song &quot;Europe&#x27;s Living a Celebration&quot;, and had notable success with her albums, it was Bisbal who went on to international success, even winning a Latin Grammy Award for Best Newcomer for his album &quot;Corazón Latino&quot;.

Other participants of this first edition (Chenoa, Nuria Fergó and Manu Tenorio) also launched successful solo careers. In addition, Gisela was hired by Disney Spain and started a career in musical theater; and represented Andorra in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008.
=== Series 2 (2002–03) ===

The second series of &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; became an anomaly in the category of popular reality TV music shows. First of all, the winner had very little success after the show. Second of all, many contestants who did not do well had massive success across Europe and Latin America, not just in Spain:

Beth was chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. She scored 8th place with the song &quot;Dime&quot;.

The first person out of the show, Mai Meneses, rose to prominence in 2006 when herself and a childhood friend formed the band Nena Daconte. They released an album, &quot;He Perdido Los Zapatos&quot;, which was highly praised by critics. The album sold over 200,000 copies in Spain alone, an amazing feat as an average album to get to number 1 in Spain needs around 20,000 sales.

Vega, who came 9th, managed to release the best selling single of 2003 in Spain with her own composition, &quot;iGrita!&quot;, with over one million copies sold.
=== Series 3 (2003–04) ===

Series three runner-up Ramón was chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. He scored 10th place with the song &quot;Para llenarme de ti&quot;.

This was the last series aired by TVE until 2017, and the one with the lowest ratings until 2011.
=== Series 4 (2005) ===

TVE refused a fourth series, choosing to select its Eurovision Song Contest entry using a multi-artist national final. The show was then offered to Telecinco, who bought its rights. This fourth series started airing in June 2005 and got better ratings than the third one, but it never reached the results that the first series achieved. Runner-up Soraya Arnelas would represent Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 and sixth-placed Edurne would represent Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest 2015.
=== Series 5 (2006–07) ===
Telecinco announced in May 2006 that the fifth series of the program was to be released in October 2006.

In July, 25 Telecinco aired a special show titled &quot;Operación Triunfo 2006: Otra Vez en Marcha&quot;. In this show some former OT artists (among them, Rosa, Soraya Arnelas, Sergio Rivero, Natalia, Beth) performed and the new selection of contestants was introduced.

The fifth series started on Sunday 8 October 2006 with 18 finalists, but two finalists had to leave and they didn&#x27;t enter the academy. It created some controversy as one of the first two people out that night was the first black person, Claritzel, ever to be on the show (she had to pull out of the previous year&#x27;s show). She had to leave the show because of a heart intervention.

=== Series 6 (2008) ===
Castings started in Barcelona for the new series on 18 February 2008. The sixth series began on 8 April 2008, with 18 candidates to enter the academy (two of them didn&#x27;t). This series has been the most controversial because many critics pointed that the series centered more on the reality show aspect than on the contestants&#x27; performing talent. Runner-up Pablo López went on to launch a successful recording career in 2014.
=== Series 7 (2009) ===
The castings were made in March and April 2009 in all Spain. The first gala from OT 2009 was televised on 29 April 2009. Once again, Risto Mejide was a part of the jury panel, along with Noemí Galera, Coco Comín and Ramoncín.

=== Series 8 (2011) ===

This was the last series aired by Telecinco. The show was cancelled after 35 days due to poor ratings. It ended with a rushed finale featuring contestants from previous series. Despite the low ratings, fans of the show made the Twitter hashtag #VivaOT, which went on to be the highest trending topic during the airing of the finale.

=== Series 9 (2017–18) ===
Six years after the show was discontinued and thirteen years after it last aired on TVE, RTVE approved to revive the contest. The total cost of the new series was €10,2million. Casting auditions for the ninth series were held from 14 June 2017 to 18 July 2017 in Barcelona, Las Palmas, Palma, Valencia, Santiago de Compostela, Bilbao, Granada, Seville, and Madrid. The minimum age to compete was raised to 18. On 18 July 2017, Noemí Galera, a member of the jury panel on previous series, was announced as the new &quot;headmaster&quot; of the Academy. On 28 August 2017, it was revealed that the jury panel would consists of singer, songwriter and producer Mónica Naranjo, marketing director Joe Pérez-Orive and music executive and producer Manuel Martos, who would be accompanied every week by a fourth guest juror. On 30 August 2017, Roberto Leal was announced as the new host. The series premiered on 23 October 2017. The final took place on 5 February 2018, and Amaia Romero was announced the winner. In addition, Amaia and Alfred were selected to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with &quot;Tu canción&quot;, and finished in twenty-third place out of 26 countries.

=== Series 10 (2018) ===

On 28 February 2018, RTVE&#x27;s Governing Board approved the renewal of &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; for a tenth series. Casting auditions for the tenth series were held from 30 May 2018 to 10 July 2018 in Barcelona, Alicante, Valencia, Majorca, San Sebastián, Vigo, Tenerife, Málaga, Seville and Madrid. The series premiered on 19 September 2018 and ended on 19 December 2018.

The 18 contestants that appeared on the introduction live show or &quot;Gala 0&quot; were announced on 14 September 2018.

As in the previous season, the series served as the platform to select the Spanish entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. A special live show was held on 20 January 2019 to select the Spanish entrant and song for Eurovision.

=== Series 11 (2020) ===

In January 2019, TVE confirmed an eleventh series. Casting auditions for the eleventh series were held from 7 October 2019 to 6 November 2019 in Barcelona, Las Palmas, Valencia, Palma, Málaga, Seville, Bilbao, Santiago de Compostela and Madrid. The series premiered on 12 January 2020.

=== Series 12 (2023–24) ===

Three years after it last aired in TVE, Amazon Prime Video acquired the rights to air the series. On 27 May 2023, series one contestant Chenoa was announced as the host. Casting auditions were held from 3 July 2023 to 19 September 2023 in Barcelona, Zaragoza, Santiago de Compostela, Bilbao, Valencia, Las Palmas, Málaga, Seville and Madrid. The series premiered on 20 November 2023.

<text>John Noble Lennox Morrison (born 14 July 1943, in Hexham), joined the UK&#x27;s Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) in 1967 as a desk-level intelligence analyst. During his Ministry of Defence (MoD) career he occupied a wide range of analytical and management positions in the DIS and elsewhere, including three tours in the Cabinet Office, culminating as Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).

Morrison ended his official career as the senior civilian intelligence professional in the Defence Intelligence Staff, serving four years as Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence and Head of the Defence Intelligence Analysis Staff. During this period he represented the MoD and DIS as a member of the JIC, UK representative to the NATO Intelligence Board and Head of Profession for MoD Intelligence Analyst classes. He was awarded the US Defence Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Award in 1999.

On leaving the DIS and the civil service in 1999, Morrison was selected by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) to be its first &quot;Investigator&quot;. He held this position until 2004, when his contract was prematurely terminated by the committee after he appeared on the UK BBC television programme &quot;Panorama&quot; and maintaining that Saddam Hussein was not in fact a threat to the UK. Morrison is a joint author of &quot;The Open Side of Secrecy: Britain&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee&quot;, the first in-depth study of the ISC.

Since his retirement, Morrison has appeared on a number of TV and radio programmes, including &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Politics Show&quot;, &quot;Newsnight&quot;, and &quot;Conspiracy Files&quot; (on the death of Dr David Kelly).

<doc id="1149537" wikidata="Q1344373" url="?curid=1149537" title="Kevin Macdonald (director)">
<text>Kevin Macdonald (born 28 October 1967) is a Scottish film director. His films include &quot;One Day in September&quot; (1999), a documentary about the 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes, which won him the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, the climbing documentary &quot;Touching the Void&quot; (2003), the drama &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; (2006), the political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot; (2009), the Bob Marley documentary &quot;Marley&quot; (2012), the post-apocalyptic drama &quot;How I Live Now&quot; (2013), the thriller &quot;Black Sea&quot; (2014), the Whitney Houston documentary &quot;Whitney&quot; (2018), and the legal drama film &quot;The Mauritanian&quot; (2021).

==Personal life==
Macdonald was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His maternal grandparents were the Hungarian-born British Jewish filmmaker Emeric Pressburger and English screenwriter and actress Wendy Orme. He was brought up in Gartocharn, Dunbartonshire and attended the local primary school for the first five years of his education, He was educated at Glenalmond College, and St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. His brother Andrew Macdonald is a film producer.

In 1999, he married Tatiana Lund, with whom he has three sons. He lives in North London.

==Career==
Macdonald began his career with a biography of his grandfather, &quot;The Life and Death of a Screenwriter&quot; (1994), which he turned into the documentary &quot;The Making of an Englishman&quot; (1995).

After making a series of biographical documentaries, Macdonald directed &quot;One Day in September&quot; (1999), about the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Possibly the most striking feature of this film was the lengthy interview with Jamal Al-Gashey, the last known survivor among the Munich terrorists (it has been suggested recently in Aaron Klein&#x27;s book &quot;Striking Back&quot; that another, Mohammed Safady, might also still be alive). Macdonald found Al-Gashey through intermediaries, and was able to convince him that the film would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. Since the former terrorist was convinced that Israeli authorities were still hunting him (he had been in hiding ever since being ransomed for a hijacked aeroplane less than two months after the Munich massacre), Al-Gashey agreed to the interview only on condition that he would be disguised, his face would be shown only in shadow or blurred out, and that the interview would be conducted by a person and in a place of Al-Gashey&#x27;s choosing (which turned out to be Amman, Jordan), although Al-Gashey agreed that Macdonald could be present. Since the interview was conducted entirely in Arabic (even though Al-Gashey was known to be fluent in English, having been interviewed in the language in 1972), and Al-Gashey (through paranoia or annoyance) frequently stormed out of the interview room, Macdonald did not know if he had anything usable until he returned to London and hired an Arabic translator. The film won an Oscar for Best Documentary.

His next film was &quot;Touching the Void&quot;, a docudrama that told the story of two climbers making the first successful ascent of the West Face of Siula Grande, a major peak in the Peruvian Andes, in 1985 and the subsequent dramatic series of events during their descent after one of the climbers broke his leg whilst high on the peak. The film won the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film at the 2003–04 BAFTA Awards – coincidentally, it was Korda who had given Macdonald&#x27;s grandfather his first job when he had arrived in Britain in 1935.

Next was &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot;, for which Forest Whitaker received widespread acclaim and won multiple acting awards including Academy Award for Best Actor.

He has also directed a number of television commercials with RSA Films who represent him for all his TV commercial work worldwide.

Macdonald directed the film adaptation of hit BBC television drama &quot;State of Play&quot;, starring Russell Crowe. He then directed &quot;The Eagle&quot;, an adaptation of the book &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot;, about a Roman Legion in 2nd century A.D. in Scotland. &quot;Bobby Fischer Goes to War&quot;, his next project, is a film about the 1972 World Chess Championship in Reykjavík, Iceland, in which Bobby Fischer took on the entire Soviet chess establishment.

Macdonald made the film &quot;Life in a Day&quot; with producer Ridley Scott. The footage was filmed by thousands of people all around the world about their life in one day and posted on YouTube. The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival to a global live audience, on 27 January 2011.

Macdonald worked with the film production team Altitude, who created the commercially and critically acclaimed Amy Winehouse documentary film &quot;Amy&quot; (2015), on &quot;Whitney&quot;, a 2018 documentary based on Whitney Houston&#x27;s life and death. This was the first Whitney Houston documentary to be officially authorized by the estate, and includes never-before-seen footage of Houston, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances and interviews with luminaries like Clive Davis. Macdonald stated, &quot;The story that is never told about Whitney is just how brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung – bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists don&#x27;t sell.&quot;
In 2021, Macdonald released &quot;The Mauritanian&quot;, a legal drama based on the true story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian man who was held for fourteen years (from 2002 to 2016) without charge in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a United States military prison. The film received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising Macdonald&#x27;s direction, its cinematography and performances of the cast but criticised its screenplay. At the 78th Golden Globe Awards the film received two nominations; Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (for Rahim), with Foster winning Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. At the 74th British Academy Film Awards the film received five nominations, including Best Film.

His 2023 project &quot;George Blake&quot;, produced by Femke Wolting, won the development prize at 2024 Series Mania SERIESMAKERS section.

<doc id="1149539" wikidata="Q5156411" url="?curid=1149539" title="Complement receptor 1">
<text>Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) also known as C3b/C4b receptor or CD35 (cluster of differentiation 35) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CR1&quot; gene.

This gene is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family and is located in the &#x27;cluster RCA&#x27; region of chromosome 1. The gene encodes a monomeric single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein found on erythrocytes, leukocytes, glomerular podocytes, hyalocytes, and splenic follicular dendritic cells. The Knops blood group system is a system of antigens located on this protein. The protein mediates cellular binding to particles and immune complexes that have activated complement. Decreases in expression of this protein and/or mutations in its gene have been associated with gallbladder carcinomas, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with a reduction in &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; rosetting, conferring protection against severe malaria. Alternate allele-specific splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. Additional allele specific isoforms, including a secreted form, have been described but have not been fully characterized.

In primates, CR1 serves as the main system for processing and clearance of complement opsonized immune complexes. It has been shown that CR1 can act as a negative regulator of the complement cascade, mediate immune adherence and phagocytosis and inhibit both the classic and alternative pathways. The number of CR1 molecules decreases with aging of erythrocytes in normal individuals and is also decreased in pathological conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV infection, some haemolytic anaemias and other conditions featuring immune complexes. In mice, CR1 is an alternatively spliced variant of the complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene.

Certain alleles of this gene have been statistically associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In humans, the &quot;CR1&quot; gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at band 32 (1q32) and lies within a complex of immunoregulatory genes. In 5&#x27;-3&#x27; order the genes in this region are: membrane cofactor protein – CR1 – complement receptor type 2 – decay-accelerating factor – C4-binding protein.
* Membrane cofactor protein is a widely distributed C3b/C4b binding regulatory glycoprotein of the complement system;
* decay-accelerating factor (DAF: CD55: Cromer antigen) protects host cells from complement-mediated damage by regulating the activation of C3 convertases on host cell surfaces;
* complement receptor 2 is the C3d receptor.

Factor H, another immunoregulatory protein, also maps to this location.

==Gene structure and isoforms==

The canonical Cr2/CD21 gene of subprimate mammals produces two types of complement receptor (CR1, ca. 200 kDa; CR2, ca. 145 kDa) via alternative mRNA splicing. The murine Cr2 gene contains 25 exons; a common first exon is spliced to exon 2 and to exon 9 in transcripts encoding CR1 and CR2, respectively. A transcript with an open reading frame of 4,224 nucleotides encodes the long isoform, CR1; this is predicted to be a protein of 1,408 amino acids that includes 21 short consensus repeats (SCR) of ca. 60 amino acids each, plus transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Isoform CR2 (1,032 amino acids) is encoded by a shorter transcript (3,096 coding nucleotides) that lacks exons 2–8 encoding SCR1-6. CR1 and CR2 on murine B cells form complexes with a co-accessory activation complex containing CD19, CD81, and the fragilis/Ifitm (murine equivalents of LEU13) proteins.

The complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene of primates produces only the smaller isoform, CR2; primate CR1, which recapitulates many of the structural domains and presumed functions of Cr2-derived CR1 in subprimates, is encoded by a distinct CR1 gene (apparently derived from the gene Crry of subprimates).

Isoforms CR1 and CR2 derived from the Cr2 gene possess the same C-terminal sequence, such that association with and activation through CD19 should be equivalent. CR1 can bind to C4b and C3b complexes, whereas CR2 (murine and human) binds to C3dg-bound complexes. CR1, a surface protein produced primarily by follicular dendritic cells, appears to be critical for generation of appropriately activated B cells of the germinal centre and for mature antibody responses to bacterial infection.

The most common allelic variant of the human CR1 gene (CR1*1) is composed of 38 exons spanning 133kb encoding a protein of 2,039 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 220 kDa. Large insertions and deletions have given rise to four structurally variant genes and some alleles may extend up to 160 kb and 9 additional exons. The transcription start site has been mapped to 111 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG and there is another possible start site 29 bp further upstream. The promoter region lacks a distinct TATA box sequence. The gene is expressed principally on erythrocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and B cells but is also present on some T lymphocytes, mast cells and glomerular podocytes.

== Structure ==
The encoded protein has a 47 amino acid signal peptide, an extracellular domain of 1930 residues, a 25 residue transmembrane domain and a 43 amino acid C terminal cytoplasmic region. The leader sequence and 5&#x27;-untranslated region are contained in one exon. The large extracellular domain of CR1, which has 25 potential N-glycosylation sites, can be divided into 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs) (also known as complement control protein repeats (CCPs) or sushi domains), each having 60 to 70 amino acids. The sequence homology between SCRs ranges between 60 and 99 percent. The transmembrane region is encoded by 2 exons and the cytoplasmic domain and the 3&#x27;-untranslated regions are coded for by two separate exons.

The 30 or so SCRs are further grouped into four longer regions termed long homologous repeats (LHRs) each encoding approximately 45 kDa of protein and designated LHR-A, -B, -C, and -D. The first three have seven SCRs while LHR-D has 9 or more. Each LHR is composed of 8 exons and within an LHR, SCR 1, 5, and 7 are each encoded by a single exon, SCR 2 and 6 are each encoded by 2 exons, and a single exon codes for SCR 3 and 4. The LHR seem to have arisen as a result of unequal crossing over and the event that gave rise to LHR-B seems to have occurred within the fourth exon of either LHR-A or –C. To date the atomic structure have been solved for SCRs 15–16, 16 &amp; 16–17.

==Alleles==
Four known human alleles encode proteins with predicted molecular weights of 190 kDa, 220 kDa, 250 kDa and 280 kDa. Multiple size variants (55–220 kDa) are also found among non-human primates and a partial amino-terminal duplication (CR1-like gene) that encodes the short (55–70 kDa) forms expressed on non human erythrocytes. These short CR1 forms, some of which are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored, are expressed on erythrocytes and the 220-kDa CR1 form is expressed on monocytes. The gene including the repeats is highly conserved in primates possibly because of the ability of the repeats to bind complement. LHR-A binds preferentially to the complement component C4b: LHR-B and LHR-C bind to C3b and also, albeit with a lower affinity, to C4b. Curiously the human CR1 gene appears to have an unusual protein conformation but the significance of this finding is not clear.

The mean number of complement receptor 1 (CR1) molecules on erythrocytes in normal individuals lies within the range of 100–1000 molecules per cell. Two codominant alleles exist – one controlling high and the other low expression. Homozygotes differ by a factor of 10–20: heterozygotes typically have 500–600 copies per erythrocyte. These two alleles appear to have originated before the divergence of the European and African populations.

==Rosetting==
&quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) interacts with uninfected erythrocytes. This &#x27;stickiness&#x27;, known as rosetting, is believed to be a strategy used by the parasite to remain sequestered in the microvasculature to avoid destruction in the spleen and liver. Erythrocyte rosetting causes obstruction of the blood flow in microcapillaries. There is a direct interaction between PfEMP1 and a functional site of complement receptor type 1 on uninfected erythrocytes.

==Role in blood groups==
The Knops antigen was the 25th blood group system recognized and consists of the single antigen York (Yk) a with the following allelic pairs:
* Knops (Kn) a and b
* McCoy (McC) a and b
* Swain-Langley (Sl) 1 and 2

The antigen is known to lie within the CR1 protein repeats and was first described in 1970 in a 37-year-old Caucasian woman. Racial differences exist in the frequency of these antigens: 98.5% and 96.7% of American Caucasians and Africans respectively are positive for McC(a). 36% of a Mali population were Kn(a) and 14% of exhibited the null (or Helgeson) phenotype compared with only 1% in the American population. The frequencies of McC (b) and Sl (2) are higher in Africans compared with Europeans and while the frequency of McC (b) was similar between Africans from the United States or Mali, the Sl (b) phenotype is significantly more common in Mali – 39% and 65% respectively. In Gambia the Sl (2)/McC(b) phenotype appears to have been positively selected – presumably due to malaria. 80% of Papua New Guineans have the Helgeson phenotype and case–control studies suggest this phenotype has a protective effect against severe malaria.

<text>John Morton (1725 – April 1, 1777) was an American farmer, surveyor, and jurist from the Province of Pennsylvania and a Founding Father of the United States. As a delegate to the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, he was a signatory to the Continental Association and Declaration of Independence. Morton provided the swing vote that allowed Pennsylvania to vote in favor of the Declaration. Morton chaired the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation, though he died before signing.

==Early life==

Morton was born in Ridley, in Chester County, present-day Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1725, the exact month is unknown. Morton&#x27;s great-grandfather (, or ) was a Finn with roots in Rautalampi, Finland. In 1653, Marttinen emigrated from the Swedish land of Finland—then a constituent part of the Realm of Sweden—bringing son Martti Jr. to the Swedish colony of New Sweden. The younger Marttinen&#x27;s son Johan anglicized his name to become John Morton Sr., who died in 1724—shortly before the birth of his only son and namesake who would become the famed Finnish American statesman John Morton. His mother, Mary Archer, was also of Finnish descent. When Morton was around seven years old, his mother married John Sketchley, a farmer of English ancestry, who raised Morton.

==Political career==
Morton was elected to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1756. The following year he was also appointed justice of the peace, an office he held until 1764. He served as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. He resigned from the Assembly in 1766 to serve as sheriff of Chester County. He returned to the Assembly in 1769 and was elected speaker in 1775. Meanwhile, his judicial career reached its pinnacle with his appointment as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1774.

Morton was elected to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775. He cautiously helped move Pennsylvania towards independence, though he opposed the radical Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. When in June 1776 Congress began the debate on a resolution of independence, the Pennsylvania delegation was split, with Benjamin Franklin and James Wilson in favor of declaring independence, and John Dickinson and Robert Morris opposed. Morton was uncommitted until July 1, when he sided with Franklin and Wilson. When the final vote was taken on July 2, Dickinson and Morris abstained, allowing the Pennsylvania delegation to support the resolution of independence. Morton signed the Declaration on August 2 with most of the other delegates.

Morton was chairman of the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation, although he died, probably from tuberculosis, before the Articles were ratified. He was the first signer of the Declaration of Independence (and writer of the Articles of Confederation) to die, barely nine months after the Declaration&#x27;s signing on July 4, 1776.

==Legacy==

Morton was the first signer of the Declaration of Independence to die and was buried in Old St. Paul&#x27;s Church Burial Ground (also known as the Old Swedish Burial Ground) in Chester, Pennsylvania. Morton&#x27;s grave remained unmarked until October 1845, when the present-day 11-foot marble obelisk was erected by his descendants.

The inscription on the west side of the memorial reads:

The inscription on the north side of the memorial reads:

John Morton&#x27;s participation in the signing of the Declaration of Independence has been important in terms of the identity of Finnish Americans. In the early decades of the 20th century, Finnish immigrants had to face the question of who were &quot;real Americans&quot;. They claimed to belong, through Delaware and Morton, to the &quot;founding nationalities&quot; of American history. An important role in the dissemination of information was played by amateur historian Reverend Salomon Ilmonen, who researched Delaware and John Morton for Delaware&#x27;s 300th anniversary. Thanks to the Delaware colony and John Morton, American Finns&#x27; self-esteem rose and they celebrated the history of the Delaware colony spectacularly both in 1938 and in 1988.

50 John Morton researchers from around the world arrived in Rautalampi in June 2010 to research Morton&#x27;s family roots. They got to know, among other things, the Delaware monument in the town. According to DNA research, Morton has a 99.56% probability of Finnish descent. His family roots from Savonia have also been confirmed by research. In July 2010, a restaurant Konttiravintola Morton, which was named after him, was opened in Rautalampi.

In 2013 University of Turku established the John Morton Center for North American Studies, after it was concluded that the field of studies regarding North America was fragmented and a national institute was needed.

==Personal life==
Morton married Ann Justis of Chester County, and together they had three sons and five daughters; Aaron, Sketchley, John, Mary, Sarah, Lydia, Ann and Elizabeth. Morton&#x27;s second son, Sketchley, was a major in the Pennsylvania Militia of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Morton was an active member of the Anglican Church in Chester County.

<doc id="1149548" wikidata="Q7968412" url="?curid=1149548" title="War Department Light Railways">
<text>The War Department Light Railways were a system of narrow gauge trench railways run by the British War Department in World War I. Light railways made an important contribution to the Allied war effort in the First World War, and were used for the supply of ammunition and stores, the transport of troops and the evacuation of the wounded.

==Track gauges==

Different track gauges were used in different parts of the world including 600mm, , and .

The military light railways in France were of gauge and used a variety of steam and petrol locomotives from French, British and American builders. The Germans installed their gauge Feldbahn system early in the war. Trench railways of the World War I western front produced the greatest concentration of minimum-gauge railway locomotives observed to date.

==Development==

Britain came to the belated realisation that it needed a flexible and reliable method of supplying the front lines, bringing shells, timber, and fodder from the rear areas and their standard gauge supply points. Narrow gauge light railways were the solution.

Hundreds of locomotives were built by companies such as Hunslet, Kerr Stuart, ALCO, Davenport, Motor Rail and Baldwin to work these lines. Also, Model T Ford conversions were used. Thirty or so Companies were formed within the Royal Engineers to staff the lines. These were mostly British ex-railwaymen pressed into service, though Australian, South African and Canadian gangs served with distinction. An American unit also served under the British flag.

Each area of the front would have its own light rail to bring up materiel. The British perfected roll on roll off train ferries to bring fodder and supplies direct from England via train ferries to France. Northern French rail lines were under direct military control of the Army in the area.

By 1917, the Canadians led the way in showing the utility of light railways. Having built thousands of miles of new frontier track in Western Canada in the previous decades, these &quot;colonials&quot;, led by J. Stewart, supplied the Canadian Corps who went on to victory at Vimy. From this the light railways were expanded to of track, which supplied 7,000 tons of supplies daily. The ebb and flow of war meant that rail lines were built and rebuilt, moved and used elsewhere, but by the latter years of Passchendaele, Amiens and Argonne, light railways came into their own and pulled for the final victory.

==WDLR locomotives==

A large number of locomotives (mostly of gauge) was ordered for the WDLR. These included:

===Steam===
* Hudson 0-6-0WT (built by Hudswell Clarke)
* Barclay 0-6-0WT
* Hunslet 4-6-0T
* Baldwin Class 10-12-D 4-6-0T
* ALCO 2-6-2T

;Dimensions

===Internal combustion===
* Motor Rail (Simplex) , petrol
* Motor Rail (Simplex) , petrol
* British Westinghouse , petrol-electric
* Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. , petrol-electric
* Baguley , petrol-paraffin engine based on a McEwan Pratt design

;Dimensions

===Captured===
A few captured German feldbahn locomotives were also used but these usually had short lives because no spare parts were available for them.

==Other locomotives==

Both the French Army and the U.S. Army had their own locomotives, which included:

===French Army===

* Decauville Progrès type 0-6-0T
* Pechot Bourdon 0-4-4-0T articulated locomotive
* Kerr, Stuart Decauville/Joffre type 0-6-0T+t (based on the Decauville Progrès type)

===U.S. Army===

* Baldwin 2-6-2T

==Preserved locomotives==

===Baldwin===

Probably the most famous of these war service engines were of class 10-12-D, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, U.S. Nearly 500 were built and those that survived the war found new homes around the world. Many went to India and after the war a few went to railways in Britain including:

* Ashover Light Railway
* Glyn Valley Tramway
* Snailbeach District Railways
* Welsh Highland Railway
* Rainham Cement in Kent
Four of this type of locomotive have been repatriated from India and preserved in the UK, two in full working order, and the other two undergoing restoration in 2021.

===Hunslet===
Hunslet 4-6-0 Locomotive no. 1215 of 1916, was repatriated from Australia in 2008 where she had worked since 1924 on the sugar cane railways of Queensland, before ending up at Rowan Bay Bush Children&#x27;s Home in a playground around 1962. She is currently in full working order at the Moseley Railway Trust&#x27;s Apedale Valley Light Railway, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, United Kingdom.

Hunslet 4-6-0 Locomotive no. 1218 of 1916, formerly of Gin Gin Mill, is currently with D.Revell, Weewaa, New South Wales, Australia. This is the locomotive which is now preserved at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia, although she may be in store and not on public display.

Hunslet 4-6-0 Locomotive no. 1229 of 1916, formerly of Cattle Creek Mill, is currently stored at ANGRMS, Woodford QLD, Australia. Awaiting restoration.

Hunslet 4-6-0 Locomotive no. 1239 of 1916, retrieved from a public park in Mackay, restored at the Rail Workshops Museum, currently on display at the Rail Workshops Museum, North Ipswich, Queensland, Australia 

===The Motor Rail &amp; Tramcar Co Ltd,===
Surplus Motor Rail internal combustion locomotives were sold off after the war and provided service for decades in industrial narrow gauge railways systems, such as the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway. The larger (40HP) locomotives came in &#x27;open&#x27;, &#x27;protected&#x27;, and &#x27;armoured&#x27; versions resulting in the curious spectacle of fully armoured locomotives appearing in an industrial context. Many locomotives were overhauled and/or modified by Kent Construction &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd of Ashford which can complicate identifying locomotives (for example &quot;Mary Ann&quot; - the Ffestiniog Loco).

<text>Mario G. Racco (born May 13, 1955) is a politician in Ontario, Canada currently serving as a Local and Regional Councillor in the City of Vaughan since November 15, 2022. He was an Ontario Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2007 who represented the Greater Toronto Area riding of Thornhill.

==Background==
Racco has degrees in Business Administration from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (1977) and York University. He also received a Bachelor of Arts degree from York University in 1981. Racco practiced as a Chartered Accountant, for the firms of &quot;Thorne Riddell&quot; and &quot;Dunwoody Chartered Accountants&quot;. Racco is not a Chartered Accountant nor a Chartered Professional Accountant according to the CPA Ontario member directory.

In 2013, ‘Racco Parkway’ in Thornhill was named after him for his dedication and public service to the city.

He is married to Sandra Yeung Racco, a former city councillor in the city of Vaughan for Ward 4 (formerly held by her husband for 6 terms). They have two children, Alexander and Katrina.

==Politics==
Racco was elected to the city council of Vaughan, Ontario in 1982, and retained this position until his election to the Ontario legislature.

He ran for the federal Liberal nomination in Markham—Whitchurch—Stouffville in 1993, but lost to Jag Bhaduria.

In the 2003 provincial election, Racco defeated Susan Kadis for the Liberal nomination in Thornhill and ran against Tina Molinari, an incumbent from the Progressive Conservatives. Denominational education was a leading issue in this campaign, with Molinari supporting the extension of tax credits for religious education and Racco opposing it; some members of Thornhill&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish community supported Molinari because of this issue. Racco eventually won by 796 votes. On March 6, 2006, he was appointed as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Labour.

Racco was a leading supporter of allowing municipalities to use red light camera technology for safety purposes. In 2004, he was the driving force behind the construction of a new statue of Pierre Trudeau in Vaughan.

During the provincial election of 2007, Racco was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Peter Shurman. In one of the most hotly contested races in the province, Shurman came out with about 1500 votes more than Racco.

In a 2013 by-election and the 2014 Ontario general election, Racco&#x27;s wife, Sandra Yeung Racco ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in Thornhill but was defeated both times by Gila Martow.

Return to Politics

On October 24, 2022, Racco was elected as one of four Local and Regional Councillors in the City of Vaughan.

==Electoral Record==

Four to be elected.

<text>Amorebieta-Etxano, also known as Zornotza (Spanish, &quot;Amorebieta-Echano&quot;), is a town and municipality located in Biscay in the Basque Country, an Autonomous Community in northern Spain.

At the time of the 2019 census, the population of the municipality was 19,339, with 16,907 inhabitants living in Amorebieta. The mayor is Andoni Agirrebeitia.

==Geography==

Amorebieta-Etxano is an inland town in the comarca of Duranguesado in the province of Biscay in northern Spain. It is about east of Bilbao and close to the European route E70 which runs along the north coast of Spain. It is located in the valley of the River Ibaizabal; this river joins the River Nervión a few kilometres to the north, after which it is sometimes called the &quot;Nervión-Ibaizabal&quot; because the two rivers are very similar in size. Amorebieta-Etxano is situated among rugged mountains and has a rich historical heritage.

==History==
The municipality of Amorebieta-Etxano came into being on 26 January 1951 as the result of a merger between Amorebieta and Etxano, two communities in the historic administrative district of Merindad de Zornotza. The other parts of the district were merged into the neighbouring municipality of Muxika. The new coat of arms shows the union between Amorebieta and Etxano. In the 2014 census, Amorebieta had a population of 16,907 while that of Etxano was 221.

==The town==

The town is divided into several districts. The church of Santa María de la Asunción is in the centre of Amorebieta on the banks of the Ibaizaba. It is a large Renaissance building started in 1555 and opened for worship in 1608 and is noted for its altarpiece. Another Renaissance church is the Parroquia de San Juan Bautista de Larrea. This dates back to 1647, and in 1704 it was given to the Carmelite Order to found a convent. In San Antonio is the hermitage of San Miguel de Dudea, and nearby is the Neoclassical López Palace.

A branch of the international company &quot;Tecnalia Research &amp; Innovation&quot; is located here in the &quot;Parque Empresarial Boroa&quot; where the firm employs 1500 people.

<doc id="1149558" wikidata="Q594496" url="?curid=1149558" title="Vickers VC.1 Viking">
<text>The Vickers VC.1 Viking is a British twin-engine short-range airliner derived from the Vickers Wellington bomber and built by Vickers-Armstrongs Limited at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey. After the Second World War, the Viking was an important airliner with British airlines, pending the development of turboprop aircraft like the Viscount. An experimental airframe was fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets and first flown in 1948 as the world&#x27;s first pure jet transport aircraft. Military developments were the Vickers Valetta and the Vickers Varsity.

==Design and development==

The Ministry of Aircraft Production ordered three prototype &quot;Wellington Transport Aircraft&quot; to Air Ministry Specification 17/44 from Vickers-Armstrongs Limited. The specification was for a peacetime requirement for an interim short-medium haul passenger aircraft to serve until the more advanced designs specified by the Brabazon Committee (in particular, the Airspeed Ambassador and Armstrong Whitworth Apollo) could be developed. To speed development the aircraft used the wing and undercarriage design from the Wellington but the fuselage was new. Although the original contract referred to Wellington Transport Aircraft, on completion, the name Viking was chosen.

The first prototype (designated the Type 491 and registered G-AGOK) was built by the Vickers Experimental Department at its wartime Foxwarren dispersal site and was first flown by &#x27;Mutt&#x27; Summers at Wisley Airfield on 22 June 1945. This aircraft crashed on 23 April 1946 due to a double engine failure; no fatalities occurred as a result of the crash. Following successful trials of the three prototypes the Ministry of Aircraft Production ordered 50 aircraft. The first BOAC aircraft flew on 23 March 1946. The prototypes were then used for trials with the Royal Air Force which led to orders for military versions (the Viking C2 (12 ordered as freighter/transports) and the modified Valetta C1).

The initial 19 production aircraft (later designated the Viking 1A) carried 21 passengers, they had metal fuselages and - except for the wing inboard of the nacelles - fabric-clad geodetic wings and tail units. Following feedback from customers, the next 14 examples, known as the Viking 1, featured stressed-metal wings and tail units. The next variant, the Viking 1B, was 28 in (71 cm) longer, carrying 24 passengers with up-rated Bristol Hercules piston engines, achieved a production run of 115. One of this batch was changed during production to so that it could be fitted with two Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engines, with its first flight on 6 April 1948.

On 25 July 1948, on the 39th anniversary of Blériot&#x27;s crossing of the English Channel, the Type 618 Nene-Viking flew Heathrow–Paris (Villacoublay) in the morning carrying letters to Bleriot&#x27;s widow and son (secretary of the FAI), who met it at the airport. The flight of took only 34 minutes. It then flew back to London in the afternoon. It obtained a maximum speed of at and averaged . In 1954 it was bought from the Ministry of Supply and underwent the substantial conversion to Hercules 634 piston engines by Eagle Aviation to join their fleet.

Production finished in 1948, including 16 for the RAF of which four were for the King&#x27;s Flight, but in 1952 BEA adapted some to a 38-passenger layout, taking the maximum payload up from . All Vikings featured a tailwheel undercarriage.

The 58th Viking (c/n 158) became the prototype of the military Valetta, of which 262 were produced for the RAF. When production of this strengthened but externally similar type ended in 1952, a flying classroom version with tricycle undercarriage was already being delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF), called the Varsity. All but one of those entered RAF service, the other example going to the Swedish Air Force. The production of 161 Varsities kept the Hurn works busy until January 1954, and they enjoyed a long service life. Six examples are preserved, including at Brooklands Museum, and the Newark Air Museum.

==Operational history==
The first Viking was flown from Vickers&#x27; flight test airfield at Wisley, Surrey, by chief test pilot Joseph &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers on 22 June 1945 and the third aircraft built was delivered to BOAC at Hurn near Bournemouth on 20 April 1946. Upon the delivery of nine examples to BOAC for development flying, including the two remaining prototypes, British European Airways (BEA) was established on 1 August 1946 to operate airliners within Europe and these first VC.1 Vikings were transferred to the new airline.

After a trial flight from Northolt to Oslo on 20 August 1946 by the newly formed BEA, the first regular Viking scheduled service commenced between Northolt and Copenhagen Airport on 1 September 1946.

In all 163 Vikings were built. The initials &quot;VC&quot; stood for &quot;Vickers Commercial&quot;, echoing the &quot;VC&quot; precedent set by the earlier Vimy Commercial of 1919. Vickers soon ceased to use the &#x27;VC&#x27; letters, instead using type numbers in the 49x and 600 series, which indicated the specific customer airline.
BEA operated their large fleet of Vikings on many European and UK trunk routes for eight years. From 1951, the remaining fleet was modified with 36, instead of 27 seats, and named the &quot;Admiral Class&quot;. BEA operated the Viking until late 1954, when the last was displaced by the more modern and pressurised Airspeed Ambassador and Vickers Viscount.

BEA sold their Vikings to several UK independent airlines for use on their growing scheduled and charter route networks. Some were sold to other European operators. An ex-BEA Viking 1B was fitted out as a VIP aircraft for the Arab Legion Air Force, mainly for the use of the King of Jordan. Most Vikings had been retired from service by the mid-1960s and there are now only six extant worldwide with two surviving examples in the UK, both being under long-term major restoration.

<doc id="1149560" wikidata="Q1032131" url="?curid=1149560" title="Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Reading East was a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. In the 2019–2024 Parliament, it was one of two Labour seats from a total of eight seats in Berkshire.

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. The area was transferred to the new constituencies of Earley and Woodley (Bulmershe and Whitegates, Church, Loddon and South Lake wards) and Reading Central (all other wards). These constituencies were first contested at the 2024 general election.

== Constituency profile ==
The seat contained the University of Reading and most of its students. The Thames Valley Business Park is in another part of the seat, hosting multinational and cutting-edge technology companies in the software and advanced computer science areas. Adjoining the redeveloped heart of town are a handful mid-rise blocks of ex-council flats and serried ranks of former relatively philanthropic biscuit, brick and seeds manufacturing/processing workers&#x27; neat terraces towards the south-centre and east of the town, including firmly Labour-held wards. The suburban north bank of the Thames section takes in Caversham, forming four wards, whilst Earley and Woodley, adding a further three wards, make up strongly-leaning Conservative wards. Intermediate wards such as Redlands and Park are more marginal including Green Party and Liberal Democrat representation.

==History ==
The Reading East parliamentary constituency was first contested in 1983, when it was won by a partial incumbent, Gerry Vaughan, a Conservative who was before that election sitting MP for abolished Reading South. He held the seat through two general elections until he retired before the 1997 election. The constituency was won in 1997 by the Labour Party&#x27;s Jane Griffiths, thus a backbencher under the Blair Ministry. She retained the seat in the 2001 election but was deselected by her Constituency Labour Party before the 2005 election, when the seat was won by the Tory candidate, Rob Wilson, who held the seat through two elections. Until 2005 the seat had been a national bellwether. 

The seat was regained by the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in 2017, Matt Rodda, achieving the party&#x27;s best showing since the seat&#x27;s creation. Rodda&#x27;s 2017 win was one of 30 net gains of the Labour Party. The 2017 result came when there was a hung parliament nationally. Reading East was one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Peterborough, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.

At the 2019 general election, the seat was retained by Rodda with an increased majority, achieving a swing to Labour of 1.9%, and bucking the national trend which saw an overall swing to the Conservatives of 4.6%.

The seat has been, relative to others, a semi-marginal seat, and major-swing (volatile) seat since 2010. Its winner&#x27;s majority has not exceeded 12.9% of the vote since the 15.2% majority won in that year. The seat has changed hands once since 2010.

== Boundaries and boundary changes ==

=== 1983–1997 ===

* The Borough of Reading wards of Abbey, Caversham, Church, Park, Peppard, Redlands, Thames, and Whitley; and
* The District of Wokingham wards of Arborfield, Barkham, Finchampstead, Shinfield, and Swallowfield.

&quot;Formed as a county constituency, largely from parts of the abolished constituency of Reading South. It also incorporated parts of the abolished constituency of Reading North, including Caversham.&quot;

=== 1997–2010 ===

* The Borough of Reading wards of Abbey, Caversham, Church, Katesgrove, Park, Peppard, Redlands, and Thames;and
* The District of Wokingham wards of Bulmershe, Loddon, South Lake, and Whitegates.

&quot;For the 1997 general election, the constituency lost its southern areas comprising the parts of the District of Wokingham to Wokingham (including Shinfield) and Bracknell (Finchampstead), but gained other parts of Wokingham to the east of the Reading. The boundary with Reading West was realigned, gaining Katesgrove ward and losing Whitley ward. It was redesignated as a Borough Constituency.&quot;

===2010–2024===
* The Borough of Reading wards of Abbey, Caversham, Church, Katesgrove, Mapledurham, Park, Peppard, Redlands, and Thames; and
* The District of Wokingham wards of Bulmershe and Whitegates, Loddon, and South Lake.

&quot;Marginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.&quot;

Reading East was bordered by the constituencies of Reading West, Henley, Maidenhead, and Wokingham.

During her time on &quot;SNL&quot;, she portrayed a variety of roles including Debbie Downer. She has since occasionally returned to &quot;SNL&quot; as a guest portraying Senator Amy Klobuchar.

Other television credits include &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (2002–2004), &quot;Frasier&quot; (2004), &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2012) and &quot;Broad City&quot; (2014–2016). She has also played the recurring role of Wanda Jo Oliver on &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; and acted in films such as &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; (2003), &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot; (2009), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012), and Plan B (2021).

In 2022, Dratch made her Broadway stage debut in &quot;&quot; for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play at the 75th Tony Awards. In 2012 she published her autobiographical book &quot;Girl Walks into a Bar...: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle&quot;.

==Early life==
Rachel Dratch was born on February 22, 1966, in Lexington, Massachusetts, the daughter of Elaine Ruth (née Soloway), a transportation director, and Paul Dratch, a radiologist. Both of Dratch&#x27;s parents were Reform Jews. Dratch attended Hebrew school and had a bat mitzvah. She is religiously nonobservant as an adult, and characterizes the faith she was born into as part of her cultural heritage.

Her younger brother, Daniel, is a television producer and writer; his credits include the TV series &quot;Anger Management&quot; and &quot;Monk&quot;. Dratch says she grew up as the &quot;class clown type&quot; attending William Diamond Middle School and Lexington High School in Lexington. She said while performing in high school plays she gravitated towards acting in comedies more often than in dramas.

Dratch attended the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in the fall of 1985 and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1988. She majored in drama and psychology and was a member of the improvisational comedy group &quot;Said and Done&quot;. While at Dartmouth, Dratch was a classmate of Kirsten Gillibrand.

==Career==
Dratch was a member of the mainstage cast of The Second City comedy troupe for four years. She received the Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Actress in a Revue for the two revues in which she performed: &quot;Paradigm Lost&quot; and &quot;Promisekeepers, Losers Weepers&quot;. At Second City, she performed alongside future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; head writers Adam McKay and Tina Fey, as well as future &quot;30 Rock&quot; performer Scott Adsit. The first incarnation of her &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;Wicked&quot; sketch was performed in The Second City&#x27;s &quot;Paradigm Lost&quot;. 

In addition to acting, Dratch also played the cello onstage. The theater also hosted the first incarnation of &quot;Dratch &amp; Fey&quot; (her critically praised two-woman show with Tina Fey), which was later performed at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York, where it was dubbed &quot;the funniest thing to be found on any New York comedy stage&quot; by &quot;Time Out New York&quot;.

Dratch has appeared in several films, including &quot;Martin &amp; Orloff&quot;, &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot;, &quot;Down with Love&quot;, &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;, &quot;Click&quot;, &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;, &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot;, and &quot;My Life in Ruins&quot;. She also has joined fellow &quot;SNL&quot; cast members on &quot;A.S.S.S.S.C.A.T.: Improv&quot;, which aired September 7, 2005, on the Bravo channel.

Dratch also made television appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Third Watch&quot; and in a recurring role on &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (playing Denise, the on-off girlfriend of Patton Oswalt&#x27;s character Spence Olchin, who worked in a bowling alley). Other television appearances include &quot;Portlandia&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, and in season five of &quot;The Middle&quot;. 

She also appeared online with comedian Billy Eichner in a spoof of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys&#x27;s &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot;, titled &quot;Forest Hills State of Mind.&quot;

Dratch was originally cast in the role of Jenna Maroney on &quot;30 Rock&quot; as &quot;Jenna DeCarlo&quot;, and the original pilot episode features her in the role. After feedback from test audiences, the role was ultimately recast with Jane Krakowski. She went on to play a variety of small guest roles in several episodes of the first season, including Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Taylor, cat trainer Greta Johansen, custodian Jadwiga, a blue monster, and Dr. Beauvoir.

On March 19, 2012, Dratch&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Girl Walks into a Bar...: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle&quot; was published. In it, Dratch recounts her experiences after being recast in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; pilot, including the birth of her child.

In 2016 Dratch hosted the program &quot;Rachel Dratch&#x27;s Late Night Snack&quot; on truTV. The sketch comedy program featured Dratch playing a waitress who doesn&#x27;t talk in wraparound segments. Dratch also appeared in sketches and the show ran for two seasons.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Her tenure at &quot;SNL&quot; spanned 1999 to 2006. Dratch&#x27;s recurring characters included Denise McDenna, a Boston teen; Sheldon, the junior-high-school boy from &quot;Wake up, Wakefield&quot;; Virginia Clarvin, one of the Lovers (with Will Ferrell, as two pretentious professors); Abe Scheinwald, a Hollywood producer with a terrible acquisition record; and, perhaps most memorably, Debbie Downer, a depressed woman who brought others&#x27; moods down while saying grim non sequiturs. 

In December 2011, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s season 37 Christmas show, hosted by former cast member Jimmy Fallon. On April 15, 2017, she made another guest appearance with host Jimmy Fallon. On a February 3, 2018 season 43 episode hosted by Natalie Portman, she made a guest appearance as a &quot;Patriot of New England&quot; in a Revolutionary War-themed sketch parodying the fans of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles in advance of Super Bowl LII. 

On a September 29, 2018 season 44 episode hosted by Adam Driver, she appeared as Senator Amy Klobuchar in the opening sketch, about the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. She continued to reprise the role of Klobuchar during sketches on the 2020 Democratic Party Presidential primary debates, specifically the fifth and sixth debates in November and December 2019.

==Personal life==
In her book &quot;Girl Walks Into a Bar...&quot;, Dratch discusses meeting John Wahl, a consultant in the natural foods industry, in a bar in 2009. Six months later, Dratch learned she was pregnant, and on August 24, 2010, Dratch gave birth to Eli Benjamin, her son with Wahl. In an October 2010 interview, Dratch told &quot;People&quot; that her pregnancy at age 44 shocked her because she &quot;had bought into all this stuff about, &#x27;Once you&#x27;re over 40 [pregnancy becomes difficult]&#x27;&quot; and had &quot;gone through the whole process of letting go of [the idea of having kids].&quot; As of 2019, Dratch and Wahl are not a couple, but are on good terms and live near each other to parent their son.

<doc id="1149562" wikidata="Q885835" url="?curid=1149562" title="Richard K. Call">
<text>Richard Keith Call (October 24, 1792 – September 14, 1862) was an American attorney, politician, and enslaver who served as the 3rd and 5th territorial governor of Florida. Before that, he was elected to the Florida Territorial Council and as a delegate to the U.S. Congress from Florida. In the mid-1830s, he developed two plantations in Leon County, Florida, one of which was several thousand acres in size. In 1860, Call enslaved more than 120 people and enslaved the third-most people in the county. Call was also a Southern Unionist opposed to Florida&#x27;s declared secession during the American Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Richard Call was born to William and Helen Meade Walker Call and was the nephew of another Richard Call, a Revolutionary War hero. Call was born in Pittsfield, Prince George County, Virginia. When Call was young, his father, William, and two of his brothers died. Shortly after 1800, his widowed mother brought her four surviving children and five enslaved people across the Appalachian Mountains into Kentucky. She eventually settled on land owned by her brother Senator David Walker in Russellville, Kentucky, where Call spent most of his remaining childhood. Following the death of his mother in 1810, Call settled near another uncle in Tennessee to receive a formal education. In 1813, he left college to take part in the Creek War, which occurred during the period of the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Call was the uncle of Wilkinson Call, who became a U.S. Senator.

==War and politics==
Richard Call came favorably to the attention of General Andrew Jackson, a leader during the war. In 1814, Call was commissioned as a first lieutenant and went to Florida to serve as Jackson&#x27;s aide. He returned with General Jackson in 1821 to establish the territorial government after the United States acquired Florida from Spain by the Adams-Onís Treaty. After resigning from the Army in 1822, Call made Florida his home and opened a legal practice.

Call was a delegate to the 1856 Know Nothing convention in Philadelphia but walked out over the North vs. South split over slavery (demanding that Section 12 in support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act be restored).

==Marriage and family==
In 1824, Call married Mary Letitia Kirkman of Nashville. Her parents were enemies of Jackson and opposed the marriage. The young couple was married at General Jackson&#x27;s home, the Hermitage. Of their several children born, two daughters, Ellen Call Long and Mary Call Brevard, survived to adulthood.

==Florida==
Call spent the rest of his life in Florida. He was appointed receiver in the land office, giving him insight into developing areas. He was elected to the Legislative Council of the territory and served as a Delegate to the U.S. Congress. In the 1830s, he bought and developed two plantations in Leon County. One had nearly 9,000 acres, and the other, The Grove Plantation, was a square mile in northern Tallahassee.

On March 16, 1836, he was appointed by President Andrew Jackson as the territory governor. During his first term as brigadier general of the Florida Militia, he led forces in fighting the Seminole Indians, most notably at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp in the Seminole War. President Martin Van Buren replaced him as governor with Robert R. Reid on December 2, 1839, following a dispute with Federal authorities over their assistance during the war.

In the 1840 presidential campaign, Call crossed party lines to assist Whig William Henry Harrison, who won and appointed him again as governor of Florida. During this second term, which began on March 19, 1841, Call moved the territory closer to statehood. He worked to minimize the financial problems that Florida suffered due to bank failures and a national business depression. He left office on August 11, 1844.

In 1845, Florida became a state, and Call sought election as governor. However, his role in supporting President Harrison&#x27;s election caused him to lose.

==Planter and enslaver==
During the 1830s, he had developed two plantations on land that he purchased in Leon County. Orchard Pond Plantation had more than 8,000 acres and was located north of Tallahassee. The Grove Plantation was located on Tallahassee&#x27;s northern outskirts, where the Governor&#x27;s Mansion was later constructed. By 1860, Call enslaved more than 100 people at Orchard Pond Plantation and was the third-largest slaveholder in the county. He died at The Grove on September 14, 1862.

The Grove Plantation was purchased in 1942 by future Florida governor LeRoy Collins and his wife Mary Call Darby Collins, a great-granddaughter of Richard Call. Collins later was elected for two terms as governor. Today, the Call-Collins Mansion at the Grove is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Collinses sold the house and property to the state for use as a historic house museum.

==Legacy==
Several streets in Florida are named after Richard K. Call. Call Streets are in Tallahassee, Starke, Jacksonville, Hollywood, Orange City and High Springs.

The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor.

<text>Feilding is a town in the Manawatū District of the North Island of New Zealand. It is located on State Highway 54, 20 kilometres north of Palmerston North. The town is the seat of the Manawatū District Council.

Feilding has won the annual New Zealand&#x27;s Most Beautiful Town award 16 times. It is an Edwardian-themed town, with the district plan encouraging buildings in the CBD to be built in that style. The town is currently extending its CBD beautification featuring paving and planter boxes on the footpaths on the main streets in the CBD, including the realignment and beautification of Fergusson Street to the South Street entrance of Manfeild Park.

The town is a service town for the surrounding farming district. The Feilding Saleyards has been a vital part of the wider Manawatū community for over 125 years. As transport systems improved and farming practices changed, the need for small, local saleyards all but disappeared, leaving few major selling complexes in New Zealand. Manawatū is a diverse and fertile farming area with high production, high stock-carrying capacity, and a stable climate. These factors make Feilding Saleyards a popular medium for many farmers. A unique aspect of Feilding Saleyards is their location in the centre of town.

The Manawatū Plains, on which the town is sited, are very fertile land, and as such it is a prosperous agricultural area. Being located on the floodplain of a major river has its problems, however, and in February 2004 the town suffered extensive flooding. In 2009 the Horizons Regional Council commissioned a new flood protection scheme to prevent extensive flooding in the future.

==History==

===European settlement===

The town was named after Colonel William H. A. Feilding, a director of the Emigrants and Colonists Aid Corporation Ltd. who negotiated the purchase of a 100,000 acre (400 km²) block of land from the Wellington provincial government in 1871. The first European settlers arrived from Great Britain on 22 January 1874. 

The Feilding Edwardian Project Inc. was established in September 1993 by local businesses with the aim of revitalising the central business area of Feilding. Many of the commercial buildings were built in the 1900s (Edwardian era) and have been restored and preserved over time. Feilding is home to a number of historic collections, buildings, monuments, and museums, including The Coach House Museum, St Johns Church, Feilding Club, Feilding Hotel, and Feilding &amp; Districts Steam Rail Society.

===Marae===

Feilding has two marae, connected to the iwi of Ngāti Kauwhata: Aorangi Marae and its Maniaihu meeting house; and Kauwhata Marae or Kai Iwi Pā and its Kauwhata meeting house.

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,248,067 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kauwhata Marae and 5 others, creating 69 jobs.

<text>The Hermannsdenkmal (German for &quot;Hermann Memorial&quot;) is a monument located southwest of Detmold in the district of Lippe (North Rhine-Westphalia), in Germany. It stands on the densely forested &quot;&quot;, sometimes also called the &quot;Teutberg&quot; or &quot;Teut&quot;, a hill (elevation 386 m) in the Teutoburger Wald (Teutoburg Forest) range. The monument is located inside the remains of a circular rampart. 

The monument was constructed between 1838 and 1875 to commemorate the Cherusci war chief Arminius (in German, &quot;Hermann&quot;) and his victory over Rome at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. When the statue was built, its location was believed to be near the original battle site, although experts now consider it more likely that the battle took place near Kalkriese, about 100 km to the north-west.

== Background ==

In 9 AD, Arminius, a chieftain of the Cherusci people and an auxiliary cavalry commander, turned against his Roman allies and led an alliance of Germanic tribes to ambush three legions under the leadership of provincial governor Publius Quinctilius Varus. The vast majority of the Roman legions were destroyed. To Rome and its Emperor Augustus the loss was a catastrophe and called the &quot;Varian disaster&quot;. 

This event later came to be seen as a vital turning point in Middle-European history as it may have been instrumental in limiting the advance of the Roman Empire into Germania. In the 1520s, Arminius was equated with the name &quot;Hermann&quot;, perhaps first by Martin Luther.

Germany was among those countries where nationalism became a rising force in the 19th century as opposition to aristocratic rule increased. Equating the nation with all of its people rather than just with its rulers was a revolutionary idea at the time. In Germany, it became entwined with the hopes of many for an end to the disunity that had ruled the Holy Roman Empire at least since the Peace of Westphalia. Nationalists wanted one of the German princes to unite all of Germany under a single rule. In this regard, Arminius came to be seen as a symbol, since he allegedly had &quot;united&quot; the Germanic tribes. Reports by Roman historians on internecine fighting among the tribes were deliberately ignored.

Arminius (or &quot;Hermann&quot;) thus became a subject of popular literature such as Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock&#x27;s three dramas on this topic (1769, 1784 and 1789). However, Heinrich von Kleist likely did most to popularise Arminius in Germany with his &quot;Hermannsschlacht&quot; (1808). At that point, the old Empire had been dissolved, the Kingdom of Prussia had been defeated and partially dismembered by Napoleon and all hopes of a German Great Power emerging in the foreseeable future seemed lost. In this situation, Arminius served as an historical role model (&quot;Father of the German Nation&quot;) for those willing to continue the fight against the Empire of France, which was seen as the latest successor of the Roman Empire as an external enemy (via the Medieval Popes and the early modern Kingdom of France). The Congress of Vienna, which re-ordered Europe after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat, disappointed hopes for a unified Germany as the princes were mostly able to retain their independent powers in the new &quot;Deutscher Bund&quot;.

== History of the monument ==

=== Construction ===


Against this backdrop Ernst von Bandel came to the Teutoburg Forest in 1836 to put into action his life&#x27;s dream of erecting a monument to Arminius. He considered building it near the Externsteine, but eventually settled on the &quot;Grotenburg&quot;, locally also sometimes referred to as &quot;Teutburg&quot; or &quot;Teutoburg&quot;. In 1837, an association called &quot;Verein für das Hermannsdenkmal&quot; was established at Detmold with the goal of funding the project, so Bandel could focus on the work of designing rather than on fundraising. Similar organisations were founded in other parts of Germany and donations started to come in. That same year, Prince Leopold II gave his permission to build the monument, but only for the &quot;Grotenburg&quot; location, thereby settling the issue. He also provided the property rights for the project. The local residents agreed to forfeit their wood pasture rights on the peak. Bandel&#x27;s family moved to Detmold.

In 1838, Bandel changed his original draft idea for the figure of 1834 to take into account that a pedestal would be needed in this location, to make the statue visible from afar. Earthworks began in July 1838, and the foundation stone was laid in October 1838. Bandel then traveled to Italy and met King Ludwig I of Bavaria en route, who promised him financial support but also asked for a design change. Thus the rock that was supposed to cap the temple and serve as the base for the figure was to be replaced by a dome surrounded by a gallery. Bandel included this in his final draft of 1840.

Problems emerged as Bandel&#x27;s designs were subject to criticism and the financial viability of the project came to be questioned. Thus, in 1839, Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Christian Daniel Rauch presented an alternative design. The Prussian king preferred Bandel&#x27;s more martial design. Yet despite an ample flow of donations, financial difficulties continued. An initial celebration on occasion of the finished base vault on 8 September 1841 already gave rise to some fervent anti-French rhetoric. In 1844, the pedestal was completed, but it had overshot cost estimates by 4,000 thaler. This caused a rift between the &quot;Verein&quot; and Bandel, who moved back to Hanover in 1846.

After the German revolution of 1848 failed to create a unified German state, the flow of donations for the monument became a trickle and work ceased. Bandel now used his private wealth to continue the work. By 1860, the design for the statue&#x27;s internal iron frame had been created. A supportive &quot;Verein&quot; was founded in Hanover. From 1862, Bandel worked on the copper plates at a workshop in Hanover. In 1866, Prussia defeated Austria and German nationalism once again was on the rise. It became more associated with authoritarianism than with the liberal ideas of 1848 and also more anti-French. That year, Prussia annexed the Kingdom of Hanover and its king once again took an interest in the project. In 1869, William I of Prussia visited Bandel&#x27;s workshop.

After the German victory over the French in the Franco-Prussian War and the creation of the new German Empire, Bandel&#x27;s Arminius monument perfectly captured the mood of the times and work advanced rapidly. The new Reichstag allocated 10,000 thaler. From August 1871, Bandel once again worked on the site and in 1872 moved there with his wife. In September 1873, the workshop in Hanover was closed and the finishing touch to the monument (the attaching of the Emperor William relief) was applied in July 1875. The monument was inaugurated on 16 August 1875, in the presence of Emperor William I and the crown prince, Frederick William, which made this an event of national importance. Around 20,000 to 30,000 people participated in the festivities.

Although it was &quot;given&quot; to the German people in that ceremony, the &quot;Verein&quot; remained the legal owner of the monument. The &quot;Verein&quot; was dissolved in 1881 and transferred responsibility for it to the government of the Principality of Lippe. After a long legal process, ownership passed to the foundation &quot;Hermannsdenkmal-Stiftung&quot; in 1928, which remains the caretaker today. After 1945, the foundation was linked closely to the &quot;&quot;.

=== Later reception ===

From its inauguration, the monument served as a memorial for the war against and victory over France. At the same time, Prussia and Germany were in the middle of &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, a fight against the power of the Roman Catholic Church, thus Arminius became a convenient symbol of &quot;another victory over Rome&quot;.

In the Empire, the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot; was indeed treated as a national monument, but it remained controversial. At first it was Catholics, but later social democrats, unionists and communists who failed to identify with the monument. Until 1909 no large-scale events took place there, but the location was used for numerous private occasions in memory of the 1870/71 war. In 1881, Detmold was connected to the railway and tourists started to arrive, initially numbering just a few hundred per year, but by 1895 there were 20,500 visitors. In 1909, the 1900th anniversary of Arminius&#x27; battle was celebrated with a multi-day event (14 to 23 August), involving parades, costumes and re-enactments of the battle. Around 30,000 people attended the celebration on 15 August at the &quot;Grotenburg&quot;. Historian Hans Delbrück gave the keynote speech and the newly built Bandel Bench (financed by individual donations) was inaugurated. Missing from the scene was the Kaiser, however. Due to a past argument over the succession in the Principality of Lippe, the current Prince, Leopold IV had asked for the Emperor to be omitted from the list of guests. The day ended with an outdoor staging of a new play by August Weweler, &quot;Hermann der Cherusker&quot;. This started an annual tradition of such theatrical events, known as the &quot;Hünenring-Festspiele&quot; after the setting, the &quot;Kleiner Hünenring&quot;. It was to last until the end of the Empire in 1918.

During World War I the monument became an instrument of military propaganda, which implied that the current war would end with a German victory like the battle fought by Arminius or the war of 1870/71. In 1915, the number of annual visitors exceeded 50,000 for the first time.

In the Weimar Republic the monument became a popular meeting point for associations and societies of the nationalist, monarchist and reactionary right whilst the government kept its distance. The 50th anniversary of the statue&#x27;s inauguration from 1 to 19 August 1925 thus was an event dominated by the political right. On 8/9 August, around 50,000 visitors attended a procession. Another highlight was a long-distance relay race called &quot;Hermannslauf&quot; beginning at 16 different points all over Germany (such as Kulm, the Zugspitze or Flensburg) and in which 120,000 runners participated. The final runners arrived at the &quot;Grotenburg&quot; on 16 August. The keynote speech of the celebration on 9 August was given by the head of the right-wing &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, and other nationalist groups such as the &quot;Jungdeutscher Orden&quot; were also prominent. Tourism flourished in the Weimar years: 1920 96,000 people climbed the monument, by 1925 that number had increased to 120,000.

Adolf Hitler visited the monument in 1926 and after 1930 the Lippe NSDAP used the location for a number of assemblies. After the Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power in 1933, the Detmold government tried to have the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot; declared the official &quot;Wallfahrtstätte der deutschen Nation&quot; (pilgrimage site of the German nation) but was turned down by the Nazi government in Berlin. The Nazi leadership preferred to organise events at locations of its own choosing, with better transport facilities. The monument featured as a symbol in Nazi propaganda material, but as a place for assemblies it was mostly used only by the Hitlerjugend and local branches of the various Nazi organisations. In 1936, the monument had 191,000 visitors. Events in 1935 (the monument&#x27;s 60th anniversary) and 1941 (100 years since the foundation stone was laid) were smaller than the 1909 and 1925 celebrations and focused on glorifying Hitler and glamorizing him as the successor of Arminius.

Post-1945, attempts were made to de-politicise the monument. The 75th anniversary celebrations in 1950 were relatively low key, even though they lasted longer than any previous ones, from 6 July to 20 August. They mostly served to promote the region as a tourist destination. Annual visitor number rose to 400,000 in the 1960s and 1970s, but the focus shifted towards the view and the monument as a purely touristic sight, while the political connotations were pushed into the background. Events in 1975 and 2000 (100th and 125th anniversary) for the first time included critical debate of the 19th-century views of Arminius and the role of the monument in shaping the public&#x27;s reception of the Germanic past.

== Description ==

=== Location ===

The monument stands on the peak of the wooded hill known as &quot;Grotenburg&quot;, 386 m above NHN. The hill is part of the Teutoburg Forest. It is located south of the &quot;Stadtteil&quot; of Detmold. To the southwest lies the Sennelager Training Area. The monument is also a point on the Hermannsweg, a long-distance hiking trail.

=== Overall dimensions and materials ===

The monument rises a total of 53.44 m. The statue accounts for 24.82 m (including the sword). Pedestal and base of the statue make up the difference. The statue was made from around 200 copper plates riveted together and supported by an iron frame. The copper weighs an estimated 11.8 metric tons. The pedestal is made of local sandstone, quarried on the hill nearby.

=== Statue ===

The statue faces west. This reflects the idea that Varus&#x27; troops were coming from this direction. It is also intended to confront France, considered to be the &quot;Erbfeind&quot; (sworn enemy) of Germany in the 19th century. The subject wears clothes deemed historically accurate at the time and has a body shape which the designer considered to be &quot;typically Germanic&quot;. The right arm holds the sword pointing upward. The left is supported by a large shield. The statue&#x27;s left foot rests on a Roman Eagle, the standard of the Roman Legions. Next to it lies a fasces, the symbol of Roman judicial authority.

The figure&#x27;s position is known as &quot;contrapposto&quot;, with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. Arminius is shown wearing trousers, a short skirt reaching to the upper thighs, a tabard held closed by a fibula and boots. On the bearded head with short curly hair sits a winged helm. Bandel knew that Germanic tribes did not use winged helmets but wanted to show the eagle as a heraldic symbol of Germany.

The sword has the following inscription in gold letters:
:&quot;German unity (is) my strength – my strength (is) Germany&#x27;s might.&quot;

On the shield is written &quot;Treufest&quot; (roughly &quot;always faithful&quot;).

=== Pedestal ===

The pedestal is shaped like a monopteros, a Classical round temple. This is surrounded by ten columns, supporting Gothic arches. At the time of construction, the Gothic style (which actually originated in France) was deemed a &quot;true German&quot; style. Inside the pedestal is a spiral staircase of 75 steps leading up to a round platform encircling the dome on which stands the statue.

Three of the niches created by the columns contain inscriptions: 

The first shows a Latin quotation from Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Annals&quot;, describing Arminius as the liberator of Germany (&quot;Germaniae&quot;).

The second refers to the &quot;Befreiungskriege&quot; against Napoleon. It blames the prior defeats in the Napoleonic Wars on the help France received from some German states and celebrates Prussia as the leader and liberator of Germany. It also gives the dates of the Battle of Leipzig, the Treaty of Paris, the Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Issy (i.e. the fall of Paris in 1815).

The third niche contains a relief of Emperor William I, celebrating his victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 and his role as unifier of Germany as the first Emperor of the German Empire. He is explicitly equated with Arminius in the inscription. Underneath, an inscription states that Napoleon III declared war on Prussia in July 1870, which resulted in &quot;utter defeat&quot; for France at the hand of the combined German states and the establishment of the Unification of Germany.

=== Stairway and Bandel Bench ===

These structures were added in 1908/09, based on an overall design by architect Wilhelm Kreis. The stairs lead up from a small landing to the statue from the front. The landing ends at the Bandel Bench, a semi-circular stone bench decorated with carvings of trophies taken from the Romans by the victorious Germans (designed by sculptor Wilhelm Albermann). In its centre sits a copper monument commemorating Bandel, designed by .

== Other nearby structures ==

Near the monument stands the &quot;Bandelhütte&quot;, the historic hut where Bandel lived during the final years of construction (1872–75). Today, it features a small exhibition on the monument. A bit further away is the &quot;Bismarckstein&quot; monument, dedicated to Otto von Bismarck in 1895.

== Grotenburg ==

The hill also features two circular ramparts. One, around 300 m from the monument, is known as the &quot;Kleiner Hünenring&quot;. The other, larger one, surrounds the monument and is known as &quot;Grotenburg&quot; or &quot;Großer Hünenring&quot;.

The latter had a total size of around 11 hectares. It likely was one of a number of similar structures built and used from the 3rd to 1st century BC by local tribes at the northern edges of the German &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot;, apparently inspired by Celtic hilltop settlements further south. The &quot;Grotenburg&quot; walls probably were of a type made up of earth and supported by timber, but not much is known about their construction. Almost nothing of the structure remains visible today, as the terrain has been altered by the building of the monument, the parking area and other touristic infrastructure. No archaeological findings have been made, with the exception of a possible Iron Age (Roman) spear head.

== Hermann Monument in New Ulm ==

A similar Hermann Monument was built in the 1890s in New Ulm, Minnesota, a town settled by German immigrants. 

== Today ==

The statue is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Germany with over 530,000 visitors a year. The statue&#x27;s base may be climbed, affording wide landscape views over the surrounding tree cover.

Since 1972, a new form of the &#x27; starts at the monument every April. A long-distance signed hiking trail known as &quot;Hermannsweg&quot; leads past the monument. Since 2008, the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot; has been a part of the signed tourist road &#x27;.

During thunderstorms the prominence of the statue causes it to be frequently struck by lightning. The Blitzortung network of lightning detectors recorded 234 strikes per year on or near the statue.

The term &quot;Herman the German&quot; is also commonly used by English speakers as an affectionate name for the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot;and also as a jocular term for (male) Germans in general.

<text>The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) is an American labor union, representing non-rural letter carriers employed by the United States Postal Service. It was founded in 1889. The NALC has 2,500 local branches representing letter carriers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam.

==History==
Letter carriers were the first postal workers to form their own union. They had tried to organize a national union at least three times—in 1870 in Washington, D.C., in 1877 in New York City, and in 1880 again in New York City.

Recognizing that these earlier attempts had failed in part due to the expense of regularly convening enough carriers to sustain a national organization, in 1889 the Milwaukee Letter Carriers Association decided to time their call for another national meeting of carriers to coincide with the annual reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic—an organization of Union Army veterans—so that letter carriers who were veterans could take advantage of reduced train fares.

On August 29, 1889, delegates moved quickly, unanimously adopting a resolution to form a National Association of Letter Carriers. On the next day, August 30, 1889, they elected William Wood of Detroit as the first president and appointed an executive board to coordinate all legislative efforts.

NALC had 52 locals, called branches, with 4,600 members in 1890, and 335 branches by 1892.

In the beginning, the union focused on forcing postmasters to honor federal law mandating an eight-hour day for federal employees. In 1893, the NALC won a Supreme Court decision and $3.5 million in back overtime pay.

Local postmasters vigorously opposed the union, even though it did not sponsor strikes.

NALC joined the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1917. In 1946, the small National Federation of Rural Letter Carriers merged in.

In the early 1940s, Mario Biaggi, a future highly decorated policeman and US Congressman, became active in New York&#x27;s Branch 36.

By the mid-1960s, NALC had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.

The history of the National Association of Letter Carriers is documented through archival collections at the Walter P. Reuther Library in Detroit, Michigan.

===1970 Strike===
Letter carrier morale plummeted during the mid-1960s as inflation eroded carriers&#x27; salaries. A growing sense of militancy developed as carriers and their families in big cities neared the poverty level.

In New York City&#x27;s Branch 36, a storm of protest erupted when President Richard Nixon provided only a 4.1 percent pay raise in 1969, a figure the NALC deemed unacceptable. Events escalated as the Christmas mail rush neared and Nixon called NALC President James Rademacher to the White House to forge a compromise that tied a pay raise in 1970 to the concept of an independent postal authority to bargain with postal unions.

The Nixon-Rademacher agreement incensed letter carriers and when a House committee the following March approved a bill reflecting the Nixon-Rademacher compromise, calls for a strike were shouted in New York&#x27;s Branch 36 and other branches.

Despite being barred from participating in a strike, on March 17, 1970, the votes were counted in Branch 36, and a long-threatened strike was approved, 1,555 to 1,055. At 12:01 a.m. on March 18, picket lines created by Branch 36 went up at post offices throughout Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City as letter carriers went on strike. Within two days, more than 200,000 letter carriers and other postal employees across the country had joined the walkout.

Nixon called out 25,000 soldiers to move the mail in New York City. The strike ended after eight days when local NALC leaders assured strikers that an agreement had been reached, even though their word was premature. Round-the-clock negotiations began and on April 2 a satisfactory agreement was reached, which was quickly approved by Congress.

The NALC Office of the President: James H. Rademacher Records contain archival material related to the strike.

==Laying the groundwork for the future==
The militancy that came out of New York&#x27;s Branch 36 during the strike changed forever the nature of the NALC.

In 1971, a nationwide rank-and-file movement led by Vincent Sombrotto of Branch 36 was formed with goals of giving members the right to vote directly for national union officers and ending a proxy system that had prevented non-incumbents from breaking into the union&#x27;s power structure.

Sombrotto was elected national president in 1978, ousting incumbent president J. Joseph Vacca. He moved quickly to enhance the union&#x27;s lobbying power with Congress and the Executive Branch, as well as the NALC&#x27;s stature within the trade union movement.

==Membership and politics==
Like most other unions in the United States, the NALC, and most of its rank and file, is involved politically and has largely supported the Democratic Party, although has been critical of Democrats on occasion, such as President Lyndon B. Johnson when he vetoed a postal pay raise in the mid-1960s. The union has also supported a number of individual Republican candidates.

Prior to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, the United States Postal Service was a federal executive department under the name Post Office Department, and the Postmaster General was member of the Cabinet. The rate of postal pay was set by the Congress by federal law, meaning that the Postal Service and its employees were deeply affected by Congress. The NALC strongly supported the Postal Reorganization Act.

NALC&#x27;s expertise has traditionally been in lobbying rather than in traditional labor-management relations and collective bargaining. Like all federal agencies under the Taft–Hartley Act, the Postal Service is an &quot;open shop,&quot; and no one can be compelled to join the NALC or any other union as a condition of gaining or continuing employment with the government. Other federal laws prohibit letter carriers, like other public employees, from striking. Nonetheless, over 93 percent of all working letter carriers are members of the NALC and the union is now recognized as the collective bargaining agent for all city carriers.

The NALC distinguishes itself from other unions in several ways. For example, membership is completely voluntary; NALC states that its membership includes 277,000 active and retired members, including approximately 180,000 active city delivery letter carriers employed by the U.S. Postal Service, either as full-time letter carriers or part-time carriers known as &quot;city carrier assistants&quot;. NALC also refers to its chapters as &quot;branches&quot; rather than &quot;locals&quot;.

NALC developed its own retirement community for its members in Nalcrest, Florida. It also operates a mutual benefit association which sells life insurance to members and has its own health benefit plan—the NALC Health Benefit Plan—which predates the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, in which letter carriers (as federal employees) also participate.

==Issues==

Over the years, the NALC has worked to negotiate the wages and working conditions of city letter carriers. Some of the negotiated issues are the maximum weight of an item that an employee may be required to lift, the maximum weight that an employee can be required to carry in his or her satchel, safe delivery methods, and the letter carrier uniform.

The NALC is opposed to postal privatization and to any termination of the USPS postal monopoly on first-class mail, as well as to contract delivery service (CDS), the contracting out of postal work to non-USPS independent contractor employees (see Star routes), who have lower wages (and fewer benefits or none at all) than USPS employees.

==Charitable and philanthropic activities==

===Muscular Dystrophy Association===
The union has a close relationship with the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The NALC was the first national sponsor of MDA and letter carriers are among the charity&#x27;s top fund-raisers.

===Letter carriers&#x27; Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive===

Each year on the second Saturday in May, as they deliver the mail, letter carriers collect non-perishable food donations left by the mailboxes on their route from postal customers participating in the NALC Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. It is considered the largest one-day food collection effort in the United States. Participation is strictly voluntary.

The national, coordinated effort by the NALC grew out of discussions in 1991 by a number of leaders at the time, including NALC President Vincent Sombrotto, AFL–CIO Community Services Director Joseph Velasquez and USPS Postmaster General Anthony Frank. A pilot drive was held in 10 cities in October 1991, and it proved so successful that work began immediately on making it a nationwide effort.

Input from food banks and pantries suggested that late spring would be the best time since by then most food banks in the country start running out of donations received during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods.

In 2014, the drive gathered 72.5 million pounds of food, the 11th consecutive year the drive surpassed 70 million pounds. That year&#x27;s results brought the total to more than 1.3 billion pounds since the national drive began in 1992.

The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive has also received two Presidential Certificates of Achievement.

===National Heroes of the Year===
Each fall, the NALC holds a awards ceremony, highlighting acts performed NALC letter carriers and branches above and beyond their duties of carrying the mail.

The 2014 National Heroes of the Year awards ceremony recognized letter several letter carriers—a National Hero; a Humanitarian of the Year; heroes from the eastern, central and western regions of the United States—as well as one branch and one post office—as national heroes of the year.

==Political action==
Working to elect members of Congress who support NALC priorities is a primary objective of the union&#x27;s political affairs operation. The NALC&#x27;s political action fund (or PAC) is called the Committee on Letter Carrier Political Education (abbreviated as COLCPE).

COLCPE&#x27;s stated goal is to help &quot;pro-labor, pro-letter carriers candidates get elected so they can go to Washington to support and protect letter carrier jobs.&quot; Contributing to the PAC is strictly voluntary, as federal law forbids unions from using dues money for political purposes.

In 2016, COLCPE was rebranded as the Letter Carrier Political Fund.

===Hatch Act===
Until 1993, active letter carriers were barred from taking any significant volunteer role for any political campaigns. The primary sentiment behind the law was to protect federal employees from being strong-armed and intimidated into helping their bosses run for reelection.

In 1993, Congress amended the Hatch Act of 1939 to allow federal employees to take an active part in political campaigns for federal offices. While there are still some restrictions on what federal employees (including active letter carriers) can do, there is more latitude for letter carrier political participation in campaigns for president, the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as state and local elected officials.

Retired letter carriers, as well as letter carrier spouses and family members, are not bound by the Hatch Act.

Cole was born in on September 23, 1879, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Charles and Mary Lyon (Ball) Cole. He graduated from Harvard University in 1902, where he was a member of the Owl Club.

Cole was one of the United States&#x27; leading experts on machine guns and had published several articles and a book on the subject — &quot; Field Book for Machine Gunners&quot; (1917). He received a direct commission in the Marine Corps in World War I.

Cole received the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during the Battle of Belleau Wood in which he was mortally wounded on June 10, 1918. On that day, while he was leading an attack on enemy machine guns a German hand grenade wounded him in the foot. When a second grenade landed in front of him, he grabbed it to throw it back and protect his men — it exploded in his hand. He crawled back to his men under rifle fire. He died from his wounds on June 18, 1918, in a field hospital near Coulommiers, France, with his brother, U.S. Army Brigadier General Charles H. Cole at his side. He is buried in the Aisne-Marne Cemetery, Belleau, France.

His decorations included the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross; as well as the French Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Croix de Guerre.

==Citations==
For his actions on June 10, 1918, during the Battle of Belleau Wood, Cole received both the Navy Cross and the Army Distinguished Service Cross.

Cole&#x27;s Navy Cross citation reads:

:In the Bois de Belleau, France, on June 10, 1918, his unusual heroism in leading his company under heavy fire enabled it to fight with exceptional effectiveness. He personally worked fearlessly until he was mortally wounded.

His Distinguished Service Cross citation reads:

:In the Bois de Belleau, on June 10th 1918, displayed extraordinary heroism in organizing positions, rallying his men and disposing of his guns, continuing to expose himself fearlessly until he fell. He suffered the loss of his right hand and received wounds in upper arm and both thighs.”

==Namesake==
The destroyer USS &quot;Cole&quot; (DD-155) was named for him. (The guided missile destroyer USS &quot;Cole&quot; (DDG-67) was named for a different Cole: Darrell S. Cole.)

<doc id="1149587" wikidata="Q6746453" url="?curid=1149587" title="Man or boy test">
<text>The man or boy test was proposed by computer scientist Donald Knuth as a means of evaluating implementations of the ALGOL 60 programming language. The aim of the test was to distinguish compilers that correctly implemented &quot;recursion and non-local references&quot; from those that did not.


==Knuth&#x27;s example==
In ALGOL 60:

begin
 real procedure A(k, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5);
 value k; integer k;
 real x1, x2, x3, x4, x5;
 begin
 real procedure B;
 begin k := k - 1;
 B := A := A(k, B, x1, x2, x3, x4)
 end;
 if k ≤ 0 then A := x4 + x5 else B
 end;
 outreal(1, A(10, 1, -1, -1, 1, 0))
end
This creates a tree of &quot;B&quot; call frames that refer to each other and to the containing &quot;A&quot; call frames, each of which has its own copy of &quot;k&quot; that changes every time the associated &quot;B&quot; is called. Trying to work it through on paper is probably fruitless, but for &quot;k&quot; = 10, the correct answer is −67, despite the fact that in the original article Knuth conjectured it to be −121. Even modern machines quickly run out of stack space for larger values of &quot;k&quot;, which are tabulated below ().

==Explanation==
There are three Algol features used in this program that can be difficult to implement properly in a compiler:
# Nested function definitions: Since &quot;B&quot; is being defined in the local context of &quot;A&quot;, the body of &quot;B&quot; has access to symbols that are local to &quot;A&quot; — most notably &quot;k&quot;, which it modifies, but also &quot;x1&quot;, &quot;x2&quot;, &quot;x3&quot;, &quot;x4&quot;, and &quot;x5&quot;. This is straightforward in the Algol descendant Pascal, but not possible in the other major Algol descendant C (without manually simulating the mechanism by using C&#x27;s address-of operator, passing around pointers to local variables between the functions).
# Function references: The &quot;B&quot; in the recursive call codice_1 is not a call to &quot;B&quot;, but a reference to &quot;B&quot;, which will be called only when &quot;k&quot; is greater than zero. This is straightforward in standard Pascal (ISO 7185), and also in C. Some variants of Pascal (e.g. older versions of Turbo Pascal) do not support procedure references, but when the set of functions that may be referenced is known beforehand (in this program it is only &quot;B&quot;), this can be worked around.
# Constant/function dualism: The &quot;x1&quot; through &quot;x5&quot; parameters of &quot;A&quot; may be numeric constants or references to the function &quot;B&quot; — the codice_2 expression must be prepared to handle both cases as if the formal parameters &quot;x4&quot; and &quot;x5&quot; had been replaced by the corresponding actual parameter (call by name). This is probably more of a problem in statically typed languages than in dynamically typed languages, but the standard workaround is to reinterpret the constants 1, 0, and −1 in the main call to &quot;A&quot; as functions without arguments that return these values.

These things are, however, not what the test is about; they are merely prerequisites for the test to at all be meaningful. What the test is &quot;about&quot; is whether the different references to &quot;B&quot; resolve to the &quot;correct&quot; instance of &quot;B&quot; — one that has access to the same &quot;A&quot;-local symbols as the &quot;B&quot; that created the reference. A &quot;boy&quot; compiler might, for example, instead compile the program so that &quot;B&quot; always accesses the topmost &quot;A&quot; call frame.

<doc id="1149596" wikidata="Q7831057" url="?curid=1149596" title="TPK algorithm">
<text>The TPK algorithm is a simple program introduced by Donald Knuth and Luis Trabb Pardo to illustrate the evolution of computer programming languages. In their 1977 work &quot;The Early Development of Programming Languages&quot;, Trabb Pardo and Knuth introduced a small program that involved arrays, indexing, mathematical functions, subroutines, I/O, conditionals and iteration. They then wrote implementations of the algorithm in several early programming languages to show how such concepts were expressed.

To explain the name &quot;TPK&quot;, the authors referred to Grimm&#x27;s law (which concerns the consonants &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27;, and &#x27;k&#x27;), the sounds in the word &quot;typical&quot;, and their own initials (Trabb Pardo and Knuth). In a talk based on the paper, Knuth said:
==The algorithm==
Knuth describes it as follows:
In pseudocode:

 ask for 11 numbers to be read into a sequence &quot;S&quot;
 reverse sequence &quot;S&quot;
 for each &quot;item&quot; in sequence &quot;S&quot;
 call a function to do an operation
 if &quot;result&quot; overflows
 alert user
 else
 print &quot;result&quot;

The algorithm reads eleven numbers from an input device, stores them in an array, and then processes them in reverse order, applying a user-defined function to each value and reporting either the value of the function or a message to the effect that the value has exceeded some threshold.

== Implementations ==
=== Implementations in the original paper ===
In the original paper, which covered &quot;roughly the first decade&quot; of the development of high-level programming languages (from 1945 up to 1957), they gave the following example implementation &quot;in a dialect of ALGOL 60&quot;, noting that ALGOL 60 was a later development than the languages actually discussed in the paper:
TPK: begin integer i; real y; real array a[0:10];
 real procedure f(t); real t; value t;
 f := sqrt(abs(t)) + 5 × t ↑ 3;
 for i := 0 step 1 until 10 do read(a[i]);
 for i := 10 step -1 until 0 do
 begin y := f(a[i]);
 if y &gt; 400 then write(i, &#x27;TOO LARGE&#x27;)
 else write(i, y);
 end
end TPK.
As many of the early high-level languages could not handle the TPK algorithm exactly, they allow the following modifications:

* If the language supports only integer variables, then assume that all inputs and outputs are integer-valued, and that codice_1 means the largest &quot;integer&quot; not exceeding formula_1.

* If the language does not support alphabetic output, then instead of the string codice_2, output the number 999.

* If the language does not allow &quot;any&quot; input and output, then assume that the 11 input values formula_2 have been supplied by an external process somehow, and the task is to compute the 22 output values formula_3 (with 999 replacing too-large values of formula_4).

* If the language does not allow programmers to define their own functions, then replace codice_3 with an expression equivalent to formula_5.

With these modifications when necessary, the authors implement this algorithm in Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Plankalkül, in Goldstine and von Neumann&#x27;s flow diagrams, in Haskell Curry&#x27;s proposed notation, in Short Code of John Mauchly and others, in the Intermediate Program Language of Arthur Burks, in the notation of Heinz Rutishauser, in the language and compiler by Corrado Böhm in 1951–52, in Autocode of Alick Glennie, in the A-2 system of Grace Hopper, in the Laning and Zierler system, in the earliest proposed Fortran (1954) of John Backus, in the Autocode for Mark 1 by Tony Brooker, in ПП-2 of Andrey Ershov, in BACAIC of Mandalay Grems and R. E. Porter, in Kompiler 2 of A. Kenton Elsworth and others, in ADES of E. K. Blum, the Internal Translator of Alan Perlis, in Fortran of John Backus, in ARITH-MATIC and MATH-MATIC from Grace Hopper&#x27;s lab, in the system of Bauer and Samelson, and (in addenda in 2003 and 2009) PACT I and TRANSCODE. They then describe what kind of arithmetic was available, and provide a subjective rating of these languages on parameters of &quot;implementation&quot;, &quot;readability&quot;, &quot;control structures&quot;, &quot;data structures&quot;, &quot;machine independence&quot; and &quot;impact&quot;, besides mentioning what each was the first to do.

=== Implementations in more recent languages ===
====C implementation====
This shows a C implementation equivalent to the above ALGOL 60.
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

double f(double t)
 return sqrt(fabs(t)) + 5 * pow(t, 3);

int main(void)
 double a[11] = {0}, y;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++)
 scanf(&quot;%lf&quot;, &amp;a[i]);

 for (int i = 10; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
 y = f(a[i]);
 if (y &gt; 400)
 printf(&quot;%d TOO LARGE\n&quot;, i);
 else
 printf(&quot;%d %.16g\n&quot;, i, y);
}
====Python implementation====
This shows a Python implementation.
from math import sqrt
def f(t):
 return sqrt(abs(t)) + 5 * t**3
a = [float(input()) for _ in range(11)]
for i, t in reversed(list(enumerate(a))):
 y = f(t)
 print(i, &quot;TOO LARGE&quot; if y &gt; 400 else y)
====Rust implementation====
This shows a Rust implementation.
use std::{io, iter::zip};

fn f(t: f64) -&gt; Option&lt;f64&gt; {
 let y = t.abs().sqrt() + 5.0 * t.powi(3);
 (y &lt;= 400.0).then_some(y)

fn main() {
 let mut a = [0f64; 11];
 for (t, input) in zip(&amp;mut a, io::stdin().lines()) {
 *t = input.unwrap().parse().unwrap();

 a.iter().enumerate().rev().for_each(|(i, &amp;t)| match f(t) {
 None =&gt; println!(&quot;{i} TOO LARGE&quot;),
 Some(y) =&gt; println!(&quot;{i} {y}&quot;),
}

<doc id="1149598" wikidata="Q666140" url="?curid=1149598" title="David Taylor Model Basin">
<text>The David W. Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) is one of the largest ship model basins—test facilities for the development of ship design—in the world. DTMB is a field activity of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center.

==History==
In 1896, David Watson Taylor designed and supervised construction of the Washington Navy Yard&#x27;s Experimental Model Basin which was at that time the best facility in the world. That facility was a significant design testing capability before, during, and after World War I. Inadequacies in that facility led the navy to look for a new model capability.

The new navy modeling facility—named for David Taylor—was built in 1939 in today&#x27;s community of Carderock just west of Bethesda, Maryland in Montgomery County. The Carderock facility contains multiple test basins (towing tanks for models) designed for a variety of testing capabilities. DTMB has strongly influenced naval architecture for 70 years.

==Technical capabilities==
Three adjoining sections comprise the Shallow Water Basin: deep water, shallow water, and a -shaped turning basin used for steering maneuvers. Its carriage can provide speeds up to 18 knots.

The Deep Water Basin wavemaker located along the side, and a wave absorbing beach at the other. The wavemaker consists of 216 electro-mechanical panels called wave boards. This capability allows modeling of regular or irregular sea states. Located behind a movable section of the beach is a fitting out dry dock. Its carriage can provide speeds up to 20 knots.

The High-Speed Basin comprises two adjoining sections: a deep water section and a shallow water section. Wavemaking capability exists in this basin, and there are three large underwater viewing windows at different elevations which are set into the wall about mid-length. The high-speed carriages can provide complex motions for the model at speeds up to 50 knots.

==Computing==
The David Taylor Model Basin was an early adopter of computers, and an active site for computer technology. Represented by Betty Holberton, it was one of three government agencies present at the 1959 meeting where the computer language COBOL was created.

<text>A shoehorn or shoe horn (sometimes called a shoespooner, shoe spoon, shoe schlipp, or shoe tongue) is a tool with a short handle that flares into a longer spoon-like head meant to be held against the inside back of a snug-fitting shoe so that a person can slide the heel easily along its basin to the inner sole. Shoehorns have the same basic shape but the length or strength of the handle varies. Long-handled shoe horns are necessary for longer boots, while shoe horns with sturdy handles are useful for putting on boots or heavy iron shoes. They are sometimes used by people who, because of less flexible joints, wish to reduce straining or bending.

Originally, shoehorns were made from animal horns, hooves, or glass; luxury shoehorns were made of ivory, shell, silver, or bone. Nowadays, however, although shoehorns made of bulls’ hooves are still available, metal, plastic, and wood are most often used.

One of the modern features nowadays in &quot;higher society&quot; is also personalization of these articles. As well as with boot jack or shoes there is a high demand and popularity with having own initials (many times used as a gift) imprinted or embossed there.

==History==
Shoehorns appear to have originated in the late Middle Ages or Renaissance; in English a &quot;schoying horne&quot; is mentioned in the 15th century, though the French word &quot;chausse-pied&quot; is only found during the last half of the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England bought 18 shoe horns from her shoemaker Garrett Johnson between 1563 and 1566, then in 1567 ordered four more in steel from the blacksmiths Gilbert Polson and Richard Jeffrey, and then needed no more until 1586. Presumably these were used by many people in her household, even up to including her private chef Noah Holladay as a Christmas present.

A group of more than 20 known English shoe horns are all signed and dated, to between 1593 and 1613, and made by Robert Mindum. All also are inscribed with the names of their owners; These include both men and women, including &quot;JANE HIS WIFE&quot; in 1612. The inscription on one is typical: &quot;THIS IS AMBRES BVCKELLS SHOING HORNE MADE BY ROBART MINDVM ANNO DOMINI 1598&quot;. There is also other engraved decoration on all, including heraldic medallions, geometric designs and flowers, covering most of the surfaces, in a style characteristic of later scrimshaw. Their shape is very similar to modern examples, and the longest is 11 inches long; five are turned back at the narrow end in a kind of hook. Several have holes pierced in them, presumably for a cord or leather thong used for pulling them out of the shoe or hanging them up. One owner (&quot;Hamlet Radesdale&quot;, 1593) is described as a citizen of London who is a cooper; none of the owners seem to be recorded otherwise. Joan Evans suggested, given the nature of the inscriptions, that Robert Mindum made them as a hobby and gave them to his friends. A powder horn similarly inscribed and decorated by him also survives. The British Museum also has a similar inscribed and decorated horn by another maker.

==Collection==
Currently Martien Tuithof of the Netherlands holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of shoehorns.

== Turn of phrase ==

&quot;Shoehorning&quot; has come to mean, mostly in American English, the act of coercing or pressuring an individual into a situation which does not leave enough room, either literally or figuratively. Shoehorning in a conversational context means to force someone to take one of a limited number of positions, neither of which may adequately express what the individual wants to say (a &quot;For me or against me&quot;-scenario). Shoehorning in a more literal sense can express itself as pushing a number of individuals into an overfilled enclosure of space, such as a theater or a bus (&quot;the usher shoehorned us into the back of the crowded theater&quot;).

Shoehorning can also refer to an unnatural-seeming inclusion of something for reasons which may range anywhere from demographic-pleasing or political correctness (for example, a token character in a television show or film). In this context, shoehorning can also refer to including or forcing characters into a plot who have little to no reason to be there except for appeal or marquee value.

It can also refer to fitting something where it does not easily fit. The shortened expression &quot;honking&quot; (as in &quot;honking around town&quot;) derives from this term, referring to inserting one&#x27;s self into a place or situation where one does not easily fit or is not welcome.

<text>George Henry Ellis (26 October 1875 – 3 July 1898) was a sailor in the United States Navy during the Spanish–American War. He was the only US sailor killed in action during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.

== Early life and career ==
Ellis was born in Peoria, Illinois. At an early age he and his mother moved to New York City, and later to Brooklyn, New York. He enlisted in the Navy on 26 February 1892 as apprentice, third class. On 25 October 1896 he was honorably discharged with a rate of apprentice, first class. Ellis re-enlisted on 3 May 1897 as a seaman, and was later assigned to the as a Yeoman 1st Class. He was transferred to the armored cruiser , and was promoted to Chief Yeoman on 1 February 1898. Aboard the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, Ellis served as Captain Francis Cook&#x27;s clerk.

== Battle of Santiago de Cuba ==

Ellis was killed 3 July 1898 while serving on the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. That day Ellis reported to his battle station on the forecastle to operate the stadimeter, a range-finding device for the naval guns. Chief Yeoman Ellis was considered an expert with the device. Ellis&#x27; target ranges were relayed by messenger to the gun crews. It was reported later that Ellis would stand on the &quot;foc&#x27;s&#x27;le&quot; with a watch in one hand and the stadimeter in the other. He was completely exposed to enemy shell fire, as the observer&#x27;s position was unprotected. As the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was Commodore Winfield Scott Schley&#x27;s flagship of his &quot;Flying Squadron&quot;, it came under heavy fire from Spanish ships during the battle. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was struck twenty times.
As the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was pursuing the &quot;Vizcaya&quot; and &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, Ellis was monitoring the distance between the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and the fleeing Spanish ships, and returning to Schley in person to report the distance. Schley thought the Spanish ships were gaining, so he ordered Ellis to take another range. As Ellis returned once again to the forward turret to find the range, a shell hit him in the face and decapitated him. Schley was standing about 8–10 feet (2–3 m) behind Ellis. Blood was spraying everywhere. Following standard procedure, Ensign McCauley and Doctor Du Valin were preparing to toss the body overboard, when Commodore Schley shouted &quot;No! Do not throw that body overboard!&quot; Ellis&#x27; body was covered with a blanket and placed behind the turret. After the battle, Ellis was laid to rest at Camp McCalla, beside the marines who had fallen at the Battle of Guantánamo Bay. Chief Yeoman George Ellis was the only KIA (Killed In Action) of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.
During October, a memorial service was held at Washington Avenue Baptist Church in Brooklyn. The church was filled to capacity with 2,000 mourners, and thousands more were turned away. Speakers at the service included Commodore Jack Philip of the , Captain Cook of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, New York Lieutenant Governor Timothy Woodruff, and former mayor Charles Schieren. A telegram of condolence from Secretary of the Navy John Long was read.

Soon after the battle, the officers and men of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; started a collection to benefit Ellis&#x27;s widow, Sadie, and their seven-month old infant. By September 1898, $2000 had been raised. In January 1899, Sadie began receiving a pension from the US government.

Ellis was later re-buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York, on 28 November 1898.

== Legacy ==

George Ellis was a prominent character in a fictional account of the battle published in 1899, &quot;Fighting in Cuban waters, or under Schley on the Brooklyn&quot; by Edward Stratemeyer and A. B.Shute.

In 1908, the death of Ellis and the destruction of his stadimeter were cited in an article in the United States Naval Institute Proceedings. The article addressed the impracticality of using observers aloft or in an exposed position on deck to determine range to targets during an actual battle. The proposed improvement was to install the range-finder in an armored installation on each gun turret.

The destroyer USS &quot;Ellis&quot; (DD-154) was named in his honor. Launched on 30 November 1918 and commissioned on 7 June 1919, &quot;Ellis&quot;&#x27; maiden voyage was to the Black Sea. She transported US Food Administration officials for famine relief work. During 1920, she participated in exercises along the US East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea. In January 1920, she was anchored in Guantánamo Bay, about 10 miles (16 km) from the locale of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.

<text>An open shop is a place of employment at which one is not required to join or financially support a union (closed shop) as a condition of hiring or continued employment.

==Open shop vs closed shop==
The major difference between an open and closed shop is the requirement for union membership. There are a variety of opinions regarding the benefits and negatives of open shops.

===Pros vs. cons of open shops===

In the United States, the introduction of &#x27;right to work&#x27; laws has been linked with lower overall benefits but higher economic growth by some proponents. Such conclusions are debatable, however, as employment, investment, and income in traditionally unionized sectors of the economy cannot be correlated to the passage of such laws.

===Union arguments===
&quot;Open shop&quot; means a factory, office, or other business establishment in which a union, chosen by a majority of the employees, acts as representative of all the employees in making agreements with the employer, but union membership is not a condition of being hired.

Unions have argued against the open shop adopted by United States employers in the first decade of the twentieth century, seeing it as an attempt to drive unions out of industries. For example, construction craft unions have always relied on controlling the supply of labor in particular trades and geographical areas as a means of maintaining union standards and establishing collective bargaining relations with the employers in that field.

In order to do that, unions argued, construction unions—and to a lesser extent unions representing musicians, longshore workers, restaurant employees, and others who work on a transitory and relatively brief basis—must require that employers hire only their members.

The open shop was also a key component of the American Plan introduced in the 1920s. In that era the open shop was directed not only at construction unions but also unions in mass production industries. Unions again felt that these proposed policies would give employers the opportunity to discriminate against union members in employment and would also lead to a steadfast opposition to collective bargaining of any sort

== Legal status ==
United States labor law outlaws the open shop in its extreme form: it prohibits private sector employers from refusing to hire employees because they are union members just as it prevents discrimination against employees who do not wish to join unions.

The open shop in its milder form, in which the open shop represents only an employer&#x27;s refusal to favor union members for employment, is legal. Although the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter into pre-hire agreements, in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union, employers are under no legal compulsion to enter into such agreements.

Non-union construction employers have also adopted the phrase &quot;merit shop&quot; to describe their operations. In many connotations, the terms are interchangeable. However, may be used differently by different sides of the open shop issue.

The open shop is also the legal norm in those states that have adopted right-to-work laws. In those cases, employers are barred from enforcing union security arrangements and may not fire an employee for failure to pay union dues.

===Canada===
The term open shop is also used similarly in Canada, mostly in reference to construction contractors that have at least a partially non-union workforce. Canadians enjoy the freedom to associate, guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, inherently including the right not to associate.

In various Canadian provinces, certain &#x27;open shop&#x27; organizations have formed. Many of these organizations claim that small contractors are not adequately protected by current labour legislation.

As labour law is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada, the laws vary from province to province. However, there is some common ground. Despite opposition from open shop contractors, in Ontario, the Liberal government recently reinstituted the card-based certification system that was in place for most of the post-World War II period. Card-based certification was reinstated only for the construction industry. It allows workers to certify an exclusive bargaining agent on the basis of membership, sometimes known as &quot;majority sign-up&quot;. Some observers claim that this system creates a risk of employees being misled by business agents. Others assert that it overcomes the natural advantage that employers in opposition to unionization have over their employees.

Some of these associations permit construction contractors that are unionized to join. Several companies whose employees are represented by the Christian Labour Association of Canada or CLAC, a union with non-traditional rules of membership, are members of the association. CLAC&#x27;s roots trace to the Christian labour movement in the Netherlands.

== Janus v. AFSCME ==

&quot;Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31&quot;, US (2018) is a US labor law case, concerning whether governments violate the First Amendment when they require their employees to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment.

In February 2015, Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner filed suit, claiming that fair-share agreements are unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.

In March 2015, three government workers from Illinois represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case. In May 2015, Rauner was dropped from the case, after a federal judge ruled that the governor did not have standing to bring such a suit, but the case proceeded under a new name, &quot;Janus v. AFSCME.&quot; The case is named after Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees. This became permissible after a 1977 decision by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Abood v. Detroit Board of Education&quot;. The outcome of the case was in favor of Janus and as such non-union members cannot be compelled to pay fees in accordance with a given fair-share agreement that is in place with respect to a union.

<text>Wen Zhengming (28 November 1470 – 28 March 1559), born Wen Bi, was a Chinese painter, calligrapher, and poet during the Ming dynasty. He was regarded as one of the Four Masters of Ming painting.

==Biography==
Wen Zhengming was born Wen Bi near present-day Suzhou on 28 November 1470. He would later be known by his courtesy name, Zhengming. He had an elder brother, Wen Gui, who was born in 1469. When Zhengming was two years old, his father, Wen Lin, passed the imperial examination with the highest possible rank, &quot;jinshi&quot;. Wen Lin was assigned a government position as a magistrate in Yongjia County in Zhejiang province, and left for his job, leaving his two sons in the care of his wife, Qi Shenning. In 1476, Qi died of an illness at the age of 32. Wen Lin commissioned the noted scholar Li Dongyang to write an inscription for her tomb.

Wen Zhengming&#x27;s family was originally from a line of military men who lived in Hengshan County, Hunan province. At the time of his great-great-grandfather Wen Dingcong, the family moved to the city of Changzhou in the Suzhou area. Zhengming was a distant relative of the Song dynasty official Wen Tianxiang, through an ancestor who lived in Hengshan. From this he derived his &quot;hao&quot; (art name), Hengshan, which he used to sign many of his works. His father Wen Lin and his grandfather Wen Hong (Gongda) were both interested in painting. Wen Lin was also a patron of Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming&#x27;s contemporary and fellow member of the &quot;Four Masters of the Ming dynasty&quot;.

In 1489, Wen Zhengming began studying under Shen Zhou, the eldest of the Four Masters and founder of the Wu school of painting, of which Wen himself later became a leading figure. Zhengming&#x27;s father Wen Lin died in 1499, while working as prefect of Wenzhou. At Zhengming&#x27;s request, Shen Zhou provided a written account of Wen Lin&#x27;s life for the funeral.

Wen Zhengming married the daughter of a high-ranking official and &quot;jinshi&quot; named Wu Yu around the year 1490. Her uncle was the artist Xia Chang, whose paintings of bamboo may have influenced Wen&#x27;s own work. Little is known about Wen&#x27;s wife herself, whose personal name was not recorded. After she died in 1542, Wen painted &quot;Wintry Trees after Li Cheng&quot; for a guest who arrived with a gift to mourn her death.

Around 1509–1513, Wang Xianchen, a friend of the Wen family, began construction on the Humble Administrator&#x27;s Garden, generally considered one of China&#x27;s greatest classical gardens. The garden is the subject of some of Wen Zhengming&#x27;s poems and paintings, including an album of thirty-one views painted in 1535 and a second of eight views in 1551.

Wen Zhengming&#x27;s brother Wen Gui died in 1536. Zhengming&#x27;s eldest son, Wen Peng, was a noted seal-engraver. His second son. Wen Jia, was also an artist, as was his nephew Wen Boren (son of Wen Gui). His great-grandson, Wen Zhenheng, a noted garden designer, rebuilt the Garden of Cultivation in Suzhou. His great-granddaughter, Wen Shu, was a popular and respected professional painter of flowers and insects.

==Style==
Wen Zhengming was one of a number of Ming dynasty literati artists who set themselves in opposition to the professional, academy-influenced style favored in the region of Zhejiang. Wen and other amateur artists of the Wu school (named after the region around Suzhou, where many of them were based) carried on the &quot;wenren&quot; () scholar-artist tradition of the preceding dynasties. Eschewing official sponsorship and hostile to the politics of the imperial court, these artists sought private patrons and the respect of their peers, frequently painting works in the style of older masters. Wen studied under the founder of the Wu school, Shen Zhou, whose style he was deeply influenced by. He sometimes added his own poetry to Shen Zhou&#x27;s paintings, thereby benefitting from the latter&#x27;s established reputation. After he achieved fame in his own right, Wen&#x27;s many colophons to Shen Zhou&#x27;s works often lent them authenticity in the eyes of collectors.

Wen and his mentor both revered the artists of the preceding Song and Yuan dynasties, though he rarely imitated them directly. He produced works in a number of styles, and has been called a &quot;chameleon&quot; whose works could easily be misidentified. Wen&#x27;s paintings were highly sought after by wealthy collectors throughout the 16th century, and counterfeits of his works were common during the late Ming.

Wen Zhengming was also a prolific and well-known writer, whose poems often touched on the subject of painting. He regarded art and nature as being inseparable, and frequently wrote about and painted nature scenes, as well as private gardens such as the Humble Administrator&#x27;s Garden.

In addition to his poetry and painting, Wen Zhengming was also known for his calligraphy. As a young man, Zhengming was introduced by his father Wen Lin to a leading calligrapher of the Suzhou area. By 1541, he was thought to be the greatest calligrapher in China, particularly in the &quot;kaishu&quot; (regular script) and &quot;xingshu&quot; (semi-cursive script) styles. As a calligrapher, his technique was influenced by that of the Song dynasty master Huang Tingjian.

<text>Cynthia Lennon (&#x27;Powell; 10 September 1939 – 1 April 2015) was a British artist and author, and the first wife of John Lennon.

Born in Blackpool and raised in Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, Powell attended the Liverpool College of Art, where Lennon was also a student. Powell and Lennon started a relationship after meeting in a calligraphy class. When Lennon was performing in Hamburg with the Beatles, Powell rented his bedroom at 251 Menlove Avenue in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton from his aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith. After Powell became pregnant with their son Julian, the couple married in August 1962, and they lived at Kenwood in Weybridge from 1964 to 1968, where she kept house and participated with Lennon in a London-based social life. In 1968, Lennon left Powell for Japanese artist Yoko Ono; the couple&#x27;s divorce was granted in November 1968 on the grounds of adultery.

Powell had three further marriages. She published a book of memoirs, &quot;A Twist of Lennon&quot;, in 1978, and a more intimate biography, &quot;John&quot;, in 2005. Over the years, Powell held several auctions of memorabilia associated with her life with Lennon. In her later years, Powell lived in Palma Nova, Mallorca, where she died in 2015.

==Early years==
Cynthia Powell was born in Blackpool on 10 September 1939, the youngest of three children of General Electric Company employee Charles Powell and his wife Lillian (née Roby), who already had two sons named Charles and Anthony. Her parents were from Liverpool, but her mother (along with other pregnant women) was sent to the safer area of Blackpool after World War II had been declared and lived in a small room in a bed-and-breakfast on the Blackpool seafront. After the birth, with Liverpool becoming a frequent target of German air raids, the Powell family moved to a two-bedroomed semi-detached house in Hoylake, a middle-class area on the Wirral Peninsula which was considered &quot;posh&quot; by those in Liverpool. At age 11, Powell won an art prize in a competition organised by the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;. A year later, she was accepted into Liverpool&#x27;s Junior Art School, which was also attended by Bill Harry, later the editor of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; newspaper.

==Art college==
When Powell was 16, her father died following a lengthy bout with lung cancer. Before dying, he told Powell that she had to get a job to support her mother and would not be able to go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, Powell rented out a room to four apprentice electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did John Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so Lennon constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered that he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. Powell had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles from her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Jeff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: &quot;Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it&#x27;s Cynthia.&quot;

Powell once overheard Lennon give a compliment to a girl with blonde hair in the college, who looked similar to the French actress Brigitte Bardot. The next Saturday, Powell turned up at the college with her hair several shades blonder. Lennon noticed straight away, exclaiming, &quot;Get you, Miss Hoylake!&quot; (Lennon&#x27;s nickname for her, along with &quot;Miss Powell&quot; or &quot;Miss Prim&quot;). Dressed like a Teddy Boy, Lennon sometimes brought a guitar with him into class, and once sang &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; directly to Powell.

===Relationship with John Lennon===
After a college party to celebrate the end of term, Lennon asked Powell if she wanted to &quot;go out&quot; with him. Powell quickly replied that she was engaged to a young man in Hoylake even though the engagement had ended; Lennon replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t ask you to fucking marry me, did I?&quot; He later approached her and asked if she would go to the Cracke pub. Powell was confused when Lennon ignored her all evening, but eventually invited her into the group with a joke.

They began dating, with Lennon now referring to her as &quot;Cyn&quot;. In the autumn of 1958, Powell ended her engagement to be with Lennon, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. Lennon&#x27;s jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when he slapped her across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with his friend Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, Powell broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology.

Powell&#x27;s work at art school began to suffer, and teachers told her the relationship with Lennon was doing her no good. Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards Powell, later saying, &quot;I was in sort of a blind rage for two years. I was either drunk or fighting. It had been the same with other girl friends I&#x27;d had. There was something the matter with me.&quot; Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon&#x27;s since his youth—later said: &quot;Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [Lennon] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential. He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side.&quot;

The Beatles&#x27; first Hamburg residency took place in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon&#x27;s aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for spending a lot of money on a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as &quot;a gangster&#x27;s moll&quot;, and was often unpleasant towards Powell. The Beatles went to Hamburg for a second time in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe&#x27;s girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother&#x27;s house.

After the trip to Hamburg, Powell&#x27;s mother Lillian said Powell&#x27;s cousin and her husband were emigrating to Canada with their newborn baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon&#x27;s bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. After her student grant had run out, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool in order to pay the rent. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in 2025) from his aunt Elizabeth Sutherland (whom he called &quot;Mater&quot;) who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams.

When Lennon went to Hamburg again in April 1962, Powell found a bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. In August 1962, shortly after having failed her art teacher&#x27;s diploma exam, Powell learned that she was pregnant by Lennon. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and did not think about it at the time. When she told Lennon he said, &quot;There&#x27;s only one thing for it Cyn, we&#x27;ll have to get married.&quot;

==Marriage to Lennon and birth of Julian==
Powell and Lennon were married on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because as soon as the ceremony began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a pneumatic drill that drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers, the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein&#x27;s invitation, in Reece&#x27;s restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the place Lennon&#x27;s parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell was 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night. They travelled to the Hotel George V in Paris for a belated honeymoon on 16 September but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.

During Powell&#x27;s pregnancy, Epstein offered her and Lennon the use of his flat at 36 Falkner Street, Liverpool, and later paid for a private hospital room when the pregnancy was coming to term. Although still unknown outside Liverpool, by now the Beatles had a fanatical following among girls within the city. Epstein had one condition which the Lennons had to follow: the marriage and the baby were to be kept a close secret, so as not to upset any of these fans. One time when news of the wedding leaked out, the group denied it.

The Lennons&#x27; son, Julian, was born at 7:45 a.m. on 8 April 1963, in Sefton General Hospital. Lennon, being on tour at the time, did not see his son until three days later, and when he finally arrived at the hospital, said: &quot;He&#x27;s bloody marvellous, Cyn! ... Who&#x27;s gonna be a famous rocker like his Dad then?&quot; Lennon then explained that he would be going on a four-day holiday to Barcelona, with Epstein. Lennon later referred to Julian as a &quot;Saturday night special; the way that most people get here&quot;, or said that his son &quot;came out of a whisky bottle,&quot; suggesting this as explanation for his poor parenting of Julian as compared to his second son, Sean Lennon: &quot;Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don&#x27;t love Julian any less as a child.&quot;

==Beatlemania==
Around the time of Julian&#x27;s birth, the Beatles became a pop sensation across Britain, a phenomenon which became known as Beatlemania. That one of the members was married and had a son was not publicly known at the time; a 1963 &quot;Lifelines of the Beatles&quot; page in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; detailed over 25 biographical facts about each member of the group, but never gave any hint Lennon was married, even reporting &quot;girls&quot; as one of his hobbies.

The press heard rumours about Lennon&#x27;s wife and child at the end of 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother&#x27;s house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and neighbours protected their anonymity, but Powell was often approached by journalists. In November, she had Julian christened at Hoylake Parish Church, but did not tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because Powell feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and Lennon was angry as he had not wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian&#x27;s godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon&#x27;s secret wife and son.

Brian Epstein told the other Beatles to make the best of the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. After living at Lennon&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s house for some months, the couple moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor&#x27;s Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles&#x27; fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping out in the hallway and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.

Powell accompanied Lennon to the United States in the first Beatles&#x27; tour there, with Lennon allowing the press to photograph them together, which infuriated Epstein, as he had wanted to keep their marriage a secret. On the tour, she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly ushered into a car, and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was. Lennon&#x27;s response was, &quot;Don&#x27;t be so bloody slow next time—they could have killed you.&quot; It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them. At the Emperor&#x27;s Gate address the situation grew worse, with fans sticking chewing gum in the lock of the flat and tearing at any article of clothing when she or Lennon were leaving or arriving. American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John; the women in the lives of the other Beatles received equivalent missives. As late as 1967, Beatles&#x27; wives were still dealing with occasional physical danger from female Beatles fans, with Cynthia being kicked in the legs by one who demanded she &quot;leave John alone!&quot;

As Lennon was either touring or recording, supposed family holidays in 1966 were spent skiing in St. Moritz, with producer George Martin and his girlfriend, or staying at a castle in Ireland, with George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd. Even these were subject to being discovered by fans, and Cynthia and Boyd had to escape the Irish location dressed as maids. As a result of the long recording sessions and tours, Lennon usually slept for days afterwards. When Lennon started filming &quot;How I Won the War&quot; in Almeria, Spain, he promised his wife and son they could join him there after two weeks of filming. The small apartment they were allocated was swiftly replaced by a villa when Ringo Starr and his wife joined them.

==Kenwood==
===Domestic life===
The Beatles&#x27; accountant told Epstein the group members should move to houses near his in Esher, so Lennon bought a house called Kenwood in July 1964. It was a mock-Tudor-style house on three acres in Weybridge, where Cliff Richard already lived.
Lennon then spent twice the original £20,000 purchase price (equivalent to £ in 2025) on renovations for Kenwood, reducing its 22 rooms to 17. The new kitchen was so modern and complicated, someone had to be sent to explain how everything worked, and during the extensive renovations the couple had to live in the attic bedroom for nine months. Although Cynthia enjoyed entertaining in the larger rooms, Lennon could usually be found in a small sunroom at the back of the house overlooking the swimming pool, which was similar to his aunt&#x27;s conservatory in Liverpool. They had a cat called &quot;Mimi&quot;, named after Lennon&#x27;s aunt. Cynthia took care of Julian herself, without a nanny, although babysitters were frequently employed. She also did the cooking herself, but employed a housekeeper, gardener, and chauffeur, who lived off the premises.

When she passed her driving test, Lennon serially bought her a white Mini, a gold Porsche, a red Ferrari, and a green Volkswagen Beetle, usually as surprises without consulting her first. Cynthia enjoyed the closeness of Pattie Boyd and Maureen Starkey (Ringo Starr&#x27;s wife), as both lived nearby, often going on holiday together or shopping. She was often photographed at Beatles&#x27; movie premieres and special occasions, and sometimes with Lennon and Julian at home, which meant she had the role of a Beatle wife, as well as being a mother. The Lennons often went to a nightclub in central London until nearly dawn, after which she took Julian to school. Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians, and total strangers who Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs.

In 1965, she opened the front door of Kenwood to see a man who &quot;looked like a tramp&quot;, but with her husband&#x27;s features. He explained that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling her for the first time that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein&#x27;s business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles&#x27; fan mail. Lennon&#x27;s father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, &quot;Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can&#x27;t go anywhere. There&#x27;s something else I&#x27;m going to do, only I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I do know this isn&#x27;t it for me.&quot;

===Drugs===
Cynthia knew her husband took drugs like Preludin, and regularly smoked cannabis, but thought of them as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, at a dinner party given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd&#x27;s Mini Cooper at no more than 10 mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.

Lennon then started taking LSD on a regular basis in addition to his daily use of cannabis. After much encouragement from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, on the way to a party at Epstein&#x27;s country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: &quot;It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love.&quot; In 1970, Lennon confessed that he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: &quot;I used to just eat it all the time.&quot; In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John&#x27;s drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.

By 1967, Lennon&#x27;s aggressive edges from his childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours on end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another). Cynthia once complained, saying: &quot;What I&#x27;d like is a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me.&quot; Lennon replied with, &quot;OK, I know, we&#x27;ll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?&quot; Then adding, &quot;No, I&#x27;ve got these bloody songs to write. I have to work, to justify living.&quot; She understood his temperament, but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background.

===India and Ono===

The Beatles were scheduled to fly to India to visit the Maharishi for two or three months of Transcendental Meditation. Before they left, Cynthia found letters from Yoko Ono to Lennon which indicated he had been having contact with her over a period of some time. Lennon denied he was involved with Ono, explaining that she was just some &quot;crazy artist&quot; who wanted to be sponsored, although Ono kept up a stream of telephone calls and visits to Kenwood. On 15 February 1968, the Lennons flew to India, followed by the other Beatles and their partners four days later: Boyd, Asher, and Maureen Starkey. The division between the sexes was emphasised by the male musicians sitting outside at night composing songs, while their partners gathered together in one of their rooms, often talking about life as the wife or partner of a Beatle. The Lennons shared a four-poster bed at the ashram, with Lennon playing guitar and Cynthia drawing and writing poetry between their long sessions of meditation.

&quot;Magic Alex&quot; (Greek-born Alex Mardas, who controlled Apple Electronics) arrived later, smuggling in alcohol from the nearest village as it was not allowed in the ashram. After two weeks, Lennon asked to sleep in a separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Every morning, Lennon would walk to the local post office to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: &quot;I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end.&quot; Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, &quot;The Beatles in Rishikesh&quot;, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia&#x27;s confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, Cynthia later spoke about her time there, saying: &quot;I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras.&quot;

===Divorce===
During the flight back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed that he had been involved with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and &quot;thousands&quot; of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon&#x27;s confession, she knew women were attracted to him, &quot;like moths to a flame.&quot; Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become the White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o&#x27;clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other&#x27;s eyes, and then found Ono&#x27;s slippers outside the Lennons&#x27; bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away.

Lennon seemed absolutely normal when she returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s you I love Cyn ... I love you now more than ever before.&quot; Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and &quot;send her back to Hoylake.&quot; She said in 2005: &quot;The mere fact that &#x27;Magic Alex&#x27; [Mardas] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy&quot; ... [for Lennon and Ono] &quot;to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad.&quot; As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: &quot;Suing &quot;me&quot; for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?&quot; When the news of Ono&#x27;s pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968.

Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon&#x27;s refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025), telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025), £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in 2025), and custody of Julian. A further £100,000 was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit at age 21, and until then his mother would receive the interest payments. The trust deed had a codicil which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian&#x27;s inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025).

Cynthia lived for a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but returned to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no &quot;innocent little flower.&quot; McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became &quot;Hey Jude.&quot; Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: &quot;We&#x27;d been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be &quot;personae non gratae&quot; and out of my life.&quot; Cynthia recalled, &quot;I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; in the car. I will never forget Paul&#x27;s gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.&quot;

Cynthia was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together and answered: &quot;It was too soppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn&#x27;t do that in those days.&quot; In contrast, Lennon said that he wrote the 1965 song &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; about an affair he was having but rendered it in &quot;gobbledegook&quot; so Cynthia would not know.
==Subsequent life==
On 31 July 1970, Cynthia married Roberto Bassanini, whom she had started dating after parting with Lennon; the couple divorced in 1973. Cynthia then opened a restaurant in Ruthin, Wales, called Oliver&#x27;s Bistro, which also had a B&amp;B above the premises. She enrolled her son into the Ruthin School and he later joined the local Combined Cadet Force. During Lennon&#x27;s separation from Ono in 1973–74, his partner at the time, May Pang, tried to get Lennon to spend more time with his son, forming a friendship with Cynthia in the process, which continued even after John Lennon and Yoko Ono were reconciled. A meeting during this period was the last time Cynthia saw John. Julian had been allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself, but John Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex-wife also wanted to be present, saying, &quot;She [Cynthia] thought she could walk back in &#x27;cos I wasn&#x27;t with Yoko!&quot; After his reconciliation with Ono, Lennon complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him.

On 1 May 1976, Cynthia married John Twist, a television engineer from Lancashire. She published a memoir during their time together, &quot;A Twist of Lennon&quot;, in 1978, about her life before and with Lennon and containing her own illustrations and poetry. Lennon tried to stop the publication of the book after an excerpt was published in a newspaper. Cynthia&#x27;s memoir gained renewed interest and went to a third printing of 200,000 copies in the weeks after Lennon&#x27;s death. She and Twist separated in 1981 and were divorced in 1982. Cynthia sold the Bistro and changed her name back to Lennon by deed poll, later commenting about why it was financially necessary, &quot;Do you imagine I would have been awarded a three-year contract to design bedding and textiles [for Vantona Vyella in 1983] with the name Powell? Neither did they. When it is necessary to earn a living, it is necessary to bite the bullet and take the flack.&quot;

Cynthia began a relationship with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981, who became her partner for 17 years as well as her business manager, living in Penrith, Cumbria. At the time, Cynthia said, &quot;Jim has never felt he&#x27;s living in John Lennon&#x27;s shadow. He&#x27;s four years younger than me and wasn&#x27;t really part of that whole Beatles&#x27; scene.&quot; They later lived on the Isle of Man and then in Normandy for some years but separated in 1998.

Cynthia had kept mementos of Lennon for years but began auctioning them off after his death. This included a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie&#x27;s in August 1981. With Cynthia&#x27;s finances in an unsteady state – she would say in 1999 that &quot;Apart from John, the men I have fallen in love with have never been good at earning a living&quot; – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. Cynthia said at the time, &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it&#x27;s time for a change.&quot; Another set of items, including some of Lennon&#x27;s drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. Cynthia later said, &quot;I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clear-out, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie&#x27;s. When you have to pay the bills, you&#x27;re not proud and you can&#x27;t take it with you.&quot;

Over the years, Cynthia entered some failed business ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named &quot;Woman&quot; (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon&#x27;s—at 13/14 Upper St Martin&#x27;s Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as &quot;Rubber Sole&quot; (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Steak&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane Pâté&quot;. It had a short life as a business venture, as it was considered to be far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her.

The Beatles&#x27; Hamburg days were the subject of the 1994 film &quot;Backbeat&quot;, with Jennifer Ehle portraying Cynthia Powell. The film characterises Lennon and Cynthia&#x27;s relationship as one that will eventually be doomed by their wanting different things from life but with Lennon not wanting to hurt her. Cynthia later complained that the film made her out &quot;as a clingy, dim, little girlfriend in a headscarf.&quot; In another film covering the early years of the pre-fame Beatles, the 1979 &quot;Birth of the Beatles&quot;, Cynthia was portrayed by Wendy Morgan. Cynthia was portrayed in 2000 television film &quot;In His Life: The John Lennon Story&quot; by Gillian Kearney; the negative aspects of John&#x27;s treatment of her were not overlooked. Cynthia was subsequently portrayed in the troubled, Ono-centric 2005 American musical &quot;Lennon&quot;, with her character – played by Julia Murney – gaining a little more prominence during one of the show&#x27;s rewrites. Cynthia&#x27;s life had a more central role in the 2010 BBC Four film &quot;Lennon Naked&quot;, with Claudie Blakley playing the part. Cynthia&#x27;s character was absent from the 2009 British film &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot;, which purported to cover the story of Lennon from 1955 to 1960 but focused on his relationships with his aunt and mother.

In 1995, Cynthia made her recording début with a rendition of &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; which, produced by McCartney, had been a number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968. It failed to chart. Whilst she was living in Normandy, an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road&#x27;s KDK Gallery in 1999. By the 1990s, Cynthia was appearing at some Beatles conventions but appeared ambivalent about doing so. At times, Cynthia maintained that she was moving on with her life and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said in a 1999 profile, &quot;In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost in spite of herself – got caught up with one of the most extraordinary men of modern times. More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended, she is as entangled as ever.&quot;

==Later years and death==

In 2002, Cynthia married Noel Charles, a Barbadian nightclub owner. In September 2005, she published a new biography, &quot;John&quot;, re-examining her life with Lennon and the years afterwards, including the events following his death. Michel Faber, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said of the book: &quot;&quot;John&quot; is Cynthia&#x27;s attempt to prove how much more she was worth. In theory, the disclosures of Lennon&#x27;s loyal partner from 1958 to 1968 cannot fail to be valuable. On the page, the potential withers.&quot; Rachael Donadio in the New York Times said that the book &quot;paints the picture of a man wounded by the deaths of family and friends, and tells the difficult story of the domestic front during Beatlemania.&quot; In the foreword, Julian Lennon wrote, &quot;If there is to be a balanced picture of Dad&#x27;s life, then Mum&#x27;s side of the story is long overdue.&quot; 

In 2006, Cynthia and Julian attended the Las Vegas premiere of the Cirque du Soleil production of &quot;Love&quot;, which marked a rare public appearance with Ono. In 2009, Cynthia and Julian opened an exhibition of memorabilia at The Beatles Story exhibition in Liverpool, and she and Pattie Boyd staged a first-ever joint appearance at the opening of the Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Yerevan, Armenia. On 30 September 2010, Julian opened his &quot;Timeless&quot; exhibition of photographs at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York. In attendance were Cynthia, Ono, Sean, and Pang, which was the first time all five had been in the same room together.

The John Lennon Peace Monument was unveiled by Cynthia and Julian at a ceremony in Chavasse Park, Liverpool, on 9 October 2010 to celebrate the anniversary of Lennon&#x27;s 70th birthday. Cynthia lived with her husband, Noel, on the Spanish island of Majorca until his death on 11 March 2013.

On 1 April 2015, Cynthia died of cancer at her home in Majorca with Julian by her side; she was 75 years old. Public messages of condolence were made by McCartney and Starr, with McCartney saying, &quot;She was a lovely lady who I&#x27;ve known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all&quot;, and Starr saying, &quot;Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia.&quot; Ono issued a statement, emphasising the position she held in common: &quot;Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy. Cynthia and I understood each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future.&quot; Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, who had spent considerable time with Cynthia and Lennon in the 1960s while researching his book, remembered her as &quot;a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet, reserved and calm.&quot;

<text>Nalcrest is a retirement community in Polk County, Florida, United States. The community&#x27;s ZIP code is 33856. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The community&#x27;s name is an acronym for National Association of Letter Carriers Retirement, Education, Security and Training, as it was designed by and continues to be operated by the Nalcrest Foundation, Inc., a branch of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), the union representing United States Postal Service city letter carriers. It was the brainchild of William Doherty, the first United States Ambassador to Jamaica and NALC President from 1941 to 1962.

== History and structure ==
Construction began in July 1962 and the community opened in 1963. Initially, due to HUD regulations, residency was open to both NALC members and others, but when the mortgage was paid in 2002, the HUD restrictions were removed and residency is now limited to NALC retirees in good standing only.

The community consists of , of which are developed into 500 garden-style apartments. The remaining are undeveloped and include a manmade lake of 15 acres, around which the community is developed and connects to the 7,500 acre Lake Weohyakapka.

The apartments are a mix of efficiency and one-bedroom units, and all are on ground level. Units are leased on an annual basis and the rental rate includes water, sewer, trash removal, basic cable TV, interior/exterior maintenance, and use of the community&#x27;s recreational facilities (but not electricity). Pets are not permitted. In addition to being NALC retirees in good standing, tenants must also be able to care for themselves and for housekeeping chores, as the community is not an assisted living facility and does not have an on-site physician.

Among the most interesting features of the community is that, despite being a retirement community for postal letter carriers, there is no home mail delivery – residents must pick up their mail at the post office in the Town Center.

== Activities ==
The community has a pool, tennis court, driving range, bocce and horseshoe pits, and a softball field.

<text>Brace Beemer (December 9, 1902 – March 1, 1965) was an American radio actor and announcer at radio station WXYZ (AM), Detroit, Michigan.

He is best known as the radio voice of the Lone Ranger.

==&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;==
Brace Beemer became the third radio voice of the Lone Ranger on April 18, 1941, after the death of Earle Graser and remained so until the series&#x27;s last new episode on September 3, 1954. During the 13 years that Beemer played the title character, he was required by contract to restrict his radio acting to that one role until the program left the air. 

The experienced and popular Western film actor, Clayton Moore, was chosen to take over the role for the television series. Although Beemer had the right voice and had made many public appearances as the Ranger, he had no experience as a film actor, as he preferred radio and live performing to television. However, Beemer&#x27;s voice as the character was so familiar that Moore imitated his sound in the earliest TV episodes.

==Other roles==
Beemer also portrayed Sergeant William Preston of the Yukon on &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot;, for a brief time after the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; series ended.

Beemer&#x27;s last TV appearance was an interview with former film actor Bill Kennedy on his &quot;Bill Kennedy Showtime&quot; program on CKLW TV9 from Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Beemer died the next day.

==Early years==
Brace Bell Beemer was born at his home on Cherry Street in Mount Carmel, Illinois on December 9, 1902, the son of Joseph D. Beemer and Bertina (Bell) Beemer.

He attended high school in Vincennes, Indiana, leaving school to enlist in the military.

When Beemer was 14, he misrepresented his age to participate in World War I. He served with &quot;Battery E, 150th field artillery, and was wounded in action in France May 27,&quot; 1918. He was said to be the youngest sergeant in that war.

==Later years==
Beemer resided in Oxford Township, Michigan. He raised thoroughbred horses on his 300-acre ranch, Paint Creek Acres.
The barn where the great white stallion &quot;Silver&quot; used to stay still stands, and it’s rumored that the horse was buried in the woods on the property.

==Death==
Brace Beemer died of a heart attack March 1, 1965. He is buried in White Chapel Cemetery in Troy, Michigan. At the time of his death, he was using his famous &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; voice in automobile commercials running on radio stations.

<text>The Vickers Valentia was a 1920s British flying boat designed during the First World War.

==History==
Three Valentia prototypes were built by the Vickers Company at their Barrow works (Walney Island perhaps), having been ordered in May 1918 as a potential replacement for the Felixstowe F.5. The hull was built by S.E.Saunders works at Cowes. The first of the three (Serial Number N124) first flew on 5 March 1921, when Stanley Cockerell began test-flying it over the Solent. N124 was damaged on landing in June 1921 and was dismantled, the second N125 forced landed on its delivery flight on 15 March 1922 The third flying boat N126 was delivered in 1923 and used for trials until it was withdrawn from use in November 1924.

The name was later re-used for a transport aircraft, the Vickers Type 264 Valentia.

<text>Reading West was a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament.

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Its area was transferred to the new constituencies of Earley and Woodley (Whitley ward), Reading Central (Battle, Minster and Southcote wards), and Reading West and Mid Berkshire (all other wards). These constituencies were first contested at the 2024 general election.

== Constituency profile ==
Since its 1983 creation the constituency was a bellwether paradigm example of a marginal seat. Boundary changes for the 2010 election took in areas of population expansion to the east in new largely private sector housing estates. Unemployment is close to the regional average, which is lower than the national average and the constituency has seen a marked increase in properties and property prices throughout the 2001 to 2011 period which saw town centre regeneration and investment by a Labour Party-controlled council enhanced by Reading railway station hub improvements and enterprise areas equally.

== History ==
The Reading West parliamentary constituency was first contested in 1983, when it was won by a member of the Conservative Party, Tony Durant, the sitting MP for the abolished Reading North constituency. He held the seat through two subsequent general elections until he retired at the 1997 election.

The constituency was then won by Martin Salter for Labour, as part of the landslide that brought Labour back to power under Tony Blair. Salter held the seat through the 13 years of Labour government until Parliament was dissolved in April 2010, but did not stand in the 2010 general election, when Alok Sharma won the seat for the Conservatives.

Sharma held several posts within government, including serving in the Cabinet as the President for COP26 from January 2021 until October 2022.

== Boundaries and boundary changes ==

1983–1997

* The Borough of Reading wards of Battle, Katesgrove, Kentwood, Minster, Norcot, Southcote, and Tilehurst; and
* The District of Newbury wards of Calcot, Pangbourne, Purley, Theale, and Tilehurst.

&quot;Formed as a county constituency, largely from parts of the abolished constituency of Reading North. Extended westwards to include parts of Newbury.&quot;

1997–2010

* The Borough of Reading wards of Battle, Kentwood, Minster, Norcot, Southcote, Tilehurst, and Whitley; and
* The District of Newbury wards of Calcot, Pangbourne, Purley, Theale, and Tilehurst.

&quot;The boundary with Reading East was realigned, gaining Whitley ward and losing Katesgrove ward.&quot;

2010–2024

* The Borough of Reading wards of Battle, Kentwood, Minster, Norcot, Southcote, Tilehurst, and Whitley; and
* The District of West Berkshire wards of Birch Copse, Calcot, Pangbourne, Purley on Thames, Theale, and Westwood.

&quot;Marginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.&quot;

The constituency was bordered by the seats of Newbury, Henley, Reading East, and Wokingham.

<doc id="1149647" wikidata="Q5440204" url="?curid=1149647" title="Federal Employees Health Benefits Program">
<text>The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program is a system of &quot;managed competition&quot; through which employee health benefits are provided to civilian government employees and annuitants of the United States government. 
The government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not to exceed 75% of the premium for any one plan (calculated separately for individual and family coverage).

The FEHB program allows some insurance companies, employee associations, and labor unions to market health insurance plans to governmental employees. The program is administered by the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

==History==
The program was created in 1960. Employer sponsorship of health insurance in the United States became prevalent during World War II, as one of the few ways by which employers could escape wage and price control limitations on employee wages. The government originally proposed a system that would revolve around a dominant government-directed plan, but unions and employee associations, which had sponsored their own plans, protested. Reflecting the political pressure thus created, the Congress modified the Executive Branch proposal and all existing plans were &quot;grandfathered&quot; into the program. 

==Plans==

In 2010 about 250 plans participate in the program. About 20 plans are nationwide or almost nationwide, such as the ones offered by some employee unions such as the National Association of Letter Carriers, by some employee associations such as GEHA, and by national insurance companies such as Aetna and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association on behalf of its member companies. There are about 230 locally available plans, almost all Health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The FEHBP&#x27;s cost is about $40 billion in 2010, including both premiums and out-of-pocket costs. About four million employees and annuitants are enrolled, totaling eight million people when dependents are included.

There are three broad types of plans available on the FEHB program: fee-for-service and preferred provider organization (PPO), usually offered in combination; HMOs; and high-deductible health plans and other consumer-driven plans. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, plans open to all federal employees and annuitants include 10 fee-for-service and PPO plans, seven HMOs, and eight high-deductible and consumer-driven plans.

In the FEHB program the federal government sets minimal standards that, if met by an insurance company, allows it to participate in the program. The result is numerous competing insurance plans that are available to federal employees. Local plans have ready access to participation in the program, but the underlying statute prohibits entry of new national plans. Because OPM requires plans to price offerings closely to the health care costs of enrollees, and to offer comprehensive benefits, there is broad similarity in plan offerings. However, total premiums can vary substantially, and in 2010 the lowest cost plan option had a self-only premium cost of about $2,800 and the highest cost plan option for self-only enrollment was about $7,200. As an example of benefit variation, a cap of about $5,000 a year on potential out-of-pocket costs for self-only enrollment is found in a number of plans, but in some plans the cap may reach $15,000 or more (HMOs typically have no cap, but control potential cost exposure by using copayments).

The FEHB program has on several occasions been proposed as a model for national health insurance or a program that could directly enroll the uninsured. In the 2004 presidential campaign, Senator John Kerry proposed opening enrollment in this plan to all Americans. In enacting the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, the Congress modeled the reformed Medicare Advantage program and the new Medicare Part D Prescription Drug program after the FEHB program.

<text>ALGO is an algebraic programming language developed for the Bendix G-15 computer.

ALGO was one of several programming languages inspired by the &quot;Preliminary Report on the International Algorithmic Language&quot; written in Zürich in 1958. This report underwent several modifications before becoming the Revised Report on which most ALGOL implementations are based. As a result, ALGO and other early ALGOL-related languages have a very different syntax from ALGOL 60.

== Example ==
Here is the Trabb Pardo – Knuth algorithm in ALGO:

<text>Chimney Rock is a prominent geological rock formation in Morrill County in western Nebraska. Rising nearly 300 feet (91 m) above the surrounding North Platte River valley, the peak of Chimney Rock is above sea level. The formation served as a landmark along the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail during the mid-19th century. The trails ran along the north side of the rock, which remains a visible landmark for modern travelers along U.S. Route 26 and Nebraska Highway 92. Chimney Rock National Historic Site was designated in 1956 and is an affiliated area of the National Park Service, operated by History Nebraska. Chimney Rock was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

==History==

Prior to exploration and settlement by European immigrants, the Native Americans of the areamainly the Lakota Siouxwould refer to this formation by a term which meant &quot;elk penis&quot;. The first non-natives to see the pillar were probably the Astorians of Robert Stuart in their eastward journey from the Pacific Ocean in 1813. Chimney Rock was recorded in many journals after the Stuart expedition.

The name &quot;Chimney Rock&quot; probably originated from early fur traders. The first recorded mention of &quot;Chimney Rock&quot; was in 1827 by Joshua Pilcher. Pilcher had journeyed up the Platte River valley to the Salt Lake rendezvous of the Rocky Mountain fur trappers. The formation went through a variety of names before becoming Chimney Rock such as Chimley Rock and Chimney Tower, as well as euphemisms based on the original Native American name, such as Elk&#x27;s Peak and Elk Brick.

A small town named Chimney Rock once stood near the base of the formation. A post office was established at the town of Chimney Rock in 1913, and remained in operation until 1922.

Based on sketches, paintings, written accounts, and the 1897 photograph by Darton, Chimney Rock was taller when it was first seen by settlers, but has since been reduced in height by erosion, lightning, and reportedly by cannon fire from the ground and from aircraft.

==Geology==
Chimney Rock consists primarily of Brule clay interlayered with volcanic ash and Arikaree sandstone. The harder sandstone layers near the top have protected the pillar since it broke away from the retreating cliff line to the south. Chimney Rock rises approximately above its surroundings.

==Today==
Chimney Rock was designated a National Historic Site on August 9, 1956, and is a National Park Service affiliated area, maintained and administered by History Nebraska with NPS technical support. Chimney Rock and Independence Rock further west in Wyoming are two of the prominent features along the Oregon Trail. Chimney Rock is located 20 miles southeast of Scotts Bluff National Monument, on Nebraska Highway 92.

The Ethel and Christopher J. Abbot Visitor Center features museum exhibits and a video about pioneers and the migrations in the West, as well as a gift shop.

On March 1, 2006, the Nebraska State Quarter was released. The quarter features a covered wagon headed west past Chimney Rock, commemorating Nebraska&#x27;s role in westward migration.

<text>Baron François Joseph Bosio (19 March 1768 – 29 July 1845) was a Monegasque sculptor who achieved distinction in the first quarter of the nineteenth century with his work for Napoleon and for the restored French monarchy.

==Biography==

Born in Monaco, Bosio was given a scholarship by prince Honoré I to study in Paris with the eminent sculptor Augustin Pajou. After brief service in the Revolutionary army he lived in Florence, Rome and Naples, providing sculpture for churches under the French hegemony in Italy in the 1790s. He was recruited by Dominique Vivant Denon in 1808 to make bas-reliefs for the monumental column in the Place Vendôme in Paris and also to serve as portrait sculptor to Emperor Napoleon I and his family. It was in this capacity that he produced some of his finest work, notably marble portrait busts of the Empress Josephine, which was also modelled in biscuit Sèvres porcelain, and of Queen Hortense (about 1810), which was also cast in bronze by Ravrio.

Louis XVIII made Bosio a Knight of the Order of Saint Michael in 1821 and appointed him &quot;premier sculpteur du Roi&quot;. In 1828, Bosio saw his grandiose equestrian sculpture of Louis XIV erected in the Place des Victoires in Paris and was made an Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. He was made a baron by Charles X of France in 1825. Though under Louis-Philippe he was stripped of his titles, he continued to receive official commissions, as the ablest portrait sculptor in Paris, and created the statue of Napoleon for the Column of the Grande Armée in 1840 under Napoleon III. He died in Paris.

Apart from the imperial busts and the statue of Louis XVI, other important works included the quadriga of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and the statue of &quot;Hercules fighting Acheloos transformed into a snake&quot; (&quot;illustration&quot;) in the Louvre. Many of his most important sculptures and statues can today be found in the Louvre museum in Paris.

A study of Bosio was published by L. Barbarin, &quot;Etude sur Bosio, sa vie et son oeuvre&quot; (Monaco) 1910.

<doc id="1149660" wikidata="Q4035577" url="?curid=1149660" title="CD36">
<text>CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36), also known as platelet glycoprotein 4, fatty acid translocase (FAT), scavenger receptor class B member 3 (SCARB3), and glycoproteins 88 (GP88), IIIb (GPIIIB), or IV (GPIV) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CD36&quot; gene. The CD36 antigen is an integral membrane protein found on the surface of many cell types in vertebrate animals. It imports fatty acids inside cells and is a member of the class B scavenger receptor family of cell surface proteins. CD36 binds many ligands including collagen, thrombospondin, erythrocytes parasitized with &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, oxidized low density lipoprotein, native lipoproteins, oxidized phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids.

Work in genetically modified rodents suggest a role for CD36 in fatty acid metabolism, heart disease, taste, and dietary fat processing in the intestine. It may be involved in glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and various cancers, mostly of epithelial origin (breast, prostate, ovary, and colon) and also for hepatic carcinoma and gliomas.

== Structure ==

=== Primary ===

In humans, rats and mice, CD36 consists of 472 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 53,000 Da. However, CD36 is extensively glycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight of 88,000 Da as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

=== Tertiary ===

Using Kyte–Doolittle analysis, the amino acid sequence of CD36 predicts a hydrophobic region near each end of the protein large enough to span cellular membranes. Based on this notion and the observation that CD36 is found on the surface of cells, CD36 is thought to have a &#x27;hairpin-like&#x27; structure with α-helices at the C- and N- termini projecting through the membrane and a larger extracellular loop (Fig. 1). This topology is supported by transfection experiments in cultured cells using deletion mutants of CD36.

Based on the crystal structure of the homologous SCARB2, a model of the extracellular domain of CD36 has been produced. Like SCARB2, CD36 is proposed to contain an antiparallel β-barrel core with many short α-helices adorning it. The structure is predicted to contain a hydrophobic transport tunnel. 
Disulfide linkages between 4 of the 6 cysteine residues in the extracellular loop are required for efficient intracellular processing and transport of CD36 to the plasma membrane. It is not clear what role these linkages play on the function of the mature CD36 protein on the cell surface.

=== Posttranslational modification ===

Besides glycosylation, additional post-translational modifications have been reported for CD36. CD36 is modified with 4 palmitoyl chains, 2 on each of the two intracellular domains. The function of these lipid modifications is currently unknown but they likely promote the association of CD36 with the membrane and possibly lipid rafts which appear to be important for some CD36 functions. CD36 could be also phosphorylated at Y62, T92, T323, ubiquitinated at K56, K469, K472 and acetylated at K52, K56, K166, K231, K394, K398, K403.

=== Protein-protein interactions ===

In the absence of ligand, membrane bound CD36 exists primarily in a monomeric state. However exposure to the thrombospondin ligand causes CD36 to dimerize. This dimerization has been proposed to play an important role in CD36 signal transduction.

== Genetics ==

In humans, the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 at band 11.2 (7q11.2) and is encoded by 15 exons that extend over more than 32 kilobases. Both the 5&#x27; and the 3&#x27; untranslated regions contain introns: the 5&#x27; with two and the 3&#x27; one. Exons 1, 2 and first 89 nucleotides of exon 3 and as well as exon 15 are non-coding. Exon 3 contains encodes the N-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The C-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions is encoded by exon 14. The extracellular domain is encoded by the central 11 exons. Alternative splicing of the untranslated regions gives rise to at least two mRNA species.

The transcription initiation site of the CD36 gene has been mapped to 289 nucleotides upstream from the translational start codon and a TATA box and several putative cis regulatory regions lie further 5&#x27;. A binding site for PEBP2/CBF factors has been identified between -158 and -90 and disruption of this site reduces expression. The gene is the transcriptional control of the nuclear receptor PPAR/RXR heterodimer (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor – Retinoid X receptor) and gene expression can be up regulated using synthetic and natural ligands for PPAR and RXR, including the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs and the vitamin A metabolite 9-cis-retinoic acid respectively.

== Tissue distribution ==

CD36 is found on platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, differentiated adipocytes, skeletal muscle, mammary epithelial cells, spleen cells and some skin microdermal endothelial cells.

== Function ==

The protein itself belongs to the class B scavenger receptor family which includes receptors for selective cholesteryl ester uptake, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMP-II).

CD36 interacts with a number of ligands, including collagen types I and IV, thrombospondin, erythrocytes parasitized with &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, platelet-agglutinating protein p37, oxidized low density lipoprotein and long-chain fatty acids.

On macrophages CD36 forms part of a non-opsonic receptor (the scavenger receptor CD36/alpha-v beta-3 complex) and is involved in phagocytosis.

CD36 has also been implicated in hemostasis, thrombosis, malaria, inflammation, lipid metabolism and atherogenesis.

On binding a ligand the protein and ligand are internalized. This internalization is independent of macropinocytosis and occurs by an actin dependent mechanism requiring the activation Src-family kinases, JNK and Rho-family GTPases. Unlike macropinocytosis this process is not affected by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Na+/H+ exchange.

CD36 ligands have also been shown to promote sterile inflammation through assembly of a Toll-like receptor 4 and 6 heterodimer.

Recently, CD36 was linked to store-operated calcium flux, phospholipase A2 activation, and production of prostaglandin E2

CD36 function in long-chain fatty acid uptake and signaling can be irreversibly inhibited by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), which binds lysine 164 within a hydrophobic pocket shared by several CD36 ligands, e.g. fatty acid and oxLDL. Recent research concluded that CD36 is involved in the fat taste transduction (oleogustus).

== Clinical significance ==

=== Malaria ===

Infections with the human malaria parasite &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; are characterized by sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature forms of the parasite and CD36 has been shown to be a major sequestration receptor on microvascular endothelial cells. Parasitised erythrocytes adhere to endothelium at the trophozoite/ stage simultaneous with the appearance of the &quot;var&quot; gene product (erythrocyte membrane protein 1) on the erythrocyte surface. The appearance of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the erythrocyte surface is a temperature dependent phenomenon which is due to increased protein trafficking to the erythrocyte surface at the raised temperature. PfEMP1 can bind other endothelial receptors - thrombospondin (TSP) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) – in addition to CD36 - and genes other than PfEMP1 also bind to CD36: cytoadherence linked protein (clag) and sequestrin. The PfEMP1 binding site on CD36 is known to be located on exon 5.

CD36 on the surface of the platelets has been shown to be involved in adherence but direct adherence to the endothelium by the infected erythrocytes also occurs. Autoaggregation of infected erythrocytes by platelets has been shown to correlate with severe malaria and cerebral malaria in particular and antiplatelet antibodies may offer some protection.

Several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in CD36 are protective against malaria: mutations in the promoters and within introns and in exon 5 reduce the risk of severe malaria. Gene diversity studies suggest there has been positive selection on this gene presumably due to malarial selection pressure. Dissenting reports are also known 
suggesting that CD36 is not the sole determinant of severe malaria. In addition a role for CD36 has been found in the clearance of gametocytes (stages I and II).

CD36 has been shown to have a role in the innate immune response to malaria in mouse models. Compared with wild type mice CD36 (-/-) mice the cytokine induction response and parasite clearance were impaired. Earlier peak parasitemias, higher parasite densities and higher mortality were noted. It is thought that CD36 is involved in the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; glycophosphatidylinositol (PfGPI) induced MAPK activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. When macrophages were exposed to PfGPI the proteins ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and c-Jun became phosphorylated. All these proteins are involved as secondary messengers in the immune response. These responses were blunted in the CD36 (-/-) mice. Also in the CD36 (-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less TNF-alpha on exposure to PfGPI. Work is ongoing to determine how these exactly how these responses provide protection against malaria.

=== CD36 deficiency and alloimmune thrombocytopenia ===

CD36 is also known as glycoprotein IV (gpIV) or glycoprotein IIIb (gpIIIb) in platelets and gives rise to the Naka antigen. The Naka null phenotype is found in 0.3% of Caucasians and appears to be asymptomatic. The null phenotype is more common in African (2.5%), Japanese, and other Asian populations (5-11%).

Mutations in the human CD36 gene were first identified in a patient who, despite multiple platelet transfusions, continued to exhibit low platelet levels. This condition is known as refractoriness to platelet transfusion. Subsequent studies have shown that CD36 found on the surface of platelets. This antigen is recognized by the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) OKM5 and OKM8. It is bound by the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; protein sequestrin.

Depending on the nature of the mutation in codon 90 CD36 may be absent either on both platelets and monocytes (type 1) or platelets alone (type 2). Type 2 has been divided into two subtypes - a and b. Deficiency restricted to the platelets alone is known as type 2a; if CD36 is also absent from the erythroblasts the phenotype is classified as type 2b. The molecular basis is known for some cases: T1264G in both Kenyans and Gambians; C478T (50%), 539 deletion of AC and 1159 insertion of an A, 1438-1449 deletion and a combined 839-841 deletion GAG and insertion of AAAAC in Japanese.

In a study of 827 apparently healthy Japanese volunteers, type I and II deficiencies were found in 8 (1.0%) and 48 (5.8%) respectively. In 1127 healthy French blood donors (almost all of whom were white Europeans) no CD36 deficiency was found. In a second group only 1 of 301 white test subjects was found to be CD36 deficient. 16 of the 206 sub-Saharan black Africans and 1 of 148 black Caribbeans were found to be CD36 -ve. Three of 13 CD36 -ve persons examined had anti CD36 antibodies. In a group of 250 black American blood donors 6 (2.4%) were found to be Naka antigen negative.

CD36 deficiency may be a cause of post transfusion purpura.

=== Blood pressure ===
Below normal levels of CD36 expression in the kidneys has been implicated as a genetic risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure).

=== Fatty acid uptake ===

An association with myocardial fatty acid uptake in humans has been noted. The data suggest a link between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and CD36 but this needs to be confirmed.

=== Tuberculosis ===

RNAi screening in a &quot;Drosophila&quot; model has revealed that a member of the CD36 family is required for phagocytosis of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; into macrophage phagosomes.

=== Toxoplasmosis ===

Avirulent strains of &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; bind to CD36 but virulent parasites fail to engage CD36. In mice, CD36 is required for disease tolerance but not for the development of immunity or resistance.

=== Obesity ===

CD36&#x27;s association with the ability to taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (&quot;P. obesus&quot;) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the obese and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in the obese mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.

There has been some investigation into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between the high and low groups. This study demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.

=== Establishment of cellular senescence ===

Reducing the burden of senescent cells, or reducing their inflammatory secretome through CD36 neutralization, accelerates regeneration in young and old mice.

==Cancer==

CD36 plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis, which may be a therapeutic strategy for controlling the spread of cancer. Some data from &quot;in vitro&quot; and animal studies suggested that fatty acid uptake through CD36 may promote cancer cell migration and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and potentially other cancers; there was limited data from observational studies in people that low CD36 may correlate with a slightly better outcome in glioblastoma.

== Interactions ==

CD36 has been shown to interact with FYN.

==Related proteins==
Other human scavenger receptors related to CD36 are SCARB1 and SCARB2 proteins.

<text>An e-reader, also known as an e-book reader, is a portable electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading e-books and periodicals. E-readers have a similar form factor to a tablet; usually use electronic paper resulting in better screen readability, especially in bright sunlight; and have longer battery life when compared to a tablet. An e-reader&#x27;s battery will typically last for multiple weeks. In contrast to an e-reader, a tablet has a screen capable of higher refresh rates which make them more suitable for interaction such as playing a video game or watching a video clip.

==Types of electronic-paper displays==

All electronic paper types offer lower power consumption and better sunlight contrast than LCDs. E Ink displays don&#x27;t produce any light by themselves, so some models offer a frontlight for reading in dark areas.
* E ink: E Ink Corporation&#x27;s 1st-generation technology, also known as E Ink Vizplex. Although &quot;eInk&quot; may be used to talk about all electronic paper displays, &quot;eInk&quot; and &quot;E Ink&quot; are trademarked by E Ink, which provides the majority of the electronic paper displays used in devices.
* E Ink Pearl: E Ink&#x27;s 2nd-generation technology, which has higher contrast and a greater number of different levels of gray than their earlier technology. A further revision of Pearl is Mobius, which uses flexible plastic in the display.
* E Ink Triton: E Ink&#x27;s 3rd-generation technology that featured the ability to show color in the display.
* E Ink Carta: E Ink&#x27;s 4th-generation technology, which has higher contrast and a greater number of different levels of gray than their earlier technology; the displays have a pixel density between 212 and 300 ppi.
* E Ink Kaleido: E Ink&#x27;s colour e-paper display supporting up to 4096 colours, used in various e-readers such as BOOX Go Color 7 and Kobo Libra Colour
* SiPix: A former competitor to E Ink, which had displays with almost instantaneous page turns. It was acquired by E Ink in December 2012.
* LG Flex: Electronic paper that allows a flexible screen; is still in development. With these displays, the user is able to bend the e-reader without damaging it and can fold it up to put in a pocket.

Electronic-paper readers come in various sizes. Many small e-readers have display diagonal sizes around , while some of the large commercially available readers have display sizes around A5 () or A4 size ().

== Commercially available devices sold by maker or designer ==

Notes:
* Library DRM compatible – Can be used to borrow e-books from public libraries, e.g. the EPUB and/or PDF formats with digital-rights-management (DRM) are supported.
* &quot;microSDHC&quot; is the most popular format for external memory cards. Devices which support a different card have that format listed.
* Listed are only products for which either the product itself or its company is notable, as shown by having a Wikipedia article (without notability notice).

<text>The diederik cuckoo (Chrysococcyx caprius), formerly dideric cuckoo or didric cuckoo is a member of the cuckoo family of birds, Cuculidae, which also includes the roadrunners and the anis.

==Taxonomy==
The diederik cuckoo was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus caprius&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The diederik cuckoo is now placed in the genus &quot;Chrysococcyx&quot; that was erected by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The species is monotypic.

The generic name &quot;Chrysococcyx &quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;khrusos&quot; meaning &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;kokkux&quot; meaning &quot;cuckoo&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;caprius&quot; is from the Latin &quot;cupreus&quot; meaning &quot;coppery&quot;. The common name &quot;diederik&quot; is from Afrikaans &quot;diedrik&quot;, an onomatopoeic rendition of the bird&#x27;s call.

==Description==

The diederik cuckoo is a smallish cuckoo at 18 to 20 cm. Adult males are glossy green above with copper-sheened areas on the back and whitish underparts. They have a broken white eye-stripe and a short, green malar stripe. All remiges have three to four white spots on the inner vanes. The four green outer tail feathers are tipped white, and the outermost pair are spotted white on both vanes.

Females show more copper above, and have coppery barring on the flanks. The underparts are often washed brownish.

Juveniles have a red bill, streaky throat and a white wing-bar. They are more copper-coloured above and browner below than the females, and the flank markings are brown blotches.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite. It lays a single egg mostly in the nests of weavers, especially the village weaver and the bishops in the genus &quot;Euplectes&quot;. For example, it has been recorded in red-collared widowbirds.

===Feeding===
The diederik cuckoo takes a variety of insects and insect larvae. It is a noisy species, with the persistent and loud &quot;deed-deed-deed-deed-er-ick&quot; call from which it gets its name. Usually four clear, roughly identical, notes followed by a little twitter.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a common resident breeder in Sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula. It has been recorded as far north as Cyprus (1982 &amp; 2023). It is a short-distance seasonal migrant, moving with the rains. It is a solitary bird, found in open woodland, savanna and riverside bushes.

<text>Warfhuizen (Gronings: &quot;Waarfhoezen&quot;) is a village in province of Groningen, located in the northern part of the Netherlands. It is part of the municipality of Het Hogeland.

Warfhuizen consists of two man-made mounds, called &quot;wierden&quot;, designed to escape the floodwaters of the Wadden, which flooded the whole region several times a year before dykes had been coed. The smaller mound was originally raised to protect a separate village called &quot;Burum&quot;. The village church stands on the larger mound.

==The Church==

The church belongs to the hermitage of Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden, one of the few hermitages in the Netherlands still inhabited by a hermit.

The church, which was first constructed in the 13th century, was replaced by a neo-classical building in 1858. Only the bell survived the ages and is even one of the oldest churchbells in the Netherlands. The building is dedicated to Saint Ludger and Our Lady under the title of &quot;the Enclosed Garden&quot;.

The present organ was built in 1910, but was in fact reconstructed from two organs of a much earlier date (17th and 18th century.)

The church is especially known for its statue of the Mother of Sorrows, sculpted by one of the renowned procession-sculptors of Seville, Miguel Bejarano Moreno. It is because of this very Andalusian image that some Spaniards living in the Netherlands use Warfhuizen as a place of (unofficial) pilgrimage. In the last years their habit spread to all Catholics in the region and even beyond: Warfhuizen became the northernmost Marian sanctuary of continental Europe.

A peculiar custom, unique for this shrine, is &#x27;the trading of the handkerchief&#x27;. It is said that visitors bring a new white handkerchief and ask the hermit to swap it with the one held by the sorrowful Virgin whose handkerchief is then presented to someone sick, lonely or elderly in the audience. Little is documented about this alleged custom. The origins of this particular custom are unknown, although a widespread rumor tells that it started with catholic pilgrims from the south of India and Sri Lanka, but the reasons behind this rumor are unexplained.

<doc id="1149674" wikidata="Q499954" url="?curid=1149674" title="Knurling">
<text>Knurling is a manufacturing process, typically conducted on a lathe, whereby a pattern of straight, angled or crossed lines is rolled into the material. Knurling can also refer to material that has a knurled pattern.

== Etymology ==
The terms &quot;knurl&quot; and &quot;knurled&quot; are from an earlier &quot;knur&quot; ‘knot in wood’ and the diminutive &quot;-le&quot;, from Middle English &quot;knaur&quot; or &quot;knarre&quot; ‘knot in wood; twisted rock; crag’. This descends from Old English &quot;cnearra&quot; but the vowel in Middle English may have been influenced by Old Norse &quot;knǫrr&quot; ‘merchant ship’ which was known as &quot;cnearr&quot; in Old English. The modern &quot;gnarl&quot; is a back-formation of &quot;gnarled&quot; which itself is first attested in Shakespeare&#x27;s works and is apparently a variant of &quot;knurled&quot;.

== Uses ==
Knurling produces indentations on a part of a workpiece, allowing hands or fingers to get a better grip on the knurled object than would be provided by the original smooth surface. Occasionally, the knurled pattern is a series of straight ridges or a helix of &quot;straight&quot; ridges rather than the more-usual criss-cross pattern.

Knurling may also be used as a repair method: because a rolled-in knurled surface has raised areas surrounding the depressed areas, these raised areas can make up for wear on the part. In the days when labor was cheap and parts expensive, this repair method was feasible on pistons of internal combustion engines, where the skirt of a worn piston was expanded to the nominal size using a knurling process. As auto parts have become less expensive, knurling has become less prevalent than it once was, and is specifically discouraged by the builders of performance engines.

Knurling can also be used when a component will be assembled into a low-precision component, for example a metal pin into a plastic molding. The outer surface of the metal pin is knurled so that the raised detail &quot;bites&quot; into the plastic irrespective of whether the size of the hole in the plastic closely matches the diameter of the pin.

Tool handles, mechanical pencils, the grips of pistols, barbell bars, the clamping surface of a motorcycle handlebar and the control knobs on electronic equipment are frequently knurled. Knurling is also used on the grips of darts and on the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Knurling is also found in many surgical instruments, where it is used for instrument identification, and for its ease of being brushed clean.

== Process ==

More common than knurl cutting, &quot;knurl rolling&quot; is usually accomplished using one or more very hard rollers that contain the reverse of the pattern to be imposed. It is possible for a &quot;straight&quot; knurl (not criss-crossed) to be pressed with a single roller, however the material needs to be supported adequately to avoid deformation. A criss-cross pattern can be accomplished using any of:
* A single roller that contains the reverse of the complete desired pattern. These are available to form either &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; patterns,
* A left-handed straight roller followed by a right-handed straight roller (or vice versa), or
* One or more left-handed rollers used simultaneously with one or more right-handed rollers.

Use stock with a circumference that&#x27;s a multiple of the circular pitch, or stock with a diameter of the circular pitch over π. Blank diameter is critical to quality knurling. The wrong blank diameter can cause the knurl(s) to double track, giving a pattern finer than the knurl was designed to produce, one that is generally unsatisfactory. Picking the correct stock diameter is very similar to having two gears of the same diametrical pitch that fit together. Every time you add a tooth, the diameter increases by a discrete amount. There are no in-between diameters that work correctly. The same is true of knurls and the blank to be knurled, though fortunately knurls do tolerate a certain amount of error before problems occur. The integer number of knurls for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom to the top of the pattern. By comparison, for cut knurls, the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.

Hand knurling tools are available. These resemble pipecutters but contain knurling wheels rather than cutting wheels. Usually, three wheels are carried by the tool: two left-handed wheels and one right-handed wheel or vice versa.

Cut knurling often employs automatic feed. The tooling for cut knurling resembles that for rolled knurling, with the exception that the knurls have sharp edges and are presented to the work at an angle allowing the sharp edges to cut the work. Angled, diamond and straight knurling are all supported by cut knurling. It is impossible to cut knurling &quot;Like extremely coarse pitch threads&quot; both because lathe gear trains will not support such longitudinal speeds and because reasonable cutting speeds would be impossible to achieve.

; Annular rings: Frequently used when the mating part is plastic. Rings allow for easy mating but ridges make it difficult to pull the components apart.
; Linear knurl: Used with mating plastic pieces, the linear knurl allows greater torsion between components.
; Diamond knurl: A hybrid of annular rings and linear knurling in which a diamond shape is formed. It is used to provide better grip on components, and is the most common type used on everyday objects.
; Straight knurling:

<text>Muḥammad ʿAbduh (also spelled Mohammed Abduh; ; 1849 – 11 July 1905) was an Egyptian Islamic scholar, judge, and Grand Mufti of Egypt. He was a central figure of the Arab Nahḍa and Islamic Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He began teaching advanced students esoteric Islamic texts at Al-Azhar University while he was still studying there. From 1877, with the status of &quot;ʿālim&quot;, he taught logic, theology, ethics, and politics. He was also made a professor of history at &quot;Dar al-ʿUlūm&quot; the following year, and of Arabic language and literature at &quot;Madrasat al-Alsun.&quot; ʿAbduh was a champion of the press and wrote prolifically in &quot;Al-Manār&quot; and &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;. He was made editor of &quot;Al-Waqa&#x27;i&#x27; al-Misriyya&quot; in 1880. He also authored &quot;Risālat at-Tawḥīd&quot; (; &quot;The Theology of Unity&quot;) and a commentary on the Quran. He briefly published the pan-Islamist anti-colonial newspaper &quot;al-ʿUrwa al-Wuthqā&quot; alongside his teacher and mentor Jamāl ad-Dīn al-Afghānī.

ʿAbduh joined Freemasonry and subscribed to various Masonic lodges alongside his mentor al-Afghānī and his other pupils, but eventually left the secret society in his later years. He was appointed as a judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals in 1888, a consultative member of the Court of Appeal in 1899, and he was appointed in 1899.

== Biography ==
Muḥammad ʿAbduh was born in 1849 to a father with Turkish ancestry and an Egyptian mother in the Nile Delta. His family was part of the Ottoman Egyptian elite: his father was part of the Umad, or the local ruling elite, while his mother was part of the Ashraf. He was educated in Tanta at a private school. When he turned thirteen, he was sent to the Aḥmadī mosque, which was one of the largest educational institutions in Egypt. A while later, ʿAbduh ran away from school and got married. After a brief period following his marriage, ʿAbduh returned to his school in Tanta. During this period, ʿAbduh studied under the tutelage of his Sufi Muslim uncle Dārwīsh, who was a member of the revivalist and reformist &quot;Madaniyya&quot; &quot;Tarîqâh&quot;, a popular branch of the &quot;Shadhiliyya&quot; order, spread across Egypt, Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia. Apart from spiritual exercises, the order also emphasised proper practice of Islam, shunning &quot;taqlid&quot; and stressing adherence to foundational teachings. Under the tutelage of his uncle, ʿAbduh began to practice the litany of the &quot;Madaniyya&quot;. Like many of his fellow students in Tanta, the experience would transform ʿAbduh towards Sufi asceticism with mystical orientations. Abduh would inherit many of his subsequent public views, such as firm opposition to &quot;taqlid&quot; from his Sufi uncle.
ʿAbduh suffered from acute spiritual crises in his youth, similar to those experienced by the medieval Muslim scholar and Sufi mystic al-Ghazali. He was heavily dissatisfied with the traditional education and representatives of mainstream &quot;ulama&quot; of his time. Under the influence of Shaykh Dārwīsh al-Khadīr, &quot;Tasawwuf&quot; provided an alternative form of religiosity which would profoundly shape ʿAbduh&#x27;s spiritual and intellectual formation. As ʿAbduh would subsequently emerge as a towering scholarly intellectual in Egypt, he concurrently assumed his role as a traditional Sufi Muslim. &quot;Tasawwuf&quot; as taught to ʿAbduh by Shaykh Dārwīsh transcended the perceived limitations and superficialities of traditional Islamic learning, and was based on an Islamic religiosity led by an intellectual, charismatic authority. For ʿAbduh, Shaykh Dārwīsh and his teachings represented orthodox Sufism, which was different from the Sufi folklore and the charlatans prevalent in rural Egypt during the early modern era. Explaining his conversion to Sufism under the training of Shaykh Dārwīsh, &#x27;Abduh wrote: &quot;On the seventh day, I asked the shaykh: &quot;What is your &quot;tarîqâh&quot;?&quot; He replied: &quot;Islam is my &quot;tarıqa&quot;.&quot; I asked: &quot;But are not all these people Muslims?&quot; He said: &quot;If they were Muslims, you would not see them contending over trivial matters and would not hear them swearing by God while they are lying with or without a reason.&quot; These words were like fire which burned away all that I held dear of the baggage from the past.&quot;

In 1866, ʿAbduh enrolled at al-Azhar University in Cairo, where he studied logic, Islamic philosophy, theology, and Sufism. He was a student of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, a Muslim philosopher and religious reformer who advocated Pan-Islamism to resist European colonialism. During his studies in al-Azhar, ʿAbduh had continued to express his critiques of the traditional curricuulum and traditional modes of repetition. For him, al-Afghānī combined personal charisma with a fresh intellectual approach which the &quot;ulama&quot; of al-Azhar couldn&#x27;t provide. As a young 22 year-old Sufi mystic seeking a charismatic guide and alternative modes of learning and religiosity, ʿAbduh chose al-Afghānī as his &quot;murshid&quot;. Their &quot;murid&quot;–&quot;murshid&quot; relationship would last for eight years and al-Afghānī was able to meet the expectations of his young disciple. Under al-Afghani&#x27;s influence, ʿAbduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination with Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghānī enriched ʿAbduh&#x27;s mysticism with a philosophical underpinning and thereby drew him to a rationalist interpretations of Islam. Al-Afghānī&#x27;s lessons merged his Sufi mysticism with the esoteric and theosophic tradition of Persian Shīʿīsm. He also taught ʿAbduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world, and about the technological achievements of the Western civilization.

In 1877, ʿAbduh was granted the degree of &quot;ʿālim&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot;) and he started to teach logic, Islamic theology, and ethics at al-Azhar University. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo&#x27;s teachers&#x27; training college &quot;Dar al-ʿUlūm&quot;, later incorporated into Cairo University. He was also appointed to teach Arabic at the Khedivial School of Languages. He is regarded as one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism, sometimes called &quot;Neo-Muʿtazilism&quot; after the homonymous medieval school of Islamic theology based on rationalism. ʿAbduh was also appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;al-Waqāʾiʿ al-Miṣriyya&quot;, the official newspaper of Egypt. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child&#x27;s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child&#x27;s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.

In 1879, due to his political activism, al-Afghānī was exiled and ʿAbduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms. He was exiled from Egypt by the British forces in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist ʻUrabi revolt led by Ahmed ʻUrabi in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances. ʿAbduh spent several years in Ottoman Lebanon, where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to Paris in France, where he joined al-Afghānī in publishing &quot;al-ʿUrwa al-Wuthqā&quot;, an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views. ʿAbduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of Egypt and Sudan with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in England and Tunisia, he returned to Beirut as a teacher, and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay, he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.
When he returned to Egypt in 1888, ʿAbduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge (&quot;qāḍī&quot;) in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal. In 1899, he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt, the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died. As a &quot;qāḍī&quot;, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal, such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by Non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views endeared him to the British, in particular Lord Cromer; however they also caused a rift between him and the khedive Abbas Hilmi and the nationalist leader Mustafa Kamil Pasha. While he was in Egypt, ʿAbduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences, and worked towards reforming the educational system of al-Azhar University by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum, and the working conditions for both professors and students. In 1900, he founded The Society for the Revival of Arabic Literature.

He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in Cambridge and Oxford. He studied the French law and read many great European and Arabic literary works in the libraries of Vienna and Berlin. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers. ʿAbduh died due to renal cell carcinoma in Alexandria on 11 July 1905.

==Thought==

Muḥammad ʿAbduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics; they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to ʿAbduh, a teacher&#x27;s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. His Muslim opponents accused him to be an infidel, whereas his students and followers regarded him as a sage, a reviver of Islam, and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the honorary epithets &quot;al-Ustādh al-Imām&quot; and &quot;al-Shaykh al-Muftī&quot;. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. ʿAbduh didn&#x27;t advocate for returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against polygamy if it resulted in injustice between wives, and believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement and abolish the &quot;ulama&quot; monopoly on the exegesis of the Quran and abolish racial discrimination. He described a fundamental re-interpretation of Islam as a genuine base of empowered Arab societies in the face of secular Western imperialism, and believed Islam to be the solution to political and social problems.
ʿAbduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between Sunnī and Shīʿa Muslims. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought within Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as superstitions coming from popular Sufism. His critiques to the popular cult of Muslim saints, customs of &quot;tabarruk&quot; (seeking blessings) from relics, shrine venerations, etc. were central themes in ʿAbduh&#x27;s works. He believed that practices such as supplicating and seeking intercession by placing intermediaries between God and human beings were all acts of &quot;manifest &quot;shirk&quot;&quot; (polytheism) and &quot;bidʻah&quot; (heretical innovations) unknown to the &quot;Salaf&quot;. According to ʿAbduh:
Despite his strong condemnation of excessive saint veneration, ʿAbduh was sympathetic to &quot;Tasawwuf&quot; and Ghazzalian cosmology. He would explain the philosophical and esoteric Sufi traditions of Islam in his treatise &quot;Risālat al-Wāridāt fī Sirr al-Tajalliyyat&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Mystical Inspirations from the Secrets of Revelations&quot;) which articulated the philosophical and mystical teachings of his master, Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, incorporating the spiritual ideas of medieval Sufi saints and philosophers such as Ibn Arabi and Ibn Sina. The language ʿAbduh employs to describe al-Afghānī&#x27;s instructions was based on a distinctly Sufi framework that symbolised Ishrāqi philosophy. The treatise dealt with substantiating the philosophical proofs of God&#x27;s existence and his nature, elaborating a Sufi cosmology and developed a rationalistic understanding of prophecy. ʿAbduh adhered to the cosmological doctrine of &quot;Wahdat ul-Wujud&quot; developed by mystical Islamic philosophers, which held that God and his creation are co-existent and co-eternal. Defending the doctrine of &quot;Wahdat ul-Wujud&quot; of the Sufi philosophers and saints Ibn Arabi, Suhrawardi, etc., ʿAbduh wrote:

As Christianity was the second largest religion in Egypt, ʿAbduh would devote special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many times he stood up to defend Copts, especially during the Egyptian nationalist ʻUrabi revolt led by Ahmed ʻUrabi in 1879, when some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger towards European colonialism. ʿAbduh also had meetings in Baghdad with ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, son of the founder and spiritual leader of the Baháʼí Faith, whom he had a generally positive view of—although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic Baháʼí sacred scriptures or status of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh as a Manifestation of God in the Baháʼí Faith, and mistakenly viewed it as a reformation of Shīʿīsm. ʿAbduh&#x27;s collected works have been compiled and published in five volumes by Muhammad Imarah.

== Relationship with Freemasonry ==
=== Entry into Freemasonry ===
Since the 19th century, Freemasonry and its semi-secret organizational structure provided an open forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas between Egyptians from various social-economic backgrounds in Egypt, as well as among populations of various other countries in the Muslim world, predominantly those living in the Ottoman Empire and its provinces (Lebanon, Syria, Cyprus, and Macedonia). They played an important role in early Egyptian national politics. Recognizing its potential political platform, al-Afghānī joined the Freemasons and also encouraged his disciples to join it, including ʿAbduh.

At the age of 28, ʿAbduh became a Freemason and joined a Masonic lodge, the Kawkab Al-Sharq (&quot;Planet of the East&quot;). Its members included Prince Tawfiq, the Khedive&#x27;s son and heir, leading personalities such as Muhammad Sharif Pasha, who had been a minister, Sulayman Abaza Pasha, and Saad Zaghlul. A. M. Broadbent declared that &quot;Sheikh Abdu was no dangerous fanatic or religious enthusiast, for he belonged to the broadest school of Moslem thought, held a political creed akin to pure republicanism, and was a zealous Master of a Masonic Lodge.&quot;

Over the years, ʿAbduh obtained membership in several other Masonic lodges based in Cairo and Beirut. In line with Masonic principles, ʿAbduh sought to encourage unity with all religious traditions. He stated:
He added that he was &quot;looking forward to seeing Muslims read the Torah and the Bible.&quot;

=== Withdrawal from Freemasonry ===
ʿAbduh was asked by his associate Rashid Rida, a vehement anti-Mason, regarding the reason for him and his teacher Jamal al-Din al-Afghānī joining Freemasonry. He replied that they participated in the organisation to accomplish a &quot;political and social purpose&quot;. Afghānī and his disciples, including ʿAbduh, initially viewed Masonic lodges as a vehicle for anti-colonial campaign and co-ordinate activities to depose Egyptian Khedive Ismail Pasha; enabled by the secretive nature of the lodges. But eventually, they came to the conclusion that Freemasonry itself was subordinate to European imperial powers in undermining the sovereignty of the Muslim world. Along with his mentor al-Afghānī, ʿAbduh would later withdraw from Freemasonry due to political disputes. An incident where a group of Freemasons lauded the visiting British Crown Prince sparked a serious dispute between al-Afghānī and the Freemasons; eventually causing al-Afghānī, ʿAbduh, and his disciples to quit Freemasonry. In his later years, ʿAbduh disassociated himself from Freemasonry and would deny that he ever was an active Freemason. Rashid Rida reported in the magazine &quot;al-Manār&quot; that although ʿAbduh once was a Freemason, he later &quot;cleaned himself internally from Masonry&quot;.

In his later years, ʿAbduh additionally began promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories associated with Freemasonry through the early issues of &quot;Tafsir al-Manar&quot; that were co-authored with Rashid Rida. In their commentary of the Quranic verse 4:44, ʿAbduh and Rida asserted that world Jewry were enemies of the Muslim Ummah as well as Christendom. They accused a Jewish clique of conspiring alongside Freemasons to destroy the religious culture of Europe and Islamic world by fomenting secularist revolutions and inciting Christian nations against Muslims. In response to the above publication, Egyptian nationalists and Jewish Freemasons initiated a protest movement against ʿAbduh, who was the Grand Mufti at that time. They sent numerous appeals to the Egyptian Khedive Abbas Hilmi, Consul-General Lord Cromer, and Egyptian dailies to censor ʿAbduh from publishing such tracts.

In 1903, the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II would restate and disseminate the anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic accusations formulated by ʿAbduh and Rida against the Jews and Freemasons as part of the Ottoman propaganda campaign against the nascent Zionist movement led by the Austro-Hungarian Jewish lawyer and journalist Theodor Herzl. In an article published in the &quot;al-Manār&quot; magazine in 1903, ʿAbduh and Rida further accused Freemasons of conspiring with the Jews and French colonialists of weakening the pan-Islamic spirit:

== ʿAbduh and the Baháʼí Faith ==

Like his teacher, ʿAbduh was associated with the Baháʼí Faith, which had made deliberate efforts to spread the faith to Egypt, establishing themselves in Alexandria and Cairo beginning in the late 1860s. In particular, he was in close contact with ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the eldest son of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and spiritual leader of the Baháʼí Faith from 1892 until 1921. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá would attend ʿAbduh&#x27;s study sessions. The two men met at a time when they had similar goals of religious reform and were in opposition to the Ottoman &quot;ulama&quot;. Regarding the meetings of `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Muhammad ʿAbduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that &quot;His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad &#x27;Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.&quot; Remarking on `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s excellence in religious science and diplomacy, ʿAbduh said of him that &quot;[he] is more than that. Indeed, he is a great man; he is the man who deserves to have the epithet applied to him.&quot;

<text>[[Consumer Technology Association|CTA]]-708 (formerly EIA-708 and CEA-708) is the standard for closed captioning for ATSC digital television (DTV) viewing in the United States and Canada. It was developed by the Consumer Electronics sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance, which became Consumer Technology Association.

Unlike Run-length encoding DVB and DVD subtitles, CTA-708 captions are low bandwidth and textual like traditional EIA-608 captions and EBU Teletext subtitles. Unlike EIA-608 byte pairs, CTA-708 captions are not able to be modulated on an ATSC receiver&#x27;s composite output and must be pre-rendered by the receiver. With the digital video frames, they also include more of the Latin-1 character set, and include stubs to support full UTF-32 captions, and downloadable fonts. CTA-708 caption streams can also encapsulate EIA-608 byte pairs internally, a fairly common usage.

CTA-708 captions are used in MPEG-2 video streams in the picture user data. The packets are in picture order and must be rearranged. This is known as the DTVCC Transport Stream. It is a fixed-bandwidth channel that has 960 bit/s typically allocated for backward compatible &quot;encapsulated&quot; Line 21 captions, and 1.08 kB/s allocated for CTA-708 captions, for a total of 1.2 kB/s. The ATSC A/53 Standard contains the encoding specifics. The main form of signalling is via a PSIP caption descriptor which indicates the language of each caption and if formatted for &quot;easy reader&quot; (3rd-grade level for language learners) in the PSIP EIT on a per-event basis and optionally in the H.222 PMT only if the video always sends caption data.

CTA-708 caption decoders are required in the U.S. by FCC regulation in all diagonal or larger digital televisions. Further, some broadcasters are required by FCC regulations to caption a percentage of their broadcasts.

== CTA-708 Technical Details ==
Caption streams are transmitted with many packet wrappers around them. These are the picture user data, which contains the caption data, which contains the cc_data, which contains the Caption Channel packets, which contains the Service Block, which contains the caption streams. 

This layering is based on the OSI Protocol Reference Model:
=== Picture User Data ===
These are inserted before a SMPTE 259M active video frame or video packet. Common video packets are a picture header, a picture parameter set, and a Material Exchange Format essence.

This structure was designed for any digital audio or metadata that is to be synchronized with a video frame. SDI transports every eight bits in a 10-bit aligned packet and the ancillary flag bytes are replaced by 128 bit header. 

A cdp_timecode is used when cdp data stream is discontinuous (i.e., not padded) and the cdp_service_info is used to add extra details to the PSIP broadcast metadata such as language code, easy reader, and widescreen usage.

=== Fonts ===

CTA-708 supports eight font tags: undefined, monospaced serif, proportional serif, monospaced sans serif, proportional sans serif, casual, cursive, and small capitals. Below are some font examples, for more see the Wikipedia Fonts article.

<text>Amy Moritz Ridenour (November 9, 1959 – March 31, 2017) was president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, DC conservative think tank. Ridenour held this post from the organization&#x27;s founding in 1982 until her death. She wrote a syndicated op-ed column from 1997 and was a frequent radio and television guest.

==Background==

According to Nina Easton&#x27;s &quot;Gang of Five&quot;, Amy Moritz was a veteran organizer of the College Republican National Committee. She was a candidate in 1981 for election as national chairman of the organization, opposed by Jack Abramoff.

Abramoff, Ralph Reed, and Grover Norquist persuaded Moritz to drop out of the race by promising her the appointed position of executive director. With the only serious competitor out of the way, Abramoff won the election easily.

Although Moritz was later rebuffed by the &quot;Abramoff-Norquist-Reed triumvirate&quot; and only given the titular position of &quot;deputy director&quot;, she continued to work with the group and became a good friend of Norquist. Abramoff would also later become a director of the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR).

Moritz later married fellow College Republican David A. Ridenour.

==National Center for Public Policy Research==
Ridenour was a founding chief executive officer of the NCPPR in 1982. The NCPPR claims to promote &quot;the conservative and free market perspective on US domestic, foreign and defense policy issues.&quot; Ridenour&#x27;s husband David A. Ridenour is vice president of the organization.

NCPPR bulletins have been heavily cited by conservative members of Congress, sometimes apparently being copied entirely with little more than a change in letterhead.

==Pro-tobacco, anti-environmental positions==

During the national tobacco litigation, a memo from Philip Morris executive Frank Gomez revealed that Ridenour (under her maiden name of Amy Moritz) had offered &quot;to use any information we can provide re the current anti-tobacco onslaught...&quot; Ridenour wrote many op-eds attacking the filing of lawsuits by state attorneys general against tobacco firms and on tobacco policies, such as &quot;Ironies of the Tobacco Wars,&quot; &quot;Federal Tobacco Lawsuit Could Pave Way for Litigation Tax on Other Industries,&quot; &quot;Latin America Go Home: Tobacco Policies in Foreign Countries Should Be Made by Foreign Countries, Not in U.S. Courts&quot; and &quot;Lawyers&#x27; Fees in Tobacco Case Should Be Capped.&quot; Ridenour said that such lawsuits were improper, that regulation of tobacco was the province of legislatures, not law enforcement, and that private attorneys were using the suits to enrich themselves by many millions of dollars.

Environmentalists also claimed articles by Ridenour skeptical of the global warming theory were written only because NCPPR received support from ExxonMobil. Ridenour, writing on her blog, countered that her writing on the issue began in 1992, predating by many years her institution&#x27;s receipt of any funding from fossil fuel industries. She also claimed that total fossil fuel funding of NCPPR in 2004 amounted to six-tenths of one percent of her organization&#x27;s total funding. An examination of ExxonMobil grant reports in 2011 on the ExxonMobil website showed NCPPR had not received any grants from ExxonMobil for at least several years.

==Abramoff connections==

===Support for Abramoff clients===
In a series of editorials between 1999 and 2001, Ridenour attacked efforts to expand federal immigration laws to the Commonwealth of the Marianas Islands, defended the islands&#x27; meager wages, and attacked Clinton Administration attempts to tighten labor laws. Ridenour also lent her support to the Western Pacific Economic Council, a trade group composed of Marianas garment manufacturers. Her group’s name appeared in a Saipan newspaper backing the Council in 1999.

Both the Marianas and the Economic Council were clients of Jack Abramoff at the time. The Marianas paid Abramoff’s firm Preston Gates $1.9 million in 1999 and 2000 and his second firm, Greenberg Traurig, $1.1 million in 2001. The Western Pacific Economic Council paid Preston Gates $2.3 million in 1999 and 2000.

In August 2001, Ridenour wrote an editorial in the Washington Times, &quot;The U.S. Must Tread Carefully to Avoid Creating More Fundamentalist Islamic Governments,&quot; warning of the dangerous possibility that Malaysia could become a third Iran or Afghanistan, with what she called &quot;ferocious and fanatical hatred aimed against the West generally and the United States in particular&quot; and in the case of Afghanistan sheltering &quot;the world&#x27;s most notorious - and dangerous - international terrorist, Osama bin Laden.&quot; She warned about Islamic fundamentalist support for Anwar Ibrahim, the main political rival of Abramoff’s then-client, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Of Malaysia, she wrote, &quot;in recent years Malaysia has made extraordinary strides in its development as a prosperous, stable and democratic state&quot; but &quot;its levels of economic freedom, regulations on trade and limits on private property rights led the Heritage Foundation to conclude in 2001 that its economy is &#x27;mostly unfree.&#x27;&quot; Abramoff was paid $1.2 million to arrange a meeting between the Prime Minister and President Bush.

===Funding of Abramoff-sponsored trips===
Ridenour has come under fire for allegedly using the NCPPR as a clearinghouse for clients of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff to pay for a luxurious golf trip to St. Andrew&#x27;s in Scotland, attended by congressman Tom DeLay and others. Ridenour was called to testify on this matter before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on June 22, 2005.

Records showed that Abramoff directed one of his clients to donate to the NCPPR; the NCPPR then paid an equivalent amount to provide most of the funding for the golf trip, which was described in required House filing paperwork as for &quot;educational purposes&quot;. Two months after the trip, DeLay voted against legislation opposed by the client. DeLay and Ridenour have both defended the propriety of the arrangement, asserting that the donation was in no way connected to the trip, nor were the donation or the trip connected to the vote.

DeLay was admonished three times last year by the House ethics committee for infringing rules governing lawmakers&#x27; activities and their contacts with registered lobbyists. House ethics rules bar the payment by lobbyists for any lawmaker&#x27;s travel-connected entertainment and recreational activities costing more than $50; they also require that lawmakers accurately report the sponsor of their trips and the full cost.

In an article last month about the same trip by DeLay, The Post reported that an Indian tribe and a gambling services company made donations to the National Center for Public Policy Research that covered most of the expenses declared by participants at that time. The article also said these payments were made two months before DeLay voted against legislation opposed by the tribe and the company. DeLay has said the vote was unrelated to the payments.

The article also reported that Abramoff submitted an expense voucher to Preston Gates seeking a reimbursement of $12,789.73 to cover expenses for meals, hotels and transportation during the London and Scotland trip incurred by DeLay; his wife, Christine; and his two aides.

The new receipts add more detail about these expenses, make clear that the total expenses for all of the participants were at least $50,000 more than was previously known, and connect Abramoff directly to the payment of some charges.

Ridenour also attended the 1997 DeLay-Abramoff trip to Russia funded through NCPPR by the Russian energy giant Naftasib.

<text>Sartor Resartus: The Life and Opinions of Herr Teufelsdröckh in Three Books is a novel by the Scottish essayist, historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle, first published as a serial in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in November 1833 – August 1834. The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (which translates as &#x27;God-born Devil&#x27;s-dung&#x27;), author of a tome entitled &quot;Clothes: Their Origin and Influence&quot;. Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a sceptical English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German Idealism more generally.

==Background==

Archibald MacMechan surmised that the novel&#x27;s invention had three literary sources. The first of these was &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; by Jonathan Swift, whom Carlyle intensely admired in his college years, even going by the nicknames &quot;Jonathan&quot; and &quot;The Dean&quot;. In that work, the three main traditions of Western Christianity are represented by a father bestowing his three children with clothes they may never alter, but proceed to do so according to fashion. Carlyle&#x27;s second influence, according to MacMechan, was his own work in translating Goethe, particularly &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, and &quot;Faust&quot;, all of which Carlyle quotes and explicitly refers to, especially when Teufelsdröckh names his own crisis &quot;The Sorrows of Young Teufelsdröckh&quot;. The third major influence was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and to which he referred in earlier letters.
Carlyle worked on an earlier novel, Wotton Reinfred, which MacMechan refers to as &quot;[t]he first draft of &quot;Sartor&quot;.&quot; Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert, who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses speculative philosophy with him. At this point, the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around Kant. Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle&#x27;s wife Jane, (née Welsh) Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle&#x27;s death. MacMechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle&#x27;s frustration and scorn due to the &quot;zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction&quot; he speaks of in his letters of the time. Numerous parts of &quot;Wotton&quot; appear in the biographical section of &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, where Carlyle humorously turns them into Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains are overly fragmented or derivative of Goethe. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form; several passages were moved verbatim to &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, but with their context radically changed.

Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel, and he began composing it as an article in October 1831 at Craigenputtock. &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; serialised it in 1833–1834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson&#x27;s savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation, which the novel did not attain in Britain. The first British edition would be published in London in 1838.

== Title ==
&quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; is usually translated as &quot;The Tailor Re-tailored&quot;; it has also been rendered as &quot;The Tailor Repatched&quot;, &quot;The Tailor Patched&quot;, &quot;The Clothes Volume Edited&quot;, and as &quot;The Tailor Made Whole Again&quot;.

There is a song called &quot;The Taylor Done Over&quot; which was published in London in 1785. It has been suggested that a Scottish variant was popular in Carlyle&#x27;s day and may have inspired his choice of title. Another source might have been Lord Byron&#x27;s play &quot;The Deformed Transformed&quot; (1824). The play, based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, was admired by Goethe, who was a friend and mentor of Carlyle&#x27;s, and Carlyle referenced Byron in his writings from the late 1820s.

==Plot==

The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English publication &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (in which the novel was first serialised without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is, upon request, reviewing the fictional German book &quot;Clothes, Their Origin and Influence&quot; by the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (Professor of &quot;Things in General&quot; at Weissnichtwo - i.e. &quot;Know-not-where&quot; - University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing as well, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdröckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book&#x27;s philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests back to Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s office in Germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor&#x27;s many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations from Goethe and Shakespeare. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor&#x27;s frustration at the philosophy, and his desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received a reply from Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organised according to the signs of the Latin Zodiac) on which are written autobiographical fragments.
At the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organised the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdröckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl (&quot;Duck-Pond&quot;); his father a retired sergeant of Frederick the Great and his mother a very pious woman, who to Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdröckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdröckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (slap-behind) Gymnasium. While there, Teufelsdröckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent: glad for his education, but critical of that education&#x27;s disregard for actual human activity and character, as regarding both his own treatment and his education&#x27;s application to politics. While at University, Teufelsdröckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post and some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdröckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (Goddess of Flowers; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdröckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, and leaves the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated Everlasting No, disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdröckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a &quot;Centre of Indifference&quot;, and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in &quot;The Everlasting Yea&quot;. The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy.

===Characters===

Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh: (Greek/German: &quot;God-Born Devil-Dung&quot;) The Professor of &quot;Things in General&quot; at Weissnichtwo University, and writer of a long book of German idealist philosophy called &quot;Clothes, Their Origin and Influence&quot;, the review of which forms the contents of the novel. Both professor and book are fictional.

The Editor: The narrator of the novel, who in reviewing Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s book, reveals much about his own tastes, as well as deep sympathy towards Teufelsdröckh, and much worry as to social issues of his day. His tone varies between conversational, condemning and even semi-Biblical prophecy. The Reviewer should not be confused with Carlyle himself, seeing as much of Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s life implements Carlyle&#x27;s own biography.

Hofrath: Hofrath Heuschrecke (i. e. State-Councillor Grasshopper) is a loose, zigzag figure, a blind admirer of Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s, an incarnation of distraction distracted, and the only one who advises the editor and encourages him in his work; a victim to timidity and preyed on by an uncomfortable sense of mere physical cold, such as the majority of the state-counsellors of the day were.

Blumine: A woman associated to the German nobility with whom Teufelsdröckh falls in love early in his career. Her spurning of him to marry Towgood leads Teufelsdröckh to the spiritual crisis that culminates in the Everlasting No. Their relationship is somewhat parodic of Werther&#x27;s spurned love for Lotte in &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; (including her name &quot;Goddess of Flowers&quot;, which may simply be a pseudonym), though, as the Editor notes, Teufelsdröckh does not take as much incentive as does Werther. Critics have associated her with Kitty Kirkpatrick, with whom Carlyle himself fell in love before marrying Jane Carlyle.

Towgood: The English aristocrat who ultimately marries Blumine, throwing Teufelsdröckh into a spiritual crisis. If Blumine is indeed a fictionalization of Kitty Kirkpatrick, Towgood would find his original in Captain James Winslowe Phillipps, who married Kirkpatrick in 1829.

===Locales===

Dumdrudge: Dumdrudge is an imaginary village where the natives drudge away and say nothing about it, as villagers all over the world contentedly do.

&quot;Weissnichtwo&quot;: In the book, Weissnichtwo (&quot;weiß-nicht-wo&quot;, German for &quot;don&#x27;t-know-where&quot;) is an imaginary European city, viewed as the focus, and as exhibiting the operation, of all the influences for good and evil of the time, described in terms which characterised city life in the first quarter of the 19th century; so universal appeared the spiritual forces at work in society at that time that it was impossible to say where they were and where they were not, and hence the name of the city, &quot;Don&#x27;t-know-where&quot; (cf. Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kennaquhair&quot;).

==Themes==
&quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where &quot;truth&quot; is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, to which it refers. The imaginary &quot;Philosophy of Clothes&quot; holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over time, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith-systems. The book contains a very Fichtean conception of religious conversion: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to see &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; as an early existentialist text.

One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s publisher being named Stillschweigen and Co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s father is introduced as an earnest believer in Walter Shandy&#x27;s doctrine that &quot;there is much, nay almost all in Names.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
James Fraser complained to Carlyle that its initial serial publication had been received negatively in many quarters. The most substantive early treatment came in the form of an 1835 letter to Carlyle from his friend John Sterling. Sterling compared it to François Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, Laurence Sterne and Jonathan Swift, while taking issue with Carlyle&#x27;s style and what he perceived as Teufelsdröckh&#x27;s pantheism.

&quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; was best received in America, where Carlyle became a dominant cultural influence and a perceived leader of the Transcendental Movement. In 1834, Harriet Martineau, visiting from England, observed its effect: &quot;The book is acting upon them with wonderful force. It has regenerated the preaching of more than one of the clergy; and, I have reason to believe, the minds and lives of several of the laity.&quot; After its 1836 arrival in Boston as a book, Nathaniel Langdon Frothingham accurately predicted that reaction would be divided between those that found it vapid and convoluted and those that found it insightful and philosophically fruitful. James Russell Lowell regarded the book as &quot;the signal for a sudden mental and moral mutiny&quot;. 

=== Influence ===

In 1855, George Eliot wrote of Carlyle:The character of his influence is best seen in the fact that many of the men who have the least agreement with his opinions are those to whom the reading of &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; was an epoch in the history of their minds.According to Rodger L. Tarr, &quot;The influence of &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; upon American Literature is so vast, so pervasive, that it is difficult to overstate.&quot; Tarr notes its influence on such leading American writers as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Margaret Fuller, Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain (Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe were among those that read and objected to the book). Andrew Preston Peabody wrote in 1860 that &quot;Carlyle first took a strong hold on the cultivated mind of America by his &#x27;Sartor Resartus,&#x27;—a work more full of seed-thoughts than any single volume of the present century,&quot; adding that the following publication of the &quot;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays&quot; &quot;was in almost every one&#x27;s hands.&quot; Charles Godfrey Leland wrote that he &quot;read it through forty times ere I left college, of which I &#x27;kept count.&#x27;&quot; William Henry Milburn wrote that he &quot;was as familiar with the everlasting Nay, the Centre of Indifference, and the everlasting Yea, as with the side walk in front of my house.&quot;

Keir Hardie recalled reading the book as a teenager until &quot;the spirit of it somewhat entered into me&quot;. His encounter with Carlyle became one of the most enduring influences of his life, shaping his radicalism and pacifism.

Jorge Luis Borges greatly admired the book, recounting that in 1916 at age 17 &quot;[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.&quot; Many of Borges&#x27; first characteristic and most admired works employ the same technique of intentional pseudepigraphy as Carlyle, such as &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; and &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;.

Paul Gauguin painted the book in his portrait of Meyer de Haan, who had imported the book into Pont-Aven. Maurice Maeterlinck valued Carlyle&#x27;s ideas on silence. Claude Debussy called the book &quot;that cruel breviary of humor&quot; and imagined a missing chapter, &quot;The Relationship of the Hat to Music.&quot;

Martin Luther King Jr. paraphrased a line from book 2, chapter 7, paragraph 4 of &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; in a sermon delivered in 1957: &quot;In our moments of despair, some of us find ourselves crying out with the earnest belief of Carlyle, &quot;It seems that God sits in His heaven and does nothing.&quot;

The novel has been identified as containing the first appearance in English of the proverb &quot;Speech is silver, silence is golden&quot;, as well as the first English use of the expression &quot;meaning of life.&quot;

Scottish literary critic Alastair Fowler used the book as an example of his term &quot;poioumenon&quot;, a work that addresses the process of its own creation.

The book is increasingly recognized as &quot;the founding text for the emergence of the serious and organized study of clothing&quot;, otherwise termed &quot;dress studies&quot; or &quot;fashion theory&quot;.

<text>William Duncan Strong (1899–1962) was an American archaeologist and anthropologist noted for his application of the direct historical approach to the study of indigenous peoples of North and South America.

==Early life and education==
Strong was born in Portland, Oregon.

He initially studied zoology, but he changed his focus to anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, under the influence of Alfred L. Kroeber, who became his &quot;principal teacher, mentor, and friend&quot;. Strong completed his doctorate in 1926.

==Career==
Strong&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, &quot;An Analysis of Southwestern Society&quot;, was published in &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;. A related study of his, &quot;Aboriginal Society in Southern California&quot;, presenting his detailed fieldwork among the Serrano, Luiseño, Cupeño, and Cahuilla peoples, has been characterized as &quot;one of the earliest and one of the best efforts by a United States anthropologist to combine structural-functional analysis with historical data and interpretation&quot;. Strong also conducted ethnographic field research among the Naskapi of Labrador.

Most of Strong&#x27;s anthropological contributions were specifically in archaeology. His 1935 study, &quot;An Introduction to Nebraska Archaeology&quot;, is credited with providing a major impetus for the direct historical approach in archaeology.

In the 1930s, Strong, Waldo Rudolph Wedel and A. T. Hill found archaeological evidence in Nebraska different from the prehistoric Central Plains and Woodland traditions. The evidence was attributed to a new culture called the Dismal River culture, or Dismal River aspect, for its location on the Dismal River basin of Nebraska, dated between 1650-1750.

Strong performed pioneering fieldwork in California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley, the Pacific Northwest, the American Great Plains, Labrador, and Honduras, where he sought the legendary La Ciudad Blanca. In Peru, he developed statistical methods to seriate pottery styles and is credited with the discovery of the tomb of the war god Ai apaec in 1946.

Strong held academic positions at the University of Nebraska and Columbia University. Among his notable students were the archaeologists Waldo Wedel and Gordon Willey.

<text>Iorwith Wilbur Abel (August 11, 1908 – August 10, 1987), better known as I. W. Abel, was an American labor leader.

==Early life and career==
Abel was born in Magnolia, Ohio, in 1908, to John Franklin Abel, a German blacksmith, and Mary Ann (née Jones) Abel, the daughter of a Welsh coal miner. He attended local public school and graduated from Magnolia High School in 1925.

He attended college at Canton Actual Business College in Canton, Ohio, but he did not graduate.

In 1925, he worked as a molder for the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company (now U.S. Steel) in Canton. He switched jobs often and found employment at the Canton Malleable Iron Company, the Timken Roller Bearing Company and the Colonial Foundry.

Abel married Bernice Joseph in 1930. The couple had two children. She died in 1982, and Abel married Martha Turvey a few years later.

Laid off during the Great Depression, Abel worked at a brickmaking company loading a kiln at less than a quarter his former pay. Convinced that a union would have protected him from losing his job, he became active in the American labor movement.

==Union career==
In 1936, Abel found work again at Timken Roller Bearing and, with the assistance of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), he organized Steel Workers Local 1123. He remained a member of the local until his death. He proved an effective and strong negotiator and union president, and in one year alone, he led 42 wildcat strikes.

Abel was an active participant in the Little Steel Strike in 1937. His skilled leadership during the strike brought him to the attention of national SWOC officers and staff.

In 1937, Abel was hired by SWOC head the national union&#x27;s organizing staff. Abel became a protégé of Philip Murray, president of SWOC. When SWOC merged with the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers in 1942, to form the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), Abel was appointed director of the Canton District of the USWA and became a member of the executive council of the Ohio CIO Council.

During World War II, Abel served on the National War Labor Board, representing the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

===Challenging McDonald===
Murray died in 1952. USWA secretary-treasurer David J. McDonald was elected president as his successor, and Abel was elected secretary-treasurer. Unlike the flamboyant and vocal McDonald, Abel remained in the background as the union&#x27;s secretary-treasurer. He was appointed to the CIO-PAC, the CIO&#x27;s political action committee. He spent most of his time visiting local unions and listening to members.

In the early 1960s, Abel was angered by what he perceived as McDonald&#x27;s weakness in winning new national contracts for steelworkers. When McDonald altered the union&#x27;s constitution to permit him to serve two more four-year terms, Abel decided to challenge McDonald in the 1965 presidential election. Abel accused McDonald of being too cozy with employers by substituting fringe benefit gains for wage increases and ignoring members&#x27; concerns. The election took place on February 9, 1965. Voting irregularities and challenged ballots delayed a final result until April 30. Abel relied heavily on voting and ballot-challenging procedures established under the relatively new Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (or &quot;Landrum-Griffin Act&quot;). Without the assistance of the new law, it is unclear that he would have won.

However, union officials and federal monitors eventually declared Abel the winner by a razor-thin margin of 10,142 votes, out of 600,678 cast, and on May 20, McDonald declined to challenge the result. Over 7,000 of the votes came from Canadian locals, and Abel spent a greater amount of time than had any of his predecessors protecting the interests of Canadian steelworkers locals. Abel was sworn in as USWA president on June 2, 1965.

===President of USWA===
Abel was elected a vice president of the AFL-CIO following his election and served on the federation&#x27;s executive council. In 1968, he was elected president of the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO.

During Abel&#x27;s presidency, membership in the USWA rose by more than 500,000, as he engineered mergers with the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers in 1967; the United Stone and Allied Product Workers of America in 1971; and the International Union of District 50, Allied and Technical Workers of the United States and Canada in 1972.

Abel also broadened the union&#x27;s inclusiveness. He encouraged open discussion of controversial issues among the staff and membership and decentralized a number of union functions. He also worked to increase minority participation in local, regional and national union affairs and to end job discrimination by local steelworker unions.

His reforms were not enough. Workers sued the union for race and sex discrimination numerous times in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, Abel was forced to sign a consent decree to alter seniority rules that discriminated against women and minority workers.

Abel actively sought new federal laws to protect union workers as well. He was a vigorous proponent of workplace health and safety and worked to help pass the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970. He was also a strong advocate of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which protected the interests of participants in private pension plans and established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Abel also won several strong national steel and other metals contracts. He established the union&#x27;s first strike fund and quickly amassed an $85 million balance. He resumed coordinated bargaining with the major steelmakers and established separate bargaining councils for aluminum and other metals industries.

In 1971, record imports of foreign steel led to 108,000 steelworkers being laid off. Although a new national steel contract was reached without a strike the same year, Abel and the USWA executive council realized that the steel industry&#x27;s tendency to stockpile steel in anticipation of a strike led to a boom-and-bust cycle, which hurt workers.

To counteract the cycle, in 1973 Abel negotiated the Experimental Negotiating Agreement (ENA) with the major steelmakers. Abel agreed not to strike during the 1974 contract talks and agreed to binding arbitration for any bargaining issues that led to impasse.

The ENA proved a great success during the 1974 national steel contract talks. Abel won a $2.00 an hour raise over three years. The union also won the right to engage in local strikes over noneconomic working conditions, which the union had agreed to ban in previous contracts.

The ENA contributed to a second round of successful contract talks in 1977, but employers unilaterally withdrew from the pact in 1980 after the steel industry recession of 1979.

On January 11, 1977, Abel was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford.

===Other roles===
In 1967, he was appointed an alternate representative of the US delegation to the United Nations.

Abel&#x27;s strong advocacy of the rights of minorities within the union led him to be appointed in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson to the Kerner Commission, which was created to investigate the rioting that had occurred that year in Black neighborhoods in more than 150 cities.

In 1971, Abel was appointed to the Economic Stabilization Program, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s wage and price restraint board. He resigned in 1972 over the program&#x27;s decision for strict limits to wage increases for workers.

===Internal opposition===
Various union leaders and members began to criticize Abel after the 1977 contract. Despite Abel&#x27;s successes at the bargaining table, steelmakers continued to cut back production, and union membership sank by 650,000. Also, older union members were angry over the 1974 consent decree, which had stripped them of their seniority.

One Abel&#x27;s most prominent critics was Edward Sadlowski, the director of District 31, then the union&#x27;s largest district. Sadlowski, a member of the union&#x27;s Rank and File Caucus, had mounted an insurgent campaign for the post of director of District 31 in 1973. Although he was unsuccessful, he sued to have the election overturned on the grounds that it violated the fair election procedures of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.

The election was rerun, with Sadlowski winning in 1974. Sadlowski was widely considered to be a challenger to Abel in the 1977 presidential election.

===Retirement===
However, Abel had announced his retirement instead. An Abel protégé, Lloyd McBride, the director of District 34, ran as Abel&#x27;s successor. Sadlowski ran for the presidency. Abel spent a significant amount of time campaigning for McBride. The election was a bitter one, but McBride won.

After his retirement, Abel moved to Sun City, Arizona. In 1984, he and his new wife moved to Malvern, Ohio.

==Death==

Abel died of cancer at his home in Malvern in 1987; he would have turned 79 one day later.

<doc id="1149737" wikidata="Q1605324" url="?curid=1149737" title="Hen and chicks">
<text>Hen and chicks (also known as hen-and-chickens, or hen-widdies in the southern United States) is a common name for a group of small succulent plants. They belong to the flowering plant family Crassulaceae, native to southern Europe and northern Africa. The plants grow close to the ground with leaves formed around each other in a rosette, and propagating by offsets. The &quot;hen&quot; is the main, or mother, plant, and the &quot;chicks&quot; are a flock of offspring, which start as tiny buds on the main plant and soon sprout their own roots, taking up residence close to the mother plant.

Plants commonly referred to as &quot;Hens and chicks&quot; include ground-hugging species of &quot;Sempervivum&quot; (houseleeks) such as &quot;Sempervivum&quot; &#x27;Pekinese&#x27;, &quot;S. arachnoideum&quot; (cobweb houseleek), and &quot;S. tectorum&quot; (common houseleek), as well as members of the related genus &quot;Jovibarba&quot;. The name is also used for some species of &quot;Echeveria&quot;, &quot;Sedum&quot; and &quot;Bergenia&quot; although these plants differ significantly from &quot;Sempervivum&quot; and &quot;Jovibarba&quot;, and may require different cultivation and care.

==Care==
Hen and chicks is popular in gardens for its varied and interesting appearance and hardiness. It is grown as container planting or in rock gardens. It does best in well-drained, rocky soil; if they are kept wet, the outer leaves will rot. Planting them in cactus or succulent soil will prevent your plant from sitting in water and meeting an untimely end. Commercial succulent soil is a good choice. Using a pot that allows for drainage at the bottom will also aid in circulating the moisture, and keep the water from sitting at the bottom (this will prevent root rot). Although it does best in sun, it will grow in light shade.

==Medicinal uses==
The leaves of hens and chicks have been used as herbal remedies for many years. Freshly pressed leaves may act as a substitute to aloe vera for wounds such as low severity burns, sores, and insect bites. Extracts from leaves have been shown to have some antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Higher levels of antioxidant compounds are produced after long term stressors such as soil drought.

<doc id="1149740" wikidata="Q15266153" url="?curid=1149740" title="John Abel (carpenter)">
<text>John Abel (1578/79 – January 1675) was an English carpenter and mason, granted the title of &#x27;King&#x27;s Carpenter&#x27;, who was responsible for several notable structures in the ornamented Half-timbered construction typical of the West Midlands.

John Abel was born in Sarnesfield, Herefordshire. He was a Catholic recusant, along with his wife Johanna. In 1618 he was brought before a church court to answer for his recusancy and also for his secret marriage to Johanna. The case against him was eventually dismissed, but his name can be found on a list of Catholic recusants from 1640.

Abel married twice, but there is no record of his second wife except on his table tomb in Sarnesfield. He had one son, named John, who later became churchwarden of Sarnesfield.

==Work==
Very little is known about Abel&#x27;s work, and some local traditions attribute buildings to him that are impossible in terms of their date. Abel&#x27;s first known commission was in 1625 when he was contracted to build Lady Hawkins&#x27; grammar school in Kington. The contract was to fit into the terms of the will of Lady Margaret Hawkins. It is known that Abel supplied all the materials and that he was paid £240. The house design differs significantly from his later work in that it was built partially of stone. The stone window and ceiling beams of the house still survive, though the rest of the building was demolished.

In March 1633, it is known that Abel was contracted again, this time by John, 1st Viscount Scudamore, to renovate Abbey Dore Church, a former Cistercian monastery in Herefordshire. The work was completed in March 1634, in time for the reconsecration of the building. Though there have been some minor alterations made to his work, the church remains the most intact example of Abel&#x27;s work available today as well as one of the best preserved examples of Laudian architecture.

There is no record of Abel&#x27;s work for another eighteen years, until in 1652, he was contracted to create a new building for which he was paid £30. &#x27;The modell of ye New Building&#x27; still exists and is currently kept at Tyberton Court, where the work was originally done.

Abel is also known to have built market houses in Brecnoc (1624), Kington and Lemster (1634). The Lemster (now Leominster) market house originally stood in Broad Street, but was rebuilt by John Arkwright who bought the building for £95. He offered the building to the council if they would re-erect it but they refused. He moved the building himself and rebuilt it in 1856. It remained as a private house until the 1930s, was subsequently used as council offices, and following extension work it reopened as a visitor attraction, cafe, community space, wedding venue and offices. It is widely regarded as one of Abel&#x27;s finest works and is built in the Renaissance tradition. It is now known as Grange Court. In 2001, a campaign was started to raise money to restore the building to its original state. The building is Grade II listed.

The Kington market hall was demolished in 1820 and no record of its appearance remains.

All of Abel&#x27;s market houses are known to have been built in timber and were known to contain lengthy religious inscriptions in their walls, some borrowing from both St Jerome and Cato the Elder. Some of these inscriptions can also be found on his work at Dore Abbey. In spite of the intricacies of his work, Abel&#x27;s style has still been described as &#x27;restrained&#x27;.

Based on the consistency of Abel&#x27;s style, scholars tentatively attribute the restoration of Vowchurch in 1613 and Monnington Court on the Wye to him.

===Military work===
In 1645, during the middle of the civil war, Abel was in Hereford when the Scots besieged it. With Charles I and his soldiers inside the city walls, mills were important to ensure the food supply lasted, and powder mills to make gunpowder. The Roundheads had burnt down the mills the town had previously owned. However, Abel was able to design and build another one. Records differ but because of this the King granted Abel the title of either Master Carpenter or the King&#x27;s Carpenter.

Sir Barnabus Scudamore went further in his estimation of Abel, saying that he was the only man in England who was able to create powder mills.

Abel is also known to have created a wooden tank called the Sow which Scudmore deployed against the parliamentary garrison at Canon Frome in October 1645. Unfortunately the device was never used in combat as it was surprised by Parliamentarian raiders.

==Myths==
Abel is frequently connected to the Hereford Market Hall (which was partially demolished in 1862), though historical evidence suggests that the building was not created by him. In 2008, English Heritage&#x27;s Inspector of Historic Buildings, Nick Molyneux, was noted as saying that the style of the architecture was different from Abel&#x27;s.

Though historical records clearly show otherwise, legend states that Abel found, felled and used all the timber used in Dore Abbey Church in less than five months.

In spite of a lack of evidence that he had a hand in the architecture, John Abel was associated with buildings in: Weobley, Abbey Dore, Tyberton, Stretford, Orleton, Pembridge, Ross-on-Wye, Ledbury and Hereford.

==Death==
Abel died in January 1675 and was buried at Sarnesfield on 31 January. He was 97 years old. He wrote his own epitaph and built his own tomb. His tombstone read:
In the Victorian era, the tomb was restored by the National Society for Preserving the Memorials of the Dead and the epitaph was slightly altered. In 2001 a campaign was started to restore Abel&#x27;s tomb.

<text>John Jacob Abel (19 May 1857 – 26 May 1938) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist. He established the pharmacology department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1893, and then became America&#x27;s first full-time professor of pharmacology. During his time at Hopkins, he made several important medical advancements, especially in the field of hormone extraction. In addition to his laboratory work, he founded several significant scientific journals such as the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics&quot;.

==Early life and education==

John Jacob Abel was born in 1857 near Cleveland, Ohio, to German immigrants George M. and Mary (Becker) Abel. He earned his Ph.B. (Bachelor of Philosophy) from the University of Michigan where he studied under Henry Sewall in 1883. But, during this time he took several years off to serve as a principal of the high school in La Porte, Indiana. There he taught many subjects ranging from chemistry and physics to Latin. He then went to Johns Hopkins University, where he studied under Henry Newell Martin, a cardiac physiologist and professor of biology. He then left for Europe, starting in Leipzig studying medical sciences, then traveling to Strasbourg where he was about to receive his Ph.D., but instead decided to receive an M.D. in 1888 from the University of Strasbourg.

After his doctorate, Abel worked mostly in clinical studies and took clinical courses, focusing on biochemistry and pharmacology. He traveled around Europe, mostly in Germany and central Europe, conducting research in biochemistry. During this time, Abel had a number of mentors that inspired his work and exposed him to a number of disciplines that eventually prompted him to work in biochemistry and pharmacology. Starting in 1884, Abel worked with doctors Ludwig von Frey in physiology and histology, Rudolf Boehm in pharmacology, Adolph Strümpell in pathology, and Johannes Wislicenus in organic and inorganic chemistry. All of this work was done in Leipzig until 1886, until Abel moved on to Strasbourg, where he again worked in various fields: internal medicine with Adolph Kussmaul, and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in infectious disease and pathology. Eventually, Abel moved back to Strasbourg where he worked more with Oswald Schmiedeberg among others. Schmeidberg, however, sparked his interest in pharmacological research. Lastly, he worked in a biochemical laboratory in Berne, where he met one Arthur Robertson Cushny, who eventually worked with him at Michigan.

==Career==
Finishing his time in Europe, Abel returned to the University of Michigan as the chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics. There, he played an important role in developing the first pharmacology department in North America. He only was at the University of Michigan until 1893, when William Osler of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine asked Abel to come to the school and accept a Professorship of Pharmacology.

At Johns Hopkins, Abel was the chair of pharmacology and biological chemistry, until the departments split in 1908, when Abel became the chair solely of the Department of Pharmacology. At Johns Hopkins, Abel performed his most groundbreaking research and held the position of chair of the department until he retired at the age of 75 in 1932.

=== Isolation of epinephrine ===
Ever since his early years in Europe, Abel showed great interest in isolating pure form of internal gland hormones. The first work that led to his international reputation as a pharmacologist and biochemist was the isolation of epinephrine from adrenal medulla. However, he was only able to isolate a monobenzoyl derivative of epinephrine. While he was improving his processes on decomposing the benzoyl derivative to obtain salts of epinephrine using saponification, a Japanese chemist J. Takamine, who had visited his lab, was able to successfully isolate the neutral base of epinephrine by adding ammonium to highly concentrated extract, a method Abel himself tried but failed due to the use of low concentration of extract. After Takamine&#x27;s success, Abel himself remarked, with great candor, &quot;The efforts of years on my part in this once mysterious field of suprarenal, medullary biochemistry, marred by blunders as they were, eventuated, then, in the isolation of the hormone not in the form of the free base but in that of its monobenzoyl derivative.&quot;

=== Devising early form of dialysis machine ===
Together with L.G. Rowntree and B.B. Turner, Abel devised what they called a &quot;vividiffusion&quot; apparatus, consisting of a series of tubes surrounded by fluid. They first demonstrated the apparatus at the Physiological Congress in Groningen in 1914. By allowing arterial blood to enter at one end of the connection, and later return to circulation through the venous connection after dialysis, they were able to demonstrate the existence of free amino acids in blood. By isolating these amino acids from blood circulation, Abel conducted various subsequent researches on the structure of proteins in the blood. Not only did Abel use the apparatus for his research work, he also realized the great clinical potential such dialysis machine would have on managing the damaging effects of renal failure. The vividiffusion apparatus Abel devised is the precursor to the modern day dialysis machine. He summarized his work in a paper published in 1913, &quot;On the Removal of Diffusable Substances from the Circulating Blood by Means of Dialysis&quot; by Transfusion Science.

=== Crystallization of insulin ===

Abel&#x27;s work on insulin started with an invitation from his old friend Arthur A. Noyes at California Institute of Technology. Noyes had just received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation for research on insulin, and he thought that Abel would be the right person to lead that research. After some preliminary experiments on the subject, Abel decided to take on the research, and replied to his friend, &quot;Will attack insulin. Writing. J. J. Abel.&quot; Abel invested the next few years on purifying insulin. While he was trying various means to purify insulin, he had the idea to measure sulfur content of his extracts and found that the higher the sulfur content, the greater the activity. The discovery not only significantly precipitated progress on extracting active fractions but also offered the very first concrete information on the structure of insulin—sulfur is an integral part of insulin molecules. Continuing with his research on extracting insulin, in November 1925, Abel finally was able to witness one of the most beautiful sights of his life, &quot;glistening crystals of insulin forming on the sides of a test tube&quot;. While at the California Institute of Technology, Abel completed an article in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences entitled &quot;Crystalline Insulin&quot; in 1926. Although Abel&#x27;s work received great compliments from the media and the science community, some doubted the purity of his crystals as preliminary tests revealed that they were in fact proteins. The test result was contrary to the dominant view at the time on proteins—proteins were considered as unlikely to have such highly specific physiological activity shown by a hormone such as insulin. In 1927, he was published in the journal Science for this work with a paper entitled &quot;Chemistry in Relation to Biology and Medicine with Especial Reference to Insulin and Other Hormones&quot;. At the time, Abel&#x27;s laboratory was no doubt the center of insulin research in the United States. A lot of young scientists came to his lab and worked under Abel to study the newly crystallized hormone. Abel himself gradually withdrew from the actual experimental work on insulin after the first four years, but he continued to guide the scientists in his lab to unravel more and more about the structure of insulin molecule.

=== Founding scientific journals ===
Despite his great dedication to experimentation work, Abel&#x27;s historical significance is certainly not restricted to his research work. He was also the founder of a number of influential scientific journals. As more and more research was conducted in the field of biochemistry, Abel realized the importance of having a platform that allowed scientists all around the world to publish their work and report on their findings. He therefore asked his friend Dr. C. A. Herter, Professor of Pharmacology at Columbia University, for help on founding a scientific journal on biochemistry. Together as joint editors, Abel and Herter established the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;. The first issue of the journal appeared in 1905. Motivated by the very same goal of trying to create an outlet for a wide dissemination of new scientific findings, he later founded the J&quot;ournal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics&quot; in 1908.

<text>Chris Reifert (born February 23, 1968) is an American death metal musician.

== Career ==
Reifert had a friend who was a DJ at a local radio station that was running an ad for musicians “Musicians needed for the new lineup of Death, or something like that.” He heard about it before the ad had aired. He was a fan of the band, and had already been collecting the band’s demos, and initially doubted it could have been the same Death that he was familiar with. Reifert responded to the ad, and him and Schuldiner began creating music with one another. Reifert played drums on the Death debut album, &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot;. After parting ways with Chuck Schuldiner in 1987, Reifert elected to remain in the San Francisco Bay Area, forming Autopsy in 1987. In his own band, he played not only drums but performed the vocals as well. He said he started singing out of necessity after trying several friends out on vocals. Cutler and Reifert started off sharing vocal duties before Cutler eventually grew tired of it, and Reifert assumed lead vocal duties. He describes singing and drumming as a “workout.” After several albums, Autopsy split up in 1995 and Reifert and bandmate Danny Coralles began playing in their side-project, Abscess full-time. Autopsy reformed after Abscess&#x27; dissolution in 2010.

Chris Reifert is also known for his many side-projects, including the Ravenous, Doomed, Eat My Fuk, and Violation Wound. He has also performed guest vocals on Machetazo&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonias del Terror Ciego&quot; and the Autopsy-inspired Murder Squad&#x27;s &quot;Ravenous, Murderous&quot;, with further guest appearances for Immortal Fate, Nuclear Death, and &quot;Cathedral of the Damned&quot; on Cathedral&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Last Spire&quot;.
== Artistry and influences ==
Reifert is a pioneer of the death-doom fusion genre. Although his music is more death metal than doom metal, he is one of the first musicians known to have combined the two styles. His vocal style in Autopsy is characterized by &quot;pus-spewing, swallowed vomit grunts and groans.&quot; He is also known for his album cover art. His interviews are noted for his sharp wit and off-the-wall humor.

Reifert has named his early influences as Slayer, Terrorizer, Master, Death, Possessed, Black Sabbath, Pentagram, Candlemass, Witchfinder General, Trouble, Saint Vitus, Frank Marino, Robin Trower, Cream and Alice Cooper.

<doc id="1149745" wikidata="Q78571" url="?curid=1149745" title="Othenio Abel">
<text>Othenio Lothar Franz Anton Louis Abel (20 June 1875 – 4 July 1946) was an Austrian paleontologist and evolutionary biologist. Together with Louis Dollo, he was the founder of &quot;paleobiology&quot; and studied the life and environment of fossilized organisms.

== Life ==
Abel was born in Vienna, the son of the architect Lothar Abel. Abel earned a PhD, after studying both law and science, from the University of Vienna. He remained there as an assistant to Alpine geologist Eduard Suess, before being appointed a professor of paleontology. Three years later, he finished his habilitation thesis as a paleontologist at the University of Vienna. From 1900 to 1907, he worked at the Geologische Reichsanstalt.

In 1907, Abel became an extraordinary professor in Vienna, and from 1917 to 1934 he was a regular professor of paleontology in Vienna. As such, he led several expeditions that gave him broad recognition, such as the Pikermi-expedition to Greece in 1912, an American expedition (1925) and one to South Africa (1929).

Abel became a member of the Leopoldina academy in 1935. From 1935 to 1940, he was a professor at Göttingen University, after which he was retired, age 61. In 1942, he was appointed an honorary member of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft.

== Scientific activity ==
Abel mainly studied fossil vertebrates. He was a supporter of Neo-Lamarckist evolution. His main contribution to the field, however, was the formulation, together with Louis Dollo, of paleobiology, which combines the methods and findings of the natural science biology with the methods and findings of the earth science paleontology. From 1928 onwards, Othenio Abel was the publisher of a journal dedicated to paleobiology, &quot;Paläobiologica&quot;.

In 1914, Abel proposed that fossil dwarf elephants inspired the myth of giant Cyclopes, because the center nasal opening was thought to be a cyclopic eye socket. In 1920 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He also showed great interest in cave bear remains at the so-called &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Cave&quot; near Mixnitz.

Abel was an advocate of orthogenesis, he believed that there were trends in evolution that were internally programmed.

== Political attitude and National Socialism ==
Already as a student, Abel took part in antisemitic riots at the University of Vienna, during the Badeni-crisis of 1897. After the First World War, now a professor, he gave voice to his fear of a power takeover by &quot;Communists, Social Democrats and Jews and more Jews tied to both&quot;. As the journalist Klaus Taschwer publicized in 2012, Abel was responsible for the founding of a secret group of 18 professors that sought to frustrate the research and careers of left-wing and Jewish scientists. The rise in violence of National Socialist student groups towards Jewish students in 1934 were met with sympathy by Abel. When such attacks began to be directed at Catholic and international students as well, Abel, now the university rector, was forced into early retirement by the Austrofascist board. This caused him to emigrate to Germany and accept the post in Göttingen.

He visited Vienna again in 1939, after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Nazi Germany. After seeing how the Nazi flag was shown at the university building, he pronounced this the &quot;Happiest moment of his life&quot;. The new regime honored him with the newly created post of &quot;Honorary Senator&quot; of the university - an honour that was rescinded after the Second World War, in 1945. A letter of recommendation for the Goethe Prize points out how Abel had always &quot;fought in the first line&quot; against the &quot;Judaification&quot; of the university. After the war, he was once again forced into retirement along with other prominent Nazi professors and spent his last days in Mondsee, then known as something of a &quot;Nazi colony&quot;.

<doc id="1149750" wikidata="Q3101366" url="?curid=1149750" title="George Abernethy">
<text>George Abernethy (October 7, 1807 – March 2, 1877) was an American politician, pioneer, notable entrepreneur, and first governor of Oregon under the provisional government based in the Willamette Valley, an area later a part of the American state of Oregon. He traveled to Oregon Country as a secular member of the Methodist mission, where he became involved in politics and helped found the first American newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains.

==Early life==
Abernethy was born on October 7, 1807, in New York City to shoemaker William Abernethy and an unidentified mother. He was of Scottish descent. He received his education in New York as well as learning the commercial trade. In 1830, Abernethy married Anne Pope. Missionary Jason Lee recruited Abernethy in 1839 to join him at the Methodist Mission in Oregon Country. He, his wife, and two children joined the Great Reinforcement that sailed on the ship &quot;Lausanne&quot; around Cape Horn to the Pacific Northwest.

==Oregon==
Arriving on June 1, 1840, Abernethy was placed in charge as Steward of the Oregon Mission, focusing on the Mission&#x27;s mercantile business in Oregon City. His specific instructions from the Methodist board requested an annual

account of all the goods, merchandise, clothing, farming and mechanical utensils, the produce of the farms, and the mechanical shops, the stock on the farm at a fair valuation, together with the worth of the houses, barns, mills, and shops, or whatever else may belong to the Mission, and likewise charge to each member of the Mission family the article or articles he or she may take from the store or farms for his or her use ...

Among his early accomplishments were establishing the first newspaper (the &quot;Oregon Spectator&quot;) in the Oregon Territory and establishing good business relations with the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Abernethy was also a member of the Oregon Lyceum in Oregon City. In 1842 he introduced a resolution there to hold off forming an independent country. This was adopted and counter-acted a resolution introduced by Dr. John McLoughlin of the HBC that had earlier been adopted by the Lyceum.

===Governor===
On June 3, 1845, Abernethy was elected to serve as Provisional Governor of the Oregon Country, defeating Osborne Russell, a member of the outgoing Executive Committee. Abernethy and his supporters were American loyalists who believed that the Provisional Government was strictly interim until the question of U.S. and British claims on the Oregon Country were finalized. Russell, however, headed up the &quot;Independents&quot; faction which wished to create a Republic of the Pacific.

As provisional governor, Abernethy worked to build roads, levied the first property taxes, and sent representatives of the Provisional Government to Washington, D.C., to lobby for official U.S. territorial status. He was reelected in 1847 with the endorsement of the influential Dr. John McLoughlin over Asa Lovejoy, co-founder of Portland.

Among the more interesting prerogatives of Abernethy was his solution to the shortage of U.S. currency throughout the territory. He and eight other leading citizens established the Oregon Exchange Company, which became the de facto territorial mint for a short time. The organization minted the now-rare five dollar and ten dollar &quot;Beaver Coins&quot;, making Oregon one of the few U.S. territories to ever mint its own currency.

The Abernethy administration technically ended when efforts to gain territorial status came to fruition on August 14, 1848. President James K. Polk signed the Oregon Territory Act, and appointed General Joseph Lane as the first official territorial governor. Abernethy continued to carry out his duties until Governor Lane arrived at Oregon City March 3, 1849.

==Later life and legacy==

After leaving office, Abernethy continued doing well in his business. Among other things he served as the Oregon City agent for the pioneer steamer &quot;Lot Whitcomb&quot;, the first steam-powered vessel built on the Willamette River and the second one built in the entire Oregon Country. Abernethy&#x27;s assets were destroyed during the flood of 1861. He moved to Portland shortly after. He died in 1877 at 70 years of age. Abernethy was buried at River View Cemetery.

Today, the Abernethy Bridge in Oregon City is named in his honor. The end of the Oregon Trail, also in Oregon City, lies near an area known as Abernethy Green. Several other public works (and natural features such as streams) in Oregon are also named in his honor; though several are given the variant spelling of Abernathy.

<text>Antonio Abetti (19 June 1846 – 20 February 1928) was an Italian astronomer.

Born in San Pietro di Gorizia (Šempeter-Vrtojba), he earned a degree in mathematics and engineering at the University of Padua. He was married to Giovanna Colbachini in 1879 and they had two sons. He died in Arcetri.

==Work==
Abetti mainly worked in positional astronomy and made many observations of minor planets, comets, and star occultations. He computed the orbit of 170 Maria, a Main belt asteroid.

In 1874 he was part of an Italian expedition to Muddapur, in India, led by Pietro Tacchini to observe a transit of Venus with a spectroscope. Later he became director of the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri and a professor at the University of Florence. He refurbished the observatory at Arcetri by installing a new telescope.

==Honors==
* Member of the Accademia dei Lincei.
* Member of the Royal Astronomical Society.
* The crater Abetti on the Moon is named after both Antonio and his son Giorgio Abetti.
* The minor planet 2646 Abetti is also named after Antonio and his son.

<doc id="1149759" wikidata="Q4454520" url="?curid=1149759" title="Tamper (tool)">
<text>A tamper is a device used to compact or flatten an aggregate or another powdered or granular material, typically to make it resistant to further compression or simply to increase its density.

==Examples==
* Small, handheld tampers are used to compress ground coffee into a puck to prepare espresso. 

* Manual or powered tampers compact gravel before laying a concrete or brick patio or walkway so that the underlying gravel layer does not settle over time, or compress the fill in a utility trench as seen in the illustration. 
* Self-propelled, mechanised ballast tamping machines, which compact the ballast underneath rail tracks.
* Preparing some firearms and artillery pieces for firing may involve tamping the charge, such as explosive material or a projectile, into the barrel. For example, muzzle loaders.
* A fireplace can be tamped with a poker or similar tool to compress the material being burned (wood, coal, peat etc...). This improves the heat/burning efficiency, by reducing the volume of burning material that is exposed to airflow. This is often confused with damping - which involves reducing the intensity of the burn by restricting the flue or by the use of any fire retarding material such as water.

=== Tampers in construction ===
Within the construction field, different types of tampers can be used for different purposes, spaces, and materials.

* A jumping jack, or rammer, is a relatively small, hand-operated compactor. It uses &quot;vibratory force&quot;, which is when mechanical force is used in addition to the machine&#x27;s weight to compact the materials. The jumping jack is composed of a motor, handle, and head. When the motor is started, the head is moved up and down, and the operator steers the machine around the desired area. Jumping jacks work well in small areas and are good for &quot;cohesive soil&quot;, or soil with a large clay content. The video shows a jumping jack being used in construction to prepare for paving.
* A plate compactor, or plate tamp, is another hand-operated compactor that also uses vibratory force. The plate compactor consists of a handle and head that holds the motor. When started, the plate moves up and down within the head, and the operator pushes the compactor around the desired area. Plate compactors work best with granular soils, such as gravel and sand. They come in a variety of sizes due to the flexibility of the push motion. Vibratory plate compactors are the lightest and best for smaller projects, while heavy-duty plate compactors exert the most force and work well for large-scale projects, such as paving.
* A handheld tamper is a small compactor that utilizes &quot;static force&quot;, which is when only the dead weight of the equipment and pressure the operator applies to it compact the materials. These tampers do not have a motor, only a flat plate attached to a handle. The plate is placed on the material the operator wishes to compact and pressed down. Handheld tampers are best used with soil and other small-scale projects due to the lack of great force from mechanical elements.

<doc id="1149769" wikidata="Q5280338" url="?curid=1149769" title="Direct historical approach">
<text>The direct historical approach to archaeology was a methodology developed in the United States of America during the 1920s-1930s by William Duncan Strong and others, which argued that knowledge relating to historical periods is extended back into earlier times. This methodology involves taking an archaeological site that has historical accounts relating to recent periods of occupation and then excavating it to establish continuity back into prehistoric times. The historical data then becomes the basis of analogy and homology for the study of the prehistoric communities at both the particular site and other sites in the region. The main issue with the approach is that in many parts of the world there is no direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region.

==Background==
In the nineteenth century, the archaeological record of the Americas was viewed as an extension into the past of the ethnographically documented record. Human behaviors of the archaeological past were seen as nearly identical to those described ethnographically and thus, they could be studied with minimal training in archaeology. The result of this particular view was the development and regular use of what came to be known as the direct historical approach.

Roland B. Dixon was seen as an early proponent of this approach. In his presidential address to the American Anthropological Association he stated: “one would logically proceed to investigate a [number of sites of known ethnic affiliation], and work back from these,” because it “is only through the known that we can comprehend the unknown, only from a study of the present that we can understand the past.” Strong, who later became attributed to this particular methodology, argued that Dixon set forth the procedure of the direct historical approach. Strong would later go on to say that “once the archeological criteria of [a historically documented] culture had been determined, it [is] then possible to advance from the known and historic into the unknown and prehistoric.”

Oddly, the direct historical approach rarely appears in histories of American anthropology. Similarly, very few texts point out that the direct historical approach was used for three distinct purposes. In American archaeology these were: (1) to identify the cultural association of an archaeological manifestation; (2) to construct relative chronologies of archaeological materials; and (3) to understand the human behaviors that were thought to have produced particular portions of the archaeological record.

==The Direct Historical Approach as a Cultural Identifier==
After the peak of the direct historical approach, Willey wrote about its use as a means of assigning ethnic identity to archaeological phenomena. He explained: “through a series of successive periods prehistoric cultures were linked to proto-historic, historic, and modern descendants. This type of study, sometimes called the ‘direct historical approach,’ has a theoretical basis in cultural continuity. Starting with known, documented habitation sites, certain cultural assemblages were identified and associated with particular tribal groups. Earlier archaeological assemblages were then sought which were not too sharply divergent from the known historic ones, and the procedure was followed backwards in time…The establishment of prehistoric-to-historic continuity is of utmost importance as a springboard for further archaeological interpretation, and, along with general chronological and distributive studies, it is one of the primary historical problems for the American archaeologist.”

Most famously, Cyrus Thomas used the reasoning of the direct historical approach to demonstrate that various earthworks scattered across the eastern and midwestern portions of America (mounds) were produced by the direct genetic and cultural ancestors of historically documented ethnic groups (the indigenous peoples of the Americas).

==The Direct Historical Approach in Establishing Chronology==
In much the same way that the direct historical approach was used to demonstrate ancestor-descendant relationships, it was also used to measure the passage of time (also called chronology). This process involves creating time-based sequences of artifacts by starting with a list of cultural traits related to specific artifact types and then working into the past by determining which traits/artifact types were held by archaeologically represented cultures. Through this theoretical sorting, one can study more than ethnic identification by establishing time-based sequences. After ethnic identification and chronology has been established, the direct historical approach becomes the basis of analogy.

==Issues with the Direct Historical Approach==
There are large parts of the world that are without direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region. Without this connection, the direct historical approach lacks purpose and is unable to enhance archaeological study. If this is the case, archaeologists rely on other archaeological theories and methods.

<doc id="1149772" wikidata="Q7968001" url="?curid=1149772" title="Wanna Be a VJ">
<text>Wanna Be a VJ was a show and contest on MTV in the United States. Contestants were selected from the crowd around MTV&#x27;s Times Square office, and narrowed down via challenges testing the applicants&#x27; music knowledge and personality. Once narrowed down to six contestants, viewers were allowed to vote for contestants by telephone and on the Internet. The winner was awarded $25,000 and a one-year contract to be a veejay on Total Request Live. All three events were hosted by Carson Daly.

==&quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; (1998)==
In the first &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest Jesse Camp beat Dave Holmes. Holmes ended up hosting various shows on MTV until 2001.

Camp&#x27;s unexpected victory caused many viewers to suspect foul play. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ran an article in which a source, identified only by his online handle &quot;UglyPig&quot;, claimed to have hacked the voting site, allowing him to vote more than 3,000 times.

==&quot;Wanna Be a VJ Too&quot; (1999)==
The second &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest was won by 21-year-old Thalia DaCosta, from Sunrise, Florida. Chicago-born actress and media personality Marisa Sullivan, 19 at the time, was a runner-up out of the 12 finalists chosen from 8,000 hopefuls around the country to compete live on TRL in Times Square.

==&quot;Wanna Be a VJ 3&quot; (2000)==
The third &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest was won by Ray Munns.

Munns went on to defend his job five times on a live show entitled &quot;TRL Presents: VJ for a Day&quot;, where he and the contestants introduced the eleven through fifteen videos of &quot;TRL&quot;. Ray was the first ever half-Korean VJ (he is also a quarter-Irish and a quarter-English) and was the first contest winner to stay longer than a year at MTV.

The runner up, Shannon Wiseman of Dallas, North Carolina, became a co-host for UPN&#x27;s &quot;Atlanta Tonight&quot; in 2004 and the host of &quot;NASCAR.COM&#x27;s Post-Race Show&quot; in 2005.

<doc id="1149780" wikidata="Q1134162" url="?curid=1149780" title="Queen Aishwarya of Nepal">
<text>Aishwarya Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah () (7 November 1949 – 1 June 2001) was the Queen of Nepal from 1972 to 2001, also referred to as &quot;Bada Maharani&quot; (बडामहारानी). 

She was celebrated as a woman of classical beauty, famous for her hairstyles and dressing.

== Education ==
She had her school education at St. Helen&#x27;s Convent of Kurseong, India, and St Mary&#x27;s of Jawalakhel, Nepal. She passed S.L.C. from Kanti Ishwari Rajya Laxmi High School in 1963. She was enrolled in the Tribhuvan University-affiliated school, Padmakanya College and graduated in arts in 1967.

== Family background ==
She was from the Rana family which had ruled Nepal for 104 years. She was the eldest daughter of General Kendra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana (1921–1982) and his wife, Shree Rajya Lakshmi Shah (1926–2005). She had two brothers (Suraj Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana; Uday Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana) and two sisters (Queen Komal Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah; Princess Prekshya Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah). After her death, her younger sister Komal became queen consort of Nepal. Her family had been the effective rulers of Nepal until the 1950s. In 1970, she married Birendra, then Crown Prince of Nepal (and her second cousin).

Aishwarya&#x27;s youngest sister Prekshya also married into the Shah dynasty, marrying Gyanendra and Birendra&#x27;s brother Prince Dhirendra who was killed in the palace massacre. They divorced in the 1980s. Princess Prekshya was killed in a helicopter crash on 12 November 2001.

== Queen of Nepal ==
After King Mahendra died in 1972, Birendra became the King and Aishwarya the Queen consort.

Aishwarya was energetic, outspoken and a woman with beauty and brains. She arranged different social and cultural programmes. Queen Aishwarya supported her husband in every steps of her life though difficulties came across them. She was a far-sighted woman who could understand the needs of the country and its people.

The country people took her support for her husband as her dominant nature, but with the passage of time, Queen Aishwarya&#x27;s dominance over her husband reportedly mellowed down and she was seen as a caring companion for her husband, whose popularity increased with time.

== Literary works ==
She was interested in literature and, under the pen-name &quot;Chadani Shah&quot;, wrote dozens of poems, which have been collected under the title Aphnai Akash Aphnai Paribesh. The anthology is prefaced with criticisms about Chadani Shah&#x27;s writing by veteran critics of Nepalese literature. She was also a famous song composer, and her songs were frequently aired by Radio Nepal and Nepal Television.

== Murder ==
Queen Aishwarya was shot dead along with her husband, King Birendra; her son, Prince Nirajan; her daughter, Princess Shruti; and seven other royal family members in the June 1, 2001 palace massacre. It is widely believed that the motive for the murder was the strong opposition to the Crown Prince&#x27;s proposed marriage to Devyani Rana. Queen Aishwarya&#x27;s face was so badly disfigured by the gunshot wound that, for the widely attended state funeral procession, it was covered by a porcelain mask bearing her likeness.

<doc id="1149782" wikidata="Q5203737" url="?curid=1149782" title="D. Michael Fisher">
<text>Dennis Michael Fisher (born November 7, 1944) is a senior United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He also serves as the Distinguished Jurist in Residence at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. A former politician, Fisher has served as a state representative, state senator, and as Attorney General of Pennsylvania. He was the Republican nominee for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2002, losing to Ed Rendell.

==Early career and education==

Fisher began his legal career in his hometown of Pittsburgh following his graduation from Georgetown University with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1966 and Georgetown University Law Center with a Juris Doctor in 1969.

As an Assistant District Attorney for Allegheny County, he handled nearly 1,000 cases, including 25 homicides. He continued to practice law during his career in the General Assembly and was a shareholder or partner in various firms, including Houston Harbaugh, where he practiced from 1984 to 1997. Fisher’s law practice included civil litigation, commercial law, estate planning and real estate.

==Political career==
Before his election as Attorney General, Fisher served for 22 years in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, serving 6 years in the State House and 16 years as a member of the State Senate. He was a member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee and the Majority Whip of the Senate. During his legislative career, he was a leader in criminal and civil justice reform and an architect of many major environmental laws. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1986, serving as the running mate of Bill Scranton.

===Attorney General===
Prior to becoming a judge, he was elected Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1996 and re-elected in 2000. Fisher personally argued major cases in state and federal appellate courts. In March 1998, he successfully argued the case of &quot;Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole v. Scott&quot; before the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court held that the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s exclusionary rule does not apply to parole revocation hearings.

In a 2009 documentary film about the politics behind attempts to move the Barnes Foundation art collection to the Philadelphia Museum of Art called “The Art of the Steal,” Fisher admitted using pressure on Lincoln University officials to get them to approve the move.

===2002 gubernatorial election===

Fisher ran for governor of Pennsylvania in the 2002 election. Early in the campaign, the Republican State Committee gravitated to him as the nominee, much to the chagrin of State Treasurer Barbara Hafer, who had explored a run. After Fisher won the nomination unopposed, Hafer endorsed the Democrat, Ed Rendell and later switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party. Fisher&#x27;s campaign website was praised as being among the best during the 2002 election cycle.

Fisher&#x27;s candidacy was unable to gain traction, and he was down in the polls by double digits throughout the fall. In the end, Fisher could not catch Rendell and lost 53.4%–44.4%.

==Federal judicial service==
Fisher was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to serve with Marjorie Rendell, Governor Rendell&#x27;s wife. Fisher was nominated by President George W. Bush on May 1, 2003, to a seat vacated by Carol Los Mansmann. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 9, 2003, and received commission on December 11, 2003. Fisher officially resigned as Attorney General and assumed his judicial office four days later. He assumed senior status on February 1, 2017.

==Personal life==
Fisher and his wife, Carol, an education consultant, have two children. Michelle is an attorney, and Brett works in the Merchant Services Business. He also has 4 grandchildren; Cecilia, Camden, Elliott, and Judge.

<doc id="1149788" wikidata="Q5593260" url="?curid=1149788" title="Graham Spanier">
<text>Graham Basil Spanier (born July 18, 1948) is a South African-born American sociologist and university administrator who became the 16th president of Pennsylvania State University on September 1, 1995. On November 9, 2011, in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, Spanier and longtime football coach Joe Paterno were “removed from their positions” by the Penn State board of trustees.

Spanier is currently president emeritus and university professor emeritus. He previously held appointments as professor of human development and family studies; sociology, demography, and family and community medicine. He had a one-year post-presidential sabbatical leave following his resignation as president of Penn State in November 2011.

After lengthy criminal proceedings, Spanier was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of child endangerment in March 2017 for his role in the scandal. The conviction was overturned by a federal district judge in April 2019, but reinstated by an appeals court in December 2020. He served a two-month prison sentence throughout the summer of 2021.

Spanier has written a book recounting the Penn State scandal from his perspective, the criminal proceedings which followed and his resulting incarceration. “In the Lions’ Den: The Penn State Scandal and a Rush to Judgment” was released by Gryphon Eagle Press in September 2022.

Spanier is currently a consultant in national and international security, intelligence and risk management.

==Early life and education==
Graham Basil Spanier was born to Rosadele Lurie and Fritz Otto Spanier in Cape Town, South Africa and came to Chicago as an infant when his parents immigrated, concerned by parallels they saw between apartheid in South Africa and fascism in Germany. His father had previously escaped Nazi Germany in 1936; much of his father&#x27;s extended family perished during the Holocaust.

The family moved to a working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, living there until 1956. Spanier&#x27;s father worked in a nuts, bolts and screws warehouse loading and unloading trucks; his mother worked in a clerical position. The family moved to the suburb of Highland Park, where Spanier graduated from Highland Park High School in 1966. His father became postmaster of Highland Park in 1962 and retired from that position in 1975.

Spanier has revealed that his father was physically violent with all three of his children. His sister Anita told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Graham received the most violent beatings, leaving him with lifelong complications. &quot;I&#x27;ve had to have four operations to correct serious deformities inside my head from beatings my father gave me,&quot; Spanier said. &quot;They had to rebuild me from the inside out.&quot;

As a teenager, Spanier largely supported himself financially, working part-time jobs at a radio station, a children&#x27;s clothing store, a legal office, and saving for college by mowing lawns and baby-sitting. He was president of J&amp;A Radio Productions, a Junior Achievement company that produced a weekly show called &quot;Variety&quot; targeted to Chicago-area youth. Along with Brian Ross, he co-founded a radio news service that covered the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

He attended Iowa State University, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in three years (in 1969) and continued his education to earn a master&#x27;s degree (1971). As a graduate student, he taught undergraduate classes in marriage and family sociology while on an assistantship.

During college, Spanier served as a head resident in the residence halls and worked in radio and television at WEEF (Chicago), KASI (Ames, Iowa) and WOI-TV (Ames, Iowa). He had summer jobs as a radio announcer, news director, pizza maker, bank teller and public relations officer. He received numerous honors while a university student for his leadership in student government and campus activities, including the Gold Key of the Cardinal Key Honor Society. Iowa State later honored him with the Distinguished Achievement Citation and an honorary doctorate (2004).

Following his graduation from Iowa State, Spanier attended Northwestern University, where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, and earned his Ph.D. in sociology in 1973.

==Career==
Prior to his tenure as president of Penn State, Spanier served as:
* Member of the Penn State faculty and served in three administrative positions in the College of Health and Human Development: professor of human development and family studies; sociology, demography; and family and community medicine (1973–82).
*Vice provost for undergraduate studies at Stony Brook University (1982–86)
*Provost and vice president for academic affairs at Oregon State University (1986–91)
*Chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (1991–95)

===16th President of The Pennsylvania State University===

During his presidency, Spanier set goals to make Penn State the &quot;top student-centered research university in America&quot; and for the university to lead the nation in &quot;the integration of teaching, research, and service.&quot;

Spanier created the Penn State World Campus, the Schreyer Honors College, the Presidential Leadership Academy, the College of Information Sciences and Technology, the School of International Affairs, and programs in forensic sciences and security and risk analysis. He oversaw the merger with the Dickinson School of Law, creating an accredited and acclaimed two-campus law school. He was recognized by the American Institute of Architects for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to the Profession by a Non-Architect&quot; (2006) and with the Elizabeth Holtzman Award for his improvements to campus landscaping, master planning, and community relations.

During his tenure, applications exceeded 120,000 per year, enrollment grew to 97,000, and the academic standing of dozens of programs rose in national and international rankings.

As president, Spanier made a commitment to spend time with students. He performed with Penn State&#x27;s Musical Theatre students and occasionally with Penn State&#x27;s marching band, the Glee Club, and the Chamber Orchestra. He and his racquetball partner were 11-time Penn State co-ed intramural racquetball champions. He hosted &quot;To the Best of My Knowledge,&quot; a live call-in program on public television and radio, and &quot;Expert Opinion,&quot; a sports topic television program on the Big Ten Network.

==Penn State child sex abuse scandal==
===Resignation from Penn State===
During the investigation into allegations of child sex abuse by former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, dozens of individuals were interviewed by prosecutors, and many were called to testify before a Grand Jury. Those interviewed included Penn State football coaches, staff members and university administrators. Among them were Senior Vice President Gary Schultz, Athletic Director Timothy Curley, Spanier and Head Football Coach Joe Paterno, whose testimony lasted seven minutes. As a result of grand jury testimony, Curley and Schultz were charged with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse.

Spanier issued a statement the day the charges came to light in which he said Curley and Schultz had his &quot;complete confidence&quot;, and they &quot;operate at the highest levels of honesty.&quot; Spanier was criticized for expressing support for Curley and Schultz, and failing to express any concern for Sandusky&#x27;s alleged victims. After this, he largely dropped from public view. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, the Board of Trustees ordered him to keep silent. Paterno&#x27;s son, Jay Paterno, reported that the board of trustees chair, John P. Surma, then ordered that Coach Paterno&#x27;s weekly press conference be canceled.

On Nov. 6, 2011, a Facebook group titled “Fire Graham Spanier” was created by a Penn State alumnus to pressure the board of trustees. The group never achieved more than 100 members. Also on Facebook, an event titled &quot;Sit in Silence during the Alma Mater&quot; encouraged attendees of the final home football game of the season on Saturday, Nov. 12 to sit in silence while the Penn State Blue Band performed the Alma Mater. An online petition calling for Spanier&#x27;s ouster was created at change.org by a professional blogger and self-described &quot;reality-based charismatic/Pentecostal Christian&quot; who had no connection to the university. It garnered over 1,800 signatures in four days before closing.

At emergency meetings on Nov 5 and 6, Spanier briefed the board of trustees. The board decided that they alone wanted to manage the unfolding crisis. On the night of November 9, the board announced that Spanier had resigned and Paterno had been fired — in both cases, effective immediately. Several Penn State sources told StateCollege.com and &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; of Harrisburg that Spanier and Board of Trustees vice chairman John Surma mutually agreed that the best way forward for all involved would be for Spanier to resign &quot;voluntarily and with grace.&quot; Other sources said the decision was not entirely voluntary; earlier that day &quot;The Express-Times&quot; of Easton reported the Board of Trustees had given Spanier an ultimatum—resign before that night&#x27;s meeting or be fired. A member of the board later told &quot;The Morning Call&quot; of Allentown that the board was very angry about his statement of unconditional support for Curley and Schultz. ABC News reported that Spanier had submitted a letter of resignation earlier in the day on Nov. 9. Provost Rodney Erickson was named his successor.

In the wake of the Sandusky investigation, a Phoenix, Arizona private investigator named Paul McLaughlin publicly alleged he had been sexually abused by Penn State Professor John R. Neisworth and two other men in the late 1970s and early 1980s. McLaughlin claimed to possess a tape of telephone conversations with university officials, including Spanier, to verify that he had tried twenty years later to inform the university, but he later had to file an affidavit acknowledging that he did not have such tapes. The charges filed against Neisworth and the two other men in 2005 were dropped that same year for lack of evidence.

===The Freeh Report and related lawsuits===
In November 2011 the Penn State Board of Trustees hired former FBI Director Louis Freeh to conduct an external investigation into the handling of the Sandusky matter. Released on July 12, 2012, the Freeh report concluded that Spanier, Curley, Schultz and Paterno &quot;concealed Sandusky&#x27;s activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities.&quot; In addition, the report said the four men &quot;exhibited a striking lack of empathy for Sandusky&#x27;s victims by failing to inquire as to their safety and well-being&quot; and that they allowed him &quot;to have continued, unrestricted and unsupervised access to the University&#x27;s facilities and affiliation with the University&#x27;s prominent football program.&quot;
Spanier and his attorneys disputed the accuracy of Freeh&#x27;s findings, alleging it contained &quot;many, many errors.&quot;

A later report commissioned by the Paterno family by former U.S. Attorney General and former Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, concluded that the Freeh report was &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and a &quot;failure.&quot; Freeh&#x27;s firm was reportedly paid $6.5 million by the Penn State trustees to compile the report. Subsequent billings have raised the amount to $8.2 million.
A ruling by an arbitrator for the State Employee Retirement System, in an appeal pertaining to the revocation of Sandusky&#x27;s pension in June 2014, also called into serious question the credibility of the Freeh Report.

Earlier that month, on July 11, one year after the release of the Freeh report, Spanier&#x27;s attorneys filed a lawsuit against Freeh and Freeh&#x27;s firm, Sporkin &amp; Sullivan, citing slander, libel and defamation. The suit demanded monetary damages and a jury trial. In two rulings in Centre County Court, and in a subsequent appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, Freeh&#x27;s efforts to force Spanier to file the details of his formal complaint were turned down as premature. On February 25, 2014, over the objections of Louis Freeh and his law firm, Spanier was granted a stay in his defamation lawsuit until his criminal case is resolved.

On February 10, 2016, Spanier filed separate lawsuits against Freeh and Penn State, claiming university trustees and Freeh colluded in placing blame for Sandusky&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct on lack of action by Paterno, Schultz, Curley and Spanier. Spanier seeks a damage judgment against Freeh for defamation, and against the university for breaching terms agreed to upon his resignation in 2011.

===Criminal charges===
On November 1, 2012, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly announced that Spanier had been indicted for grand jury perjury, obstruction of justice, child endangerment, failure to report child abuse and conspiracy in connection with the scandal. The charges were partially based on findings in the Freeh report.
 Curley and Schultz were also indicted for these charges in a superseding indictment. On July 30, 2013, the charges formally moved ahead following a preliminary hearing by District Judge William Wenner.

Pretrial hearings in the case against Spanier began on December 17, 2013. Dauphin County Judge Todd Hoover ruled at that time that Spanier&#x27;s attorneys would not be allowed to call to the stand Cynthia Baldwin. Baldwin, who had been an attorney for Penn State, had accompanied Spanier, Schultz and Curley to their grand jury appearances in 2011. All three men would testify they believed Baldwin was their legal representation. Later, under the protection of a proffer agreement—a form of immunity—with the attorney general, Baldwin testified against the three men in her grand jury testimony. Attorneys for Spanier, Curley and Schultz asserted this was a violation of attorney-client privilege and their clients&#x27; civil rights. Elizabeth Ainslie, one of Spanier&#x27;s attorneys, said, &quot;I was never notified that Ms. Baldwin was going to testify against Graham Spanier, and neither was he. [Baldwin] says different things at different times about who she represented.&quot;

On January 22, 2016, a three judge panel of the Pennsylvania Superior Court unanimously overturned a decision by Judge Hoover and threw out charges of perjury, obstruction and conspiracy against Spanier and Schultz, and charges of obstruction and conspiracy against Curley. The court found that Baldwin breached attorney-client privilege by testifying as to confidential communications between her and Spanier to the grand jury.

===Trial and conviction===
Shortly before their cases were to go to trial, Curley and Schultz accepted plea deals for one misdemeanor count each of endangering the welfare of children. Spanier refused a similar deal and went to trial on March 20, 2017, on two counts of endangering the welfare of children and one charge alleging conspiracy with Curley and Schultz to cover up a molestation allegation against Sandusky; both Curley and Schultz testified at Spanier&#x27;s trial. On March 24, Spanier was found not guilty of the conspiracy charge and one of the endangerment counts. He was, however, found guilty of one count of endangerment in a split verdict. His attorney indicated they would appeal the guilty verdict.

On June 2, 2017, Spanier was sentenced to two months jail and two months house arrest. Additionally, Spanier was ordered to pay a $7,500 fine and perform 200 hours of community service. Curley and Schultz began serving their sentences on July 15, but Spanier remained free while he appealed his conviction. On June 26, 2018, his appeal to the Superior Court was rejected by a vote of two to one. One of Spanier&#x27;s attorneys said that Spanier would pursue a further appeal.

On April 30, 2019, one day before Spanier was to have reported to Centre County Correctional Facility to begin serving a two-month sentence, his conviction was overturned. U.S. Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick ruled the conviction &quot;was based on a criminal statute that did not go into effect until six years after the conduct in question, and is therefore in violation of Spanier’s federal constitutional rights.”

On December 1, 2020, Spanier&#x27;s conviction was reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third District.

On May 27, 2021, Spanier was handed an order to begin serving two months at the county jail on July 9, followed by two months of house arrest, for a misdemeanor conviction of endangering the welfare of children. He was convicted by a jury in March 2017 but he remained out of jail due to appeals.

On June 5, 2021, The Harrisburg (Pennsylvania) Patriot-News published a letter from Richard Black of Susquehanna, Pennsylvania. Black wrote, “As foreman of the jury that convicted Dr. Graham Spanier, I have carried (since then) the burden that the verdict was a gross miscarriage of justice! At the time, I voiced this privately with the friends and associates. It was my hope and prayer that the verdict would be set aside on appeal and that justice would prevail. Now I see that a jail term has been imposed and I can no longer remain silent. It is my firm and considered opinion that the prosecution of Dr. Spanier must end forthwith!”

On June 7, 2021, Spanier was incarcerated at Centre County Correctional Facility in Bellefonte, PA.

On August 4, 2021, Spanier was released from Centre County Correctional Facility after serving 58 days of his 60-day sentence. His sentence stipulates that he will serve two months of house confinement and complete 200 hours of community service.

=== &quot;In the Lions&#x27; Den&quot; ===
Following his incarceration, Spanier completed writing his account of the Sandusky case and its aftermath. &quot;In the Lions’ Den: The Penn State Scandal and a Rush to Judgment&quot; was published in September 2022 by Gryphon/Eagle Press.

A review of the book in &quot;Library Journal&quot; states that Spanier&#x27;s memoir “... refutes the highly disputed report prepared by former FBI director Louis Freeh…. Using evidence obtained through freedom of information laws and other sources, the author documents how many of his accusers have since been discredited and makes a convincing case of his innocence.”

Edward Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor, wrote a testimonial for Spanier&#x27;s account, saying “It is undeniable that this book raises real questions about our justice system.” John H. Kramer, former executive director of the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing and former staff director of the United States Sentencing Commission, called it “... a must read for understanding the depth to which justice can fall….&quot;

<text>The Suzuki VX800 is a shaft drive V-twin street motorcycle manufactured by Suzuki. 

The VX800 was designed at U.S. Suzuki&#x27;s Design Studio in Brea, California from 1986 to 1989, and produced in the years 1990 to 1997. Lackluster sales in the United States brought the model to an end in 1993, the European version was produced until 1997.

==Variations==
There were four variations of the VX800:
*the Japanese version featured a slightly shorter frame.
*the European version was equipped with the pre-production 75-degree crank pin offset for smoother operation at high engine speeds. 
*the American version was offered from 1990 to 1993 only. It was equipped with the Intruder&#x27;s 45-degree crank pin offset as American Suzuki tests riders claimed the 75-degree crank offset made the engine feel dull and lifeless at US speeds. It also makes for a more charismatic exhaust cadence. American Suzuki also requested that the overall gearing be lower for better acceleration. The USA version has a secondary reduction of 1.133, where other markets are 1.096. 
*the California version was the same as the USA version, but with additional anti-smog equipment.

==Engine==
The engine for the VX800 was derived from the Intruder 750, with a 3 mm larger bore to increase displacement, and larger 36 mm carburetors replacing the 34 mm units. The addition of a back torque limiting clutch, similar in operation as the VS1400 Intruder.

Model VS51A, 45-degree crank pin offset, model VS51B, 75-degree crank pin offset
: Type: Four-stroke, water-cooled, OHC TSCC, 45-degree V-twin
: Piston displacement: 805 cc
: Bore &amp; Stroke: 
: Compression ratio: 10.0:1
: Carburetor, front: Mikuni BDS36SS, single
: Carburetor, rear: Mikuni BS36SS, single
: Transmission: 5-speed constant mesh
: Final drive: Shaft, 3.090:1

<doc id="1149802" wikidata="Q7370264" url="?curid=1149802" title="Rotary converter">
<text>A rotary converter is a type of electrical machine which acts as a mechanical rectifier, inverter or frequency converter. 

Rotary converters were used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), or DC to AC power, before the advent of chemical or solid state power rectification and inverting. They were commonly used to provide DC power for commercial, industrial and railway electrification from an AC power source.
==Principles of operation==



The rotary converter can be thought of as a motor–generator, where the two machines share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the rotary converter consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator, which allows direct current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power, which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the direct current. The other part is alternating current from the slip rings, which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator. 

The device can be reversed and DC applied to the field and commutator windings to spin the machine and produce AC power. When operated as a DC to AC machine it is referred to as an inverted rotary converter.

One way to envision what is happening in an AC-to-DC rotary converter is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could rectify the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch. The rotary converter is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the rotary converter avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.

The advantage of the rotary converter over the discrete motor–generator set is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a motor–generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor–generator set include adjustable voltage regulation, which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.

In this first illustration of a single-phase to direct-current rotary converter, it may be used five different ways:
* If the coil is rotated, alternating currents can be taken from the collector rings, and it is called an alternator.
* if the coil is rotated, direct current can be taken from the commutator, and it is called a dynamo.
* If the coil is rotated, two separate currents can be taken from the armature, one providing direct current and the other providing alternating current. Such a machine is called a &quot;double current generator&quot;.
* If a direct current is applied to the commutator, the coil will begin to rotate as a commutated electric motor and an alternating current can be taken out of the collector rings. This is called an &quot;inverted rotary converter&quot; (see inverter).
* If the machine is brought up to synchronous speed by external means and if the direction of the current through the armature has the correct relationship to the field coils, then the coil will continue to rotate in synchronism with the alternating current as a synchronous motor. A direct current can be taken from the commutator. When used this way, it is called a &quot;rotary converter&quot;.

===Self-balancing dynamo===

The self-balancing dynamo is of similar construction to the single- and two-phase rotary converter. It was commonly used to create a completely balanced three-wire 120/240-volt AC electrical supply. The AC extracted from the slip rings was fed into a transformer with a single center-tapped winding. The center-tapped winding forms the DC neutral wire. It needed to be driven by a mechanical power source, such as a steam engine, diesel engine, or electric motor. It could be considered a rotary converter used as a double current generator; the alternating current was used to balance the DC neutral wire.

==History==
The rotary converter was invented by Charles S. Bradley in 1888. A typical use for this type of AC/DC converter was for railway electrification, where utility power was supplied as alternating current. Trains were designed to work on direct current, since DC traction motors could be built with speed and torque characteristics suited to propulsion use, and could be controlled for variable speed. The AC induction motor was not as well suited to traction use when powered from a fixed frequency supply. Before the invention of mercury arc rectifiers and high-power semiconductor rectifiers, this conversion could only be accomplished using motor-generators or rotary converters.

Rotary converters soon filled the need to use all the competing electric power delivery systems that cropped up in the 1880s and early 1890s. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. Most machinery and appliances at that time were operated by DC power, which was provided at the user level by rotary converter substations for residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Rotary converters provided high current DC power for industrial electrochemical processes such as electroplating. Steel mills needed large amounts of on-site DC power for their main roll drive motors. Similarly, paper mills and printing presses required direct current to start and stop their motors in perfect synchronization to prevent tearing the sheet.

===Obsolescence===
The stopgap of needing to use rotary converters was slowly overcome as older systems were retired or upgraded to match the newer AC universal system. AC to DC synchronous rotary converters were made obsolete by mercury arc rectifiers in the 1930s and later on by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous rotary converters operated until 1999. Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury arc and semiconductor rectifiers did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance. 

AC replaced DC in most applications and eventually the need for local DC substations diminished along with the need for rotary converters. Many DC customers converted to AC power, and on-site solid-state DC rectifiers were used to power the remaining DC equipment from the AC supply.

<text>Josiah Jesse Holden Camp IV is an American musician and television personality who was the winner of the first &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest on MTV.

==Career==
Camp entered MTV&#x27;s first &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest in 1998. Portraying himself as homeless and projecting the image of a &quot;street kid&quot;, controversy arose when it was discovered that he had been raised and attended private school in Connecticut. Additionally, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reported that an internet source, known only by the handle &quot;UglyPig&quot;, claimed to have cast over 3,000 votes for Camp in the &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest, exploiting a security flaw in the system.

Camp beat fellow contestant Dave Holmes for a VJ job on &quot;MTV Live&quot;. Holmes was also later hired by MTV.

Camp was popular on the channel, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; saying: &quot;An unlikely instant star, he was soon adored by preteen fans, who crowded around him devotedly as he paraded through Times Square in feather boas, leather trousers, sparkly Steven Tyler scarves, and mismatched leg-warmers during his wacky man-on-the-street segments for MTV.&quot;

Camp held his position on TRL with Carson Daly as the main host for over a year. Camp also hosted two additional programs of his own for daytime MTV audiences. Camp convinced MTV executives to let him book acts such as Faster Pussycat, Ratt, Sebastian Bach and Dee Snider as guests on his summer series &quot;Lunch with Jesse&quot; at a time when these artists were years past being in rotation on the channel. For over a year, Camp hosted the contemporary rock program &quot;MTV Rocks Off&quot; interviewing artists such as Joey Ramone, Henry Rollins, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Sugar Ray, Garbage, Peter Steele, Silverchair and Metallica.

Following his departure from &quot;TRL&quot;, Camp parlayed his MTV fame into a rock career with his 1999 debut album &quot;Jesse &amp; the 8th Street Kidz&quot; on the Hollywood Records label. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo (Green Day, Kid Rock) and Julian Raymond (Cheap Trick, Glen Campbell), and specialized in the 1980s-style glam metal that fell out of fashion almost a decade before the album&#x27;s release. Guest stars on the album included Stevie Nicks duetting with Camp on ballad &quot;My Little Saviour&quot;, Rick Nielsen, Steve Hunter and Gregg Bissonette. Camp cowrote the album with Alex Kane (Life, Sex and Death, Antiproduct), Bam Bam and Jo Almeida (Dogs D&#x27;Amour) and Share Pedersen (Vixen, Bubble). The album sold 2,600 copies in its opening week.

A video for the first single &quot;See You Around&quot; included cameos from Reverend Run and Marky Ramone. Critical reviews were mixed. Rob Sheffield gave the album a review (3.5 stars) in Rolling Stone, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album 1 star out of a possible 5, writing: &quot;At times, the music is catchy, but most of the time it&#x27;s simply irritating, since Camp&#x27;s singing is every bit as grating as his persona.&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin noted that the album was well-produced and featured solid performances by the session musicians, but that the choice to obscure Camp&#x27;s vocals on most songs betrays his limited musical ability, particularly on the duet with the far more talented Stevie Nicks.

Camp appeared in an impromptu cameo on the documentary titled &quot;Power &amp; Control LSD in The Sixties&quot;, by Aron Ranen.

==Personal life==
Camp was born in Granby, Connecticut. His father was a college professor and his mother was an elementary school principal. Camp attended public school in Granby through the eighth grade. For high school, Camp received a scholarship to Loomis Chaffee, a New England boarding school, graduating in 1997. Also in 1997, Camp received a scholarship to the drama department of UCLA but never attended.

On July 19, 2018, Camp was reported missing by his sister Marish to the Riverside Police Department. She stated that he had been out of contact with his family for about a week, which was unusual behavior for him, and that he was seen in Riverside around &quot;the 11th or 12th of July&quot;. He was later seen in Fontana on July 19, when a bike patrol officer made a &quot;pedestrian check&quot; on Camp outside of a Sherwin-Williams store, just hours before his sister reported him missing.

On July 24, 2018, the Riverside Police Department confirmed that Camp was found safe.

<text>Denise Louise Faustman (born 1958) is an American physician and medical researcher. An associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and director of the Immunobiology Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, her work specializes in diabetes mellitus type 1 (formerly called juvenile diabetes) and other autoimmune diseases. She has worked at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston since 1985.

==Education and career==
Faustman was born in Royal Oak, Michigan in 1958. In 1978, she received her BS in zoology and chemistry from the University of Michigan. She earned a PhD in transplantation immunology in 1982 and an MD in 1985 from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. She did her internship and residency in medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

==Research==
Faustman&#x27;s current research is based on the observation that autoreactive T cells (T cells that mistakenly attack the body&#x27;s own cells and tissues) are more sensitive than normal T cells to the effects of TNF-alpha (TNF-α), a cytokine that influences the immune system. Under some conditions, TNF-α causes T cells to undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Faustman&#x27;s hypothesis is that certain autoimmune diseases can be treated by stimulating TNF-α to trigger apoptosis in autoimmune T cells.

Prior to entering human clinical trials, Faustman&#x27;s approach was tested in non-obese diabetic mice (NOD mice), a strain of mice that spontaneously develops type 1 diabetes. Injecting the mice with a common inflammatory agent that increases the production of TNF-α, called complete Freund&#x27;s adjuvant (CFA), and a preparation of spleen cells reversed type 1 diabetes in mice with end-stage disease and allowed the beta islet cells to regenerate.

Faustman hypothesized that this regeneration may be attributed in part to the re-differentiation of the spleen cells – that although the splenic stem cells were not obligatory for regeneration to occur, these cells could hasten regeneration. The source of islet cell regeneration is debated. Faustman&#x27;s team was the first to document type 1 diabetes reversal in mice and in a subsequent phase I trial demonstrated successful human clinical results who had received the BCG vaccination. Researchers from three laboratories funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation confirmed that Dr. Faustman&#x27;s protocol can successfully reverse type 1 diabetes in end-stage mice; however, they did not find that the splenic cells played a role and suggested that the source of islet cell regeneration was proliferation of existing pancreatic islet cells. A research group led by a researcher from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) replicated Faustman&#x27;s work in mice with type 1 diabetes.

===Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine===
Former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, whose wife died of type 1 diabetes complications and who has declared a desire to see the disease cured in his lifetime, is a patron of her work. The Iacocca Foundation helped raise the $11.5 million needed to support a Phase I human clinical trial (for safety) at Massachusetts General Hospital to test vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a weakened strain of bacteria that is used in the prevention of tuberculosis and in the treatment of bladder tumors and bladder cancer, as a potential treatment for advanced type 1 diabetes. Like CFA in the mouse (not approved for use in humans), BCG induces TNF-α production in humans. In some human trials, BCG was not found to prevent type 1 diabetes, or lead to type 1 diabetes remission in those who are newly diagnosed, although one study from Israel showed disease remission in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, and an observational study from Turkey suggested that multiple doses of the BCG vaccine in childhood may protect against the development of type 1 diabetes. Faustman hypothesizes that the optimal dose of BCG was not utilized in previous trials. Faustman hypothesizes that BCG could induce a permanent gene expression that restores regulatory T cells (Tregs), helping to prevent the immune system attack which characterizes type 1 diabetes.

===Clinical trials===
Faustman and co-workers published efficacy data from the Phase I trial NCT00607230 in 2012. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study, six participants with long-term (mean duration of disease 15 years) type 1 diabetes were randomized to repeated BCG vaccinations (n=3) or placebo (n=3). The participants were matched to control subjects without diabetes (n=6) and also compared to reference subjects with and without the disease. Blood samples were monitored weekly for 20 weeks. Two of the three BCG-treated participants experienced a transient but statistically significant rise in C-peptide levels compared to reference subjects. Participants who received BCG vaccination also experienced a transient increase in the number of circulating dead autoreactive T cells against insulin. One participant who was randomized to the placebo arm also had similar rises in C-peptide and dead autoreactive T cells after unexpectedly developing an acute infection with the Epstein-Barr virus; it, like the BCG vaccination, is known to induce TNF. Faustman et al. concluded that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies advanced type 1 diabetes. The data from the Phase I trial has sparked some controversy regarding the scientific rigor of the study, and the JDRF and the ADA made a joint statement listing concerns with the trial.

<doc id="1149822" wikidata="Q7721581" url="?curid=1149822" title="The Castle School">
<text>The Castle School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form with academy status, located in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, England, which serves the town and the surrounding villages. Pupils from Bristol also attend the school. There are around 1,500 pupils, including 300 in the sixth form.

The school site on Park Road has seen additions in recent years including the community sports centre, the Octagon Drama Studio and in 2024 a new Post-16 Centre and a 20-classroom Maths and Science building. 

Former headmaster Adrian Verwoert was appointed a CBE for services to education in May 2004. Joining the school in 1980, he was appointed as head in 1988. He was succeeded by Melanie Warnes in September 2004. She left in 2014.

==History==
In 1862, Handel Cossham, a local preacher, built the original village school, a British School, at Gillingstool. Some years later, because of overcrowding, a new infant school building was added adjacent to the original school. In 1952 the school was separated into infants, juniors and seniors and the latter formed the Thornbury County Secondary school. Before this it was an &#x27;all-age&#x27; school taking pupils up to age thirteen, known as Thornbury Council School.

In 1962, during the headship of Mr Cliff J. Martin, plans were drawn up for a new building to house the expanding secondary school. Building work started the following year on Park Road, the site used as the school&#x27;s playing field. In 1965, the building was opened under the new name of &quot;The Castle School&quot;, which reflected the school&#x27;s new position adjacent to Thornbury Castle, whilst keeping the same initials (TCS). The official opening ceremony took place in 1966, attended by the Duke of Beaufort, Chancellor at the University of Bristol at the time.

The county infant and junior schools at Gillingstool later formed the Leaze School, which is now known as Gillingstool Primary School.

The school became a comprehensive in 1972, the same year that Thornbury Grammar School moved from its site on Gloucester Road to new buildings in Alveston (also becoming a comprehensive with the new name of Marlwood School). The Castle School took over the Gloucester Road buildings, which became its Sixth Form Centre for a number of years until the new Post-16 facilities opened in 2024 and the school was able to unite on the Park Road site.

<doc id="1149826" wikidata="Q209906" url="?curid=1149826" title="Viewfinder">
<text>In photography, a viewfinder is a device on a camera that a photographer uses to determine exactly where the camera is pointed, and approximately how much of that view will be photographed. A viewfinder can be mechanical (indicating only direction and approximate view), with simple optical components, with precision optics and optical functions, or a digital accessory device used with digital cameras.

== View camera ==

These cameras had no separate viewfinder. The exact image (although upside-down and reversed left-right) was viewed on a ground glass installed either in a replaceable plateholder, or in a spring back where springs hold the ground glass at the focus plane until a photographic plateholder is slid in front of it. Spring backs usually had a flip-up cover protecting the ground glass. A black focusing cloth was used with larger models.

== Mechanical finders ==
Later referred to as &quot;sports finders&quot;, for many sports and newspaper applications optical viewfinders gave too small an image and were inconvenient to use for scenes that were changing rapidly. For these purposes a simple arrangement of two wire rectangles, a smaller one nearer the eye and a larger one further away, was used, without optics; the two rectangles were aligned so the smaller one was centered in the larger, and the larger rectangle would give an indication of what would be included. Cameras with sportsfinders usually had optical viewfinders also.

== Simple optical viewfinders ==
A single divergent (plano-concave) lens, in front of a frame, when close to the eye, acts as a viewfinder. Adding a convergent (plano-convex) lens makes a very short reversed Galilean (upright image) telescope. For movie camera or others with changeable lenses, outline marks on one of the viewfinder lenses could show the different fields of view for the different camera lenses.

== Waist level (reflecting) viewfinders ==
Simple reflecting viewfinders, known also as &quot;brilliant finders&quot;, comprised a small forward-looking lens, a small mirror at 45° behind it, and a lens at the top; the user held the camera at waist level and looked down into the lens, where a small image could be seen. Such viewfinders were integrated into box cameras, and fitted to the side of folding cameras. These viewfinders were fitted to inexpensive cameras.


== Twin-lens reflex viewfinders ==
Twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras use a viewfinding lens with the same focal length as the camera lens, so it has the same field of view and focus properties. With a mirror, of similar size to the film, held at 45°, it projects an upright image onto a focusing ground glass screen viewable from above. The camera can be then be held steady at waist level. Although the viewfinder lens was similar to the camera lens, the optical quality was less important and so the cost is reduced. TLR viewfinders do not have the interrupted viewing and shutter lag of the SLR type and so is preferred for dance photography. Reinhold Heidecke cited his experience with periscope focusing from the German trenches in 1916 as the inspiration for the Rolleiflex line in 1929. Some similar-looking cameras are actually simple box cameras with a waist-level viewfinder.

== Single-lens reflex viewfinders ==
Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras use the camera lens itself, to completely eliminate parallax, the significant field-of-view error for close subjects caused by the offset distance between the viewfinder&#x27;s lens and the camera&#x27;s lens. Early SLRs were plate cameras, with a mechanism to insert a mirror between the lens and the film which reflected the light upwards, where it could be seen at waist level on a ground glass screen. When ready to take the picture, the mirror was pivoted out of the way (without moving the camera). Later SLR still cameras had a mechanism which flipped the mirror out of the way when the shutter button was pressed, opened and closed the shutter, and then moved the mirror back. The Zeiss Ikon Contax S was the first SLR camera to allow easy eye-level viewing by using a roof pentaprism to laterally reverse the inverted camera image (the reflex mirror had already vertically reversed the image). SLR movie cameras used a beamsplitter partial mirror to split the camera image between the shutter and film, and the viewfinder. A major advantage of SLR viewfinders is that any change of camera lens did not affect the viewing accuracy, and accurate camera focus did not depend on correct linking or calibration.

== Rangefinders ==
Some sophisticated 20th century cameras with direct viewfinders had coincidence (split-image) rangefinders, initially with separate windows from the viewfinder, later integrated with it; they were called rangefinder cameras. Cameras with interchangeable lenses had to indicate the field of view of each lens in the viewfinder; more usually, interchangeable viewfinders to match the lenses were used. 


==Contemporary viewfinders==

Viewfinders can be optical or electronic. An optical viewfinder is simply a reversed telescope that displays what the camera sees. It has many drawbacks, but it also has advantages; it consumes no power, it does not wash out in sunlight, and it has &quot;full resolution&quot; (i.e. the resolution of the photographer&#x27;s eye). Modern electronic viewfinders (EVF) are LCD or OLED based display devices. In addition to its primary purpose, an electronic viewfinder can be used to replay previously captured material, and as an on-screen display to browse through menus. 

A still camera&#x27;s optical viewfinder typically has one or more small supplementary LED displays surrounding the view of the scene. On a film camera, these displays show shooting information such as the shutter speed and aperture and, for autofocus cameras, provide an indication that the image is correctly focussed. Digital still cameras will typically also display information such as the current ISO setting and the number of remaining shots which can be taken in a burst. Another display which overlays the view of the scene is often provided. It typically shows the location and state of the camera&#x27;s provided auto-focus points. This overlay can also provide lines or a grid which assist in picture composition.


It is not uncommon for a camera to have two viewfinders. For example, a digital still camera may have an optical viewfinder and an electronic one. The latter can be used to replay previously captured material, has an on-screen display, and can be switched off to save power. A camcorder may have two viewfinders, both electronic. The first is viewed through a magnifying eyepiece, and due to a rubber eyepiece it can be viewed perfectly even in bright light. The second viewfinder would be larger, of a higher resolution, and may be mounted on the side of the camera. Because it consumes more power, a method is often provided to turn it off to save energy.

In late 2010, Fujifilm announced hybrid viewfinder of optical viewfinder and electronic viewfinder in one viewfinder for its highend compact cameras. There is a half mirror prism that reflect data from LCD to the optical viewfinder, so we can see both the shooting frame and the shooting data. A button can change the hybrid function to electronical viewfinder by blocking the image through the optical viewfinder with moving a half mirror prism to be a straight up mirror.

Viewfinders are used for virtually all cameras whether still or movie, film, electronic analog (Television) or digital. Many digital sensor cameras do not have a separate viewfinder. For those cameras, the electronic image is shown on a small accessory screen for composition and focusing purposes. CCTVs and webcams do not need any viewfinding device.

<doc id="1149828" wikidata="Q16156990" url="?curid=1149828" title="Dave Holmes (actor)">
<text>David Robert Holmes (born March 14, 1971) is an American actor, writer, television host, podcaster, producer, and former VJ who gained national attention as the runner-up on MTV&#x27;s first &quot;Wanna Be a VJ&quot; contest in 1998. From the beginning, he distinguished himself from other candidates with an encyclopedic knowledge of music trivia.

==Early life==
Born in New Jersey and raised in St. Louis, Holmes&#x27;s family includes parents Charles and Mary Lou and two older brothers, Dan and Steve. The family runs a financial consulting business in Clayton, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. Holmes attended Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School, the Saint Louis Priory School and the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he worked at WCHC, the campus radio station, and interned at WCCA-TV, Worcester&#x27;s public access television station.

==Career==
Despite his loss to Jesse Camp, MTV hired Holmes as a VJ shortly after &quot;Wanna Be a VJ.&quot; He went on to host several MTV shows, including &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Video Clichés&quot;, a &quot;Real World&quot; reunion special, and the popular &quot;Say What? Karaoke&quot; until 2001. He also was a co-host and substitute host on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. His MTV career lasted about three years longer than Camp&#x27;s.

After leaving MTV in 2002, Holmes hosted FX&#x27;s weekly movie night &quot;DVD on TV&quot; for 10 seasons, and Court TV&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Solution&quot; for six. He also hosted CBS&#x27;s reality comedy series &quot;Fire Me Please&quot; in 2005. On July 7, 2007, he co-hosted Bravo&#x27;s coverage of the Live Earth concerts with Karen Duffy. He also appeared on a variety of talking-head shows for VH1, E!, Tru TV on BBC. Holmes had a recurring role as &quot;Leslie Frost&quot; on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Reno 911!&quot;

Holmes came out as a gay man in &quot;Out&quot; magazine in 2002. On September 23, 2010, Holmes contributed a video to the &quot;It Gets Better&quot; project, spearheaded by advice columnist and gay rights activist Dan Savage.

He has been an editor-at-large for &quot;Esquire&quot; since 2015. Currently, he is the host of the LGBTQ-themed Earwolf podcast &quot;Homophilia&quot;, which &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;thoughtful and charming.&quot; He also hosts the Maximum Fun comedy quiz show &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (formerly &quot;International Waters&quot;), and, along with musician Mike Doughty, the &quot;Real World&quot;–themed Feral Audio podcast &quot;Truu Stowray&quot;. He also appeared in a series of commercials for Ford Motor Company.

Since 2003, Holmes has co-hosted the live comedy game show &quot;The Friday Forty&quot; with &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; executive producer Scott M. Gimple. He is also an on-air personality on the SiriusXM music channel The Spectrum.

On 28 June 28 2016, Penguin Random House&#x27;s Crown Archetype imprint published Holmes&#x27; nonfiction book &quot;Party of One: A Memoir in 21 Songs.&quot; The memoir chronicles Holmes&#x27;s experiences coming to self-acceptance during adolescence and early adulthood, with popular music as a guide and backdrop, from the 1980s through the present day. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; has described it as &quot;a hilarious and touching coming-of-age story that will strike a particular nerve among Generation Y.&quot;

In October 2021, he created and hosted the 10-episode limited series podcast &quot;Waiting for Impact&quot; which traces the history of the band Sudden Impact and explores fame in the early 1990s music industry.
As of 2022 he is still an Editor at Large for Esquire. He has a show on Very Local called In Transit, where he talks with celebrities about their experiences traveling on the road.

==Personal life==
Holmes has been in a long-term relationship with musician Ben Wise since the early 2000s.

<doc id="1149835" wikidata="Q216985" url="?curid=1149835" title="Antiparos">
<text>Antiparos (; ; ; is a small island in the southern Aegean, at the heart of the Cyclades, which is less than one nautical mile (1.9 km) from Paros, the port to which it is connected with a local ferry. Saliagos island is the most ancient settlement in the Cyclades, and Despotiko, an uninhabited island in the southwest of Antiparos, is a place of great archaeological importance.

The Community of Antiparos was founded in 1914 and was promoted to a municipality in 2010 with the implementation of the Law &quot;Kallikrates&quot;, under the principle of &quot;each island a municipality&quot;. It occupies an area of 45.182 square km, including the island of Antiparos and Despotiko. It has, according to the 2021 census, 1,265 permanent residents and a density of 28 inhabitants per km². The island&#x27;s economy is based on tourism, fishing, farming and less on agriculture in the plains. It is known for its white houses, cobbled streets and the flowers that thrive in the yards of the houses. It is a tourist resort in the summer for Greeks and European visitors, as well as land investors from the United States.

The main settlement lies at the northeastern tip of the island, opposite Pounda on the main island of Paros, whence a ferry sails for Antiparos harbour. The historical center is located in the Venetian castle of Antiparos, which is connected through the shopping streets in the picturesque coastal street. Other settlements are the resort of St. George in the southwest edge, Soros and Kampos. Beaches in the wider area of the center are Psaralyki, the Sifneiko, Ag Spiridon and the camping beach. Other beaches include: Soros, Glyfa, Apantima, Monastiria.

==Etymology==
The ancient name of the island was &quot;Oliaros&quot;, Later the island was named &quot;Antiparos&quot;, because of its geographical position, being situated opposite (αντί) the nearby island of Paros.

==Geography and topography==

The island of Antiparos is located 0.8 nautical mi (1.5 km) southwest of Paros, separated by the Strait of Antiparos, known as Amfigeio. It lies from the port of Parikia from which the passenger ferry runs. The maximum length of the island is from north to south, while the maximum width reaches . The total area is estimated at . And the highest peak, St. Elias, in the middle of the island, is at 308 m. The main town is called simply Antiparos.
Antiparos is a volcanic rock and dry climate with high moisture, and morphology favors the development of strong winds. The flowers thrive in the region are mainly bougainvillea that adorn the gardens, houses and shops. The morphology of Antiparos is characterised essentially flat, with many small hilly peaks, while the vegetation of the island is low.
The island of Antiparos is surrounded by many small uninhabited islands with great historical and archaeological interest, such as Tsimintiri the Round, the Double, snow, Revmatonisi, the Red and Black Tourlos. Particularly well known in the international community is Despotiko, an uninhabited island west of Antiparos, where in recent years excavations of great archaeological importance have been carried out.

==Economy==
The island economy is based largely on tourism: the income from visits to the Cave of Antiparos form a very big part of the budget of the municipality. Most people work in the shops, restaurants and accommodation on the island during the tourist season from Easter to October, with the remainder funded by the Employment Service, or undertaking technical and manual jobs. The island&#x27;s economy is also helped by agriculture and animal husbandry, and fisheries.
Since the 1970s and 1980s, Antiparos has become a popular holiday destination, particularly for nudists, attracted by the remote and sandy beaches. The best known is the Camping, or Theologians beach, at the north of the island, opposite the uninhabited island of Diplo. The far end of the town beach is also nudist, as is the Perigiali beach. However most of the other beaches on Antiparos are textile. Since the 1990s there has been a steady development due to its proximity to Paros, and the infrastructure has been improved to accommodate the growing influx of tourists.

==Archaeology==
There are extensive Neolithic remains on the island. It seems the first excavations were those made by the traveller Theodore Bent, with his wife Mabel, in early 1884, opening up some 40 graves in two cemeteries. In 1889 Christos Tsountas excavated in Despotiko, revealing Cycladic cemeteries. From 1964-5 a Neolithic settlement was excavated on the island of Saliagos by Colin Renfrew and J D Evans for the British School at Athens. Stone foundations of buildings, obsidian arrowheads and pottery were found, together with a marble figurine known as the Fat lady of Saliagos.

Classical remains are concentrated on the island of Despotiko. The Isle of Antiparos was identified with ancient Prepesintho, according to the extant writings of Strabo and Pliny.

In 1959 Nikos Zafiropoulos began excavations at Zoumparia and Mantra, on the northeast coast, where there were architecturally Doric temples from the ancient times, dating to 500 BC.

In 1997, the archaeologist Yiannos Kourayos began new excavations at Mantra, bringing to light some of the ancillary buildings of a sanctuary. The temple itself has not so far been discovered, though a number of architectural elements from an early Doric temple have been discovered built into later walls. The main finding so far has been an elongated building, consisting of five consecutive parallel rooms. In the southern room archaic materials of Eastern Aegean, Rhodian, Cypriot and Egyptian origin have been discovered.

Many marble sculptures were found, including two archaic kouros heads, a naked male statue, part of the Archaic period perirrantiriou inscribed with the inscription &quot;Marda anethiken&quot;. Among the significant findings include the built-square marble altar dedicated to Hestia Isthmus of classical times and which is testimony to one of the deities worshiped in the Cyclades.

==History==

The island, under the name Oliarus or Oliaros, was noted by several ancient authors including Pliny the Elder, Strabo, Virgil, and Stephanus of Byzantium. According to Heraclides Ponticus, it was colonised by Sidonians.

During Byzantine times and down to the 13th century, information about the history of Antiparos is scarce. However, in 1207, Antiparos was seized by the Venetian nobleman Marco I Sanudo, and it remained under the house of Sanudo down to the second half of the 14th century, when it passed to the House of Sommaripa. It then passed to the House of Loredan, with Giovanni Loredan building the Castle of Antiparos in 1440 and bringing inhabitants to the island at his own expense. In 1480 it passed to the Venetian house of Pisani.
The Venetian episode came to an end in 1537, during the reign of lady Adriana Crispo, when Antiparos and the rest of the Cyclades fell to the Ottomans, and it remained under Ottoman rule until the Greek War of Independence in 1821, apart from a period of the Orlov Revolt in 1770–74 when it was ruled by the Russians, who removed many of the magnificent stalactites from the cave to the Hermitage Museum in Russia.

The major catastrophe was in 1794, when Kefalonians and Mani pirates arrived on the island and plundered, and kidnapped the daughter of the Venetian vice-Consul.

The Antiparians were among the first in the Cyclades to take part in the War of Independence and in 1832 officially became part of the Greek state.

During World War II, the southwestern tip of the island near the Agios George, was used as a secret submarine base, but after the war it became once more a tranquil place, though now growing as a tourist village.

Antiparos was known to the wider Greek public in 1960 and through the Greek cinema, where workshops hosted by Finos Films in the heart of the movie &quot;Madalena&quot; by helping to enhance its natural beauty and historical landscape. Since then, the island became a tourist destination for Greek and foreign tourists in the summer and the economy of the town started oriented tourism development.

==Architecture==

The architecture, like all the Cycladic islands, requires strict regulations to preserve the uniformity of the Cyclades, which is composed of the typical white houses with blue doors and windows, yard and gardens decorated with bougainvillea and other flowers. Often these characteristics are consistent with the existence of stone or alleys of the neighborhood or the fences of the churchyard.

The castle was built in 1440 by Giovanni Loredan and seems to have a very specific and unique style of architecture. The houses form a compact complex with 24 two-story houses forming the outer zone, while at the centre there is a motte or mound, till recently occupied by a water reservoir. Among the houses there are three churches and the old aqueduct. The houses have mostly been turned round to face outwards where they act as shops.

==Sights==
In the center of the island is the cave of Antiparos, one of the most beautiful and mysterious caves in the world. The cave has been used as a natural shelter from the Neolithic period onwards. The area was also used for pottery, and for the worship of the goddess Artemis, while at the entrance to the site is the church of Agios Ioannis Spiliotis.
Signs and scratches on the stalactites and stalagmites attest to the passers, as the inscription on the altar of the generals of Alexander the Great and King Otto.

===The cave of Antiparos===
The cave is very extensive, and extends at several levels. 
The lyric poet Archilochus of Paros is said to have left an inscription in the cave. In 1673, marquis de Nointel, French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, visited the cave for three days with numerous companions and celebrated mass on Christmas Day in it. Later visitors who carved their names include Lord Byron and the first modern King of Greece, Otto.
During the German occupation, part of the cave was destroyed.
The cave was renovated extensively in the second half of the 20th century, using funds from the EU by erecting barriers, building adequate steps, installing lighting, security cameras and loudspeakers to inform visitors.

===Castle (Kastro) of Antiparos===
The Venetian Castle of Antiparos is a typical example of the fortified settlements established in the Cyclades during the period of the Latins in 13th-16th century. Its construction dates to the mid-15th century when the Venetian Giovanni Loredano decided to marry Mary Sommaripa of Antiparos.

The original version had a ‘motte’ (mound) at the centre and houses round the perimeter. The houses were built as one continuous block construction, the outer walls providing both the defensive wall of the fortified settlement. The only entrance was at the south wing.
Inside the main settlement the houses developed as three-storey structures, each having a separate entrance which leads to an external staircase. In the course of the settlement was extended outside the south wing to form a rectangular ring called &quot;Xopyrga&quot; and within the original enclosure around the base of the circular tower.

In modern times, the original architectural style of the castle has altered, with the church of Christ being inserted as a religious element, while the central mound was used as a water tank tower. Today, the homes retain a satisfactory level of their original features, despite the collapse of the upper floors, and any intervention required permission from the archaeological department. Today most homes are developed in one with two floors and have a maximum ground-like trapdoor. Many now face outwards and have become shops facing onto the main street. 
An integral part of the castle of Antiparos are the small bats that come with dusk and fly around the tower to the east.

==Infrastructure==

The town hall of Antiparos lies with the Multi-alley clinic in a commercial road just in front of the castle, near the Plaza Roussos which took its name from the writer of the film &quot;Madalena&quot;.

Any waste transported to the island a special place in Paros and sewerage and biological treatment have been included in the NSRF to sponsor the Egnatia Odos.

The island has a modern road construction and rehabilitation of the coastal road. The focus of artistic and political events is the stone square of Agia Marina.

The elementary school has a youth club for young people.

==Church==
The Antiparos church belongs to the Bishopric Paronaxia.

<doc id="1149842" wikidata="Q7459973" url="?curid=1149842" title="Shaaron Claridge">
<text>Shaaron Claridge (born Shaaron Lee Cooper; later Snead; October 1, 1938 – September 15, 2021) was an American second-shift radiotelephone operator or police radio dispatcher at the Van Nuys Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) best known for her voice work on the &quot;Adam-12&quot; television series.

Claridge was born in Los Angeles County, California. At the time of her appointment, women were primarily desired as police radio dispatchers because LAPD psychologists thought that women&#x27;s voices would have a more soothing and calming effect over the airwaves. The idea was that, should an officer (male) have been pinned down by gunfire and/or wounded, yet was still within radio contact, hearing the female dispatcher&#x27;s tone would help keep the officer from panicking until back-up arrived at the scene. Her husband was an LAPD motorcycle officer.

For a time from the late 1960s into the late 1970s, Claridge was a voice actress credited with primarily providing police dispatch voice work for &quot;Adam-12&quot; and also a few other television shows (i.e., &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;). Her voice work as the police dispatcher (&quot;1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the man . . .&quot;) was featured in all but three episodes of &quot;Adam-12&quot; (&quot;Elegy for a Pig&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Division&quot; and &quot;Clinic on Eighteenth Street&quot;). She was seen onscreen once in her role as a dispatcher in the fifth-season episode &quot;Suspended&quot; in which she has a brief conversation with Officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner).

However, it appears that certain steps were taken to ensure that she would not be recognized, such as the camera angles used in the sequence: when Milner first walks into the room, the camera is across the room and only her left profile is seen at a distance. But for the close-up, the camera is positioned above Claridge&#x27;s head, over her left shoulder, and aimed down and diagonally to make it hard for the viewer to make out much in the way of her facial features. 

In the 1983 suspense/action movie &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, starring Roy Scheider, Claridge&#x27;s voice was again heard as an LAPD dispatcher in an uncredited role. She also voiced police dispatch in the 1970 Disney film &quot;The Boatniks&quot;.

Following Milner&#x27;s death on September 6, 2015, Claridge broadcast the &quot;End of Watch&quot; transmission over the LAPD radio recognizing Milner&#x27;s performance as Officer Pete Malloy in &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

==Marriages==
On January 12, 1963, she married Frank Walter Claridge. That marriage was later dissolved. On March 17, 1980, she wed Rodney Snead, to whom she remained married until his death.

==Death==
She died at age 82 of complications from liver cancer at Minden, Nevada, on September 15, 2021.

Mizzy was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish immigrants, and attended New York University. As a child, he played accordion and piano, and was largely self-taught as a composer. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy where he wrote some of his hit songs.

== Songwriting ==
In the late 1930s, while based in New York City, Mizzy began composing a string of popular songs. These included Doris Day&#x27;s 1945 hit &quot;My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time&quot;. Other Mizzy compositions were &quot;There&#x27;s a Faraway Look in Your Eye&quot; and &quot;Three Little Sisters&quot;, both co-written with lyricist Irving Taylor. The latter were sung by the Andrews Sisters on Decca Records and in the 1942 Universal film &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot;, in which the sisters appeared with Harry James&#x27; big band.

Dinah Shore also recorded &quot;Three Little Sisters&quot;; &quot;Take It Easy&quot; (also with lyricist Taylor), &quot;Pretty Kitty Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Whole World Is Singing My Song&quot;, &quot;Choo&#x27;n Gum&quot; (recorded by the Andrews Sisters, as well as Teresa Brewer), &quot;The Jones Boy&quot;, which was a 1953 hit for the Mills Brothers, and &quot;With a Hey and a Hi and a Ho-Ho-Ho&quot;.

=== Film and television ===
Mizzy broke into television circa 1959, composing music for &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot; and the themes for &quot;Moment of Fear&quot;, &quot;Klondike&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;. During the 1960s, he wrote themes and scores for the hit shows &quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, as well as for other sitcoms, including &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot;, &quot;The Double Life of Henry Phyfe&quot;, &quot;Captain Nice&quot;, &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot;, and &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;, and the 1964–1965 comedy drama &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;.

A soundtrack album was released in 1965 containing all his compositions from &quot;The Addams Family&quot; entitled &quot;Original Music From The Addams Family&quot;. The single of the theme reached #25 on Canada&#x27;s CHUM Charts. Mizzy rewrote and conducted &quot;The Addams Family Theme&quot; with a slightly different melody for the 1977 television special &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;, which reunited most of the original cast of the 1964–1966 TV series.

He also wrote the scores for five Don Knotts films, including &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; (1966), &quot;The Reluctant Astronaut&quot; (1967), &quot;The Shakiest Gun in the West&quot; (1968) (released on CD by Percepto in 2007), &quot;The Love God?&quot; (1969) and &quot;How to Frame a Figg&quot; (1971), releasing scores on a Compact Disc companion to some of their DVD releases.

His other film work includes the scores for the William Castle films &quot;The Night Walker&quot; (1964), &quot;The Busy Body&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Spirit Is Willing&quot; (1967), as well as other 1960s movies such as &quot;A Very Special Favor&quot; (1965), &quot;The Caper of the Golden Bulls&quot; (1967), &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; (1967), &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1967) and &quot;Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady?&quot; (1968)

He also composed underscores for the television series &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, as well as for such television films as &quot;The Deadly Hunt&quot; (1971), &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1974), &quot;Terror on the 40th Floor&quot; (1974), &quot;The Million Dollar Rip-Off&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Munsters&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1981). Toward the end of his career, Mizzy was commissioned by film producer Sam Raimi to compose music for the outtakes (gag reel) special features for the DVD releases of the films &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Mizzy had two children with his first wife, Mary Small, who as a 1930s child singer had been known as &quot;The Little Girl With The Big Voice,&quot; and who remained popular (especially on radio) through the 1950s. One of her daughters, Patty Keeler, a singer and songwriter, often worked with songwriter Doc Pomus.

Mizzy died at his home in Bel Air, California, on October 17, 2009, aged 93. He was interred at Eden Memorial Park in Mission Hills, California.

<text>Edwin John Ellis (1848–1916) was a British poet and illustrator. He is now remembered mostly for the three-volume collection of the works of William Blake he edited with W. B. Yeats. It is now criticised, however, for weak scholarship, and preconceptions.

==Life==
Ellis was a son of Alexander John Ellis. He was a long-term friend of John Butler Yeats, sharing an interest in aesthetics, and from 1869 a London studio in Newman Street; but was not on good terms with Susan his wife.

Ellis was in an association with John Trivett Nettleship, and Sydney Hall, also followers of Blake, as well as John Butler Yeats and George Wilson (1848–1890, a Scottish Pre-Raphaelite inspired artist). Called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;, the group was set up in 1869, with Hall leaving early.

When the Yeats family moved to Bedford Park in London, which occurred in 1879, Ellis met the son William Butler Yeats. W. B. Yeats became close to the &quot;vague and depressive&quot; Ellis in 1888. Their joint study of Blake began in 1889, and resulted in a major textual discovery, the manuscript of &quot;Vala, or the Four Zoas&quot;.

Ellis took part in the gatherings of the Rhymers&#x27; Club, and contributed to their anthologies. R. F. Foster describes his relationship to W. B. Yeats as that of a collaborator, repaid as other rhymers or mentors were by inclusion in Yeats&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935&quot;.

==Works==
*&quot;Fate in Arcadia, and other poems&quot; 1892 
*&quot;Facsimile of the original outlines before colouring of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience executed by William Blake&quot; 1893
*&quot;The works of William Blake, poetic, symbolic and critical&quot; 1893 (with W B Yeats)
*&quot;Seen in Three Days&quot;, 1893
*&quot;The Real Blake; a portrait biography&quot;, 1907
*&quot;Sancan the Bard&quot;

==Family==
Ellis was married, with a German wife who died around 1922.

<text>Batıkent () is a city near Ankara, Turkey. It is a suburban residential area located west of the city, and Ankara&#x27;s largest suburb. The population is approximately 200,000, mainly middle-class families; it is a popular residential area for students and government workers. The dominant dwelling types are semi-detached and detached houses, and apartment buildings.

Batıkent was created as a cooperative housing project by Kent-Koop (Union of Batikent Housing Construction Cooperatives) to improve the quality of life for low and middle income people, mostly civil servants, traders, etc. The 1995 estimated cost of this project was approximately 43 billion dollars.

Batikent was the first mass housing project to demonstrate the success of public and private partnerships in the housing field in Turkey. It was a pioneer in bringing low income people together in cooperatives, either by place of work or through the workers&#x27; unions, to decide for themselves about the type, size and number of units in their housing projects. Housing &quot;by the people and for the people&quot; has affected the housing shortage in Turkey and has depressed the sale and rental prices in the Ankara housing market.

<text>In personal computing, a tower unit, or simply a tower, is a form factor of desktop computer case whose height is much greater than its width, thus having the appearance of an upstanding tower block, as opposed to a traditional &quot;pizza box&quot; computer case whose width is greater than its height and appears lying flat.

Compared to a pizza box case, the tower tends to be larger and offers more potential for internal volume for the same desk area occupied, and therefore allows more hardware installation and theoretically better airflow for cooling. Multiple size subclasses of the tower form factor have been established to differentiate their varying sizes, including full-tower, mid-tower, midi-tower, mini-tower, and deskside; these classifications are however nebulously defined and inconsistently applied by different manufacturers.

Although the traditional layout for a tower system is to have the case placed on top of the desk alongside the monitor and other peripherals, a far more common configuration is to place the case on the floor below the desk or in an under-desk compartment, in order to free up desktop space for other items. Computer systems housed in the horizontal &quot;pizza box&quot; form factor—once popularized by the IBM PC in the 1980s but fallen out of mass use since the late 1990s—have been given the term &quot;desktops&quot; to contrast them with &quot;towers&quot; that are often situated under the desk.

==Subclasses==

Tower cases are often categorized as &quot;mini-tower&quot;, &quot;midi-tower&quot;, &quot;mid-tower&quot;, &quot;full-tower&quot;, and &quot;deskside&quot;. The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers.

===Full-tower ===

Full-tower cases, typically or more in height, are designed for maximum scalability. For case modding enthusiasts and gamers wanting to play the most technically challenging video games, the full-tower case also makes for an ideal gaming PC case because of their ability to accommodate extensive water cooling setups and larger case fans. Traditionally, full-tower systems had between four and six externally accessible half-height 5.25-inch drive bays and up to ten 3.5-inch drive bays. Some full-tower cases included locking side-doors and other physical security features to prevent theft of the discs inside those bays. However, as modern computing technology has moved away from mechanical hard drives and optical drives toward solid-state devices such as USB flash drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), large-capacity external storage, and cloud storage, such an abundance of internal and external drive bays is less common. More recent full-tower cases instead only have one or two external drive bays, or none at all, with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to free up room and improve airflow.

Full-tower cases readily fit full-size ATX motherboards but may also accommodate smaller microATX motherboards due to the former standard&#x27;s interoperability in mounting holes. Full-tower cases may also have increased dimensional depth and length over their shorter counterparts, allowing them to accommodate Extended ATX motherboards, larger graphics cards and heat sinks. Since the 2010s, full-tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece cases with custom water cooling, RGB LED lighting, and tempered glass or acrylics side panel. They may also hold two motherboards (as is the case with the Corsair 1000D) and dual power supplies (Corsair 900D).

===Mid-tower ===
Mid-tower cases, usually between and in height, are the most common form factor of personal computer towers. Before the late 2010s, mid-towers contained between three and four 5.25-inch drive bays and an equivalent number of 3.5-inch bays to house optical disc drives, floppy disk drives and hard disk drives, leaving just enough room for a standard ATX motherboard and power supply unit. Since the widespread adoption of USB flash drives, solid-state drives (which take up far less space than spinning hard disk drives) and the declining usage of internal optical drives, the number of drive bays has become less of a concern to the contemporary computer user, the internal space of mid-towers is now used more commonly for closed-loop water coolers, dual graphics cards, and tightly stacked SSDs.

===Midi-tower ===
The marketing term &quot;midi-tower&quot; sometimes refers to cases smaller than a mid-tower but still larger than a mini-tower (see below), typically with two to three external bays. Other times the term may be synonymous with &quot;mid-tower&quot;.

===Mini-tower ===
Mini-tower cases, between and in height, slot between the Mini-ITX specification for small-form-factor PCs and the archetypal mid-tower. Mini-towers typically will only accommodate microATX motherboards and for this reason sell in fewer numbers in the consumer market than the other size classes of computer towers. Traditionally, mini-towers had only one or two disk drive bays (either 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch).

===Deskside===

The term &quot;deskside&quot; is primarily a term of art in the workstation market, referring to computer towers with a much wider footprint than traditional domestic tower units. These wider deskside cases accommodate a far greater amount of central processing units (CPUs), drive bays, memory slots, expansion slots, peripherals, and I/O adapters, among other devices.

==History==

The tower form factor may be seen as a proportional miniaturization of mainframe computers and minicomputers, some of which comprise massive tall enclosures standing almost to the ceiling. In the advent of the microcomputer era, most systems were configured with the keyboard built into the same chassis that the main system circuit board resides. Such computers were also termed &quot;home computers&quot; and counted such popular systems as the Apple II, TRS-80, VIC-20, and Commodore 64, among others. In 1981, IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer, a system which was met widespread adoption in both enterprises and home businesses within a couple years and set a new &quot;de facto&quot; standard for the physical configuration of microcomputers. The IBM PC and successors housed the system board and expansion cards in a separate horizontal unit, with the keyboard usually in front and the prescribed CRT monitor resting on top of the system unit; the front of the system unit houses one or more disk drives.

In 1982, NCR introduced the Tower series of workstation computers, named so for their tall, upright configuration, intended to be stowed away under a desk. The first, the Tower 1632, is 29 inches tall and featured a Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Costing upwards of $12,500, the 1632 is meant to run Unix and supports up to 16 simultaneous networked users. NCR continued adding to the Tower line into the late 1980s.

In 1983, Tandy Corporation offered their Tandy 2000 with an optional floor stand, turning the normally horizontal desktop case on its side and allowing it to be stashed under-desk; the square badge on the Tandy 2000 can be removed and rotated upright in turn. IBM followed suit with their PC/AT in 1984, which included an optional &quot;floor-standing enclosure&quot; for $165. Of the three initial entrants in the company&#x27;s RT PC line in 1986, two were tower units, while the other was a traditional horizontal case like the AT and the PCs before it.

In 1987, IBM introduced the PS/2 Model 60, an initial entry in the company&#x27;s Personal System/2 line of personal computers. It was IBM&#x27;s first Intel-based PC built entirely into a tower case. The PS/2 Model 60 was comparable in technical specification to its sibling the PS/2 Model 50, which sported a horizontal desktop form factor. Whereas the Model 50 had only four expansion slots and three drive bays, however, the Model 60 featured eight expansion slots and four drive bays. Because of the latter&#x27;s increased potential for connectivity and multitasking, technology journalists envisioned the PS/2 Model 60 as a multiuser machine, although multiuser operating systems supporting the 80286 processor of both the Models 50 and 60 were hard to come by in 1987. IBM followed up with the tower-based PS/2 Model 80 later that year, their first PC powered by an i386 processor.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1988, the PS/2 Models 60 and 80 started the trend of computer manufacturers offering IBM PC compatibles in optional tower form factors:

Aftermarket floor stands, allowing existing horizontal desktop computers to be stored upright on the floor, were sold in the late 1980s by companies such as Curtis Computer Products. Recommending such kits in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1989, Brit Hume called the tower the best configuration for ergonomics and noted that, &quot;Contrary to popular myth, standing vertically will not hurt the computer or throw off your disk drives.&quot;

The transition in dominance from horizontal desktop computers to towers was mostly complete by 1994, according to a period article in &quot;PC Week&quot;. Computer cases or pre-built systems offered in the traditional horizontal form factor have since been separately categorized as &quot;desktops&quot;, to contrast them with the usually-floor-situated towers.

Brian Benchoff of &quot;Hackaday&quot; argued that the popularity of the Macintosh Quadra 700 was the turning point for computer manufacturers to move over to the tower form factor en masse. The tower form factor of the Quadra 700 was by necessity: common peripherals of the Quadra were the relatively extremely heavy color CRT monitors offered by Apple (those whose screens measured 20 inches and over diagonally could weigh 80 lbs or more) favored by the desktop publishing industry during the 1990s. Such monitors threatened to crush the plastic frames of the Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci; customers might have been tempted to fit such heavy monitors atop the IIcx and IIci because of their horizontal form factor.

<text>Robert Raymond Reid (September 8, 1789 – July 1, 1841) was the fourth territorial governor of Florida. Earlier in his career he was a Representative from Georgia and held several judicial positions.

Robert Reid was born in Prince William Parish, Beaufort District, South Carolina, in 1789. He was educated at the University of South Carolina and studied and practiced law in Augusta, Georgia. Reid began public service at age 27 as a judge and later served Georgia as an at-large Representative from Georgia to the 15th, 16th, and 17th United States Congresses and served from February 18, 1819, to March 3, 1823. He also held several judicial positions including judge in the superior court of Georgia, circuit court judge for Middle Georgia, city judge for Augusta, Georgia. In May 1832, he was appointed United States judge for the district of East Florida by U.S. President Andrew Jackson.

Reid&#x27;s life was marked by personal tragedy. He married three times, was widowed twice and lost numerous children and grandchildren. With his first wife Anna Margaret McClaws, whom he married in 1811, Reid had five children: Janet, James, Florida, Rosalie, and Robert Raymond III. Anna Margaret McClaws died in 1825. Children Janet and James both drowned in a sailing accident in 1839. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Napier D. Randolph in 1829. She died in childbirth in 1832. In 1836, he married Mary Martha Reid, who later became known for her nursing work during the American Civil War. They had two sons, William and Reymond &quot;Jenks.&quot;

U.S. President Martin Van Buren appointed Reid governor of Florida in December 1839. Reid presided at the convention that drafted Florida&#x27;s first constitution and advocated a vigorous prosecution of the Second Seminole War.

He died at his home in Blackwood near Tallahassee, Florida, on July 1, 1841, a victim of a yellow fever epidemic. His granddaughter Rebecca Black and her daughter Janet Black were also victims of the 1841 yellow fever epidemic that struck Florida&#x27;s Panhandle.

<doc id="1149875" wikidata="Q3482092" url="?curid=1149875" title="Castle Shikigami 2">
<text>is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Alfa System for the Sega NAOMI arcade system board. It was subsequently ported in Japan to GameCube, and then later to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 2 by XS Games as &quot;Castle Shikigami 2&quot;, and in Europe as Castle Shikigami 2: War of the Worlds. XS Games also published the first game in the series in North America and Europe under the name &quot;Mobile Light Force 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game mechanisms are generally carried over from the original &quot;Shikigami No Shiro&quot;, with the addition of more playable characters. The game consists of five stages, each with two parts, with a boss at the end of each part. At the end of each stage, dialogue between the player character(s) and the bosses are shown in cut scenes, a unique sequence of dialogue is shown for every different character or combination of two characters.

Each character has a primary weapon, used by tapping or holding one firing button; holding the button for more than a few seconds, however, will switch to the character&#x27;s secondary &quot;Shikigami&quot; weapon. This tends to be more powerful, but limited in range or utility, and also slows character movement. Each character&#x27;s weapons are different, sometimes dramatically, in terms of pattern and power; in addition, each Shikigami weapon is available in one of two modes, chosen at the start of each new game. Bombs are also available, and each character&#x27;s bombs function differently as well.

The leveling up of weapons from the original game is the only mechanic eliminated in the sequel. Five difficulty levels are available, for both the regular game and the &quot;extreme mode&quot;, in which enemies release additional fire when destroyed.

An alternate soundtrack, &quot;S2MIX&quot;, consisting of rearranged music tracks from the first game, is also available; the original soundtrack has been completely replaced with brand new tracks in the PAL PS2 release, for undisclosed reasons.

===Tension Bonus System===
As with many shooters, the game places emphasis on obtaining high scores, which is facilitated by the Tension Bonus System (TBS). The TBS causes a player&#x27;s score received to multiply, by factors of up to eight times, based on the player character&#x27;s proximity to enemy bullets or enemies themselves; this is characteristic of the &quot;grazing&quot; mechanics found in games of the bullet hell genre. By staying close to hazardous objects, multipliers can be maintained for extended periods of time. In addition, destroyed enemies release coins that give extra points, which are also affected by the multiplier.

The player&#x27;s weapons also play a part in the TBS; when the multiplier is at maximum, the primary weapon increases in power and range for as long as this is maintained. In addition, coins released by enemies destroyed with the Shikigami weapon are automatically collected.

==Plot==

The events of the game are set in December 2006. A ship-shaped castle known as Nejireta castle appears 40km in the sky above Tokyo. The battle between mankind and the gods is about to begin.

===Characters===
The game includes eight playable characters, including all five from the original; however, the secret character from the original has been removed:
* Kohtarou Kuga (玖珂 光太郎)
* Sayo Yuhki (結城 小夜)
* Gennojo Hyuga (日向 玄乃丈)
* Fumiko O.V. (Odette Vanstein) (ふみこ・オゼット・ヴァンシュタイン)
* Kim Dae-jeong (金 大正)

The two new characters are:
* Niigi G.B. (Gorgeous Blue) (ニーギ・ゴージャスブルー)
* Roger Sasuke (ロジャー・サスケ)

The super deformed Fumiko also exists as a secret character.

==Release==
Due to the disparity in publishers, as well as release times, each port of the game has different cover artwork, and some releases contained additional content as well. The limited edition of the Dreamcast port included a soundtrack CD and trading cards (and even a telephone card with direct orders from Sega), the limited edition of the PlayStation 2 port included a figurine of Fumiko, and the limited edition of the GameCube port included a figurine of Niigi and Neko, her cat. The North American release used original cover artwork based on the Japanese character designs, while the European release used yet another original image depicting an aerial dogfight.

Within the game, new play modes were also introduced with new releases. New features added following the arcade version include story recollect mode, which allows cut scenes to be replayed, and gallery mode, a game artwork viewer. The Xbox port introduced practice mode, and, in a more significant addition, provided additional downloadable artwork and an online scoreboard that could be available through Xbox Live; this was one of the first examples of Xbox Live content exclusive to Japan, rather than North America.

The American release, &quot;Castle Shikigami 2&quot;, was known for its Engrish dialogue, produced as a result of overly literal translation combined with stilted and generally unemotional voice acting. The dialogue for every character and two-character combination was dubbed into English, though exclamations made by characters during gameplay were not translated. Dialogues are not available at all in the PS2 PAL release.

An English version with an updated translation was developed by Alfa System and Cosmo Machia and released by Degica Games for Windows via Steam on December 6, 2021 as Castle of Shikigami 2. It was released for Nintendo Switch on April 13, 2023.

==Other media==
A number of tie-in novels and manga volumes were produced, expanding the story of the game:

*Novels:
** 玖珂家の秘密 (&quot;Secret of Kuga House&quot;) (2003, )
** 陽の巻 (&quot;Book of Light&quot;) (2003, )
** 陰の巻 (&quot;Book of Shade&quot;) (2003, )
** &quot;Paradise Typhoon&quot; (2004, )
*Manga anthologies
** Anthology 1 (2003, )
** Anthology 2 (2004, )

Magazine ZKC&quot; serialization compilations:
** Book 1, volume 1 (2004, )
** Book 1, volume 2 (2004, )
** Book 1, volume 3 (2005, )
** Book 2, volume 1 (2005, )
** Book 2, volume 2 (2005, )
** Book 2, volume 3 (2006, )
** Book 2, volume 4 (2006, )

Other products released, typical of Japanese video game franchises, include an art book, a standalone soundtrack CD, a set of illustrated telephone cards, plastic models of two of the characters, and the &quot;Appreciate DVD&quot;, a disc of gameplay footage similar in concept to the Ikaruga Appreciate DVD.

==Legacy release of &quot;Shikigami No Shiro: Nanayozuki Gensoukyoku&quot;, a spin-off adventure game in the visual novel style with shooting elements, as well as the arcade release of the proper sequel, &quot;Castle of Shikigami III&quot;, which expands the roster to nine or ten playable characters while removing two old characters.

<doc id="1149883" wikidata="Q2672123" url="?curid=1149883" title="New Covenant">
<text>The New Covenant () is a biblical interpretation which was originally derived from a phrase which is contained in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31–34), in the Hebrew Bible (or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible). Generally, Christians believe that the promised New Covenant—new relationship with God—was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist, which, in the Gospel of John, includes the New Commandment. 

Based on the biblical passage which reads that, &quot;For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth&quot;, Protestants tend to believe that the New Covenant only came into force with the death of Jesus Christ. The commentary to the Roman Catholic New American Bible also affirms that Christ is the &quot;testator whose death puts his will into effect&quot;. Thus, Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and they also believe that the blood of Christ, which was shed during his crucifixion, is the only blood sacrifice which is required by the covenant.

There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant. For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, it will also be in fruition in the future external world. The description of the connection between the blood of Christ and the New Covenant is contained in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as the passage which reads: &quot;this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot;.

==Christianity==
The key New Testament chapter for the Christian concept of the New Covenant is Hebrews 8, a portion of which is quoted below:
That full quotation, with partial quotations of the same text in other New Testament passages, reflects that the authors of the New Testament and Christian leaders generally, consider Jeremiah 31:31–34 to be a central Old Testament prophecy of the New Covenant. Here is the key text:

Some Christians claim that there are many other passages that speak about the same New Covenant without using this exact wording. Some passages speak of a &quot;covenant of peace&quot;, others use other constructions; some simply say &quot;covenant&quot;, but the context may imply that the New Covenant is at issue; and some claim metaphorical descriptions, for example that &quot;Mount Zion&quot; is really a metaphor for the New Covenant.

===New Testament texts===
The occurrence of the phrase &quot;new covenant&quot; varies in English translations of the Greek New Testament. The King James Version sometimes uses &quot;testament&quot; for &quot;covenant&quot;, with the words &quot;new covenant&quot; together occurring in Hebrews , and while in the New International Version &quot;new covenant&quot; occurs at , , , , and as a translation of some form of and or .

Luke 22:17–20 (part of the Last Supper) is disputed. Six forms of the text have been identified; for example, the Western text-type such as Codex Bezae omit verses 19b–20.

The Daniel 9:27 commentary found in the 1599 Geneva Bible connects the verse with the New King James Version translation of Matthew 26:28. In this interpretation, the angel Gabriel reveals the coming New Blood Covenant of the Messiah, which is the fulfillment of the promise that through Abraham&#x27;s seed all the nations would be blessed. (Galatians 3:16, 26–29)

===Christian view===
Christians view the New Covenant as a new relationship between God and humans mediated by Jesus upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God. Some Protestant theologians teach that the New Covenant also breaks the generational curse of original sin on all children of Adam if they believe in Jesus Christ, after people are judged for their own sins, which is expected to happen with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

Most historic Christian Churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Methodist Churches and Reformed Churches, have traditionally held that law in the Old Covenant has three components: ceremonial, moral, and civil (cf. covenant theology). They teach that while the ceremonial and civil (judicial) laws have been abolished, the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments still continues to bind Christian believers.

Dispensationalist theology, taught by certain denominations such as the Plymouth Brethren, present a view of the nature of Israel is that God&#x27;s promises to Israel are distinct from the Church. The Church, in this present age, is in no way a &quot;spiritual Israel&quot;. Some Christians, however, believe that the Church has inherited and absorbed God&#x27;s promises to Israel, and that Israel is primarily a spiritual nation composed of Jews who claim Jesus as their Messiah, as well as Gentile believers who through the New Covenant have been grafted into the promises made to Israelites. This spiritual Israel is based on the faith of the patriarch Abraham (before he was circumcised) who was ministered by the Melchizedek priesthood, which is understood to be a type for the Christian faith of believing Jesus to be Christ and Lord in the order of Melchizedek. The Apostle Paul says that it is not &quot;the children of the flesh&quot; who are the children of God, but &quot;the children of the promise&quot;. While Christ came as a priest in the order of Melchizedeck, which is to say without precedence, and fulfilled God&#x27;s promise of a Messiah to the entire world whosoever believes, Dispensationalists believe that the body of God&#x27;s promises concerning the future of Israel were to Israel alone, and should not be interpreted as being superimposed on the Church in the present age. God&#x27;s remaining promises to Israel will come to fruition in the Millennium, the 1,000 year reign of Christ on Earth.

===Membership===
Among Christians, there are significant differences on the question of membership in the New Covenant. These differences can be so serious that they form a principal reason for division i.e., denominationalism. Christian denominations exist because of their answer to this question. The first major split is between those who believe that only believers are members of the New Covenant, and (reflecting the idea of the Jewish covenants as national or community covenants) those who believe that believers and their children are members of the New Covenant.

These differences give rise to different views on whether children may be baptised: the credobaptist view and the paedobaptist view. Secondarily, there are differences among paedobaptists as to the nature of the membership of children in the covenant.

===Knowledge of God===
Another difference is between those who believe the New Covenant has &quot;already&quot; substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has &quot;not yet&quot; substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning a member of the New Covenant no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).

This division does not just break down along Jewish v. Christian lines (as the previous difference did). In general, those that are more likely to lean toward the &quot;already view&quot;, or &quot;salvific knowledge view&quot;, are those Christians that do not believe in the indivisible Church (the indivisible Church is a belief of Catholics and Orthodox) and Christians that practice believer&#x27;s baptism, because both believe the New Covenant is more present reality than future reality. Also in general, those that lean toward the &quot;not yet view&quot;, or &quot;complete knowledge view&quot;, practice infant baptism for covenantal reasons, and dispensationalistic Christians (even though they tend to practice believer&#x27;s baptism), because they believe the New Covenant is more future reality than present reality.

===Christian supersessionism===
Supersessionism is the view that the New Covenant replaces, fulfills or completes God&#x27;s prior covenants with the Israelites. The most common alternatives to Supersessionism are abrogation of old covenant laws and dual covenant theology.

Writers who reject the notion of supersessionism include Michael J. Vlach, Walter Brueggemann, Roland Edmund Murphy, and Jacques B. Doukhan.

==Judaism==
The only reference in the Hebrew Bible that uses the wording &quot;new covenant&quot; is found in :

This prophet&#x27;s word refers to the Messianic Age to come (or World to come), in which the eternal Mosaic covenant with Israel will be confirmed. Of this Mosaic covenant between God and Israel the Shabbat is declared to be the sign forever (). The Tanakh describes Shabbat as having the purpose as a &quot;taste&quot; of Olam Haba (the world to come, the Hereafter) following the Messianic Age (the End of Days).

The Jewish view of the mere wording &quot;new covenant&quot; is no more than a renewed national commitment to abide by God&#x27;s laws, similar to the covenants enacted by Asa, Hezekiah, Jehoiada, and Josiah in the later books of the Bible. In this view, the word &quot;new&quot; does not refer to a new commitment that replaces a previous one, but rather to an additional and greater level of commitment.

Because Jews view the Mosaic covenant as applying only to Jews and any New Covenant merely a strengthening of the already existing one, Jews do not see this phrase as relevant in any way to non-Jews. For non-Jews, Judaism advocates the pre-Sinaitic Seven Laws of Noah.

In his 1962 work &quot;The Prophets&quot;, Abraham Joshua Heschel points out that prophecy is not the only instrument of God to change the hearts of Israel, to know that he is God. He tells how the prophet Jeremiah complains that Israel is circumcised in body but &quot;uncircumcised in heart&quot; (9:26), that Jeremiah says &quot;wash your heart from wickedness&quot; (4:14). Heschel analyses that, while the prophet can only give Israel a new word, it is God himself who will give man a new heart: The &quot;new covenant&quot; will accomplish the complete transformation of every individual.

Compare with:

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;″s &quot;New Testament&quot; article states:

It is mentioned several times in the Mishna and Talmud, and had been used extensively in kabbalistic literature due to the gematria value of 135 being equal to the word &quot;HaSinai&quot; (הסיני) in . &quot;Brit&quot; also has the numeric value of 612, which is suggested by some to mean that it is the &quot;first&quot; mitzvah which is true for the Jewish life cycle. The other use is in relationship to the merit of Ruth being an ancestor to King David, with the name again having same gematria as Brit, linking Davidic covenant with that of all previous, since Ruth was a Moabite by birth, and related to Noah also.

==Islam==
The Quran mentions that God has made a new covenant of sorts with the Christians but they &quot;neglected part of it&quot; and were consequently punished for that.

* &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;: Epistle to the Hebrews: &quot;... the Epistle opens with the solemn announcement of the superiority of the New Testament Revelation by the Son over Old Testament Revelation by the prophets (). It then proves and explains from the Scriptures the superiority of this New Covenant over the Old by the comparison of the Son with the angels as mediators of the Old Covenant (), with Moses and Josue as the founders of the Old Covenant (), and, finally, by opposing the high-priesthood of Christ after the order of Melchisedech to the Levitical priesthood after the order of Aaron ().&quot;
