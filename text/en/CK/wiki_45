<text>Ierapetra (; ancient name: ) is a Greek city and municipality located on the southeast coast of Crete.

==History==
The town of Ierapetra (in the local dialect: Γεράπετρο &quot;Gerapetro&quot;) is located on the southeast coast of Crete, situated on the beach of Ierapetra Bay. This town lies south of Agios Nikolaos and southwest of Sitia, and is an important regional centre. With 17,710 inhabitants (in 2021), Ierapetra is the most populous town in the regional unit of Lasithi and the fourth most populous town in Crete. Ierapetra is nicknamed &quot;the bride of the Libyan Sea&quot; because of its position as the only town on Crete&#x27;s southern coast.

===Antiquity===

Ierapetra has retained a prominent place in the history of Crete since the Minoan period. The Greek and later Roman town of Hierapytna was located on the same site as present-day Ierapetra.

In the Classical Age, Hierapytna became the most substantial Dorian city in eastern Crete and was in a continual rivalry with Praisos, the last Minoan city on the island.

In the 3rd century BC, Hierapytna was notorious for piracy and took part in the Cretan War with other Cretan cities, siding with Philip V of Macedon against Knossos and Rhodes.

The city of Gortyn surpassed Hierapytna&#x27;s importance as an independent state when Hierapytna was conquered by the Romans in 67 BC (the last free city in Crete). The Roman conquest of Hierapytna coincided with that of Knossos, Cydonia, and Lato. Today, the remains of the Roman harbour can still be seen in the shallow bay.

=== Medieval era ===
In AD 824, Arab invaders destroyed the city and rebuilt it as a base for pirates.

From the 13th to the 17th centuries, Ierapetra, now known by its present name, became prosperous under the influence of Venice. The Fortress of Kales, built in the early years of Venetian rule and strengthened by Francesco Morosini in 1626 to protect the harbor, is a remnant of this period. Local myth, however, states the Genoese pirate Pescatore built the fortress in 1212. In July 1798, Ierapetra made a small step into world history; Napoleon stayed with a local family after the Battle of the Pyramids in Egypt. The house he occupied still exists.

===Modern era===
During the Ottoman period, a mosque was built in Ierapetra.

Finds from Ierapetra&#x27;s past can be found in the local Museum of Antiquities, formerly a school for Muslim children. The exhibition&#x27;s centerpiece is a well-preserved statue of Persephone.

Present-day Ierapetra consists of two distinct areas, &quot;Kato Mera&quot; and &quot;Pano Mera&quot;. Kato Mera is the old town section located on the southwestern headland. It is characterised by a medieval street layout with narrow alleyways, cul-de-sacs, and small houses, which create a village-like atmosphere. The former mosque and the &quot;house of Napoleon&quot; can be found in this neighborhood, as well as the Aghios Georgios metropolitan church, built in the town center in 1856. Aghios Georgios is considered one of the most innovative churches in Crete. The church&#x27;s ceiling contains many &quot;blind&quot; domes. These domes and the central dome are constructed mainly from cedarwood. Pano Mera is a much larger new town section, containing wider streets and three to four-story houses. Pano Mera is still expanding towards the west, north, and east.

Ierapetra&#x27;s principal shopping street is Koundouriotou. In the central section of Pano Mera, there is a town hall, a museum, a cinema, and a hospital. To the west is the southern headland containing the fortress, a port for fishing boats, and the &#x27;Navmachia&#x27; area, where sea fights among slaves for citizens&#x27; entertainment occurred during the Roman occupation. Further east is a short beach with bars and restaurants, followed by the quay for ferries to Chrissi. Further on lies the main boulevard, which contains hotels, bars, restaurants, and souvenir shops. At its end, a promenade runs parallel to Ierapetra Bay&#x27;s long beach.

The local government has planned the development of a new international port. This plan is being opposed by some citizens who think it will destroy the local environment and scenery. They are supported by Ecocrete.gr, a local environmental tribune.

=== Education ===
In 2003, the Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Marketing and Commerce was opened in Ierapetra. In the wake of the Greek financial crisis, in early 2013, the government had to decide whether to merge or close several schools (in a plan named &quot;Athena&quot; after the Greek goddess of wisdom), including TEI of Marketing in Ierapetra, sparking protests. Around 7,000 people staged a peaceful protest on 8 February 2013 holding candles and torches. Local authorities and local media described the march as &quot;the biggest rally in Ierapetra to date.&quot; On 12 February 2013, the town of Ierapetra witnessed a big protest rally, as thousands of people took to the streets once again, demanding the TEI school to stay in town and the hospital to be upgraded.

=== Health ===
The General Hospital of Ierapetra was set up in 1955 with funds from Cretans who lived in the USA. In 2010, it was announced that, under a government plan for new administrative divisions called &quot;the Kallikratis Project&quot;, the hospital was to be shut down. This sparked an unprecedented wave of protests within the region, as the hospital serves 40,000 people including some from the neighboring prefecture of Agios Nikolaos. The protests culminated in a march that took place on 25 January 2011. Another march from Ierapetra to Iraklion followed on the same day, with over 2,500 people from and around the town taking part. Protests included occupying the building where the Decentralized Administration was located and an outdoor theatrical play performed by the protestors. Following those incidents, it was announced that the authorities had halted the plans to close the hospital, instead funding it with 1 million euros and promising to send more doctors.

However, despite the promises of the government, problems still existed surrounding the inadequate provision of health services and the lack of staff in the only hospital in the region. As a result, a fresh round of protests began on 26 May 2011 with a rally outside the seat of the municipality in Ierapetra. Around 1,000 people came to storm the town hall, protesting the latest additions to the building and demanding hospital upgrades instead. The protest, which is regarded a precedent for the region, lasted for 16 days. A row between the municipal authorities and the commission that advocated the upgrade of the hospital resulted in a stalemate and the prosecution of the people who led the storming of the town hall. The Head of the local church, Evgenios, mediated the negotiations and went to Athens along with the mayor and other officials. Negotiations eventually resulted in an agreement to upgrade the hospital. Following an order by the incumbent mayor, 14 citizens were put to trial for the town hall occupation and were found not guilty on 11 July 2011. It was the first such trial in the town to date. Another protest on 20 July 2011 featured a march from Ierapetra to Iraklion and yet another despite the rain in Heraklion on 29 February 2012.

According to inspectors, the hospital was rated &quot;as an example for other hospitals in regional Greece&quot;. However, it was merged by the government only two months before the June 2012 Greek legislative elections. Over the next few months, the merger caused yet more problems concerning bureaucracy, inadequate food and supplies, and a lack of qualified medical professionals. On 30 January 2013, people staged another protest outside the hospital of Ierapetra. The hospital was at the center of a new rally in Ierapetra which took place on 12 February 2013 and another spreading throughout the prefecture of Lasithi. As a result, on 20 February 2013, thousands of people from Lasithi marched to Selinari, Lasithi, and Iraklion. Following the march, Cretans from Lasithi demanded access to health services, equal to the rest of Crete, and stormed the Regional Health headquarters in Iraklion. The unrest ended on 22 February 2013 following an agreement with officials that TEI schools, hospitals, and facilities would stay in the region.

The situation relapsed in early 2014 and a new rally was held on 7 May 2014. People from Ierapetra went to Heraklion, where they met with Antonios Grigorakis, the Head of the Prefecture in charge of Health, who committed to installing a permanent pathologist in the General Hospital (coming from another hospital in the Prefecture of Lasithi). Three people were injured before the meeting following clashes with the police.

==Ierapetra as a Province==
The province of Ierapetra () was one of the provinces of Lasithi. Its territory corresponded partially with that of the current municipality of Ierapetra. It was abolished in 2006.

==Economy==

The area&#x27;s main economic activities are agriculture in the winter and tourism in the summer. Agricultural production in the area can be divided into two main parts. Whereas olive oil has been produced throughout the municipality since Minoan times at the latest, for the last thirty years large quantities of fruit and vegetables have also been exported. These are grown in plastic greenhouses, which cover an area of 15 square kilometers between the town of Ierapetra and Neos Myrtos. They also exist in Psari Forada in the western part, as well as, to a lesser degree, between the town and Goudouras in the eastern part of the municipality. The greenhouses were introduced by the Dutchman Paul Kuypers. The inhabitants of Ierapetra used to be on average among the richest on Crete due to their greenhouse exports.

Chrysi (Golden) or Gaidhouronisi (Donkey Island) is an uninhabited island some twelve kilometers () off the coast of the town of Ierapetra. It is long and on average one kilometre () wide. On average, the island is above sea level. Kefala, the highest point of the island, is above sea level. The island is known for its white beaches, sand dunes, and forest of pines and junipers. The western tip of the island has some remains of past settlement: a few Minoan ruins and a 13th-century Byzantine chapel dedicated to Agios Nikolaos (Saint Nicholas). The main sources of wealth in the settlement were fishing, salt export, and the export of &quot;porphyra&quot; (Tyrian purple), a scarlet dye made from shells. After the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, the island was abandoned, although it was later used as a hideout.

Nowadays the island is protected as an &quot;area of intense natural beauty&quot;. As camping is forbidden on the island, only day trips are possible. Ferries leave the quay at Ierapetra daily at 10 A.M. and return at 5 P.M. Visitors are not allowed to roam freely over the island, but only on designated paths and some beaches close to the eastern tip of the island. The rocky islet of Mikronisi (Small Island) lies to the east of Chrysi.

<text>Bioinorganic chemistry is a field that examines the role of metals in biology. Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of metalloproteins as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are non-essential, in medicine and toxicology. Many biological processes such as respiration depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of inorganic chemistry. The discipline also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.

As a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry is important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer proteins, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties in biological chemistry. The successful development of truly interdisciplinary work is necessary to advance bioinorganic chemistry.

==Composition of living organisms==
About 99% of mammals&#x27; mass are the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. The organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water. The entire collection of metal-containing biomolecules in a cell is called the metallome.

==History==
Paul Ehrlich used organoarsenic (“arsenicals”) for the treatment of syphilis, demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine, that blossomed with Rosenberg&#x27;s discovery of the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin (cis-PtCl2(NH3)2). The first protein ever crystallized (see James B. Sumner) was urease, later shown to contain nickel at its active site. Vitamin B12, the cure for pernicious anemia was shown crystallographically by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin to consist of a cobalt in a corrin macrocycle.

==Themes in bioinorganic chemistry==
Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry. Major areas include:

===Metal ion transport and storage===
A diverse collection of transporters (e.g. the ion pump NaKATPase), vacuoles, storage proteins (e.g. ferritin), and small molecules (e.g. siderophores) are employed to control metal ions concentration and bio-availability in living organisms. Crucially, many essential metals are not readily accessible to downstream proteins owing to low solubility in aqueous solutions or scarcity in the cellular environment. Organisms have developed a number of strategies for collecting and transporting such elements while limiting their cytotoxicity.

===Enzymology===
Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are metalloproteins. Often the reacting water is a ligand (see metal aquo complex). Examples of hydrolase enzymes are carbonic anhydrase, metallophosphatases, and metalloproteinases. Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the function of these metalloproteins.

Metal-containing electron transfer proteins are also common. They can be organized into three major classes: iron–sulfur proteins (such as rubredoxins, ferredoxins, and Rieske proteins), blue copper proteins, and cytochromes. These electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron transporters nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The nitrogen cycle make extensive use of metals for the redox interconversions.
===Toxicity===
Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed.

===Oxygen transport and activation proteins===

Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese. Heme is utilized by red blood cells in the form of hemoglobin for oxygen transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology. Other oxygen transport systems include myoglobin, hemocyanin, and hemerythrin. Oxidases and oxygenases are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation in cytochrome c oxidase or small molecule oxidation in cytochrome P450 oxidases or methane monooxygenase. Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as hydrogen peroxide. These systems include peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases. A complementary metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the oxygen evolving complex present in plants. This system is part of the complex protein machinery that produces oxygen as plants perform photosynthesis.
===Bioorganometallic chemistry===
Bioorganometallic systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the hydrogenases, FeMoco in nitrogenase, and methylcobalamin. These naturally occurring organometallic compounds. This area is more focused on the utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are significant in environmental chemistry.

===Metals in medicine===

A number of drugs contain metals. This theme relies on the study of the design and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely used anti-cancer drug is cisplatin. MRI contrast agent commonly contain gadolinium. Lithium carbonate has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. auranofin have been commercialized. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules are metal complexes have been developed to suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide. The cardiovascular and neuronal importance of nitric oxide has been examined, including the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. (See also: nitrogen assimilation.) Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been tested against several parasite strains.

===Environmental chemistry===

Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy metals with organisms. Methylmercury has caused major disaster called Minamata disease. Arsenic poisoning is a widespread problem owing largely to arsenic contamination of groundwater, which affects many millions of people in developing countries. The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing compounds involves cobalamin-based enzymes.

===Biomineralization===

Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria (Fe3O4), gravity sensing devices (CaCO3, CaSO4, BaSO4) and iron storage and mobilization (Fe2O3•H2O in the protein ferritin). Because extracellular iron is strongly involved in inducing calcification, its control is essential in developing shells; the protein ferritin plays an important role in controlling the distribution of iron.

==Types of inorganic substances in biology==

===Alkali and alkaline earth metals===

The abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The most important ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate, and bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerves and muscles, as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.

===Transition metals===
The transition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant. These metals are used as protein cofactors and signalling molecules. Many are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. These cofactors are tightly to a specific protein; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, cofactors always return to their original state after catalysis has taken place. The metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bound to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not being used. Cobalt is essential for the functioning of vitamin B12.

===Main group compounds===
Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active. Sulfur and phosphorus are required for all life. Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and its various esters. Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from sulfate (SO42−) down to sulfide (S2−). Selenium is a trace element involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its toxicity.

<doc id="1131068" wikidata="Q5333467" url="?curid=1131068" title="Economic history of Africa">
<text>The earliest humans were hunter gatherers who were living in small, family groupings. Even then there was considerable trade that could cover long distances. Archaeologists have found that evidence of trade in luxury items like precious metals and shells across the entirety of the continent.

African economic history often focuses on explanations of poverty and obscures other aspects such as the achievements of African farmers, traders and states, including improvements in food security, and episodes of economic growth.

==Ancient history==
Africa has the longest and oldest economic history. As soon as human societies came into existence, so did economic activity. Earliest humans were hunter gatherers living in small, family groups. Even then there was considerable trade that could cover long distances. Archaeologists have found that evidence of trade in luxury items like metals and shells across the entirety of the continent were the main trades of the Berber people, lived in dry areas and became nomadic herders, while in the savannah grasslands, cultivated crops and thus permanent settlement were possible. Agriculture supported large towns, and eventually large trade networks developed between the towns.

===Origins of agriculture===
The first agriculture in Africa began around the Sahel and the south of the Sahara Desert, which in 5200 BC was far more moist and densely populated than today. Several native species were domesticated, most importantly pearl millet, sorghum and cowpeas, which spread through West Africa and the Sahel. The Sahara at this time was like the Sahel today. Its wide open fields made cultivation easy, but the poor soil and limited rain made intensive farming impossible. The local crops were also not ideal and produced fewer calories than those of other regions. These factors limited surpluses and kept populations sparse and scattered.

North Africa took a very different route from the southern regions. Climatically it is linked to the Middle East and the Fertile Crescent, and the agricultural techniques of that region were adopted wholesale. This included a different set of crops, such as wheat, barley, and grapes. North Africa was also blessed by one of the richest agricultural regions in the world in the Nile River valley. With the arrival of agriculture, the Nile region became one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and Egypt home to one of the first civilizations.

The drying of the Sahara created a formidable barrier between the northern and southern portions of the continent. Two important exceptions were Nubian Sudan, which was linked to Egypt by the Nile and Ethiopia, which could trade with the northern regions over the Red Sea. Powerful states grew up in these regions such as Kush in Nubia (modern day Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt) and Aksum in Ethiopia. Especially from Nubia, ideas and technologies from the Middle East and Europe reached the rest of Africa.

Historians believe that iron working developed independently in Africa. Unlike other continents Africa did not have a period of copper and bronze working before their Iron Age. Copper is quite rare in Africa while iron is quite common. In Nubia and Ethiopia, iron, trade, and agricultural surpluses lead to the establishment of cities and civilizations.

===The Bantu expansion===
Ordinarily, in the sparsely populated areas, this same period saw the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples. The Bantu expansion began in Southern Cameroon around 4000 years ago. Bantu languages are spoken there today and there is archaeological evidence for incoming Neolithic farmers in Northern Gabon c. 3800 BC. It is known that Bantu expansion was extremely rapid and massive, but its exact engine remains controversial. This period predated iron, which appears in the archaeological record by 2500 BC.

One of the early expansions of Bantu was the migration of the Bubi to Fernando Po (Bioko). They were still using stone technology at first. The difficulties of cutting down the equatorial forest for farming have led to the suggestion that the primary expansion was along river valleys, a hypothesis supported by studies of fish names. Another factor may have been the arrival of southeast-Asian food crops, notably the AAB plantain, the cocoyam and the water-yam. Linguistic reconstructions suggest that the only livestock possessed by the proto-Bantu was the goat. Over the centuries the entire southern half of Africa was covered with the group, excluding only the Kalahari desert. Their expansion only ended relatively recently. In the year 1000, Arab traders described that the Bantu had not reached as far as Mozambique, and European settlers observed the Bantu expansion into South Africa under the Zulu and others, yet there&#x27;s no archaeological evidence that supports their claims instead on the contrary the evidence indicates Bantu speakers&#x27;s presence very much earlier by over 1800 years and over 1400 years before the first European settlement in the South African regions of Mozambique and South Africa respectively.

The importation Bantu pastoralism reshaped the continent&#x27;s economy. Sometime in the first millennium, an equally important change began as crops began to arrive from Southeast Asia. The Indian Ocean has always been far more open to trade than the turbulent Atlantic and Pacific. Traders could ride the monsoon winds west early in the year and return east on them later. It is guessed that these crops first arrived in Madagascar, which also adopted Southeast Asian languages, sometime between AD 300 and 800. From the island, the crops crossed to African Great Lakes region. They included many crops, the most important being the banana.

The banana and other crops allowed for more intensive cultivation in the tropical regions of Africa, this was most notable in the Great Lakes region, an area with excellent soil, that saw many cities and states form, their populations being fed largely

==Trade routes==

While some level of trade had been ongoing, the rise of cities and empires made it far more central to the African economy. North Africa was central to the trade of the entire Mediterranean region. Outside of Egypt, this trade was mostly controlled by the Phoenicians who came to dominate North Africa, with Carthage becoming their most important city. The Greeks controlled much of the eastern trade, including along the Red Sea with Ethiopia. In this region a number of Greek trading cities that were established acted as a conduit for their civilization and learning.

The Egyptian (and later, Roman) city of Alexandria (founded by Alexander the Great in 334 BC), was one of the hubs for Mediterranean trade for many centuries. Well into the 19th century Egypt remained one of the most developed parts of the world.

Nubia in Sudan likewise traded with interior African countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as with Egypt, China, India and the Arabian peninsula.

For most of the 1st millennium AD, the Axumite Kingdom in Ethiopia and Eritrea had a powerful navy and trading links reaching as far as the Byzantine Empire and India. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, the Ajuran Sultanate centered in modern-day Somalia practiced hydraulic engineering and developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.

On the east coast of the continent Swahili traders linked the region into an Indian Ocean trading network, bringing imports of Chinese pottery and Indian fabrics in exchange for gold, ivory, and slaves. Swahili Kingdoms created a prosperous trade empire, where occupied the territory of modern-day Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Swahili cities were important trading ports for trade with the Middle East and Far East.

In the interior of Africa, trade was far more limited. Low population densities made profitable commerce difficult. The massive barrier of the Congo rainforests were more imposing than the Sahara, blocking trade through the center of the continent.

It was the arrival of the Islamic armies that transformed the economies of much of Africa. Though Islam had comparatively little impact on North Africa where large cities, literacy, and centralized states had been the norm, Muslims were far more effective at penetrating the Sahara than Christians had been. This was largely due to the camel, which had carried the Arab expansion and would soon after carry large amounts of trade across the desert.

A series of states developed in the Sahel on the southern edge of the Sahara which made immense profits from trading across the Sahara. The first of these was the Empire of Ghana, reaching it peak in the 12th century. Soon, others such as the Mali Empire and Kanem-Bornu, also arose in the region. The main trade of these states was gold, which was plentiful in Guinea. Also important was the trans-Saharan slave trade that shipped large numbers of slaves to North Africa.

===600–1600 AD===

Many wealthy empires grew around coastal areas or large rivers that served as part of important trade routes. The kingdoms of Mali and Songhai Empire grew along the Niger River between 1200 and 1590. Berber traders from the Sahel—a region south of the Sahara Desert—traded dates, copper, horses, weapons and cloth that they brought from north Africa in Camel trains. Trade with the Berber people, and other groups, drove the growth of the Ghana empire, which traded its gold, kola nuts, and slaves. West Africans created a demand for salt, which was collected at desert oases, and which they used to preserve food as well as for seasoning it.

In 1324, Mansa Musa, the king of Mali, made a historically famous Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca. There was an enormous group organized to undertake the Hajj with the king. It included &quot;60,000 men, including 1200 servants&quot; and records show that Mansa Musa gave out so much gold in Egypt, that its economy became depressed.

Between 1000 and 1500, the forests of West Africa also became part of trade networks, particularly under the reigns of the Yoruba kings. Ifé was a vital trade town, along the route from the tropical forests to Djenné, a major trade centre in Sudan, near other large trade cities such as Timbuktu and Gao. Ifé&#x27;s location also placed it near Benin and the Atlantic Ocean. Yoruba civilization was supported by cities surrounded by farmed land, but extensive trade development made it wealthy.
By 1000, the Bantu language-speaking people of Zimbabwe and Southern Africa developed extensive overseas trade with lands as far away as China and India, from which they received porcelain, beads, and Persian and Arab pots. They traded domesticated beef (rather than meat from game animals), iron, and ivory and gold. The city of Great Zimbabwe, founded around 1100, was the centre of the Shona kingdom until around 1400.

Much trade in the forest kingdoms was done at the local level, typically by ordinary Yoruba people at local markets. In some towns these were held every 3 or 4 days. Cloth, vegetables, meat, and other goods were traded, and paid for using small seashells called cowries which were imported from East Africa. Bars of copper and iron, called &quot;manilas&quot;, were produced in standard shapes to be used as currency. Other items used in trade as a form of currency included salt, cloth, and bars of gold.

Trade with the Middle East had begun as early as ancient Egypt. Islam was introduced to the Horn region early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. Zeila&#x27;s two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century. The spread of Islam brought Arab traders as far as Morocco. The Adal Sultanate in the Horn region also maintained bilateral relations with the Ottoman Empire.
The institutional framework for long-distance trade across political and cultural boundaries had long been strengthened by the adoption of Islam as a cultural and moral foundation for trust among and with traders. 
On the Swahili Coast to the southeast, the Sultan of Malindi sent envoys to the Chinese imperial palace in Nanjing Yongle bearing a giraffe and other exotic gifts.

==European influence==

===Early European colonization===
The earliest European colonists settled in North Africa in ancient times. These colonists included Phoenicians and Greeks. Settlers from ancient Athens and other parts of Greece established themselves along the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. They were later followed by colonists of the Roman Empire. Rome&#x27;s colonies &quot;served as a prototype&quot; for later European colonial movement into the continent.

Portugal was the first European empire to penetrate deep into Sub-Saharan Africa to establish colonies. Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator advanced Portuguese exploration of Africa, driven by two desires: to spread Christianity, and to establish Africa as a bastion of Christianity against the Ottoman Empire, which was making many African converts to Islam. Africa was exploited for commercial purposes because of another Portuguese goal: to find a route to India, which would open the entire Indian Ocean region to direct trade with Portugal. Conquest of territory in Africa also meant that the Portuguese could use African gold to finance travel along this new trade route.

The Portuguese began significant trading with West Africa in the 15th century. This trade was primarily for the same commodities the Arabs had bought—gold, ivory, and slaves. The Portuguese sold the Africans Indian cloth and European manufactured goods but refused to sell them guns. Soon, however, other European powers such as France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain were developing their own trade with Africa, and they had fewer restrictions. The major European imperial powers in Africa were Portugal, Great Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy. Portugal&#x27;s presence in Africa as an imperial power lasted until the 1970s, when the last of its former colonies declared independence after years of war.

The Atlantic Ocean had long been all but impenetrable to the galleys that plied the Mediterranean. That any ship needed to pass thousands of kilometers of waterless desert before reaching any populated regions also made trade impossible. These barriers were overcome by the development of the caravel in Europe. Previously, trade with Sub-Saharan Africa could only be conducted through North African middlemen. Now Europeans could trade directly with the Africans themselves.

This valuable trade lead to rapid change in West Africa. The region had long been agriculturally productive and, especially in western Nigeria, densely populated. The massive profits from trade and the arrival of guns lead to significant centralization and a number of states formed in the region such as the Ashanti Confederacy and Kingdom of Benin. These states became some of the wealthiest and most advanced in Africa. Wealthy merchants began to send their children to European universities and their well armed standing armies could challenge European forces.

Many West-African natives, such as Seedies and Kroomen, served on European ships, and received regular pay, which greatly enhanced their status back home.

===Atlantic slave trade===

The modern historiography of slavery has swung between two poles on the question of its demographic and economic effects on Africa as a whole. Early historical accounts of the Atlantic slave trade were largely written for a popular audience by abolitionists and former slaves like Olaudah Equiano who emphasized its profoundly negative effects on African peoples. As the 19th century progressed, accounts of the negative impact of slavery were increasingly used to argue for European colonization of the continent. Conversely, there were those, like the British explorer and geographer William Winwood Reade, who drew on the accounts of slave traders to argue that the effects of slavery were positive.

By the early 20th century, the view of slavery as a negative influence on Africa prevailed among professional academic historians in Europe and the United States. During the decolonization period following World War II, an influential group of scholars, led by J.D. Fage, argued that the negative effects of slavery had been exaggerated, and that the export of slaves had been offset by population growth. Walter Rodney, a specialist on the Upper Guinea Coast, countered that European demand for slaves had vastly increased the economic importance of the slave trade in West Africa, with catastrophic effects. Rodney, who was active in Pan-African independence movements, accused Fage of whitewashing the role of Europeans in Africa; Fage responded by accusing Rodney of nationalist romanticism.

Debates on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade were further stimulated by the publication of Philip Curtin&#x27;s &quot;The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census&quot; (1969), which argued that 9.566 million slaves were exported from Africa through the Atlantic trade. In the 1970s, the debate on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade increasingly turned on demographic estimates of slave exports in relation to continental birth rates. Most scholars now believe that Curtin was too conservative in his calculation, with most estimates ranging between 11.5 million to 15.4 million. More recently, John K. Thornton has presented an argument closer to that of Fage, while Joseph Inikori, Patrick Manning and Nathan Nunn have argued that the slave trade had a long-term debilitating impact on African economic development.

Manning, for example, arrived at the following conclusion, after accounting for regional variations in slave exports and assuming an annual African population growth rate of 0.5.%: the population of West Africa would have been 100 million rather than ~50 million in 1850, if not for the combined effects of the external and internal slave trades. Nunn, in a recent econometric analysis of slave-exporting regions in all parts of Africa, found &quot;a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves taken from a country and its subsequent economic development.&quot; Nunn argues, moreover, that this cannot be explained by poverty prior to the slave trade, because more densely populated and economically developed parts of Africa regressed behind previously less developed, non-slave exporting areas during the course of the Atlantic, trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades.

==Colonial era==
===1884–1945===
The Berlin Conference (German: Kongokonferenz or &quot;Congo Conference&quot;) of 1884–85 regulated European colonization and trade in Africa during the Imperialism period, and coincided with Germany&#x27;s sudden emergence as an imperial power. Called for by Portugal and organized by Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the Scramble for Africa. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, while simultaneously eliminating most existing forms of African autonomy and self-governance. During this colonial time, the economy of Africa was re-arranged to serve Europe and Europeans, and the European industrial chain began in Africa and ended in European industrial warehouses.

All of Africa would ultimately fall under European colonial rule by 1914, with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia. The partitioning of African territory among European regimes often violated existing boundaries recognized by local Africans. Some of the independent African states affected by the partitioning of the continent included: 

* Al-Hajj Umar Ahmadu Sefu
* Ankole
* Asanti
* Bagirmi
* Barotse
* Basutoland
* Benin Kingdom
* Bornu 
* Buganda
* Bunyoro
* Burundi
* Chokwe
* Dahomey
* Empire of Sokoto
* Jumbe
* Karagwe
* Matabele
* Merina
* Mirambo
* Mlozi
* Morocco
* Msiri
* Rwanda
* Samori
* (Mahdist State of the) Sudan
* Yao Chiefs
* Yoruba State
* Wadai
* (Sultanate of) Zanzibar
* Zulu Empire
Under colonial rule, the plantation system of farming was widely introduced in order to grow large quantities of cash crops, and employing cheap (often forced) African labor for export to European countries. Mining for gems and precious metals such as gold was developed in a similar way by wealthy European entrepreneurs such as Cecil Rhodes. The implementation and effects of these colonial policies could be brutal. One extreme example of exploitation of Africans during this period is the Congo Free State, administered under a form of &quot;company rule&quot;. The Belgians, under Leopold II of Belgium, allowed businesses to use forced labour as they saw fit. The brutal conditions, famine and disease ended in the deaths of an estimated 10 million Congolese between 1885 and 1908.

Belgian government commissions in the 1920s found that the population of Belgian Congo had fallen by as much as 50% under Congo Free State rule as a result of forced labor (largely for the purposes of rubber cultivation), massacre by colonial troops, famine and disease. In white settler colonies like Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa and Southwest Africa (now Namibia), the most fertile lands were forcibly expropriated from the indigenous populations for use by white settlers. In these countries African farmers were pushed onto &quot;native reserves,&quot; usually located on arid, marginal lands. Slavery was also widely abolished by colonial powers.

====Economics====
To some colonizers, such as the British, the ideal colony was based on an open economy, actively engaged in world trade through the export of raw materials and the import of finished goods. The British practiced a policy of light administration, enforcing relatively little regulation on their colonies, especially in non-economic matters. As long as British interests were achieved, native populations were given greater individual freedoms. A great example for this is the British colonial education system. It relied mainly on local resources and languages in education, many missionaries were run by Africans. This resulted in higher numeracy levels in areas that were influenced by British colonial education, and thus an increase in human capital. Other colonizers, such as the French, took a more active approach to governance, encouraging or even requiring their subjects to more fully assimilate into French culture. Many colonial powers centred their education systems around this style of assimilation, focusing their efforts on literary education in an attempt to &#x27;civilise&#x27; rather than assist productivity and develop technical skills.

Colonizers were under heavy political pressure to make their colonies immediately and continuously profitable. In almost all cases, this constraint led to a shortage of long-term investment from the mother countries into the economic development in their colonies. While these countries did finance some major infrastructure projects designed to facilitate trade, this was primarily to aid in the immediate extraction of valuable resources, and there was little to no investment into growing local business. Another reason colonial governments allowed local economies to lag behind was that competitive local industries would have reduced the colonies’ trade dependence on the central economies in Europe. The aim of colonial economics was often to extract the most value out of the existing natural resources within the territory, rather than creating balanced and sustainable economic models. This meant African colonial economies were often export based, with little to no domestic manufacturing, resulting in the aforementioned trade dependence on Europe.

For the colonies to be integrated into the world economy and imperial trade network, the colonial governments needed the local citizens to engage in market activity, rather than simply subsistence agriculture. One method that colonial powers used to urge the native populations into participating in the larger economy was the requirement that taxes be paid in official currency. This made subsistence farming less feasible, as the producers then needed to sell at least some surplus in the market to obtain the currency needed for the payment of taxes. 

Many times colonial powers collected these taxes through the assistance of local African chiefs, who were politically and financially supported by the colonial governments in exchange for their assistance in enforcing these governments’ policies, especially for policies that could be unpopular. Thus, the colonizers themselves avoided some degree of animosity from their subjects by using these established chiefs as proxies to enforce many of their coercive policies.

Today, many African economies are affected by the legacy of colonialism. In agriculture, the plantation systems that they introduced were highly unsustainable and caused severe environmental degradation. For example, cotton severely lowers soil fertility wherever it is grown, and areas of West Africa that are dominated by cotton plantations are now unable to switch to more profitable crops or even to produce food because of the depleted soil. Recently, more countries have initiated programs to change to traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture such as shifting cultivation and bush fallow in order to grow enough food to support the population while maintaining soil fertility which allows agriculture to continue in future generations.

==Independence and the Cold War==
After World War II, European attitudes towards Africa began to change. In the aftermath of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, &#x27;Western&#x27; powers were averse to the idea of using outright conquest to annex territory. At the same time, agitation against colonial rule was becoming persistent in Africa. Between 1945 and 1948 there was a series of strikes and protests, in Senegal, Tanzania, on the French West African railway system, and along West Africa&#x27;s Gold Coast.

African countries gradually won their independence (with colonial-era boundaries intact), in most cases without prolonged violent conflict (exceptions include the Cameroon, Madagascar and Kenya). As the Cold War continued, African governments could count on support from either Western governments or Communist patrons, depending upon their ideology.

The early years of independence went relatively smoothly for most African countries. This economic resilience eroded for the most part over the next several decades. Many arguments have been made to identify factors to explain the economic decline of many African countries. The tendency towards single-party rule, outlawing political opposition, had the result of keeping dictators in power for many years, perpetuating failed policies. Loans from foreign governments became crippling burdens to some countries that had difficulty even paying the interest on the loans. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that between 1970 and 2002 &quot;sub-Saharan Africa received $294 billion in loans, paid out $268 billion in debt service, and yet still owes $300 billion&quot;.

At various points during the late 20th century, the following debts were incurred by African governments (amounts are in billions of US dollars): 
* Nigeria (33)
* South Africa (22)
* Democratic Republic of the Congo (13)
* Sudan (9)
* Ethiopia (8)

By the 1980s, political conflict had erupted into civil war in some countries, and the political instability kept some economies mired for many years. Some African governments faced practical problems in implementing industrial change as they attempted rapid modernization of their economies; costing and mismanagement problems in agricultural, manufacturing, and other sectors meant the failure of many projects. One result was African countries becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign food imports.

A heavy blow to the economies of many African countries came from the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. Arab OPEC member countries opposed Israel during the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. OPEC embargoed oil exports to many Western governments as retaliation for their having supported Israel in the War. 40 African countries were dependent upon oil imports from OPEC, and when the price of oil rose rapidly from the embargo, African exports became too expensive for many foreign markets.

==Poverty==

A major question in the economic history of Africa is focusing on explanations for the relative poverty of the continent. Economists today use different ways to explain this phenomenon usually either an external or internal approach.

;External approach
External approaches usually focus on institutional patterns within economies. They try to explain Africa&#x27;s economic development as subject to European institutional decisions of the past. European colonial governments had no incentive to create institutions fostering economic development in African colonies, but rather economic extraction of given resources. Even today, African institutions still depend on these early decisions. For example, in Africa, property rights are not established or enforced in a way promoting economic activity, and many African nations still rely heavily on raw material exports for income. For instance, in 2008, 75% of Malian exports came from gold. 

;Internal approach
Here two distinct ways have to be differentiated:
The first one, similar to the external approach, focuses on property right distributions in Africa. These usually emerge from the setup of the society, being more collective than individualist with tribes or families playing an important role in Africa. Thereby the distribution of property rights is an obstacle to economic development. Also, there are few incentives to change this setup into an economically more advantageous setting. For rulers it is often the rational choice to stick to this property rights setup, thereby being able to extract more from their dominion than by fostering economic development.
The second internal approach focuses directly on resource endowments within the specific regions. Labor scarcity until the 20th century combined with a relatively low quality of soils lead to an extensive way of farming, largely relying on vast amounts of land rather than on intensive use of labor on the land. Combined with bad institutions from precolonial or colonial times this economic setup hinders the extensive use of technology and thereby slowing down or even preventing economic development.

==Modern era==
The wealthy elite in Africa in the late 20th century was characterized by civil servants functioning as &quot;gatekeepers&quot;, holding positions with authority to approve foreign aid, humanitarian assistance, and private investment (typically foreign). Bribery and corruption became entrenched in some countries. Environmental and political catastrophe combined in several famines during the 1970s and 1980s in Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania and Mozambique. The impact of drought and desertification of a large part of the continent came to widespread public attention by the early 21st century.

Railway projects were important in mining districts from the late 19th century. Large railway and road projects characterize the late 19th century. Railroads were emphasized in the colonial era, and roads in ‘post-colonial’ times. Jedwab &amp; Storeygard find that in 1960–2015 there were strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development. Influential political include pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.

Africa&#x27;s economy only began to take off in the early 2000s as the political situation improved, national governments began to crack down on corruption and patronage, macroeconomic growth plans aimed at improving living conditions began to be implemented, and millions of Africans continued to flock to the cities in search of jobs and other amenities.

 | properties = convex, elementary
 | net = Pentagonal Cupola.PNG

== Properties ==
The pentagonal cupola&#x27;s faces are five equilateral triangles, five squares, one regular pentagon, and one regular decagon. It has the property of convexity and regular polygonal faces, from which it is classified as the fifth Johnson solid. This cupola produces two or more regular polyhedrons by slicing it with a plane, an elementary polyhedron&#x27;s example.

The following formulae for circumradius formula_1, and height formula_2, surface area formula_3, and volume formula_4 may be applied if all faces are regular with edge length formula_5:
formula_6

It has an axis of symmetry passing through the center of both top and base, which is symmetrical by rotating around it at one-, two-, three-, and four-fifth of a full-turn angle. It is also mirror-symmetric relative to any perpendicular plane passing through a bisector of the hexagonal base. Therefore, it has pyramidal symmetry, the cyclic group formula_7 of order ten.

== Related polyhedron ==
The pentagonal cupola can be applied to construct a polyhedron. A construction that involves the attachment of its base to another polyhedron is known as augmentation; attaching it to prisms or antiprisms is known as elongation or gyroelongation. Some of the Johnson solids with such constructions are: elongated pentagonal cupola formula_8, gyroelongated pentagonal cupola formula_9, pentagonal orthobicupola formula_10, pentagonal gyrobicupola formula_11, pentagonal orthocupolarotunda formula_12, pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda formula_13, elongated pentagonal orthobicupola formula_14, elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola formula_15, elongated pentagonal orthocupolarotunda formula_16, gyroelongated pentagonal bicupola formula_17, gyroelongated pentagonal cupolarotunda formula_18, augmented truncated dodecahedron formula_19, parabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron formula_20, metabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron formula_21, triaugmented truncated dodecahedron formula_22, gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_23, parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_24, metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_25, and trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_26. Relatedly, a construction from polyhedra by removing one or more pentagonal cupolas is known as diminishment: diminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_27, paragyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_28, metagyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_29, bigyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_30, parabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_31, metabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_32, gyrate bidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_33, and tridiminished rhombicosidodecahedron formula_34.

<text>Matutano (officially &quot;Matutano Snack Ventures, S.A.&quot;) is a producer and distributor of snacks and potato chips with headquarters in Barcelona, operating the markets of Spain and Portugal (here through its subsidiary &quot;Matutano Unipessoal Lda.&quot;). The company was founded in 1965 by Luis Matutano Jover, and since 1971 is part of multinational Frito Lay.

Currently, Matutano distributes for the Iberian Peninsula PepsiCo snacks as Lays, Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos and Ruffles among other brands.

== History ==
The company originates in the 1950s, when spanish businessman Luis Matutano Jover founded in Barcelona a factory of snacks based on potatoes, a business his family exploited since 1873. Its production level was fairly modest until 1965 when the company&#x27;s owner associated with the food group &quot;Pet Milk&quot; from United States to form the original Matutano brand, with an initial staff of 42 employees and 8 delivery routes. In 1969 the company bought Rick SA, founded by Augusto Aboitiz Baroja, with a production factory in Burgos, and the company started to expand to whole Spain.

In 1971 the multinational Frito Lay, part of PepsiCo, got the whole shares of the company and introduced most of their products in the Spanish market, as Cheetos (1975), Fritos (1976), Boca Bits (1981), Doritos (1984) and Ruffles (1986). In 1975 the characteristic logo of Matutano was adopted, a smiling face, and the company&#x27;s image became popular. During the decades of 1970s and 1980s the company became the leader of Spanish market in potato chips and snacks, and started its expansion in Portugal.

With the arrival of Lays potatoes in 1997, Matutano changed its corporate image of all its products to adopt the Frito Lay logo. But the change was a failure, and in 2009 PepsiCo put back the smiling face as its corporate identity. The company motto is: &quot;Y hoy ¿Has sonreído?&quot; (Have you smiled today?)

<doc id="1131083" wikidata="Q1352734" url="?curid=1131083" title="Gustavo Cisneros">
<text>Gustavo Alfredo Jiménez de Cisneros y Rendiles (1 June 1945 – 29 December 2023) was a Venezuelan businessman and Chairman of &quot;Grupo Cisneros&quot;.

A onetime billionaire, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; his net worth peaked at US$6.0 billion in 2007 (equivalent to $ billion in prices when adjusted for inflation); he dropped off the billionaires&#x27; list in 2020 as a consequence of his Venezuelan assets losing value due to the long economic crisis in Venezuela.

== Early life and education ==
Cisneros was born on 1 June 1945, the son of Diego Cisneros and Albertina Cisneros (née Rendíles Martínez).

Cisneros&#x27;s father, Diego Cisneros, was in business in Caracas from 1929 and received the Pepsi concession for Venezuela in 1940, before going on to gain the concession for private TV channel Venevisión in 1961. The Cisneros family was the wealthiest in South America on the 2006 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranking.

Cisneros graduated from Suffield Academy in Connecticut in 1963. He graduated from Babson College in Massachusetts in 1968.

== &quot;Grupo Cisneros&quot; ==
&quot;Grupo Cisneros&quot; is one of the largest privately held media entertainment organizations in the world. The company has been headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, since 2000.

Cisneros became President of &quot;Grupo Cisneros&quot; when he was 25 years old.

Cisneros&#x27;s wealth came from his holdings in media, entertainment, telecommunications and consumer products companies. &quot;Grupo Cisneros&quot; is one of the largest privately held Spanish-language media and entertainment companies. 

Long an advocate of free enterprise Cisneros for many years expanded his operations outside of Venezuela and into overseas markets, including the U.S., Spain and later China.

In August 2013, Gustavo Cisneros appointed his daughter Adriana Cisneros de Griffin as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cisneros.

Before his death, Cisneros was developing Tropicalia, a multibillion-dollar resort in Miches, northwest of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Its opening is scheduled for 2026.

Cisneros was listed among the world&#x27;s richest men according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, which estimated his fortune at US$1.1 billion in 2019. His wealth decreased from its 2014 secondary peak of US$ 4.4 billion, and its 2007 primary peak of US$ 6.0 billion.

== Politics ==
Although Cisneros and Hugo Chávez were originally friends and Cisneros contributed to Chávez&#x27;s first presidential campaigns, Cisneros was accused of involvement in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt against Chávez after their relationship became strained because of Chávez&#x27;s confrontation with the media.

Cisneros was questioned about his relationship with Chávez.

== Philanthropy ==

Cisneros supported two philanthropic entities: &quot;Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros&quot; and &quot;Fundación Cisneros&quot;.

&quot;Fundación Cisneros&quot; runs a wide range of educational and cultural programs aimed at improving the lives of Latin Americans. These include the AME program for professional development of Latin American educators, visual arts education and awareness based on the &quot;Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros&quot;; PPV, a visual thinking curriculum for Latin American school children, and traveling art exhibits showcasing the talents of Latin American artists for North America and European audiences.

&quot;Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros&quot; is a privately held Latin American art organization based in Venezuela and New York City. Patricia and Gustavo Cisneros began collecting Latin American abstraction after their marriage, in 1970. Over the years, it has grown to more than 2,000 pieces, including about 200 Spanish colonial objects. In addition, the couple have amassed a vast holding of ethnographic material from the Amazon. Based in New York and Caracas, the &quot;Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros&quot; today also includes works by Uruguay&#x27;s Joaquín Torres-García, Brazil&#x27;s Lygia Clark and Venezuelan modern masters Jesús Rafael Soto, Alejandro Otero, and Carlos Cruz-Diez. The Cisneros Foundation was moving toward building a permanent institution in Caracas in the late 1990s until Hugo Chávez was elected president. In 2007, the foundation encountered resistance from the Chávez government when lending works by Venezuelan painter Armando Reverón (1889-1954) to New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art for the museum&#x27;s first retrospective devoted to a single Latin American artist in 50 years.

== Personal life ==
Cisneros was married to his wife, Patricia, from 1970 until his death. She has been a significant MoMA benefactor since 1992, and has been a trustee of the museum and made substantial cash contributions to the museum&#x27;s recent renovation. Her name is on one of the institution&#x27;s exhibition rooms. In addition to MoMA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hammer Museum, Long Beach&#x27;s Museum of Latin American Art, and the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid also have received art loans. 

Cisneros lived in the Dominican Republic beginning in the 1990s.

In addition to Venezuelan citizenship, Cisneros also held United States, Spanish and Dominican citizenship.

Through his father, Diego Cisneros&#x27;s paternal side, Cisneros is related to Pablo de Hita y Salazar, who was the 27th Governor of La Florida from 1674 to 1680. As a tribute to his father, Cisneros published a book about the Cisneros family tree.

=== Death ===
On 29 December 2023, Gustavo Cisneros, died in New York City, at the age of 78. Spanish newspaper El País reported that the cause of his death was pneumonia, a complication following a spinal surgery. The news was confirmed by Cisneros Media, the company owned by Cisneros, through a statement on social media. In the statement, they expressed deep sorrow over his death, describing him as a &quot;visionary leader whose influence extended far beyond the business realm&quot;, known for his strategic vision and commitment to innovation.

<doc id="1131088" wikidata="Q103921" url="?curid=1131088" title="Infanta, Quezon">
<text>Infanta, officially the Municipality of Infanta (, Ilocano: &quot;Ili ti Infanta&quot;), is a municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 76,186 people.

Infanta is the largest lambanog manufacturer in the province of Quezon. The town is also known for its &quot;bayugo&quot; (giant mountain snail) dishes. The town is currently undergoing preparations for establishing a &quot;bayugo&quot; breeding center that would supply &quot;bayugo&quot; to townsfolk. The move is intended to stop the decline of &quot;bayugo&quot; in the wild. Also it is the center of economic activity in the northern part of Quezon. The Infanta town fiesta is celebrated every April 25. Infanta is also known as the &quot;Gateway to the Pacific&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Infanta&quot; may have come from:
*Spanish term &quot;Jesus Infante&quot; (Child Jesus), given by Captain Juan Salvador in 1835.
*Infanta, a title given to the Princess or Heir Apparent of the Spanish Monarchy back in the 13th century. It specifically referred to Isabella Clara Eugenia of Austria, the eldest daughter of King Philip II of Spain, the namesake of the Philippines.

Before the Spanish colonization, this place was known as Binangonan by its first peoples, the Dumagats. &quot;Binangonan&quot; is a Dumagat word pertaining to a sacred place where a &quot;bangon&quot; (&quot;sacred name&quot;) was given by the &quot;Sobkal&quot; (&quot;Bobo a Laki&quot;) to an infant.

==History==
===District of Infanta===

(Translated from: Fray Felix de Huerta&#x27;s “Estado, Topográfico, Estadistíco, Histórico—Religioso, de la Santa y Apostólica Provincia de San Gregorio Magno, de Religiosos Menores Descalzos de la Regular y Mas Estrecha Observancia De Nuestro Padre San Francisco, en las Islas Filipinas”. Binondo: 1865, by Dominador N. Marcaida Jr. (Accessed September 21, 2015 @http://bdh-rd.bne.es).

By decree of the Superior Government granted in the year of 1856, this district was created, with the territory that belonged to the province of the Laguna before; from 14° 30&#x27; up to the 15° 10&#x27; north latitude, including the island of Polillo and other small islands surrounding this. It is bordered on the North by the district of the Principe, on the East by the sea, on the South by the province of Tayabas, and on the West by that of the lake. It is flat land for the most part, has abundant pasture for cattle and horses, great hunting, fishing, wax and multitude of root crops, with an abundance of wood which are good for construction and cabinetry. The capital is located in Binangonan, where the politico-military Governor is located. Its natives were converted by our religious, who founded and managed the following towns:

===Binangonan de Lampon===
In the year 1578, the venerable and zealous Fray Esteban Ortíz planted the consoling sign of the Cross in this town, who toured the east coast of the island in an expanse of more than sixty leagues, while the shortage of missionaries at that time did not allow the continued assistance of a minister until the year of 1609, with the holy martyr Fray Blas Palomino undertaking anew its conversion, formalized this town and was its first minister.

After the years of 1658, the administration of this town was ceded from this apostolic province of St. Gregory to the Augustinian Recollects and they abdicated also in the year 1703, returning it to our charge and numbered then of not more than ninety tributes.

It is located in the 14° 49&#x27; Í0&quot; latitude in a flat land, on the eastern coast of the island and on the right of the river named Agos, which has its origin from the grand cordillera mountains on the Northern part of Luzon island and which river, running from West to East, empties into the sea in front the island of Polillo. It is bordered on the North by the town of Baler, distant about twenty and seven &quot;leguas&quot;: on the East by the island and town of Polillo, an eight-hour time of navigation on fair weather; on the South by the town of Mauban, belonging to the province of Tayabas and as about fifteen &quot;leguas&quot;, and West-Southwest by the town of Siniloan at eight &quot;leguas&quot;, which crosses the mountains above.

It enjoys a temperate and healthy climate in a well-ventilated area.The most common diseases are hot fevers and tuberculosis. It is supplied with waters from the river and several springs, all of good quality. It does not have more roads than the very difficult path through the mount, which leads to the town of Siniloan. To connect with the town of Mauban, it must be done by water, and the navigations are very dangerous, or almost impossible from the months of October up to March, and to connect with the town of Baler, in addition to the aforementioned difficulty in navigation, cannot be taken by land throughout the coast for fear of the many infidels that inhabit the area. The mail is received from the capital of the province when there is opportunity.

The Church, dedicated to Saint Mark the Evangelist, was of bamboo cane and nipa until the year 1732, by which time it was burnt down and the existing one was built, which is made of stone, but roofed with nipa, and the same as the parish house, which serves as a tribunal. There is a school of primary education, endowed by the funds of the community; about six hundred wooden houses and many others from bamboo, distributed in its twenty-eight barrios, some of them quite far from the Church. It is currently served by Fray Lucas Martínez, Preacher of 29 years of age.

===State Of The Parish===
Spanish era writers said of the town:

&quot;This village has no limits. In their lengthy and lush forests are all kinds of woods for construction and cabinetry, of the best quality: many and good pastures for cattle and horses; variety of palms, canes and reeds, with plenty of fruit and rootcrops: abundant hunting buffalo, boar, deer and fowl, with much wax and honey. There is also a quarry of granite stone, discovered the year of 1849 by Fray Antonio del Moral. A little distant from the town exists a safe harbor for ships of high board, but its entry is dangerous to the inexperienced, and from October to March is risky to navigate the coast because of the strong northerly winds that blow. The land reduced to cultivation produces abundant crops of rice, maize, sugarcane, cocoa, coffee and sweet potato. The abaca was planted for the first time in the year 1851 by Fray Antonio del Moral, and gave so happy results that today that its increasing cultivation is continued with large activity and benefit. Its natives are engaged in agriculture, the harvest of the abaca, the nipa wine, whose palm abounds in its land; the breeding of cattle, in the hunting and fishing, whose products, with the excess of other agricultural products, is exported in medium-sized boats to the town of Mauban, in the province of Tayabas and to the towns of Paracale and Mambulao, returning gold dust after being brought to the Capital.&quot;

Below are the Religious Franciscans ministered in Binangonan de Lampon (or Binangonan del Ampon) after Fray Ortíz and Fray Palomino:

Tomás, under the charge of Don Geryasio Memije, 1880 (http://bdh-rd.bne.es) translated by Dominador N. Marcaida Jr.

===Legend===
According to the legend, the people who established the first settlement in the land that became Infanta were led by an elder named Nunong Karugtong. These settlers crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions. After examining multiple sites, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement. This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call &quot;Binangonan de Lampon&quot; which in turn would eventually become the Municipality of Infanta.

=== Spanish Colonial Era ===
In 1578, more than half a century after Ferdinand Magellan and his men landed in Cebu and thirteen years after Miguel López de Legazpi founded the first Spanish settlement also in Cebu, a Spanish priest named Esteban Ortíz arrived in Binangonan de Lampon and planted a wooden cross symbolizing the introduction of Spanish colonial rule at the place. In 1696, Don Diego Mangilaya, a native chieftain developed the settlement into a community and built a wooden chapel at the spot where Nunong Karugtong fell asleep. Since its establishment, the area has been attacked by Moro pirates, and visited by typhoons and cholera epidemics as recent as 2004. In 1803, Captain Pedro de León affiliated Binangonan de Lampon to the province of Nueva Ecija and in 1850, Kapitan Rafael Orozco withdrew Infanta from the province of Nueva Ecija and joined it with the province of Laguna to the west. In 1835, Binangonan de Lampon was renamed &quot;Infanta&quot; by Captain Juan Salvador in honor of the saint &quot;Jesus Infante&quot; (Child Jesus). All the inhabitants of Infanta were given Spanish surnames pursuant to a Royal Decree of November 11, 1848.

=== Philippine Revolution ===
On July 20, 1898, a group of Infanta Katipuneros headed by Colonel Pablo Astilla attacked the Spanish forces holed up at the limestone convent and after several days of siege and fighting, the Spanish soldiers surrendered.

=== American Colonial Era ===
By virtue of the December 10, 1898 Paris Treaty of Peace, American soldiers occupied the town of Infanta and appointed Kapitan Carlos Ruidera Azcárraga as the first &quot;town &quot;presidente&quot;.&quot; He was followed by Rufino Ortíz in 1903 who withdrew Infanta from the province of Laguna and joined it to the province of Tayabas. He also ordered the planting of coconut trees in the barrios (now barangays) of Infanta. During the administration of town &quot;presidente&quot; Gregorio Rutaquio (1911–1916), he constructed the &quot;Gabaldón type&quot; of school house. In 1917-1919, Agustin Pumarada served as the town president, he belonged to the Pumarada Political Clan of Polillo. From 1923 to 1928, Don Florencio Potes became town &quot;&quot;presidente&quot;. He constructed the concrete municipal building and the first telegraph office of the town. From 1935 to 1939, Mr. Fabián Sollesa served as town &quot;presidente&quot;. During his incumbency, the Infanta-Famy Road traversing the Sierra Madre from Infanta to Laguna and Rizal provinces was constructed. Also, piped water from a spring reservoir in barrio (barangay) Gumian was installed.

=== World War II ===
In December 1941 the Japanese Imperial forces occupied the town of Infanta. On May 25, 1945, the liberation by combined Filipino and American soldiers entered in the town was supported by the guerrilla fighters fought the Japanese Imperial forces until the end of World War II.

=== Contemporary history ===
On July 21, 1949, General Nakar was created from the municipality. In 1950, the municipality was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Infanta.

Infanta was partitioned once again as the municipal district of Real became a municipality on June 22, 1963.

<text>Dowry town () was a town that had been devoted by a Bohemian king to his wife – the queen consort.

This was sometimes indicated by the name of the town, as in the case of Hradec Králové (&quot;Castle of the Queen&quot;), Dvůr Králové nad Labem (&quot;Court of the Queen on the Elbe&quot;) or Městec Králové (&quot;Townlet of the Queen&quot;). Other well-known Czech dowry towns are: Mělník, Chrudim, Jaroměř, Nový Bydžov, Polička, Trutnov and Vysoké Mýto.

==History==
All these towns had been bequeathed by Bohemian kings to their wives since the beginning of the 14th century. Most of them are located in eastern Bohemia.

* Hradec Králové, Chrudim and Vysoké Mýto were given to Elizabeth Richeza by Wenceslaus II, later Charles IV donated them to Elizabeth of Pomerania.
* Other towns were donated later, the last one being Nový Bydžov in 1569.
* Since 1603 they were administered separately from other royal towns.
* After Battle of the White Mountain (1621) their importance started to vanish.
* In 1918 all legal forms of dowry towns finally ceased to exist.

Historical centres of the towns are well preserved until today. From time to time cultural or sport events are organised together.

==Royal towns==
Towns owned and directly administered by the king were titled royal towns. 16th century Bohemia had around forty royal and dowry towns. These towns were the eternal property of the monarch and couldn&#x27;t be sold or used as guarantee of a debt although it happened quite often. These towns and their inhabitants had many economic and social privileges. For example, after Hussite Wars such cities formed the Third estate.

<doc id="1131095" wikidata="Q1214072" url="?curid=1131095" title="The Sickness unto Death">
<text>The Sickness unto Death () is a book written by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard in 1849 under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. A work of Christian existentialism, the book is about Kierkegaard&#x27;s concept of despair, which he equates with the Christian concept of sin, which he terms &quot;the sin of despair&quot;. Walter Lowrie wrote that he saw the themes in &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot; as a repetition of those in Kierkegaard’s earlier work, &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, and as being even more closely related to those in &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;. Kierkegaard used two pseudonyms for opposite purposes: &quot;Johannes Climacus&quot; suggests that he is not a Christian, whereas &quot;Anti-Climacus&quot; suggests he is &quot;an extraordinary Christian&quot;.

==Summary==
Anti-Climacus introduces the book with a reference to a phrase in the Gospel of John, 11:4: &quot;This sickness is not unto death.&quot; The phrase occurs in John&#x27;s gospel of Jesus, in which Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. However, Anti-Climacus raises the question: would not this statement still be true even if Jesus had not raised Lazarus from the dead? While the human conception of death is that it is the end of life, the Christian conception of death is that it is merely a stop along the path of eternal life, and thus nothing to be feared. Rather, it is the inability to die that is to be feared. The real &quot;sickness unto death&quot;, according to Anti-Climacus, is not physical death but despair—a kind of spiritual death, which stems from not embracing one&#x27;s self.

According to Kierkegaard, an individual is &quot;in despair&quot; if he does not align himself with God or with God&#x27;s plan for the self. In this way, he loses his self. Kierkegaard defines the self as the &quot;relation&#x27;s relating itself to itself in the relation&quot;, and defines the human experience as the tension between &quot;the finite and the infinite&quot; and between &quot;the possible and the necessary&quot;. He writes that this tension is identifiable with the dialectical balancing act—the relationship—between these opposing features. Although humans are inherently reflective and self-conscious, to become a true &quot;self&quot; one must be conscious that the source and ground of this &quot;self&quot; is love, &quot;the power that created it&quot;. When one either fails to understand the true nature of the self, or the true nature of the power that creates and sustains it, he says, one is in despair.

There are three kinds of despair presented in the book: one of them relates to being unconscious of having a self; another to not wanting to be oneself; and the third, to feeling that one is not oneself. He describes the first kind as &quot;inauthentic despair&quot;, because it is born of ignorance. In this state, one is unaware that one has a self that is separate from its finite reality. One does not realize that there is a power that created and continues to create oneself, and accepts the idea of finitude because one is unaware of the possibility of being more inherent in selfhood. The second kind of despair is refusing to accept the self outside of immediacy; only defining the self in immediate, finite terms. This is the state in which one realizes that one has a self, but wishes to lose this painful awareness by arranging one&#x27;s finite life so as to make the realization unnecessary. This stage is loosely comparable to Sartre&#x27;s bad faith. The third kind is awareness of the self without a willingness to acknowledge the dependence of that self on love, i.e., the power that created one. In this state, one accepts the eternal, and may or may not acknowledge love, but refuses to accept the aspect of the self that is love. Kierkegaard describes this kind of despair as the most heightened kind, and labels it &quot;demonic&quot;.

To not be in despair is to have reconciled the finite with the infinite, to exist in awareness of one&#x27;s own self and of love&#x27;s power. Specifically, Kierkegaard defines the opposite of despair as faith, which he describes by the following: &quot;In relating itself to itself, and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.&quot; People commonly ascribe the name &quot;God&quot; to the &quot;power that created&quot; the self, but Anti-Climacus&#x27;s text is more subtle than this orthodox viewpoint. Kierkegaard certainly was thinking of God, but what it means to have a personal relation with God, and how God is love are the real subjects of this book. While the book is, in many ways, a phenomenology of prayer, it is just as much a phenomenology of what a Romantic-despite-himself could offer to the future of human maturity by way of a relational view of the self as grounded in creative love.

==Relation to other works==
&quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot; has strong existentialist themes. For example, the concepts of the finite and infinite parts of the human self translate to Heidegger&#x27;s concept of &quot;facticity&quot; and Sartre&#x27;s concept of &quot;transcendence&quot; in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. Kierkegaard&#x27;s thesis is, of course, in other ways profoundly different from Sartre, most obviously because of Kierkegaard&#x27;s belief that only religious faith can save the soul from despair. This particular brand of existentialism is often called Christian existentialism.

Some have suggested that the opening of the book is an elaborate parody of the often bafflingly cryptic philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel; however, some scholars, such as Gregor Malantschuk, have suggested otherwise.

==In popular culture==
* The Polish minimalist composer Tomasz Sikorski wrote a piece of music inspired by the work, which includes a recitation of Kierkergaard&#x27;s text.
* The sixteenth episode of the anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;The Sickness Unto Death, and Then...&quot;, is named after the book. Much of the series&#x27; philosophical and psychological subtext is influenced by, and makes reference to, the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer and the existentialism of Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre.
* The manga &quot;Sickness Unto Death&quot; (&quot;Shi ni Itaru Yamai&quot;), by Asada Hikari, uses Kierkegaard&#x27;s ideas of despair within a story about multiple personality disorder.
* In Thomas Bernhard&#x27;s novel &quot;Extinction&quot;, the narrator describes having sudden urges to read &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot;, and he ultimately scoffs at himself for the thought, given his proximity and the present circumstances regarding his mother&#x27;s secret lover, who he simultaneously admires and is sickened by and is present in the same house in the days leading up to her funeral.
* Walker Percy&#x27;s National Book Award-winning novel &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; takes its epigraph from &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot;.
* In Paul Schrader&#x27;s film &quot;First Reformed&quot;, Reverend Toller likens Michael&#x27;s utter despair and sense that life is without meaning to &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Wyoming, also known as the Wyoming Massacre, was a military engagement during the American Revolutionary War between Patriot militia and a force of Loyalist soldiers and Iroquois warriors. The battle took place in the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania on July 3, 1778, in what is now Luzerne County. The result was an overwhelming defeat for the Americans. The battle is often referred to as the &quot;Wyoming Massacre&quot; because of the roughly 300 Patriot casualties, many of whom were killed by the Iroquois as they fled the battlefield or after they had been taken prisoner.

Widespread looting and burning of buildings occurred throughout the Wyoming Valley subsequent to the battle, but non-combatants were not harmed. Most of the inhabitants fled across the Pocono Mountains to Stroudsburg and Easton or down the Susquehanna River to Sunbury.

Within weeks, a widely distributed but highly inaccurate newspaper report claimed that hundreds of women and children had been massacred. This false version of events was accepted as proven fact by many writers for decades afterwards but has been thoroughly discredited.

==Background==

In 1777, British general John Burgoyne tried to gain control of the Hudson River valley during the American Revolutionary War, but was forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga in October. News of the surrender prompted France to enter the war as an American ally. British military officials were concerned that the French might attempt to retake parts of Canada which they had lost in the French and Indian War, so they adopted a more defensive strategy in Quebec. 

The British recruited Loyalists and Indigenous allies to conduct a frontier war along the northern and western borders of the Thirteen Colonies. British Indian Department officer John Butler was granted permission to enlist Loyalists in a regiment that came be to known as Butler&#x27;s Rangers. Seneca chiefs Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter encouraged Seneca and Cayuga warriors to participate in raids against frontier settlements. Similarly, Mohawk war leader Joseph Brant encouraged Mohawk participation and recruited Loyalist volunteers to fight with him. By April 1778, the Seneca were raiding settlements along the Allegheny River and the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. In late May, Joseph Brant raided Cobleskill in Tryon County, New York.

In early June, Butler, Sayenqueraghta, and Brant met at Tioga Point at the confluence of the Chemung River and the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. Although Butler and the Iroquois were planning a major attack on the Wyoming Valley, it was agreed that Brant would return to Onaquaga and prepare to raid settlements in New York.

==Battle==
Major Butler with 110 Butler&#x27;s Rangers and 464 Indigenous warriors departed Tioga Point on June 27, and arrived at the head of the Wyoming Valley three days later. Most of the Indigenous warriors were Seneca and Cayuga led by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter, and Fish Carrier, but contingents of Lenape (Delaware), Onondaga, and Tuscarora were also present. The Americans were alerted to their approach when 12 settlers working in a field and nearby tannery were attacked. 

The inhabitants fled to the forts scattered throughout the Wyoming Valley including Fort Wyoming (Wilkes-Barre) and Fort Pittston. Meanwhile, the Patriot militia assembled at Forty Fort under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Butler, an officer of the Continental Army home on leave.

On July 1, Fort Wintermoot at the north end of the valley surrendered without a shot being fired. That evening Fort Jenkins also surrendered after a brief skirmish. The terms of the surrender for both forts promised that the inhabitants would not be harmed.

Demands for Forty Fort to surrender were rebuked. Lieutenant Colonel Butler and his senior officers, Colonel Nathan Denison and Lieutenant Colonel George Dorrance, advocated remaining in the fort, however, their subordinates, led by Lazarus Stewart, were overwhelmingly in favor of marching out to meet the enemy. Butler gave in and by mid-afternoon on July 3, a force of roughly 375 men, organized into five companies of militia and one company of Continentals, sallied from the fort.

Every movement by the Americans was observed by Indigenous scouts. Major Butler ordered Fort Wintermoot burned in order to trick the Americans into thinking that he was withdrawing. Butler positioned his forces in a &quot;fine open wood&quot; with the Rangers on the left and his Indigenous allies on the right. He ordered his men to lie on the ground and wait for the order to fire. 

The Americans deployed into a line of battle as they approached Fort Wintermoot. After firing three unanswered volleys they had advanced to within 100 yards of Major Butler&#x27;s position, unaware that they were being flanked by the Seneca and Cayuga. Following a devastating volley from the Rangers and their Indigenous allies, the Seneca and Cayuga broke cover and attacked the Americans with maul, tomahawk and spear.

The battle lasted about 30 minutes. An attempt to reform the American line quickly turned into a frantic rout, as the inexperienced militiamen panicked and ran. It became a deadly race from which only about 60 escaped including Lieutenant Colonel Butler and Colonel Denison. Many of those overtaken by the Seneca and Cayuga were killed and scalped immediately, however, some were taken captive and were later tortured and executed.

In his report to the commanding officer of Fort Niagara, Major Butler stated that his Indigenous allies had taken 227 scalps and five prisoners, while Colonel Denison informed him that 302 had been killed.

==Aftermath==

Lieutenant Colonel Butler and the surviving Continental soldiers left the Wyoming Valley on the morning of July 4 rather than being taken as prisoners of war. That afternoon, Colonel Denison surrendered Forty Fort along with what remained of the militia. Major Butler paroled them on their promise to take no part in further hostilities, and gave his assurance that &quot;the lives of the inhabitants [would be] preserved entire and unharmed.&quot;

None of the valley&#x27;s inhabitants were killed after the capitulation, but many did have their personal effects plundered by Butler&#x27;s Indigenous allies. In the days that followed, houses and barns throughout the Wyoming Valley were looted and burned. Mills were destroyed and livestock was driven off. The inhabitants of the valley fled, either east through the Great Swamp and the Pocono Mountains to Fort Penn (Stroudsburg) or Easton, or by rafting down the Susquehanna to Fort Augusta (Sunbury).

In his report, Major Butler wrote: 
But what gives me the sincerest satisfaction is that I can, with great truth, assure you that in the destruction of the settlement not a single person was hurt except such as were in arms, to these, in truth, the Indians gave no quarter.

J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, who was in the Wyoming Valley a few weeks after the battle, wrote: &quot;Happily these fierce people, satisfied with the death of those who had opposed them in arms, treated the defenceless ones, the woman and children, with a degree of humanity almost hitherto unparalleled&quot;.

At the time of the battle a company of militia led by Captain Jeremiah Blanchard and Lieutenant Timothy Keyes held Pittston Fort, on the east side of the Susquehanna River several miles upstream from Forty Fort. The fort was surrendered on July 4, 1778, one day after the battle, and was partially burned a few days later. Pittston Fort was reoccupied, restored and strengthened in 1780. It remained in use until after the end of the war.

According to one source, Lieutenant Colonel George Dorrance was captured in the battle. Since he was an officer of prominence, dressed in a new uniform, with new sword and equipment, he had been spared death under the belief that more could be obtained for his ransom than could be made from his slaughter. On the morning of the 4th, his captors were escorting Dorrance to Forty Fort when he became exhausted and was unable to proceed farther. His captors killed him, one taking his scalp and sword, the other his coat and tricorne. They later went through the fort showing off this clothing and took particular pains to exhibit themselves to Mrs. Dorrance, &quot;who sat grieving over the fate of her husband.&quot;

Major Butler reported &quot;one Indian killed, two Rangers and eight Indians wounded.&quot; He claimed that his force had burned 1,000 houses, and drove off 1,000 cattle as well as many sheep and hogs. Richard Cartwright, Major Butler&#x27;s civilian secretary, recorded in his journal: &quot;seven wounded, two of who died of their wounds.&quot;

Butler and his forces departed the valley on July 8, and returned to Tioga Point. Later that month Butler returned to Fort Niagara while the Rangers, under the command of Captain William Caldwell proceeded to Onaquaga.

In the aftermath of the battle, the settlers who had fled the Wyoming Valley spread harrowing stories and rumors about the American defeat that contributed to a general panic across the frontiers of New York and Pennsylvania. Some American newspapers picked up on these stories and went even further, producing unsubstantiated accounts about the burning of women, children, and wounded soldiers inside Forty Fort on the day after the battle. The American public was outraged by such reports of a massacre and other atrocities. Many saw it as just one more reason to support American independence.

In early August 1778, Lieutenant Colonel Butler returned to the Wyoming Valley with the Westmoreland Independent Company and a company of militia. In late August they were joined by a detachment from Hartley&#x27;s Additional Continental Regiment. Some of the settlers who had fled in early July also began to return.

In September the Westmoreland Independent Company and Hartley&#x27;s Additional Continental Regiment participated in a counter-raid commanded by Colonel Thomas Hartley that destroyed a number of abandoned Delaware villages in the vicinity of Tioga Point. Afterwards the Independent Company and a company of Hartley&#x27;s Regiment garrisoned the rebuilt Fort Wyoming (Wilkes-Barre).

In October 1778, a burial party recovered the scattered remains of the fallen. According to one source, 60 Patriot bodies were found on the battlefield and another 36 along the line of retreat. Years later they were exhumed and reburied in a common grave when the Wyoming Monument was built.

The Seneca were angered by the accusations of atrocities following the Battle of Wyoming. Coupled with anger at militiamen who ignored their paroles, such accusations led the Seneca to attack civilians at Cherry Valley in November 1778. The Battle of Wyoming and the Cherry Valley Massacre encouraged American military leaders to strike back against the Iroquois. In the late summer of 1779, the Sullivan Expedition, commissioned by General George Washington, methodically destroyed 40 Iroquois villages and an enormous quantity of stored corn and vegetables throughout the Finger Lakes region. The Iroquois struggled to recover from the damage inflicted by Sullivan&#x27;s soldiers, and many died of starvation that winter, however, they continued to raid frontier settlements until the end of the war.

==Legacy==

The Battle of Wyoming remained well-known to most Americans for the rest of the eighteenth century and for most of the nineteenth. It particularly reemerged in national discourse during the War of 1812 when Americans again found themselves fighting the British and their Indigenous allies on the frontier. Some newspaper accounts readily compared the Battle of Frenchtown (also known as the River Raisin Massacre) in 1813 to the Wyoming Massacre.

The &quot;Wyoming Massacre&quot; was described by the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell in his 1809 poem &quot;Gertrude of Wyoming&quot;. Campbell depicted Mohawk war leader Joseph Brant as a &quot;monster&quot; in the poem, even though Brant was at Onaquaga on the day of the attack.

The western state of Wyoming is named after the Wyoming Valley. The state received its name from the United States Congress when the Wyoming Territory was created in 1868.

Construction of a monument to commemorate the battle began in 1833 but took a decade to complete due to a lack of funds. The 19 meter (63 ft) tall obelisk is the site of a common grave containing the remains of many of the victims of the battle. The names of 176 of the slain are inscribed on the monument.

The Battle of Wyoming is commemorated each year by the Wyoming Commemorative Association, a local non-profit organization, which holds an annual ceremony on the grounds of the Wyoming Monument. The commemorative ceremonies began in 1878 to mark the 100th anniversary of the battle and massacre. The principal speaker at the event was President Rutherford B. Hayes. During the 100th anniversary commemoration, the people of Wyoming Valley used the motto &quot;An honest tale speeds best when plainly told&quot; in an effort to promote the historical account of the battle. The annual program has continued each year since then.

<text>Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972) is an American film director and actress.

==Early life==
Eastwood was born on May 22, 1972, in Santa Monica, California, to Margaret Neville Johnson and Clint Eastwood. She has a brother, Kyle, and six known paternal half-siblings: Laurie, Kimber, Scott, Kathryn, Francesca, and Morgan.

Eastwood landed some professional acting roles during her childhood and preadolescent years, making an uncredited movie debut at the age of seven in &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; (1980). Her acting in the 1984 thriller &quot;Tightrope&quot; earned her a Young Artist Award nomination. She has also worked as a runway and magazine model in Paris, posing for several European fashion magazines and &quot;Vogue&quot; (U.S. edition). She posed nude in the February 2003 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

<text>Wayne Anthony Allwine (February 7, 1947 – May 18, 2009) was an American voice actor, sound effects editor and foley artist. He was best remembered as the third official voice of Mickey Mouse in English (following Walt Disney and Jimmy MacDonald) and the first official casting following the establishment of Disney Character Voices International in 1988. To date, he holds the record for the longest-running voice actor to play Mickey Mouse, having performed the role for 32 years. He was notably married to Russi Taylor, who voiced Minnie Mouse.

==Early life==
Wayne Anthony Allwine was born in Glendale, California, on February 7, 1947. He is a graduate of John Burroughs High School, where he was particularly active in the school&#x27;s musical theater department. His father was a barbershop quartet singer.

While in high school, he formed his own acoustic music group, The International Singers, which performed in clubs and colleges throughout the state. After graduating, he briefly toured with the instrumental rock band Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows. In addition to playing rhythm guitar, he can also be heard on harmonica and sax mouthpiece on the 1968 track &quot;Cycle-Delic&quot;. He later became an accomplished Dixieland jazz drummer, occasionally sitting in with Firehouse Five Plus Two alumni George Probert&#x27;s &quot;Monrovia Old Style Jazz Band&quot;.

==Career==

In 1966, Allwine started work in the mailing room at the Disney studios, before working in the sound effects department with Jimmy MacDonald.

After working in the sound effects department for seven years, Allwine got a call from Disney for an open audition for the role of Mickey Mouse in late 1976, after a previous actor failed to show up. Upon auditioning for the role, Allwine became the third official voice of Mickey Mouse in 1977. He replaced Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had taken over from Walt Disney himself, who had performed the role since 1928 as well as supplying Mickey&#x27;s voice for animated portions of the original &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television show (ABC-TV, 1955–1959).

Allwine&#x27;s first appearance as Mickey was voicing the animated lead-ins for &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in 1977. His first appearance as Mickey for a theatrical release was in the 1983 featurette &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. In the same film, he voiced a Santa Claus on the street appealing for charity donations at the start of the movie, Moley (who appears with Ratty) &quot;collecting for the poor&quot;, and one of the two weasel undertakers in the Christmas future scene.

He also starred in films such as &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; (2004), and the TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006–2012). He has provided Mickey&#x27;s voice in the popular &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series of video games prior to &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot;, which was done in collaboration with Japanese video game company Square Enix. &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, which was the last game that used his voice (mainly with Mickey as a playable character in Mission Mode), would leave a message in his memory as the game was released in North America several months after his death. 

In addition to his voice work, Allwine spent much of his career as a sound effects editor and foley artist for Disney films and TV shows, including &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987); as well as &quot;Innerspace&quot; (1987), &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1988), and &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; for other studios. In 1986, he was awarded a group Primetime Emmy Award for his sound editing contributions to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s anthology television series &quot;Amazing Stories.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1991, he married Russi Taylor, who voiced Minnie Mouse from 1986 to 2019, and they were named Disney Legends in 2008. They remained married up until his death in 2009. Allwine fathered three biological children and one adopted child from previous marriages.

==Death==
Allwine died of hypertensive crisis caused by complications from acute diabetes at the age of 62 on May 18, 2009, at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. His prospective understudy, Bret Iwan, assumed the role of voicing Mickey Mouse. Allwine is now interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>In geometry, the gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the Johnson solids (). It is also a canonical polyhedron.

== Construction ==
The gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron can be constructed similarly as rhombicosidodecahedron: it is constructed from parabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron by attaching two regular pentagonal cupolas onto its decagonal faces. As a result, these pentagonal cupolas cover its dodecagonal faces, so the resulting polyhedron has 20 equilateral triangles, 30 squares, and 10 regular pentagons as its faces. The difference between those two polyhedrons is that one of two pentagonal cupolas from the gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is rotated through 36°. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular polygons is called the Johnson solid, and the gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is among them, enumerated as the 72th Johnson solid formula_1.
== Properties ==
Because the two aforementioned polyhedrons have similar construction, they have the same surface area and volume. A gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron with edge length has a surface area by adding all of the area of its faces:
formula_2
Its volume can be calculated by slicing it into two regular pentagonal cupolas and one parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, and adding their volumes:
formula_3

The gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron is one of the five Johnson solids that do not have Rupert property, meaning a polyhedron of the same or larger size and the same shape as it cannot pass through a hole in it. The other Johnson solids with no such property are parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, and paragyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron.

== See also ==
Alternative Johnson solids, constructed by rotating different cupolae of a rhombicosidodecahedron, are: 
* The parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_4 where two opposing cupolae are rotated;
* The metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_5 where two non-opposing cupolae are rotated; 
* And the trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron formula_6 where three cupolae are rotated.

<doc id="1131112" wikidata="Q497188" url="?curid=1131112" title="Kaikōura Ranges">
<text>The Kaikōura Ranges are two parallel ranges of mountains located in the Canterbury Region in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand. The two ranges are visible from a great distance, including from the southern coast of the North Island.

== Description ==
Formed along New Zealand&#x27;s Marlborough Fault System, they can be seen as the northernmost extension of the Southern Alps in the South Island. Named the &quot;Looker-on mountains,&quot; by Captain James Cook, they take their name from the town of Kaikōura at the southern extreme of the more eastern range, the Seaward Kaikōuras. This range rises straight from (and dominates) the coast to the north of the town, and reaches its highest point with the Mount Manakau.

The long straight river valley of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River separate the Seaward Kaikōuras from the longer and loftier Inland Kaikōuras. This latter range contains the highest peak in the ranges, the Tapuae-o-Uenuku, the translation from the Māori of which is the poetic &quot;Footprint of the rainbow.&quot; Beyond the Inland Kaikōuras is the valley of the Awatere River, which runs parallel to that of the Waiau Toa / Clarence. The climate is characterised by a dry cold winter.

==Demographics==
The statistical area of Kaikōura Ranges includes Clarence and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Kaikōura Ranges had a population of 1,689 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 144 people (9.3%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 270 people (19.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 585 households, comprising 894 males and 795 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.12 males per female. The median age was 44.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 315 people (18.7%) aged under 15 years, 246 (14.6%) aged 15 to 29, 870 (51.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 261 (15.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.5% European/Pākehā, 17.1% Māori, 0.7% Pasifika, 3.0% Asian, and 2.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 51.3% had no religion, 36.6% were Christian, 0.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.9% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 186 (13.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 291 (21.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $35,600, compared with $31,800 nationally. 213 people (15.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 834 (60.7%) people were employed full-time, 246 (17.9%) were part-time, and 15 (1.1%) were unemployed.

== Flora ==
These mountains are characterised by tussock land, fellfields, and large areas of open scree, while lowland forests have largely been cleared. The Spencer range to the south meanwhile has a more intact beech forest covering.

== Fauna ==
The ranges contain the Kowhai Valley and Shearwater Stream Important Bird Area, some 15 km (9.3 mi) inland from the coastal town of Kaikōura.

<text>Land management is the process of managing the use and development of land resources. Those resources are used for a variety of purposes for example agriculture, forestry, water resource management, human settlements and tourism. One aim of land management is to prevent or reverse land degradation. Another aim is to ensure water security by increasing soil moisture availability, decreasing surface runoff, and decreasing soil erosion. Unsustainable land managements leads to land being over- or misused which in turn degrades the land, reduces productivity and disrupts natural equilibriums.

Sustainable land management (SLM) is the set of practices and technologies that aim to integrate the management of land, water, and other environmental resources to meet human needs while ensuring long-term sustainability, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and livelihoods. Sustainable forest management is a sub-category of sustainable land management.
== Definition ==

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report describes &quot;land management&quot; as &quot;The sum of land-use practices (e.g., sowing, fertilising, weeding, harvesting, thinning and clear-cutting) that take place within broader land-use categories.&quot; Land use itself is &quot;The total of arrangements, activities and inputs applied to a parcel of land.&quot; Land use categories include: forest land, cropland (agricultural land), grassland, wetlands, settlements and &quot;other lands&quot;.

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) applies the term &quot;land management&quot; in a wide context. Besides agriculture and forestry, they include the mineral extraction sector, property and estate management: &quot;Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside.

=== Sustainable land management ===
Sustainable land management (SLM) is a process in a charged environment between environmental protection and the guarantee claim of ecosystem services on the one hand. On the other hand, it is about productivity of agriculture and forestry with respect to demographic growth and increasing pressure in land use.

SLM has been defined in various reports as follows:

* By IPCC in 2022: &quot;The stewardship and use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions&quot;. This wording is very similar to the longer wording used by the United Nations (UN) 1992 Rio Earth Summit in 1992: &quot;The use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions.&quot;
* By World Bank in 2006: &quot;SLM is defined as a knowledge-based procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods.

== Purposes ==
One aim of sustainable land management is to prevent or reverse land degradation. Another aim is to ensure water security by increasing soil moisture availability, decreasing surface runoff, and decreasing soil erosion.

The IPCC stated that sustainable land management can play a role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. This takes place at various scales, at scales, namely &quot;from individual farms to entire watersheds&quot;. 

A World Bank report in 2006 explained: &quot;SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing population. Improper land management can lead to land degradation and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, hydrology, carbon sequestration) functions of watersheds and landscapes.&quot;

== In climate change context ==
The IPCC&#x27;s Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) explains the linkages between sustainable land management and climate change mitigation. The full title of the report is the &quot;Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems&quot;.

The report&#x27;s &quot;summary for policy makers&quot; explains that, &quot;Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are profitable within three to 10 years (medium confidence). While they can require upfront investment, actions to ensure sustainable land management can improve crop yields and the economic value of pasture. Land restoration and rehabilitation measures improve livelihood systems and provide both short-term positive economic returns and longer-term benefits in terms of climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity and enhanced ecosystem functions and services.&quot;

== Methods ==
Land management options exist to focus on healthy soils and to &quot;reduce vulnerability to soil erosion and nutrient loss&quot;. Examples include &quot;growing green manure crops and cover crops, crop residue retention, reduced/zero tillage, and maintenance of ground cover through improved grazing management&quot;. There are also land management options for farmers that build soil carbon and therefore provide important climate change mitigation benefits through carbon sequestration: &quot;agroforestry, perennial pasture phases and use of perennial grains&quot;. All these methods reduce soil erosion and nutrient leaching.

Land management options that &quot;do not require land use change and do not create demand for more land conversion&quot; include:

* improved management of cropland and grazing lands, 
* sustainable forest management, and 
* increased soil organic carbon content. 

For example in Ethiopia, &quot;over 85% of the land is estimated to be moderately to severely degraded&quot;. The current practices of sustainable land management (SLM) involve a variety of structural and nonstructural elements integrated at the catchment scale, providing different roles in managing water resources. The structural measures (soil bunds, contour trenches, etc.) significantly improve infiltration and water storage potential of the agricultural landscapes. On the other hand, the nonstructural measures, such as the elimination of open grazing on communal grazing land and the abandonment of postharvest grazing on cultivated land, help improve the water retention capacity of the soils and reduce nonproductive evaporative water losses. In addition, the current practices of SLM attempts to sustain diverse land use mosaics at the catchment scale, including protected areas (gullied lands and communal grazing lands), cultivated land and home gardens, with the aim of harnessing potential uses, services, and values from a catchment.

<text>In cryptography, REDOC II and REDOC III are block ciphers designed by cryptographer Michael Wood for Cryptech Inc and are optimised for use in software. Both REDOC ciphers are patented.

REDOC II (Cusick and Wood, 1990) operates on 80-bit blocks with a 160-bit key. The cipher has 10 rounds, and uses key-dependent S-boxes and &quot;masks&quot; used to select the tables for use in different rounds of the cipher. Cusick found an attack on one round, and Biham and Shamir (1991) used differential cryptanalysis to attack one round with 2300 encryptions. Biham and Shamir also found a way of recovering three masks for up to four rounds faster than exhaustive search. A prize of US$5,000 was offered for the best attack on one round of REDOC-II, and $20,000 for the best practical known-plaintext attack.

REDOC III is a more efficient cipher. It operates on an 80-bit block and accepts a variable-length key of up to 20,480 bits. The algorithm consists only of XORing key bytes with message bytes, and uses no permutations or substitutions. Ken Shirriff describes a differential attack on REDOC-III requiring 220 chosen plaintexts and 230 memory.

<text>Gildo Massó González (December 8, 1926 – January 15, 2007) was the founder and CEO of Masso Enterprises and the developer of the concept of &quot;build it yourself&quot; low-cost houses.

==Early years==
Massó was born and raised in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education. His parents were Rafael Massó Vázquez and Francisca González Padín. He was a hardworking young man who admired the Puerto Rican political leader Luis Muñoz Marín. He helped support his family by working in the local hardware store. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico.

==First Masso Hardware Store==
In 1951, Massó opened his first hardware store, Ferretería Masso (Masso Hardware Store) in San Lorenzo, which became a successful venture. He married Carmen Tuly Aponte in 1953. In 1954 he established his first cinder block factory.

In 1959, Massó ventured into the construction business and built the Massó Subdivision in San Lorenzo. In 1961, he opened Caguas&#x27; Lumber Yard in Caguas. In 1967, the Massó Cement Factory moved to much larger facility in Gurabo.

==Casas Massó==
In 1974, with the need for affordable housing in Puerto Rico, Massó developed a concept of selling low-cost houses, made out of wood, known as Modelos Massó or Casas Massó (Masso Models). The idea was to supply customers with the necessary elements to build a low-cost home. The all-inclusive packages included floor plans, building materials, and construction loans.

In 1981, Massó acquired two Carlos Armstrong Hardware Stores in Ponce, and in 1983, he opened the Cayey Home Center in Cayey. In 1984 Massó built 550 residences in San Lorenzo, which is now known as &quot;Massó City&quot; and, in 1986, he built 67 residences in the Cerro Gordo sector of San Lorenzo.

In 1992, Massó introduced the new Casas Massó which was made of cement, with the same concept as the first models. In 1993, he set up a Super Massó Hardware Store consisting of 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) and offering over 60,000 products in Caguas. In 1996 Massó Enterprises was involved in a project which built 169 residences in Paseo San Lorenzo. In 1997 Massó acquired six Builder&#x27;s Square Stores in Caguas, Bayamon, Carolina, Ponce, and Mayaguez. These were renamed Plaza Massó.

In 1995, the Massó Hardware Store introduced Auto-Express in which the customer used a drive-through to make purchases. This concept increased sales by 15%.

Gildo Massó introduced new models of the Casas Massó in 2001 and 2003.

Massó Enterprises has over $65 million in annual sales. 
The company also has the training center&quot;Massó School for all employees.

==Later years==
Gildo Massó was named Business Man of the Year in 2004 and the VIP of the Week by Chrysler Corp.

A devoted Catholic and to the fulfillment of his religious obligations, Gildo was a supporter and advocate of Cursillos de Cristiandad Movement for more than 40 years, both in the Archdiocese of San Juan and the Diocese of Caguas. He designed and generously directed the construction of both Casas de Cursillos in each diocesan community.

On January 15, 2007, Gildo Massó died from health complications during a routine medical checkup in the Auxilio Mutuo Hospital of Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. He is survived by his wife Carmen Tuly Aponte and his two children Gildo and Tuly Massó.

<text>The median eminence is generally defined as the portion of the ventral hypothalamus from which the portal vessels arise. The median eminence is a small swelling on the tuber cinereum, posterior to and on top of the pituitary stalk; it lies in the area roughly bounded on its posterolateral region by the cerebral peduncles, and on its anterolateral region by the optic chiasm.

As one of the seven areas of the brain devoid of a blood–brain barrier, the median eminence is a circumventricular organ having permeable capillaries. Its main function is as a gateway for release of hypothalamic hormones, although it does share contiguous perivascular spaces with the adjacent hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, indicating a potential sensory role.
==Physiology==
The median eminence is a part of the hypothalamus from which regulatory hormones are released. It is integral to the hypophyseal portal system, which connects the hypothalamus with the pituitary gland. The pars nervosa (part of the posterior pituitary gland) is continuous with the median eminence via the infundibular stalk. Parvocellular neurosecretory cells from the hypothalamus terminate in the median eminence.

The median eminence is the structure where secretions of the hypothalamus (releasing and inhibiting hormones) regulatory hormones, known as &quot;hypophysiotropic hormones&quot;) collect before entering the portal system emptying into the general circulation. Such hypophysiotropic hormones include: CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor), GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), GHRH (growth hormone-releasing hormone), and DA (dopamine). These hypophysiotropic hormones stimulate or inhibit the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary. Further, anatomical evidence exists for bidirectional communication between the median eminence and the arcuate and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.

<doc id="1131136" wikidata="Q11298044" url="?curid=1131136" title="List of Java keywords">
<text>In the Java programming language, a keyword is any one of 68 reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language. Because of this, programmers cannot use keywords in some contexts, such as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifier. Of these 68 keywords, 17 of them are only contextually reserved, and can sometimes be used as an identifier, unlike standard reserved words. Due to their special functions in the language, most integrated development environments for Java use syntax highlighting to display keywords in a different colour for easy identification.

==List of Java keywords==
;codice_1
:Added in Java 9, the underscore has become a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name anymore.

;codice_2
: A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Abstract methods must be implemented in the sub classes. The abstract keyword cannot be used with variables or constructors. Note that an abstract class isn&#x27;t required to have an abstract method at all.

;codice_3 (added in J2SE 1.4)
:Assert describes a predicate (a true–false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. Assertions are disabled at runtime by default, but can be enabled through a command-line option or programmatically through a method on the class loader.
;codice_4
:Defines a boolean variable for the values &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; only. By default, the value of boolean primitive type is false. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_4.

;codice_6
:Used to end the execution in the current loop body. 
:Used to break out of a codice_7 block.

;codice_8
:The codice_9 keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two&#x27;s complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_9.

;codice_11
:A statement in the codice_7 block can be labeled with one or more codice_13 or codice_14 labels. The codice_7 statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching codice_13 label; see codice_7.

;codice_18
:Used in conjunction with a codice_19 block and an optional codice_20 block. The statements in the codice_21 block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the codice_19 block.

;codice_23
:Defines a character variable capable of holding any character of the java source file&#x27;s character set.

;codice_24
:A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is implicitly . The class keyword can also be used in the form Class.class to get a Class object without needing an instance of that class. For example, String.class can be used instead of doing new String().getClass().

;codice_25
:Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, codice_26 resumes execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

;codice_27
:The codice_27 keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed if no codice_29 matches the specified value; see &quot;codice_7&quot;. Alternatively, the codice_27 keyword can also be used to declare default values in a Java annotation. From Java 8 onwards, the codice_27 keyword can be used to allow an interface to provide an implementation of a method.

;codice_33
:The codice_34 keyword is used in conjunction with codice_35 to create a do-while loop, which executes a block of statements associated with the loop and then tests a boolean expression associated with the codice_36. If the expression evaluates to codice_37, the block is executed again; this continues until the expression evaluates to codice_38.

;codice_39
:The codice_40 keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit double precision IEEE 754 floating-point number. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_40.

;codice_42
:The codice_43 keyword is used in conjunction with codice_44 to create an if-else statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to codice_37, the block of statements associated with the codice_46 are evaluated; if it evaluates to codice_38, the block of statements associated with the codice_43 are evaluated.

;codice_49 (added in J2SE 5.0)
:A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class .

;codice_50
:Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass; used in an interface declaration to specify one or more superinterfaces. Class X extends class Y to add functionality, either by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by overriding methods of class Y. An interface Z extends one or more interfaces by adding methods. Class X is said to be a subclass of class Y; Interface Z is said to be a subinterface of the interfaces it extends.
:Also used to specify an upper bound on a type parameter in Generics.

;codice_51
:Define an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. More specifically: a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command. All methods in a final class are implicitly codice_52.

;codice_53
:Used to define a block of statements for a block defined previously by the codice_19 keyword. The codice_20 block is executed after execution exits the codice_19 block and any associated codice_21 clauses regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught, or execution left method in the middle of the codice_19 or codice_21 blocks using the codice_60 keyword.

;codice_61
:The codice_62 keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit single precision IEEE 754 floating-point number. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_62.

;codice_64
:The codice_65 keyword is used to create a for loop, which specifies a variable initialization, a boolean expression, and an incrementation. The variable initialization is performed first, and then the boolean expression is evaluated. If the expression evaluates to codice_37, the block of statements associated with the loop are executed, and then the incrementation is performed. The boolean expression is then evaluated again; this continues until the expression evaluates to codice_38.

:As of J2SE 5.0, the codice_65 keyword can also be used to create a so-called &quot;enhanced for loop&quot;, which specifies an array or object; each iteration of the loop executes the associated block of statements using a different element in the array or codice_69.

;codice_70
:The codice_46 keyword is used to create an if statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to codice_37, the block of statements associated with the if statement is executed. This keyword can also be used to create an if-else statement; see &quot;codice_73&quot;.

;codice_74
:Included in a class declaration to specify one or more interfaces that are implemented by the current class. A class inherits the types and abstract methods declared by the interfaces.

;codice_75
:Used at the beginning of a source file to specify classes or entire Java packages to be referred to later without including their package names in the reference. Since J2SE 5.0, codice_75 statements can import codice_77 members of a class.

;codice_78
:A binary operator that takes an object reference as its first operand and a class or interface as its second operand and produces a boolean result. The codice_78 operator evaluates to true if and only if the runtime type of the object is assignment compatible with the class or interface.

;codice_80
:The codice_81 keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed two&#x27;s complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_81.

;codice_83
:Used to declare an interface that only contains abstract or default methods, constant (codice_84) fields and codice_77 interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the codice_74 keyword. As multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, interfaces are used to circumvent it. An interface can be defined within another interface.

;codice_87
:The codice_88 keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit signed two&#x27;s complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_88.

;codice_90
:Used in method declarations to specify that the method is not implemented in the same Java source file, but rather in another language.

;codice_91
:Used to create an instance of a class or array object. Using keyword for this end is not completely necessary (as exemplified by Scala), though it serves two purposes: it enables the existence of different namespace for methods and class names, it defines statically and locally that a fresh object is indeed created, and of what runtime type it is (arguably introducing dependency into the code).

;codice_92
:Java package is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the codice_93 keyword.

;codice_94
:The codice_95 keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; private members can only be accessed by other members of their own class.

;codice_94
:The codice_97 keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; protected members can only be accessed by members of their own class, that class&#x27;s subclasses or classes from the same package.

;codice_94
:The codice_99 keyword is used in the declaration of a class, method, or field; public classes, methods, and fields can be accessed by the members of any class.

;codice_100
:Used to finish the execution of a method. It can be followed by a value required by the method definition that is returned to the caller.

;codice_101
:The codice_102 keyword is used to declare a field that can hold a 16-bit signed two&#x27;s complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type codice_102.

;codice_104
:Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. codice_77 also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of to a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. Classes and interfaces declared as codice_77 members of another class or interface are behaviorally top-level classes.

;codice_107
:Inheritance basically used to achieve dynamic binding or run-time polymorphism in java. Used to access members of a class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of its superclass. The codice_108 keyword is also used to forward a call from a constructor to a constructor in the superclass.
:Also used to specify a lower bound on a type parameter in Generics.

;codice_109
:The codice_110 keyword is used in conjunction with codice_13 and codice_14 to create a switch statement, which evaluates a variable, matches its value to a specific codice_29 (including patterns), and executes the block of statements associated with that codice_29. If no codice_29 matches the value, the optional block labelled by codice_27 is executed, if included. The switch keyword can also be used with the non-reserved keyword codice_117 to create switch expressions.

;codice_118
:Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the current thread executes the code. For static methods, the object locked is the class&#x27;s codice_119. Guarantees that at most one thread at a time operating on the same object executes that code. The mutex lock is automatically released when execution exits the synchronized code. Fields, classes and interfaces cannot be declared as &quot;synchronized&quot;.

;codice_120
:Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. codice_121 can be used to access class members and as a reference to the current instance. The codice_121 keyword is also used to forward a call from one constructor in a class to another constructor in the same class.

;codice_123
:Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the codice_21 keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread&#x27;s uncaught exception handler.

;codice_125
:Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of codice_126 must be declared using the codice_127 keyword.

;codice_128
:Declares that an instance field is not part of the default serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized, only the values of its non-transient instance fields are included in the default serial representation. When an object is deserialized, transient fields are initialized only to their default value. If the default form is not used, e.g. when a &quot;serialPersistentFields&quot; table is declared in the class hierarchy, all codice_129 keywords are ignored.

;codice_130
:Defines a block of statements that have exception handling. If an exception is thrown inside the codice_19 block, an optional codice_21 block can handle declared exception types. Also, an optional codice_20 block can be declared that will be executed when execution exits the codice_19 block and codice_21 clauses, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. A codice_19 block must have at least one codice_21 clause or a codice_20 block.

;codice_139
:The codice_140 keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value.

;codice_141
:Used in field declarations to guarantee visibility of changes to variables across threads. Every read of a volatile variable will be read from main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache. Methods, classes and interfaces thus cannot be declared &quot;volatile&quot;, nor can local variables or parameters.

;codice_142
:The codice_36 keyword is used to create a while loop, which tests a boolean expression and executes the block of statements associated with the loop if the expression evaluates to codice_37; this continues until the expression evaluates to codice_38. This keyword can also be used to create a do-while loop; see &quot;codice_146&quot;.

==Reserved Identifiers==
The following identifiers are contextual keywords, and are only restricted in some contexts:

codice_147

codice_148

;codice_149
:Used to declare that a class or interface which extends a sealed class can be extended by unknown classes.
;codice_150
;codice_151
;codice_152
:The permits clause specifies the classes that are permitted to extend a sealed class.

;codice_153
;codice_154
codice_155
;codice_156
:A sealed class or interface can only be extended or implemented by classes and interfaces permitted to do so.
;codice_157
;codice_158
;codice_159
;codice_160
:A special identifier that cannot be used as a type name (since Java 10).
;codice_161
:used as an additional check for a codice_29 statement. 
;codice_163
;codice_117
:Used to set a value for a switch expression, when using labelled statement groups (for example, codice_165).

==Reserved words for literal values==
;codice_166
:A boolean literal value.

;codice_167
:A boolean literal value.

;codice_168
:A reference literal value.

==Unused==
;codice_169
:Although reserved as a keyword in Java, codice_170 is not used and has no function. For defining constants in Java, see the codice_52 keyword.

;codice_172
:Although reserved as a keyword in Java, codice_173 is not used and has no function.

;codice_174 (added in J2SE 1.2)
:Although reserved as a keyword in Java, codice_175 is obsolete, and no longer has any function. Previously this keyword was used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations to ensure portability.

<doc id="1131138" wikidata="Q2744875" url="?curid=1131138" title="Siege of Savannah">
<text>The siege of Savannah or the second battle of Savannah was an encounter of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) in 1779. The year before, the city of Savannah, Georgia, had been captured by a British expeditionary corps under Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. The siege itself consisted of a joint Franco-American attempt to retake Savannah, from September 16 to October 18, 1779. On October 9 a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, Polish nobleman Count Casimir Pulaski, leading the combined cavalry forces on the American side, was mortally wounded. With the failure of the joint attack, the siege was abandoned, and the British remained in control of Savannah until July 1782, near the end of the war.

In 1779, more than 500 recruits from Saint-Domingue (the French colony which later became Haiti), under the overall command of French nobleman Charles Hector, Comte d&#x27;Estaing, fought alongside American colonial troops against the British Army during the siege of Savannah. This was one of the most significant foreign contributions to the American Revolutionary War. This French-colonial force had been established six months earlier and was led by white officers. Recruits came from the black population and included free men of color as well as slaves seeking their freedom in exchange for their service.

==Background==
Following the failures of military campaigns in the northern United States earlier in the American Revolutionary War, British military planners decided to embark on a southern strategy to conquer the rebellious colonies, with the support of Loyalists in the South. Their first step was to gain control of the southern ports of Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. An expedition in December 1778 took Savannah with modest resistance from ineffective militia and Continental Army defenses.

There were many reasons why the British wanted to invade the Southern colonies. Although part of America, the Southern colonies tended to be more sympathetic to the British than to the Americans. The British were hoping that ordinary citizens of the Southern colonies would continue their support of the British army during the southern campaign, as they had in prior years. Moreover, the British were promising that any enslaved African Americans who fought for the British would be given freedom, which helped gain support for the British among southern slaves. Finally, the British wanted to gain control over the South for economic reasons. The South grew many profitable crops, such as rice, indigo, and tobacco. The American revolutionaries were using the money made from those crops to buy military supplies from Europe. Taking over the south would not only isolate New England, but also give the British access to those resources.

When British generals were scouting the coast, they spotted the first French ships sailing to Charleston, South Carolina. However, General Augustin Prevost mistakenly reported that the French ships had disappeared. He did not realize that the ships he saw were the faster ships of a group sent by French general d&#x27;Estaing to tell the American army they had arrived in Georgia. Prevost had been previously informed that a French army had arrived in Georgia. However, this information was not backed up by other intelligence. As a result, the British were unprepared for a possible French attack. Most of the British troops were in Beaufort or Sunbury, and fewer men were defending Georgia.

The Continental Army regrouped, and by June 1779 the combined army and militia forces guarding Charleston numbered between 5,000 and 7,000 men. General Benjamin Lincoln, commanding those forces, knew that he could not recapture Savannah without naval assistance; for this he turned to the French, who had entered the war as an American ally in 1778.
French Admiral the Comte d&#x27;Estaing spent the first part of 1779 in the Caribbean, where his fleet and a British fleet monitored each other&#x27;s movements. He took advantage of conditions to capture Grenada in July before acceding to American requests for support in operations against Savannah. On September 3—an uncharacteristically early arrival as there was still substantial risk of seasonal hurricanes—a few French ships arrived at Charleston with news that d&#x27;Estaing was sailing for Georgia with twenty-five ships of the line and 4,000 French troops. Lincoln and the French emissaries agreed on a plan of attack on Savannah, and Lincoln left Charleston with over 2,000 men on September 11.

== Defence ==

===British defenses===
British troop strength in the area consisted of about 6,500 regulars at Brunswick, Georgia, another 900 at Beaufort, South Carolina, under Colonel John Maitland, and about 100 Loyalists at Sunbury, Georgia. General Augustine Prevost, in command of these troops from his base at Savannah, was caught unprepared when the French fleet began to arrive off Tybee Island near Savannah and recalled the troops stationed at Beaufort and Sunbury to aid in the city&#x27;s defense.

Captain Moncrief of the Royal Engineers was tasked with constructing fortifications to repulse the invaders. Using 500–800 African-American slaves working up to twelve hours per day, Moncrief constructed an entrenched defensive line, which included redoubts, nearly long, on the plains outside the city.

====Vessels====
The British Royal Navy contributed two over-age frigates, and . They landed their guns and most of their men to reinforce the land forces. In addition, the British also deployed the armed brig and the armed ship , the latter from the East Florida navy. There were two galleys, and &quot;Thunder&quot;, also from East Florida. Lastly, the British armed two merchant vessels, &quot;Savannah&quot; and &quot;Venus&quot;.

==Siege==

D&#x27;Estaing began landing troops below the city on September 12, and began moving in by September 16. Confident of victory, and believing that Maitland&#x27;s reinforcements would be prevented from reaching Savannah by Lincoln, he offered Prevost the opportunity to surrender. Prevost delayed, asking for 24 hours of truce. Owing to miscommunication about who was responsible for preventing Maitland&#x27;s movements, the waterways separating South Carolina&#x27;s Hilton Head Island from the mainland were left unguarded, and Maitland was able to reach Savannah hours before the truce ended. Prevost&#x27;s response to d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s offer was a polite refusal, despite the arrival of Lincoln&#x27;s forces.

On 19 September, as Charles-Marie de Trolong du Rumain moved his squadron up the river, he exchanged fire with &quot;Comet&quot;, &quot;Thunder&quot;, &quot;Savannah&quot;, and &quot;Venus&quot;. The next day the British scuttled &quot;Rose&quot;, which was leaking badly, just below the town to impede the French vessels from progressing further. They also burnt &quot;Savannah&quot; and &quot;Venus&quot;. By scuttling &quot;Rose&quot; in a narrow part of the channel, the British effectively blocked it. Consequently, the French fleet was unable to assist the American assault.

&quot;Germaine&quot; took up a position to protect the north side of Savannah&#x27;s defenses. &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Thunder&quot; had the mission of opposing any attempt by the South Carolinian galleys to bombard the town. Over the next few days, British shore batteries assisted &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Thunder&quot; in engagements with the two South Carolinian galleys; during one of these, they severely damaged &quot;Revenge&quot;.

The French commander, rejecting the idea of assaulting the British defenses, unloaded cannons from his ships and began a bombardment of the city. The city, rather than the entrenched defenses, bore the brunt of this bombardment, which lasted from October 3 to 8. &quot;The appearance of the town afforded a melancholy prospect, for there was hardly a house that had not been shot through&quot;, wrote one British observer.

When the bombardment failed to have the desired effect, d&#x27;Estaing changed his mind, and decided it was time to try an assault. He was motivated in part by the desire to finish the operation quickly, as scurvy and dysentery were becoming problems on his ships, and some of his supplies were running low. While a traditional siege operation would likely have succeeded eventually, it would have taken longer than d&#x27;Estaing was prepared to stay.

===Attack===

Against the advice of many of his officers, d&#x27;Estaing launched the assault against the British position on the morning of October 9. The success depended in part on the secrecy of some its aspects, which were betrayed to Prevost well before the operations were supposed to begin around 4:00 am. Fog caused troops attacking the Spring Hill redoubt to get lost in the swamps, and it was nearly daylight when the attack finally got underway. The redoubt on the right side of the British works had been chosen by the French admiral in part because he believed it to be defended only by militia. In fact, it was defended by a combination of militia and Scotsmen from John Maitland&#x27;s 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders, who had distinguished themselves at Stono Ferry. The militia included riflemen, who easily picked-off the white-clad French troops when the assault was underway. Admiral d&#x27;Estaing was twice wounded, and Polish cavalry officer Casimir Pulaski, fighting with the Americans, was mortally wounded. By the time the second wave arrived near the redoubt, the first wave was in complete disarray, and the trenches below the redoubt were filled with bodies. Attacks intended as feints against other redoubts of the British position were easily taken.

The second assault column was commanded by the Swedish Count Curt von Stedingk, who managed to reach the last trench. He later wrote in his journal, &quot;I had the pleasure of planting the American flag on the last trench, but the enemy renewed its attack and our people were annihilated by cross-fire&quot;. He was forced back by overwhelming numbers of British troops, left with some 20 men—all were wounded, including von Stedingk. He later wrote, &quot;The moment of retreat with the cries of our dying comrades piercing my heart was the bitterest of my life&quot;.

After an hour of carnage, d&#x27;Estaing ordered a retreat. On October 17, Lincoln and d&#x27;Estaing abandoned the siege.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war. While Prevost claimed Franco-American losses at 1,000 to 1,200, the actual tally of 244 killed, nearly 600 wounded and 120 taken prisoner, was severe enough. British casualties were comparatively light: 40 killed, 63 wounded, and 52 missing. Sir Henry Clinton wrote, &quot;I think that this is the greatest event that has happened the whole war,&quot; and celebratory cannons were fired when the news reached London.

It was perhaps because of the siege&#x27;s reputation as a famous British victory that Charles Dickens chose the siege of Savannah as the place for Joe Willet to be wounded (losing his arm) in the novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;.

Three currently-existing Army National Guard units (118th FA, 131st MP and 263rd ADA) are derived from American units that participated in the siege of Savannah. There are only thirty current U.S. Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

===Battlefield archaeology===
In 2005, archaeologists with the Coastal Heritage Society (CHS) and the LAMAR Institute discovered portions of the British fortifications at Spring Hill, the site of the worst part of the Franco-American attack on October 9. The find represents the first tangible remains of the battlefield. In 2008, the CHS/LAMAR Institute archaeology team discovered another segment of the British fortifications in Madison Square. A detailed report of that project is available on line in pdf format from the CHS website. CHS archaeologists are currently finalizing a follow-up grant project in Savannah, which examined several outlying portions of the battlefield. These included the position of the Saint-Domingue reserve troops at the Jewish Burying Ground west of Savannah.

An archaeology presentation and public meeting took place in February 2011 to gather suggestions for managing Savannah&#x27;s Revolutionary War battlefield resources. Archaeologist Rita Elliott from the Coastal Heritage Society revealed Revolutionary War discoveries in Savannah stemming from the two &quot;Savannah Under Fire&quot; projects conducted from 2007 to 2011. The projects uncovered startling discoveries, including trenches, fortifications, and battle debris. The research also showed that residents and tourists are interested in these sites. Archaeologists described the findings and explored ways to generate economic income which could be used for improving the quality-of-life of area residents.

The battle is commemorated each year by Presidential proclamation, on General Pulaski Memorial Day.

===Influence on Haitian revolutionaries===
The battle is much-remembered in Haitian history; the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue, consisting of some 545 &quot;gens de couleur&quot;—free men of color from Saint-Domingue—fought with the Americans.

Henri Christophe, who later declared himself to be the king of (northern) Haiti, while a republic was established in southern Haiti, was 12-years old at the time and may have been among these troops.

Many other less-famous individuals from Saint-Domingue served in this regiment and formed the officer class of the rebel armies in the Haitian Revolution, especially in the northern province around today&#x27;s Cap-Haïtien, where the unit was recruited.

<text>Club Deportivo Oriente Petrolero () is a Bolivian football club based in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. They play at the 38,000-capacity Estadio Tahuichi Aguilera. Oriente have been Bolivian champions five times, Copa Aerosur winners two times. They have also been successful in South America, by being the second Bolivian team to make the quarter-finals in Copa Libertadores.

The club had their first major success in 1971, when they won the league championship. Oriente Petrolero won several cup competitions during the 1980s, but after that did not win another major title until 1989. The past decade has been the most successful period in Oriente&#x27;s history, capped by winning La Liga titles in 2001, and 2010.

They have a longstanding rivalry with fellow Santa Cruz team Blooming.

==History==

While still in the Association of Santa Cruz, an amateur club was formed on the basis of a neighborhood team called &#x27;Oriente&#x27;, composed solely of employees of the YPFB oil company. On 5 November 1955, became its first president Elmer Saucedo Parada became the club&#x27;s first ever president.

This preparation phase lasted until the club became one of the main players in the championships of the ACF, ranking consistently among the top three.

In 1957 they won the title of first ascent two years and won their first title in First of Honor. In 1960 they were second and in 1961 they won their second title in six years after defeating Blooming 1–0 in the final.

In 1965 they placed their first ACF professional tournament, and finished in second place behind Club Destroyers. The next year the same thing happened. However, in 1967, they won their first professional title after finishing in front of their classic rival Club Blooming.

In 1971 they won their first Bolivian Primera División title. This meant they qualified for the 1972 Copa Libertadores, their first Copa Libertadores.

Oriente Petrolero has won national titles in the Bolivian league in 1979, 1990, 2001.

In 2001 Oriente renovated players, and that was one of the most important years for the club because in the Torneo Apertura 2 Oriente end up in the second place and Bolivar first. They drew with the same number of points but Bolivar won on goal differential. In the 2001 Clausura Oriente gained a berth to the Copa Libertadores by winning their third national championship and the Copa Sudamericana after finishing second in the Apertura.

In the 2002 Copa Libertadores, Oriente could not qualify for the next round after finishing last in their group, Group 2. What surprised Oriente was that they were winning by 2–0 vs Grêmio at the first half, then at the second half their goalkeeper got injured and made the team go down. The final result was 4–2.

In the 2002 Copa Sudamericana, Bolívar eliminated Oriente in the First Phase. Bolivar won the first leg 4–2. Although Oriente won the second leg 1–0, they were eliminated in aggregate score of 4–3.

In the 2002 Torneo Apertura Oriente finished in third place, so they missed a chance to qualify for Copa Sudamericana. In the Torneo Clausura Oriente finished second. However, in the aggregate table, Oriente and The Strongest drew with the same number of points so they played two games. In the first leg Oriente won 1–0 and in the second leg The Strongest won 2–1. They played an extra game because the global score was 2-2 and Oriente won on penalties to secure a place in the Copa Libertadores.

In the Copa Libertadores 2003, Oriente made the worst participation ever after finishing bottom of their group with only one point. They managed to secure a draw against Universitario of Peru.

In 2008 Oriente finished fourth in the Apertura 2008 and not gaining a place in the Copa Sudamericana or Copa Libertadores, but they had two more championships to be played. In the Clausura Oriente they could not advance to the next stage after finishing third and letting Aurora qualify.

In the Torneo Play-off Oriente at least qualified to the Loser&#x27;s round. In that round Oriente beat Aurora by 6–0, but in the final they lost against San Jose 4–2 on Aggregate.

In 2009 the Bolivian Professional Football League (LFPB) confirmed the club The Strongest as Clausura 2004 tournament champion, after five years of the challenge with which they took the title with Oriente. The League president, Mauricio Mendez said that legally the title belongs to the &quot;Aurinegra&quot;, which at that time had in its ranks the Argentine goalkeeper Marcelo Robledo, whose performance was observed by teams of Union Central and Jorge Wilstermann and arguing that no documents had realized that he was Bolivian.

This was an issue not resolved, because the board of the club showed that the goalkeeper had already won the Bolivian nationality before the High Court for Sports Discipline (TSDD), however, the title was given to another runner with Oriente Petrolero causing the controversy.

The leadership of the club called the decision as fair, because this year the La Paz team fought until the end for the title and the title was the reward for the effort of the players. In conclusion The Strongest was awarded the championship.

In 2009 Oriente was close to the title, but they could not win their last two away games against The Strongest and Bolivar. In the Clausura Oriente could advance to next stage, but in the quarter-final Oriente surprisingly knocked out Bolivar (anyway, they qualified as the best loser). In the semi-final they lost against their classic rival Blooming. Oriente gained the third place in Clausura that gave Oriente a second participation in the Copa Sudamericana.

In the Torneo Playoff Oriente eliminated their rival Blooming (Qualified to best Loser&#x27;s round), in the quarter-final Oriente eliminated San Jose. In the Semi-final Oriente was eliminated by Bolívar after drawing in two games. That year Oriente had spent a lot of money in strikers, but after two years Oriente qualified to an international cup.

Oriente began with Aerosur Cup, but were eliminated in the first stage. After being eliminated, they received an invitation from Peruvian Football Federation to participate in the Peru International Cup. On 3 February they eliminated Deportivo Garcilaso 3–2 in the semi-final and in the final they beat Cienciano 3–0 on penalties after drawing 0–0 after 90 minutes and they won their first Peru International Cup.

===Historical participation in the Copa Libertadores 1988===

In the Copa Libertadores 1988, Oriente was drawn in group 4 with: Bolívar (Bolivian rivals), Cerro Porteño, and Olimpia. Oriente finished first in the group with seven points. They began their campaign by beating fellow Bolivian rivals Bolivar 2–1 in La Paz. They then played Olimpia at home in Santa Cruz and won 1–0, and also won the away leg 2–1. They later tied at home with Cerro Porteño 2-2, although they lost the away leg in Asunción 1–0, and lost 3–1 to Bolivar at home.

In the second phase, their rival was Colo-Colo of Chile. In the first leg played on September 8 in Santa Cruz, they took advantage and won 2–1. While in the return match played on September 14 in Santiago de Chile, the match ended 0–0. They qualified to the next round.

In the quarterfinals, their opponent was América de Cali in Colombia. In the first leg played on September 21 in Santa Cruz, the game ended in a 1–1 draw. However, in the second leg played on October 28 in Cali, America won 2–0 thereby eliminating Oriente.

With this historic participation, Oriente alongside Bolívar became the second team in Bolivia that have made it to the quarterfinals of the Copa Libertadores.

<doc id="1131151" wikidata="Q131687" url="?curid=1131151" title="Heliosphere">
<text>The heliosphere is the magnetosphere, astrosphere, and outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun. It takes the shape of a vast, tailed bubble-like region of space. In plasma physics terms, it is the cavity formed by the Sun in the surrounding interstellar medium. The &quot;bubble&quot; of the heliosphere is continuously &quot;inflated&quot; by plasma originating from the Sun, known as the solar wind. Outside the heliosphere, this solar plasma gives way to the interstellar plasma permeating the Milky Way. As part of the interplanetary magnetic field, the heliosphere shields the Solar System from significant amounts of cosmic ionizing radiation; uncharged gamma rays are, however, not affected. Its name was likely coined by Alexander J. Dessler, who is credited with the first use of the word in the scientific literature in 1967. The scientific study of the heliosphere is heliophysics, which includes space weather and space climate.

Flowing unimpeded through the Solar System for billions of kilometers, the solar wind extends far beyond even the region of Pluto until it encounters the &quot;termination shock&quot;, where its motion slows abruptly due to the outside pressure of the interstellar medium. The &quot;heliosheath&quot; is a broad transitional region between the termination shock and the heliosphere&#x27;s outmost edge, the &quot;heliopause&quot;. The overall shape of the heliosphere resembles that of a comet, being roughly spherical on one side to around 100 astronomical units (AU), and on the other side being tail shaped, known as the &quot;heliotail&quot;, trailing for several thousands of AUs.

Two Voyager program spacecraft explored the outer reaches of the heliosphere, passing through the termination shock and the heliosheath. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; encountered the heliopause on 25 August 2012, when the spacecraft measured a forty-fold sudden increase in plasma density. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; traversed the heliopause on 5 November 2018. Because the heliopause marks the boundary between matter originating from the Sun and matter originating from the rest of the galaxy, spacecraft that depart the heliosphere (such as the two Voyagers) are in interstellar space.

==History==
The heliosphere is thought to change significantly over the course of millions of years due to extrasolar effects such as closer supernovas or the traversing interstellar medium of different densities. Evidence suggests that up to three million years ago Earth was exposed to the interstellar medium due to it shrinking the heliosphere to the Inner Solar System, which possibly had impacted Earth&#x27;s past climate and human evolution.

== Structure ==

Despite its name, the heliosphere&#x27;s shape is not a perfect sphere. Its shape is determined by three factors: the interstellar medium (ISM), the solar wind, and the overall motion of the Sun and heliosphere as it passes through the ISM. Because the solar wind and the ISM are both fluid, the heliosphere&#x27;s shape and size are also fluid. Changes in the solar wind, however, more strongly alter the fluctuating position of the boundaries on short timescales (hours to a few years). The solar wind&#x27;s pressure varies far more rapidly than the outside pressure of the ISM at any given location. In particular, the effect of the 11-year solar cycle, which sees a distinct maximum and minimum of solar wind activity, is thought to be significant.

On a broader scale, the motion of the heliosphere through the fluid medium of the ISM results in an overall comet-like shape. The solar wind plasma which is moving roughly &quot;upstream&quot; (in the same direction as the Sun&#x27;s motion through the galaxy) is compressed into a nearly-spherical form, whereas the plasma moving &quot;downstream&quot; (opposite the Sun&#x27;s motion) flows out for a much greater distance before giving way to the ISM, defining the long, trailing shape of the heliotail.

The limited data available and the unexplored nature of these structures have resulted in many theories as to their form. In 2020, Merav Opher led the team of researchers who determined that the shape of the heliosphere is a crescent that can be described as a deflated croissant.

===Solar wind===

The solar wind consists of particles (ionized atoms from the solar corona) and fields like the magnetic field that are produced from the Sun and stream out into space. Because the Sun rotates once approximately every 25 days, the heliospheric magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral. The solar wind affects many other systems in the Solar System; for example, variations in the Sun&#x27;s own magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind, producing geomagnetic storms in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere.
=== Heliospheric current sheet ===

The heliospheric current sheet is a ripple in the heliosphere created by the rotating magnetic field of the Sun. It marks the boundary between heliospheric magnetic field regions of opposite polarity. Extending throughout the heliosphere, the heliospheric current sheet could be considered the largest structure in the Solar System and is said to resemble a &quot;ballerina&#x27;s skirt&quot;.

== Edge structure ==
The outer structure of the heliosphere is determined by the interactions between the solar wind and the winds of interstellar space. The solar wind streams away from the Sun in all directions at speeds of several hundred km/s in the Earth&#x27;s vicinity. At some distance from the Sun, well beyond the orbit of Neptune, this supersonic wind slows down as it encounters the gases in the interstellar medium. This takes place in several stages:
* The solar wind is traveling at supersonic speeds within the Solar System. At the termination shock, a standing shock wave, the solar wind falls below the speed of sound and becomes subsonic.
* It was previously thought that once subsonic, the solar wind would be shaped by the ambient flow of the interstellar medium, forming a blunt nose on one side and comet-like heliotail behind, a region called the heliosheath. However, observations in 2009 showed that this model is incorrect. As of 2011, it is thought to be filled with a magnetic bubble &quot;foam&quot;.
* The outer surface of the heliosheath, where the heliosphere meets the interstellar medium, is called heliopause. This is the edge of the entire heliosphere. Observations in 2009 led to changes to this model.
* In theory, heliopause causes turbulence in the interstellar medium as the Sun orbits the Galactic Center. This turbulence results from the pressure of the advancing heliopause against the interstellar medium. However, the velocity of the solar wind relative to the interstellar medium may be too low for a bow shock.

=== Termination shock ===
The termination shock is the point in the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speed (relative to the Sun) because of interactions with the local interstellar medium. This causes compression, heating, and a change in the magnetic field. In the Solar System, the termination shock is believed to be 75 to 90 astronomical units from the Sun. In 2004, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; crossed the Sun&#x27;s termination shock, followed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 2007.

The shock arises because solar wind particles are emitted from the Sun at about 400 km/s, while the speed of sound (in the interstellar medium) is about 100 km/s. The exact speed depends on the density, which fluctuates considerably. The interstellar medium, although very low in density, nonetheless has a relatively constant pressure associated with it; the pressure from the solar wind decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun. As one moves far enough away from the Sun, the pressure of the solar wind drops to where it can no longer maintain supersonic flow against the pressure of the interstellar medium, at which point the solar wind slows to below its speed of sound, causing a shock wave. Further from the Sun, the termination shock is followed by heliopause, where the two pressures become equal and solar wind particles are stopped by the interstellar medium.

Other termination shocks can be seen in terrestrial systems; perhaps the easiest may be seen by simply running a water tap into a sink creating a hydraulic jump. Upon hitting the floor of the sink, the flowing water spreads out at a speed that is higher than the local wave speed, forming a disk of shallow, rapidly diverging flow (analogous to the tenuous, supersonic solar wind). Around the periphery of the disk, a shock front or wall of water forms; outside the shock front, the water moves slower than the local wave speed (analogous to the subsonic interstellar medium).

Evidence presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in May 2005 by Ed Stone suggests that the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; spacecraft passed the termination shock in December 2004, when it was about 94 AU from the Sun, by virtue of the change in magnetic readings taken from the craft. In contrast, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; began detecting returning particles when it was only 76 AU from the Sun, in May 2006. This implies that the heliosphere may be irregularly shaped, bulging outwards in the Sun&#x27;s northern hemisphere and pushed inward in the south.

=== Heliosheath ===

The heliosheath is the region of the heliosphere beyond the termination shock. Here the wind is slowed, compressed, and made turbulent by its interaction with the interstellar medium. At its closest point, the inner edge of the heliosheath lies approximately 80 to 100 AU from the Sun. A proposed model hypothesizes that the heliosheath is shaped like the coma of a comet, and trails several times that distance in the direction opposite to the Sun&#x27;s path through space. At its windward side, its thickness is estimated to be between 10 and 100 AU. Voyager project scientists have determined that the heliosheath is not &quot;smooth&quot; – it is rather a &quot;foamy zone&quot; filled with magnetic bubbles, each about 1 AU wide. These magnetic bubbles are created by the impact of the solar wind and the interstellar medium. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; began detecting evidence of the bubbles in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The probably sausage-shaped bubbles are formed by magnetic reconnection between oppositely oriented sectors of the solar magnetic field as the solar wind slows down. They probably represent self-contained structures that have detached from the interplanetary magnetic field.

At a distance of about 113 AU, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; detected a &#x27;stagnation region&#x27; within the heliosheath. In this region, the solar wind slowed to zero, the magnetic field intensity doubled and high-energy electrons from the galaxy increased 100-fold. At about 122 AU, the spacecraft entered a new region that Voyager project scientists called the &quot;magnetic highway&quot;, an area still under the influence of the Sun but with some dramatic differences.

=== Heliopause ===
The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the Sun&#x27;s solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind&#x27;s strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance. The crossing of the heliopause should be signaled by a sharp drop in the temperature of solar wind-charged particles, a change in the direction of the magnetic field, and an increase in the number of galactic cosmic rays.

In May 2012, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; detected a rapid increase in such cosmic rays (a 9% increase in a month, following a more gradual increase of 25% from January 2009 to January 2012), suggesting it was approaching the heliopause. Between late August and early September 2012, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; witnessed a sharp drop in protons from the Sun, from 25 particles per second in late August, to about 2 particles per second by early October. In September 2013, NASA announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had crossed the heliopause as of 25 August 2012. This was at a distance of from the Sun. Contrary to predictions, data from &quot;Voyager 1&quot; indicates the magnetic field of the galaxy is aligned with the solar magnetic field.

On November 5, 2018, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; mission detected a sudden decrease in the flux of low-energy ions. At the same time, the level of cosmic rays increased. This demonstrated that the spacecraft crossed the heliopause at a distance of from the Sun. Unlike &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft did not detect interstellar flux tubes while crossing the heliosheath.

NASA also collected data from the heliopause remotely during the suborbital SHIELDS mission in 2021.

=== Heliotail ===
The heliotail is the several thousand astronomical units long tail of the heliosphere, and thus the Solar System&#x27;s tail. It can be compared to the tail of a comet (however, a comet&#x27;s tail does not stretch behind it as it moves; it is always pointing away from the Sun). The tail is a region where the Sun&#x27;s solar wind slows down and ultimately escapes the heliosphere, slowly evaporating because of charge exchange.
The shape of the heliotail (newly found by NASA&#x27;s Interstellar Boundary Explorer – IBEX), is that of a four-leaf clover. The particles in the tail do not shine, therefore it cannot be seen with conventional optical instruments. IBEX made the first observations of the heliotail by measuring the energy of &quot;energetic neutral atoms&quot;, neutral particles created by collisions in the Solar System&#x27;s boundary zone.

The tail has been shown to contain fast and slow particles; the slow particles are on the side and the fast particles are encompassed in the center. The shape of the tail can be linked to the Sun sending out fast solar winds near its poles and slow solar winds near its equator more recently. The clover-shaped tail moves further away from the Sun, which makes the charged particles begin to morph into a new orientation.

&quot;Cassini&quot; and IBEX data challenged the &quot;heliotail&quot; theory in 2009. In July 2013, IBEX results revealed a 4-lobed tail on the Solar System&#x27;s heliosphere.


== Outside structures ==

The heliopause is the final known boundary between the heliosphere and the interstellar space that is filled with material, especially plasma, not from the Earth&#x27;s own star, the Sun, but from other stars. Even so, just outside the heliosphere (i.e. the &quot;solar bubble&quot;) there is a transitional region, as detected by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. Just as some interstellar pressure was detected as early as 2004, some of the Sun&#x27;s material seeps into the interstellar medium. The heliosphere is thought to reside in the Local Interstellar Cloud inside the Local Bubble, which is a region in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Outside the heliosphere, there is a forty-fold increase in plasma density. There is also a radical reduction in the detection of certain types of particles from the Sun, and a large increase in galactic cosmic rays.

The flow of the interstellar medium (ISM) into the heliosphere has been measured by at least 11 different spacecraft as of 2013. By 2013, it was suspected that the direction of the flow had changed over time. The flow, coming from Earth&#x27;s perspective from the constellation Scorpius, has probably changed direction by several degrees since the 1970s.

=== Hydrogen wall ===
Predicted to be a region of hot hydrogen, a structure called the &quot;hydrogen wall&quot; may be between the bow shock and the heliopause. The wall is composed of interstellar material interacting with the edge of the heliosphere. One paper released in 2013 studied the concept of a bow wave and hydrogen wall.

Another hypothesis suggests that the heliopause could be smaller on the side of the Solar System facing the Sun&#x27;s orbital motion through the galaxy. It may also vary depending on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium. It is known to lie far outside the orbit of Neptune. The mission of the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; spacecraft is to find and study the termination shock, heliosheath, and heliopause. Meanwhile, the IBEX mission is attempting to image the heliopause from Earth orbit within two years of its 2008 launch. Initial results (October 2009) from IBEX suggest that previous assumptions are insufficiently cognizant of the true complexities of the heliopause.

In August 2018, long-term studies about the hydrogen wall by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft confirmed results first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. Although the hydrogen is detected by extra ultraviolet light (which may come from another source), the detection by &quot;New Horizons&quot; corroborates the earlier detections by &quot;Voyager&quot; at a much higher level of sensitivity.

=== Bow shock ===
It was long hypothesized that the Sun produces a &quot;shock wave&quot; in its travels within the interstellar medium. It would occur if the interstellar medium is moving supersonically &quot;toward&quot; the Sun, since its solar wind moves &quot;away&quot; from the Sun supersonically. When the interstellar wind hits the heliosphere it slows and creates a region of turbulence. A bow shock was thought to possibly occur at about 230 AU, but in 2012 it was determined it probably does not exist. This conclusion resulted from new measurements: The velocity of the LISM (local interstellar medium) relative to the Sun&#x27;s was previously measured to be 26.3 km/s by &quot;Ulysses&quot;, whereas IBEX measured it at 23.2 km/s.

This phenomenon has been observed outside the Solar System, around stars other than the Sun, by NASA&#x27;s now retired orbital GALEX telescope. The red giant star Mira in the constellation Cetus has been shown to have both a debris tail of ejecta from the star and a distinct shock in the direction of its movement through space (at over 130 kilometers per second).

== Observational methods ==
=== Detection by spacecraft ===
The precise distance to and shape of the heliopause are still uncertain. Interplanetary/interstellar spacecraft such as &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; and &quot;New Horizons&quot; are traveling outward through the Solar System and will eventually pass through the heliopause. Contact to &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; has been lost.

==== Cassini results ====
Rather than a comet-like shape, the heliosphere appears to be bubble-shaped according to data from &quot;Cassini&quot;″s Ion and Neutral Camera (MIMI / INCA). Rather than being dominated by the collisions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium, the INCA (ENA) maps suggest that the interaction is controlled more by particle pressure and magnetic field energy density.

==== IBEX results ====
Initial data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), launched in October 2008, revealed a previously unpredicted &quot;very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky&quot;, now known as the IBEX ribbon. Initial interpretations suggest that &quot;the interstellar environment has far more influence on structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously believed&quot;
&quot;No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon, ...&quot;

&quot;The IBEX results are truly remarkable! What we are seeing in these maps does not match with any of the previous theoretical models of this region. It will be exciting for scientists to review these (ENA) maps and revise the way we understand our heliosphere and how it interacts with the galaxy.&quot; In October 2010, significant changes were detected in the ribbon after 6 months, based on the second set of IBEX observations. IBEX data did not support the existence of a bow shock, but there might be a &#x27;bow wave&#x27; according to one study.

=== Locally ===

Examples of missions that have or continue to collect data related to the heliosphere include:
* Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer
* Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
* Solar Dynamics Observatory
* STEREO
* &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft
* Parker Solar Probe

During a total eclipse the high-temperature corona can be more readily observed from Earth solar observatories. During the Apollo program the Solar wind was measured on the Moon via the Solar Wind Composition Experiment. Some examples of Earth surface based Solar observatories include the McMath–Pierce solar telescope or the newer GREGOR Solar Telescope, and the refurbished Big Bear Solar Observatory.

== Exploration history ==

The heliosphere is the area under the influence of the Sun; the two major components to determining its edge are the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind from the Sun. Three major sections from the beginning of the heliosphere to its edge are the termination shock, the heliosheath, and the heliopause. Five spacecraft have returned much of the data about its furthest reaches, including &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; (1972–1997; data to 67 AU), &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; (1973–1995; 44 AU), &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; (launched 1977, ongoing), and &quot;New Horizons&quot; (launched 2006). A type of particle called an energetic neutral atom (ENA) has also been observed to have been produced from its edges.

Except for regions near obstacles such as planets or comets, the heliosphere is dominated by material emanating from the Sun, although cosmic rays, fast-moving neutral atoms, and cosmic dust can penetrate the heliosphere from the outside. Originating at the extremely hot surface of the corona, solar wind particles reach escape velocity, streaming outwards at 300 to 800 km/s (671 thousand to 1.79 million mph or 1 to 2.9 million km/h). As it begins to interact with the interstellar medium, its velocity slows to a stop. The point where the solar wind becomes slower than the speed of sound is called the termination shock; the solar wind continues to slow as it passes through the heliosheath leading to a boundary called the heliopause, where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance. The termination shock was traversed by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 2007.

It was thought that beyond the heliopause there was a bow shock, but data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer suggested the velocity of the Sun through the interstellar medium is too low for it to form. It may be a more gentle &quot;bow wave&quot;.

&quot;Voyager&quot; data led to a new theory that the heliosheath has &quot;magnetic bubbles&quot; and a stagnation zone. Also, there were reports of a &quot;stagnation region&quot; within the heliosheath, starting around , detected by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; in 2010. There, the solar wind velocity drops to zero, the magnetic field intensity doubles, and high-energy electrons from the galaxy increase 100-fold.

Starting in May 2012 at , &quot;Voyager 1&quot; detected a sudden increase in cosmic rays, an apparent sign of approach to the heliopause. In the summer of 2013, NASA announced that&quot; Voyager 1&quot; had reached interstellar space as of 25 August 2012.

In December 2012, NASA announced that in late August 2012, Voyager 1, at about from the Sun, entered a new region they called the &quot;magnetic highway&quot;, an area still under the influence of the Sun but with some dramatic differences.

&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was launched in March 1972, and within 10 hours passed by the Moon; over the next 35 years or so the mission would be the first out, laying out many firsts of discoveries about the nature of heliosphere as well as Jupiter&#x27;s impact on it. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was the first spacecraft to detect sodium and aluminum ions in the solar wind, as well as helium in the inner Solar System. In November 1972, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; encountered Jupiter&#x27;s enormous (compared to Earth) magnetosphere and would pass in and out of it and its heliosphere 17 times charting its interaction with the solar wind. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; returned scientific data until March 1997, including data on the solar wind out to about 67 AU. It was also contacted in 2003 when it was a distance of 7.6 billion miles from Earth (82 AU), but no instrument data about the solar wind was returned then.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; surpassed the radial distance from the Sun of &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; at 69.4 AU on 17 February 1998, because it was traveling faster, gaining about 1.02 AU per year. On July 18, 2023, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; overtook &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; as the second most distant human-made object from the Sun. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, launched a year after &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, took similar data as Pioneer out to 44.7 AU in 1995 when that mission was concluded. Pioneer 11 had a similar instrument suite as 10 but also had a flux-gate magnetometer. Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft were on different trajectories and thus recorded data on the heliosphere in different overall directions away from the Sun. Data obtained from Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft helped corroborate the detection of a hydrogen wall.

In 2012 &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is thought to have passed through heliopause, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; did the same in 2018.

The twin Voyagers are the only man-made objects to have entered interstellar space. However, while they have left the heliosphere, they have not yet left the boundary of the Solar System which is considered to be the outer edge of the Oort Cloud. Upon passing the heliopause, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; Plasma Science Experiment (PLS) observed a sharp decline in the speed of solar wind particles on 5 November and there has been no sign of it since. The three other instruments on board measuring cosmic rays, low-energy charged particles, and magnetic fields also recorded the transition. The observations complement data from NASA&#x27;s IBEX mission. NASA is also preparing an additional mission, Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) which is due to launch in 2025 to capitalize on Voyager observations.

<text>Pelorus Jack (fl. 1888 – April 1912; pronounced ) was a Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;) that was famous for meeting and escorting ships through a stretch of water in Cook Strait, New Zealand. The animal was reported over a 24 year period, from 1888 until his disappearance after 1912. Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in Admiralty Bay between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near French Pass, a notoriously dangerous channel used by ships travelling between Wellington and Nelson.

While it is claimed in the British book &quot;Breverton&#x27;s nautical curiosities : a book of the sea&quot; that he was named after the pelorus, a marine navigational instrument, &quot;Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand&quot; explains that, based on local knowledge, the name came from Pelorus Sound / Te Hoiere because it was at the entrance to that stretch of water where he would regularly meet ships to accompany them.

Pelorus Jack was shot at from a passing ship, and was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law.

== Appearance ==

Pelorus Jack was approximately long and was of a white colour with grey lines or shadings, and a round, white head. Although its sex was never determined, it was identified from photographs as a Risso&#x27;s dolphin, &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;. This is an uncommon species in New Zealand waters, and only 12 Risso&#x27;s dolphins have been reported in that area.

== History ==

Pelorus Jack guided the ships by swimming alongside a water craft for 20 minutes at a time. If the crew could not see Jack at first, they often waited for him to appear.

Despite his name, he did not live in nearby Pelorus Sound / Te Hoiere; instead, he would often guide ships through dangerous passages of French Pass. However, some local residents familiar with his habits claim that he never went through French Pass itself but stayed near the Chetwode Islands.

Pelorus Jack was first seen around 1888 when he appeared in front of the schooner &quot;Brindle&quot; when the ship approached French Pass, a channel located between D&#x27;Urville Island and the South Island. When the members of the crew saw the dolphin bobbing up and down in front of the ship, they wanted to kill him, but the captain&#x27;s wife talked them out of it. To their amazement, the dolphin then proceeded to guide the ship through the narrow channel. And for years thereafter, he safely guided almost every ship that came by. With rocks and strong currents, the area is dangerous to ships, but no shipwrecks occurred when Jack was present.

Many sailors and travellers saw Pelorus Jack, and he was mentioned in local newspapers and depicted in postcards.

Jack was last seen in April 1912. There were various rumours connected to his disappearance, including fears that foreign whalers might have harpooned him. However, research suggests that Pelorus Jack was an old animal; his head was white and his body pale, both indications of age, so it is likely that he died of natural causes.

Since 1989, Pelorus Jack has been used as a symbol for the Interislander, a ferry service across the Cook Strait, and is incorporated into the livery of the ships in the fleet.

=== Shooting incident ===

In 1904, someone aboard the &quot;SS Penguin&quot; tried to shoot Pelorus Jack with a rifle. Despite the attempt on his life, Pelorus Jack continued to help ships. According to folklore, however, he no longer helped the &quot;Penguin&quot;, which shipwrecked in Cook Strait in 1909.

=== Protection ===

Following the shooting incident, a law was proposed to protect Pelorus Jack. He became protected by Order in Council under the Sea Fisheries Act on 26 September 1904. Pelorus Jack remained protected by that law until his disappearance in 1912. It is believed that he was the first individual sea creature protected by law in any country.

==Cultural references==
*In 1945, when Bob Lowry founded his new press, Pelorus Press, in Auckland, his printer&#x27;s device was a dolphin, referencing 16th century Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, and he named the press after Pelorus Jack. &quot;It was a happy thought to maintain the old dolphin tradition. What more inevitable then ... than Pelorus Jack of the Sounds?&quot;
*Kipa Hemi Whiro, a kaumātua of Ngāti Kuia is reported in 1913 as being &quot;very positive in his belief&quot; that Pelorus Jack was &quot;the self-same fish of ancient days&quot;, Kaikai-a-waro, a sea-god or taniwha who had guided his ancestor Matua-hautere across Cook Strait from the North Island to settle in the South Island many generations earlier.
*&quot;Pelorus Jack&quot; is a Scottish country dance, named in honour of the dolphin. This dance features a set of alternating tandem half-reels (or heys) where two people act as one but swap who leads at the reel ends. It is also known as a &quot;Dolphin Reel&quot;.
*Arthur Ransome mentions Pelorus Jack as accompanying ships and receiving protection in his 1932 novel &quot;Peter Duck&quot;. However, the character of Peter Duck incorrectly locates the dolphin as living in Sydney Harbour.
*The story of Pelorus Jack is (with some changes) recounted in the 1960&#x27;s &quot;Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery&quot; anthology comic series.
*Singer/songwriter Andrea Prodan tells the tale of the dolphin in the song &quot;Pelorus Jack&quot; on his 1996 all-vocal record &quot;Viva Voce&quot;.
*Two bulldogs, named Pelorus Jack I (1913–1916) and Pelorus Jack II (1916–1919), served as mascots of &quot;HMS New Zealand&quot;, the battlecruiser that the New Zealand government paid to have built for the Royal Navy.
*The Cornish poet, broadcaster and teacher Charles Causley (1917–2003) retells the story of Pelorus Jack in a 44-line, traditionally crafted poem titled &quot;Pelorus Jack&quot; in his &quot;Collected Poems 1951–2000&quot;.

<text>Lothar Malskat (May 3, 1913 – February 10, 1988) was a German painter and art restorer who repainted medieval frescoes of the Marienkirche in Lübeck, critically damaged during WWII.

== Life and career ==
Malskat was a painter from Königsberg.

===Schleswig Cathedral===
In 1937, Ernst Fey and Dietrich Fey were tasked with restoring murals in Schleswig&#x27;s Cathedral of St. Peter. The Feys hired Malskat to assist. They intended to remove August Olbers&#x27; inauthentic additions, made in a heavy-handed restoration of 1888, and restore the medieval paintings to their former glory. However, scraping away Olbers&#x27; paint removed most of the original work. Rather than admitting the problem, the Feys decided to have Malskat repaint the murals from scratch and pass off Malskat&#x27;s paintings as a restoration of the originals. However, Malskat made several anachronistic mistakes including turkeys (which were unknown in 14th century Europe) and modeling the Virgin Mary&#x27;s face after Austrian movie star Hansi Knoteck. The restoration was well received at the time. Alfred Stange, art historian at the University of Bonn, praised it as “the last, deepest, final word in German art.” 

===Marienkirche===
In 1951 he was employed by Dietrich Fey, whose firm was commissioned to restore the frescoes of cathedral of Marienkirche in Lübeck. The cathedral had been severely damaged in World War II bombings and left neglected after the war, so the medieval frescoes on its walls had nearly disappeared. The church had received donations worth DM 150,000 for restoration and Fey&#x27;s company did the work behind closed doors. The work was finished September 2, 1951.

The restorers were praised for their good work. The frescoes were unveiled during the seven-hundredth anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Marienkirche; dignitaries present included various government ministers, including Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. The West German government printed 2 million postage stamps depicting the frescoes.

The next year Malskat announced that he had painted the frescoes himself. When he was ignored, he told his own lawyer to sue both Fey and himself. Both men were eventually arrested.

===Trial===
Malskat&#x27;s trial began in 1954. Evidence included Malskat&#x27;s other forgeries of works of Marc Chagall and Toulouse-Lautrec. One estimate of the total value of his forgeries is over 15 million Euros in today&#x27;s money.

Malskat told that when the work had begun, the walls had been nearly empty of frescoes; he proved it by presenting a film depicting the unpainted walls. Instead of restoring the original frescoes, Malskat had whitewashed the walls and painted them over. Malskat had modelled various religious figures on his sister Freyda, actresses like Marlene Dietrich and even historical figures like Rasputin.

Fey was sentenced for 20 months and Malskat for 18.

===Later life===
After Malskat was released, he began to paint in his own name. He painted decorations on restaurants and inns, including the Tre Kronor Inn in Stockholm. He also arranged exhibitions of his works in northern Germany. He died in Wulfsdorf near Lübeck, and was buried in Burgtorfriedhof.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalised version of Malskat&#x27;s painting of the Marienkirche frescoes appears in the Günter Grass novel &quot;The Rat&quot;. Malskat&#x27;s forgeries are a major theme of the novel, as a symbol of the alleged corruption of post-war Germany.

<text>GameMonkey Script is a small, cross-platform scripting language designed for embedding into games. GameMonkey bears many similarities to Lua, except the syntax is more similar to that of C.

== History ==
GameMonkey Script was written in 2002 by Matthew Riek and Greg Douglas as part of a closed-source project for Auran Development. However, on 12 June 2003 Auran granted license for the full source code of GameMonkey to be released to the public under the MIT License. It is currently being used in commercial and hobby applications on a wide range of machines, from the Windows PC, Apple Mac, and Microsoft Xbox to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii and various distributions of Linux.

== Features ==
* A cross-platform machine library
* C-style syntax
* A small memory footprint (~50 KB)
* Soft, real-time incremental garbage collection (&quot;no reference counting)&quot;
* Native threading
* Full implementation of states
* Simple binding with C++ code
* Debugger support (with supplied debugger)

Like Lua, the primary data structure in GameMonkey Script is the table. Tables allow for a variety of other data structures to be created; from arrays, sets, hashmaps, lists and records. They can also be used to simulate namespaces and C++ class structures, containing both functions and properties.

<doc id="1131162" wikidata="Q2635601" url="?curid=1131162" title="Maria Bochkareva">
<text>María Leontievna Bochkareva (July 1889 – 16 May 1920; , née &quot;Frolkova&quot; (Фролко́ва), nicknamed &quot;Yashka&quot;) was a Russian soldier who fought in World War I and formed the Women&#x27;s Battalion. She was the first Russian woman to command a military unit.

==Early life==
Maria Frolkova was born to a peasant family in the village of Nikolskoye in July 1889. Her father was a sergeant in the imperial army who fought in the Russo-Turkish War. She left home at sixteen to marry Afanasy Bochkarev. They moved to Tomsk, Siberia, where they worked as labourers. Her husband abused her, causing her to leave him. She found a job as a servant to employers who coerced her into working in their brothel. They moved her to Sretensk where Maria began a relationship with a local Jewish man named Yakov (or Yankel) Buk. She and Buk opened a butcher shop, but in May 1912 Buk was arrested for larceny and sent to Yakutsk. Bochkareva followed him into exile, primarily on foot, where the couple established another butcher shop. Buk was caught stealing again and sent to Amga in 1913. Once again Bochkareva followed him. Buk began drinking heavily and became abusive.

==Military career==

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Bochkareva left Buk and returned to Tomsk. In November, she was rejected by the 25th Tomsk Reserve Battalion of the Imperial Russian Army. The commander suggested that she try joining the Red Cross instead. When she insisted that she wanted to fight with the men, the commander helped her compose a telegram to Tsar Nicholas II requesting his personal permission. When she obtained his approval, she underwent three months&#x27; training and was sent to front-line duty with the 5th Corps, 28th Regiment of the Second Army, stationed at Polotsk. She was decorated for rescuing fifty wounded soldiers from the field.

After she was wounded in the arm and leg, Bochkareva worked as a medical sister until she returned to the front as a corporal in charge of eleven men.

She suffered another injury that left her paralyzed for four months. After she recovered, she returned to the front as a senior non-commissioned officer delivering supplies to a platoon of seventy men. Men of the regiment treated her with ridicule or sexually harassed her until she proved her courage in battle. Eventually, she became exhausted from her physical injuries and lost interest in her military post. She was discharged in the spring of 1917.
After the abdication of the Tsar in early 1917 due to the February Revolution, she proposed to Mikhail Rodzianko the creation of an all-female combat unit that she claimed would fix the Army&#x27;s morale problem. She believed that it would shame the men into again supporting the war effort. Once she agreed to lead the unit, her proposal was approved by Army Commander-in-Chief Brusilov, and she approached Minister of War Alexander Kerensky. Although female recruitment went against army regulations, the all-female battalion was granted special dispensation. This was the first women&#x27;s battalion to be organised in Russia. Bochkareva&#x27;s &quot;1st Russian Women&#x27;s Battalion of Death&quot; initially attracted around 2,000 women volunteers, but the commander&#x27;s strict discipline drove all but around 300 out of the unit.

The rushed training of the battalion was led by twenty-five male instructors from the Volunskii Regiment of the Petrograd Military District. The battalion was blessed at Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral on June 25, 1917. After a month of training, Bochkareva and her unit became attached to the First Siberian Corps and was sent to the Russian western front to participate in the Kerensky Offensive, where Bochkareva was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. The unit was involved in one major battle—near the town of Smarhon. The women of the unit performed well in combat, but the vast majority of male soldiers, already demoralised, had little inclination to fight. Bochkareva herself was wounded in the battle and sent back to Petrograd to recuperate.

Bochkareva was only marginally involved in the creation of other women&#x27;s combat units formed in Russia during the spring and summer of 1917. Her unit was at the front at the time of the October Revolution and did not participate in the defence of the Winter Palace—another women&#x27;s unit did, the 1st Petrograd Women&#x27;s Battalion. Bochkareva&#x27;s unit disbanded after facing increasing hostility from the remaining male troops at the front. Bochkareva returned to Petrograd where she was briefly detained by the Bolsheviks. She secured permission to rejoin her family in Tomsk but returned to Petrograd again in early 1918. She claims to have then received a telegram asking her to take a message to General Lavr Kornilov, who was commanding a White Army in the Caucasus. After leaving Kornilov&#x27;s headquarters, she was again detained by the Bolsheviks and, after they learned of her connection with the Whites, was scheduled to be executed. She was rescued, however, by a soldier who had served with her in the Imperial Army in 1915 and who convinced the Bolsheviks to stay her execution. She was granted an external passport and allowed to leave the country. Bochkareva then made her way to Vladivostok, where she left for the United States on the U.S. Army Transport &quot;Sheridan&quot; on 18 April 1918.

==United States and Britain==
Sponsored by socialite Florence Harriman, Bochkareva arrived in San Francisco and made her way to New York City and Washington, D.C. She was granted a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson on July 10, 1918, during which she begged the president to intervene in Russia. Wilson was apparently so moved by her emotional appeal that he responded with tears in his eyes and promised to do what he could.

While in New York, Bochkareva dictated her memoirs, &quot;Yashka: My Life As Peasant, Exile, and Soldier&quot;, to a Russian emigre journalist named Isaac Don Levine. After leaving the United States, she traveled to Great Britain where she was granted an audience with King George V. The British War Office gave her 500 rubles of funding to return to Russia.

==Return to Russia and execution==
Bochkareva arrived in Arkhangelsk in August 1918 and attempted to organise another unit, but failed.

In April 1919, she returned to Tomsk and attempted to form a women&#x27;s medical detachment under White Army Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, but before she could complete this task she was recaptured by the Bolsheviks. She was sent to Krasnoyarsk where she was interrogated for four months. Ultimately, she was sentenced to death and executed as an &quot;enemy of the working class&quot;. She was shot by the Cheka on May 16, 1920.

==Legacy==
Maria Bochkareva is one of the heroines of the Russian film &quot;Battalion&quot; directed by Dmitriy Meskhiev and released to cinemas in February 2015.

In 2018 the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her.

<text>Algoth Niska (5 December 1888 – 28 May 1954) was a Finnish bootlegger, footballer and adventurer.

==Biography==
Niska was born in Viipuri in 1888 and was the youngest child. When his father died in 1903, the family moved to Helsinki, where he got interested in football. He was a member of the Finland football team which played at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, losing 4–0 to England in the semi-final.

Niska joined his first ship in 1908. When the First World War broke out, he went to navigation school and graduated the following year, though he never got his papers. He was married twice and divorced both women; he had two children. The well-known Finnish musician Ilkka Lipsanen is his grandson.

In 1919, when Finnish prohibition came into force, he acquired a large supply of now-illegal liquor. High society in Helsinki soon found out whom they could ask for refreshments. When the supply begun to run out, he bought a boat and begun to smuggle liquor from Estonian and German ships who waited outside Finnish territorial waters. Later he also smuggled liquor from Sweden, where it was legal but tightly controlled.

Over the years, he used various tricks to dodge police boats – and sometimes the bullets of their machine guns – during his trips between Turku, Helsinki, Tallinn and Stockholm and in the Åland archipelago. He never shot back. In one case, he unloaded his cargo right in the heart of Helsinki while people were distracted during the visit of Gustav V of Sweden. At one stage, he was sentenced to a year in prison for resisting police, although he claimed to be innocent of this charge.

Niska was eventually wanted both in Sweden and Finland. He was sentenced for short periods in both countries. In prison, he became a model prisoner and was often released early for good behavior.

In 1932, Niska was exiled from Sweden and he spent time in Riga, Tallinn and Danzig. He spoke at least Finnish, Swedish, German and English.

In 1938, prior to World War II, Niska began to smuggle something else – Jewish refugees from Germany to the relative neutrality of Finland. His own estimate was 151 Jews. He used stolen and forged passports and various devious plots to get Jews from Germany through the Netherlands and Estonia. Reportedly he sometimes refused payment. When his network was exposed in 1939, he fled to Estonia and found that the Soviet Union had occupied the country. According to his own story, he fled back to Finland in a rowing boat.

Niska fought in Laatokka during the Winter War. There is no clear knowledge of what he did during the Continuation War.

In the mid-1940s, Niska tried to finance the building of a new boat by giving interviews about his life – he needed the money and knew he could afford to ask. In 1951, Niska went through surgery in Antwerp but did not pay the bill – he was in serious debt in that time. In 1953, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost his speech and power of movement. He died on 28 May 1954.

==Publications==
He wrote two books, &quot;Yli vihreän rajan&quot; (&quot;Over the green border&quot;) and &quot;Mina äventyr&quot; (&quot;My adventures&quot;). One biography is available, Kari Kallonen&#x27;s &quot;Algoth Niska - Salakuljettajien kuningas&quot; (&quot;Algoth Niska - King of Smugglers&quot;) Revontuli 2000.

<text>USS &quot;Charr&quot; (SS/AGSS-328), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the charr.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally named &quot;Bocaccio&quot;, SS-328 was renamed &quot;Charr&quot; on 24 September 1942 and launched 28 May 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut, sponsored by Mrs. W. F. Orkney; and commissioned 23 September 1944.

==First war patrol, December 1944 – March 1945==

Pacific-bound, &quot;Charr&quot; cleared New London 5 November 1944, and reached Pearl Harbor 9 December. On 30 December, she was bound for action waters, as she sailed on her first war patrol off the northeast coast of Indo-China. On 29 January 1945, daring to lie at anchor in broad daylight for 4 hours one mile (1.6 km) off the coast, &quot;Charr&quot; sent two men ashore in a rubber boat to rescue a downed aviator. A second rescue mission came at the close of her patrol, when she escorted the badly damaged Dutch submarine HNLMS &quot;Zwaardvisch&quot; through the Java Sea and Lombok Straits to Fremantle, Australia, where the two submarines arrived 3 March.

==Second war patrol, March – May 1945==

After refit, &quot;Charr&quot; cleared on her second war patrol, cruising in the Flores, Java, and South China Seas, and along the southern coast of Taiwan. She sailed for part of the patrol in coordination with and , and with them conducted an epic 4-day chase of the Japanese cruiser &quot;Isuzu&quot; and her three escorts. Finally, early in the morning of 7 April 1945, &quot;Charr&quot; maneuvered into firing position to find &quot;Isuzu&quot; down by the stern and listing, evidence of successful attack by &quot;Gabilan&quot;. &quot;Charr&quot; fired a spread of torpedoes, scoring three hits to send the cruiser to the bottom.

Three days later, 10 April 1945, &quot;Charr&quot; made contact with another target, a coastal freighter, which she sank on the surface by gunfire. The submarine then headed on for a dangerous assignment, calling for intricate maneuvering, when she laid a minefield off Pulo Island on 14 April and 15 April. She put in at Subic Bay from 20 to 24 April to reload torpedoes, then sailed on to patrol off Formosa on lifeguard duty, during which she rescued one downed pilot.

==Third war patrol, June – July 1945==

After refitting at Subic Bay from 21 May to 14 June 1945, &quot;Charr&quot; put out on her third war patrol, cruising in the Gulf of Siam with three other submarines. At this late date in the war, targets were few, for &quot;Charr&quot;&#x27;s sister submarines, as well as air and surface forces, had broken the back of Japan&#x27;s navy and merchant fleet. The wolf pack however, did find a target in the &quot;I-351&quot; on 15 July. After &quot;Charr&quot; and the other wolfpack members had aided in cornering the Japanese submarine, sent her to the bottom.

==Post-war service==

&quot;Charr&quot; remained at Fremantle from 26 July to 29 August 1945, then sailed for repairs at Pearl Harbor and training at Guam until 30 January 1946 when she reached San Diego, her newly assigned home port. From this port, she made simulated war patrols to the Far East in 1947 and 1948, operating along the West Coast at other times. On several occasions, she carried members of the Naval Reserve on 2-week cruises, and assisted with training for briefer periods from 1949 through July 1951 when she entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a &quot;Fleet Snorkel&quot; conversion which streamlined her appearance and equipped her with a snorkel, thus enhancing her underwater cruising range.

With her conversion completed 19 November 1951, she prepared for overseas deployment, and on 26 March 1952, she sailed to support United Nations forces in Korea, conducting patrols throughout the Far East. She returned to San Diego 2 October 1952 for local operations, which continued to include occasional training cruises for the Naval Reserve.

&quot;Charr&quot; again cruised in the Far East from 11 June to 7 December 1954, training air and surface forces in antisubmarine warfare, and conducting patrols. On 9 November, she played hostess to Chiang Kai-shek on his first cruise in a submarine. Upon her return to the west coast, she resumed her normal operating schedule, and did not return to the western Pacific again until 22 March 1957 to 14 October 1957. A highlight of her next period of service was an exercise with ships of the Canadian Navy in the fall of 1958, which was followed by preparations for her 1959 Far Eastern cruise, completed between 6 May and 28 October. Through 1960, she continued operations from San Diego.

On 26 September 1961, a broken coupling allowed sea water to flood the engine room of the &quot;Charr&quot; while submerged to 100 feet 150 miles off the coast of California. Heroic crewmen sealed themselves in the engine room and maintained power to rapidly bring the &quot;Charr&quot; to the surface. That incident made the news and headlines of the day and the two crewmen received Navy Commendations.

&quot;Charr&quot; was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine (AGSS-328) in 1966. She was decommissioned, 28 June 1969, stricken from the Naval Register, 20 December 1971, and sold for scrap, 17 August 1972.

==Honors and awards==
Of &quot;Charr&quot;&#x27;s three war patrols, the second was designated a &quot;successful war patrol&quot;, for which she received one battle star.

<text>American Jews () or Jewish Americans are American citizens who are Jewish, whether by culture, ethnicity, or religion. According to a 2020 poll conducted by Pew Research, approximately two thirds of American Jews identify as Ashkenazi, 3% identify as Sephardic, and 1% identify as Mizrahi. An additional 6% identify as some combination of the three categories, and 25% do not identify as any particular category.

During the colonial era, Sephardic Jews who arrived via Portugal represented the bulk of America&#x27;s then-small Jewish population. While their descendants are a minority nowadays, they represent the remainder of those original American Jews along with an array of other Jewish communities, including more recent Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Beta Israel-Ethiopian Jews, various other Jewish ethnic groups, as well as a smaller number of gerim (converts). The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions, encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance.

Depending on religious definitions and varying population data, the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world, after Israel. As of 2020, the American Jewish population is estimated at 7.5 million people, accounting for 2.4% of the total US population. This includes 4.2 million adults who identify their religion as Jewish, 1.5 million Jewish adults who identify with no religion, and 1.8 million Jewish children. It is estimated that up to 15 million Americans are part of the &quot;enlarged&quot; American Jewish population, accounting for 4.5% of the total US population, consisting of those who have at least one Jewish grandparent and would be eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return.

==History==

Jews were present in the Thirteen Colonies since the mid-17th century. However, they were few in number, with at most 200 to 300 having arrived by 1700. Those early arrivals were mostly Sephardi Jewish immigrants, of Western Sephardic (also known as Spanish and Portuguese Jewish) ancestry, but by 1720, Ashkenazi Jews from diaspora communities in Central and Eastern Europe predominated.

For the first time, the English Plantation Act 1740 permitted Jews to become British citizens and emigrate to the colonies. The first famous Jew in US history was Chaim Salomon, a Polish-born Jew who emigrated to New York and played an important role in the American Revolution. He was a successful financier who supported the patriotic cause and helped raise most of the money needed to finance the American Revolution.

Despite the fact that some of them were denied the right to vote or hold office in local jurisdictions, Sephardi Jews became active in community affairs in the 1790s, after they were granted political equality in the five states where they were most numerous. Until about 1830, Charleston, South Carolina had more Jews than anywhere else in North America. Large-scale Jewish immigration commenced in the 19th century, when, by mid-century, many German Jews had arrived, migrating to the United States in large numbers due to antisemitic laws and restrictions in their countries of birth. They primarily became merchants and shop-owners. Gradually early Jewish arrivals from the east coast would travel westward, and in the fall of 1819 the first Jewish religious services west of the Appalachian Range were conducted during the High Holidays in Cincinnati, the oldest Jewish community in the Midwest. Gradually the Cincinnati Jewish community would adopt novel practices under the leadership Rabbi Isaac Meyer Wise, the father of Reform Judaism in the United States, such as the inclusion of women in &quot;minyan&quot;. A large community grew in the region with the arrival of German and Lithuanian Jews in the latter half of the 1800s, leading to the establishment of Manischewitz, one of the largest producers of American kosher products and now based in New Jersey, and the oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the United States, and second-oldest continuous published in the world, &quot;The American Israelite&quot;, established in 1854 and still extant in Cincinnati. By 1880 there were approximately 250,000 Jews in the United States, many of them being the educated, and largely secular, German Jews, although a minority population of the older Sephardi Jewish families remained influential.

Jewish migration to the United States increased dramatically in the early 1880s, as a result of persecution and economic difficulties in parts of Eastern Europe. Most of these new immigrants were Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom arrived from poor diaspora communities of the Russian Empire and the Pale of Settlement, located in modern-day Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. During the same period, great numbers of Ashkenazic Jews also arrived from Galicia, at that time the most impoverished region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with a heavy Jewish urban population, driven out mainly by economic reasons. Many Jews also emigrated from Romania. Over 2,000,000 Jews landed between the late 19th century and 1924 when the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration. Most settled in the New York metropolitan area, establishing the world&#x27;s major concentrations of the Jewish population. In 1915, the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition, thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines in Yiddish.

At the beginning of the 20th century, these newly arrived Jews built support networks consisting of many small synagogues and &quot;Landsmanshaften&quot; (German and Yiddish for &quot;Countryman Associations&quot;) for Jews from the same town or village. American Jewish writers of the time urged assimilation and integration into the wider American culture, and Jews quickly became part of American life. Approximately 500,000 American Jews (or half of all Jewish males between 18 and 50) fought in World War II, and after the war younger families joined the new trend of suburbanization. There, Jews became increasingly assimilated and demonstrated rising intermarriage. The suburbs facilitated the formation of new centers, as Jewish school enrollment more than doubled between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s, while synagogue affiliation jumped from 20% in 1930 to 60% in 1960; the fastest growth came in Reform and, especially, Conservative congregations. More recent waves of Jewish emigration from Russia and other regions have largely joined the mainstream American Jewish community.

Americans of Jewish descent have been successful in many fields and aspects over the years. The Jewish community in America has gone from being part of the lower class of society, with numerous employments barred to them, to being a group with a high concentrations in members of the academia and a per capita income higher than the average in the United States.

===Self-identity===
Scholars debate whether the historical experience of Jews in the United States has been such a unique experience as to validate American exceptionalism. Korelitz (1996) shows how American Jews during the late 19th and early 20th centuries abandoned a racial definition of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity. The key to understanding this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one can be found in the &quot;Menorah Journal&quot; between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a cultural, rather than a racial, religious, or other views of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by Horace M. Kallen and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.

Siporin (1990) uses the family folklore of ethnic Jews to their collective history and its transformation into a historical art form. They tell us how Jews have survived being uprooted and transformed. Many immigrant narratives bear a theme of the arbitrary nature of fate and the reduced state of immigrants in a new culture. By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnicity more in charge of his life, and perhaps in danger of losing his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities. After 1960, memories of the Holocaust, together with the Six-Day War in 1967 had major impacts on fashioning Jewish ethnic identity. Some have argued that the Holocaust highlighted for Jews the importance of their ethnic identity at a time when other minorities were asserting their own. The world&#x27;s largest Jewish gathering outside of Israel occurred in Edison, central New Jersey, on December 1, 2024.

===Politics===


In New York City, while the German-Jewish community was well established &#x27;uptown&#x27;, the more numerous Jews who migrated from Eastern Europe faced tension &#x27;downtown&#x27; with Irish and German Catholic neighbors, especially the Irish Catholics who controlled Democratic Party politics at the time. Jews successfully established themselves in the garment trades and in the needle unions in New York. By the 1930s they were a major political factor in New York, with strong support for the most liberal programs of the New Deal. They continued as a major element of the New Deal Coalition, giving special support to the Civil Rights Movement. By the mid-1960s, however, the Black Power movement caused a growing separation between blacks and Jews, though both groups remained solidly in the Democratic camp.

While earlier Jewish immigrants from Germany tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Jews from Eastern Europe starting in the early 1880s were generally more liberal or left-wing and became the political majority. Many came to America with experience in the socialist, anarchist and communist movements as well as the Labor Bund, emanating from Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century American labor movement and helped to found unions that played a major role in left-wing politics and, after 1936, in Democratic Party politics.

Although American Jews generally leaned Republican in the second half of the 19th century, the majority has voted Democratic since at least 1916, when they voted 55% for Woodrow Wilson.

With the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, American Jews voted more solidly Democratic. They voted 90% for Roosevelt in the elections of 1940, and 1944, representing the highest of support, equaled only once since. In the election of 1948, Jewish support for Democrat Harry S. Truman dropped to 75%, with 15% supporting the new Progressive Party. As a result of lobbying, and hoping to better compete for the Jewish vote, both major party platforms had included a pro-Zionist plank since 1944, and supported the creation of a Jewish state; it had little apparent effect however, with 90% still voting other-than-Republican. In every election since, except for 1980, no Democratic presidential candidate has won with less than 67% of the Jewish vote. (In 1980, Carter obtained 45% of the Jewish vote. See below.)

During the 1952 and 1956 elections, Jewish voters cast 60% or more of their votes for Democrat Adlai Stevenson, while General Eisenhower garnered 40% of the Jewish vote for his reelection, the best showing to date for the Republicans since Warren G. Harding&#x27;s 43% in 1920. In 1960, 83% voted for Democrat John F. Kennedy against Richard Nixon, and in 1964, 90% of American Jews voted for Lyndon Johnson, over his Republican opponent, arch-conservative Barry Goldwater. Hubert Humphrey garnered 81% of the Jewish vote in the 1968 elections in his losing bid for president against Richard Nixon.

During the Nixon re-election campaign of 1972, Jewish voters were apprehensive about George McGovern and only favored the Democrat by 65%, while Nixon more than doubled Republican Jewish support to 35%. In the election of 1976, Jewish voters supported Democrat Jimmy Carter by 71% over incumbent president Gerald Ford&#x27;s 27%, but during the Carter re-election campaign of 1980, Jewish voters greatly abandoned the Democrat, with only 45% support, while Republican winner Ronald Reagan garnered 39%, and 14% went to independent (former Republican) John Anderson.

During the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984, the Republican retained 31% of the Jewish vote, while 67% voted for Democrat Walter Mondale. The 1988 election saw Jewish voters favor Democrat Michael Dukakis by 64%, while George H. W. Bush polled a respectable 35%, but during Bush&#x27;s re-election attempt in 1992, his Jewish support dropped to just 11%, with 80% voting for Bill Clinton and 9% going to independent Ross Perot. Clinton&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1996 maintained high Jewish support at 78%, with 16% supporting Bob Dole and 3% for Perot.

In the 2000 presidential election, Joe Lieberman became the first American Jew to run for national office on a major-party ticket when he was chosen as Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore&#x27;s vice-presidential nominee. The elections of 2000 and 2004 saw continued Jewish support for Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry, a Catholic, remain in the high- to mid-70% range, while Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s re-election in 2004 saw Jewish support rise from 19% to 24%.

In the 2008 presidential election, 78% of Jews voted for Barack Obama, who became the first African American to be elected president. Additionally, 83% of white Jews voted for Obama compared to just 34% of white Protestants and 47% of white Catholics, though 67% of those identifying with another religion and 71% identifying with no religion also voted Obama.

In the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic Primary, Bernie Sanders became the first Jewish candidate to win a state&#x27;s presidential primary election.

For congressional and senate races, since 1968, American Jews have voted about 70–80% for Democrats; this support increased to 87% for Democratic House candidates during the 2006 elections.

The first American Jew to serve in the Senate was David Levy Yulee, who was Florida&#x27;s first Senator, serving 1845–1851 and again 1855–1861.

There were 19 Jews among the 435 US Representatives at the start of the 112th Congress; 26 Democrats and 1 (Eric Cantor) Republican. While many of these Members represented coastal cities and suburbs with significant Jewish populations, others did not (for instance, Kim Schrier of Seattle, Washington; John Yarmuth of Louisville, Kentucky; and David Kustoff and Steve Cohen of Memphis, Tennessee). The total number of Jews serving in the House of Representatives declined from 31 in the 111th Congress. John Adler of New Jersey, Steve Kagan of Wisconsin, Alan Grayson of Florida, and Ron Klein of Florida all lost their re-election bids, Rahm Emanuel resigned to become the President&#x27;s Chief of Staff; and Paul Hodes of New Hampshire did not run for re-election but instead (unsuccessfully) sought his state&#x27;s open Senate seat. David Cicilline of Rhode Island was the only Jewish American who was newly elected to the 112th Congress; he had been the Mayor of Providence. The number declined when Jane Harman, Anthony Weiner, and Gabby Giffords resigned during the 112th Congress.

, there were five openly gay men serving in Congress, and two are Jewish: Jared Polis of Colorado and David Cicilline of Rhode Island.

In November 2008, Cantor was elected as the House Minority Whip, the first Jewish Republican to be selected for the position. In 2011, he became the first Jewish House Majority Leader. He served as Majority Leader until 2014, when he resigned shortly after his loss in the Republican primary election for his House seat.

In 2013, Pew found that 70% of American Jews identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party, with just 22% identifying with or leaning toward the Republican Party.

The 114th Congress included 10 Jews among 100 U.S. Senators: nine Democrats (Michael Bennet, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz, Benjamin Cardin, Dianne Feinstein, Jon Ossoff, Jacky Rosen, Charles Schumer, Ron Wyden), and Bernie Sanders, who became a Democrat to run for President but returned to the Senate as an Independent.

In the 118th Congress, there are 28 Jewish US Representatives. 25 are Democrats and the other 3 are Republicans. All 10 Jewish Senators are Democrats.

Additionally, 6 members of President Joe Biden&#x27;s cabinet are Jewish (Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland, DNI Avril Haines, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen).

===Participation in civil rights movements===
Members of the American Jewish community have included prominent participants in civil rights movements. In the mid-20th century, there were American Jews who were among the most active participants in the Civil Rights Movement and feminist movements. A number of American Jews have also been active figures in the struggle for gay rights in America.

Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress, stated the following when he spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous March on Washington on August 28, 1963: &quot;As Jews we bring to this great demonstration, in which thousands of us proudly participate, a twofold experience—one of the spirit and one of our history... From our Jewish historic experience of three and a half thousand years we say: Our ancient history began with slavery and the yearning for freedom. During the Middle Ages my people lived for a thousand years in the ghettos of Europe... It is for these reasons that it is not merely sympathy and compassion for the black people of America that motivates us. It is, above all and beyond all such sympathies and emotions, a sense of complete identification and solidarity born of our own painful historic experience.&quot;

===The Holocaust===
During the World War II period, the American Jewish community was bitterly and deeply divided and as a result, it was unable to form a united front. Most Jews who had previously emigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe supported Zionism, because they believed that a return to their ancestral homeland was the only solution to the persecution and the genocide which were then occurring across Europe. One important development was the sudden conversion of many American Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war. The Holocaust was largely ignored by American media as it was happening. Reporters and editors largely did not believe the stories of atrocities which were coming out of Europe.

The Holocaust had a profound impact on the Jewish community in the United States, especially after 1960 as Holocaust education improved, as Jews tried to comprehend what had happened during it, and especially as they tried to commemorate it and grapple with it when they looked to the future. Abraham Joshua Heschel summarized this dilemma when he attempted to understand Auschwitz: &quot;To try to answer is to commit a supreme blasphemy. Israel enables us to bear the agony of Auschwitz without radical despair, to sense a ray [of] God&#x27;s radiance in the jungles of history.&quot;

===International affairs===
Zionism became a well-organized movement in the U.S. with the involvement of leaders such as Louis Brandeis and the promise of a reconstituted homeland in the Balfour Declaration. Jewish Americans organized large-scale boycotts of German merchandise during the 1930s to protest Nazi Germany. Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s leftist domestic policies received strong Jewish support in the 1930s and 1940s, as did his anti-Nazi foreign policy and his promotion of the United Nations. Support for political Zionism in this period, although growing in influence, remained a distinctly minority opinion among Jews in the United States until about 1944–45, when the early rumors and reports of the systematic mass murder of the Jews in Nazi-occupied countries became publicly known with the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. The founding of the modern State of Israel in 1948 and recognition thereof by the American government (following objections by American isolationists) was an indication of both its intrinsic support and its response to learning the horrors of the Holocaust.

This attention was based on a natural affinity toward and support for Israel in the Jewish community. The attention is also because of the ensuing and unresolved conflicts regarding the founding of Israel and the role for the Zionist movement going forward. A lively internal debate commenced, following the Six-Day War. The American Jewish community was divided over whether or not they agreed with the Israeli response; the great majority came to accept the war as necessary. Similar tensions were aroused by the 1977 election of Menachem Begin and the rise of Revisionist policies, the 1982 Lebanon War and the continuing administrative governance of portions of the West Bank territory. Disagreement over Israel&#x27;s 1993 acceptance of the Oslo Accords caused a further split among American Jews; this mirrored a similar split among Israelis and led to a parallel rift within the pro-Israel lobby, and even ultimately to the United States for its &quot;blind&quot; support of Israel. Abandoning any pretense of unity, both segments began to develop separate advocacy and lobbying organizations. The liberal supporters of the Oslo Accord worked through Americans for Peace Now (APN), Israel Policy Forum (IPF) and other groups friendly to the Labour government in Israel. They tried to assure Congress that American Jewry was behind the Accord and defended the efforts of the administration to help the fledgling Palestinian Authority (PA), including promises of financial aid. In a battle for public opinion, IPF commissioned a number of polls showing widespread support for Oslo among the community.

In opposition to Oslo, an alliance of conservative groups, such as the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), Americans For a Safe Israel (AFSI), and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) tried to counterbalance the power of the liberal Jews. On October 10, 1993, the opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli accord organized at the American Leadership Conference for a Safe Israel, where they warned that Israel was prostrating itself before &quot;an armed thug&quot;, and predicted and that the &quot;thirteenth of September is a date that will live in infamy&quot;. Some Zionists also criticized, often in harsh language, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, his foreign minister and chief architect of the peace accord. With the community so strongly divided, AIPAC and the Presidents Conference, which was tasked with representing the national Jewish consensus, struggled to keep the increasingly antagonistic discourse civil. Reflecting these tensions, Abraham Foxman from the Anti-Defamation League was asked by the conference to apologize for criticizing ZOA&#x27;s Morton Klein. The conference, which under its organizational guidelines was in charge of moderating communal discourse, reluctantly censured some Orthodox spokespeople for attacking Colette Avital, the Labor-appointed Israeli Consul General in New York and an ardent supporter of that version of a peace process.

==Demographics==

As of 2020, the American Jewish population is, depending on the method of identification, either the largest in the world, or the second-largest in the world (after Israel). Precise population figures vary depending on whether Jews are accounted for based on halakhic considerations, or secular, political and ancestral identification factors. There were about four million adherents of Judaism in the US as of 2001, approximately 1.4% of the US population. According to the Jewish Agency, for the year 2023 Israel was home to 7.2 million Jews (46% of the world&#x27;s Jewish population), while the United States contained 6.3 million (40.1%).

According to Gallup and Pew Research Center findings, &quot;at maximum 2.2% of the US adult population has some basis for Jewish self-identification.&quot; In 2020, the demographers Arnold Dashefsky and Ira M. Sheskin estimated in the American Jewish Yearbook that the American Jewish population totaled 7.15 million, making up 2.17% of the country&#x27;s 329.5 million inhabitants. In the same year, the American Jewish population was estimated at 7.6 million people, accounting for 2.4% of the total US population, by other organization. This includes 4.9 million adults who identify their religion as Jewish, 1.2 million Jewish adults who identify with no religion, and 1.6 million Jewish children.

The &quot;American Jewish Yearbook population survey&quot; had placed the number of American Jews at 6.4 million, or approximately 2.1% of the total population. This figure is significantly higher than the previous large scale survey estimate, conducted by the 2000–2001 National Jewish Population estimates, which estimated 5.2 million Jews. A 2007 study released by the Steinhardt Social Research Institute (SSRI) at Brandeis University presents evidence to suggest that both these figures may be underestimations with a potential 7.0–7.4 million Americans of Jewish descent. Those higher estimates were however arrived at by including all non-Jewish family members and household members, rather than surveyed individuals. In a 2019 study by Jews of Color Initiative it was found that approximately 12-15% of Jews in the United States, about 1,000,000 of 7,200,000 identify as multiracial and Jews of color.

The overall population of Americans of Jewish descent is demographically characterized by an aging population composition and low fertility rates significantly below generational replacement. However, the Orthodox Jewish population, concentrated in the Northeastern United States, has fertility rates when taken alone which are significantly higher than both generational replacement and that of the average U.S. population.

The National Jewish Population Survey of 1990 asked 4.5 million adult Jews to identify their denomination. The national total showed 38% were affiliated with the Reform tradition, 35% were Conservative, 6% were Orthodox, 1% were Reconstructionists, 10% linked themselves to some other tradition, and 10% said they are &quot;just Jewish.&quot; In 2013, Pew Research&#x27;s Jewish population survey found that 35% of American Jews identified as Reform, 18% as Conservative, 10% as Orthodox, 6% who identified with other sects, and 30% did not identify with a denomination. Pew&#x27;s 2020 poll found that 37% affiliated with Reform Judaism, 17% with Conservative Judaism, and 9% with Orthodox Judaism. Young Jews are more likely to identify as Orthodox or as unaffiliated compared to older members of the Jewish community.

Many Jews are concentrated in the Northeastern United States, particularly around New York City. The world&#x27;s largest menorah is lit annually at Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan, while the largest menorah in New Jersey is similarly celebrated in Monroe Township, Middlesex County. Many Jews also live in South Florida, Los Angeles, and other large metropolitan areas, like Chicago, San Francisco, or Atlanta. The metropolitan areas of New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami contain nearly one quarter of the world&#x27;s Jews and the New York City metropolitan area itself contains around a quarter of all Jews living in the United States.

===By state===
According to a study published by demographers and sociologists Ira M. Sheskin and Arnold Dashefsky in the American Jewish Yearbook, the distribution of the Jewish population in 2024 was as follows:

===Significant Jewish population centers===


The New York City metropolitan area is the second-largest Jewish population center in the world after the Tel Aviv metropolitan area in Israel. Several other major cities have large Jewish communities, including Los Angeles, Miami, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia. In many metropolitan areas, the majority of Jewish families live in suburban areas. The Greater Phoenix area was home to about 83,000 Jews in 2002, and has been rapidly growing. The greatest Jewish population on a per-capita basis for incorporated areas in the US are Kiryas Joel Village, New York (greater than 93% based on language spoken in home), City of Beverly Hills, California (61%), and Lakewood Township, New Jersey (59%), with two of the incorporated areas, Kiryas Joel and Lakewood, having a high concentration of Haredi Jews, and one incorporated area, Beverly Hills, having a high concentration of non-Orthodox Jews.

The phenomenon of Israeli migration to the US is often termed &quot;Yerida&quot;. The Israeli immigrant community in America is less widespread. The significant Israeli immigrant communities in the United States are in the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago.
* The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculated an &#x27;expatriate rate&#x27; of 2.9 persons per thousand, putting Israel in the mid-range of expatriate rates among the 175 OECD countries examined in 2005.

According to the 2001 undertaking of the National Jewish Population Survey, 4.3 million American Jews have some sort of strong connection to the Jewish community, whether religious or cultural.

===Distribution of Jewish Americans===
According to the North American Jewish Data Bank the 104 counties and independent cities with the largest Jewish communities, as a percentage of population, were:


===Assimilation and population changes===
These parallel themes have facilitated the extraordinary economic, political, and social success of the American Jewish community, but also have contributed to widespread cultural assimilation. More recently however, the propriety and degree of assimilation has also become a significant and controversial issue within the modern American Jewish community, with both political and religious skeptics.

While not all Jews disapprove of intermarriage, many members of the Jewish community have become concerned that the high rate of interfaith marriage will result in the eventual disappearance of the American Jewish community. Intermarriage rates have risen from roughly 6% in 1950 and 25% in 1974, to approximately 40–50% in the year 2000. By 2013, the intermarriage rate had risen to 71% for non-Orthodox Jews. This, in combination with the comparatively low birthrate in the Jewish community, has led to a 5% decline in the Jewish population of the United States in the 1990s. In addition to this, when compared with the general American population, the American Jewish community is slightly older.

A third of intermarried couples provide their children with a Jewish upbringing, and doing so is more common among intermarried families raising their children in areas with high Jewish populations. The Boston area, for example, is exceptional in that an estimated 60% of children of intermarriages are being raised Jewish, meaning that intermarriage would actually be contributing to a net &quot;increase&quot; in the number of Jews. As well, some children raised through intermarriage rediscover and embrace their Jewish roots when they themselves marry and have children.

In contrast to the ongoing trends of assimilation, some communities within American Jewry, such as Orthodox Jews, have significantly higher birth rates and lower intermarriage rates, and are growing rapidly. The proportion of Jewish synagogue members who were Orthodox rose from 11% in 1971 to 21% in 2000, while the overall Jewish community declined in number.  In 2000, there were 360,000 so-called &quot;ultra-orthodox&quot; (Haredi) Jews in USA (7.2%). The figure for 2006 is estimated at 468,000 (9.4%). Data from the Pew Center shows that, as of 2013, 27% of American Jews under the age of 18 live in Orthodox households, a dramatic increase from Jews aged 18 to 29, only 11% of whom are Orthodox. The UJA-Federation of New York reports that 60% of Jewish children in the New York City area live in Orthodox homes. In addition to economizing and sharing, many Haredi communities depend on government aid to support their high birth rate and large families. The Hasidic village of New Square, New York receives Section8 housing subsidies at a higher rate than the rest of the region, and half of the population in the Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel, New York receive food stamps, while a third receive Medicaid.

About half of the American Jews are considered to be religious. Out of this 2,831,000 religious Jewish population, 92% are non-Hispanic white, 5% Hispanic (Most commonly from Argentina, Venezuela, or Cuba), 1% Asian, 1% black and 1% Other (mixed-race etc.). Almost this many non-religious Jews exist in the United States.

===Race and ethnicity===
The United States Census Bureau classifies most American Jews as white. Jewish people are culturally diverse and may be of any race, ethnicity, or national origin. Many Jews have culturally assimilated into and are phenotypically indistinguishable from the dominant local populations of regions like Europe, the Caucasus and the Crimea, North Africa, West Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, South, East, and Central Asia, and the Americas where they have lived for many centuries. Most American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews who descend from Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and are considered white unless they are Ashkenazi Jews of color. Many American Jews identify themselves as being both Jewish and white, while many solely identify as Jewish, resisting this identification. Several commentators have observed that &quot;many American Jews retain a feeling of ambivalence about whiteness&quot;. Karen Brodkin explains this ambivalence as rooted in anxieties about the potential loss of Jewish identity, especially outside of intellectual elites. Similarly, Kenneth Marcus observes a number of ambivalent cultural phenomena which have also been noted by other scholars, and he concludes that &quot;the veneer of whiteness has not established conclusively the racial construction of American Jews&quot;. The relationship between Jewish identity and white majority identity continues to be described as &quot;complicated&quot; for many American Jews, particularly Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews of European descent. The issue of Jewish whiteness may be different for many Mizrahi, Sephardi, Black, Asian, and Latino Jews, many of whom may never be considered white by society. Many American white nationalists and white supremacists view all Jews as non-white, even if they are of European descent. Some white nationalists believe that Jews can be white and a small number of white nationalists are Jewish.

In 2013, the Pew Research Center&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Jewish Americans&quot; found that more than 90% of Jews who responded to its survey described themselves as being non-Hispanic whites, 2% described themselves as being black, 3% described themselves as being Hispanic, and 2% described themselves as having other racial or ethnic backgrounds.

====Jews by race, ancestry, or national origin====

=====Asian American Jews=====
According to the Pew Research Center, fewer than 1% of American Jews in 2020 identified as Asian Americans. Around 1% of religious Jews identified as Asian American.

A small but growing community of around 350 Indian American Jews lives in the New York City metropolitan area, in both New York state and New Jersey. Many are members of India&#x27;s Bene Israel community. The Indian Jewish Congregation of USA, headquartered in New York City, is the center of the organized community.

=====Jews of European descent=====
Jews of European descent, often referred to as white Jews, are classified as white by the US census and have generally been classified as legally white throughout American history. Many American Jews of European descent identify themselves as being both Jewish and white, while others solely identify themselves as being Jewish or identify as both Jewish and non-white. However, Jews of European descent rarely identify as Jews of color and are rarely considered people of color in American society. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of American Jews are non-Hispanic white Ashkenazi Jews. Law professor David Bernstein has questioned the idea that American Jews were once considered non-white, writing that American Jews were &quot;indeed considered white by law and by custom&quot; despite the fact that they experienced &quot;discrimination, hostility, assertions of inferiority and occasionally even violence.&quot; Bernstein notes that Jews were not targeted by laws against interracial marriage, were allowed to attend whites-only schools, and were classified as white in the Jim Crow South. The sociologists Philip Q. Yang and Kavitha Koshy have also questioned what they call the &quot;becoming white thesis&quot;, noting that most Jews of European descent have been legally classified as white since the first US census in 1790, were legally white for the purposes of the Naturalization Act of 1790 that limited citizenship to &quot;free White person(s)&quot;, and that they could find no legislative or judicial evidence that American Jews had ever been considered non-white.

Several commentators have observed that &quot;many American Jews retain a feeling of ambivalence about whiteness&quot;. Karen Brodkin explains this ambivalence as rooted in anxieties about the potential loss of Jewish identity, especially outside of intellectual elites. Similarly, Kenneth Marcus observes a number of ambivalent cultural phenomena which have also been noted by other scholars, and he concludes that &quot;the veneer of whiteness has not established conclusively the racial construction of American Jews&quot;. The relationship between American Jews and white majority identity continues to be described as &quot;complicated&quot;. Many American white nationalists view Jews as non-white.

=====Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent=====
Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent (often referred to as Mizrahi Jews) are classified as white by the US census. Mizrahi Jews sometimes identify as Jews of color, but often do not, and they may or may not be considered people of color by society. Syrian Jews rarely identify as Jews of color and are generally not considered Jews of color by society. Many Syrian Jews identify as white, Middle Eastern, or otherwise non-white rather than as Jews of color.

=====African American Jews=====


The American Jewish community includes African American Jews and other American Jews who are of African descent, a definition which excludes North African Jewish Americans, who are currently classified by the US census as being white (although a new category was recommended by the Census Bureau for the 2020 census). Estimates of the number of American Jews of African descent in the United States range from 20,000 to 200,000. Jews of African descent belong to all American Jewish denominations. Like their other Jewish counterparts, some black Jews are atheists.

Notable African American Jews include Drake, Lenny Kravitz, Lisa Bonet, Sammy Davis Jr., Rashida Jones, Ros Gold-Onwude, Yaphet Kotto, Jordan Farmar, Taylor Mays, Daveed Diggs, Alicia Garza, Tiffany Haddish, and rabbis Capers Funnye and Alysa Stanton.

Relations between American Jews of African descent and other Jewish Americans are generally cordial. There are, however, disagreements with a specific minority of Black Hebrew Israelites community from among African Americans who consider themselves, but not other Jews, to be the true descendants of the ancient Israelites. Black Hebrew Israelites are generally not considered members of the mainstream Jewish community, because they have not formally converted to Judaism, and they are not ethnically related to other Jews. One such group, the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, emigrated to Israel and was granted permanent residency status there.

=====Hispanic and Latin American Jews=====
Hispanic Jews have lived in what is now the United States since colonial times. The earliest Hispanic Jewish settlers were Sephardi Jews from Spain and Portugal. Beginning in the 1500s, some of the Spanish settlers in what is now New Mexico and Texas were Crypto-Jews, but there was no organized Jewish presence. Later waves of Sephardi immigration brought Judeo-Spanish speaking Jews from the Ottoman Empire, in what is now Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Libya, and Syria. These Spanish-speaking Sephardi Jews, as well as Sephardi Jews of European descent, such as the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, are sometimes considered culturally but not ethnically Hispanic.

Hispanic and Latin American Jews, particularly Hispanic and Latin American Ashkenazi Jews, often identify as white rather than as Jews of color. Some Jews with roots in Latin America may not identify as &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot; at all, usually due to their recent European immigrant origins. American Jews of Argentine, Brazilian, and Mexican descent are often Ashkenazi, but some are Sephardi.

====Jews divided by cultural or Jewish ethnic division groupings====
=====Ashkenazi Jews in the United States=====
Ashkenazi Jews, also known as Ashkenazic Jews or, by using the Hebrew plural suffix &quot;-im,&quot; Ashkenazim are a Jewish diaspora population who coalesced in the Holy Roman Empire around the end of the first millennium. The term &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; refers to Jewish settlers who established communities along the Rhine river in Western Germany and in Northern France dating to the Middle Ages. The traditional diaspora language of Ashkenazi Jews is Yiddish (a Germanic language with elements of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Slavic languages), developed after they had moved into northern Europe: beginning with Germany and France in the Middle Ages. For centuries they used Hebrew only as a sacred language, until the revival of Hebrew as a common language in 20th century&#x27;s Israel. A majority of the Jewish population in the United States are Ashkenazi Jews who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe. Most American Ashkenazi Jews are non-Hispanic whites, but a minority are Jews of color, Hispanic/Latino, or both.

=====Sephardi Jews in the United States=====
Sephardi Jews, also known as Sephardic Jews, Sephardim, or Hispanic Jews by modern scholars, are a Jewish ethnic division originating from traditionally established communities in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). The term &quot;Sephardim&quot; also sometimes refers to Mizrahi Jews (Eastern Jewish communities) of Western Asia and North Africa. Although most of this latter group do not have ancestry from the Jewish communities of Iberia, the majority of them were influenced by the Sephardic style of liturgy and Sephardic law and customs from the influence of the Iberian Jewish exiles over the course of the last few centuries (including from the Sephardic Golden Age and the teachings of many Iberian Jewish philosophers). This article deals with Sephardim within the narrower ethnic definition.

Largely expelled from the Iberian Peninsula in the late 15th century, they carried a distinctive Jewish diasporic identity with them to North Africa, including modern day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt; South-Eastern and Southern Europe, including France, Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia; Western Asia, including Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran; as well as the Americas (although in smaller numbers compared to the Ashkenazi Jewish diaspora); and all other places of their exiled settlement. They sometimes settled near existing Jewish communities, such as the one from former Kurdistan, or were the first in new frontiers, with their furthest reach via the Silk Road.

As a result of the more recent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, many of the Sephardim Tehorim from Western Asia and North Africa relocated to either Israel or France, where they form a significant portion of the Jewish communities today. Other significant communities of Sephardim Tehorim also migrated in more recent times from the Near East to New York City, Argentina, Costa Rica, Mexico, Montreal, Gibraltar, Puerto Rico, and Dominican Republic. Because of poverty and turmoil in Latin America, another wave of Sephardic Jews joined other Latin Americans who migrated to the United States, Canada, Spain, and other countries of Europe.

=====Mizrahi Jews in the United States=====
Mizrahi Jews () or Mizrahim (), also sometimes referred to as Mizrachi (), Edot HaMizrach (; ) or Oriental Jews, are the descendants of the local Jewish communities that had existed in Asia and North Africa from Biblical times into the modern era.

The term &quot;Mizrahim&quot; is almost exclusively applied to descendants of the Middle Eastern Jewish communities from Asia and North Africa; in this classification are Iraqi, Kurdish, Lebanese, Syrian, Yemenite, Turkish, Iranian Jews, Bukharian Jews and Mountain Jews, as well as the descendants of Maghrebi Jews who had lived in North African countries, such as Egyptian, Libyan, Tunisian, Algerian, and Moroccan Jews.

Post-1948, Mizrahi Jewish, mostly thousands from Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jewish descent, as well as some from other Middle East and North African Jewish communities migrated to the United States.

=====Ethiopian Jews in the United States=====
The Beta Israel, also known as Ethiopian Jews, are a Jewish community that developed and lived for centuries in the area of the Ethiopian Empire. Most of the Beta Israel community emigrated to Israel in the late 20th century. Since the 1990s, around 1000 Hebrew-speaking, Ethiopian Jews that had settled in Israel as Ethiopian Jews in Israel re-settled in the United States as Ethiopian Americans, with around half of the Ethiopian Jewish Israeli-American community living in New York.

===Socioeconomics===
Education plays a major role as a part of Jewish identity. As Jewish culture puts a special premium on it and stresses the importance of cultivation of intellectual pursuits, scholarship, and learning, American Jews as a group tend to be better educated and earn more than Americans as a whole. Jewish Americans also have an average of 14.7 years of schooling making them the most highly educated of all major religious groups in the United States.

Forty-four percent (55% of Reform Jews) report family incomes of over $100,000 compared to 19% of all Americans, with the next highest group being Hindus at 43%. And while 27% of Americans have a four-year university or postgraduate education, fifty-nine percent (66% of Reform Jews) of American Jews have, the second highest of any ethnic groups after Indian-Americans. 75% of American Jews have achieved some form of post-secondary education if two-year vocational and community college diplomas and certificates are also included.

31% of American Jews hold a graduate degree; this figure is compared with the general American population where 11% of Americans hold a graduate degree. White collar professional jobs have been attractive to Jews and much of the community tend to take up professional white collar careers requiring tertiary education involving formal credentials where the respectability and reputability of professional jobs is highly prized within Jewish culture. While 46% of Americans work in professional and managerial jobs, 61% of American Jews work as professionals, many of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed in management, professional, and related occupations such as engineering, science, medicine, investment banking, finance, law, and academia.

Much of the Jewish American community lead middle class lifestyles. While the median household net worth of the typical American family is $99,500, among American Jews the figure is $443,000. In addition, the median Jewish American income is estimated to be in the range of $97,000 to $98,000, nearly twice as high the American national median. Either of these two statistics may be confounded by the fact that the Jewish population is on average older than other religious groups in the country, with 51% of polled adults over the age of 50 compared to 41% nationally. Older people tend to both have higher income and be more highly educated. By 2016, Modern Orthodox Jews had a median household income of $158,000, while Open Orthodox Jews had a median household income at $185,000 (compared to the American median household income of $59,000 for 2016).

As a whole, American and Canadian Jews donate more than $9billion a year to charity. This reflects Jewish traditions of supporting social services as a way of living out the dictates of Jewish law. Most of the charities that benefit are not specifically Jewish organizations.

While the median income of Jewish Americans is high, some Jewish communities have high levels of poverty. In the New York area, there are approximately 560,000 Jews living in poor or near-poor households, representing about 20% of the New York metropolitan Jewish community. Jewish people affected by poverty are disproportionately likely to be children, young adults, the elderly, people with low educational attainment, part-time workers, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, immigrants without American citizenship, Holocaust survivors, Orthodox families, and single adults including single parents. Disability is a major factor in the socioeconomic status of disabled Jews. Disabled Jews are significantly more likely to be low-income compared to able-bodied Jews, while high-income Jews are significantly less likely to be disabled. Secular Jews, Jews of no denomination, and people who identify as &quot;just Jewish&quot; are also more likely to live in poverty compared to Jews affiliated with a religious denomination.

According to analysis by Gallup, American Jews have the highest well-being of any ethnic or religious group in America.

The great majority of school-age Jewish students attend public schools, although Jewish day schools and yeshivas are to be found throughout the country. Jewish cultural studies and Hebrew language instruction is also commonly offered at synagogues in the form of supplementary Hebrew schools or Sunday schools.

From the early 1900s until the 1950s, quota systems were imposed at elite colleges and universities particularly in the Northeast, as a response to the growing number of children of recent Jewish immigrants; these limited the number of Jewish students accepted, and greatly reduced their previous attendance. Jewish enrollment at Cornell&#x27;s School of Medicine fell from 40% to 4% between the world wars, and Harvard&#x27;s fell from 30% to 4%. Before 1945, only a few Jewish professors were permitted as instructors at elite universities. In 1941, for example, antisemitism drove Milton Friedman from a non-tenured assistant professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Harry Levin became the first Jewish full professor in the Harvard English department in 1943, but the Economics department decided not to hire Paul Samuelson in 1948. Harvard hired its first Jewish biochemists in 1954.

According to Clark Kerr, Martin Meyerson in 1965 became the first Jew to serve, albeit temporarily, as the leader of a major American research university. That year, Meyerson served as acting chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, but was unable to obtain a permanent appointment as a result of a combination of tactical errors on his part and antisemitism on the UC Board of Regents. Meyerson served as the president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1970 to 1981.

By 1986, a third of the presidents of the elite undergraduate final clubs at Harvard were Jewish. Rick Levin was president of Yale University from 1993 to 2013, Judith Rodin was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1994 to 2004 (and is currently president of the Rockefeller Foundation), Paul Samuelson&#x27;s nephew, Lawrence Summers, was president of Harvard University from 2001 until 2006, and Harold Shapiro was president of Princeton University from 1992 until 2000.

====American Jews at American higher education institutions====
==Religion==
===Observances and engagement===
The American Jews&#x27; majority continues to identify themselves with Judaism and its main traditions, such as Conservative, Orthodox and Reform Judaism. But, already in the 1980s, 20–30 percent of members of largest Jewish communities, such as of New York City, Chicago, Miami, and others, rejected a denominational label.
According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, 38% of Jews were affiliated with the Reform tradition, 35% were Conservative, 6% were Orthodox, 1% were Reconstructionists, 10% linked themselves to some other tradition, and 10% said they are &quot;just Jewish&quot;.

Jewish religious practice in America is quite varied. Among the 4.3 million American Jews described as &quot;strongly connected&quot; to Judaism, over 80% report some sort of active engagement with Judaism, ranging from attending at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum, to as little as attending only Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on the other.

A 2003 Harris Poll found that 16% of American Jews go to the synagogue at least once a month, 42% go less frequently but at least once a year, and 42% go less frequently than once a year.
The survey found that of the 4.3 million strongly connected Jews, 46% belong to a synagogue. Among those households who belong to a synagogue, 38% are members of Reform synagogues, 33% Conservative, 22% Orthodox, 2% Reconstructionist, and 5% other types.

Traditionally, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews do not have different branches (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) but usually remain observant and religious. However, their synagogues are generally considered Orthodox or Sephardic Haredim by non-Sephardic Jews. But, not all Sephardim are Orthodox; among the pioneers of Reform Judaism movement in the 1820s there was the Sephardic congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina.

The survey discovered that Jews in the Northeast and Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West. Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups, Jews in the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant.

The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that around 3.4 million American Jews call themselves religious—out of a general Jewish population of about 5.4 million. The number of Jews who identify themselves as only culturally Jewish has risen from 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, according to the study. In the same period, the number of all US adults who said they had no religion rose from 8% to 15%. Jews are more likely to be secular than Americans in general, the researchers said. About half of all US Jews—including those who consider themselves religiously observant—claim in the survey that they have a secular worldview and see no contradiction between that outlook and their faith, according to the study&#x27;s authors. Researchers attribute the trends among American Jews to the high rate of intermarriage and &quot;disaffection from Judaism&quot; in the United States.

===Religious beliefs===
American Jews are more likely to be atheists or agnostics than most Americans, especially when they are compared with American Protestants or Catholics. A 2003 poll found that while 79% of Americans believe in God, only 48% of American Jews do, compared to 79% and 90% of American Catholics and Protestants respectively. While 66% of Americans said that they were &quot;absolutely certain&quot; of God&#x27;s existence, 24% of American Jews said the same. And though 9% of Americans believe that there is no God (8% of American Catholics and 4% of American Protestants), 19% of American Jews believe that God does not exist.

A 2009 Harris Poll showed that American Jews constitute the one religious group which is most accepting of the science of evolution, with 80% accepting evolution, compared to 51% for Catholics, 32% for Protestants, and 16% of born-again Christians. They were also less likely to believe in supernatural phenomena such as miracles, angels, or heaven.

A 2013 Pew Research Center report found that 1.7 million American Jewish adults, 1.6 million of whom were raised in Jewish homes or had Jewish ancestry, identified as Christians or Messianic Jews but also consider themselves ethnically Jewish. Another 700,000 American Christian adults considered themselves &quot;Jews by affinity&quot; or &quot;grafted-in&quot; Jews.

====Buddhism====
Jewish Buddhists are overrepresented among American Buddhists; this is specifically the case among those Jews whose parents are not Buddhist, and those Jews who are without a Buddhist heritage, with between one fifth and 30% of all American Buddhists identifying as Jewish though only 2% of Americans are Jewish. Nicknamed &quot;Jubu&quot;s, an increasing number of American Jews have started to adopt Buddhist spiritual practices, while at the same time, they are continuing to identify with and practice Judaism. It may be the individual practices both Judaism and Buddhism. Notable American Jewish Buddhists include: Robert Downey Jr. Allen Ginsberg, Linda Pritzker, Jonathan F.P. Rose, Goldie Hawn and daughter Kate Hudson, Steven Seagal, Adam Yauch of the rap group The Beastie Boys, and Garry Shandling. Film makers the Coen Brothers have been influenced by Buddhism as well for a time.

==Contemporary politics==

Today, American Jews are a distinctive and influential group in the nation&#x27;s politics. Jeffrey S. Helmreich writes that the ability of American Jews to effect this through political or financial clout is overestimated, that the primary influence lies in the group&#x27;s voting patterns.

&quot;Jews have devoted themselves to politics with almost religious fervor,&quot; writes Mitchell Bard, who adds that Jews have the highest percentage voter turnout of any ethnic group (84% reported being registered to vote).

Though the majority (60–70%) of the country&#x27;s Jews identify as Democratic, Jews span the political spectrum, with those at higher levels of observance being far more likely to vote Republican than their less observant and secular counterparts.
Owing to high Democratic identification in the 2008 United States Presidential Election, 78% of Jews voted for Democrat Barack Obama versus 21% for Republican John McCain, despite Republican attempts to connect Obama to Muslim and pro-Palestinian causes. It has been suggested that running mate Sarah Palin&#x27;s conservative views on social issues may have nudged Jews away from the McCain–Palin ticket. In the 2012 United States presidential election, 69% of Jews voted for the Democratic incumbent President Obama.

In 2019, after the 2016 election of Donald Trump, poll data from the Jewish Electorate Institute showed that 73% of Jewish voters felt less secure as Jews than before, 71% disapproved of Trump&#x27;s handling of anti-Semitism (54% strongly disapprove), 59% felt that he bears &quot;at least some responsibility&quot; for the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and Poway synagogue shooting, and 38% were concerned that Trump was encouraging right-wing extremism. Views of the Democratic and Republican parties were milder: 28% were concerned that Republicans were making alliances with white nationalists and tolerating anti-Semitism within their ranks, while 27% were concerned that Democrats were tolerating anti-Semitism within their ranks.

In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, 77% of American Jews voted for Joe Biden, while 22% voted for Donald Trump.

===Foreign policy===
American Jews have displayed a very strong interest in foreign affairs, especially regarding Germany in the 1930s, and Israel since 1945. Both major parties have made strong commitments in support of Israel. Dr. Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland argues, with regard to the 2004 election: &quot;Only 15% of Jews said that Israel was a key voting issue. Among those voters, 55% voted for Kerry (compared to 83% of Jewish voters not concerned with Israel).&quot; Uslander goes on to point out that negative views of Evangelical Christians had a distinctly negative impact for Republicans among Jewish voters, while Orthodox Jews, traditionally more conservative in outlook as to social issues, favored the Republican Party. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article suggests that the Jewish movement to the Republican party is focused heavily on faith-based issues, similar to the Catholic vote, which is credited for helping President Bush taking Florida in 2004. However, Natan Guttman, &quot;The Forward&quot;″s Washington bureau chief, dismisses this notion, writing in &quot;Moment&quot; that while &quot;[i]t is true that Republicans are making small and steady strides into the Jewish community... a look at the past three decades of exit polls, which are more reliable than pre-election polls, and the numbers are clear: Jews vote overwhelmingly Democratic,&quot; an assertion confirmed by the most recent presidential election results.

Jewish Americans were more strongly opposed to the Iraq War from its onset than any other ethnic group, or even most Americans. The greater opposition to the war was not simply a result of high Democratic identification among Jewish Americans, as Jewish Americans of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.

===Domestic issues===
A 2013 Pew Research Center survey suggests that American Jews&#x27; views on domestic politics are intertwined with the community&#x27;s self-definition as a persecuted minority who benefited from the liberties and societal shifts in the United States and feel obligated to help other minorities enjoy the same benefits. American Jews across age and gender lines tend to vote for and support politicians and policies which are supported by the Democratic Party. On the other hand, Orthodox American Jews have domestic political views which are more similar to those of their religious Christian neighbors.

American Jews are largely supportive of LGBT rights with 79% responding in a 2011 Pew poll that homosexuality should be &quot;accepted by society&quot;, while the overall average in the same 2011 poll among Americans of all demographic groups was that 50%. A split on homosexuality exists by level of observance. Reform rabbis in America perform same-sex marriages as a matter of routine, and there are fifteen LGBT Jewish congregations in North America. Reform, Reconstructionist and, increasingly, Conservative, Jews are far more supportive on issues like gay marriage than Orthodox Jews are. A 2007 survey of Conservative Jewish leaders and activists showed that an overwhelming majority supported gay rabbinical ordination and same-sex marriage. Accordingly, 78% of Jewish voters rejected Prop8, the bill that banned gay marriage in California. No other ethnic or religious group voted as strongly against it.

A 2014 Pew poll found that American Jews mostly support abortion rights, with 83% answering that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

In considering the trade-off between the economy and environmental protection, American Jews were significantly more likely than other religious groups (excepting Buddhism) to favor stronger environmental protection.

Jews in America also overwhelmingly oppose current United States marijuana policy. In 2009, eighty-six percent of Jewish Americans opposed arresting nonviolent marijuana smokers, compared to 61% for the population at large and 68% of all Democrats. Additionally, 85% of Jews in the United States opposed using federal law enforcement to close patient cooperatives for medical marijuana in states where medical marijuana is legal, compared to 67% of the population at large and 73% of Democrats.

A 2014 Pew Research survey titled &quot;How Americans Feel About Religious Groups&quot;, found that Jews were viewed the most favorably of all other groups, with a rating of 63 out of 100. Jews were viewed most positively by fellow Jews, followed by white Evangelicals. Sixty percent of the 3,200 persons surveyed said they had ever met a Jew.

==Jewish American culture==
Since the time of the last major wave of Jewish immigration to America (over 2,000,000 Jews from Eastern Europe who arrived between 1890 and 1924), Jewish secular culture in the United States has become integrated in almost every important way with the broader American culture. Many aspects of Jewish American culture have, in turn, become part of the wider culture of the United States.

===Language===
Most American Jews today are native English speakers. A variety of other languages are still spoken within some American Jewish communities that are representative of the various Jewish ethnic divisions from around the world that have come together to make up all of America&#x27;s Jewish population.

Many of America&#x27;s Hasidic Jews, being exclusively of Ashkenazi descent, are raised speaking Yiddish. Yiddish was once spoken as the primary language by most of the several million Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to the United States. It was, in fact, the original language in which &quot;The Forward&quot; was published. Yiddish has had an influence on American English, and words borrowed from it include &quot;chutzpah&quot; (&quot;effrontery&quot;, &quot;gall&quot;), &quot;nosh&quot; (&quot;snack&quot;), &quot;schlep&quot; (&quot;drag&quot;), &quot;schmuck&quot; (&quot;an obnoxious, contemptible person&quot;, euphemism for &quot;penis&quot;), and, depending on idiolect, hundreds of other terms. (See also Yinglish.)

Many Mizrahi Jews, including those from Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Morocco, Libya, etc. speak Arabic. There are communities of Mizrahim in Brooklyn. The town of Deal, New Jersey, is notably mostly Syrian-Jewish, with many of them Orthodox.

The Persian Jewish community in the United States, notably the large community in and around Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California, primarily speak Persian (see also Judeo-Persian) in the home and synagogue. They also support their own Persian language newspapers. Persian Jews also reside in eastern parts of New York such as Kew Gardens and Great Neck, Long Island.

Many recent Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union speak primarily Russian at home, and there are several notable communities where public life and business are carried out mainly in Russian, such as in Brighton Beach in New York City and Sunny Isles Beach in Florida. 2010 estimates of the number of Jewish Russian-speaking households in the New York city area are around 92,000, and the number of individuals are somewhere between 223,000 and 350,000. Another high population of Russian Jews can be found in the Richmond District of San Francisco where Russian markets stand alongside the numerous Asian businesses.

American Bukharan Jews speak Bukhori, a dialect of Tajik Persian. They publish their own newspapers such as the &quot;Bukharian Times&quot; and a large portion live in Queens, New York. Forest Hills in the New York City borough of Queens is home to 108th Street, which is called by some &quot;Bukharian Broadway&quot;, a reference to the many stores and restaurants found on and around the street that have Bukharian influences. Many Bukharians are also represented in parts of Arizona, Miami, Florida, and areas of Southern California such as San Diego.

There is a sizeable Mountain Jewish population in Brooklyn, New York that speaks Judeo-Tat (Juhuri), a dialect of Persian.

Classical Hebrew is the language of most Jewish religious literature, such as the Tanakh (Bible) and Siddur (prayerbook). Modern Hebrew is also the primary official language of the modern State of Israel, which further encourages many to learn it as a second language. Some recent Israeli immigrants to America speak Hebrew as their primary language.

There are a diversity of Hispanic Jews living in America. The oldest community is that of the Sephardi Jews of New Netherland. Their ancestors had fled Spain or Portugal during the Inquisition for the Netherlands, and then came to New Netherland. Though there is dispute over whether they should be considered Hispanic. Some Hispanic Jews, particularly in Miami and Los Angeles, immigrated from Latin America. The largest groups are those that fled Cuba after the communist revolution (known as Jewbans), Argentine Jews, and more recently, Venezuelan Jews. Argentina is the Latin American country with the largest Jewish population. There are a large number of synagogues in the Miami area that give services in Spanish. The last Hispanic Jewish community would be those that recently came from Portugal or Spain, after Spain and Portugal granted citizenship to the descendants of Jews who fled during the Inquisition. All the above listed Hispanic Jewish groups speak either Spanish or Ladino.

===Jewish American literature===
Although American Jews have contributed greatly to American arts in general, there still remains a distinctly Jewish American literature. Jewish American literature often explores the experience of being a Jew in America, and the conflicting pulls of secular society and history.

===Popular culture===
Yiddish theater was very well attended, and provided a training ground for performers and producers who moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. Many of the early Hollywood moguls and pioneers were Jewish. They played roles in the development of radio and television networks, typified by William S. Paley who ran CBS. Stephen J. Whitfield states that &quot;The Sarnoff family was long dominant at NBC.&quot;

Many individual Jews have made significant contributions to American popular culture. There have been many Jewish American actors and performers, ranging from early 1900s actors, to classic Hollywood film stars, and culminating in many currently known actors. The field of American comedy includes many Jews. The legacy also includes songwriters and authors, for example the author of the song &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; Doc Pomus, or &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; composer Aaron Copland. Many Jews have been at the forefront of women&#x27;s issues.

=== Sports ===
The first generation of Jewish Americans who immigrated during the 1880–1924 peak period were not interested in baseball, the country&#x27;s national pastime, and in some cases tried to prevent their children from watching or participating in baseball-related activities. Most were focused on making sure they and their children took advantage of education and employment opportunities. Despite the efforts of parents, Jewish children became interested in baseball quickly since it was already embedded in the broader American culture. The second generation of immigrants saw baseball as a means to celebrate American culture without abandoning their broader religious community. After 1924, many Yiddish newspapers began covering baseball, which they had not done previously.

===Government and military===


Since 1845, a total of 34 Jews have served in the Senate, including the 14 present-day senators noted above. Judah P. Benjamin was the first practicing Jewish Senator, and would later serve as Confederate Secretary of War and Secretary of State during the Civil War. Rahm Emanuel served as Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama. The number of Jews elected to the House rose to an all-time high of 30. Eight Jews have been appointed to the United States Supreme Court, of which one (Elena Kagan) is currently serving. Had Merrick Garland&#x27;s 2016 nomination been accepted, that number would have risen to four out of nine since Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer were also serving at that time.

The Civil War marked a transition for American Jews. It killed off the antisemitic canard, widespread in Europe, to the effect that Jews are cowardly, preferring to run from war rather than serve alongside their fellow citizens in battle.

At least twenty eight American Jews have been awarded the Medal of Honor.

===World War II===
More than 550,000 Jews served in the U.S. military during World War II; about 11,000 of them were killed and more than 40,000 of them were wounded. There were three recipients of the Medal of Honor; 157 recipients of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Service Cross, or Navy Cross; and about 1600 recipients of the Silver Star. About 50,000 other decorations and awards were given to Jewish military personnel, making a total of 52,000 decorations. During this period, Jews were approximately 3.3 percent of the total U.S. population but they constituted about 4.23 percent of the U.S. armed forces. About 60 percent of all Jewish physicians in the United States who were under 45 years of age were in service as military physicians and medics.

Many Jewish physicists, including J. Robert Oppenheimer, were involved in the Manhattan Project, the secret World War II effort to develop the atomic bomb. Many of these physicists were refugees from Nazi Germany or they were refugees from antisemitic persecution which was also occurring elsewhere in Europe.

===American folk music===
Jews have been involved in the American folk music scene since the late 19th century; these tended to be refugees from Central and Eastern Europe, and significantly more economically disadvantaged than their established Western European Sephardic coreligionists. Historians see it as a legacy of the secular Yiddish theater, cantorial traditions and a desire to assimilate. By the 1940s Jews had become established in the American folk music scene.

Examples of the major impact Jews have had in the American folk music arena include, but are not limited to: Moe Asch the first to record and release much of the music of Woody Guthrie, including &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; (see The Asch Recordings) in response to Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot;, and Guthrie wrote Jewish songs. Guthrie married a Jew and their son Arlo became influential in his own right. Asch&#x27;s one-man corporation Folkways Records also released much of the music of Leadbelly and Pete Seeger from the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s. Asch&#x27;s large music catalog was voluntarily donated to the Smithsonian.

Jews have also thrived in Jazz music and contributed to its popularization.

Three of the four creators of the Newport Folk Festival, Wein, Bikel and Grossman (Seeger is not) were Jewish. Albert Grossman put together Peter, Paul and Mary, of which Yarrow is Jewish. Oscar Brand, from a Canadian Jewish family, has the longest running radio program &quot;Oscar Brand&#x27;s Folksong Festival&quot; which has been on air consecutively since 1945 from New York City. And is the first American broadcast where the host himself will answer any personal correspondence.

The influential group The Weavers, successor to the Almanac Singers, led by Pete Seeger, had a Jewish manager, and two of the four members of the group were Jewish (Gilbert and Hellerman). The B-side of &quot;Good Night Irene&quot; had the Hebrew folk song personally chosen for the record by Pete Seeger &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;.

The influential folk music magazine &quot;Sing Out!&quot; was co-founded and edited by Irwin Silber in 1951, and edited by him until 1967, when the magazine stopped publication for decades. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s first music critic Jon Landau is of German Jewish descent. Izzy Young who created the legendary Folklore Center in New York, and currently the Folklore Centrum near Mariatorget in Södermalm, Sweden, which relates to American and Swedish folk music.

Dave Van Ronk observed that the behind the scenes 1950s folk scene &quot;was at the very least 50 percent Jewish, and they adopted the music as part of their assimilation into the Anglo-American tradition which itself was largely an artificial construct but none the less provided us with some common ground&quot;.
Nobel Prize winner Bob Dylan is also Jewish.

===Finance and law===
Jews have been involved in financial services since the colonial era. They received rights to trade fur, from the Dutch and Swedish colonies. British governors honored these rights after taking over. During the Revolutionary War, Haym Solomon helped create America&#x27;s first semi-central bank, and advised Alexander Hamilton on the building of America&#x27;s financial system.

American Jews in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries played a major role in developing America&#x27;s financial services industry, both at investment banks and with investment funds. German Jewish bankers began to assume a major role in American finance in the 1830s when government and private borrowing to pay for canals, railroads and other internal improvements increased rapidly and significantly. Men such as August Belmont (Rothschild&#x27;s agent in New York and a leading Democrat), Philip Speyer, Jacob Schiff (at Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company), Joseph Seligman, Philip Lehman (of Lehman Brothers), Jules Bache, and Marcus Goldman (of Goldman Sachs) illustrate this financial elite. As was true of their non-Jewish counterparts, family, personal, and business connections, a reputation for honesty and integrity, ability, and a willingness to take calculated risks were essential to recruit capital from widely scattered sources. The families and the firms which they controlled were bound together by religious and social factors, and by the prevalence of intermarriage. These personal ties fulfilled real business functions before the advent of institutional organization in the 20th century. Antisemitic elements often falsely targeted them as key players in a supposed Jewish cabal conspiring to dominate the world.

Since the late 20th century, Jews have played a major role in the hedge fund industry, according to Zuckerman (2009). Thus SAC Capital Advisors, Soros Fund Management, Och-Ziff Capital Management, GLG Partners Renaissance Technologies and Elliott Management Corporation are large hedge funds cofounded by Jews. They have also played a pivotal role in the private equity industry, co-founding some of the largest firms in the United States, such as Blackstone, Cerberus Capital Management, TPG Capital, BlackRock, Carlyle Group, Warburg Pincus, and KKR.

Very few Jewish lawyers were hired by White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (&quot;WASP&quot;) upscale white-shoe law firms, but they started their own. The WASP dominance in law ended when a number of major Jewish law firms attained elite status in dealing with top-ranked corporations. As late as 1950 there was not a single large Jewish law firm in New York City. However, by 1965 six of the 20 largest firms were Jewish; by 1980 four of the ten largest were Jewish.

====Federal Reserve====
Paul Warburg, one of the leading advocates of the establishment of a central bank in the United States and one of the first governors of the newly established Federal Reserve System, came from a prominent Jewish family in Germany. Since then, several Jews have served as chairmen of the Fed, including Eugene Meyer, Arthur F. Burns, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.

===Science, business, and academia===
Many Jews have become remarkably successful as an entrepreneurial and professional minority in the United States. Many Jewish family businesses that are passed down from one generation to the next serve as an asset, source of income and layer a strong financial groundwork for the family&#x27;s overall socioeconomic prosperity. Within the Jewish American cultural sphere, Jewish Americans have also developed a strong culture of entrepreneurship, for excellence in entrepreneurship and engagement in business and commerce is highly prized in Jewish culture. American Jews have also been drawn to various disciplines within academia such as physics, sociology, economics, psychology, mathematics, philosophy and linguistics (see Jewish culture for some of the causes), and have played a disproportionate role in numerous academic domains. Jewish American intellectuals such as Saul Bellow, Ayn Rand, Noam Chomsky, Thomas Friedman, Milton Friedman and Elie Wiesel have made a major impact within mainstream American public life. Of American Nobel Prize winners, 37 percent have been Jewish Americans (18 times the percentage of Jews in the population), as have been 61 percent of the John Bates Clark Medal in economics recipients (thirty-five times the Jewish percentage).

In the business world, it was found in 1995 that while Jewish Americans constituted less than 2.5 percent of the U.S. population, they occupied 7.7 percent of board seats at various U.S. corporations. American Jews also have a strong presence in NBA ownership. Of the 30 teams in the NBA, there are 14 Jewish principal owners. Several Jews have served as NBA commissioners including prior NBA commissioner David Stern and current commissioner Adam Silver.

Since many careers in science, business, and academia generally pay well, Jewish Americans also tend to have a somewhat higher average income than most Americans. The 2000–2001 National Jewish Population Survey shows that the median income of a Jewish family is $54,000 a year ($5,000 more than the average family) and 34% of Jewish households report income over $75,000 a year.

===Food===
Jewish American people have had a large effect on the cuisine of the United States, with several kosher-style delicatessens achieving mainstream popularity and defining American Jewish culture. For that reason, American Jewish food is typically associated with Ashkenazi cuisine, including foods such as bagels, knish, gefilte fish, kreplach, matzoh ball soup, hamantash, lox, kugel, pastrami, and brisket. Other Jewish communities, such as the Sephardic community, have influenced the dishes served at American restaurants, particularly in New York City.

<text>José Mário Sperry (born 28 September 1966) is a Brazilian heavyweight mixed martial artist. His specialty is Brazilian jiu-jitsu, grappling and ground fighting. He is also one of the founders of the Brazilian Top Team, where he trained fighters such as Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira, Antônio Rogério Nogueira, Ricardo Arona, and Paulo Filho, among others.

== Career ==

Born into a wealthy family, he attended military college where he practised sports like Waterpolo, Volleyball, and Soccer, Sperry started his martial arts career learning Kodokan Judo under master Georges Mehdi. At brown belt level, he expanded his training to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with Carlson Gracie, becoming one of his main apprentices. Mario earned his black belt in this art at the 1995 World BJJ Championships, where he entered to win the heavyweight black belt division, and it was popularly said that until that point he had not lost a single point in his earlier competition career. He gained the nickname &quot;Zé Maquina&quot; (&quot;José Machine&quot;) for his relentless performance, which later changed to &quot;Zen Machine&quot; in his introduction to United States.

Having had his mixed martial arts debut in 1995, Sperry debuted in United States as part of the Extreme Fighting event, where he was billed as having a 272-0 fight record. The first round of the tournament saw him face Ecuadorian fighter and Rudyard Moncayo, whom Sperry defeated by ground and pound, but the second one would see a different outcome in Igor Zinoviev vs Mario Sperry.

Although Sperry was able to take him down and assume dominant position in several occasions, Zinoviev kept escaping to his feet every time. After ten minutes, Sperry tried to leap into a rear naked choke while Zinoviev was giving his back and holding the fence, but he slipped and fell in front of the Russian, receiving a kick to the face. Sperry took Zinoviev down anyway, but the kick had opened a deep cut and Sperry tapped, so the match was stopped to give the win to Igor.

=== ADCC ===
At the first edition of the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championships in 1998, Sperry won the -99 kg division by beating Ricardo Almeida, and the absolute division by beating Ricardo Morais. The following year Sperry beat Enson Inoue to become the first Superfight Champion, and successfully defended against Roberto Traven at the 2000 edition, before being beaten by Mark Kerr for the championship in 2001. In January 2022, Sperry was announced as a member of the inaugural class of the ADCC Hall of Fame.

===PRIDE===
In 2001, Sperry debuted in Pride Fighting Championships, where the Brazilian Top Team was competing. His first match would be an important victory against Igor Vovchanchyn, who was taken down and submitted by arm triangle choke by Sperry. He then went to fought Murilo Rua from Chute Boxe, a team that would get in a rivalry with BTT after this match. Beginning the fight, Rua landed multiple hits in Sperry both standing and on the ground, but Sperry countered with a triangle armbar attempt and tried to get position; however, Rua escaped and landed more strikes, including a soccer kick to the face. At the second round, Sperry came near of the finish with a rolling kneebar and a Kimura lock, but Murilo was able to avoid them and threw several knees to the head. Finally, Rua punished Sperry for most of the third round for a unanimous decision.
Mario rebounded back from his loss by defeating Russian Top Team&#x27;s counterpart Andrei Kopylov, a former world sambo champion. As Kopylov played defensive on the mat, Sperry threw kicks and strikes, cutting him in the mouth for a doctor stoppage while Kopylov was trying a kneebar. Later, in PRIDE Shockwave 2003, Mario faced Pancrase&#x27;s rising star Yuki Kondo in a back and forth match. They exchanged leglocks on the mat, and later Sperry scored a spectacular takedown, but damage to his eye caused by earlier punches forced the referee to stop the bout.

In 2004, Sperry returned to PRIDE as part of the PRIDE Bushido series, where he knocked out Mike Bencic with a single punch. The next year, he fought Judoka Hirotaka Yokoi in a one-sided affair, with Sperry punishing a turtled up Yokoi with knees and soccer kicks for the win. Mario&#x27;s last fight in the promotion would be against Yokoi&#x27;s trainer, the renowned Tsuyoshi &quot;TK&quot; Kohsaka, in 2006. The bout was short, with the two fighters trading punches before Kohsaka landed a right hand for the KO.

== Personal life ==
Mario has a daughter who was born in March 2005. Sperry is also an avid competitive surfer. Aside from his fighting career, he has a degree in economics.

<text>North Waziristan District (, ) is a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. It is the northern part of Waziristan, a mountainous region of northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan and covering . The capital city of North Waziristan is Miranshah.

== Overview and history ==
North Waziristan comprises the area west and south-west of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa between the Kurram River (Tochi) to the north and the Gomal River to the south. Miranshah is district headquarter of North Waziristan. The city of Bannu lies immediately to the east, while the largest town on the Afghan side of the border is Khost.

==Pakistan&#x27;s new Waziristan strategy==

On 4 June 2007, the National Security Council of Pakistan met to decide the fate of Waziristan and take up a number of political and administrative decisions to control &quot;Talibanization&quot; of the area. The meeting was chaired by president Pervez Musharraf and it was attended by the Chief Ministers and Governors of all four provinces. They discussed the deteriorating law and order situation and the threat posed to state security.

The government decided to take a number of actions to stop the &quot;Talibanization&quot; and crush the armed militancy in the Tribal regions and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The NSC of Pakistan has decided the following actions will be taken to achieve the goals:

*Deployment of unmanned reconnaissance planes
*Strengthening law-enforcement agencies with advanced equipment
*Deployment of more troops to the region
*Operations against militants on fast-track basis
*Focused operations against militant commanders
*Action against madrassahs preaching militancy
*Appointment of regional coordinators
*Fresh recruitments of police officers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

The ministry of interior has played a large part in the information gathering for the operations against militants and their institutions. The Ministry of Interior has prepared a list of militant commanders operating in the region and they have also prepared a list of seminaries for monitoring.

The government is also trying to strengthen the law enforcement in the area by providing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police with weapons, bulletproof jackets and night-vision devices. The paramilitary Frontier Corps will be provided with artillery and APC&#x27;s. The state agencies are also working on studying ways to block FM frequencies of illegal FM radio channels.

<text>Llangeitho is a village and community on the upper River Aeron in Ceredigion, Wales, about four miles (6 km) west of Tregaron and north of Lampeter. Its population of 874 in 2001 fell to 819 at the 2011 census.

==Nonconformism==
The village is linked with Daniel Rowland, born here in 1713, and the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century. Rowland served as curate at Llangeitho and Nantcwnlle. The village chapel, built in 1760, became famous throughout Wales as a Calvinistic Methodist centre. Thousands visited it to hear the preaching. Rowland was buried in the village and there remains a memorial column to him. Larger replacement chapels were built in 1764 and 1814.

Llangeitho saw several further periods of religious revival in that century, the strongest in 1762, when rejoicing, dancing and jumping for joy earned the Welsh Methodists the nickname &quot;Jumpers&quot;. William Williams Pantycelyn wrote in defence of the celebrations.
==Language==
Like much of Ceredigion, Llangeitho was a stronghold of the Welsh language, but in the 1970s newcomers contributed to a decline in the proportion of habitual Welsh speakers from 83 per cent in 1971 to 55 per cent ten years later, and again in 2011.

The Welsh-language poet and minstrel Dafydd Llwyd Mathau (c. 1601–1629) is thought to have come from the Llangeitho area.

About a mile and half (2.4 km) north of the village is the mansion of Cwrt Mawr, where the antiquary J. H. Davies (1871–1926) built up a valuable collection of Welsh-language manuscripts known as the Cwrtmawr manuscripts. He donated them to the National Library of Wales, where they remain.

==Church==
The village church, across the river to the north of the village, is on an ancient site, but the current church was wholly rebuilt in 1821, retaining nothing of the medieval fabric, which included a double rood screen and three arches.

The church and parish are named after St Ceitho. The water of St Ceitho&#x27;s Spring is said to have the peculiarity of being cool in summer and tepid in winter.

==School==
The village primary school, Ysgol Gymunedol Llangeitho, changed names in 2012 due to an amalgamation becoming Ysgol Rhos y Helyg. The nearest secondary school is Ysgol Henry Richard in Tregaron, which teaches in Welsh and English.

The earliest record of a school in the village marks the foundation of a mixed, Calvinistic Methodist school there in 1821.

==Governance==
Llangeitho gained a seat on Cardiganshire County Council in 1889. In November 2019, the Llangeitho member of what is now Ceredigion County Council was David Rhodri Wyn Evans. The ward extends to some neighbouring communities, giving a population of 1,459.

<doc id="1131202" wikidata="Q3308117" url="?curid=1131202" title="Michael Coleman (fiddler)">
<text>Michael Coleman (31 January 1891 – 4 January 1945) was a virtuoso Irish fiddler from County Sligo, and a major exponent of the Sligo fiddle style.

==Early years==
Michael Coleman was born in Knockgrania, in the rural Killavil district, near Ballymote, County Sligo, Ireland. His father, James Coleman, was from Banada in County Roscommon, and a respected flute player. Michael was the seventh child of James and Beatrice, and the surviving half of a pair of twins.

As a child he learned step dancing and fiddle playing, and performed at local houses. His elder brother Jim had a high reputation but was never recorded. In his formative years Michael was influenced by Uilleann pipers (a type of bagpipe), including Johnny Gorman.

He left school in 1908, at the age of 17. He competed at the Sligo Feis Ceoil in 1909 and again in 1910, and was placed joint third on both occasions. In 1914 he moved to Manchester, England to live with his older brother Pat, but returned home after several months.

==Immigration to the United States==
In October 1914, at the age of twenty-three, Coleman sailed to America with his friend John Hunt. Initially he stayed with his aunt in Lowell, Massachusetts and briefly joined the Keith Theatres vaudeville circuit. In 1917, he settled in New York City, and married Marie Fanning, originally from County Monaghan, Ireland. They had one child, Mary.

==Recording years==
Between 1921 and 1936, Coleman recorded eighty commercial 78-rpm records for many record labels, including Shannon, Vocalion Records, Columbia Records, Okeh Records, New Republic, Pathe, O&#x27;Beirne de Witt, Victor Records, Brunswick Records, and Decca Records. Some of these were re-issued under the Intrepid, International Recording Company, Coral Records, Ace of Hearts Records, and Shanachie Records labels.

Coleman was usually accompanied by one of the following pianists: Kathleen Brennan, Arthur P. Kenna, John Muller, Eileen O’Shea, Edward Lee, and Ed Geoghegan. However, on three 1934 78 discs (six sides) for the Decca label, Coleman was accompanied by tenor guitar player Michael &quot;Whitey&quot; Andrews. Flute players Tom Morrison and Michael Walsh, and piccolo player Paddy Finlay, separately accompanied Coleman on a few of his 1920s recordings. In 1940, Coleman recorded four solo aluminum acetates for private collector James Carroll at the Wurlitzer Studios in New York, NY. In 1944, Coleman recorded ten tracks for the Decca controlled World Broadcasting Company on two, separate, 16-inch transcription discs. These were Coleman&#x27;s final studio recordings, but they were never issued commercially.

==Musical style==
Coleman was the most famous exponent of what is today known as the Sligo style of Irish fiddling, which is fast, flamboyant, and heavily ornamented with fingered &quot;rolls&quot; and bowed triplets. Coleman was also an excellent dancer and performer. Coleman danced and played the fiddle at the same time, as confirmed by his daughter Mary, on the Irish film, &quot;From Shore to Shore&quot;. James Morrison, Paddy Killoran and Paddy Sweeney were other famed Sligo fiddlers who also recorded in New York in the 1920s and &#x27;30s. While these musicians shared a basic approach and much common repertoire, there were noticeable differences in their playing. Coleman in particular employed extensive melodic variations, and his settings of tunes such as &quot;The Boys of the Lough,&quot; &quot;Bonny Kate&quot; and &quot;Lord Gordon&#x27;s&quot; have become part of the standard Irish fiddle repertoire. Some of Coleman&#x27;s records were reissued on British labels and others reached Ireland as American imports, heavily influencing a new generation of fiddlers in Sligo and elsewhere.

==Legacy==
Coleman died at Knickerbocker Hospital in New York City on January 4, 1945, and is buried in St. Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx. Even after his death, Coleman&#x27;s influence on traditional fiddle playing is substantial. Every generation since has been influenced by his recordings either directly or indirectly. Most notably, he has influenced fiddle players such as James &quot;Lad&quot; O&#x27;Beirne, Martin Wynne, Andy McGann, Ben Lennon, Martin Byrnes, Jean &quot;Ti-Jean&quot; Carignan and many others.

In 1974, a monument was erected by the Coleman Traditional Society. It is close to his birthplace, on the Tubbercurry to Gurteen road. Nearby is the Coleman Heritage Centre, a music archive and a replica of the house where he lived. The monument bears this inscription:

:&quot;Michael Coleman. Master of the fiddle. Saviour of Irish traditional music. Born near this spot in 1891. Died in exile 1945.&quot;

In March 2015, the U.S. Library of Congress chose its annual list of sound recordings for inclusion in its National Recording Registry. Among those chosen were Coleman&#x27;s 1922 Vocalion Records release of his rendition of &quot;The Boys of the Lough&quot; and &quot;The Humors of Ennistymon&quot;.

<doc id="1131214" wikidata="Q951066" url="?curid=1131214" title="Léon Brunschvicg">
<text>Léon Brunschvicg (; 10 November 1869 – 18 January 1944) was a French Idealist philosopher. He co-founded the &quot;Revue de métaphysique et de morale&quot; with Xavier Léon and Élie Halévy in 1893.

==Life==
He was born into a Jewish family.

From 1895 to 1900 he taught at the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen. In 1897 he completed his thesis under the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Modalities of Judgement&quot;). In 1909 he became professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne. He was married to Cécile Kahn, a major campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage in France, with whom he had four children.

While at the Sorbonne, Brunschvicg was the supervisor for Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis.

Forced to leave his position at the Sorbonne by the Nazis, Brunschvicg fled to the south of France, where he died at the age of 74. While in hiding, he wrote studies of Montaigne, Descartes, and Pascal that were printed in Switzerland. He composed a manual of philosophy dedicated to his teenage granddaughter entitled &quot;Héritage de Mots, Héritage d&#x27;Idées&quot; (&quot;Legacy of Words, Legacy of Ideas&quot;) which was published posthumously after the liberation of France. His reinterpretation of Descartes has become the foundation for a new idealism.

Brunschvicg defined philosophy as &quot;the mind&#x27;s methodical self-reflection&quot; and gave a central role to judgement.

The publication of Brunschvicg&#x27;s oeuvre has been recently completed after unpublished materials held in Russia were returned to his family in 2001.

<text>Tasman Bay (; officially Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere), originally known in English as Blind Bay, is a large V-shaped bay at the north end of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Located in the centre of the island&#x27;s northern coast, it stretches along of coastline and is across at its widest point. It is an arm of the Tasman Sea, lying on the western approach to Cook Strait.

At the bay&#x27;s western extremity, the land around the bay is rough and densely forested. Separation Point, the westernmost point of the bay, is located in Abel Tasman National Park and separates Tasman Bay from its smaller neighbour, Golden Bay. To the east, the land is also steep, with the westernmost points of sea-drowned valleys of the Marlborough Sounds. D&#x27;Urville Island sits to the northeast of Tasman Bay&#x27;s easternmost point. Arrow Rock is situated off the coast of Nelson.

The land between these two extremes is more gently rolling, and also includes the coastal plains around the mouth of the Waimea River at the bay&#x27;s southernmost point. Other rivers entering the sea along the coast of the bay include the Riwaka, the Motueka and Maitai Rivers. The long low form of Rabbit Island is located close to the bay&#x27;s south coast. Tasman Bay contains the rare rock formation known as the Boulder Bank.

The fertile land around the centre of the bay&#x27;s coast is extensively cultivated and known for its horticultural crops such as apples, kiwifruit, olives, grapes and hops. In the middle of the twentieth century the Tasman Bay area produced large crops of tobacco. There is a tobacco museum in Motueka. It is also the most densely populated part of the South Island&#x27;s north coast, and several towns and the city of Nelson are all located close to the shore. These towns include Riwaka, Motueka, Māpua and Richmond.

==History==

The location&#x27;s original name, Blind Bay, was given by Captain Cook in 1770. The name of the bay was officially altered to Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere in August 2014.

<text>The National Carillon is a large carillon situated on Queen Elizabeth II Island in Lake Burley Griffin, central Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The carillon is managed and maintained by the National Capital Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. It has 57 bells, ranging nearly 5 octaves from the bass bell in F# to the treble bell in D.

== History ==
The carillon was a gift from the British government to the people of Australia to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the national capital, Canberra. The structure was the subject of a limited competition between three selected Australian architects and three selected British architects. Assessors of the competition were Lord Holford, Sir Donald Gibson and Sir John Overall (Chairman of the National Capital Development Commission). The winners were the Western Australian firm of Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The carillon was designed in 1967, built during 1969 and completed in 1970. The three columns of the design symbolise the British and Australian governments and the City of Canberra. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the National Carillon on 26 April 1970. The carillon has a symbolic value in the link between Britain and Australia. It also has some historic value for its association with the commemoration of the 50th jubilee of the founding of Canberra. The tower stands tall. The concept was developed in 1968 by Don Ho, an architect at Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The carillon bells and mechanism were designed and constructed by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough, England. 

The carillon is a good example of the late twentieth century Brutalist style. Its use of strong shapes which are boldly composed, the diagonal line of the roofs, large areas of blank wall, use of precast non-load-bearing wall panels and strongly vertical windows and openings are all features of this style.

=== 2019 upgrade ===
In 2019, the carillon was upgraded with a new clavier, a fully replaced transmission and the addition of two new bells to add the lowest semitone and a new highest bell. The new lowest semitone bell was called the Ngunnawal bell, in recognition of the first peoples of the Canberra region. This bell weighs just over 5 tonnes and sounds the note G. The other bell added was a new lightest bell to extend the range of the instrument to nearly 5 octaves. This work was carried out by John Taylor &amp; Co.

The work was delayed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Characteristics ==
Carillons must have at least 23 bells to be considered as such, and the National Carillon has 57. It was initially installed with 53, and increased to 55 during refurbishments in 2003-2004. Each bell weighs between and . The bells span four and a half octaves chromatically. John Douglas Gordon, after whom the Queen Elizabeth II Island footbridge is now named, played the inaugural recital.

The carillon features moderate-size function facilities for small gatherings offering views over Lake Burley Griffin and central Canberra.

The carillon is in regular use, chiming every quarter-hour and playing a short tune on the hour along with tours and recitals on many days. For example, there is usually a recital of carols on Christmas Eve each year with music being played for around an hour at dusk. The best place to listen to the carillon is suggested to be within of the building though the sound can usually be heard much further away in the Parliamentary Triangle, Kingston and Civic.

The quarter-hourly chimes of the National Carillon are reminiscent of those of Big Ben at London&#x27;s Houses of Parliament.

=== Links to memorials ===
The adjacent National Workers Memorial was constructed with the idea that people attending would hear the sound of bells from the carillon, which would assist them in remembering their loved ones.

<doc id="1131227" wikidata="Q256326" url="?curid=1131227" title="Welsh Methodist revival">
<text>The Welsh Methodist revival was an evangelical revival that revitalised Christianity in Wales during the 18th century. Methodist preachers such as Daniel Rowland, William Williams and Howell Harris were heavily influential in the movement. The revival led eventually to the establishment of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists as a denomination (now more commonly known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales) and it also revitalised older dissenting churches.

==Beginnings==
The revival&#x27;s immediate beginnings are usually traced to the religious conversion of Howell Harris at Talgarth church in 1735. While listening to the Rev. Pryce Davies preaching on the necessity of partaking of Holy Communion, Harris came to the conviction that he had received mercy through the blood of Christ. He began to tell others about this and to hold meetings at his home at Trefeca for these followers.

Many consider Griffith Jones (1684–1761), the rector of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire to have been a forerunner of the Methodist movement in Wales. Through his circulating schools he taught thousands in Wales to read the Bible and created a generation of people which would be receptive to Methodist ideas. He also preached in the open air as later Methodist leaders would do. In fact, the newly converted Harris visited him for spiritual guidance and direction, and it was through his preaching that Daniel Rowland was converted and began to preach Methodist ideas.

The other major leader of the early revival was William Williams, Pantycelyn. He was converted in 1737 as he listened to Harris preaching in Talgarth churchyard.

==Jumpers==
Following the Llangeitho revival of 1762 members of the revival were often known as &quot;Jumpers&quot; on account of their habit of jumping for joy. This nickname particularly stuck after William Pantycelyn wrote &quot;Llythyr Martha Philopur at y Parchedig Philo Evangelius eu hathro&quot; (Martha Philopur&#x27;s letter to the Reverend Philo Evangelius her teacher) followed by &quot;Atteb Philo-Evangelius i Martha Philopur&quot; (Philo-Evangelius&#x27;s reply to Martha Philopur). These texts attempted to teach and defend the practices of the revival including that of jumping. The nickname juxtaposed them with Quakers (who &#x27;quaked&#x27;) and Shakers (who &#x27;shook&#x27;).

==A movement==
Rowland and Harris had been at work for eighteen months before they met at Defynnog church in 1737. This led to a friendship that lasted, with a ten-year break in fellowship, until Harris&#x27;s death in 1773.

Methodist leaders met regularly to organise their work and to agree on matters of common interest.

Harris and Williams undertook major preaching journeys, starting in South Wales but later venturing north. As they preached they made converts, whom they then gathered together into organised groups of fellowships (known as &quot;seiadau&quot; (societies) in Welsh). As more converts were made, more evangelists were also created, and by 1750 there were over 400 such fellowship groups in Wales. These groups were supervised by the leaders and were built into a powerful network within the Church of England.

Rowland concentrated his efforts on Llangeitho which became a centre for the movement. On Communion Sundays thousands of the members of the &quot;seiadau&quot; would travel there to receive the sacrament.

==A Calvinist movement==

The Welsh Methodist revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was Calvinist rather than Arminian. At the beginning the leaders worked with John Wesley, but gradually they parted company from Wesley and became associated with George Whitfield and his patron, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon.

==Welsh Methodists and other denominations==

The Methodist revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it. But its success meant that Methodists gradually built their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1823.

The Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older nonconformist churches, or dissenters—the Baptists and the Congregationalists—who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a nonconformist country.

<doc id="1131230" wikidata="Q2942214" url="?curid=1131230" title="Cathy Rogers">
<text>Cathy Rogers (born 29 May 1968) is an English television executive, producer, presenter and musician. She was the presenter of the British reality competition series &quot;Scrapheap Challenge&quot; and its American counterpart &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot;. She is also known for being the keyboardist and backing singer for the indie pop bands Heavenly and Marine Research. She has since trained as an educational neuroscientist.

Rogers was born in Lancashire, England. She studied medicine at the University of Oxford, earning a master&#x27;s degree in Health Policy. Rogers joined the BBC as a producer in the early 1990s, specialising in scientific documentaries, including work on the long-running series &quot;Horizon&quot;. During the same period, she played keyboards and sang vocals in the twee pop group Heavenly.

In 1995 Rogers moved to the independent production company RDF Media, where she helped devise and produced the popular Channel 4 technology reality game show &quot;Scrapheap Challenge&quot;, known in North America as &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot;. She appeared onscreen as co-presenter of &quot;Scrapheap Challenge&quot; from the second series onwards until 2001 when Lisa Rogers (no relation) took over, and of &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; for the first three series until replaced by Karyn Bryant. She also created and hosted a related programme, &quot;Full Metal Challenge&quot;. She continued her popular music career as well, playing with the Heavenly spinoff Marine Research in the late 1990s.

In 2001, Rogers was promoted to creative director at RDF Media&#x27;s new Los Angeles centre, where she oversaw the company&#x27;s activities in the United States, including the American versions of popular shows such as &quot;Faking It&quot; and &quot;Wife Swap&quot;. She then ran an olive farm in Loro Piceno, Italy, and set up a tree adoption scheme. She published an account of her time in Italy as &quot;The Dolce Vita Diaries&quot;. In 2009 she returned to RDF Media as creative director.

She subsequently completed a PhD in Educational Neuroscience at Birkbeck, University of London and has published an introduction to the field.

Banana is located at the intersection of the Dawson and Leichhardt highways, west of the shire&#x27;s administrative centre, Biloela.

== History ==
&quot;Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River.

In 1853, James, Norman and Charles Leith-Hay established the Rannes pastoral lease and Banana was an outstation of this property. Banana became its own squatting leasehold sheep station property in 1855 with the Leith-Hays and Thomas Holt holding the licence. In 1855 a group of Aboriginal people attacked Banana Station wounding five people and stealing 3,000 sheep. In April 1858, a number of Aboriginal people in an unprovoked attack, murdered 4 men at Camboon and had stolen a carbine, gun powder and balls, and some axes. They then proceeded to attack the sheep station at Banana resulting in three shepherds being wounded. While the shepherds were defending themselves, an Aboriginal man was killed. Native Police troopers were deployed to patrol the area and a 1859 map shows a police station marked on the planned site for Banana.

The name Banana derives from an old dun-coloured working bullock, called &quot;Banana&quot;, used by local stockmen to help them when herding some of the wilder cattle into the yards.

The post office at Banana was established on 1 September 1861, and the first township allotments were offered for sale in that same year.

In 1887, there was a minor gold rush at Banana, increasing the population by a few hundred people.

Banana Provisional School opened on 18 September 1871 and was upgraded to Banana State School on 16 February 1874. The school closed in 1935, but reopened on 25 January 1960.

In 1880, the local government area Banana Division (later the Shire of Banana) was established with its headquarters in Banana (taking its name from the town). However, in 1930 the shire headquarters became Rannes and the shire offices were physically relocated from Banana to Rannes. Since 1946, the shire has its headquarters in Biloela.

The mobile library service commenced in 2004.

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Banana had a population of 627 people.

In the , the locality of Banana had a population of 377 people.

In the , the locality of Banana had a population of 356 people.

In the , the locality of Banana had a population of 348 people.

== Economy ==
The beef industry is still a mainstay of the town and area, along with coal and agriculture.

== Education ==
Banana State School is a government primary (P-6) school for boys and girls at 32-36 Bramston Street (). In 2012, there were 37 students enrolled with 3 teachers (2.5 full-time equivalent).

There are no secondary schools in Banana; the nearest government secondary schools are Moura State High School in neighbouring Moura to the west and Biloela State High School in Biloela to the east.

== Amenities ==

Banana has a Uniting Church at 39 Bowen Street (Leichhardt Highway) at the corner with North Street ().

Banana Shire Council operate a fortnightly mobile library service to Banana and the school.

The Banana branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at 123 Bramston Street.

<text>Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) is a soil sample extraction method for chemical analysis employed as an analytical method to simulate leaching through a landfill. The testing methodology is used to determine if a waste is characteristically hazardous, i.e., classified as one of the &quot;D&quot; listed wastes by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The extract is analyzed for substances appropriate to the protocol.
==Background==
In the United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 led to establishment of federal standards for the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste. RCRA requires that industrial wastes and other wastes must be characterized following testing protocols published by EPA. TCLP is one of these tests.

==Application of test==
The Environmental Compliance Supervisor at a typical municipal landfill (as defined by RCRA Subtitle D) uses TCLP data to determine whether a waste may be accepted into the facility. If TCLP analytical results are below the TCLP D-list maximum contamination levels (MCLs) the waste can be accepted. If they are above these levels the waste must be taken to a hazardous waste disposal facility and the cost of disposal may increase from about $50.00/ton to as much as $1200.00/ton.

As extremely contaminated material is expensive to dispose of, grading is necessary to ensure safe disposal and to avoid paying for disposal of &quot;clean fill.&quot; The TCLP procedure is generally useful for classifying waste material for disposal options. 

Spent abrasive or soil from a construction site usually needs to have a TCLP for lead done to determine where the waste goes next.

==Procedure==
TCLP comprises four fundamental procedures:
* Sample preparation for leaching
* Sample leaching
* Preparation of leachate for analysis
* Leachate analysis

In the TCLP procedure the pH of the sample material is first established, and then leached with an acetic acid / sodium hydroxide solution at a 1:20 mix of sample to solvent. For example, a TCLP jug may contain 100g of sample and 2000 mL of solution. The leachate mixture is sealed in extraction vessel for general analytes, or possibly pressure sealed as in zero-headspace extractions (ZHE) for volatile organic compounds and tumbled for 18 hours to simulate an extended leaching time in the ground. It is then filtered so that only the solution (not the sample) remains and this is then analyzed.

<doc id="1131243" wikidata="Q1182160" url="?curid=1131243" title="Dedekind zeta function">
<text>In mathematics, the Dedekind zeta function of an algebraic number field &quot;K&quot;, generally denoted ζ&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), is a generalization of the Riemann zeta function (which is obtained in the case where &quot;K&quot; is the field of rational numbers Q). It can be defined as a Dirichlet series, it has an Euler product expansion, it satisfies a functional equation, it has an analytic continuation to a meromorphic function on the complex plane C with only a simple pole at &quot;s&quot; = 1, and its values encode arithmetic data of &quot;K&quot;. The extended Riemann hypothesis states that if &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = 0 and 0 &lt; Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 1, then Re(&quot;s&quot;) = 1/2.

The Dedekind zeta function is named for Richard Dedekind who introduced it in his supplement to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie.

==Definition and basic properties==
Let &quot;K&quot; be an algebraic number field. Its Dedekind zeta function is first defined for complex numbers &quot;s&quot; with real part Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1 by the Dirichlet series

:formula_1

where &quot;I&quot; ranges through the non-zero ideals of the ring of integers &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;K&quot;/Q(&quot;I&quot;) denotes the absolute norm of &quot;I&quot; (which is equal to both the index [&quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; : &quot;I&quot;] of &quot;I&quot; in &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; or equivalently the cardinality of the quotient ring &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; / &quot;I&quot;). This sum converges absolutely for all complex numbers &quot;s&quot; with real part Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1. In the case &quot;K&quot; = Q, this definition reduces to that of the Riemann zeta function.

===Euler product===
The Dedekind zeta function of formula_2 has an Euler product which is a product over all the non-zero prime ideals formula_3 of formula_4

:formula_5

This is the expression in analytic terms of the uniqueness of prime factorization of ideals in formula_4. For formula_7 is non-zero.

===Analytic continuation and functional equation===
Erich Hecke first proved that &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) has an analytic continuation to a meromorphic function that is analytic at all points of the complex plane except for one simple pole at &quot;s&quot; = 1. The residue at that pole is given by the analytic class number formula and is made up of important arithmetic data involving invariants of the unit group and class group of &quot;K&quot;.

The Dedekind zeta function satisfies a functional equation relating its values at &quot;s&quot; and 1 − &quot;s&quot;. Specifically, let Δ&quot;K&quot; denote the discriminant of &quot;K&quot;, let &quot;r&quot;1 (resp. &quot;r&quot;2) denote the number of real places (resp. complex places) of &quot;K&quot;, and let

:formula_8

and

:formula_9

where Γ(&quot;s&quot;) is the gamma function. Then, the functions

:formula_10

satisfy the functional equation

:formula_11

==Special values==
Analogously to the Riemann zeta function, the values of the Dedekind zeta function at integers encode (at least conjecturally) important arithmetic data of the field &quot;K&quot;. For example, the analytic class number formula relates the residue at &quot;s&quot; = 1 to the class number &quot;h&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of &quot;K&quot;, the regulator &quot;R&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of &quot;K&quot;, the number &quot;w&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of roots of unity in &quot;K&quot;, the absolute discriminant of &quot;K&quot;, and the number of real and complex places of &quot;K&quot;. Another example is at &quot;s&quot; = 0 where it has a zero whose order &quot;r&quot; is equal to the rank of the unit group of &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; and the leading term is given by

:formula_12

It follows from the functional equation that formula_13.
Combining the functional equation and the fact that Γ(&quot;s&quot;) is infinite at all integers less than or equal to zero yields that &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) vanishes at all negative even integers. It even vanishes at all negative odd integers unless &quot;K&quot; is totally real (i.e. &quot;r&quot;2 = 0; e.g. Q or a real quadratic field). In the totally real case, Carl Ludwig Siegel showed that &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is a non-zero rational number at negative odd integers. Stephen Lichtenbaum conjectured specific values for these rational numbers in terms of the algebraic K-theory of &quot;K&quot;.

==Relations to other &quot;L&quot;-functions==
For the case in which &quot;K&quot; is an abelian extension of Q, its Dedekind zeta function can be written as a product of Dirichlet L-functions. For example, when &quot;K&quot; is a quadratic field this shows that the ratio

:formula_14

is the &quot;L&quot;-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, χ), where χ is a Jacobi symbol used as Dirichlet character. That the zeta function of a quadratic field is a product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-function is an analytic formulation of the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss.

In general, if &quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group &quot;G&quot;, its Dedekind zeta function is the Artin &quot;L&quot;-function of the regular representation of &quot;G&quot; and hence has a factorization in terms of Artin &quot;L&quot;-functions of irreducible Artin representations of &quot;G&quot;.

The relation with Artin L-functions shows that if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension then formula_15 is holomorphic (formula_16 &quot;divides&quot; formula_17): for general extensions the result would follow from the Artin conjecture for L-functions.

Additionally, &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is the Hasse–Weil zeta function of Spec &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; and the motivic &quot;L&quot;-function of the motive coming from the cohomology of Spec &quot;K&quot;.

==Arithmetically equivalent fields==

Two fields are called arithmetically equivalent if they have the same Dedekind zeta function. used Gassmann triples to give some examples of pairs of non-isomorphic fields that are arithmetically equivalent. In particular some of these pairs have different class numbers, so the Dedekind zeta function of a number field does not determine its class number.

 showed that two number fields &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are arithmetically equivalent if and only if all but finitely many prime numbers &quot;p&quot; have the same inertia degrees in the two fields, i.e., if formula_18 are the prime ideals in &quot;K&quot; lying over &quot;p&quot;, then the tuples formula_19 need to be the same for &quot;K&quot; and for &quot;L&quot; for almost all &quot;p&quot;.

<doc id="1131244" wikidata="Q13471238" url="?curid=1131244" title="David Davis (Australian politician)">
<text>David McLean Davis (born 8 April 1962) is an Australian politician. He has been a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council since March 1996, representing East Yarra Province from 1996 until 2006 when it was abolished and the Southern Metropolitan Region from 2006 onwards. He was state Minister for Health from 2010 to 2014 under Premiers Ted Baillieu and Denis Napthine.

==Early career==
Davis was born in Millicent, South Australia and studied in Melbourne, Victoria. He was educated at Kingswood College (Box Hill). He studied applied science at the Phillip Institute of Technology (now part of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Davis also later studied philosophy at the University of Melbourne. He worked as a chiropractor and maintained a private practice until being elected to the Legislative Council in 1996.

==Political career==
Davis had become involved with the Liberal Party during the early 1990s, serving as a delegate on several party committees, and acting as a delegate to the party&#x27;s State Council between 1993 and 1995. This was to ultimately result in receiving preselection for the safe Liberal seat of East Yarra at the 1996 state election. After the Liberal Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1999 state election, Davis became the Chair of the Opposition Waste Watch Committee. In this position, he was one of the Labor government&#x27;s strongest critics, regularly making claims of perceived abuses. In 2000, he became the Parliamentary Secretary for Scrutiny of Government.

Davis almost lost his seat of East Yarra in the 2002 election, but became Shadow Minister for Health, replacing Ron Wilson, who had lost his seat in the 2002 election. In September 2004, Davis announced that if elected, a Liberal government would ban smoking in pubs and clubs. This was followed by a decision from the state government weeks later to the same effect. Davis was often an opponent of Robert Doyle&#x27;s leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party. In 2005 Doyle transferred Davis to the lower-profile environment portfolio. In May 2006, after Doyle&#x27;s resignation and replacement by Ted Baillieu, Davis was once again promoted and given Baillieu&#x27;s former portfolio of planning.

Following the 2006 election, Davis was again promoted by Baillieu to the position of Shadow Minister for State and Regional Development. In January 2008 he was elected Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council. Between February 2008 and November 2009, Davis was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Environment and Climate Change and in November 2009, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, maintaining his responsibility for Scrutiny of Government.

Davis was appointed Shadow Treasurer in late 2021 following Matthew Guy&#x27;s return to the Liberal leadership.

In February 2022, Davis, along with Matthew Guy, Peter Walsh, Gary Blackwood and Melina Bath, were fined $100 each for breaching face mask rules, after the Coalition MPs were photographed maskless while attending an event in Parliament House.

After incumbent member for Kew Tim Smith confirmed that he would not seek re-election at the 2022 Victorian state election, Davis nominated for preselection for the seat, a move which some believed to be an attempt to succeed Matthew Guy as leader of the Liberal Party should the Liberals fail to win the 2022 state election. Business Council of Australia director Jess Wilson was ultimately endorsed as the Liberal candidate for Kew, defeating Davis 99–64.

In March 2022, Davis was criticised for being ‘hammered’ at a multicultural gala and allegedly &#x27;making people feel uncomfortable by touching, hugging and getting too close to people.&#x27; Davis apologised in a written statement for his behaviour.

David was a member of the &#x27;Kennett faction&#x27; of the Victorian Liberals. He voted for Matthew Guy in his successful 2021 leadership challenge against Michael O’Brien.

<doc id="1131253" wikidata="Q5667653" url="?curid=1131253" title="Harry Butler">
<text>William Henry Butler (25 March 1930 – 11 December 2015) was an Australian naturalist and environmental consultant, best known as the presenter of the popular ABC television series &quot;In the Wild&quot; from 1976 to 1981. He was a household name as he took viewers to remote parts of Australia observing and admiring the natural environment. 

His advocacy led to the establishment of offshore islands as reserves for plants and animals, protected from invasive species. Now his legacy is being remembered with Murdoch University’s Harry Butler Institute. The new research and education facility brings science, business and the community together to address environmental problems.

He spoke highly of how Indigenous people cared for the land. Having extensive knowledge of indigenous culture and vast experience with various language groups throughout Western Australia.

==Biography==
Butler was born on 25 March 1930 in Perth, Western Australia. He attended Claremont Teachers College in Western Australia and later the Western State College in the United States.

Butler co-wrote &quot;Sun Arise&quot; with fellow Western Australian Rolf Harris; the song reached the Top 10 in the UK in 1962.

Butler was a populariser of science and natural history for both child and adult audiences, especially through the ABC television series &quot;In the Wild&quot;, which led to him being named &quot;Australian of the Year&quot; in 1979. He also authored the books &quot;In The Wild&quot;, &quot;In the Wild (Part II)&quot; and &quot;Looking at the Wild&quot;.

As conservation consultant to the Barrow Island oilfield and many other projects, Butler played a major role in environmental conservation and restoration in Australia. In 1968, he participated in the fifth of the Harold Hall Australian ornithological collecting expeditions. He lectured, and was honoured, at museums in Western Australia, Canada, and the United States. Butler was a supporter of development projects such as mining, working with corporations and state governments as an environmental consultant. 

Butler lost some popularity with his support of the construction of the Franklin River Dam in the early 1980s.

He died of cancer, aged 85, at a hospital in Perth on 11 December 2015.

==Honours==
In 1970, Butler was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In 1980 this was upgraded to Commander level (CBE).

In 1979, Butler was named the Australian of the Year, jointly with Neville Bonner.

In 1993, he was awarded a cash prize for his 30 years of work with the petroleum industry.

On 4 March 2012, he was added to the National Trust of Australia&#x27;s National Living Treasures list.

On 11 June 2012, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;distinguished service to the community through the promotion of public understanding of natural history and wildlife conservation, to the development of collaborative environmental partnerships with industry, and to the community.&quot;

A species of mulga snake, &quot;Pseudechis butleri&quot;, and a spider, &quot;Synothele butleri&quot;, are named for Butler. Three species of Australian lizards are named for Butler: &quot;Delma butleri, Morethia butleri&quot;, and &quot;Notoscincus butleri&quot;. Two species of Australian lizards are named for Butler and his wife Margaret: &quot;Ctenophorus butlerorum&quot; and &quot;Eremiascincus butlerorum&quot;.

On 17 April 2016, the new Western Australian Museum research facility and storage centre in Welshpool was named in his honour.

The Harry Butler Institute was established in August 2017 at Murdoch University, in honour of Harry&#x27;s legacy. The sustainable research institute fosters a collaborative research environment that drives innovation for a sustainable future. A Harry Butler Science Centre is in development at Murdoch University.

<doc id="1131264" wikidata="Q728634" url="?curid=1131264" title="Robert de Castella">
<text>Francois Robert de Castella (born 27 February 1957) is an Australian former world champion marathon runner.

De Castella is widely known as &quot;Deek&quot; or &quot;Deeks&quot; to the Australian public, and &quot;Tree&quot; to his competitors due to his thick legs and inner calm. He holds the Oceanic record for the marathon.

==Early life==
De Castella is of French and Swiss-French descent. His family were part of both the French nobility and Swiss nobility. He was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the eldest of seven children. Sport was a way of life in his family – his father Rolet ran marathons in the 1950s. His mother Anne was a state-level tennis player. His brother Nicholas, took part in four World Cross Country Championships, whereas brother Anthony competed in running at club level for more than 25 years. Rob de Castella attended Xavier College in Melbourne where he was an outstanding track athlete and trained under Pat Clohessy from the age of 11.

==Marathon career==
De Castella wanted to represent Australia at the Olympics in Moscow and reckoned his best chance was in the marathon. He won the Australian championship and finished second in the Australian Olympic trials to gain a place on the 1980 Olympic team.

===1980 Olympic Games Moscow===
At his first big international marathon competition, DeCastella finished 10th in a time of 2:14:31, in a field of 74 runners. 21 competitors did not finish. 

===1981 Fukuoka Marathon===
De Castella first came to international attention when he won the 1981 Fukuoka Marathon in a time of 2:08:18, which was the fastest time recorded for an out-and-back course. It was not initially known to be a world best time, because his time was 5 seconds slower than the time set by Alberto Salazar in the 1981 New York City Marathon. It later emerged that the New York course was about 148 metres short. De Castella&#x27;s time was later ratified as the world record.

===1982 Commonwealth Games Marathon===
De Castella was the favourite to win the marathon at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. At the start of the race, Tanzanians Gidamis Shahanga and Juma Ikangaa raced to the lead and were 50 m ahead of the pack after five minutes. After the 20 km mark, this gap had widened to several hundred meters. At the halfway mark, De Castella developed diarrhoea. In 100% humidity, he let go of his bowels and signalled for some damp towels from his crew members. By the 23 km mark, Ikangaa had taken the lead from his compatriot, with de Castella in the main pack some 250 m behind but closing. De Castella passed the now-tiring Shahanga at the 38 km mark, and in the next kilometre drew level with Ikangaa and then took the lead. However, Ikangaa was not done yet, and he re-took the lead slightly. The duel continued for the remainder of the race. Eventually, de Castella pulled away and won by 80 metres in a time of 2:09:18, 12 seconds ahead of Ikangaa. Briton Mike Gratton finished third in 2:12:06, and Shahanga faded to finish 6th. The race finished on the streets of Brisbane, not in the main stadium.

===1983 Rotterdam Marathon===
In April 1983, De Castella defeated a deep field to win the Rotterdam Marathon. The race was billed as a clash between de Castella and Salazar, who at the time was undefeated, and was also televised live back to Australia. De Castella dropped all of the field except Carlos Lopes (who would win the Olympic marathon the next year), and defeated Lopes in a sprint for the finish, winning in a time of 2:08:37. De Castella&#x27;s time was, at that point, the fourth fastest in history.

===1983 IAAF World Championships===

De Castella won Australia&#x27;s first athletic World Championships gold medal when he won the marathon in August 1983, beating Ethiopian Kebede Balcha by 24 seconds and Olympic champion Waldemar Cierpinski by 34 seconds.

===1984 Olympic Games===
De Castella was the favourite for the 1984 Summer Olympics marathon. He ran in a leading group of ten until about the 35  kilometres mark, when at a drink station, six leading runners picked up speed and de Castella could not keep up. He caught some of the leaders during the final kilometres, and finished fifth.

===1986 Commonwealth Games===
De Castella defended his Commonwealth Games title in Edinburgh, winning in 2:10:15.

==Cross country running==
In addition to marathon running, de Castella was also an accomplished cross country runner. He won the Australian national title once as a junior and four times as a senior, along with five other podium finishes. He competed eight times at the World Cross Country Championships from 1977 to 1986, finishing in the top 20 five times.

==Post career and life==
De Castella failed to finish the marathon at the 1987 World Athletics Championships. He represented Australia at the 1988 Seoul and 1992 Barcelona Olympics, competing in four straight Olympic Games. He finished in the top ten in three Olympics, but never won a medal.

He retired from the sport in 1993 and lives in Canberra, together with his wife Theresa and four children. Previously he was married to the former champion triathlete Gaylene Clews. He lost his family home, along with many of his medals and other citations, in the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Choosing to move rather than rebuild, he now lives in a nearby suburb. He later helped with the taskforce established for the reconstruction of areas worst affected by the fires.

From 1990 to 1995, de Castella was the director of the Australian Institute of Sport and subsequently became executive director of &quot;Focus On You&quot;, a company focusing on corporate and community health and fitness. He has also been actively involved in other organisations dedicated to encouraging healthy living for both children and adults. He also fronts the Indigenous Marathon Project. In 2009, he founded the Stromlo Running Festival, an annual trail running event held at Stromlo Forest Park in Canberra. In 2014 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia at the Australia Day honours.

In 2003, de Castella launched &quot;deeks&quot;, a specialist chain of grain and gluten free bakeries &amp; cafés. In 2004, he earned a black belt in the traditional Okinawan Goju Ryu; he has also been part of a long-running advertising campaign for the multi-vitamin tablet &quot;Centrum&quot;.

On 10 October 2023, de Castella was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

<text>Alexander Stuart &quot;Jock&quot; Sturrock MBE (14 May 1915 in Melbourne11 July 1997 in Noosa Heads) was a noted Australian yachtsman who won over four hundred international, national, state and club championship yachting races.

==Sports career==
Between 1929 and 1959 Jock won 21 Australian and 22 Victorian yachting championships.

He won his first Victorian championship, in the 12 ft Cadet Dinghy &quot;Aurcol&quot;, in 1929 when he was 14 years old.

The first Australian yachting championship he won, in the 12-foot Cadet Dinghy &quot;Monsoon&quot;, was in Perth in 1932 when he was 16 years old. At 18 he helped pioneer the introduction of the International Star class yacht into Australia and then won the first 8 Australian championships held for that Star class (between 1935 and 1947). He was also 6-time Australian 6 Metre class champion (1946, 1947, 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956), 4-time Australian Dragon class champion (1951–52, 1952–53, 1953–54, and 1954–55), and 2-time Australian 5.5 Metre class champion (1956 and 1959).

As an athlete, he represented Australia in four Olympic Games, 1948 London (Star class), 1952 Helsinki (Dragon class), 1956 Melbourne (Bronze Medal, 5.5 Metre class), and 1960 Rome (5.5 Metre class). He was also manager of the Australian Yachting Team for the London and Helsinki Games. At the Rome Olympic Games he became the first athlete to have represented Australia in four Olympic games, and in recognition of that fact was given the honour of being the Australian flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.

Jock first international foray in yachting occurred in 1937, when he was invited to compete in two regattas held by the Royal Yacht Squadron (UK), one at Torbay and the other the Coronation Regatta held at Cowes. At the later he won the Coronation Cup for International 14 ft Dinghies in a boat owned by Sir Fitzroy Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. He also finished in third place in the 1948 World Star Championship held after the London Olympics at Cascais in Portugal, came third in the 1959 European Dragon Championship at Trieste in Italy, and second the 1959 German Dragon Championships at Lake Königssee in Germany.

He achieved international public recognition when he skippered Australia&#x27;s first challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup in &quot;Gretel&quot; in 1962. Although defeated 4 to 1 by &quot;Weatherly&quot;, Gretel&#x27;s victory in the second race was the first by a challenger since 1934, and is widely recognised as the first of the events that resurrected the America&#x27;s Cup as an international sporting competition. He also skippered &quot;Dame Pattie&quot;, Australia&#x27;s second America&#x27;s Cup challenger, in 1967, which was beaten 4–0 by the highly controversial defender &quot;Intrepid&quot;.

He also represented Australia multiple times as an ocean racing skipper in the Admiral&#x27;s Cup (England) and the Clipper Cup (Hawaii), managed two successful Australian campaigns for the International Catamaran Challenge Trophy (the &#x27;Little America&#x27;s Cup&#x27;), and sailed in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race 11 times.

Between 1972 and 1980 he was a member of the Olympic Fund Raising Committee.

Jock Sturrock was recognised as the 1962 Australian of the Year, the 1962 Australian Yachtsman of the Year, and the 1962 Australian Sportsperson of the Year (the Lindy Trophy). In 1975 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to yachting. In 1985 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as an &#x27;Athlete Member&#x27;, and in 1994 was elevated to a &#x27;Legend of Australian Sports&#x27;.

In June 2018 Jock was posthumously recognised by The Australian Sailing Team&#x27;s Alumni Program as the first sailor to represent Australia in an Olympic class boat at an Olympic Games or World Championships and achieve a top 10 performance, by the awarding of the No.1 Barranjoey Medal. In October 2018 he was inducted into the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame.

==Military service==

Jock served in the 46th Battalion of the Australian Army from 1940 to 1945, rising in rank from private to captain within his first two years.

In February 1942 he was seconded as a liaison officer to HQ 3rd Division 2AIF, and subsequently trained for long-range specialist reconnaissance, intelligence gathering and sabotage behind enemy lines. In December 1943 was appointed adjutant to LHQ Tactical School (Jungle Warfare) on Rainy Mountain near Kuranda in Queensland.

During 1943 and 1944 he saw active service in Papua New Guinea on three separate occasions, serving as an intelligence officer with both HQ New Guinea Force and HQ 3rd Division 2AIF during the war against the Japanese 51st Division at the Battle of Wau and the Salamaua–Lae campaign. His duty was the gathering of intelligence from outlying spotter posts behind enemy lines, and carrying orders and intelligence back and forth along the Black Cat Track and the Buisaval Track between front-line troops and HQ. It also included a 6-week period in July/August 1943 when he was promoted in the field to Major and traversed the Bitoi River Track with a native carrier to act as Senior Liaison Officer with the United States Army&#x27;s 41st Division 162nd Regiment at Nassau Bay.

As the direct result of his army service, Jock was hospitalised on five occasions: once for a broken ankle during training in Queensland, and in PNG twice for Dengue Fever, once for a concussion received when a US reconnaissance plane he was in crashed in the jungle between Nassau Bay and Wau, and finally for a broken leg received when a suspension bridge over the Bitoi River collapsed during a night-time crossing. This last event lead to him being invalided out of active service and returning to Melbourne, and affected his mobility for the rest of his life.

==Other tributes==

Tributes to Jock include streets named after him: &#x27;Sturrock Place&#x27; in the Canberra suburb of Gordon, and 3 &#x27;Sturrock Courts&#x27; in the Melbourne suburbs of Berwick, Mill Park and Altona Meadows; and the &#x27;Jock Sturrock Bridge&#x27; in Noosaville, Queensland.

<text>Harry Elkins Widener (January 3, 1885 – April 15, 1912) was an American businessman and bibliophile, and a member of the Widener family. His mother built Harvard University&#x27;s Widener Memorial Library in his memory, after his death on the foundering of the .

==Early life and education==


Widener was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of George Dunton Widener (1861–1912) and Eleanor Elkins Widener, and the grandson of entrepreneur Peter A. B. Widener (1834–1915). He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Harvard College in 1907, where he was a member of Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Owl Club. Widener&#x27;s godfather was the British banking magnate, Charles Mills, the 2nd Baron Hillingdon.

==Book collecting==
Widener was a member of the Grolier Club.

Book collector and dealer George Sidney Hellman, following Widener&#x27;s death, said, 

==&quot;Titanic&quot; sinking==
Along with his parents, in April 1912 Widener boarded the &quot;Titanic&quot; at Cherbourg, France bound for New York City. As the ship sank Widener&#x27;s mother and her maid were rescued, but Widener, his father, and his father&#x27;s valet perished. In 1915, Widener&#x27;s mother donated the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library to Harvard in his memory. Two buildings at the Hill School are also dedicated to Widener, and stained glass windows at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, are dedicated to Widener and his father.

A Harvard legend holds that in order to spare others her son&#x27;s fate, Widener&#x27;s mother insisted, as a condition of her gift, that future Harvard graduates be required to learn to swim. However, while Harvard implemented a swimming test in the 1920s, which it later dropped, the policy was unrelated to Widener.

<doc id="1131311" wikidata="Q5237734" url="?curid=1131311" title="Killing of David Morley">
<text>David Roger Morley (3 October 1967 – 30 October 2004) was a barman who was fatally attacked by a group of youths near Waterloo station in London on the morning of 30 October 2004. The attack garnered widespread media coverage as a fatality of a violent trend known as happy slapping and due to the belief that the attack was motivated by homophobia.

In December 2005, four youths were found guilty of Morley&#x27;s manslaughter. A fifteen-year-old girl, Chelsea O&#x27;Mahoney (aged fourteen at the time of the incident) was sentenced to an 8-year custodial sentence. Her co-defendants Reece Sargeant (21), Darren Case (18) and David Blenman (17), all from Kennington, South London, were sentenced to 12 years each. They had been prosecuted for murder, but the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter as they are permitted to do.

==Background==
Morley was known in the gay community of London as &quot;Cinders&quot;. He was a manager at the Admiral Duncan pub when it was the target of a nail bomb attack in 1999 as part of the attacks against London&#x27;s minorities by David Copeland. Morley suffered burns during the attack. Friends of Morley said he spent the weeks following the attack visiting and comforting those who had been more seriously injured in hospital. At the time of his death, he was working at another gay bar, Bromptons, in Earls Court.

==Attack==
The attack on Morley was one of eight that the group carried out in the early hours of 30 October, but they had decided amongst themselves that they would attack people on the evening of 29 October. A 15-year-old associate of the group told police they planned to beat up &quot;tramps, druggies or just people on the street.&quot; Morley was the sole fatality. The attacks were carried out between 2.30am and 3.20am.

At 3.10am the group encountered Morley and his friend Alastair Whiteside sitting on a bench near London&#x27;s Hungerford Bridge. O&#x27;Mahoney told Morley they were making a documentary on happy slapping and to &quot;pose for the camera&quot;. They proceeded to attack the pair and stole Whiteside&#x27;s mobile phone. After stealing the phone they continued to attack Morley and Whiteside. Whiteside&#x27;s witness testimony stated that the girl, O&#x27;Mahoney, finished Morley off by kicking him two or three times in the head, &quot;like a football.&quot; After this attack the group continued to assault others three more times.

Morley was taken to St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Lambeth, where he was operated on, but was pronounced dead at 7.40pm. A post-mortem found he had suffered 44 injuries, including five fractured ribs. He died of a hemorrhage from a ruptured spleen and fractured ribs. The pathologist said the injuries were more consistent with those seen after a car accident or someone who had fallen from a great height.

No CCTV images saw O&#x27;Mahoney film the attack on Morley (as is the case with happy slap attacks) however she appears to be doing so in CCTV images of the final attack of the night against a homeless man, Wayne Miller. An extensive forensic investigation failed to find pictures or videos of the attacks on any of the assailants&#x27; mobile phones.

On 23 January 2006 Sargeant, Case and Blenman were sentenced to twelve years in prison and O&#x27;Mahoney to eight years. O&#x27;Mahoney had been described as a &quot;child of heroin addicts&quot; with a &quot;particularly chaotic and fragmented life&quot;. The other members of the gang were described as &quot;immature and vulnerable to peer pressure&quot;.

==Memorial==
Over 1,000 people attended a vigil in commemoration of Morley&#x27;s life at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho on 5 November 2004. Speeches were given by his friends, and one on behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley&#x27;s friend said, &quot;This is the second time he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but for all of us here today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts.&quot; Livingstone said, &quot;David Morley was well known and well loved in London&#x27;s lesbian and gay community.&quot;

<text>Sir Bernard Thomas Heinze, AC, FRCM (1 July 189410 June 1982) was an Australian conductor, academic, and Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music.

He conducted all the orchestras run by the ABC, most particularly the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, of which he was chief conductor from 1933 to 1950. Also, he was chief conductor of the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic from 1927, becoming Honorary Life Conductor in the 1960s, and continuing his association with the RMP until 1978.

In addition he was guest conductor of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra in 1939. Discouraged by Australian audiences&#x27; lack of interest in music, he founded Children&#x27;s Concerts. He also initiated the Young Performers Awards, which continue to showcase emerging international talent.

He introduced Australian audiences to the works of Anton Bruckner, Dmitri Shostakovich, Béla Bartók and William Walton, and promoted Australian composers. In 1949 he became the first Australian ever to be knighted for services to music. Through teaching and performance, not least via broadcasting, he played a central role in his country&#x27;s artistic activities. In his later years he was, quite simply, the most influential single man in Australian music, one critic having declared: &#x27;there is not a fibre of our musical life that has not been modified by his career.&#x27;

==Biography==

Bernard Heinze was born in Shepparton, Victoria on 1 July 1894, the son of Benjamin Heinze, a German-born watch-maker and jeweller, and his Yorkshire-born wife, Minnie Heinze, née Greenwell. Educated at St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic College, Ballarat, Heinze received violin lessons at an early age, under the guidance of Walter Gude (1904–12) first in Ballarat, and later at the University of Melbourne under Franklin Peterson, before being awarded the (Sir William) Clarke Scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London (1913).

World War I interrupted Heinze&#x27;s studies and his career was put on hold; he received a commission in May 1916 with the British Royal Garrison Artillery Special Reserve Regiment and fought at Arras, Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele.

With the advent of peace, Heinze studied in Paris at the Schola Cantorum, under Vincent d&#x27;Indy. He returned home in 1923. When only 32 years old, he succeeded William Laver as Ormond Professor of Music at the University of Melbourne. He held this professorship till 1957, and played a crucial role in the creation of the Faculty of Music. Thus he influenced governmental education policy for the successful introduction of music to the state curriculum.

One of Heinze&#x27;s great achievements came with the advent of wireless radio. As director-general of music with the new National Broadcasting Service at 3LO-3AR (forerunner to the ABC), he was able to inspire a generation of Australians to the love of orchestral music that was until then largely a luxury confined to the upper classes.

Heinze envisaged a central professional full-time orchestra in Melbourne. After Alberto Zelman&#x27;s death in 1927, he was offered the conductorship of the Melbourne Philharmonic Society (later the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic); many of the players of the RMP&#x27;s orchestra also played in Fritz Hart&#x27;s Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. This led to the loss of the RMP Orchestra&#x27;s separate identity. From 1932 to 1937, Heinze was co-chief conductor of the MSO with Hart, and sole chief conductor until 1950. The MSO was renamed the Victorian Symphony Orchestra in 1949, reverting to its original name in 1964.

In 1929 Heinze was appointed music adviser to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. There he oversaw the inception of its State orchestras, celebrity concerts, youth concerts and fine music broadcasting.

His last appointment of significance was as director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music (1956–66) succeeding Sir Eugene Goossens, who had resigned in scandal. After leaving the directorship in 1966, Heinze continued to conduct the main Australian orchestras on a regular basis until the late 1970s. He also conducted overseas orchestras: on 14 January 1947, he was the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in the professional concerto debut of the 14-year-old Glenn Gould, who played Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4.

He died on 10 June 1982, aged 87, in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, survived by his wife Valerie née Hennessy.

==Honours==
Bernard Heinze became a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1931.

He was knighted in 1949, the first Australian musician to receive this honour.

Sir Bernard was named the 1974 Australian of the Year.

On Australia Day 1976, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian music.

==Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award==
The Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award was inaugurated following the death of Sir Bernard Heinze in 1982, and is given annually to a person who has made an outstanding contribution to music in Australia.

<doc id="1131323" wikidata="Q3205406" url="?curid=1131323" title="The Dagger of Kamui">
<text>is a Japanese novel series by Tetsu Yano released by Kadokawa Shoten from 1984 to 1985.

The series was adapted in 1985 into an anime film directed by Rintaro and animated by Madhouse. The screenplay was adapted by Mori Masaki, and character designs were created by Moribi Murano, who also illustrated the novel series. Takuo Noda directed the animation, and the music was composed by Ryūdō Uzaki and Eitetsu Hayashi.

The story begins during the Bakumatsu period of Japan in the last years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It continues through the pre-Meiji period and refers to historical events such as the Boshin War, including the involvement of foreign governments, the Naval Battle of Hakodate, and the Meiji Restoration. There are also references to historical figures such as Captain Kidd, Saigō Takamori, Andō Shōzan, Oguri Kozukenosuke (Tadamasa), Geronimo, and Mark Twain.

==Plot==
Jirō, a young boy of Japanese and Ainu descent, is a foundling raised by a kindly innkeeper and her daughter in the village of Sai on the Shimokita Peninsula.

One evening, a shinobi kills Jirō&#x27;s adoptive mother and sister while he is away. When he returns home, he finds their bodies and a strange dagger. The angry villagers accuse him of the murders, and rather than face a brutal crucifixion for the grave crime of parricide, Jirō escapes with the dagger. He encounters a Buddhist monk called Tenkai, who works for the Shogunate as an Oniwaban (Secret Police). Tenkai takes the boy to confront the man who supposedly killed his family and provokes him into delivering the killing blow. To cover his tracks, Tenkai has the village set ablaze, and the villagers are slaughtered. Tenkai takes Jirō to his temple on the island of Ezo, and has his subordinates Shingo and Sanpei train him in the ways of the Ninja. Years later, Jirō leaves to find answers to the mystery of his family and his father, Tarōza. Meanwhile, Tenkai has him followed.

Jirō comes across a group of Japanese men beating up an old Ainu man, and he quickly dispatches them. The old man dies of his injuries, but his son Uraka takes Jirō to his home village of Shinopirika-Kotan, unaware the old man&#x27;s assailants are agents of Tenkai. At Kotan, the village elder recognizes Jirō&#x27;s dagger as the Dagger of Kamui, which was originally owned by a former village chieftain. It was given to a Japanese ninja who married the chieftain&#x27;s daughter, Oyaruru. Years later, Oyaruru returned to Kotan alone, but eventually left the village to live upriver by herself.

Jirō finds Oyaruru and learns she is his biological mother. She reveals that Tenkai dispatched Tarōza to the mountain Kamui Nupuri to find a rumored treasure large enough to keep the Shogunate in power. However, Tarōza broke all contact with Tenkai and married Oyaruru. When Tenkai caught up with them, he slashed the face of the infant Jirō and sent him floating downriver in their canoe. Tarōza fought Tenkai&#x27;s men on the cliff above, but lost an eye to a primitive grenade and his sword arm to Hanzou, then appeared to fall to his death. Jirō comes to the horrifying realization that Tenkai had tricked him, and that the man he stabbed was his father. During their evening meal, Jirō and Oyaruru collapse from a paralysis potion supplied by Shingo, and Oyaruru is killed by Shingo with the Dagger of Kamui. Implicated in her murder, Jirō is imprisoned, but Uraka returns to help free him. Jirō finally realizes that Tenkai has been manipulating him for years into following his father&#x27;s footsteps, searching for the treasure, and plans his revenge against Tenkai.

Traveling north, Jirō is befriended by the elderly Andō Shōzan and a young Ainu girl. She helps find secret instructions to find a great treasure which is hidden with the hilt of the sword of Kamui. However, Jirō is tracked down by three of Tenkai&#x27;s formidable assassins, whom he defeats, but not before they kill Shouzan. The Ainu girl helps Jirō escape, but she kills herself when confronted by the following Tenkai. With the aid of the sailor Sam, Jirō books passage on Captain Drasnic&#x27;s ship to the United States. Onboard, he is attacked by Oyuki, one of Tenkai&#x27;s shinobi, but he defeats her. He then saves her from drowning, and they develop a strong bond. After arriving in America, Jirō, Sam, and Oyuki become separated, and Jirō travels on alone. Jirō befriends Chico, a French-born Indian woman, and shelters with her tribe. He then encounters Mark Twain on the way the Los Angeles, heading for the island of Santa Catalina, which is apparently the location of Captain Kidd&#x27;s treasure.

Jirō eventually finds a small treasure on the island, but Tenkai and his shinobi have followed him there with Oyuki. Tenkai suddenly reveals that Sanpei is a Satsuma and an associate of Tarōza, who was also Oyuki&#x27;s father, making her Jirō&#x27;s half sister. Oyuki angrily stabs Tenkai through the heart with the dagger, although he manages to fatally wound her before he dies. Jirō then finds the real treasure below in a hidden cavern. Later, Chico reappears and shows Jirō a similar copy of the treasure&#x27;s location. She reveals her real name is Julie Rochelle, the daughter of French spies also seeking the treasure, and that her father and Tenkai killed each other. Jirō now realizes that Tenkai has been using body doubles. He returns to Japan, where he uses Captain Kidd&#x27;s treasure to help fund the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate by the combined Satsuma-Choushuu forces.

In 1869, at the Citadel of Hakodate, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army closed in on the last remaining Shogunate rebels. After a massive naval bombardment, Jirō wanders through the rubble and bodies, eventually encountering Tenkai. They engage in battle, during which Jirō kills Tenkai by impaling him through his cranium with the dagger. Jirō leaves Hakodate as the Imperial forces capture the city, but not before paying a silent farewell to Sanpei and his master, the samurai Saigō Takamori.

<doc id="1131331" wikidata="Q7233190" url="?curid=1131331" title="Position error">
<text>Position error is one of the errors affecting the systems in an aircraft for measuring airspeed and altitude. It is not practical or necessary for an aircraft to have an airspeed indicating system and an altitude indicating system that are exactly accurate. A small amount of error is tolerable. It is caused by the location of the static vent that supplies air pressure to the airspeed indicator and altimeter; there is no position on an aircraft where, at all angles of attack, the static pressure is always equal to atmospheric pressure.

== Static system ==

All aircraft are equipped with a small hole in the surface of the aircraft called the static port. The air pressure in the vicinity of the static port is conveyed by a conduit to the altimeter and the airspeed indicator. This static port and the conduit constitute the aircraft&#x27;s static system. The objective of the static system is to sense the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. In an ideal static system the air pressure fed to the altimeter and airspeed indicator is equal to the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.

As the air flows past an aircraft in flight, the streamlines are affected by the presence of the aircraft, and the speed of the air relative to the aircraft is different at different positions on the aircraft&#x27;s outer surface. In consequence of Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, the different speeds of the air result in different pressures at different positions on the aircraft&#x27;s surface. The ideal position for a static port is a position where the local air pressure in flight is always equal to the pressure remote from the aircraft, however there is no position on an aircraft where this ideal situation exists for all angles of attack. When deciding on a position for a static port, aircraft designers attempt to find a position where the error between static pressure and free-stream pressure is a minimum across the operating range of angle of attack of the aircraft. The residual error at any given angle of attack is called the position error.

Position error affects the indicated airspeed and the indicated altitude. Aircraft manufacturers use the aircraft flight manual to publish details of the error in indicated airspeed and indicated altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and equivalent airspeed.

== Pitot system ==

Bernoulli&#x27;s principle states that total pressure (or stagnation pressure) is constant along a streamline. There is no variation in stagnation pressure, regardless of the position on the streamline where it is measured. There is no position error associated with stagnation pressure.

The pitot tube supplies pressure to the airspeed indicator. Pitot pressure is equal to stagnation pressure providing the pitot tube is aligned with the local airflow, it is located outside the boundary layer, and outside the wash from the propeller. Pitot pressure can suffer alignment error but it is not vulnerable to position error.

== Aircraft design standards ==

Aircraft design standards specify a maximum amount of Pitot-static system error. The error in indicated altitude must not be excessive because it is important for pilots to know their altitude with reasonable accuracy for the purpose of traffic separation. US Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23, §23.1325(e) includes the following requirement for the static pressure system:
*The system error, in indicated pressure altitude, ..., may not exceed ± per speed for the [operating speed range for the aircraft].

The error in indicated airspeed must also not be excessive. Part 23, §23.1323(b) includes the following requirement for the airspeed indicating system:
*The system error, including position error, ..., may not exceed three percent of the calibrated airspeed or , whichever is greater, throughout the [operating speed range for the aircraft].

== Measuring position error ==

For the purpose of complying with an aircraft design standard that specifies a maximum permissible error in the airspeed indicating system it is necessary to measure the position error in a representative aircraft. There are many different methods for measuring position error. Some of the more common methods are:
* use of a GNSS receiver while flying a triangular course
* trailing conduit with static source, stabilized by a plastic cone
* tower fly-by with photographs of the passing aircraft taken from the tower to accurately show the height of the aircraft above or below the tower
* trailing bob with both Pitot and static sources

<text>Edward William Garnett (5 January 1868 – 19 February 1937) was an English writer, critic and literary editor, who was instrumental in the publication of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Edward Garnett was born in London. His father, Richard Garnett (1835–1906), was a writer and librarian at the British Museum. On 31 August 1889 Edward married Constance Black, known for her translations of Russian literature; the writer David Garnett (1892–1981) was their son.

==Career==
Garnett had only a few years&#x27; formal education at the City of London School, leaving at the age of 16, but he educated himself further by reading widely. He gained a high reputation at the time for a mixture of good sense and sensitivity in relation to contemporary literature. His influence through his encouragement of leading authors exceeded by far that of his own writing. His literary contacts and correspondents spread far and wide, from Peter Kropotkin to Edward Thomas.

He worked as an editor and reader for the London publishing houses of T. Fisher Unwin, Gerald Duckworth and Company, and then Jonathan Cape. He brought together in 1898 Joseph Conrad, an Unwin author to whom he acted as a mentor as well as a friend, and Ford Madox Ford; they collaborated in the first few years of the twentieth century. Garnett befriended D. H. Lawrence, and for a time influenced him in the direction of realist fiction. In preparing &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; for publication by Duckworth, Garnett went through the manuscript, censoring some passages and cutting others until the novel was ten per cent shorter; he did not negotiate these changes with Lawrence, but sent the manuscript direct to the printers. The changes including replacing ′hips′ with ′body′ and ′thighs′ with ′limbs.′ He removed the word ′natural′ from ′He could smell her faint natural perfume.′″ Lawrence accepted the changes, saying ″It&#x27;s got to sell, I&#x27;ve got to live.″

Garnett also had a role in getting T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s work published. One of his oversights was to turn down for Duckworth James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, in 1915. He was a strong supporter of John Galsworthy, and &quot;The Man of Property&quot; in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; was dedicated to him. He also championed American writers Stephen Crane and Robert Frost and Australia&#x27;s Henry Lawson, and helped the Irish writer Liam O&#x27;Flaherty.

His play &quot;The Breaking Point&quot; was not allowed a licence for dramatic performance in London under the censorship system of the time (Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office). Its publication was permitted, and in 1907 Garnett published the play, which dealt with an unmarried mother, together with an open letter to the censor. The letter was in fact written by the critic William Archer. This was one battle in a campaign being waged at the time, under the leadership of Bernard Shaw, to free the stage.

Garnett lived at The Cearne, Crockham Hill, near Edenbridge in Kent. His London address was 19, Pond Place, Chelsea.

<text>Over-Nite Sensation is the twelfth album by The Mothers of Invention (credited as The Mothers), and the seventeenth album overall by Frank Zappa, released in September 1973. It was Zappa&#x27;s first album released on his DiscReet label.

== Recording ==
Frank Zappa wanted to use backup singers on the songs &quot;I&#x27;m the Slime&quot;, &quot;Dirty Love&quot;, &quot;Zomby Woof&quot;, &quot;Dinah-Moe Humm&quot; and &quot;Montana&quot;. His road manager suggested The Ikettes, and Ike &amp; Tina Turner were contacted. Ike Turner insisted that Zappa pay the singers, including Tina Turner, no more than $25 per song (). However, an invoice shows that they were actually paid $25 per hour, and in total $187.50 each for hours of work (). During the recording sessions at Bolic Sound, Tina brought Ike into the studio to hear the highly difficult middle section of &quot;Montana&quot; which had taken the Ikettes a few days to learn and master. Ike listened to the tape and responded &quot;What is this shit?&quot; before leaving the studio. Ike later insisted that Zappa not credit the Ikettes on the released album. Zappa confirmed in 1973 that Tina and the Ikettes did appear on the record even though he was &quot;not supposed&quot; to say so.

The recording sessions which produced &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; also produced Zappa&#x27;s followup, &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; (1974), released as a solo album rather than a Mothers of Invention release.

== Music and lyrics ==
Much of the album&#x27;s lyrics deal with sex. For example, &quot;Dinah-Moe Humm&quot; describes a woman who wagers that the narrator can&#x27;t give her an orgasm and is ultimately aroused by watching him have sex with her sister.

On other topics, &quot;I&#x27;m the Slime&quot; criticizes television, and the playful and musically adventurous &quot;Montana&quot; describes moving to Montana to grow dental floss.

The music of &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; draws from rock, jazz and pop music. &quot;Zomby Woof&quot; has been described as a &quot;heavy metal hybrid of Louis Jordan and Fats Waller&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover was done by Dave McMacken as somewhat in the vein of Salvador Dalí&#x27;s surreal imagery depicting a two-headed man sitting on a waterbed in a Holiday Inn hotel room surrounded by various objects like a Mothers backstage pass and a television set showing Zappa&#x27;s face with slime oozing out of it. The entire painting is depicted in a frame showing many sexual acts.

== Reception ==
The album initially received mixed reviews due to its lyrical content, which some critics found puerile. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine disliked the album, describing Zappa as a &quot;spent force&quot;, and saying that his best work had been recorded with earlier incarnations of the Mothers. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; said that the album was &quot;not one of Frank&#x27;s most outstanding efforts.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a C, mocking the notion that Zappa&#x27;s humor underscores serious commentary by asking &quot;where&#x27;s the serious stuff?&quot;

Later reviews evaluated the album far better, with AllMusic writer Steve Huey writing, &quot;Love it or hate it, &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; was a watershed album for Frank Zappa, the point where his post-&#x27;60s aesthetic was truly established&quot;. Kelly Fisher Lowe, in &quot;The Words and Music of Frank Zappa&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Over-Nite&quot; and &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; are important [...] as a return to Mothers of Invention form and as close to traditional pop albums as Zappa would ever come.&quot;

The record was certified gold on November 9, 1976.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; (1973) and &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; (1974) are the subject of a &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series documentary from Eagle Rock Entertainment, released on DVD May 1, 2007.

The lines &quot;She was buns-up kneelin&#x27; / Buns up! / I was wheelin an&#x27; dealin&#x27;&quot; from &quot;Dinah-Moe Humm&quot; are quoted (as &quot;So there she was / buns up and kneelin&#x27; / I was wheelin&#x27; and a-dealin&#x27;&quot;) in &quot;Girl Keeps Coming Apart&quot;, on Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;. Zappa is credited in the liner notes.

<doc id="1131348" wikidata="Q871923" url="?curid=1131348" title="Bencode">
<text>Bencode (pronounced like &quot;Bee-encode&quot;) is the encoding used by the peer-to-peer file sharing system BitTorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured data.

It supports four different types of values:
* byte strings,
* integers,
* lists, and
* dictionaries (associative arrays).

Bencoding is most commonly used in torrent files, and as such is part of the BitTorrent specification. These metadata files are simply bencoded dictionaries.

Bencoding is simple and (because numbers are encoded as text in decimal notation) is unaffected by endianness, which is important for a cross-platform application like BitTorrent. It is also fairly flexible, as long as applications ignore unexpected dictionary keys, so that new ones can be added without creating incompatibilities.

== Encoding Algorithm ==

Bencode uses ASCII characters as delimiters and digits to encode data structures in a simple and compact format.

* Integers are encoded as codice_1.
** The integer is encoded in base 10 and may be negative (indicated by a leading hyphen-minus).
** Leading zeros are not allowed unless the integer is zero.
** Examples:
*** Zero is encoded as codice_2.
*** The number 42 is encoded as codice_3.
*** Negative forty-two is encoded as codice_4.

* Byte Strings are encoded as codice_5.
** The length is the number of bytes in the string, encoded in base 10.
** A colon (codice_6) separates the length and the contents.
** The contents are the exact number of bytes specified by the length.
** Examples:
*** An empty string is encoded as codice_7.
*** The string &quot;bencode&quot; is encoded as codice_8.

* Lists are encoded as codice_9.
** Begins with codice_10 and ends with codice_11.
** Elements are bencoded values concatenated without delimiters.
** Examples:
*** An empty list is encoded as codice_12.
*** A list containing the string &quot;bencode&quot; and the integer -20 is encoded as codice_13.

* Dictionaries are encoded as codice_14.
** Begins with codice_15 and ends with codice_11.
** Contains key-value pairs.
** Keys are byte strings and must appear in lexicographical order.
** Each key is immediately followed by its value, which can be any bencoded type.
** Examples:
*** An empty dictionary is encoded as codice_17.
*** A dictionary with keys &quot;wiki&quot; → &quot;bencode&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot; → 42 is encoded as codice_18.

There are no restrictions on the types of values stored within lists and dictionaries; they may contain other lists and dictionaries, allowing for arbitrarily complex data structures.

=== Types of Errors in Bencode ===

Here is the list of the possible errors that a ill-formatted bencode may have:

# Null root value.
# Non-singular root item.
# Invalid type encountered (character not &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, or &#x27;0&#x27;-&#x27;9&#x27;).
# Missing &#x27;e&#x27; terminator for &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;, or &#x27;d&#x27; types.
# Integer errors:
## Contains non-digit characters.
## Has a leading zero.
## Is negative zero.
# Byte String errors:
## Negative length.
## Length not followed by &#x27;:&#x27;.
## Unexpected EOF before completing string.
# Dictionary errors:
## Key is not a string.
## Duplicate keys.
## Keys not sorted.
## Missing value for a key.

==Features==
Bencode is a very specialized kind of binary coding with some unique properties:

* For each possible (complex) value, there is only a single valid bencoding; i.e. there is a bijection between values and their encodings. This has the advantage that applications may compare bencoded values by comparing their encoded forms, eliminating the need to decode the values.
* Bencoding serves similar purposes as data languages like JSON and YAML, allowing complex yet loosely structured data to be stored in a platform independent way. This allowing a linear memory storage for complex data.

== Drawbacks ==

* Many BE codegroups can be decoded manually. Since the bencoded values often contain binary data, decoding may become quite complex. Bencode is not considered a human-readable encoding format.
* The specification deals with encoding characters in the ASCII set only leaving the solution to users. This brings about several solutions and less conformity.

However, this uniqueness can cause some problems:

* There are very few bencode editors
* Because bencoded files contain binary data, and because of some of the intricacies involved in the way binary strings are typically stored, it is often not safe to edit bencode files in text editors.

<text>The Czartoryski coat of arms is a Polish–Lithuanian coat of arms, a variant of the Pogoń Litewska arms. It has been used by the Gediminid Czartoryski family.

==History==
The Czartoryski family is of Lithuanian descent from Ruthenia. Their ancestor, a grandson of Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, became known with his baptismal name Constantine (c. 1330−1390) - he became a Prince of Chortoryisk in Volhynia. One of his sons, Vasyli Chortoryiski (Ukrainian: Чарторийський; c. 1375–1416), was granted an estate in Volhynia in 1393, and his three sons John, Alexander and Michael (c. 1400–1489) are considered the progenitors of the family. The founding members were culturally Ruthenian and Eastern Orthodox; they converted to Roman Catholicism and were Polonized during the 16th century.

Michael&#x27;s descendant Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski (1674–1741), Duke of Klewan and Zukow (Klevan and Zhukiv), Castellan of Vilnius, reawakened Czartoryski royal ambitions at the end of the 17th century. He married Isabella Morsztyn, daughter of the Grand Treasurer of Poland, and built &quot;The Familia&quot; with their four children, Michał, August, Teodor and Konstancja. The family became known and powerful under the lead of brothers Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski and August Aleksander Czartoryski in the late Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of the 18th century, during the reigns Augustus II the Strong (King of Poland, 1697–1706 and 1709–1733) and Stanisław I Leszczyński (King of Poland 1704–1709 and 1733–1736). The Czartoryski had risen to power under August Aleksander Czartoryski (1697–1782) of the Klewa line, who married Zofia Denhoffowa, the only heir to the Sieniawski family.

The family attained the height of its influence from the mid-18th century in the court of King Augustus III (r. 1734–1763). The Czartoryski brothers gained a very powerful ally in their brother-in-law, Stanisław Poniatowski, whose son became the last king of the independent Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanisław August Poniatowski (r. 1764–1795).

The Czartoryski&#x27;s Familia saw the decline of the Commonwealth and the rise of anarchy and joined the camp which was determined to press ahead with reforms; thus they sought the enactment of such constitutional reforms as the abolition of the liberum veto.

Although the Russian Empire confiscated the family estate at Puławy in 1794, during the third partition of Poland, the Familia continued to wield significant cultural and political influence for decades after, notably through the princes Adam Kazimierz (1734–1823), Adam Jerzy (1770–1861) and Konstanty Adam (1777–1866).

The Czartoryski family is renowned for the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków and the Hôtel Lambert in Paris.

Today, the only descendants of Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski are Prince Adam Karol Czartoryski (1940- ) and his daughter Tamara Czartoryska (1978- ), who live in the United Kingdom. The descendants of Prince Konstanty Adam Czartoryski live to this day in Poland and have their representatives in the Confederation of the Polish Nobility.

Coat of arms and motto
The Czartoryski family used the Czartoryski coat of arms and the motto Bądź co bądź (&quot;Come what may&quot;, literally &#x27;let be, that which will be&#x27;). The family&#x27;s arms were a modification of the Pogoń Litewska arms.

<doc id="1131357" wikidata="Q7239206" url="?curid=1131357" title="Preclinical development">
<text>In drug development, preclinical development (also termed preclinical studies or nonclinical studies) is a stage of research that begins before clinical trials (testing in humans) and during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, typically in laboratory animals.

The main goals of preclinical studies are to determine a starting, safe dose for first-in-human study and assess potential toxicity of the product, which typically include new medical devices, prescription drugs, and diagnostics.

Companies use stylized statistics to illustrate the risks in preclinical research, such as that on average, only one in every 5,000 compounds that enters drug discovery to the stage of preclinical development becomes an approved drug. 

==Types of preclinical research==
Each class of product may undergo different types of preclinical research. For instance, drugs may undergo pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) (PD), pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) (PK), ADME, and toxicology testing. This data allows researchers to allometrically estimate a safe starting dose of the drug for clinical trials in humans. Medical devices that do not have drug attached will not undergo these additional tests and may go directly to good laboratory practices (GLP) testing for safety of the device and its components. Some medical devices will also undergo biocompatibility testing which helps to show whether a component of the device or all components are sustainable in a living model. Most preclinical studies must adhere to GLPs in ICH Guidelines to be acceptable for submission to regulatory agencies such as the Food &amp; Drug Administration in the United States.

Typically, both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; tests will be performed. Studies of drug toxicity include which organs are targeted by that drug, as well as if there are any long-term carcinogenic effects or toxic effects causing illness.

==Animal testing==
The information collected from these studies is vital so that safe human testing can begin. Typically, in drug development studies animal testing involves two species. The most commonly used models are murine and canine, although primate and porcine are also used.

===Choice of species===
The choice of species is based on which will give the best correlation to human trials. Differences in the gut, enzyme activity, circulatory system, or other considerations make certain models more appropriate based on the dosage form, site of activity, or noxious metabolites. For example, canines may not be good models for solid oral dosage forms because the characteristic carnivore intestine is underdeveloped compared to the omnivore&#x27;s, and gastric emptying rates are increased. Also, rodents can not act as models for antibiotic drugs because the resulting alteration to their intestinal flora causes significant adverse effects. Depending on a drug&#x27;s functional groups, it may be metabolized in similar or different ways between species, which will affect both efficacy and toxicology.

Medical device studies also use this basic premise. Most studies are performed in larger species such as dogs, pigs and sheep which allow for testing in a similar sized model as that of a human. In addition, some species are used for similarity in specific organs or organ system physiology (swine for dermatological and coronary stent studies; goats for mammary implant studies; dogs for gastric and cancer studies; etc.).

Importantly, the regulatory guidelines of FDA, EMA, and other similar international and regional authorities usually require safety testing in at least two mammalian species, including one non-rodent species, prior to human trials authorization.

===Ethical issues===
Animal testing in the research-based pharmaceutical industry has been reduced in recent years both for ethical and cost reasons. However, most research will still involve animal based testing for the need of similarity in anatomy and physiology that is required for diverse product development.

==No observable effect levels==
Based on preclinical trials, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) on drugs are established, which are used to determine initial phase 1 clinical trial dosage levels on a mass API per mass patient basis. Generally a 1/100 uncertainty factor or &quot;safety margin&quot; is included to account for interspecies (1/10) and inter-individual (1/10) differences.

<text>Arak (; ) is a city in the Central District of Arak County, Markazi province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district.

The city is nicknamed the &quot;Industrial Capital of Iran&quot;. As a major industrial city, Arak hosts several industrial factories inside and within a few kilometers outside the city, including the factory of Machine Sazi Arak and the Iranian Aluminium Company. These factories produce nearly half of the needs of the country in the steel, petrochemical, and locomotive industries.

==Etymology==
===Arâk===
The term &quot;Arâk&quot; remains from a name given to the region since the medieval period. It derives from Arabic &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;root&quot;, itself derived possibly from Akkadian &quot;Uruk&quot; (, &quot;Erech&quot;). But new research has shown that the word Arak has the same roots with the words Iran and Arran, and the name Iraq is an Arabicized Persian word.

During the Seljuk era, a region comprising the whole territory of Media (northwestern Iran) and the lower part of Mesopotamia was referred to as &quot;Iraq&quot;; with the Median part called &quot;ʿErâq-e ʿAjam&quot; (&quot;Iraq of the Ajam [non-Arabic speakers]&quot;), and the Mesopotamian part called &quot;ʿErâq-e ʿArab&quot; (&quot;Iraq of the Arab&quot;).

===Soltân Âbâd===
The term &quot;Soltân Âbâd&quot; is a Persian compound word.

&quot;Soltân&quot;, deriving from Arabic &quot;&quot; (&quot;power&quot;, &quot;authority&quot;), is a Near Eastern noble title given to a powerful governor. Modern Persian &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;settlement&quot; or &quot;abode&quot;, derives from Middle Persian &quot;&quot; (&quot;populous&quot;). However, according to linguist Sasha Lubotsky, the Persian term &quot;ābād&quot; might derive from Proto-Iranian &quot;*āpāta&quot; (&quot;protected&quot;), rooting from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot; (&quot;to protect&quot;).

==History==

Originally named &quot;Soltan Abad&quot;, the modern-day city of Arak was founded in 1808 by Yusef Khan-e Gorji, a pro-Iranian warlord of Georgian Muslim origin who was given refuge by Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan following a territorial dispute with his cousins, who were supported by Russian empress Catherine the Great.

Between 1795 and 1797, Yusef Khan-e Gorji, renamed &quot;Yusef Khan-e Sepahdar&quot; by the Qajar ruler, settled his army in the fertile but poorly-controlled territory that would become the modern-day Arak. Hostile tribes in the region had operated autonomously from the Qajar rule. With the Shah&#x27;s approval, Yusef Khan diverted the main river to drive out the hostiles and build the war fortress of Soltan Abad to act as a buffer.

According to early modern historians, Yusef Khan built the city with the aid of effluents. Until 1892, the town remained a military base and fortress. The fortress of Soltan Abad had a thick wall surrounded by 7-meter-deep moats. Eight towers were constructed around the town and the governmental building was established in its northern part.

In 1891, shops, gardens, and government buildings of Soltan Abad were repaired by the order of deputy governor Mirza Hasan (&quot;Etemad os-Saltane&quot;). Large parts of the city were formerly annexed as personal property to the pre-existing army commanders, and were then ultimately turned over to the state around 1918–1922.

Beginning by the last quarter of the 19th century, the city achieved major developments in carpet industry, and eventually became Iran&#x27;s most important center of carpet production for export markets, continuing up until at least 1940.
Under the reign of Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty, the city was renamed &quot;Arak&quot;. Modern factories for vegetable oil, soap, sugar beet, and wool industries were established within the city. Arak also became an important station for the Trans-Iranian Railway, a major railway project directed by Reza Shah which was completed in 1938.

In 1972, two major state-owned enterprises were established in the city, including an aluminum smelter and a heavy engineering plant. The aluminum smelter was built under the &quot;Regional Cooperation for Development&quot; project of the Central Treaty Organization, in cooperation with the company of Reynolds and Reynolds. The engineering plant was processed with equipment and technical advice from the Soviets, in return of gas sales to the Soviet Union.

The city officially became a metropolis on April 6, 2013, after the merger with Karahrud and Senjan.

<text>The Brothers () is a group of small islands in Cook Strait, New Zealand, off the east coast of Cape Koamaru, Arapaoa Island. The islands are a restricted-access wildlife sanctuary administered by the Department of Conservation.

==Islands==
The Brothers form two small island groups, each containing one main island and a number of tiny islets. The main islands are simply called North Brother and South Brother. South Brother is the larger of the two, covering some , but the North Brother is slightly more elevated, rising to . Most of the smaller islets lie in a small arc south of North Brother, with the largest being only some one hectare in area.

Awash Rock is about south of The Brothers. At high water it is just visible, but strong currents flow around it, as they do between Cape Koamaru and The Brothers, where there are often over falls and whirlpools.

==History==
The Māori name for the group, &quot;Ngāwhatu-kai-ponu&quot;, literally means &quot;the eyes that witnessed&quot; and according to tradition it refers to the eyeballs of the giant octopus, Te Wheke-a-Muturangi, that Kupe battled. The islets were considered &quot;tapu&quot; to Māori. Paddlers making their first crossing of Raukawa/Cook Strait were blindfolded with karaka leaves as it was considered bad luck to see the islands on their first crossing; tohunga and ariki were exempted from this rule.

During Captain James Cook&#x27;s first visit to the area, HMS Endeavour was very nearly wrecked on the Brothers, as a lack of wind and strong tide drove the ship towards the rocks. A change in the direction of the tide saved the ship.

==Lighthouse==
The Brothers Island lighthouse is located on the summit of North Brother. The lighthouse was built in 1877 and is New Zealand&#x27;s only rock station. It replaced the Mana Island lighthouse.

The first call for a lighthouse on the Brothers was in 1851 after the &quot;Maria&quot; sank near Cape Terawhiti. When a lighthouse was erected on Mana Island to serve Cook Strait comment was made in the Marlborough Press that despite the expense it would have been better to have put one on the Brothers. This request was again repeated in the Evening Post in 1870. In 1867 &quot;SS Queen&quot; sank after hitting Cook&#x27;s Rock, just to the north of the Brothers; Cook&#x27;s Rock was lit by a red light once the lighthouse opened. In 1872 the barque &quot;City of Newcastle&quot; was lost because the Captain mistook the Mana Island light for the entrance to Wellington Harbour. In 1874 a report titled &quot;New Zealand Coast Lights&quot; by Captain Johnson was tabled in Parliament and, among others, recommended removing the Mana Island light in favour of a light on the Brothers.

Construction of the lighthouse was difficult because of its isolation and lack of fresh water. Building materials for construction were unable to be delivered to the island for 2 months because of the weather and sea conditions. Workers had to construct huts as tents could not be pitched on the rock. The oil powered light began operation on 24 September 1877. This was replaced in August 1954 to electricity supplied by a 10 hp diesel engine coupled to three 6.8kw generators. A further upgrade occurred in August 1990 when the light was switched to a 50 watt tungsten halogen solar powered beacon and fully automated.

The light was kept by a lighthouse keeper until August 1990. Since then the light has been remotely monitored from Wellington. The lights isolation was very hard on the keepers and supplying the island challenging. Supplies were bought in from Picton and the lighthouse keepers provided weather reports on local conditions at 4.30 am daily, then every hour on the hour till 4 pm.

==Endangered species==

In 1970 The Brothers were declared a sanctuary. North Brother Island is a sanctuary for a rare reptile subspecies, the Brothers Island tuatara (&quot;Sphenodon punctatus guntheri&quot;), and is the type locality for a rare beetle species, the Cook Strait click beetle (&quot;Amychus granulatus&quot;), although the latter is possibly extinct there now.

Others include the diving petrel and the extremely rare dandelion looking plant Kirkianella novae-zealandiae. This plant is only found on North Brother Island and Arapaoa Island. Department of Conservation staff visit the island about four times a year to remove invasive species to protect these and other endangered species.

<doc id="1131367" wikidata="Q1702701" url="?curid=1131367" title="Jomo Sono">
<text>Ephraim Matsilele Sono OIS (born Madoda Walletjies Mkulwana, 17 July 1955), better known as Jomo Sono, is a South African football club owner, coach and former professional footballer. He has been variously nicknamed the &quot;Black Prince of South African Soccer&quot;, &quot;Bra J&quot; and &quot;Mjomana&quot;.

==Early life and football career==

Sono was born in Soweto, South Africa. When he was eight years old, his father Eric Bhamuza Sono, who was a midfielder for the Orlando Pirates football team in the early 1960s, died as a result of a car crash. Soon after, his mother abandoned him. Consequently, Sono was left in the care of his ailing grandparents; as they were very poor, he had to resort to selling apples and peanuts at football games and train stations to clothe himself, buy food for his grandparents and pay school fees. Both his grandparents were born in the then Northern Transvaal at Valdezia village outside Makhado in Limpopo Province.

Sono&#x27;s football career had an unusual beginning; during a match that he attended one of the Orlando Pirates&#x27; regular players was absent and Sono was requested to stand in for him. He soon gained fame for his all-round ability, dribbling and accurate passing skills. It was during this time that he was given the nickname of &quot;Jomo&quot; (which means &quot;burning spear&quot;) by an Orlando Pirates fan, who saw in him the same leadership qualities as those of Jomo Kenyatta, the then president of Kenya.

After he had accomplished everything that he set out to do at Orlando Pirates, Sono went to the United States of America, where, in 1977, he played for the New York Cosmos, where one of his team-mates was the legendary player Pelé. In 1978, he moved to the Colorado Caribous. At the end of the season, the Caribous moved to become the Atlanta Chiefs where Sono played with a fellow South African footballer, Patrick &quot;Ace&quot; Ntsoelengoe. Sono completed his stint in North America playing for the Toronto Blizzard, playing three summers, 1980 through 1982.

Sono also taught and gave demonstrations at Clemson University Soccer Camp for youths.

Sono spent time with Portuguese club Sporting CP and Italian club Juventus, but was unable to obtain work permits for permanent contracts.

==Club owner and coach==

After his football career in the USA ended, Sono returned to South Africa, where he purchased the Highlands Park club in Johannesburg in 1982, renaming it Jomo Cosmos in honour of his old team.

Under his ownership, the club went on to achieve several successes: it won the National Soccer League in 1987, the Bobsave Super Bowl in 1990, the Cola Cola Cup in 2002 and the Super Eight in 2003.

Sono has also taken a leading role in discovering and developing new football talent, especially from rural areas. Some of the players whom Sono recruited and then went on to play for the South African national team and European clubs include Philemon Masinga, Helman Mkhalele, Sizwe Motaung and Mark Fish. Indeed, his recruits formed the core of the South African squad that won the 1996 African Nations Cup; Sono was also a technical advisor to the team&#x27;s head coach Clive Barker during the tournament.

In 1998, Sono was appointed as caretaker coach of the &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; just before the African Nations Cup tournament in Burkina Faso in the place of Clive Barker, who had been sacked just before the event. Under Sono, the team reached the final of the tournament, where they lost to Egypt. Taking the short time that he had to prepare with the team into account, it was considered a remarkable feat.

After a disappointing performance by the South African national squad during the 2002 African Nations Cup in Mali, Sono was again appointed a technical director to the team. However, the head coach of the team at that time, Carlos Queiróz, felt that his position was being undermined by this appointment and resigned. Sono was again appointed as caretaker coach, this time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

During the World Cup, the South African squad did not progress beyond the first round; however, they did score five goals and achieved one win, one draw and a 3–2 loss against pre-tournament favourites Spain. The South African captain, Lucas Radebe, credited Sono with much of the team&#x27;s performance, saying that he had instilled a good spirit within the team and that he had ensured a very positive atmosphere among the squad.

Sono is the longest-serving coach in the South African Premier League and also sits on the board of the Premier Soccer League. He has also built up a reputation as a successful businessman; in addition to making a substantial profit by developing players and selling them to European teams, he also owns a number of businesses and is a chairman of numerous companies. On 22 October 2009 it was announced that he had returned to the South African Football Association, and one day later on 23 October 2009 he took the job as Technical Director.

==Honours==
Sono was voted 49th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

In December 2016, Sono received two doctorates from the University of London and the University of Dubai for his contribution to football and business. Upon receiving the two doctorates he said: &quot;To me this is the greatest achievement. People say it’s from outside [the doctorates], I don’t think it’s from outside. I think it’s from the world because the University of London is one of the biggest and the commonwealth university is one of the biggest.&quot;

==Personal life==
He is married and has four children, including the South Africa national football team member Bamuza Sono, and his second son Matsilela Junior played for Jomo Cosmos.

<text>Unconditional positive regard, a concept initially developed by Stanley Standal in 1954, later expanded and popularized by the humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers in 1956, is the basic acceptance and support of a person regardless of what the person says or does, especially in the context of client-centred therapy. Rogers wrote: For me it expresses the primary theme of my whole professional life, as that theme has been clarified through experience, interaction with others, and research. This theme has been utilized and found effective in many different areas until the broad label &#x27;a person-centred approach&#x27; seems the most descriptive. The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. It is that the individual has within him or her self vast resources for self-understanding, for altering her or his self-concept, attitudes, and self-directed behaviour—and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.
==History==
The concept of unconditional positive regard was developed by Carl Rogers in 1956, expanding on the earlier (1954) work of Stanley Standal. During this time, Rogers was working as a clinical psychologist with children at a mental health clinic in Rochester, New York. While working at the clinic, Rogers became influenced by Jessie Taft, a social worker who believed that the relationship between the therapist and the patient was the most influential part of treatment. This appealed to Rogers and led to his development of client-centered therapy. Client-centered therapy requires four characteristics of the therapist in order to promote the highest level of growth. These include empathy, unconditional positive regard, congruence, and attitude versus technique. 
Rogers defined unconditional positive regard by individually explaining the key elements of the term. He explained that unconditional means, &quot;No conditions of acceptance...It is at the opposite
pole from a selective evaluating attitude.&quot; He wrote that positive means, &quot;A warm acceptance of the person. A genuine caring for the client.&quot; In reference to regard he wrote that, &quot;One regards each aspect of the client&#x27;s experience as being part of that client. It means a caring for the client, but not in a possessive way or in such a way as simply to satisfy the therapist&#x27;s own needs. It means caring for the client as a separate person, with permission to have his [or her] own feelings, his [or her] own experiences.&quot;
In Roger&#x27;s book,&quot; On Becoming A Person&quot;, Rogers cites Stanley Standal as the source of the theory of &quot;unconditional positive regard.&quot;

== Application ==
Rogers believed that unconditional positive regard is essential for healthy development and tried to establish it as a therapeutic component. Through providing unconditional positive regard, humanistic therapists seek to help their clients accept and take responsibility for themselves. Humanistic psychologists believe that by showing the client unconditional positive regard and acceptance, the therapist is providing the best possible conditions for personal growth to the client.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth/Cengage Learning&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, it is essential in any helping relationship to have an anticipation for change. In the counseling relationship, that anticipation presents as &quot;Hope&quot;—an optimism that something good and positive will develop to bring about constructive change in the client&#x27;s personality. Thus, &quot;unconditional positive regard&quot; means that the therapist has and shows overall acceptance of the client by setting aside their own personal opinions and biases. The main factor in unconditional positive regard is the ability to isolate behaviors from the person who displays them.

David G. Myers says the following in his textbook, &quot;Psychology: Eighth Edition in Modules&quot;:People also nurture our growth by being accepting—by offering us what Rogers called unconditional positive regard. This is an attitude of grace, an attitude that values us even knowing our failings. It is a profound relief to drop our pretences, confess our worst feelings, and discover that we are still accepted. In a good marriage, a close family, or an intimate friendship, we are free to be spontaneous without fearing the loss of others&#x27; esteem.

Unconditional positive regard can be facilitated by keeping in mind Rogers&#x27; belief that all people have the internal resources required for personal growth. Rogers theorized that people have an inherent desire towards socially constructive behavior, and this desire is always present whether it is obvious or not. Also, he believed that every individual had a need for self-determination. The urge to be socially constructive increases when a person&#x27;s need for self-determination is respected.

Rogers&#x27; theory encouraged other psychologists to suspend judgement and to listen to clients with an attitude that they have within themselves the ability to change, without actually changing who they are.

==Effect on psychology==

Because it is one part of a larger therapeutic approach, the effect of unconditional positive regard on psychology must be viewed through the context of humanistic psychology, which in the 1960s spawned the widespread human potential movements. By making the positive therapist-client relationship a part of the cure, it also presented a step away from the Freudian tradition which saw the therapist–client relationship as means to an end.

Unconditional positive regard as part of humanistic therapy is still highly regarded by certain therapists, who believe it to be the curative factor in this type of therapy.

==Examples==
There are real examples of how a therapist can use unconditional positive regard. In the article by C. H. Patterson, there are two specific examples of a therapist and client dialogue. In the first dialogue between the therapist and the client, there is absolutely no evidence of unconditional positive regard used. This causes the client to become shut down and unresponsive toward the therapist. The therapist does not engage in a respectful therapeutic manner, which causes less trust for the client:
Therapist: ...another part here too, that is, if they haven&#x27;t got a lot of schooling, there may be a good argument, that, that they- are better judges, you know.

Client: Yeah...

Therapist: Now, I&#x27;m not saying that that&#x27;s necessarily true. I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s reality.

Client: Yeah.

Therapist: And you&#x27;re in a position that you can&#x27;t argue with them. Why is it that these people burn you up so much?

Client: They get by with too many things...

Therapist: Why should that bother you?

Client: &#x27;Cause I never got by with anything.

Therapist: They&#x27;re papa figures, aren&#x27;t they?&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson Brooks/Cole Publishing Co&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the second dialogue between the client and therapist, the therapist uses the unconditional positive regard theory. This seems to work much better for the client. The client is able to better understand the therapeutic methods and have a meaningful therapy session. The therapist works with respect as the main aspect, which only leads to positive outcomes. The more real-life examples from Patterson&#x27;s article gives an idea of how successful unconditional positive regard can be if used appropriately and correctly. 
Client: ...ever recovering to the extent where I could become self-supporting and live alone I thought that I was doomed to hospitalization for the rest of my life and seeing some of the people over in the main building, some of those old people who are, who need a lot of attention and all that sort of thing, is the only picture I could see of my own future, just one of complete hopelessness, that there was any...

Therapist: Mhm 

Therapist: (Interrupting) You didn&#x27;t see any hope at all, did you?

Client: Not in the least. I thought no one really cared and I didn&#x27;t care myself, and I seriously-uh-thought of suicide; if there&#x27;d been any way that I could end it all completely and not become a burden or extra care, I would have committed suicide, I was that low. I didn&#x27;t want to live. In fact, I hoped that I-I would go to sleep at night and not wake up, because I, I really felt there was nothing to live for. (Therapist: Uh-huh [very softly]). Now I, I truly believe that this drug they are giving me helps me a lot, I think, I think it is one drug that really does me good. (Therapist: Uh hm).

Therapist: But you say that, that during that time you, you felt as though no one cared, as to what (Client: That&#x27;s right) what happened to you.

Client: And, not only that, but I hated myself so that I didn&#x27;t deserve to have anyone care for me. I hated myself so that I not only felt that no one did, but I didn&#x27;t see any reason why they should.

==Research implications==
Since its emergence in 1956, unconditional positive regard has received little attention in psychological research. Lietaer, G. (1984) conducted research on the controversy surrounding unconditional positive regard. He stated that unconditional positive regard is one of the most questioned aspects of client-centred therapy. Purton, C. (1998) examined the relationship between spirituality and unconditional positive regard.

==Criticism==

Criticisms have been made regarding the overall effect of the therapy. Ruth Sanford discusses the value of unconditional positive regard in relationships, asking whether it is possible to show unconditional positive regard to the everyday person you may meet on the street or at a nearby market. According to Sanford, in deeper and more meaningful relationships it is possible to show unconditional positive regard to another individual. Sanford argues that unconditional positive regard is not an all-or-nothing concept, but instead falls along a continuum between short-term relationships and deeper long-term personal relationships.

Albert Ellis has criticized unconditional positive regard stating that such an attitude is, in fact, conditional. &quot;Even Carl Rogers, who presumably emphasized unconditional positive regard, actually held that the individual can accept himself only when someone else, such as the therapist, accepts him or loves him unconditionally; so that his self-concept is still dependent on some important element outside himself.&quot; While Ellis strongly supported unconditional positive regard of clients, he believed they could, and had better, accept themselves and adopt unconditional positive regard of themselves whether or not their therapist or anyone else does.

<text>Tuxedo (Transactions for Unix, Extended for Distributed Operations) is a middleware platform used to manage distributed transaction processing in distributed computing environments. Tuxedo is a transaction processing system or transaction-oriented middleware, or enterprise application server for a variety of systems and programming languages.
Developed by AT&amp;T in the 1980s, it became a software product of Oracle Corporation in 2008 when they acquired BEA Systems.
Tuxedo is now part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware.

==History==
From the beginning in 1983, AT&amp;T designed Tuxedo for high availability and to provide extremely scalable applications to support applications requiring thousands of transactions per second on commonly available distributed systems.
The original development targeted the creation and administration of operations support systems for the US telephone company that required online transaction processing (OLTP) capabilities.

The Tuxedo concepts derived from the Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS). Tuxedo supported moving the LMOS application off mainframe systems that used Information Management System (IMS) from IBM on to much cheaper distributed systems running (AT&amp;T&#x27;s own) Unix.

The original Tuxedo team comprised members of the LMOS team, including Juan M. Andrade, Mark T. Carges, Terrence Dwyer, and Stephen Felts.
In 1993 Novell acquired the Unix System Laboratories (USL) division of AT&amp;T which was responsible for the development of Tuxedo at the time. In September 1993 it was called the &quot;best known&quot; distributed transaction processing monitor, running on 25 different platforms.
In February 1996, BEA Systems made an exclusive agreement with Novell to develop and distribute Tuxedo on non-NetWare platforms, with most Novell employees working with Tuxedo joining BEA.
In 2008, Oracle Corporation acquired BEA Systems, and TUXEDO was marketed as part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware product line.

Tuxedo has been used as transactional middleware by a number of multi-tier application development tools. The Open Group used some of the Tuxedo interfaces as the basis of their standards such as X/Open XA and XATMI.

The Tuxedo developers published papers about it in the early 1990s.
Later it became the basis of some research projects.

===Messaging core===

Tuxedo is at its core a message routing and queuing system. Requests are sent to named services and Tuxedo uses memory-based inter-process communication facilities to queue the requests to servers. The requester is unaware of where the server that actually processes the request is located or how it is implemented. In essence, Tuxedo provided the elements of service-oriented architecture (SOA) decades before the phrase was coined. Tuxedo can use the content of the message to determine what servers should be utilized to receive the request by means of data-dependent routing.

===Clustering===
The heart of the Tuxedo system is the Bulletin Board (BB). This is a shared memory segment that contains the configuration and state of a Tuxedo domain. Servers, services, transactions, and clients are all registered in the BB providing a global view of their state across the machines within a domain. To coordinate updates to the BB a process called the Bulletin Board Liaison (BBL) runs on each machine to keep the local copy of the BB up-to-date. A master machine runs a process called the &quot;Distinguished Bulletin Board Liaison&quot; that coordinates the updates to the BB. This allows each machine to have a view of what servers, services, transactions, and clients are on each machine within the domain.

Another process on each machine called the Bridge is responsible for passing requests from one machine to another. This allows Tuxedo to spread load across the various machines within a domain and allows servers and services to be running on multiple machines. In addition, the BBL and Bridge monitor each other and restart the other should one fail. In the advent of a failure of the master machine, another machine designated as a backup master can take over the function of master machine. Also, since machines within a single domain can be of different architectures (x86, IA32, SPARC, P-Series, etc.), the Bridge is also responsible for handling differences in things like endianness.

On Oracle Exalogic Tuxedo leverages the RDMA capabilities of InfiniBand to bypass the bridge. This allows the client of a service on one machine to directly make a request of a server on another machine.

===Flexible buffer formats===
Tuxedo applications can utilize a variety of message formats depending upon the type of data that is to be passed. One of the most popular formats is the FML buffer format which is much like a binary XML or ASN.1 format. FML buffers can contain an arbitrary number of named fields of arbitrary type. Fields can be repeated and nested. As it is a self-describing binary format, the processing of fields incurs very little overhead in comparison to the parsing necessary to support something like XML. VIEW buffers are essentially records, C structures, or COBOL copybooks. A VIEW buffer has an external description which allows Tuxedo to access the fields within it if necessary for things like data dependent routing. Other buffer formats include XML, CARRAY (opaque binary data), STRING, and MBSTRING (a string buffer containing multibyte characters.) Tuxedo can automatically and transparently convert FML buffers to and from XML buffers.

There is also support for user-developed buffer types (for example JamFlex buffers defined by Tuxedo version of Panther RAD toolset).

===Communication concentrators===
For remote clients (Java, CORBA, or/WS), Tuxedo provides communication concentrators called listener/handlers that handle the remote network communication. Clients connect to these communication concentrators, which act as proxies for the clients. As clients make requests, the listener/handler uses the local Tuxedo infrastructure to make the request on the behalf of the client. Tuxedo then load balances the requests across the servers within the domain that offer the service even if the server is not on the local machine. This is in contrast to most Java EE application servers where load balancing is done by the client making requests to different machines with the cluster.

===Gateways===
To facilitate the sharing of services across domains, Tuxedo provides domain gateways. A domain gateway allows importing and exporting services from remote domains. This allows the local domain to see services on remote domains as though they were local services. The domain gateways are responsible for propagating security and transaction context to the remote domain. Besides connecting Tuxedo domains together, domain gateways exist for mainframe systems using TCP/IP, IBM&#x27;s Systems Network Architecture (SNA), or the OSI protocols, and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition application servers. For the mainframe gateways, each system sees the services imported from the remote system as local services and use the local systems infrastructure to interact with those services. This means that Tuxedo sees a CICS transaction as a Tuxedo service, and CICS sees a Tuxedo service as a CICS transaction.

===Failure recovery===
The BBL on each machine monitors the state of all servers and can automatically restart failed servers. It can also detect hung servers and kill/restart them as required. The BRIDGE process in a clustered environment monitors to BBL, so there are no single points of failure. Any transactions that are affected by a server or machine failure and that have not completed the prepare phase are rolled back. Transactions that have completed the prepare phase but not the commit phase will be committed as part of the Tuxedo boot sequence.

===Transaction monitoring and coordination===
Tuxedo applications can request that all service invocations and their associated updates to any resources controlled by resource managers (such as databases) be controlled by a transaction. Once the application begins a transaction, all subsequent service invocations and nested invocations are included as part of that transaction, even those services that were executed on remote domains. Tuxedo then coordinates the commit processing with the resource managers to ensure atomic updates to all affected resources. Transactions can be controlled by the application or automatically controlled by the Tuxedo configuration, i.e., container managed transactions.

===Queuing subsystem===
Tuxedo provides a queuing subsystem called /Q. This facility provides transient and persistent queues that allows applications to explicitly enqueue and dequeue messages from named queues. Queues can be ordered by message availability time, expiration time, priority, LIFO, FIFO, or a combination. Queues are managed by an XA compliant resource manager allowing queue operations to participate in distributed transactions. An automated queue forwarding server is provided that will remove entries from a queue and invoke an associated Tuxedo services, placing the reply message on an associated reply queue.

===Event subsystem===
The event subsystem within Tuxedo provides support for unsolicited events as well as brokered events. Unsolicited events allow Tuxedo applications to send out-of-band notifications to clients that aren&#x27;t necessarily waiting for a response. Brokered events allow application to subscribe to events of interest and when another application posts an event, all applications subscribed to that event receive it. This allows applications to use an event driven model instead of the more typical request/response model. As well this provides a publish and subscribe messaging model that can be combined with /Q.

==Add-on products==
Oracle offers a number of add-on products to Tuxedo.

===Mainframe re-hosting===
In March 2010, Oracle announced two new products.
Application Runtime for CICS and Batch along with the associated Oracle Tuxedo Application Rehosting Workbench allows the migration of IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) and batch applications onto Tuxedo on distributed systems. By providing automated conversion tools, CICS equivalent API pre-processor macro expansion, and a JES-2 like Batch execution environment, the migration of mainframe applications is greatly simplified.

===SALT===
This product provides a bi-directional web services SOAP/HTTP(S) gateway. This gateway allows Tuxedo services to be accessed by external SOAP clients without making any changes to the Tuxedo service. Likewise, Tuxedo applications can call an external web service as though it were a local Tuxedo service. The latest version of SALT supports WS-AtomicTransactions and modules for Apache Web Server, Oracle HTTP Server, and Oracle iPlanet Web Server, that allows the creation of dynamic web content by calling Tuxedo services.
In version 12.1.3 SALT added support for RESTful services.

===TSAM Plus===
This product provides centralized monitoring capabilities for multiple Tuxedo domains. TSAM Plus agents are deployed on the machines in a Tuxedo domain. These agents collect metric data from the running Tuxedo processes based on a configured policy, and send the data back to the TSAM Plus Manager where it is used historically or in real time. TSAM Plus provides configuration information, call path, call pattern, service execution, transaction, and more monitoring metrics. TSAM Plus also monitors Tuxedo ART CICS and Batch applications. An additional component of TSAM Plus is a plug-in for Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control that provides full operation, configuration, administration, and management of a Tuxedo application.

===Tuxedo Mainframe Adapters (TMA)===
This product provides a set of gateway processes that run on Tuxedo that communicate with a mainframe using its native protocols. This gateway provides bidirectional integration between mainframe and Tuxedo platforms and makes Tuxedo appear as a remote CICS or IMS region to the mainframe, and the remote CICS or IMS region as another Tuxedo domain to the local Tuxedo application.

===JCA Adapter===
The Tuxedo JCA adapter provide a JCA 1.5 compliant Resource Adapter that can be deployed to any Java EE (J2EE) 1.5 or later JCA container. The adapter supports both the JCA Common Client interface or CCI, as well as the JATMI interface supported by the Oracle WebLogic Tuxedo Connector component of Oracle WebLogic Server. Message inflow and outflow is supported along with distributed transaction support.

===Tuxedo Message Queue===
Provides enterprise messaging capabilities that combines the features of Oracle MessageQ with Tuxedo. This extends the existing /Q message queuing facility of Tuxedo by providing things like delivery notification, offline messaging, and store and forward capability.

<text>John Gilbert Brogden (born 28 March 1969) is an Australian businessman, philanthropist, and former politician. He was a Liberal Party member for Pittwater in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from May 1996 until his resignation in August 2005, and served as the leader of the opposition in New South Wales from 2002 to 2005. 

After politics, Brogden served as the chairman and CEO of various organisations in the financial services and property sectors. After a suicide attempt in August 2005 immediately after his resignation as opposition leader, Brogden would join the board of the crisis support charity Lifeline in 2009, and subsequently became its chairman from 2011 to 2021.

==Early life and family==
Brogden was born in Balmain and raised in Sydney. His father Gilbert Arthur Brogden, a carpenter, was born in Taranaki, New Zealand in 1933 and emigrated to Australia in 1960. His mother, Judith Anne (née Bourne) (1941 – 2021) was born in Balmain and worked as a School Secretary. He was educated at St Joan of Arc, Haberfield, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield and the University of Sydney where he gained a Master of Public Affairs (MPA).

His wife, Lucy Brogden AM, is an organisational psychologist and national mental health and suicide prevention advocate, a carer, a Patron of Partners in Depression, Patron of the Sydney Women&#x27;s Fund and Lifeline Northern Beaches, Chair of the Diabetes Australia Research Trust, a, Director of the National Film and Sound Archives and of Be Kind Australia. She is Governor of Queenwood School for Girls. From 2017 to 2022, she was the chair of the National Mental Health Commission advising the Prime Minister and Minister for Health on mental health policy. They have three children.

==Political career==
John Brogden joined the Liberal Party in his final year of high school in 1986. Between 1989 and 1994 he was an adviser to Attorney General John Hannaford, Premier John Fahey and Police Minister Ted Pickering. From 1992 to 1993 he was President of the NSW Division of the Young Liberal Movement, and a member of the NSW Division&#x27;s State Executive. In 1994, he served a year as Treasurer of the Movement and ran unsuccessfully for preselection in the state seat of Vaucluse. Brogden had lost the Vaucluse preselection to Peter Debnam and Debnam would later succeed Brogden as Liberal leader in 2005.

Brogden was elected to the NSW Legislative Assembly as the Member for Pittwater in May 1996 in a by-election following the resignation of former Fahey Government Minister Jim Longley. In 1999, he was promoted to the Shadow Ministry as the Shadow Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Sydney Water and Youth Affairs.

In the leadup to the 2003 New South Wales state election, Opposition Leader Kerry Chikarovski was struggling in the polls against Premier Bob Carr. On 25 March 2002, Brogden announced a challenge. Three days later on 28 March 2002, his 33rd birthday, he succeeded in a 15–14 vote, becoming the youngest ever leader of a state or federal Liberal Party.

What was not known at the time was that state Liberal director Scott Morrison had a plan to have Chikarovski replaced by Malcolm Turnbull, with the plan abandoned as a result of Brogden&#x27;s successful challenge.
Turnbull and Morrison went on to be elected to Federal Parliament and in 2015 Turnbull became Prime Minister and Morrison his Treasurer. Morrison succeeded Turnbull as Prime Minister in 2018.

At the 2003 election, the Liberals won one seat from Labor and lost one to Labor. Notwithstanding the electoral defeat, Brogden improved his and the party&#x27;s standing in the polls over the next two years. Many people believing that Brogden would win the 2007 New South Wales state election, especially when Bob Carr resigned from politics and Morris Iemma was elected as the new Premier.

Brogden confronted the government over a number of issues, often focussing on health and police corruption. He aggressively pursued the Carr government over its involvement in the Orange Grove affair, in which a shopping centre was shut down, allegedly for zoning reasons, amidst claims of political pressure from The Westfield Group, which ran a neighbouring shopping centre.

Despite the improvement in the opposition&#x27;s opinion poll ratings during 2004 and early 2005, Brogden&#x27;s hopes that he would gain the premiership in 2007 were not to be fulfilled. He became embroiled in controversy for his behaviour at a function in Sydney on 29 July 2005. As a result of the controversy, Brogden resigned as Leader of the NSW Opposition on 29 August. Nevertheless, he announced his intention to remain as the Member for Pittwater.

The next day however, 30 August, police attended Brogden&#x27;s electorate office at around 10.30 pm, after concerns were raised by members of his family. They found him unconscious in a back room, having attempted suicide. When &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called Brogden&#x27;s deputy Barry O&#x27;Farrell at about 11 pm to question him about possible leadership contention, he told them, &quot;Excuse me if I say I don&#x27;t care about the leadership at the moment, but I am following an ambulance with John Brogden inside. He has attempted self-harm. It sort of puts things in perspective, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;. Brogden was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital that night, and discharged the following day into respite care at the Northside Clinic. On 1 September, Brogden and his wife issued a short statement thanking people who had sent messages of support, and inviting people wishing to help further to donate to Beyond Blue.

Brogden resigned from parliament on 28 September. A by-election was held for the seat of Pittwater, which, in a backlash to the Liberal Party and media treatment of Brogden, was won by Pittwater Council mayor Alex McTaggart, running as an independent. At the 2007 state election, McTaggart was defeated by Liberal candidate Rob Stokes, a former adviser to Brogden.

==Business career and philanthropy==

In May 2018, Brogden was appointed as Chief Executive Officer at Landcom. Prior to this appointment, he was Chairman of the Board at UrbanGrowth NSW/Landcom from 2012 to 2018.

In November 2009, Brogden joined the board of Australian suicide prevention charity Lifeline, and was promoted to chairman in 2011. In February 2021, Brogden became the president of Lifeline International, a charity that supports international crisis centres &quot;through policy, research, knowledge sharing and capacity building efforts we undertake globally&quot;. Brogden remains a patron of the organization. 

In 2014, Brogden was named as a member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the community and social welfare.

<doc id="1131381" wikidata="Q463573" url="?curid=1131381" title="Suzerainty">
<text>Suzerainty () includes the rights and obligations of a person, state, or other polity which controls the foreign policy and relations of a tributary state but allows the tributary state internal autonomy. Where the subordinate party is called a vassal, vassal state, or tributary state, the dominant party is called a suzerain. The rights and obligations of a vassal are called vassalage, and the rights and obligations of a suzerain are called suzerainty.

Suzerainty differs from sovereignty in that the dominant power allows tributary states to be technically independent but enjoy only limited self-rule. Although the situation has existed in a number of historical empires, it is considered difficult to reconcile with 20th- or 21st-century concepts of international law, in which sovereignty is a binary concept, which either exists or does not. While a sovereign state can agree by treaty to become a protectorate of a stronger power, modern international law does not recognise any way of making this relationship compulsory on the weaker power. Suzerainty is a practical, &quot;de facto&quot; situation, rather than a legal, &quot;de jure&quot; one.

Current examples include Bhutan and India. India is responsible for military training, arms supplies, and the air defense of Bhutan.

==Imperial China==

The tributary system of China or &quot;Cefeng&quot; system was a network of loose international relations focused on China which facilitated trade and foreign relations by acknowledging China&#x27;s predominant role in East Asia. It involved multiple relationships of trade, military force, diplomacy and ritual. The other states had to send a tributary envoy to China on schedule, who would kowtow to the Chinese emperor as a form of tribute, and acknowledge his superiority and precedence. The other countries followed China&#x27;s formal ritual in order to keep the peace with the more powerful neighbor and be eligible for diplomatic or military help under certain conditions. Political actors within the tributary system were largely autonomous and in almost all cases virtually independent.

The term &quot;tribute system&quot; as applied to China is a Western invention. There was no equivalent term in the Chinese lexicon to describe what would be considered the &quot;tribute system&quot; today, nor was it envisioned as an institution or system. John King Fairbank and Teng Ssu-yu created the &quot;tribute system&quot; theory in a series of articles in the early 1940s to describe &quot;a set of ideas and practices developed and perpetuated by the rulers of China over many centuries.&quot; The Fairbank model presents the tribute system as an extension of the hierarchic and nonegalitarian Confucian social order. The more Confucian the actors, the more likely they were to participate in the tributary system.

In practice the behaviours which were collectively seen as a tributary system, involving tribute and gift exchange in return for symbolic subordination, were only formalized during the early years of the Ming dynasty. Tributary members were virtually autonomous and carried out their own agendas despite paying tribute; this was the case with Japan, Korea, Ryukyu, and Vietnam. Chinese influence on tributary states was almost always non-interventionist in nature and tributary states &quot;normally could expect no military assistance from Chinese armies should they be invaded&quot;.

The Chinese tributary system was upended in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of Western and Japanese colonialism. Japan took Korea and the Ryukyu Islands, France took Vietnam, and Britain took Upper Burma.

Since colonial times, Britain had regarded Tibet as being under Chinese suzerainty, but in 2008 the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called that word an &quot;anachronism&quot; in a statement, and recognized Tibet as part of China.

==Ancient Israel and Near East==
Suzerainty treaties and similar covenants and agreements between Middle Eastern states were quite prevalent during the pre-monarchic and monarchy periods in Ancient Israel. The Hittites, Egyptians, and Assyrians had been suzerains to the Israelites and other tribal kingdoms of the Levant from 1200 to 600 BC. The structure of Jewish covenant law was similar to the Hittite form of suzerain.

Each treaty would typically begin with an &quot;Identification&quot; of the Suzerain, followed by an historical prologue cataloguing the relationship between the two groups &quot;with emphasis on the benevolent actions of the suzerain towards the vassal&quot;. Following the historical prologue came the stipulation. This included tributes, obligations and other forms of subordination that would be imposed on the Israelites. According to the Hittite form, after the stipulations were offered to the vassal, it was necessary to include a request to have copies of the treaty that would be read throughout the kingdom periodically. The treaty would have divine and earthly witnesses purporting the treaty&#x27;s validity, trustworthiness, and efficacy. This also tied into the blessings that would come from following the treaty and the curses from breaching it. For disobedience, curses would be given to those who had not remained steadfast in carrying out the stipulations of the treaty.

===Hittite suzerainty treaty form===
Below is a form of a Hittite suzerainty treaty.
* Preamble: Identifies the parties involved in the treaty, the author, the title of the sovereign party, and usually his genealogy. It usually emphasises the greatness of the king or dominant party.
* Prologue: Lists the deeds already performed by the Suzerain on behalf of the vassal. This section would outline the previous relationship the two groups had up until that point with historical detail and facts that are very beneficial to scholars today, such as scholar George Mendenhall who focuses on this type of covenant as it pertained to the Israelite traditions. The suzerain would document previous events in which they did a favor that benefitted the vassal. The purpose of this would show that the more powerful group was merciful and giving, therefore, the vassal should obey the stipulations that are presented in the treaty. It discusses the relationship between them as a personal relationship instead of a solely political one. Most importantly in this section, the vassal is agreeing to future obedience for the benefits that he received in the past without deserving them.
* Stipulations: Terms to be upheld by the vassal for the life of the treaty; defines how the vassal is obligated and gives more of the legalities associated with the covenant.
* Provision for annual public reading: A copy of the treaty was to be read aloud annually in the vassal state for the purpose of renewal and to inform the public of the expectations involved and increase respect for the sovereign party, usually the king.
* Divine witness to the treaty: These usually include the deities of both the Suzerain and the vassal, but put special emphasis on the deities of the vassal.
* Blessings if the stipulations of the treaty were upheld and curses if the stipulations were not upheld. These blessings and curses were generally seen to come from the gods instead of punishment by the dominant party for example.
* Sacrificial meal: Both parties would share a meal to show their participation in the treaty.

==India==

===British paramountcy===

The British East India Company conquered Bengal in 1757, and gradually extended its control over the whole of India. It annexed many of the erstwhile Indian kingdoms (&quot;states&quot;, in British terminology) but entered into alliances with others. Some states were created by the East India Company itself through the grant of &quot;jagirs&quot; to influential allies. The states varied enormously in size and influence, with Hyderabad at the upper end with 16.5 million people and an annual revenue of 100 million rupees and states like Babri at the lower end with a population of 27 people and annual revenue of 80 rupees.

The principle of paramountcy was explicitly stated in a letter by Lord Reading to the Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, in 1926, &quot;The sovereignty of the British Crown is supreme in India and therefore no ruler of an Indian State can justifiably claim to negotiate with the British Government on an equal footing.&quot; This meant that the Indian states were crown dependencies or protectorates of the British Indian government. They could not make war or have any direct dealings with foreign states. Neither did they enjoy full internal autonomy. The British government could and did interfere in their internal affairs if the imperial interests were involved or if it proved necessary in the interest of so-stated &quot;good governance&quot;. In some cases, the British government also deposed these Indian princes.

According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal the system of paramountcy was a system of limited sovereignty only in appearance. In reality, it was a system of recruitment of a reliable base of support for the imperial state. The support of the Imperial State obviated the need for the rulers to seek legitimacy through patronage and dialogue with their populations. Through their direct as well as indirect rule through the princes, the colonial state turned the population of India into &#x27;subjects&#x27; rather than citizens.

The Government of India Act 1935 envisaged that India would be a federation of autonomous provinces balanced by Indian princely states. This plan never came to fruition. The political conditions were oppressive in several princely states giving rise to political movements. Under pressure from Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian National Congress resolved not to interfere directly but called on the princes to increase civil liberties and reduce their own privileges.

With the impending independence of India in 1947, the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten announced that the British paramountcy over Indian states would come to an end. The states were advised to accede to one of the new dominions, India or Pakistan. An Instrument of Accession was devised for this purpose. The Congress leaders agreed to the plan on the condition that Mountbatten ensure that the majority of the states within the Indian territory accede to India. Under pressure from the governor-general, all the Indian states acceded to India save two, Junagadh and Hyderabad.

===Sikkim===
Following the independence of India in 1947, a treaty signed between the Chogyal of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal, and the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru gave India suzerainty over Kingdom of Sikkim in exchange for it retaining its independence. This continued until 1975, when the Sikkimese monarchy was abolished in favour of a merger into India. Sikkim is now one of the states of India.

===Lakshadweep (Laccadives)===
Located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep is a Union territory of India off the coast of the southwestern state of Kerala.
The Aminidivi group of islands (Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlat and Bitra) came under the rule of Tipu Sultan in 1787. They passed on to British control after the Third Anglo-Mysore War and were attached to the South Canara district. The rest of the islands became a suzerainty of the Arakkal Kingdom of Cannanore in return for a payment of annual tribute.

After a while, the British took over the administration of those islands for non-payment of arrears. These islands were attached to the Malabar district of the Madras Presidency. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act separated these islands from the mainland administrative units, forming a new union territory by combining all the islands.

==Pakistan==

The princely states of the British Raj which acceded to Pakistan maintained their sovereignty with the Government of Pakistan acting as the suzerain until 1956 for Bahawalpur, Khairpur, and the Balochistan States, 1969 for Chitral and the Frontier States, and 1974 for Hunza and Nagar. All these territories have since been merged into Pakistan. These states were subject to the &#x27;paramountcy&#x27; of the British Crown. The term was never precisely defined but it meant that the Indian states were subject to the suzerainty of the British Crown exercised through the Viceroy of India.

==South African Republic==
After the First Boer War (1880–81), the South African Republic was granted its independence, albeit under British suzerainty. During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the South African Republic was annexed as the Transvaal Colony, which existed until 1910, when it became the Province of Transvaal in the Union of South Africa.

==German Empire==
Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918), the German Empire received a very short-lived suzerainty over the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. New monarchies were created in Lithuania and the United Baltic Duchy (which comprised the modern countries of Latvia and Estonia). The German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (in Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (in the United Baltic Duchy), were appointed as rulers. This plan was detailed by German Colonel General Erich Ludendorff, who wrote, &quot;German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.&quot;

==Second World War==
Despite being occupied by the Axis powers, several Western and Asian countries were allowed to exercise self-rule. Several states were created in order to facilitate their occupation, including Vichy France, Manchukuo, the Empire of Vietnam, the Independent State of Croatia in Croatia and the Lokot Autonomy in Central Russia.

==Suzerainties in fiction==
In J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the Mouth of Sauron proposes terms of surrender that would effectively give Mordor suzerainty over Gondor and Rohan: &quot;The rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once beyond the Anduin, first taking oaths never again to assail Sauron the Great in arms, open or secret. ... West of the Anduin as far as the Misty Mountains and the Gap of Rohan shall be tributary to Mordor, and men there shall bear no weapons, but shall have leave to govern their own affairs.&quot;

In Season 7 of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, Castiel briefly attains god-like powers and takes direct control of Heaven. He then meets with the King of Hell, Crowley, to propose an arrangement in which Crowley maintains control over Hell&#x27;s internal affairs but pledges allegiance to Castiel. He also requires Crowley to give him control over the distribution of souls between Heaven and Hell, as souls are a source of supernatural power that Castiel needs to maintain his dominance. Reasoning that he has no choice, Crowley promptly agrees to this arrangement.

<text>San Cibrao (the name is Galician; also known by the Spanish-language San Ciprián), is an industrial and fishing town, part of Cervo (which is both a settlement and municipality of the Lugo Province) in Northwestern Spain. The population of San Cibrao is about 3,000 in July and August and about 2,000 year-round.

== Port of San Cibrao ==
* Commercial port
* Fishing port
* Sport port

== History, tourism and general information==
During the High Middle Ages caravels were built in the port. The area does not draw many tourists; the regional economy continues to depend on fishing and on an aluminium plant owned by Alcoa.

The nearby peninsula has fine sand beaches. It is generally undeveloped and receives strong north-easterly winds throughout the winter, which makes the &quot;comarca&quot; or administrative unit of la Mariña Lucense, like much of the Asturian and Basque coast, excellent for surfing and water sports.

Part of the town of San Cibrao lies on the &quot;Peace Peninsula&quot; (&quot;Peninsula de la Paz&quot;) which is surrounded by the Cantabrian Sea, whose waters in this area typically reach a high summer temperature of 18 °C; there are five beaches in the area.

, neither the shellfish and fish populations, nor any seafood related industries seems to be still affected in any way by the contamination from the Prestige oil spill

The fiesta of &quot;A Maruxaina&quot; is celebrated on the second Saturday of August. It is related to a popular legend about a siren who lives on some small islands, Os farallons, near San Cibrao. This festival has been distinguished by the National Centers of Cultural Interest. Most of the townspeople dress on this day as &quot;Maruxainos&quot;, that is, in costumes that resemble the dress of days past. Ritually, at noon, the mariners bring the siren from the islands onto shore, were in front of the museum they create a mock-trial to judge the &quot;Maruxaina&quot; on whether she is good or bad. After this the townsfolk serve a potent brew of &quot;&quot;Queimada&quot;.&quot;

== Industries ==
* Bauxite mining and Alcoa&#x27;s alumina refinery. 
* Fishing port.
* The Royal Factory of Sargadelos in Cervo nearby San Cibrao (Since 1791); one of the oldest and most renowned manufacturers of fine pottery in Galicia. This is also a tourist destination.

<text>Mawsynram () is a town in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya state in Northeastern India, 69 kilometres from Shillong, the state capital. Mawsynram receives the highest rainfall in India. It is reportedly the wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of . According to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, Mawsynram received of rainfall in 1985.
Mawsynram received 745.2 mm of rainfall on 19 August 2015, probably the highest rainfall received by the town in recent times. On 17 June 2022, Mawsynram set a new record by receiving 1003.6 mm in a span of 24 hours which has now become its highest single day record for the month of June and for its all-time single day record, beating its former record of 944.7 mm on 7 June 1966.

==Location==

Mawsynram is located at 25° 18′ N, 91° 35′ E, at an altitude of about 1,400 meters (4,600 ft), 15 km west of Cherrapunji, in the Khasi Hills in the state of Meghalaya (India).

===Climate and rainfall===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Mawsynram features a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) with an extraordinarily showery, rainy and long monsoonal season and a short dry season. Based on the data of a recent few decades, it appears to be the wettest place in the world, or the place with the highest average annual rainfall. Mawsynram receives over of rain in an average year, and the vast majority of the rain it gets falls during the monsoon months. A comparison of rainfalls for Cherrapunji and Mawsynram for some years is given in Table 1.
Mawsynram receives the highest rainfall in India. Although it is reportedly the wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of , this claim is disputed by Lloró, Colombia, which reported an average yearly rainfall of between 1952 and 1989 and López de Micay, also in Colombia, which reported per year between 1960 and 2012. According to the records observed by the Indian Meteorological Department, it was seen that while its neighbour, Cherrapunji is having a significant decreasing trend in rainfall, Mawsynram on the other hand is experiencing a slight increase in its rainfall pattern which put its average annual rainfall from 1950 to 2000 at and from 2000 to 2020 at . The precipitation table below shows the average monthly record from 1950 to 2000.

Primarily due to the high altitude, it seldom gets truly hot in Mawsynram. Average monthly temperatures range from around in January to just above in August. The village also experiences a brief but noticeably drier season from December until February, when monthly precipitation on average does not exceed . The little precipitation during the village&#x27;s &quot;low sun&quot; season is something that is shared by many areas with this type of climate.

The following table is a comparison of rainfalls for Cherrapunji and Mawsynram between 1970 and 2010.
Source: 

Three reasons can be cited for high rainfall at Mawsynram:
#The warm moist winds of the northward-moving air from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon, which cover an extensive area but are forced to converge into the narrower zone over the Khasi Hills, thus concentrating their moisture.
#The alignment of the Khasi Hills (east to west) places them directly in the path of the airflow from the Bay of Bengal, producing a significant uplift (plus cooling, further condensation and thus more rain).
#Finally, uplift over the Khasi Hills is virtually continuous in the monsoon period because the lifted air is constantly being pulled up by vigorous winds in the upper atmosphere; hence, the rainfall is more or less continuous.

===Natural landmarks===
Located in Mawsynram, is a cave named Mawjymbuin, known for its stalagmites. Inside this cave is a pair of notable speleothems - stalactites shaped like a cow&#x27;s udder over a large stalagmite. The area is known for its many caves, both commercialized and non-commercialized.

<doc id="1131397" wikidata="Q1852060" url="?curid=1131397" title="Megacorporation">
<text>Megacorporation, mega-corporation, or megacorp, a term originally coined by Alfred Eichner in his book &quot;The Megacorp and Oligopoly: Micro Foundations of Macro Dynamics&quot; but popularized by William Gibson,
 derives from the combination of the prefix &quot;mega-&quot; with the word &quot;corporation&quot;. It has become widespread in cyberpunk literature. It is synonymous with syndicate, globalist- or transnational capital. It refers to a corporation (normally fictional) that is a massive conglomerate (usually private), holding monopolistic or near-monopolistic control over multiple markets (thus exhibiting both a horizontal and a vertical monopoly). Megacorps are so powerful that they are above the government laws, possess their own heavily armed (often military-sized) private armies, are operators of privatized police forces, hold &quot;sovereign&quot; territory, and even act as outright governments. They often exercise a large degree of control over their employees, taking the idea of &quot;corporate culture&quot; to an extreme.

==Examples in literature==
Such organizations as a staple of science fiction long predate cyberpunk, appearing in the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick (&quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, 1968), Thea von Harbou (&quot;Metropolis&quot;, 1927), Robert A. Heinlein (&quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot;, 1957), Robert Asprin (&quot;The Cold Cash War&quot;, 1977), and Andre Norton (the &quot;Solar Queen&quot; novels). The explicit use of the term in the &quot;Traveller&quot; science fiction roleplaying game from 1977 predates Gibson&#x27;s use of it. The transnationals, and later metanationals in Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s Mars Trilogy are an example of mega corporations that exceed most countries in political influence.

==Examples in film==
In the Alien film franchise characters are repeatedly manipulated and endangered by the unscrupulous megacorporation Weyland-Yutani, which seeks to profit from the Aliens.

In the 2016 film of Assassin&#x27;s Creed, the character Cal Lynch of descended 15th century Spanish Assassin Aguilar de Nerha was captured by the modern-day Templar organization of Abstergo Foundation in Madrid to locate the Apple of Eden.
In the animated Pixar film &quot;WALL-E&quot;, the megacorporation Buy n&#x27; Large has completely supplanted every planetary government.

In the &quot;Avatar&quot; series of films, the Resources Development Administration (RDA) is a megacorporation that outmatches most governments in wealth, influence, and military power. The RDA has monopolized ownership of all extraterrestrial colonies and assets, granted in perpetuity by an international committee.

== Examples in games ==
In the sci-fi strategy game &quot;Stellaris,&quot; players can choose to control a megacorporation that has consumed all aspects of their alien government, with variable policies such as indentured servitude, media conglomerates, or even employee resurrection.

In the video game &quot;The Outer Worlds,&quot; many megacorps purchase the rights to solar systems from Earth governments. Corporate colonies, being lightyears away from government influence, are effectively governed by their parent companies, with employment acting as citizenship.

In the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise, a modern day Templar conglomerate of Abstergo kidnaps people who have their descendant of the Assassins Brotherhood which was put in the Animus for their information and to locate the pieces of eden. 

In the &quot;Doom&quot; video game franchise, the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC)—a multi-planetary conglomerate—is often referred to as a megacorporation.

In the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; franchise, each of the featured galaxies is dominated by an arms manufacturer with a near-total monopoly on commercial activity, the largest of which is simply called &quot;Megacorp&quot;.

In Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Shinra Electric Power Company is referred as a megacorporation because of its dominance of Mako energy and electricity and actively competes with the nation of Wutai by having its own military which helps with their dominance amongst the populace.

In Shadows of Doubt, the Starch Kola megacorporation is elected as the leader of the fictional nation of United Atlantic States where all the cities in the games are located. They have a privatized police force known as Starch Kola Enforcers which is based out of every City Halls in the United Atlantic States.

In &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, several megacorps (most notably Arasaka and Militech) are multinational entities that dominate nearly every aspect of society, from politics to the economy. These corporations are so powerful that they function almost like states unto themselves, exerting control over vast territories and influencing the daily lives of the populace. They often operate outside or above the reach of traditional governments, often exhibit cutthroat, morally bankrupt practices, driven by a relentless pursuit of profit and power. Ethics are secondary, and corporate warfare—both economic and physical—can result in the deaths of thousands, if not millions. These corporations will often engage in sabotage, espionage, or even orchestrate political coups to secure their interests. They also manipulate public opinion through media and control over information, ensuring their image remains pristine while their unethical activities remain hidden. 

In the Titanfall franchise, which contains &quot;Apex Legends&quot;, a megacorporation named Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation [IMC] dominates the entire mining and manufacturing industry across the &quot;Frontier&quot; (galaxy) based on Earth, well as maintaining private military contractors to suppress dissidents.

==Real-life examples==
Although the term itself arose out of science fiction, certain real-life corporations, such as colonial-era chartered companies and zaibatsu, have achieved or approached megacorporation status in various ways. The private Dutch East India Company, for example, operated 40 warships and had 10,000 private soldiers to monitor its farflung spice empire, while the British East India Company controlled a large colonial empire and maintained a 300,000 strong standing army in the mid-19th century before the company was dissolved and its territories absorbed into the British Empire. In the French colonial empire, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was once the world&#x27;s largest landowner, exercising legal control and a trading monopoly on its territory known as Rupert&#x27;s Land which consisted of 15% of the North American land mass.

Today many countries have competition laws (also known as antitrust laws) to prevent real-life corporations from having mega-corporation characteristics. On the other hand, some countries protect a certain industry deemed important by mandating that only a single company, usually state-owned, can operate in it. An example of the latter is Saudi Arabia, which gains the majority of its government revenues through its mega-corporation Saudi Aramco.

In the book &quot;The Wal-Mart Effect&quot;, Charles Fishman describes Walmart as &quot;[in] a whole class of megacorporations of which Wal-Mart is just the most extreme, vivid example&quot;.
