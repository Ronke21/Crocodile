<text>An institute of technology (also referred to as technological university, technical university, university of technology, polytechnic university) is an institution of tertiary education that specializes in engineering, technology, applied science, and natural sciences.

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after World War II with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by industrialization. The world&#x27;s first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the University of Miskolc), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary (now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the Braunschweig University of Technology, founded in 1745 as &quot;Collegium Carolinum&quot;. The French &quot;École Polytechnique&quot; was founded in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey and Taiwan, institutes of technology are institutions of higher education and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the Istanbul Technical University, ETH Zurich, Delft University of Technology, RWTH Aachen and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology all considered universities.

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK, a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation). Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in STEM subjects from bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK Council for National Academic Awards. In 1992, UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK&#x27;s first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In Ireland the term &quot;institute of technology&quot; is the more favored synonym of a &quot;regional technical college&quot; though the latter is the legally correct term; however, Dublin Institute of Technology was a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law; Cork Institute of Technology and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master&#x27;s degree level—Level 9 of Ireland&#x27;s National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ)—for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others. In 2018, Ireland passed the Technological Universities Act, which allowed a number of Institutes of Technology to transform into Technological Universities.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history. In many cases, &quot;polytechnic&quot; were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an &quot;institute of technology&quot;. A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like &quot;institute of technology&quot;, &quot;polytechnic university&quot;, &quot;university of applied sciences&quot; or &quot;university of technology&quot; for marketing purposes. Such emergence of so many upgraded polytechnics, former vocational education and technical schools converted into more university-like institutions has caused concern where the lack of specialized intermediate technical professionals lead to industrial skill shortages in some fields, being also associated to an increase of the graduate unemployment rate. This is mostly the case in those countries, where the education system is not controlled by the state and any institution can grant degrees. Evidence have also shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate&#x27;s preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of that technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions. Mentz, Kotze and Van der Merwe argue that all the tools are in place to promote the debate on the place of technology in higher education in general and in universities of technology specifically and they posit several questions for the debate.

==Institutes by country==
===Argentina===
In Argentina, the main higher institution devoted to the study of technology is the National Technological University which has &quot;Regional Faculties&quot; throughout Argentina. The Buenos Aires Institute of Technology (ITBA) and Balseiro Institute are other recognized institutes of technology.

===Australia===
;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both vocational and higher education. They were part of the College of Advanced Education system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the Australian Technology Network a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded technical and further education (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the Melbourne Polytechnic rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE. These primarily offer vocational education, although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor&#x27;s degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In 2009, the old college system in Tasmania and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated universities of technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase &quot;university of technology&quot;, such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability – most important of all – to confer doctorates):
* Curtin University, Western Australia
* Queensland University of Technology, Queensland
* Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Victoria
* Swinburne University of Technology, Victoria
* University of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory
* University of South Australia, South Australia
* University of Technology Sydney, New South Wales

* Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt (Faculty of Technical Sciences founded 2007)

;Fachhochschulen
Fachhochschule is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 in Austria

In Belgium and in the Netherlands, &quot;Hogescholen&quot; or &quot;Hautes écoles&quot; (also translated into &quot;colleges&quot;, &quot;university colleges&quot; or &quot;universities of applied science&quot;) are applied institutes of higher education that do not award doctorates. They are generally limited to Bachelor-level education, with degrees called professional bachelors, and only minor Master&#x27;s programmes. The hogeschool thus has many similarities to the &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; in the German language areas and to the &quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot; in Finland. A list of all &quot;hogescholen&quot; in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found at the end of this list.

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, and institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to the bestowment of apprenticeships, citations, certificates, diplomas, and associate&#x27;s degrees upon successful completion. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions attached to a national university and offer select technical and engineering transfer programs. Colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes, and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity, or industry sources.

Some of Canada&#x27;s most well-known colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of Polytechnics Canada, a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), Diplomi-insinööri M.Sc. (Tech.), Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*Aalto University formed from Helsinki University of Technology and other universities
*Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. &quot;Ammattikorkeakoulu&quot; is the common term in Finland, as is the Swedish alternative &quot;yrkeshögskola&quot; – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance &quot;insinööri&quot;, engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor&#x27;s degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master&#x27;s degrees (Master of Engineering). After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term &quot;polytechnic&quot; to the term &quot;university of applied sciences&quot; in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the &quot;hogeschool&quot; in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences
*Lapland University of Applied Sciences
*Tampere University of Applied Sciences
*Turku University of Applied Sciences

A complete list may be found in List of polytechnics in Finland.

===France and Francophone regions===
;Instituts de Technologie (&quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;)
Collegiate universities grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French grandes écoles provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* Arts et Métiers ParisTech
* CentraleSupélec Graduate School
* Grenoble Institute of Technology
* Institut national des sciences appliquées
* Institut Supérieur de l&#x27;Aéronautique et de l&#x27;Espace
* Paris Institute of Technology
* ESTIA Institute of Technology
They provide science and technology master&#x27;s degrees and doctoral degrees.

;&quot;Universités de Technologie / Polytechs&quot;
The universities of technology () are public institutions awarding degrees and diplomas that are accredited by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. Although called &quot;universities&quot;, the universities of technology are in fact non-university institutes (&quot;écoles extérieures aux universités&quot;), as defined by Chapter I, Section II (Articles 34 through 36) of French law 84-52 of 26 January 1984 regarding higher education (the &quot;loi Savary&quot;).

They possess the advantage of combining all the assets of the engineering &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; and those of universities as they develop simultaneously and coherently three missions: Education, Research, Transfer of technology.
They maintain close links with the industrial world both on national and international levels and they are reputed for their ability to innovate, adapt and provide an education that matches the ever-changing demands of industry.

This network includes three institutions:
* The University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard (&quot;Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard&quot; or UTBM)
* The University of Technology of Compiègne (&quot;Université de Technologie de Compiègne&quot; or UTC)
* The University of Technology of Troyes (&quot;Université de Technologie de Troyes&quot; or UTT)

&#x27;Polytech institutes&#x27;, embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term &quot;haute école specialisée&quot; for a type of institution called &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French &quot;École polytechnique&quot;. Such terms include &quot;Écoles Polytechniques&quot; (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In French language, higher education refers to &quot;écoles polytechniques&quot;, providing science and engineering curricula:
* École polytechnique or X (near Paris)
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* École polytechnique de Montréal
* École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne
*National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine
*National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse

===Germany===
;Fachhochschule
 were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 in Germany. See the German Wikipedia for a list.

;Technische Universität

&quot;Technische Universität&quot; (abbreviation: &quot;TU&quot;) is the common term for universities of technology. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned &quot;Technische Universitäten&quot; in Germany have formed TU9 German Institutes of Technology as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with university hospitals (Klinikum Aachen, University Hospital Dresden, Rechts der Isar Hospital).

There are 20 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The three states of Bremen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein do not have a &quot;Technische Universität&quot;. Saxony and Lower Saxony have the highest counts of &quot;TUs&quot;, while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Greece===
Greece has Technical Universities (also known as Polytechnic Universities) with 5 years of study legally equivalent to Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree 300 ECTS, ISCED 7 and has the full professional rights of the Engineer. and had Technological Educational Institutes (TEIs) (1982–2019) also known as Higher Educational Institute of Technology, Technological Institute, Institute of Technology (provides at least 4-year undergraduate degree qualification πτυχίο, Latinised version: Ptychion, in line with the Bologna Process legally equivalent to Bachelor&#x27;s honours degree 240 ECTS, ISCED 6. Previously it was three and a half years studies from 1983 to 1995, 210 ECTS). All the Technical Universities and Technological Educational Institutes are Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with university title (UT) and degree awarding powers (DAPs). TEIs existed from 1983 to 2019; they were reformed between 2013 and 2019 and their departments incorporated into existing higher education institutions (HEIs).

The two Polytechnic Universities (Technical Universities) in Greece (Greek: Πολυτεχνείο) are the National Technical University of Athens and the Technical University of Crete. However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering that provides an equivalent diploma of engineerings with an integrated master and the full professional rights as well.

Many TEIs that got dismantled created engineering faculty with 5 years of study and 300 ECTS, ISCED 6. But those faculty are not under the general term of Polytechnics nor they have an integrated master&#x27;s degree yet waiting evaluation to be characterised as equivalent. These have been named School of Engineers for the time being and not Technical Universities or Polytechnic.

In Greece, all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are public university owned and government-funded, with free education undergraduate programmes that can be attended without any payment of tuition fee. About 1 out of 4 (one-fourth of) HEIs postgraduate programmes are offered free without any payment of tuition fee, especially about a 30% percentage of students can be entitled without tuition fee to attend all the HEIs statutory tuition fee postgraduate programmes after they be assessed on an individual basis of determined criteria as set out in the Ministry of Education.

===Hong Kong===
The first polytechnic in Hong Kong is The Hong Kong Polytechnic, established in 1972 through upgrading the Hong Kong Technical College (Government Trade School before 1947). The second polytechnic, the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, was founded in 1984. These polytechnics awards diplomas, higher diplomas, as well as academic degrees. Like the United Kingdom, the two polytechnics were granted university status in 1994 and renamed The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the City University of Hong Kong respectively. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, a university with a focus in applied science, engineering and business, was founded in 1991.

===Hungary===
The world&#x27;s first Institute of Technology the Berg-Schola (Bergschule) established in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary, by the Court Chamber of Vienna in 1735 providing Further education to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining. In 1762 the institute ranked up to be Academia providing Higher Education courses. After the Treaty of Trianon the institute had to be moved to Sopron.
* University of Miskolc re-established in 1949 as Technical University of Heavy Industry in Miskolc and in 1990 as University of Miskolc. The university is the successor of the University of Mining and Metallurgy of Selmecbánya (est. as Bergshule 1735).
* Budapest University of Technology and Economics, one of the oldest institute of technology of the world is located in Budapest (est. 1782). The BME was the first University in Europe to award engineering degrees.
* University of Debrecen – Faculty of Engineering
* University of Dunaújváros
* Pallasz Athéné University – GAMF

* University of Szeged – Faculty of Engineering
* Szent István University
* Széchenyi István University
* University of Pannonia
* University of Pécs – Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology
* Óbuda University

===India===
There are Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Information Technology, and National Institutes of Technology in India which are autonomous public institutions. These institutions are Institutes of National Importance, and hence each of the institutions are autonomous. All Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Information Technology, and National Institutes of Technology have their own councils which are headed by President of India. The activities of these institutions are generally governed by the institutes alone, but sometimes they are bound to follow the directives of Ministry of Education (India) and are answerable to Ministry of Education (India) and President of India. Some departments of some of these institutions are bound to follow certain guidelines of National Board of Accreditation (NBA) if they receive the accreditation from NBA. However, unlike other institutions, it is not mandatory for these institutes to follow guidelines of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and NBA completely.

The authority controlling technical education, other than the Institutes of National Importance, in India is All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

===Indonesia===
There are four public institutes of technology in Indonesia that are owned by the government of Indonesia. Other than that, there are hundreds of other institutes that are owned by private or other institutions.

Four public institutes are:
* Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung
* Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya
* Kalimantan Institute of Technology, Balikpapan
* Sumatera Institute of Technology, Bandar Lampung

Public state-owned polytechnics also available and provides vocational education offers either three-year Diploma degrees, which is similar to an associate degree or four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in applied sciences (). The more advanced vocational Master&#x27;s are also available and doctoral degrees are still in progress.

Some notable polytechnics in Indonesia includes State Polytechnic of Jakarta, State Polytechnic of Bandung, State Polytechnic of Malang, State Electronics Polytechnic of Surabaya, and State Naval and Shipbuilding Polytechnic of Surabaya. These polytechnics are known to be departed from Indonesian prestigious universities and institute of technologies, e.g. the State Polytechnic of Jakarta was departed from the University of Indonesia while both Surabaya Polytechnics were departed from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology.

===Ireland===
An &quot;Institute of Technology&quot; was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation IT is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and masters level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year Higher Certificate programme in various academic fields of study. Some institutions have &quot;delegated authority&quot; that allows them to make doctoral awards in their own name, after authorisation by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland.

Dublin Institute of Technology developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the University of Dublin it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member ofTU Dublin.

The approval of Ireland&#x27;s first Technological University, TU Dublin was announced in July 2018 and the new university established on 01 January 2019. It is the result of a merger of three of the ITs in the County Dublin area - Dublin Institute of Technology, IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown. Several Technological Universities have since been set up in the country. Munster TU was established 01 January 2021 through a merger of Cork IT and IT Tralee (Kerry). The Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest was the third such university, established in October 2021 out of Limerick IT and Athlone IT. The Atlantic Technological University was formally established on 01 April 2022 out of Galway-Mayo IT, IT Sligo, and Letterkenny IT. As a fifth such institution, the South East Technological University was established on 01 May 2022 out of Carlow IT and Waterford IT. As of May 2023, the only remaining Institutes of Technology in Ireland are Dundalk IT and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.

The Technological Higher Education Association is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.

===Israel===

===Italy===
In Italy, the term &quot;technical institute&quot; generally refers to a secondary school which offers a five-year course granting the access to the university system.

In higher education, &quot;Politecnico&quot; refers to a technical university awarding bachelor, master and PhD degrees in engineering. Historically there were two &quot;Politecnici&quot;, one in each of the two largest industrial cities of the north:
* Politecnico di Torino, established 1859;
* Politecnico di Milano, established 1863.
A third &quot;Politecnico&quot; was added in the south in 1990:
* Politecnico di Bari, established 1990.
In 2003 the Libera Università di Ancona becomes:

* Università Politecnica delle Marche (Polytechnic University of the Marches).

However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering.

In 2003, the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy) jointly established the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Italian Institute of Technology), headquartered in Genoa with 10 laboratories around Italy, which however focuses on research, not entirely in the fields of engineering and does not offer undergraduate degrees.

The first private technology university Macau University of Science and Technology is established in 2000. Macao Polytechnic Institute has renamed Macao Polytechnic University in 2022.

===Malaysia===
;Polytechnics
Polytechnics in Malaysia have been in operation since 1969. The institutions provide courses for bachelor&#x27;s degree &amp; Bachelor of Science (BSc), Advanced Diploma, Diploma and Special Skills Certificate. The first polytechnic in Malaysia, Politeknik Ungku Omar, was established by the Ministry of Education in 1969 with the help of UNESCO and the amount of RM24.5 million from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

At present, Malaysia has 36 polytechnics all over the country providing engineering, agriculture, commerce, hospitality and design courses.

The following is a list of the polytechnics in Malaysia in order of establishment:

;Technical University
There are four technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to Malaysian Technical University Network: 
*Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia
*Universiti Malaysia Perlis
*Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka
*Universiti Malaysia Pahang

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in Mauritius is the University of Technology, Mauritius with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country&#x27;s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===Mexico===
In Mexico there are different Institutes and Colleges of Technology. Most of them are public institutions.

The National Technological Institute of Mexico (in Spanish: , TecNM) is a Mexican public university system created on 23 July 2014 by presidential decree with the purpose to unify 263 public institutes of technology that had been created since 1948 and are found all around Mexico.

Another important institute of technology in Mexico is the National Polytechnic Institute (&quot;&quot;), which is located in the northern region of Mexico City.

===Moldova===

===New Zealand===
New Zealand polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with universities, colleges of education and wānanga; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of Tertiary Education Institutions. Some have officially taken the title &#x27;institute of technology&#x27; which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term &#x27;polytechnic&#x27;. One has opted for the name &#x27;Universal College of Learning&#x27; (UCOL) and another &#x27;Unitec New Zealand&#x27;. These are legal names but not recognized terms like &#x27;polytechnic&#x27; or &#x27;institute of technology&#x27;. Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand&#x27;s state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with Massey University. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the Waikato Institute of Technology, which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became Wellington Institute of Technology. Some smaller polytechnics in the North Island, such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with UCOL. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The Auckland University of Technology is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to university status; while Unitec has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

In mid-February 2019, the Minister of Education Minister Chris Hipkins proposed merging the country&#x27;s sixteen polytechnics into a &quot;NZ Institute of Skills and Technology&quot; in response to deficits and a decline in domestic enrollments. This was commenced with branding changes to 20 establishments in 2022 in preparation of their merger into Te Pūkenga

===Nigeria===
Virtually, every state in Nigeria has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In Rivers State for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic, Bori City and the Rivers State College of Arts and Science, Port Harcourt. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the NBTE in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the Eastern Polytechnic, established in 2008.

===Pakistan===
The polytechnic institutes in Pakistan offer Diploma in Engineering spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as Diploma of Associate Engineering (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the 10th grade standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and started in the early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can either get employment or enroll in Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) and Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree programs.

Universities of Engineering &amp; Technology in Pakistan offer undergraduate (BE/BS/BSc Engineering) and postgraduate (ME/MS/MSc Engineering and PhD) degree programs in engineering. BE/BS/BSc Engineering is a professional degree in Pakistan. It is a four-year full-time program after HSSC (higher secondary school certificate).

===Palestine===

===Portugal===
Till recently, there was a Technical University of Lisbon (UTL). It included several of the most prestigious schools, including, an engineering school (Instituto Superior Tecnico) and one of the most ancient business schools in the world (ISEG Lisbon). But UTL merged with the University of Lisbon. In this field, here are also a number of non-university higher educational institutions which are called polytechnic institutes since the 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US community colleges.

Since the implementation of Bologna Process in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master&#x27;s degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor () degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university&#x27;s licentiate degrees (&quot;&quot;). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

===Singapore===

Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s degrees or doctorate. However, Polytechnics in Singapore offer three-year diploma courses in fields ranging from applied sciences to business, information technology, humanities, social sciences, and other vocational fields such as engineering and nursing. There are five polytechnics in Singapore: Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic.

The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to an associate degree obtainable at the community colleges in the United States. A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is also known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to a local or overseas universities, depending on the university&#x27;s policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term &quot;institute of technology&quot;, most notably the Singapore Institute of Technology were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Other technological universities in Singapore includes the Nanyang Technological University and the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

===Slovakia===
*Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava
The world&#x27;s first institution of technology or technical university with tertiary technical education is the Banská Akadémia in Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia, founded in 1735, Academy since December 13, 1762 established by queen Maria Theresa in order to train specialists of silver and gold mining and metallurgy in neighbourhood. Teaching started in 1764. Later the department of Mathematics, Mechanics and Hydraulics and department of Forestry were settled.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, there was a division between universities and technikons (polytechnics), as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings.

By the mid-2000s, former technikons have either been merged with traditional universities to form comprehensive universities or have become universities of technology; however, the universities of technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a university (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).

===Taiwan===

The question of Taiwanese college education is, the students either from high school (the aims is to go to normal college) or tech high school(the aims is to go to work or technology university), almost all of the students take the same test(the score can go to two kinds of school), and the school would not care what kind of high school you are from.

===Thailand===
Most of Thailand&#x27;s institutes of technology were developed from technical colleges, in the past could not grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees; today, however, they are university level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the doctoral level. Examples are Pathumwan Institute of Technology (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology North Bangkok (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to &quot;University of Technology&quot;: Rajamangala University of Technology (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and King Mongkut&#x27;s University of Technology Thonburi (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are Asian Institute of Technology, which developed from SEATO Graduate School of Engineering and Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, an engineering school of Thammasat University. Suranaree University of Technology is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while Mahanakorn University of Technology is the most well known private technological institute. Technology/Technical colleges in Thailand is associated with bitter rivalries which erupts into frequent off-campus brawls and assassinations of students in public locations that has been going on for nearly a decade, with innocent bystanders also commonly among the injured and the military under martial law still unable to stop them from occurring.

===Turkey===


In Turkey, with historical roots extending back to the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul Technical University is recognized as the oldest technical university, established in 1773. Notably, Karadeniz Technical University in Trabzon was established in 1955. Middle East Technical University in Ankara followed closely, founded in 1956. More recent developments include the transformation of Yıldız University into Yıldız Technical University, along with the establishment of Gebze Technical University in Kocaeli, and İzmir Institute of Technology in İzmir. Additionally, the technical education landscape broadened with the founding of Bursa Technical University in Bursa in 2010.

===Ukraine===

===United Kingdom===
Institutes of Technology

The UK Government defines institutes of technology as &quot;Business-led Institutes of Technology [that] offer higher level technical education to help close skills gaps in key STEM areas&quot;. They deliver qualifications from level 3 (T-levels) to level 7 (master&#x27;s degrees). The government is investing £300 million in developing a network of 21 institutes of technology across England, with 19 open and two further institutes expected to open in September 2024.

Polytechnics

Polytechnics were tertiary education teaching institutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The comparable institutions in Scotland were collectively referred to as central institutions.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the binary system of education along with universities. Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, PhD) validated at the national level by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). Initially they concentrated on engineering and applied science degree courses and other STEM subjects similar to technological universities in the US and continental Europe. Polytechnics were associated with innovations including women&#x27;s studies, the academic study of communications and media, sandwich degrees and the rise of management and business studies.

Britain&#x27;s first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution later known as the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain &quot;at little expense&quot;. The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century. Most polytechnic institutes were established at the center of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation &quot;institute of technology&quot; was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), Central Institutions (Dundee, Robert Gordon&#x27;s) and for the Cranfield Institute of Technology (now Cranfield University), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two &quot;institutes of science and technology&quot;: UMIST and UWIST (part of the University of Wales). Loughborough University was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation. The University of Strathclyde was the Royal Technical College from 1912 to 1956 and then the Royal College of Science and Technology from 1956 until granted university status in 1964.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization. These institutions are sometimes referred to as post-1992 universities.

Technical colleges

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation college of advanced technology. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees.

Institutions called &quot;technical institutes&quot; or &quot;technical schools&quot; that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic. Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

===United States===

Polytechnic institutes in the USA are technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century. A handful of American universities include the phrases &quot;Institute of Technology&quot;, &quot;Polytechnic Institute&quot;, &quot;Polytechnic University&quot; or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally research-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. Conversely, schools dubbed &quot;technical colleges&quot; or &quot;technical institutes&quot; generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a community college level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution.

Some of America&#x27;s earliest institutes of technology include Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1824), Rochester Institute of Technology (1829), Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (1854), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1861), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1865).

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the &quot;polytechnic&quot; French concepts. At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound middle class economy.

Nowadays, most of the &quot;Institutos de Tecnología&quot; are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French &quot;Institut Universitaire de Technologie&quot;s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.

<text>USS &quot;Baya&quot; (SS/AGSS-318), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the baya. During World War II, she completed five war patrols in the South China Sea, Gulf of Siam, Java Sea, and Philippine Sea between 23 August 1944 and 25 July 1945. She sank four Japanese vessels totaling 8855 gross register tons, and shared credit with the submarine for sinking a Japanese 8,407-gross register ton passenger-cargo ship. After World War II, she saw service as a research submarine during the Cold War and operated off Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Baya&quot; was launched on 2 January 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. Charles C. Kirkpatrick, and commissioned on 20 May 1944.

==Service history==
=== World War II ===

Following a month of sea trials and training off the coast of New England, &quot;Baya&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 25 June 1944. As she proceeded via the Panama Canal to Hawaii, she continuously drilled and conducted exercises. She arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in August 1944 and carried out a final round of training there.

====First war patrol====
&quot;Baya&quot; embarked on her first war patrol on 23 August 1944, departing Pearl Harbor in company with the submarines and , with which she formed a coordinated attack group. After a brief stop at Saipan in the Mariana Islands for fuel, the three submarines proceeded to the Palau Islands, where they joined two other coordinated attack groups in intelligence-gathering missions in support of U.S. forces invading the islands. The reconnaissance group shifted position several times as it gathered information for Admiral William Halsey, Jr.&#x27;s United States Third Fleet, but for the submarines on patrol, it proved to be only a month of fighting heavy seas while not encountering any Japanese ships.

During the night of 25 September 1944, while patrolling in Luzon Strait, &quot;Baya&quot; submerged to avoid discovery by a Japanese airplane. She surfaced in rough seas about 30 minutes later. Her executive officer, engineering officer, and quartermaster were topside when a large wave crashed over &quot;Baya&quot;&#x27;s stern, washing the three men overboard and flooding &quot;Baya&quot; through the conning tower hatch. &quot;Baya&quot; sank to a depth of before the hatch was secured. Her crew, fortunately at battle stations already, drained the conning tower, surfaced, and recovered the men washed overboard within half an hour. Repairs took a few hours at most, and &quot;Baya&quot; soon returned to her patrol.

While prowling the South China Sea on 7 October 1944, &quot;Baya&quot; encountered the only significant contact of the patrol when her radar detected three Japanese ships, an 8,407-gross register ton passenger-cargo ship, later identified as &quot;Kinugasa Maru&quot;, accompanied by two escorts, part of Japanese convoy HI-77. &quot;Baya&quot; and &quot;Hawkbill&quot;, each aware of the other&#x27;s presence in the area but unaware that they are attacking the same ship, both joined in an attack on the merchant ship. &quot;Hawkbill&quot;′s first salvo of torpedoes missed, but &quot;Baya&quot;′s scored two hits. On her next try, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; also struck home with two torpedoes and, seconds later, &quot;Kinugasa Maru&quot; exploded and disappeared. On 9 October 1944, &quot;Baya&quot; departed the South China Sea and headed for Fremantle in Western Australia, where she arrived on 22 October 1944.

====Second war patrol====
After a short refit and training period, &quot;Baya&quot; got underway from Fremantle for her second war patrol, forming an attack group with the submarines and in the South China Sea. In four separate incidents between 8 and 10 December 1944, &quot;Baya&quot; made contact with three Japanese destroyers and a Japanese hospital ship but failed to achieve a suitable attack position on any of the destroyers, and the hospital ship enjoyed immunity from attack. After that series of contacts, &quot;Baya&quot; took station in a scouting line deployed off Mindoro in the Philippine Islands between 14 and 25 December 1944. While shifting to the west on 27 December 1944, &quot;Baya&quot; sighted a Japanese task force consisting of two heavy cruisers and four destroyers attempting to retreat from the Philippines. She closed for an attack and fired a full spread of torpedoes at the leading heavy cruiser, but scored no hits. Soon thereafter, she received orders to proceed to Australia, and she arrived at Fremantle on 12 January 1945.

====Third war patrol====
After refit alongside the submarine tender , &quot;Baya&quot; put to sea once again on 19 February 1945 for her third war patrol, this time in company with the submarine , and proceeded to a patrol area in the South China Sea off Cap Varella on the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina. The submarines sighted no significant targets until 4 March 1945, when the five-ship Japanese convoy HI-98, consisting of the tanker &quot;Palembang Mar&quot;u, a cargo ship, and three escorts, appeared on &quot;Baya&quot;′s radar scope. Numerous sailboats hampered &quot;Baya&quot; as she attempted to approach the targets, and a calm, moonlit sea gave the advantage to her adversaries. However, two of the six torpedoes that she fired struck &quot;Palembang Maru&quot;, which exploded in a tremendous blaze. Two others hit the cargo ship, but Baya could not determine the extent of damage she caused because the escorts drove her deep with depth charges.

&quot;Baya&quot; emerged from the encounter unscathed and then shifted her attention to the Camranh Bay area off French Indochina. Two hours before the start of the midwatch on 20 March 1945, she contacted a single Japanese ship, the auxiliary netlayer &quot;Kainan Maru&quot;, leaving Phan Rang Bay. Just after midnight, she fired a three-torpedo salvo from her stern torpedo tubes and scored one hit that sank &quot;Kainan Maru&quot;. Later that morning, &quot;Baya&quot; fired another stern tube salvo at a convoy of two escort destroyers and a submarine chaser leaving Phan Rang Bay, but her luck did not hold. Her torpedoes missed and she had to dive to avoid the resulting depth charge counterattack that shook her up. Ordered to the newly liberated Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines, &quot;Baya&quot; arrived there on 27 March 1945 for repairs and a refit alongside the submarine tender .

====Fourth war patrol====
&quot;Baya&quot; got underway with &quot;Cavalla&quot; on 20 April 1945 for her fourth war patrol, again assigned a patrol area off Camranh Bay, where, besides routine submerged patrolling, she and &quot;Cavalla&quot; were assigned lifeguard duties in support of air strikes against Saigon. On 29 April 1945, a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber which mistook her for a Japanese submarine dropped a bomb which exploded about ahead of &quot;Baya&quot; while &quot;Baya&quot; was operating approximately east-northeast of Pulo Cecil de Mer, French Indochina, at . &quot;Baya&quot; suffered no damage or casualties.

On 2 May 1945, &quot;Baya&quot; joined the submarine in the Gulf of Siam just north of Singapore. The next night, she began tracking a Japanese convoy made up of two gasoline tankers and two escorts. &quot;Baya&quot; maneuvered into position and fired her bow tubes, but the attack proved unsuccessful. The leading escort, a minelayer, gave chase, but &quot;Baya&quot; quickly eluded her pursuer. The following day, &quot;Baya&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Lagarto&quot; to plan a coordinated attack on the convoy. The convoy&#x27;s unusually alert escorts frustrated the efforts of the two submarines, and no opportunities for attack presented themselves that day. Early the next morning &quot;Lagarto&quot; tried to attack the convoy from a position away from &quot;Baya&quot;. Afterward, &quot;Baya&quot; attempted to contact &quot;Lagarto&quot; but her calls went unanswered. &quot;Lagarto&quot; was never heard from agan, and Japanese records indicated that the minelayer sank a submarine in that location at that time. &quot;Lagarto&quot; was lost with all hands.

&quot;Baya&quot; shifted her patrol to the Java Sea, where on 13 May 1945 off Rembang, Java, she attacked a three-ship convoy consisting of the tanker &quot;Yosei Maru&quot;, the tanker &quot;Enoshima Maru&quot; – which she misidentified as a cargo ship – and an escort bound for Palembang, Sumatra. She chose &quot;Yosei Maru&quot; as her first target and scored three hits with a spread of six torpedoes. She then aimed her stern tubes at the escort, and believed she scored two hits. To make a clean sweep, she fired her two remaining torpedoes at &quot;Enoshima Maru&quot; and retired, leaving &quot;Yosei Maru&quot; sinking and, her crew believed, the other two ships severely damaged. The guard boat &quot;No.17 Shonan Maru&quot; carried out an unsuccessful counterattack on &quot;Baya&quot;. Although &quot;Baya&quot; claimed to have sunk &quot;Enoshima Maru&quot;, the latter had, in fact, escaped unscathed. On 18 May 1945, &quot;Baya&quot; reached Fremantle for a refit alongside the submarine tender .

====Fifth war patrol====

A fire in the maneuvering room delayed the start of &quot;Baya&quot;′s fifth war patrol, but after the completion of repairs, she got underway on 20 June 1945. At the beginning of the patrol, she operated south of Cape Selatan in support of Allied landings at Balikpapan, Borneo. On 27 June 1945, she intercepted a single Japanese minelayer but her torpedoes missed. On 29 and 30 June 1945, &quot;Baya&quot; and the submarine conducted a coordinated gun attack on five Japanese small craft. Heavy return fire ended this engagement before &quot;Baya&quot; could add another sinking to her record.

Baya performed lifeguard duties in the Java Sea during the first half of July 1945 and then continued her patrol in that same area. On 16 July 1945, she torpedoed and sank the Japanese &quot;Ōtori&quot;-class torpedo boat , then en route from Surabaya, Java, to Ambon with two torpedoes; two officers, 22 men, and one civilian passenger who survived &quot;Kari&quot;′s sinking ultimately reached Masalamo Besar on 18 July. After an unsuccessful gun attack on another Japanese patrol craft, &quot;Baya&quot; received orders to proceed to Subic Bay on 26 July 1945. She reached Subic Bay on 31 July 1945 and moored alongside &quot;Anthedon&quot;. She was at Subic Bay when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945.

====End of war====

Two weeks after Japan&#x27;s capitulation, &quot;Baya&quot; departed Subic Bay bound for San Francisco, California, which she reached on 24 September 1945, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge as part of Admiral Halsey&#x27;s symbolic end-of-war parade. Shortly thereafter she began inactivation, remaining in the San Francisco area, and on 14 May 1946 she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Navy Yard at Mare Island, California.

=== Research submarine ===

&quot;Baya&quot; was converted to an electronics experimental submarine and recommissioned on 10 February 1948. All torpedo loading and stowage equipment was removed at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard to make room for Naval Electronics Laboratory (NEL) personnel and equipment. Reclassified as an auxiliary research submarine, AGSS-318, on 12 August 1949, &quot;Baya&quot; conducted experiments for NEL San Diego, California. She participated in local operations near San Diego and served with a joint American-Canadian task force gathering scientific data off western Canada in November and December 1948. During July–September 1949 she made a cruise to the Arctic to gather valuable scientific data in the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.

In April 1953, &quot;Baya&quot; began an overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and, upon completing it, resumed her duties in support of underwater electronics research, which occupied her throughout 1954 and for most of 1955. Between July and October 1955 she was deployed to Pearl Harbor for further experimental research. In December 1955 she commenced an overhaul at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco to update her capabilities for NEL testing. 

&quot;Baya&quot; was used as a testbed for two early sonar transducer arrays which markedly changed her appearance. The first arrangement of 196 transducers in a 14×14 array was attached to the former gun mount abaft the conning tower, facing starboard and surrounded by a fairwater resembling a second conning tower. She then operated from San Diego and Pearl Harbor for the rest of her career. She conducted a one-day cruise to film an episode of the 1958–1961 television show &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, starring Lloyd Bridges.

After the first array and fairwater were removed, &quot;Baya&quot; was completely reworked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard during 1958 and 1959 to test a second array, called LORAD (for &quot;LOng RAnge Detection&quot;). The forward torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by a blunt bow containing the forward-facing transducer array. A mushroom anchor was installed in the bottom of the hull; and a section was added between the former forward torpedo room and the forward battery compartment, with quarters for twelve scientists. These modifications increased her overall length to , and her submerged displacement to approximately 2,600 tons. Her maximum speed was reduced to .

&quot;Baya&quot; served in the Vietnam War zone for two months in 1966 in conjunction with sonar research operations for NEL and in submerged visibility studies for the Naval Oceanographic Office. In 1968, she commenced a series of tests for the Operational Test and Evaluation Force, Pacific, and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. In 1971, she performed research in the Gulf of Alaska before returning to San Diego in December 1971. In April 1972, she made one last cruise to Pearl Harbor to conduct sonar experiments before returning to San Diego.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Baya&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register on 30 October 1972. She was sold on 12 October 1973 for scrapping.

<doc id="1121036" wikidata="Q7658806" url="?curid=1121036" title="Swirl (band)">
<text>Swirl were an Australia indie rock band, forming in 1991 by Ben Aylward on guitar and vocals, David Lord on drums and Nicola Schultz on bass guitar and vocals. Schultz left in 1997 and was replaced by Richard Anderson on bass guitar and keyboards and Keira Hodgkison on guitar and vocals. They released three albums, &quot;Aurora&quot; (May 1992), &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (May 1994) and &quot;Light Fill My Room&quot; (July 2001), before breaking up in December 2002.

==History==

Swirl formed in Sydney in early 1991 as an indie guitar pop trio by Ben Aylward on guitar and vocals, David Lord on drums and Nicola Schultz on bass guitar and vocals. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as, &quot;[a] very prolific outfit, [their] brand of UK-inspired, noisy guitar pop stamped the band as a popular drawcard on the alternative scene.&quot; They recorded their first extended play, &quot;Swirl&quot; (December 1991), with two of its four tracks at Moonlight Studios (January to February) and the other two at Powerhouse Studios (March to May), Sydney.

Their debut album, &quot;Aurora&quot; (May 1992), was produced by label owner, Nic Dalton. It included some shoegazer elements, such as extensive use of guitar fuzz and reverb on vocals. Their second album, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, appeared in May 1994. Nicole Leedham of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; rated it at eight-out-of-ten and explained, &quot;[it] is a simple disc, a welcome relief from most of the over-produced pap that dominates much of the airwaves these days.&quot; McFarlane opined, &quot;[the tracks] ranged from soft, jangly moments (&#x27;Strangelands&#x27;) to bursts of sonic guitar squalls (&#x27;Dark Star&#x27;, &#x27;The Last Unicorn&#x27;).&quot; It went further into shoegazing territory, with layered, feedback-washed guitar solos and ambient instrumental tracks between songs; it also featured guest performances by Lara Goodridge, later of the FourPlay String Quartet on violin and Sarah Peet on cello.

In subsequent years Swirl released a few EPs and played live in Sydney, Melbourne and other Australian cities. They supported gigs by My Bloody Valentine and Ride on their respective tours of Australia. Schultz left in 1997 and was replaced by Richard Anderson on bass guitar and keyboards and Keira Hodgkison on guitar and vocals. In April 1999 the new line-up issued a single, &quot;Time&quot;, which Jasper Lee of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; observed was, &quot;one of the most uniquely brilliant singles of [that year]&quot; where they have &quot;remodelled themselves stylistically and musically.&quot;

During the year 2000, Hodgkison relocated to Melbourne to start at the Victorian College of the Arts, where she studied composition, however the group continued performing upon her periodic returns to Sydney. Swirl&#x27;s last studio album, &quot;Light Fill My Room&quot;, was released in July 2001 on independent record label, Um &amp; Ah; it had been recorded a few years earlier and was financed by Festival Mushroom Records, although that label dropped them and so its release was held up. Aylward described their moving labels, &quot;we were with Half a Cow for about seven years and it just got to the point where Roger Grierson wanted to sign us to Festival records, and we just thought it was the next step.&quot; He explained the delay in releasing the album, &quot;We just went through a lot of typical story record company stuff. We recorded this record about two years ago.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s associate at &quot;Oz Music Project&quot;, Michelle Ho felt, &quot;[they] have managed to develop their unique sound into something a little more solid, whilst maintaining their fairytale-like pop melodies and beautiful guitar riffs.&quot; She observed how their, &quot;delicate melodies will send your body into shivers of utter bliss, and Ben and Keira&#x27;s vocals are sublimely harmonious to the ears. Like an inspirational emotional roller coaster, it takes you up, down, around and back.&quot; &quot;Light Fill My Room&quot; was a more polished, radio-friendly affair; it had elements of Swirl&#x27;s shoegazing sound, but also ballads and even a children&#x27;s choir on one track. Swirl broke up in December 2002 as the members pursued other musical projects.

== Post break up ==

In 2010 Swirl released a digital double album of EP, b-sides and live tracks, &quot;Satellites (One)&quot; and &quot;Satellites (Two)&quot;. These were available via download through iTunes. The original Swirl line-up reunited in 2012 to play at Half a Cow Records tribute nights at the Lansdowne Hotel, Sydney in December of that year and the Tote in Collingwood in January of the following year.

<text>The International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) is a non-profit organization and non-governmental organization founded in 1919 that promotes biological sciences internationally. As a scientific umbrella organization, it was a founding member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).

== History ==

The Union was founded in 1919 following the work of the &quot;Conference of Allied Academies of Sciences&quot; held in Brussels. Originally, the &#x27;S&#x27; was not for &#x27;Science&#x27; but for &#x27;Societies&#x27;. After defining its constitution and organization in 1925, the IUBS adheres to the International Research Council (International Council for Science), which is now known as the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
From 1925 to 1939, the IUBS worked on two main themes: information science and environment. This second project resulted in the creation of the &quot;World Conservation Union&quot;.

== Networking and cooperation ==
The Union was a founding member of the ICSU Scientific Committee and works closely with UNESCO. It also maintains relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It cooperates with the European Commission and numerous other organizations, agencies, and foundations.

== Organisation ==

The Union currently consists of:
* 44 national members, consisting of national science academies, research and scientific organizations; and
* 80 scientific members, including international scientific associations, societies or commissions of the various biological disciplines, from biology to zoology. New members are allowed under strict scientific guidelines.

The national and the academic members bring areas of biological science to the attention of the Union. The Union then reviews the members&#x27; suggestions. Approval is given in the General Assembly and the project progresses through conferences and then implementation through funding agencies.

=== Board ===
The Executive Committee consists of: the President, the former president, two Vice-Presidents, the Secretary, the Treasurer and other members of the Extended Board. The Board meets annually. The Secretariat, with its Executive Director coordinates the programs and activities.

=== General Assembly ===
In the General Assembly, each national member has one vote. The scientific members are invited to send one representative each to the talks and make programmatic proposals. The General Assembly elects the Executive Board for the proposed projects, selects the scientific programs of the Union, reviews the progress of scientific programs, collaborates with other international organizations and decides on the allocation of funding. The General Assembly takes place in parallel to a scientific conference, organized in cooperation with the National Union Committee of the host country.

== Programmes ==
The scientific programmes of the General Assembly are approved in accordance with the Statutes of the Union.

=== Examples of programmes ===
Diversitas, Human Dimensions of Biodiversity, Climate Change Integrative Biology (ICCB), Systematics Agenda, Biological Education (BioED), IUBS Bioethics Ethics Committee earlier, Bionomenclature, Biology and Traditional Knowledge, Biological Consequences of Global Change (BCGC) Darwin200, Biosystematics, Species 2000, Genomics and Evolution, Modernizing the codes to meet future needs of scientific communities (Biocode), Biology Research and Education Resources in Africa, Reproductive Biology, Aquaculture, Bio-Energy and Towards an Integrative Biology (TAIB), Global Species List Working Group (GSLWG).

== Publications ==
The institution publishes four times a year &quot;Biology International&quot; and other publications such as the &quot;IUBS Monograph Series&quot;, &quot;Methodology Manual Series&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings of the IUBS General Assemblies&quot;.

<text>Daniel Huntington (October 4, 1816April 19, 1906) was an American artist who belonged to the art movement known as the Hudson River School and later became a prominent portrait painter.

==Early life==
Huntington was born in New York City, New York on October 4, 1816. He was the son of Benjamin Huntington, Jr. and Faith (née Trumbull) Huntington. His paternal grandfather was Benjamin Huntington, delegate at the Second Continental Congress and first U.S. Representative from Connecticut. His maternal grandfather was Jedediah Huntington (1743–1818) of Norwich, Connecticut, who served as a General in the American Revolutionary War.

He studied at Yale with Samuel F.B. Morse, and later with Henry Inman. From 1833 to 1835, he transferred to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he met Charles Loring Elliott, who encouraged him to become an artist.

==Career==
Huntington first exhibited his work at the National Academy of Design in 1836. Subsequently, he painted some landscapes in the tradition of the Hudson River School. Huntington made several trips to Europe, the first in 1839 traveling to England, Rome, Florence and Paris with his friend and pupil Henry Peters Gray. On his return to America in 1840, he painted his allegorical painting &quot;Mercy&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which brought him fame and confirmed his interest in inspirational subjects. He also painted portraits and began the illustration of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. In 1844, he went back to Rome.

Returning to New York around 1846, he devoted his time chiefly to portrait-painting, although he painted many genre, religious and historical subjects. From 1851 to 1859, he was in England. He was president of the National Academy of Design from 1862 to 1870, and again in 1877–1890. He was also vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.


==Personal life==
Huntington was married to Harriet Sophia Richards (1821–1893), a daughter of Charles H. Richards and Sarah (née Hayward) Richards. Together, they were the parents of Charles Richards Huntington (1847–1915), a merchant. He was the brother-in-law of fellow painter Cornelius Ver Bryck.

Huntington died in New York City on April 19, 1906. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<doc id="1121047" wikidata="Q749420" url="?curid=1121047" title="Monsters of Rock">
<text>Monsters of Rock was a hard rock and heavy metal music festival. It was originally held annually in Castle Donington, England, from 1980 to 1996, taking place every year except 1989 and 1993. It later branched into other locations such as the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the United States, and Russia.

==History==
In 1980, promoter Paul Loasby, along with Maurice Jones, planned a one-day festival dedicated specifically for bands within the hard rock and heavy metal genre. Loasby was an established and successful promoter working that year on the Rainbow UK tour and penned the festival as the final show of the tour for the band to headline. Jones knew the owner of the Donington Park race track, Tom Wheatcroft, located next to the village of Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England, and the site was chosen to host the event.

(A year earlier, promoter Bill Graham’s July 1979 Day on the Green Festival at Oakland Coliseum in California was also dubbed &quot;The Monsters of Rock&quot; show. This concert featured Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and AC/DC.)

Donington Park was unknown as a major location but its location in the East Midlands next to the M1 and A42 allowed for better transportation to the site from around the country. Additionally, the site ground level sloped which allowed for a better viewing for the audience throughout the site.

The first Monsters of Rock line-up consisted of a mix of British and international bands. The event was a success with 35,000 heavy metal fans attending. Although only conceived as a one-off event, it was mentioned on the day the idea that the festival will return the following year and the first edition birthed what would become a regular festival for the next 15 years, becoming synonymous as a Mecca for fans of the genre and further establishing the Midlands as the home of heavy metal.

Over the years, the attendance continued to grow, reaching 107,000 in 1988–where two fans died during the Guns N&#x27; Roses set. The blame was initially accounted to the large size of the crowd and a rush forward during the band&#x27;s set. But it was officially declared that the cause was laid on the weather, causing muddy and wet conditions on the sloping ground. As a result, the festival did not take place in 1989, and it was replaced that year by a two-day festival similar to Monsters of Rock, the Moscow Music Peace Festival in Soviet Union, which included performances by several Monsters of Rock veterans Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe and Scorpions. Monsters of Rock returned the year after with a limitation to the crowd of 75,000.

The festival had been held in parallel in West Germany from 1983 to 1991. In 1984 and 1986 the festival branched into Sweden. In 1988, the festival occurred for the first time in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. It was held as a one-time event in 1991 in Russia (one of the largest concerts of all time, with an estimated audience of over 1.6 million), Poland, Belgium, Hungary. In 1994, the festival was exported overseas to Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

In 1993 the &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; radio show debuted in the United States with host Harlan Hendrickson. Guests on the show include everyone from AC/DC, KISS, Van Halen, Judas Priest, Motörhead, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, Bon Jovi, Cheap Trick, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Dio, Y&amp;T, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Slayer and Poison.

The Monsters of Rock festival continued on as the premier hard rock and heavy metal event in Great Britain in the 1990s but started to fall upon hard times as heavy metal became less popular, with another cancellation in 1993 due to being unable to find a strong enough headliner. In 1995 the festival found itself in a similar situation until Metallica agreed to play with the condition of the band having control over the event and naming it &quot;Escape from the Studio&quot;. In 1996 Ozzy Osbourne and KISS co-headlined the festival and although there were plans to extend the festival into a two-day event in 1997, the promoters once again found themselves in a struggle for headliners and the event was cancelled and discontinued.

Donington Park remained event-less until 2001 when the Rock and Blues Festival and Stereophonics held events at the site. In 2002 the Ozzfest tour returned to the UK using Donington Park as their only British event and the following year Live Nation picked up the reins as Monsters of Rock&#x27;s successor in the name of Download Festival. An outstanding success from the offset, the festival continues to this day having increased to a three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event has been relegated outside of the track.

In 2006, the Monsters of Rock name was revived and held at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes, England, for a one-off event headlined by Deep Purple and with Alice Cooper as a special guest.

In 2012 Harlan Hendrickson &amp; Monsters of Rock Worldwide partnered with Larry Morand and Mike London to launch the inaugural Monsters Of Rock Cruise.

In 1993, the Monsters of Rock radio show debuted. Harlan Hendrickson, host and creator of the Monsters of Rock, broadcasts from the rock radio station WRIF in Detroit. The Monsters of Rock is currently syndicated nationally/internationally through United Stations Radio Networks where it currently airs in over 60 markets in the United States alone.

Guests on the show have included of AC/DC, Kiss, Van Halen, Motörhead, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, Bon Jovi, Cheap Trick, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Slayer and Poison.

In 1994, Beavis and Butt-Head episode &quot;Take a Number&quot;, Beavis and Butt-Head attempt to get tickets to &quot;Creatures of Rock&quot; which is a parody of &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot;

In the 2005 Half Man Half Biscuit song &quot;Mate of the Bloke&quot; on their album &quot;Achtung Bono&quot;, the protagonist sings of legal action taken against him by More O&#x27;Ferrall for spraying the legend &quot;in church hall if wet&quot; onto a billboard for &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot;.

In 2012, Harlan Hendrickson teamed up with Larry Morand and Mike London to launch the &quot;Monsters of Rock Cruise&quot;, which is a multi day music cruise celebrating the Castle Donington festival. Artists such as Saxon, UFO, Cinderella, Tesla, The Quireboys and others from the original festival have been featured on the cruise.

<text>Philip Repyngdon ( – 1424) was a bishop and cardinal.

==Life==
It is believed Repyngdon was born in Wales in around 1345. He became an Augustinian canon, first at Repton Abbey, then at Leicester Abbey where he was ordained to the priesthood on 26 May 1369. He was educated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, graduating with a Doctorate of Divinity in 1382.

A man of some learning, Repyngdon came to the front as a defender of the doctrines taught by John Wycliffe; for this he was suspended and afterwards excommunicated, but in a short time he was pardoned and restored by Archbishop William Courtenay, and he appears to have completely abandoned his unorthodox opinions.

In 1394, Repyngdon was made abbot of the abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis at Leicester, and after the accession of Henry IV to the English throne in 1399 he became chaplain and confessor to this king, being described as &quot;clericus specialissimus domini regis Henrici&quot;.

On 19 November 1404, Repyngdon was chosen bishop of Lincoln, and was consecrated on 29 March 1405. In 1408, Pope Gregory XII created him a cardinal, however, it was not recognised in England, and the creation was revoked in 1409. He resigned his bishopric on 20 November 1419. Some of Repyngdon&#x27;s sermons are in manuscript at Oxford and at Cambridge.

In 1405, Repyngdon attempted to promote a pilgrimage site at Yarborough devoted to the Blessed Sacrament, after the church there was destroyed by fire. The pyx which contained the consecrated Host was the only thing to survive the fire, and the bishop attempted to establish a cult centre there, but it failed.

<doc id="1121115" wikidata="Q7170520" url="?curid=1121115" title="Personal Jukebox">
<text>The Personal Jukebox (also known as &quot;PJB-100&quot; or &quot;Music Compressor&quot;) was the first consumer hard drive-based digital audio player. Introduced in 1999, it preceded the Apple iPod, SanDisk Sansa, and other similar players. It was designed and developed by Compaq Research (SRC and PAAD groups) starting in May 1998. Compaq did not release the player themselves, but licensed the design to HanGo Electronics Co., Ltd. of South Korea.

Compaq Research published a software development kit for the unit, which enabled users to develop tools, drivers and applications for different operating systems.
==History==

===Development===
The PJB was created as a personal audio appliance prototype by DEC Systems Research Center and Palo Alto Advanced Development group (PAAD). The project started in May 1998, a month before the Digital Equipment Corporation merger into Compaq was completed, and a final product was brought to market in November 1999. The PJB was the first hard-disk-based MP3 player made available on the market.

The &quot;100&quot; in the &quot;PJB-100&quot; name was chosen from the capacity of the original 4.86 GB hard drive in the first Personal Jukebox. With this drive, the unit was expected to hold about 100 popular (45 minute) music CDs encoded at 128 kbit/s. The name was kept for the later models with bigger hard drives, even though these could store a larger number of albums.

The PJB-100 was the first MP3 portable to garner a &quot;Milestone&quot; product designation from MP3 Newswire, which they defined in their January 2000 review of the PJB-100 as &quot;any product whose breakthrough innovations are so significant, they influence the future course of its industry&quot;.

===Licensing, marketing and distribution===
Instead of manufacturing the player themselves, Compaq licensed the design to HanGo, which called it the &quot;Personal Jukebox - PJB-100&quot;. The license from Compaq to HanGo was worldwide exclusive - nobody else could license the technology from Compaq during the term of the HanGo license. HanGo granted a distribution agreement to US company Hy-Tek Manufacturing of Sugar Grove, IL in 2001. HanGo rebranded the units sold through Hy-Tek as the &quot;Compressor&quot;.

HanGo took the PJB-100 into mass production and introduced it to the public at the Las Vegas COMDEX in November 1999. The first units were sold in a special auction held by MP3.com, with bids exceeding US$1000. Some winners received their players before the end of 1999. The first auctioned units were hand-built by the Compaq engineers who designed it and had single-digit serial numbers.

==Hardware==

===Digital signal processor (DSP)===
The heart of the PJB is its Digital Signal Processor. It controls the hard-drive, buttons, LCD, USB interface and handles MP3-decoding for playback. The PJB uses a 24-bit Motorola 56309 DSP running at 33 MHz. The MP3 codec (which is about 2 MB in assembly DSP code) was licensed from Thomson and Fraunhofer IIS.

===Memory===
The PJB has 12 MB of DRAM and 1 MB of flash memory.

The DRAM is used to buffer data (between 8 and 12 minutes of music, depending on the bitrate used for encoding) from the hard disk during playback. The buffer allows the disk to be run only intermittently, preserving battery life. When the hard-disk is stopped, battery life is preserved; the ramp-loaded heads also retract from the disk surface, helping to reduce the possibility of damage.

The flash memory houses the firmware as well as the bootstrap.

===Communication interface===
To transfer data, the PJB is equipped with a USB 1.1 Type B connector. Inside is a Philips PDIUSBD12 USB peripheral controller, which averages a raw throughput of about 400 kB/s. Early prototypes used Ethernet instead of USB for data transmission. USB was used in production models because it was more common than Ethernet on standard home computers in 1998.

===Display===
The PJB&#x27;s LCD has a resolution of 128×64 pixels (2:1 ratio) at a diameter of 3 inches (76.2 mm). Later versions of the PJB also featured a backlit display (the backlight comes on when the unit is powered on, or a button is pressed and turns off automatically after a few seconds). The character set the PJB uses internally is Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), with some minor variations. One of the Compaq developers stated that &quot;it&#x27;s missing some of the symbols in the range 160 to 255 (because I got bored when I was creating them :-). Upper case accented characters are rendered unaccented because that looks better within the font&#x27;s 9-pixel height. There are some glyphs in the range 0 to 31, used for the symbols on the screen.

===Hard drive===
While flash players could store between 32 and a maximum of 128 MB at the time, the first PJB could store 4.86 GB of music. While the PJB-100 was updated as bigger drives became available, it was also possible for end users to replace the hard drive (although voiding the warranty in that case).

===Buttons/controls===
The PJB has 6 buttons on the front:
* Left/Previous/Rewind
* Right/Next/Forward
* Up
* Down
* Play/Pause
* Stop/Power off

Volume is adjusted by a wheel on the unit&#x27;s right side, using a digital mechanism (it can be turned indefinitely). It also is possible to click or push the wheel, which pauses playback and turns the unit off after about one minute. When the unit is powered off and the wheel is pressed for a few seconds, playback resumes. This also works when the buttons are locked, in case the main controls cannot be easily accessed.

On the same side is also a small switch which locks the unit’s controls (except for the wheel).

===Battery and power supply===
The PJB is not powered by dry cell batteries like most other players at the time of its development, but by a provided HanGo Lithium ion battery. HanGo sold a more powerful 1600 mA battery to be used in the PJB.

The PJB includes a 5 V power supply which charges the battery and enables playback without a battery in the unit at all. The charging control circuit for the battery is built into the PJB itself, not the power supply, so the use of a replacement power supply requires only the proper voltage and sufficient current capacity.

==Accessories==

===Included accessories===
Compared to other players, the PJB included accessories. Details varied from distributor to distributor, but UHU/Portacomp AG included:
* Koss Porta Pro headphones
* Leather case with belt clip
* 5 V power supply with converters for European and American power outlets (except UK)
* 1350 mW/3.6 V Li-ion battery (see the battery section)
* USB 1.1 compliant A-B connector cable
* Cinch-Audio cable 3.5 mm to RCA
* Manual (in German and English)
* CD with drivers and Jukebox Manager software (Windows, Mac OS/OS X, Linux)

===Optional accessories===
Accessories were offered by distributors (among them headphones and speakers, also for use with other audio hardware than the PJB and replacements for the included accessories):
* 1600 mAh Li-ion battery
* Waterproof neoprene bag for use of the PJB at a beach or pool
* Audio-cassette adapter for playback on car/home stereos
* Swan-neck car-holder
* Magnetic mounts to attach the PJB within a car
* Power-supply-adapters for car cigarette-lighters

==Firmware==

===Features and version history===
The latest firmware version, which surfaced in December 2003, is v2.3.3-alpha; the latest stable version is v2.3.2, introduced in mid-2001. Initially, the functions provided by the player were basic: when music was played back, selecting another track would immediately start this track and stop the current one; playlists had to be created on the computer; files could only be uploaded to the PJB, but not downloaded back to the computer. New firmware versions came out regularly, but were mostly bug fixes with very few new functions introduced.

Later firmware versions added some of the most requested features:
* Files could be transferred from player to PC
* The ability to browse without interrupting playback
* Some (hidden) games were added

===File system and table of contents (TOC)===
The PJB&#x27;s disk is not formatted as FAT or FAT32 as is the case with most of the players that were released later, and enables those to be mounted as another drive in an operating system. Instead, a unique file system is used, which, while losing the mounting ability, is optimized for the structure of MP3 files (having a cluster size of 128 kB, which equals about 8 seconds of 128-kBit-encoded MP3-music). Therefore, managing actions like defragging become unnecessary. The file system allows the linking of Tracks into various Discs/Sets. Therefore, each track is ideally only stored once on the disc and recurring occurrences of it (for example in playlists or samplers) are just links to the original file. This may help to preserve a good amount of disk space and allows for more tracks to be stored on the disk.

All of this info is stored in the TOC (table of contents). The TOC is stored in a human-readable text-format and can be downloaded, changed with a text editor and re-uploaded to the PJB again. A copy of the TOC is always stored on the unit as well, so errors and damage to the original TOC can usually be fixed.

==Software==
===Software development kit===
The original developers at Compaq Research designed an SDK (Software Development Kit) for the unit and published it open source under the GNU General Public License in 2000.

===Drivers===
The PJB does not integrate itself as a USB mass storage device into modern operating systems. Special drivers are required to make the operating system recognize an attached PJB. Drivers for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS were included, while drivers for Linux were developed by the open source community.

===Jukebox Manager (Windows, Mac OS)===
The included management tool for the PJB is the Jukebox Manager (the latest Windows version is v1.5.6). It can create/delete/manage Sets, Discs and Tracks (when uploading, the user can choose which ID3-tag will represent which level). It can also encode CDs directly onto the PJB and query the CDDB for the proper disc/track information. Finally, it can update the firmware. If manipulating some values in the Windows Registry, a hidden menu appears, which can be used to debug and, in some cases repair a damaged TOC. The Jukebox Manager does not make use of some of the firmware’s later features, such as downloading tracks back to the computer and does not provide advanced features such as mass-uploading, synchronizing or creating playlists from M3U-playlists.

===Linux projects===
There are Linux projects operating on SourceForge (some under the banner of the OpenPJB project). These range from Jukebox-Manager-like applications with a GUI for various window managers to projects making the PJB&#x27;s file system mountable as a drive in Linux. Some of the projects include:
* Jukebox Manager (KDE)
* GNOME/GTK+ GUI Personal Jukebox Manager (GNOME)
* Emacs PJB Manager
* PJB File System for Linux (Kernel 2.3/4, 2.6)
* PJB VFS module (for use with Nautilus)
* pjmirror (written in Perl to synchronize the PJB with data on the PC)

<text>Eliphalet Nott (June 25, 1773January 25, 1866), was a famed Presbyterian minister, inventor, educational pioneer, and long-term president of Union College, Schenectady, New York.

==Early life==
Nott was born at Ashford, Connecticut, on June 25, 1773. He was the second son, and youngest of nine children, born to Stephen Nott and Deborah (née Selden) Nott.
In 1795, he earned a degree from Rhode Island College (which later became known as Brown University).

==Career==

Around 1802, he was called to the Presbyterian Church at Albany, where he took a prominent position as a preacher and was heard by large congregations. Among his successful pulpit efforts at Albany was a sermon on the death of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, entitled &quot;On the Death of Hamilton&quot;, condemning the practice of dueling, that had profound influence in curtailing the custom and remains recognized to this day as an exemplary period example of the orator&#x27;s art.

===College presidency===
In 1804, at the age of 31, Nott became president of Union College, a role he served in until his death in 1866, during which time more than 4,000 students are estimated to have graduated from Union. He also served as president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from 1829 to 1845, where he &quot;visited the school at least every third week and was compensated with one dollar per visit plus all graduation fees.&quot;

Upon assuming the presidency of Union, he reportedly found the College financially embarrassed and successfully worked to place it on sound footings. In the early 1830s, after the founding of the Union Triad fraternities, Nott called for the dissolution of all fraternities. He was dissuaded from this by a member of Delta Phi named John Jay Hyde.

In 1805, the College of New Jersey conferred upon him the title of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity), and in 1828, he received the title of LL.D. His publications include collections of sermons, &quot;Counsels to Young Men&quot; (1810), and &quot;Lectures on Temperance&quot; (1847). In 1814, Nott was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. A number of imprints authored by Nott, or related to him in some way, reside in the society&#x27;s collections.

===Inventor and real estate investor===
As a scientist, he studied heat and obtaining some thirty or more patents for applications of heat to steam engines, but was best known in his day as the inventor of the first stove for anthracite coal, which was named for him.

Nott was an important land speculator and developer, partnering with his nephew Henry Sheldon Anable, buying several farms on the Long Island shore of the East River that became the sites of industrial enterprises.

==Personal life==
He married Sarah Marie &quot;Sally&quot; Benedict (1774–1804), the daughter of Rev. Joel Benedict of Plainfield, Connecticut, under whose instruction in early life he pursued his classical and mathematical studies. Before Sally&#x27;s death at the age of 29 on March 10, 1804, they were the parents of:

* Joel Benedict Nott (1797-1878), who married Margaret Taylor Cooper. Parents of Charles C. Nott.
* Sarah Marie Nott (1799–1839), who married Bishop Alonzo Potter, brother of Bishop Horatio Potter.
* John Nott (1801–1878), who married Mary Ann Lawrence (1824–1911) in 1830.
* Benjamin Nott (1802–1881), who married Elizabeth Cooper (1808–1867).

In 1807, he married Gertrude Peebles Tibbits (1771–1841), who died in January 1841.

In 1842, a year and a half after the death of his second wife, Nott married the much younger Urania Elizabeth Sheldon (1806–1886), a Troy Female Seminary graduate who was a well-known superintendent of several women&#x27;s schools and the leader of several local benevolent associations.

Beginning in 1860, Nott suffered a series of strokes while serving as president. He died on January 25, 1866, in Schenectady, New York, and was buried at the Vale Cemetery in Schenectady. His widow died on April 19, 1886, at age 80.

===Legacy===

The Nott Memorial, a centerpiece of the Union College&#x27;s campus, was built by his grandson, and Union graduate, Edward Tuckerman Potter and named in Nott&#x27;s honor.

Nott Road in Rexford, New York, the location of his farm, is named for him, as are Nott Street and Nott Terrace, which border Union College in Schenectady, New York. He remains the longest serving college president in the United States to this day.

<text>Abbott Vaughn Meader (March 20, 1936 – October 29, 2004) was an American comedian, impersonator, musician, and film actor.

Meader began his career as a musician but later found fame in the early 1960s after the release of the 1962 comedy record &quot;The First Family&quot;, written and produced by Bob Booker and Earle Doud. The album spoofed President John F. Kennedy – who was played by Meader – and became the fastest selling &quot;pre-Beatles&quot; album in history and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. At the peak of his popularity, he performed his Kennedy impersonation on television variety shows and in nightclubs around the country and was profiled in several magazines and newspapers.

Meader&#x27;s career success came to an abrupt end after President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963. Meader&#x27;s TV and nightclub bookings were all canceled. Producer Bob Booker quickly pulled &quot;The First Family&quot; records from stores so as not to appear to be profiting from the deceased President. Meader attempted to take his career in a different direction by performing non-Kennedy-related comedy and released a new comedy album, &quot;Have Some Nuts!!!&quot;, in early 1964. However, sales for the album were low as public interest in Meader had waned. His career never rebounded as he was too closely associated with President Kennedy. Meader eventually returned to his native Maine where he resumed performing music and managed a pub.

==Early life==
Meader was born in Waterville, Maine during one of the worst floods ever to hit New England: he often said he was born on &quot;the night the West Bridge washed out&quot;. He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five but she suffered from alcoholism, and placed him in a children&#x27;s home.

After shuttling among several schools in Massachusetts and Maine, Meader eventually graduated from Brookline High School in 1953. He enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed in Mannheim, West Germany as a laboratory technician. He formed a country music band – the Rhine Rangers – with fellow soldiers, later adding impressions of popular singers to his repertoire. Meader married the German-born Vera Heller in 1955.

==Career==
Meader began his career in entertainment as a singer and piano player. Upon his return from Germany, he began a comedy act in New York City, where he discovered his skill at impersonating Kennedy. With his New England accent naturally close to Kennedy&#x27;s familiar, and often parodied, Harvard accent, he needed to adjust his voice only slightly to sound like the President. Meader also mastered the facial expressions that allowed him to bear a passable resemblance to Kennedy.

===&quot;The First Family&quot;===

On October 22, 1962, Meader joined writers Bob Booker and Earle Doud and a small cast of entertainers to record &quot;The First Family&quot;. The album poked fun at Kennedy&#x27;s PT-109 history; the rocking chairs he used for his back pain; the Kennedy family&#x27;s well-known athleticism, football games and family togetherness; children in the White House; and Jackie Kennedy&#x27;s soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the Executive Mansion. &quot;The First Family&quot; became the fastest-selling record in the history of the United States. It sold 1.2 million copies during the first two weeks of its release, and ultimately sold 7.5 million copies.

Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, &quot;Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.&quot; At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced &quot;annoyment or enjoyment.&quot; He jokingly responded, &quot;I listened to Mr. Meader&#x27;s record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me. So, now &quot;he&#x27;s&quot; annoyed.&quot; Kennedy told Benjamin Bradlee that &quot;parts of it were amusing.&quot; Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves&#x27; &quot;A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy&quot;, state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television. It was the parodies of their children Caroline and John Jr. that Mrs. Kennedy was most upset about.

Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; and &quot;Hootenanny&quot;. Meader also made a couple of game show appearances, first as a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; on December 30, 1962, The following week, Meader and Naomi Brossart (who played Jackie Kennedy on the &quot;First Family&quot; albums) appeared on &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; in which the panel had to guess who the real Naomi Brossart was amongst the three lady contestants.

Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful (&quot;Billboard &quot; reported that he &quot;bombed&quot; in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia), he still played to packed houses in Las Vegas. &quot;The First Family&quot; won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, &quot;The First Family Volume Two&quot;, a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President&#x27;s family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

In July 1963, Meader left Cadence Records and Booker/Dowd to sign with MGM Records. Meader planned to record general satire and abandon his JFK impersonations.

===Assassination aftermath===
In November 1963, Meader was busy recording a new comedy record, written by a different group of writers and not involving his Kennedy impersonation. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, effectively ending Meader&#x27;s career. Copies of &quot;The First Family&quot; were pulled from stores and a JFK-related Christmas single by Meader (&quot;St. Nick Visits The White House&quot; b/w &quot;T&#x27;was The Night Before Christmas 1963&quot;) that had been released by MGM&#x27;s Verve Records shortly before the assassination was quickly withdrawn. Appearances that were already booked were cancelled, including one for the Grammy Awards ceremony. An episode of &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, which Meader filmed one week before the assassination and was set to air in February 1964, was pulled from the lineup. The episode never aired and was reportedly destroyed.

Meader reportedly first learned of President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination after hailing a taxicab in Milwaukee. The driver, recognizing his celebrity passenger, asked &quot;Did you hear about Kennedy in Dallas?&quot; Meader thought the driver was telling a joke and responded &quot;No, how does it go?&quot; The driver then informed Meader of President Kennedy&#x27;s death. Meader then heard the breaking news bulletins over the taxi&#x27;s radio.

According to several sources, stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce went on with his November 22 nightclub show as scheduled. Just hours after Kennedy&#x27;s death, Bruce walked onstage, stood silently for several moments, then said, &quot;Boy, is Vaughn Meader fucked.&quot; The joke proved true; Meader discovered that he was so completely typecast as a Kennedy impersonator that few were willing to hire him for any of his other talents. When he called them out, he was indirectly blacklisted in retaliation.

His non-Kennedy album for Verve Records, &quot;Have Some Nuts!!!&quot;, came out to minimal attention in early 1964. A similar follow-up, &quot;If The Shoe Fits...&quot; was released in late 1964, and included sketches on almost everything except the Kennedys, but sales were meager at best. Meader&#x27;s income evaporated, new-found friends and associates stopped calling, and by 1965 Meader was virtually broke. Sinking into depression, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs, and was forced to take whatever work he could find.

He reunited with Earle Doud in 1971 for an album called &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, a comedic look at what life would be like for Jesus if he had returned to Earth around the time of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, but airplay and sales were virtually nonexistent.

==Later years==

Meader tried several times to revive his career, but achieved only moderate success, and even then mostly outside of show business. He appeared briefly in the 1975 movie &quot;Linda Lovelace for President&quot;, portrayed Walter Winchell in the 1975 film &quot;Lepke&quot; starring Tony Curtis, and had a very brief cameo on the 1981 Rich Little comedy album &quot;The First Family Rides Again&quot;, which both parodied Ronald Reagan and paid homage to the original &quot;First Family&quot; album. Both the Kennedy and Reagan &quot;First Family&quot; albums were produced by Earle Doud.

Eventually, Meader resumed a career in bluegrass and country music, becoming a popular local performer in his native Maine. During the mid-1970s, he performed in Louisville, Kentucky, mostly at a small tavern known as the Storefront Congregation, under the name &quot;Abbott Meader and the Honky-Tonk Angels.&quot; Meader sang and played piano.

==Personal life and death==
Meader was married four times. He married his fourth wife, Sheila Colbath, in 1984. They remained married until his death.

Sheila was a caller on the NPR radio show &quot;Car Talk&quot; in 1992, where she mentioned that her husband was running for president. She questioned the hosts about a particular car, which she and Vaughn were considering taking on the campaign trail. Her call has been replayed as part of episode #2234 on the &quot;Car Talk&quot; podcast.

On October 29, 2004, Meader died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the age of 68.

==Legacy==
Meader has been posthumously credited for having broken new ground in the area of political humor, particularly in impersonations of the President of the United States.

In July 2006, nearly two years after Meader&#x27;s death, the independent documentary &quot;First Impersonator&quot; premiered at the Maine International Film Festival in Waterville, Maine, Meader&#x27;s birth town. The film chronicled Meader&#x27;s life and death, his rise to fame and equally famous fall from it, and his influence on today&#x27;s political impersonators.

<doc id="1121142" wikidata="Q880762" url="?curid=1121142" title="Blackburn Ripon">
<text>The Blackburn T.5 Ripon was a carrier-based torpedo bomber and reconnaissance biplane designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Blackburn Aircraft. It was the basis for both the license-produced Mitsubishi B2M and the improved Blackburn Baffin.

The Ripon was designed as a successor to the Blackburn Dart torpedo bomber as well as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft to fulfil Air Ministry Specification 21/23. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 17 April 1926, it was subsequently redesigned with a more effective engine installation, an enlarged rudder and increased wing sweepback. It was originally ordered into production for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), which primarily operated the type as a torpedo bomber.

The Ripon was operated by the FAA between 1930 and 1935, after which point it was withdrawn in favour of the Blackburn Baffin, which was an improved derivative of the Ripon. It was also produced overseas in Finland; many of the Ripons in service with the Finnish Air Force saw extensive use in both the Winter War and the Continuation War, typically flying nighttime reconnaissance missions.

==Development==
===Background===
The origins of the Ripon can be traced back to the mid-1920s and the issuing of Air Ministry Specification 21/23, which sought a replacement for the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s (FAA) single-seat Dart that could operate both as a torpedo bomber and a reconnaissance aircraft. It was stipulated that it should have a two-man crew, comprising a pilot and navigator/gunner to facilitate long-range reconnaissance missions; for the same reason, the aircraft was to have a maximum endurance of at least 12 hours. A further requirement was that it should have an interchangeable undercarriage between wheeled and float-equipped configurations, facilitating its operation from both land and sea.

Blackburn begin work on its response to the specification during 1925, directed by F. A. Bumpus. The resulting aircraft, which was designed around the Napier Lion V engine, drew heavily on the preceding Blackburn Velos coastal defence seaplane, having a broadly similar structure with the exception of its use of single-bay wings and the anhedral on the bottom central section. The lower mainplane was of a slightly larger span than the lower, while an atypical feature in the form of a lower wing root fairing. A single Lewis gun fitted on a rotating mounting around the rear cockpit formed the defensive armament. Offensive armaments consisted of six 230lb bombs, or three 520lb bombs, or a single 18-inch torpedo.

A pair of prototypes were built. On 17 April 1926, the first prototype made its maiden flight in a landplane configuration, flown by P. W. S. Bulman. On 26 August of that year, the second prototype made its first flight as a seaplane, piloted by J. D. Rennie. During December 1926, the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe commenced a formal evaluation of the aircraft. Initial trials against its competitors, the Handley Page Harrow and the Avro Buffalo, showed that none of the competitors were adequate, so the Ripon was redesigned with an improved engine installation, an enlarged rudder and increased sweepback on the wings. The revised aircraft was evaluated and declared to be the winner, after which Blackburn was awarded a production contract for the type.

===Into production===
The first production aircraft made its first flight in late 1927. Referred to as the &quot;Ripon II&quot;, design changes from the prototypes gave it a distinctly different appearance, such as its more pointy nose as a consequence of the new cowling and retractable radiators for engine cooling. The undercarriage had been drastically redesigned as well, featuring telescopic oleo struts fitted to the outboard ends of the bottoms centre front spar. Structurally the aircraft was largely unchanged and continued to conform with established Blackburn practices of the era, The gun ring was redesigned for a lower positioning, along with a slot in the rear decking for it to be locked into when not in use; the cockpit was also extended rearwards to house more apparatus.

On 15 May 1928, the first production aircraft made its public debut, performing a flying demonstration that included a practice torpedo deployment over the Humber along with some aerobatic manoeuvres in front of the assembled press. During 1928 and 1929, Blackburn received contracts for a combined 20 Ripon IIs. In early 1930, more substantial orders for 40 of the improved &quot;Ripon IIA&quot; were placed; this variant made greater use of duralumin in its wings and provided a mildly raised all-up weight. The production rate reached two aircraft per week around this time, which was facilitated by the subcontracting of some component manufacturing to the competing British aviation manufacturer Boulton Paul Aircraft.

Between 1931 and 1932, 31 &quot;Ripon IIC&quot;s were constructed, which had greater sweepback and eliminated all use of wood present in the structure of the mainplane. Many of the earlier production aircraft were rebuilt to the Ripon IIC standard during the early 1930s. It was the final production standard of the Ripon to be procured by a domestic air service. Instead, the Ripon served as the basis for the Baffin, which was effectively more advanced version of the type. Starting in January 1934, the Baffin begun to replace its predecessor in FAA service. Many of the Ripons were returned to Blackburn and remanufactured into Baffins.

In addition to the British armed forces, Blackburn had extensive efforts to promote the Ripon to potential overseas customers. These efforts involved explorations of its reengining with BMW and Hispano-Suiza powerplants, largely due to the later models of the Napier Lion engine being still on the official secrets list at that time. The Spanish Navy was one of the company&#x27;s acknowledged targets. During August 1928, an order for a single pattern aircraft was issued by Finland; this aircraft, designated &quot;T.5D&quot;, was outfitted with a Bristol Jupiter radial engine and an interchangeable undercarriage and delivered to the Finnish Air Force on 29 September 1929. Finland also purchased a license to produce the Ripon from Blackburn.

==Operational history==
During 1929, the Ripon entered service with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), six being operated by No 462 (Fleet Torpedo Bomber) Flight aboard in January of that year. During early 1931, five aircraft were conveyed by the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; to Argentina for use as demonstration aircraft for the British Empire Exhibition in Buenos Aires held in March of that year. Numerous close formation flights were performed by the service&#x27;s Ripons while off the coast of South America.

In FAA service, it was normally operated in a landplane configuration from the navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers; although it was capable of being converted to a seaplane, it was rarely fitted with floats in practice. The Ripon continued in service with Torpedo Bomber flights until 1933, when the Fleet Air Arm was reorganised into three larger squadrons, No. 810, No. 811 and No. 812. During January 1935, the last of the FAA&#x27;s Ripons were withdrawn from service when 811 Naval Air Squadron re-equipped with the more capable Baffin.

The Ripon was also operated by the Finnish Air Force; a single example was produced by Blackburn, while 25 further aircraft were produced under licence at the Finnish Aircraft Factory. These were powered with a number of different radial engines; the pattern aircraft had a 530 hp (400 kW) Bristol Jupiter VII, the next seven had 480 hp (360 kW) Gnome Rhone Jupiter VI, followed by eight series II aircraft with 535 hp (399 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Panther engines and of the ten III series aircraft, first nine had a 580 hp (430 kW) Bristol Pegasus engine, and the last one was equipped with a 650 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr. Finnish Ripons were typically stationed at Turkinsaari, Sortavala, and the island of Santahamina.

The Finnish Air Force deployed its Ripons on active combat missions against the forces of the Soviet Union during both the Winter War and the Continuation War. After the loss of one aircraft to Soviet fighters during late 1939, the Ripon was restricted to normally flying night missions only. It performed a diverse range of missions, including routine reconnaissance flights, U-boat patrols, casualty evacuation, leaflet dropping, and aerial supply operations. On 15 December 1944, the final aircraft was struck off, the Finnish stock having shrunk to a single operational Ripon due to many others having been cannibalised for parts. 

A single Ripon, &quot;RI-140&quot;, was stored and then reassembled and put on display in the Päijänne Tavastia Aviation Museum. It is the only preserved example.

<text>William Watkiss Lloyd (11 March 1813 – 22 December 1893) was an English writer with wide interests. These included fine art, architecture, archaeology, Shakespeare, and classical and modern languages and literature.

==Life==
Lloyd was born at Homerton, then in Middlesex, and educated at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School. At the age of 15 he entered a family tobacco business in London, where he remained until his retirement in 1864. In 1868 he married Ellen Brooker Beale (died 1900). He died in London.

==Works==
The work for which Lloyd is best known is &quot;The Age of Pericles&quot; (1875), which is notable for its scholarship and appreciation of its period, but hampered by a difficult and at times obscure style. He also wrote:
*&quot;Xanthian Marbles&quot; (1845)
*&quot;Critical Essays upon Shakespeare&#x27;s Plays&quot; (1875)
*&quot;Christianity in the Cartoons [of Raphael]&quot; (1865), which excited considerable attention from the way in which theological questions were discussed.
*&quot;The History of Sicily to the Athenian War with elucidations of the Sicilian odes of Pindar&quot; (1872)
*&quot;Panics and their Panaceas&quot; (1869)
*An edition of &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot;, &quot;now first published in fully recovered metrical form&quot; (1884) – the author held that all the plays were originally written throughout in blank verse.

A number of his manuscripts remain unpublished. The most important of these were bequeathed to the British Museum, including:
*&quot;A Further History of Greece&quot;
*&quot;The Century of Michaelangelo&quot;
*&quot;The Neo-Platonists&quot;
These are discussed in a &quot;Memoir&quot; by Sophia Beale, prefixed to Lloyd&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Elijah Fenton: his Poetry and Friends&quot; (1894), which contains a list of his published and unpublished works.

<doc id="1121160" wikidata="Q5598949" url="?curid=1121160" title="Great Chalfield Manor">
<text>Great Chalfield Manor is an English country house at Great Chalfield, about northeast of the town of Bradford on Avon in the west of the county of Wiltshire.

== History ==
Nikolaus Pevsner describes Great Chalfield as &quot;one of the most perfect examples of the late medieval English manor house&quot;.

The moated manor house was built around 1465–1480 for Thomas Tropenell, a modest member of the landed gentry who made a fortune as a clothier. It is on the site of an earlier fortified house, of which traces remain: the bases of curtain walls to the east and north, and parts of two towers.

The independent hall, lit on both sides, is flanked by unusually symmetrical gabled cross wings, with oriel windows and lower gabled porches in the inner corners, in the north-facing former entrance court, for which the richest effects were reserved. Its external symmetry, unusual for its date, is superficial. The intimately connected parish church, largely rebuilt by Tropenell, also faces into the court, which was formerly entered obliquely through a gatehouse in the west wing; Nicholas Cooper observes of the church that &quot;the probable need to pass through the house&#x27;s forecourt in order to reach it neatly demonstrates the community of secular and religious authority&quot;. Part of a moat survives, but the forecourt has been opened up to the outside in a manner that changes its original inward-facing aspect.
The house passed into the Eyre family by the marriage of Ann Tropenell to John Eyre of Wedhampton in 1550. It passed down in the Eyre family for three generations until 1631 when Sir John Eyre sold it to Sir Richard Gurney, 1st Baronet, Lord Mayor of London. It afterwards passed via Thomas and William Hanham, John Hall of Bradford and Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull to Robert Neale.

The house was altered substantially (with some of the original character lost) after the Neale family commissioned the architect Thomas Larkins Walker, a pupil of Augustus Pugin, to carry out a detailed survey of the manor in 1836; though his restoration proposals of 1837 were never carried out, the house was reduced and in particular, the great hall, adapted as a farmhouse, lost its ornate ceiling, with only one of the original bosses surviving.
Externally there is a garden with four &quot;tree houses&quot;, groups of four clipped yews that have grown together and been hollowed out inside to allow one to walk through.

== 20th century and today ==
The house and garden were purchased by George Fuller (of Neston Park) in the early 1900s, and restored and furnished between 1905 and 1911 by his fourth son, Major Robert Fuller, under the guidance of Sir Harold Brakspear. The restoration included a sympathetic garden design by Alfred Parsons.

Robert Fuller gave the house and nine acres of land to the National Trust in 1943, and it is open to the public. Robert Floyd, grandson of Robert Fuller, and his family live here and manage the property for the Trust. Tours of the house are at fixed times and visitors are escorted by a guide.
The house is Grade I listed; the &quot;Tropenell Cartulary&quot; manuscript, compiled for Thomas Tropenell, is still kept there. The barn northwest of the house, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, is also Grade I listed, while the gardens are Grade II listed.

== Church ==

All Saints&#x27; Church, near the front of the house, is a small church dating from the 14th century. It is Great Chalfield&#x27;s parish church, although the civil parish was amalgamated into the newly created parish of Atworth in 1884.

A chapel at Great Chalfield was first mentioned in 1316; in 1428 it was a church with fewer than ten parishioners. The present church was built c. 1480 by Thomas Tropenell and the surviving features from that time include the south chapel, the small square bellcote and the roof of the nave. Robert Neale carried out improvements in 1775 which included the addition of a family chapel, now used as a vestry, to the east of the south chapel. Several windows are from the 19th century and further restoration was undertaken in 1914. The font is 13th century and the pulpit 17th.

Church registers survive from 1605. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1962. Today the church is part of the benefice of Broughton Gifford, Great Chalfield &amp; Holt.

<text>Béarn (; ; or &quot;Biarn&quot;; or &quot;Biarno&quot;; or &quot;Bearnia&quot;) is one of the traditional provinces of France, located in the Pyrenees mountains and in the plain at their feet, in Southwestern France. Along with the three Basque provinces of Soule, Lower Navarre and Labourd, the Principality of Bidache, as well as small parts of Gascony, it forms the current Pyrénées-Atlantiques department. The capitals of Béarn were successively Beneharnum (until 841), Morlaàs (from 1100), Orthez (from the second half of the 13th century) and then Pau (beginning in the mid-15th century).

Béarn is bordered by the Basque provinces of Soule and Lower Navarre to the west, Gascony (Landes and Armagnac) to the north, Bigorre to the east, in addition to Spain (Aragon) to the south.

Today, the mainstays of the Béarn area are the petroleum industry, the aerospace industry through the helicopter turboshaft engine manufacturer Turbomeca, tourism and agriculture (much of which involves maize (corn) grown for seed). Pau was the birthplace of Elf Aquitaine, which has now become a part of the Total S.A. petroleum company.

In the eastern part of the province are two small exclaves belonging to Bigorre. They are the result of how early Béarn grew to its traditional boundaries: some old lesser viscounties were added by marriage, and absorbed into Béarn: Oloron to the south/southwest ca. 1050, Montanérès in the east in 1085, and Dax in the west in 1194. When Montanérès was added, five communities or parishes (Villenave-près-Béarn, Escaunets, Séron, Gardères, and Luquet) did not form part of the dowry; they remained, or became, part of Bigorre. Their attachment to Bigorre continues to the present, as they followed it into Hautes-Pyrénées, rather than being incorporated into the surrounding Pyrénées-Atlantiques.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===

The name Béarn derives from &quot;Beneharnum&quot;, the capital city of the ancient Venarni people, which was destroyed by Vikings by 840. The modern town of Lescar is built on the site of Beneharnum.

=== Prehistory ===
Agriculture and metallurgy were first practiced in the region around 4,000 years ago. Many dolmens, tumuli and megaliths have been found in Béarn dating to this era, suggesting that ancestor worship was an important religious activity in neolithic Béarn. Construction of cromlêhs in Béarn continued into the Bronze Age.

Fortified villages were also constructed in Neolithic Béarn, and remains of these have been found near Asson, Bougarber and Lacq.

=== Antiquity ===
During the Iron Age, Béarn was a part of ancient Aquitania, where the proto-Basque people lived. The Benearni, from whom the name Bearn derives, were one of these people.

The region became part of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. Diocletian included Bearn in the Roman province of Novempopulania. Roman influence in the region waned in the fifth century AD, and Béarn experienced multiple barbarian invasions. Béarn was successively conquered by the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Merovingians and finally the Carolingians.

The fifth century AD also saw the arrival of Christianity in Béarn. The rural character of Béarn meant that Christianity took longer to become established there than elsewhere in France.

=== Middle Ages ===

The Vascons settled on the land between the Garonne and the Pyrenees, which the Franks had conquered from the Visigoths, and from the 6th century onwards controlled this territory; a duchy of Vasconia (then Gascony) was formed. In the 7th century, Odon had a large kingdom stretching from the Pyrenees to the Loire with Toulouse as its capital. The language commonly spoken by the Vascons was Aquitanian, although its area of influence continued to decline with the increasing Romanisation of the region from the 1st century BC. The Duchy of Gascony became fragmented from the 9th century onwards, allowing the creation of the Viscounty of Bearn. The people of Béarn thus organised themselves for the first time in an entity of their own. The first reigning dynasty was the Centulle family. It was also at this time, around the 8th or 9th century, that Beneharnum was devastated by the Normans. Morlaàs then became the new capital of a nascent principality. The Centulle allowed the primitive Béarn to extend to the south and east, and several marriages led to the integration of the viscounty of Oloron around 1050 and then that of Montaner in 1085. The county of Orthez was annexed in 1194 under the Moncade dynasty, and all these territories together formed the historic Béarn, which kept its borders intact until the Revolution.

Béarn was included in the original borders given to the Frankish kingdom by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, but the creation of a political entity of their own led to an evolution of this vassalage link. Thus, the gradual accession of Bearn to a de facto sovereignty status is the major theme of this medieval period. From the 11th to the 14th century, Béarn was tossed between the zones of influence of the Dukes of Gascony, the Kings of Aragon, the Kings of England and the Kings of France. Béarn remained under the control of the dukes of Gascony after its division in the 9th century, and this link was already very weak in the second half of the 11th century. Vassalage was only theoretical under Gaston IV the Crusader, who took part in the first crusade and the Reconquista. He played a decisive role alongside Alfonso I of Aragon. Bearn became the ally of Aragon, breaking the last links with Gascony. This alliance was initially balanced, but the union of Aragon with Catalonia in 1137 broke this balance in favour of Aragon. Béarn became a vassal county of the Aragonese crown, which tried to create a vast ensemble on both sides of the Pyrenees.

In 1213, the Aragonese defeat at the battle of Muret led to the end of Aragonese interventions in the region. The ties of vassalage between Béarn and Aragon were gradually weakened and then broken, without any clashes, during the first half of the 13th century. This rupture was the occasion for the kings of England to demand the return of Bearn to the Gascon fold. In spite of his desire of independence, Gaston VII pays homage to the king of England in 1240. The return of Béarn to the Gascon sphere of influence is also reflected by a change of capital, Orthez (closer to Gascony) replaces Morlaàs in 1242. Gaston VII will not, in spite of everything, cease to revolt against this intrusion in the affairs of a country which previously had a very broad autonomy. He had to admit defeat after being taken prisoner at Winchester by Edward I of England in 1276.

=== A sovereign principality ===
Gaston VII chose to marry his second daughter, Marguerite de Béarn, to the Count of Foix, Roger-Bernard III. This marriage provoked the indissoluble union between the houses of Foix and Béarn. The new Foix-Béarn were in a delicate situation, with Béarn on the one hand a vassal of the kings of England, and Foix a vassal of the kings of France. The beginnings of the future Hundred Years&#x27; War between the two kingdoms were already coming, complicating the balance within this new dynasty even more. Until Gaston II of Foix-Béarn, the position of the sovereigns of Béarn oscillated between neutrality and following the French positions (without paying tribute). The people of Bearn were reluctant to follow a policy favourable to the kings of France, they felt that they belonged to the Gascon community and saw the kingdom of France as a foreign land. It was not until Gaston III, known as Fébus, that a new policy appeared: to make Bearn a sovereign and neutral country.

Fébus&#x27; project was the culmination of the long periods of autonomy experienced by Béarn in previous eras. Now in the midst of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Fébus took advantage of the French rout of Crécy in 1346 to distance himself from the kingdom of France. On 25 September 1347, he declared to an envoy of Philip VI that Bearn was a land that he &quot;had from God and from no man in the world&quot;, an act considered to be a declaration of independence. Subsequently, he avoided French reprisals with the disaster of the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. Fébus also managed to ward off English intentions for Bearn. To do this, he faced the Black Prince, who claimed Bearn as a prince of Aquitaine. After the French and English failures to obtain a tribute, the autonomous viscounty becomes a de facto sovereign principality. The viscounts gave up this title to present themselves as lords of the sovereign country of Bearn. When Fébus died without an heir, the principality reverted to the House of Grailly. In 1434, Gaston IV married the Infanta Eleanor of Navarre and became crown prince of the kingdom of Navarre, transferring his court from Orthez to Pau in 1464.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Béarn is served by two autoroutes. The A64 (&quot;l&#x27;autoroute pyrénéenne&quot;, European designation E80) was built in 1977 and links Pau, Toulouse and Bayonne. In Béarn, the A64 has junctions serving the towns of Salies-de-Béarn, Orthez, Artix, Pau and Soumoulou.

The A65 (&quot;l&#x27;autoroute de Gascogne&quot;, European designation E7) links Pau with Langon. It serves the Béarnese towns of Lescar, Thèze and Garlin. At Langon, the A65 joins on to the A62, which continues to Bordeaux. The A65 was opened in 2010, and was at the time France&#x27;s most expensive autoroute.

Several more minor routes also serve Béarn. The Route Nationale 134 links the south of Pau with Somport in the Aspe Valley. Several mountain roads link Somport with Spain.

=== Rail ===
Three railway lines serve Béarn. The first of these is the Toulouse to Bayonne railway, which was opened in stages between 1861 and 1867. Several rail stations are located on this line, including those of Coarraze-Nay, Assat, Pau, Artix, Orthez and Puyoô. The Puyoô to Dax railway line enables trains to run from Béarn to Bordeaux. Both these railway lines are served by TGV, Intercités and TER.

The third railway line, the Pau to Canfranc line, serves the south of Béarn. It was put into service between 1883 and 1928. However, the railway line been partially closed since 1970. This is because in 1970, a bridge carrying this rail line over the Gave d&#x27;Aspe was destroyed by a train derailment; SNCF consequently closed the line south of the Gare d&#x27;Oloron-Sainte-Marie. An additional section of the line, between Oloron-Sainte-Marie and Bedous, was reopened by SNCF in 2016.

Canfranc Railway Station is located within Spain and is also served by the Spanish Jaca to Canfranc railway. International rail transport between Béarn and Aragon was thus previously possible using this route. In 2013, the regional governments of Aragon and Aquitaine agreed to take steps to further the economic links between their two regions, including possibly reopening the Pau-Canfranc railway line all the way to Canfranc Station. The two governments hope to have the line fully reopened by 2020.

A fourth railway line once linked Puyoô rail station to that of Mauléon-Licharre. This line opened in two stages between 1884 and 1887; it was closed to passengers in 1968 and to freight in 1989. The line was officially abandoned in 1991. A branch of this line ran from Autevielle to Saint-Palais. This branch is also now closed.

=== Aviation ===

Pau Pyrénées Airport, situated near Uzein, has direct flights to Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport (9 flights in total to Paris daily), Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport (3 flights daily) and Marseille Provence Airport. During summer, it also has flights to Bastia – Poretta Airport, Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport, Naples International Airport and Bari Karol Wojtyła Airport. 634,000 passengers used Pau Pyrénées Airport in 2015, making it the third busiest airport in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine région of France, after Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport and Biarritz Pays Basque Airport.

Béarn has a long association with aviation. The meteorological conditions of Béarn were convenient for early aviators, and the Wright brothers made several flights in Pont-Long, a flat marshy area north of Pau from 1908 onwards. Wilbur Wright helped set up the world&#x27;s first aviation school, which opened outside Pau in 1908. Pau Pyrénées Airport is located on the site of this aviation school. The French military trains its paratroopers at the School of Airborne Troops, which has been located near Pau since 1946.

<text>Archbishop Andronik (also spelled Andronic; , secular name Vladimir Alexandrovich Nikolsky, ; August 1, 1870 – July 7, 1918), was a bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church and a saint, glorified as [[Hieromartyr]] Andronik, Archbishop Of Perm in 2000.

== Early life ==
Archbishop Andronik was born as Vladimir Nikolsky, on August 1, 1870, in Povodnevo, a village in Myshkinsky Uyezd, Yaroslavl diocese. His father was a deacon in the Russian Orthodox Church. After he finished his studies at the Yaroslavl Seminary in 1891, he entered the Moscow Theological Academy. On August 1, 1893, during his studies in Moscow, he was tonsured a monk and given the religious name of Andronik. He was ordained to the diaconate on August 6 of that same year. On July 22, 1895, he was ordained as a priest.

== Russian Orthodox Church ==
From 1895, Andronik was assigned first to the theological seminary of Kutaisi in Georgia and then at the seminary at Ardon as inspector and instructor.

=== Bishop of Kyoto ===
In 1897, Andronik was assigned as a member of the Russian Orthodox mission to the Empire of Japan, under Bishop Nikolai (Kasatkin), later glorified as St. Nicholas of Japan, to assist him in his missionary work, which he began 1861. Hieromonk Andronik was very surprised by this assignment and felt inadequate for the position, but ultimately he accepted it as God&#x27;s will. His journey began in St. Petersburg, on September 21, 1897, and continued from Odessa with Archimandrite Sergius (Stragorodsky) on October 26. Traveling through European countries and the United States, they arrived in Japan on December 26. He wrote and published a book about this journey, &quot;A Missionary Journey to Japan&quot; (published in Kazan, Russia in 1899).

On November 5, 1906, Andronik was consecrated as the first Bishop of Kyoto, which became the seat of the West Japan Diocese of the Japanese Orthodox Church. Although Bishop Andronik was the bishop of Kyoto, he lived in Osaka which, while it then was the second largest city in Japan, was also where most of Orthodox faithful lived. After he arrived in Osaka, he began to feel ill and found performing his duties difficult. After serving in Osaka for three months, he asked leave to resign and to depart from Japan. On May 27, 1907, he left Japan and returned to Russia. There, he was assigned on October 26 to be the deputy to Bishop Eulogius of Kholm. In 1908, he was assigned bishop of Tikhvin in Novgorod diocese.

=== Bishop of Perm and Solokamsk ===
On July 30, 1914, Andronik was appointed bishop of Perm and Solikamsk. Eleven days before, on July 19, World War I began. As the war progressed, he worked energetically for one and a half million inhabitants and 570 churches in this region.

In summer 1916, Andronik traveled to the Imperial Russian Army headquarters outside St. Petersburg where Tsar Nicholas II was leading the army. The purpose of this trip was to warn the Tsar about Rasputin. However, the Tsar would not take him seriously and his trip failed. But Nicholas II was pleased with the gift Bishop Andronik gave him on behalf of the people, a pair of soldier&#x27;s boots that the province of Perm provided the army.

== Bolshevik Revolution ==
In 1917, Andronik became Bishop of Perm and Kungur, and became one of the seven hierarchs in the pre-conciliar synod preparing for the Local Council of the Russian Church in Moscow. He was very active throughout the council, from August 1917 until April 1918, which was the end of the second session of the Council. As the agitation of the Bolshevik take-over intensified on January 25, 1918, Bishop Adronik made a written appeal to the faithful to defend the heritage of the Church from the aggressors and looters as attacks became more frequent.

Andronik was a firm supporter of the Tsar. From his point of view, it was God&#x27;s will that the anointed Tsar should reign over the empire; hence, the monarchy was an appropriate governmental system for Christians. But this did not mean he supported tyranny: the Tsar should listen to his people, and the monarch and the people should come to peace.

In February, in the Perm region, the Bolsheviks began to loot churches and monasteries. When the second session of the Council ended, Andronic returned to Perm. Patriarch Tikhon had elevated him to archbishop on April 25, Palm Sunday. On Holy Thursday, April 16, the Bolsheviks carried out a search of his residence. He remained calm and continued the services of Holy Week and Pascha (Easter).

The Bolshevik authorities increased pressure on the church in the following weeks. Finally Archbishop Andronik was arrested at midnight on July 4 (Gregorian calendar: July 17). In response, the clergy in Perm went on strike from the night he was arrested until July 13 (Gregorian: July 26), halting all divine services in the region except baptism and the last rites for the dying. There are various accounts of his death. The apparently most consistent says that on July 7, 1918, he was taken to the forest and forced to dig his own grave. After lying down in it, he was covered with earth and shots were fired into the dirt.

In 2000, the Russian Orthodox Church glorified him as Hieromartyr Andronik, Archbishop Of Perm, one of the Russian New Martyrs and Confessors. His feast day is July 7 on the Julian Calendar (Gregorian Calendar: July 20).

<text>William Laurence Brown (7 January 175511 May 1830) was a Scottish minister.

==Life==

Brown was born in Utrecht in the Netherlands. His father, William Brown, was minister of the English church there, but was then appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at St Andrews, and therefore returned to Scotland in 1757. Brown went to the grammar school there, and then to the university, graduating MA in 1772. After passing through the divinity classes, in 1774 he went to the University of Utrecht, where he studied theology and civil law.

He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of St Andrews in October 1777 and he was appointed minister the Scots Church in Utrecht in place of his uncle Robert Brown in January 1778. The University awarded him a Doctor of Divinity in 1784. In 1788 he was appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy and Law of Nations (International Law) at the University of Utrecht. To this was added the professorship of the law of nature. He was made Rector of the University of Utrecht in 1790. At the threat of French invasion of the Netherlands following the French Revolution Brown and his young family sailed back to Aberdeen in January 1795.

In June 1795 the magistrates of Aberdeen elected him to the post of minister of Greyfriars Church and he was ordained into that post in August 1795 at the same time being given the post of Professor of Divinity at Marischal College, which physically adjoins the church. In January 1796 he was made Principal of Marischal College in place of George Campbell. In March 1800 he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, and in October 1803 was made Dean of the Chapel Royal, and Dean of the Order of the Thistle.

From 1824 to 1828 he was Patron of the Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen.

He is buried in the Kirk of St Nicholas on Union Street in Aberdeen.

==Family==
In May 1786 in Utrecht he married his first cousin, Ann Elizabeth Brown (1764–1844), daughter of Rev Robert Brown of the Scots Church in Utrecht (1728–1777).

Their nine children were:

<doc id="1121184" wikidata="Q5264540" url="?curid=1121184" title="DeskMate">
<text>DeskMate is a software application that provides a graphical operating environment. It originally was for Tandy Corporation&#x27;s TRSDOS Operating System for their TRS-80 line of computers, but eventually shifted to MS-DOS. Like GEM from Digital Research, it is not a full operating system, but runs on top an existing system. Initial ports only ran on Tandy&#x27;s PCs such as the Tandy 1000, but later became available for true IBM PC compatibles and competed with early versions of Microsoft Windows.

Some non-Tandy software uses DeskMate to provide the user interface via a runtime version of the operating environment for those without it. This includes Activision&#x27;s The Music Studio and a version of Lotus 1-2-3.

== DeskMate 1.0 ==
DeskMate version 1.0 was included with the original Tandy 1000 and did not work correctly on non-Tandy computers. This was mainly due to the use of the function keys - as most non-Tandy PCs either did not come with an &quot;F12&quot; button or with one that did not act in the same way as a Tandy &quot;F12&quot; function key (Tandy adopted F11/F12 before IBM did).

DeskMate was popular, increasing sales of the Tandy 1000 to homes and schools.

== DeskMate 2 ==
By the time Personal DeskMate was released with the Tandy 1000 EX, it was a GUI that acted as a &quot;portal&quot; for many other office productivity applications. The DeskMate application would run on top of MS-DOS. The user interface was made up of text. The applications that made up the suite were:
*a basic word processor (&quot;Text&quot;)
*a spreadsheet (&quot;Worksheet&quot;)
*a calendar
*a basic database program (&quot;Filer&quot;)
The programs all fit on a 360K floppy disk. With careful manipulation, it was possible to isolate the individual applications and remove the others, placing them on separate floppies to be swapped when required. DeskMate was still required, as the individual programs could not be accessed directly.

=== Professional DeskMate ===
For corporate users, Tandy offered Professional DeskMate which included LocalTalk-based file-service and email extensions. This variant was renamed to &quot;Workgroup Companion&quot; for later versions.

==DeskMate 3==
DeskMate 3 added a number of basic applications:
*a drawing program (&quot;Draw&quot;)
*a simple digital audio editing program (&quot;Sound&quot;)
*a simple music program (&quot;Music&quot;), which could play music with audio samples created in Sound, used the 3-channel Tandy DAC, which provided 22 kHz 8-bit audio.
*an online service (&quot;PC Link&quot;)

The core parts of DeskMate (and DOS) were shipped in ROM on certain Tandy 1000s, allowing the computer to boot into DeskMate within a few seconds.

This was the first version of DeskMate that allowed for a run-time version that could be distributed with applications. This allowed users to use DeskMate applications on their PC&#x27;s even if they did not have DeskMate installed.

==WinMate==
This was a complete rewrite for Microsoft Windows 3.1, providing a simplified user interface and a few applications.

==Reception==
Noting that Tandy had found that Personal DeskMate increased sales of its 1000 computers, Stewart Alsop II in 1988 praised Tandy&#x27;s strategy for Professional DeskMate as &quot;brilliant: while IBM, Apple, and virtually the rest of the computing world focus almost exclusively on corporate and government business&quot;, Tandy &quot;responds to the basic needs of small businesses and professional offices&quot;.

<doc id="1121188" wikidata="Q973673" url="?curid=1121188" title="Palilula, Belgrade">
<text>Palilula (Serbian Cyrillic: Палилула, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. It has the largest area of all municipalities of Belgrade. The core of Palilula is close to the center of the city, but the municipality also includes sparsely populated land left of the Danube.

== Neighborhood ==

=== Location ===

Palilula is located east of Terazije in downtown Belgrade. Like most of Belgrade&#x27;s neighborhoods it has no firm boundaries and is roughly bordered by the &quot;Ruzveltova street&quot; and the municipality and neighborhood of Zvezdara on the east, the neighborhood of Hadžipopovac in its own municipality on the north, the neighborhood and municipality of Stari Grad and Jevremovac on the northwest (Jevremovac actually belongs to the neighborhood of Palilula, but administratively is part of Stari Grad), and the Tašmajdan and &quot;Bulevar kralja Aleksandra&quot; on the south, bordering the municipality of Vračar.

=== Population ===

Six local communities, sub-municipal administrative units, which make up the neighborhood of Palilula had a population of 36,216 in 1981, 35,579 in 1991, 34,559 in 2002 and 26,942 in 2011. Palilula in the narrowest sense (local communities of &quot;Stara Palilula&quot; and &quot;Starina Novak&quot;, excluding the neighborhoods of Tašmajdan, Hadžipopovac, Profesorska Kolonija and Bogoslovija) had a population of 12,638 in 1981, 12,178 in 1991, 11,590 in 2002 and 9,817 in 2011.

=== History ===

First houses in the area were built in the 16th century. In the direction from today&#x27;s Tašmajdan and &quot;Cvijićeva&quot; street there were gardens, vineyards, pastures but also mills and summer houses of the wealthier citizens of Belgrade. The neighborhood originated in the first half of the 18th century, when the Habsburg monarchy occupied northern Serbia 1717–1739. The settlement, built as an outer suburb of Belgrade, was originally named &quot;Karlstadt&quot; and was known for agriculture and skilled crafts and was considered as the most beautiful part of Belgrade at that time. In the early 19th century, it became overwhelmingly populated by the Serbs and was described as &quot;the village one quarter of the hour walk&quot; away from Belgrade. At the time, the village was made of small huts and hovels and mostly populated by the inhabitants from eastern Serbia.

In the 1830s, ruling prince Miloš Obrenović ordered his brother Jevrem Obrenović to resettle the Savamala neighborhood, located along the Sava river, and extending from the still Ottoman held Belgrade Fortress. Jevrem selected 30 families and settled them on the right bank of the Bulbulder stream. In 1840, villagers of Palilula rejected the regulatory plan of Belgrade, on the basis that projected new streets would be too wide, and later even tried to split from the municipality of Belgrade because of the city government&#x27;s low funding for the village. However, in the late 19th century Palilula became part of the continuously built-up area of Belgrade. The neighborhood was mostly residential, with commercial facilities closer to the center of Belgrade. When Belgrade was divided into six quarters in 1860, Palilula was one of them. By the census of 1883 it became the most populous one in Belgrade with 7,318 inhabitants, and that number grew to 10,563 in 1890.

In 1930, a large, wooden stadium was built in the neighborhood. A work of Momir Korunović, it was constructed in only two months for the &quot;slet&quot;, a massive gymnastic festival held as part of the Sokol movement. It had a capacity of 45,000 spectators. In terms of architecture, it was noted for its ornamented doors, which Korunović embellished with the elements carved in the Serbian national style. After the &quot;slet&quot; was finished, the construction was dismantled and re-used as a mobile construction for other festivities. On the location of the stadium, the building of the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Mechanical Engineering Faculty is situated today.

=== Characteristics ===

A section of Palilula is dedicated to the hajduk Starina Novak. Features bearing his name include the street, a local community, an elementary school founded in 1922 and a park. Area occupied by the park today, bounded by the streets of &quot;Starine Novaka&quot;, &quot;Cvijićeva&quot; and &quot;Dalmatinska&quot;, was named Starina Novak Square until 1954. In October 2017 city administration announced that a monument to Starina Novak will be erected in the park. The park covers . Pedestrian square along the Takovska Street has also been adapted into the Palilula Park, which covers . The Starina Novak park was thoroughly rearranged in the fall of 2023.

Area bounded by the streets of &quot;Stanoja Glavaša&quot;, &quot;Dalmatinska&quot;, &quot;Starine Novaka&quot; and &quot;Kneza Danila&quot; was, for the most part, occupied by the complex of the IKL factory. Before World War II, it was the Rogožarski factory, the first aircraft factory in Yugoslavia. After the war new Communist authorities nationalized the company, while the factory complex in Palilula was transformed into the IKL (ball bearing factory) in 1948. The complex was demolished and in 2015 construction of the residential and commercial neighborhood of &quot;Central Garden&quot; began. Apart from the commercial and business sections, it will have 400 apartments. In November 2017 a construction of the 16-storey &quot;Business Garden Tower&quot; was announced, with the deadline of 18 months.

In September 2019 it was announced that the area of the former open air shopping mall (demolished in 2017), stretching between the Kraljice Marije and Knez Danilova streets, will be adapted into the Raša Popov Park. It is named after the children&#x27;s author , who lived in one of the neighboring buildings until his death in 2017. His bust will also be placed in the park, which in total covers . Citizen disproved the original design of &quot;concrete park&quot;, asking for more green areas, so city changed the project. The park was scheduled to be finished in the spring of 2020. It was also decided to build a full, tall monument of Popov with book and umbrella, instead of a bust. The sculpture is made by Boris Deheljan, from steel bolts and nuts. It should be dedicated in July 2020. Deadline was then moved for September 2020 as city claimed the reconstruction is extremely complicated. The space was opened on 17 October 2020, but instead of the proper park it was adapted into the Plateau of Raša Popov.

=== Name ===

Apocryphal, folk etymology stories claim that name &quot;palilula&quot; came from the expression &quot;pali lulu&quot; which in English means &quot;light a pipe&quot;. One anecdote goes back to times when Belgrade and Serbia were occupied by the Ottoman Empire and Palilula was the area where most crops were, so Turkish rulers banned smoking due to a few instances of &quot;accidentally&quot; setting crops on fire. In the late summer and early autumn when all the crops had been harvested, the smoking ban was lifted and locals announced this by calling neighbors, letting them know that pipes might be lit. Another explanation comes from the time of Prince Miloš Obrenović&#x27;s rule; he banned smoking in Belgrade so people could only smoke outside the city gates.

However, chroniclers claim that the origin of the name comes from the brickyards which were located along the right bank of the Bulbulder stream. After the mud for bricks was mixed, shaped in molds and dried in the sun, the bricks were stacked to form conical shapes. The straw was then placed beneath, and set on fire, to bake and harden the bricks. The smoke vents beneath the bricks were called &quot;lula&quot; (&quot;pipe&quot;), hence the name.

== Municipality ==




=== Area ===

The area of Palilula is generally the north of Belgrade. It is the northernmost of all Belgrade&#x27;s municipalities and the easternmost of all municipalities. It is located on both banks of the Danube, which divides it in two: Šumadija section (on the right bank) and Banat section (on the left bank).

Šumadija section borders the municipalities of Stari Grad to the west, Vračar and Zvezdara to the south and Grocka to the extreme southeast. It also has a river border on the Danube to the province of Vojvodina (Municipality of Pančevo).

Banat section has no land borders to the other Belgrade municipalities, but has a river border on the Danube to the municipalities of Zemun and Stari Grad. The Danube also forms a complete western border to the rest of the Syrmia region in Vojvodina (municipality of Stara Pazova), while the river Tamiš is the eastern border (municipalities of Pančevo and Opovo). On the extreme north, Palilula borders the municipality of Zrenjanin (village of Čenta on the &quot;Karaš&quot; canal which connects the Danube and the Tamiš).

=== Geography ===

Šumadija section marks the northernmost point of Šumadija with Karaburma headland extending into the Danube. The prominent features in this part are the hills of Karaburma and &quot;Milićevo brdo&quot;, the spa of Višnjička Banja and the peninsula (formerly an island) Ada Huja.

Banat section is the extreme southwestern part of Banat region, known as Pančevački Rit. A large, flat, marshy floodplain of the Danube and Tamiš, it has been drained since 1945 but still has many features of a swamp, including slow, meandering and flooding streams (Vizelj, Mokri Sebeš, &quot;Jojkićev Dunavac&quot;, &quot;Dunavac&quot;, etc.) and marshy bogs (Sebeš, Veliko Blato, Široka Bara). An island of Kožara is located on the Danube, and is the projected starting point of the planned, much larger, artificial island of Čaplja. The spa of Ovčanska Banja is also located here. The area close to the Danube is heavily forested.

In the Pančevački Rit section there are two official, unfenced hunting grounds. One is named Pančevački Rit, while the other is called simply Rit. The Rit is located near Padinska Skela, from Belgrade along the &quot;Zrenjaninski put&quot;. It covers an area of , of which is a pheasantry. Animals bred in the facility include roe deer, hare, quail, mallard, greylag goose and 13,000 pheasants per year.

=== History and administration===

The municipality was created in 1956. On January 3, 1957, the municipality of Karaburma was annexed to it, while in 1965 the municipality of Krnjača (with entire Pančevački Rit) also administratively joined Palilula.

Presidents of the Municipality:

* 1997–2000: Gordana Todić (b. 1955)
* 2000–October 21, 2004: Milan Marković (b. 1970)
* October 21, 2004 – June 18, 2012: Danilo Bašić (b. 1973)
* June 18, 2012 – June 6, 2016: Stojan Nikolić (b. 1976)
* June 6, 2016 – June 28, 2021: Aleksandar Jovičić (b. 1976)
* July 26, 2021 – present: Miroslav Ivanović (b. 1954)

=== Dunavski Venac and Čenta ===

The idea of separating the area of former municipality of Krnjača start gaining momentum in the 2000s, this time under the name of Dunavski Venac. As procedure in the city statute provides that the municipal assembly (in this case, of Palilula) needs to start the motion in the city assembly, after years of public agitation, the municipal assembly of Palilula agreed to do so in summer 2005. However it did not officially do so, and the organization for the separation of Dunavski Venac announced it will go to court.

The village of Čenta in the Vojvodina&#x27;s municipality of Zrenjanin is located on the northern border of the municipality of Palilula. From time to time local residents have asked for Čenta to be annexed to the City of Belgrade. The majority of the population work in the territory of Belgrade and until recently, one regular bus line of Belgrade City public transportation connected Čenta to Belgrade.

Palilula Greenmarket (&quot;Paliluska pijaca&quot;) is a small farmers market in the neighborhood of Palilula, along the &quot;27. marta&quot; Street, below the Tašmajdan. It developed as an unregulated market in 1949. In November 2017 it was closed as the construction of the combined shopping center, which would partially include the modernized greenmarket, will begin. Some of the market stalls have been placed on the open, at the plateau near the Tašmajdan Sports and Recreation Center in the &quot;Ilije Garašanina&quot; Street, until the works are finished. The estimated length of the construction of the new market is 18 months, or May 2019. The new building has a total floor area of and because of the shape and multi-layered appearance, it has been nicknamed &quot;Vasa&#x27;s Torte&quot;. In May 2019 the deadline was moved to September 2019. Though deputy mayor Goran Vesić confirmed that the market will be opened on 1 September, though the construction works were finished by this date, the facility wasn&#x27;t connected to communal grid, including the electric one, nothing inside was installed and the object had no necessary permits for becoming operational, so the deadline was moved for 1 December, and then to the end of December. It was finally opened on 30 December 2019. Few months later, being located indoors and due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it was the first Belgrade farmers market to be closed, and the last one to get opened (23 March-28 April).

<text>Fordham is a village in rural Cambridgeshire, England. Fordham is part of the East Cambridgeshire district. It is four miles north of Newmarket, as well as being close to the settlements of Soham, Burwell, Isleham, Mildenhall and Chippenham.

==History==
The parish of Fordham covers in an irregular shape. Its southern border is the county border with Suffolk and most of its south-eastern border with Snailwell follows the path of the River Snail. It also borders Chippenham and Isleham to the east, Soham to the north, and Burwell to the west, as well as having a short boundary with Wicken at its western tip. In 1953 the civil parish was merged with that of Landwade, a tiny parish of only , although Landwade and its ecclesiastical parish are both in Suffolk.

The parish has been occupied for several thousand years; weapons and tools in both flint and metal have been found from the Early Bronze Age and Iron Age, as well as pottery and burials. Wall plaster and tiles have been found from the Roman era, indicating that villas may have been sited near to Biggin and Block Farms in the 2nd to 4th centuries A.D.

In the Middle Ages the village was home to Fordham Priory, a Gilbertine priory and cell to Sempringham Priory, that was founded in the reign of Henry III in the 13th century by Robert de Fordham. Fordham Abbey, a Grade II listed Georgian manor house was built on the site of the Priory in the eighteenth century.

Fordham had a railway station serving as a junction the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway and the Ipswich to Ely line that opened to the west of the village in 1879. The station finally closed in 1966.

Though spelled &quot;Fordeham&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village&#x27;s spelling has remained unchanged since the 10th century. The name &quot;Fordham&quot; means &quot;homestead or enclosure by a ford&quot;.

Fordham War Memorial commemorates the village&#x27;s dead from the two world wars. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and originally featured a bronze statue of St George by Sir George Frampton. The memorial was destroyed and the bronze stolen in 1991 and the community raised funds to rebuild it and replace the bronze with a fibreglass replica. It is a Grade II listed building.

==Church==
The parish church has been dedicated to St Peter since around 1850, prior to which it had been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 14th century. The present building consists of a chancel with side chapels and a two-storeyed north chapel, an aisled and clerestoried nave with south porch and west tower. It is a Grade I listed building.

The earliest parts of the building date from the 12th century, and stonework suggest that by 1200 it was already its present size. The majority of the current structure date from an extensive rebuild in the 13th century. The church is noted for its fine 14th-century north chapel, unusual in having an upper floor and undercroft.

==Village life==
The village has a Church of England-controlled Primary School which feeds into Soham Village College.

Fordham has a pub, The Chequers which was open by 1760. The Greyhound, which opened in the 1990s, converted into a restaurant called The White Pheasant. Other former pubs include the Green Dragon (previously known as The Bull) on the Market Street green, which was also open by 1760 and closed by the 1960s. The Crown pub became an Indian Restaurant in 2021, which was destroyed by a fire on 14 August 2023. 

Fordham Community Archive has been set up to record the history of Fordham in the form of photographs, documents and written and oral memories. The group was formed in August 2007 and holds community events.

== Environment ==
Fordham Woods nature reserve is located south of the village.

==Other details==
A Ham class minesweeper &quot;HMS Fordham&quot; is named after the village.

Fordham is the birthplace of operatic bass-baritone Darren Jeffery.
In 2007, villager Tracey Barnard was a contestant on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

<doc id="1121198" wikidata="Q389522" url="?curid=1121198" title="Iwama style">
<text>Iwama-style Aikido is the style of aikido that was taught in Iwama by the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, and especially the lineage passed on through Morihiro Saito, a close disciple who was given responsibility over Iwama dojo by Ueshiba.

It is also known by other names including &#x27; (see: &quot;ryū&quot;) and Iwama Aikido. It is often associated with the term &#x27; after the martial concept. It is sometimes also referred to as Traditional or  (, lit. traditional).

It is sometimes called Saito style, though never by Iwama stylists themselves as Saito insisted that he intended to preserve the founder&#x27;s style.

==Ranks==
At one point Saito gave out specific ranks at the insistence of his European students. However, he always awarded ranks through the Aikikai (original Aikido organization) out of respect for the Ueshiba family.

Saito also gave out mokuroku (scrolls) for his &quot;aiki-ken&quot; (sword) and &quot;aiki-jo&quot; (staff) with levels loosely modeled after the traditional license system of classical Japanese martial arts to students independent of ranks.

Today, Iwama-style aikido organisations can be found both within and outside of the Aikikai. The main non-Aikikai branch is Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai, founded by Morihiro Saito&#x27;s son Hitohiro Saito. It continues to issue grading certificates; however, many of Saito&#x27;s longest students have remained affiliated with the Aikikai. In Europe some of these groups belong to the Takemusu Aikido Kyokai umbrella organisation. In the United States, the major organization is the Takemusu Aikido Association.

==Style==
Iwama style includes the combined study () of traditional Japanese weapons (), specifically (staff) and (sword), and of empty-handed aikido (&quot;taijutsu&quot;), both accompanied by &quot;kiai&quot;. Iwama practitioners often claim that their aikido is close to that of the founder, as preserved by Morihiro Saito, largely based on photos taken from the Noma Dojo and a technical manual written by the founder.

Among non-Iwama Aikikai practitioners, a common opinion is that Iwama style mainly is Morihei Ueshiba&#x27;s aikido of the 1940s and 1950s not taking into consideration his later years, though Ueshiba resided in Iwama until his death there.

==Pedagogy==
Iwama-style aikido tends to be highly codified compared to most aikido practice. Weapons training, including kata, is stressed. Techniques are generally practiced first from a static grab and footwork is broken up into numbered steps. In addition weapons work involves many repetitions of suburi and paired weapons practice is practiced with a pause between each movement until students are relatively advanced.

A great deal of emphasis is placed on a stable hanmi or stance in Iwama-style aikido.

Every class in an Iwama-style dojo begins with the techniques and and ends with .

Several Iwama-style dojos around the world, such as Aikido in Fredericksburg, offer live-in apprentice programs (&quot;&quot;uchi-deshi&quot; programs&quot;) modeled after Saito&#x27;s program in Iwama.

===Progression===
Saito believed in a progression from static techniques to the spontaneous &quot;takemusu aiki&quot;. Many Iwama-style practitioners practice in stages, most often divided into:
# (basic/foundational) or (static) practice
# or (soft, flowing movement)
# (lit. the flow of &quot;ki&quot;)

==Technical characteristics==
In certain stances, a slight tilt of the hips is characteristic of the style. The feet are kept on a line, but the front foot points forward rather than turned out (in contrast to the Yoshinkan) causing the hips to be slightly rotated.

In work, the posture of , or standing with a dramatically minimized profile facing the opponent, is another unique characteristic of Iwama aikido.

Many techniques, especially techniques that begin from , start with &quot;nage&quot; (thrower or initiator) initiating a strike to &quot;uke&quot; (receiver) in the basic form of the technique. This is common in Yoshinkan, Manseikan, and Michio Hikitsuchi&#x27;s basic practices and the founder&#x27;s instruction in &quot;budo&quot;, but opposite of how many other styles of Aikido teach the techniques. Even when is striking, it is emphasized that &quot;tori&quot; initiates the encounter. Saito referred to this as the &quot;way of the mountain echo&quot; (&quot;yamabiko no michi&quot;), presumably after a poem by the founder.

In keeping with the above, most grabs in Iwama aikido are formalized as a response to a threat from unlike in most aikido styles that start attacks with a grab. As a result, Iwama-style grabs are firm and static without pushing or pulling and with the intention of immobilizing the body.

&quot;Suwari-waza&quot; in Iwama style is started completely in &quot;seiza&quot;. This is in contrast to some other styles where the practitioners often start already on their toes (&quot;kiza&quot;).

Iwama stylists employ &quot;kiai&quot; and &quot;atemi&quot; with great consistency.

 in Iwama-style aikido is always performed with the hips perpendicular to the and the hips acting as a fulcrum. 

In &quot;ukemi&quot; (responding) Iwama practitioners will usually attempt to parry the being thrown by , which may or may not be encouraged in other styles of aikido. Rolls are usually performed with the rear leg tucked.

=== (weapons technique)===
Focus on and (the relationship between weapons and taijutsu) is a hallmark of this style. Some of the practices were developed by Morihei Ueshiba while others are Saito&#x27;s distillations of his teachings and practices.
Weapons practice includes &quot;suburi&quot;, (1-step paired exercises), solo and paired kata, and &quot;tanren-uchi&quot; (striking a log or tire) with the &quot;jo&quot; and wooden sword. Though not formally part of the curriculum, Saito practiced Negishi-ryu and shuriken (throwing stars) is also sometimes practiced.

The sword forms of Iwama style are generally recognized as being descended from Kashima Shinto-ryu sword techniques. In particular the first two are nearly identical in the sequence of cuts to forms from Kashima Shinto-ryu. It is also believed that Yagyu style had influence through Masakatsu Nakai&#x27;s instruction of Ueshiba.
It has been widely observed that the are remarkably similar to spear techniques of Kukishin-ryu. Ueshiba was close friends with the Kuki family; this, along with the spear-like handling of the in Iwama style, has led to speculation that the Kukishin-ryu spear is partially the basis of Aiki-jo, though there is not enough evidence that Ueshiba formally studied the art in any depth.

== and ==
, literally coarse techniques, are occasionally practiced by Iwama-style aikido practitioners. These techniques are intended to explicitly show the injurious applications latent in aikido techniques and include simple kicks targeting the knees and entangling or twisting joints during throws with the option to break them. Some (modified basic techniques) in Iwama-style aikido also include entangling joints, locking large joints, strikes to vital points, and occasionally chokes using the arm or the partner&#x27;s uniform (dogi). For safety reasons these are never performed fully.

<text>Voždovac (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. According to the 2022 census results, the municipality has a population of 174,864 inhabitants.

The municipality is located in the south-central part of the urban area of Belgrade and in the central section of the wider Belgrade City area. It stretches meridionally (north to south) for almost , spreading to the south more than any other
municipality of Belgrade. Due to its shape, it borders more municipalities than any other: Vračar on the north, Zvezdara on the north-east, Grocka on the east, Sopot on the south, Barajevo on the south-west, Čukarica and Rakovica on the west and Savski Venac on the north-west.

==History==
The municipality of Voždovac originates from 1904. In 1945 Belgrade was divided into districts (&quot;rejon&quot;) and Voždovac became part of District VI. In 1952 the districts were abolished and the municipalities re-established. Municipality of Pašino Brdo was annexed to Voždovac on September 1, 1955 and today makes its northernmost part. The municipality was territorially shaped in the early 1960s when the municipality of Ripanj was added to Voždovac (the village of Veliki Mokri Lug was later detached and annexed to the municipality of Zvezdara). However, shaped this way, the elongated municipality causes problem to the inhabitants of its southern part as they have to travel over to the municipal assembly. There is an idea of separating suburban settlements (Beli Potok, Pinosava, Zuce, Ripanj) and creating new sub-Avalan municipality (Avalski Venac), with the village of Vrčin in the municipality of Grocka but no official move has been done so far in that direction.

==Geography==
The municipality is located in the northern section of the Šumadija region (&quot;Low Šumadija&quot;). The southern part covers the northern section of the woods of Lipovička šuma and roughly corresponds to the valley of the Topčiderka river which flows between the Pinosava and Ripanj plateaux. The central area is occupied by one of two &quot;Belgrade&quot; mountains, the -high Avala (the other one being Kosmaj). In the northern, urban section, Voždovac covers several of the 32 hills on which Belgrade is built, including Torlak and Pašino Brdo.

Apart from Topčiderka, numerous smaller rivers and intermittent creeks flow in the northern part of the municipality: Zavojnička reka, Vranovac, Milošev potok, Bubanj Potok, Kamena voda, Lipica, Drenjak, Kumodraški potok and parts of Rakovički potok, Bolečica and Jelezovac. The spring and the valley of the former Mokroluški Potok (now mostly conducted underground) is also located in the municipality. Despite having large wooded areas in the non-urban section (slopes of Avala, northern part of Lipovička šuma, Stepin Lug/Gaj), the urban area has only one real park, Šumice.

==Settlements==
The municipality of Voždovac has both urban neighborhoods of the Belgrade City proper (&quot;uža teritorija grada&quot;) and separate, suburban settlements in the Belgrade City Metro area.

==Neighborhood==

===Location===
The neighborhood of Voždovac is located south of downtown Belgrade, on a hill in the northern part of the municipality. Three long, more or less parallel streets shape the neighborhood into an elongated form in the north-west to south-east direction: western border is marked by Bulevar Oslobođenja (Boulevard of Liberation), which also makes the border to the municipality of Savski Venac, eastern by Kumodraška Street, while Vojvode Stepe Street stretches in between. Due to its shape, Voždovac borders many other neighborhoods: Autokomanda to the north, Diplomatska Kolonija on the north-west, Banjica (and Banjica Forest) on the west, Trošarina and Banjica II on the south-west, Kumodraž (its sub-neighborhoods of Kumodraž II and Torlak) on the south, Braće Jerković II and Mitrovo Brdo on the south-east, Braće Jerković on the east and Dušanovac on the north-east.

===Name and history===
Name Voždovac is derived from the word &quot;vožd&quot; meaning &quot;leader&quot; (literally, a &quot;duke&quot;, &quot;supreme vojvoda&quot;), one of the titles used by the Karađorđe Petrović, the leader of the First Serbian Uprising. He also commanded the liberation of Belgrade from the Turks in 1806, and on the very spot from where he started that operation today stands a Church of the Saint Emperor Constantine and Helena, popularly called the Voždovac Church (&quot;Voždovačka crkva&quot;). The spot he has chosen was outside of the &quot;Laudan&#x27;s trench&quot;, too distant for the Turks inside the trench to notice the Serbian fighters gathering but close enough to take the chargeon the trench. Unofficial name, &quot;Voždovo predgrađe&quot;, Vožd&#x27;s Suburb, was recorded after 1903, after the Karađorđević dynasty was restored on Serbian throne.

After the liberation in World War I in 1918, Voždovac was placed under the Belgrade&#x27;s administrative rule. A string of new neighborhoods encircled eastern outskirts of Belgrade, with names usually containing &quot;suburb&quot; and some member of the royal family. These original names either never became popular or were suppressed after World War II and replaced. The inspiration for the design of the neighborhoods came from the 1912 complex built along the in Paris. It consisted of 40 one-floor houses with gardens, indented from the main street. Settlement that subsequently developed was known as Činovnička Kolonija (Clerk&#x27;s colony). Still operational elementary school &quot;Branislav Nušić&quot; was built in 1935 and the neighborhood was officially named &quot;Predgrađe Kraljice Marije&quot; or Queen Maria&#x27;s Suburb, after the dowager queen Maria of Yugoslavia. Later, inhabitants colloquially began to use name Voždovac which spread and was adopted as the official name.

From June 1945 to December 1946, Voždovac was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VI.

===Characteristics===
Originally a residential area, as the neighborhood was growing and stretching to the south, it developed different features. The south-western extension to Torlak, along the &quot;Vojvode Stepe&quot; street, developed almost rural look, while the southern extension into the Kumodraž II is turned into one of the most heavily industrialized areas in the &quot;Old Belgrade&quot;. The western area, along the Boulevard of Liberation became somewhat of an elite neighborhood. Three faculties of the University of Belgrade are located in the neighborhood: Management (FON), Political sciences (FPN) and Transportation. Population of the neighborhood was 22,516 in 2002 and 23,153 in 2011.

The , colloquially called the Voždovac Church, is one of the neighborhood&#x27;s landmarks. It was damaged during World War I, but was reconstructed by 1926. Reconstruction design was drafted by architect , who also designed a new, larger church, which replaced the old one. The new church was opened on 1 December 1970. Icons were painted by Milić od Mačve, in the atypical manner, ignoring any schematism or traditional style. Clergy house was consecrated in 2011. Interior painting was done by Vojislav Luković.

&quot;Vojvode Stepe&quot; street is one of the main traffic routes in this part of Belgrade. What was announced as a massive reconstruction of the street began in July 2014 and lasted to July 2015. The original project, which envisioned the work in phases which would allow for the partial usage of the street, was soon abandoned as the company which done the reconstruction, &quot;Ratko Mitrоvić&quot;, started getting late even during the preparation stage so they simply closed the entire street. Also, it turned out that it is not the full reconstruction, as the underground installations weren&#x27;t replaced. Closing of the street caused massive disturbance of the traffic in this part of the city and economic damage to the stores and craftshops along the street. &quot;Ratko Mitrović&quot; asked for an extension of 72 days, but was granted 20 days by the city, to which they allegedly complied. However, after the street was officially open by the Mayor of Belgrade Siniša Mali, the works continued for weeks. Also, the completed job was of a low quality: badly projected pathways for the visually impaired, parts of the sidewalks, drains, etc. Since the first rains, a pond would form at the bottom end of the street. Mali accused the previous city administration for the &quot;bad contract&quot;, but he was already heading the city for 9 months when the works began. He also threatened the &quot;Ratko Mitrović&quot; that they will be fined for the delays, but instead granted them the extension of the deadline and the city hired the same company for further projects.

==Economy==
Suburban parts of the municipality are mostly agricultural, but the urban section has a large industrial zone, one of the largest in the city, mostly along the &quot;Kumodraška&quot; street. It comprises the factories of &quot;Vatrosprem&quot;, &quot;Tunelogradnja&quot;, &quot;Soko Štark&quot;, &quot;Napred&quot;, &quot;Montaža&quot;, &quot;Ratko Mitrović&quot;, etc. Some facilities of the Belgrade&#x27;s Communal Company and of Electricity company (EDB) are located in the neighborhood of Marinkova Bara, along the highway. A small center of the building companies and cement plants is growing along Bubanj Potok.

Administrative center of the municipality is located in Dušanovac, along the &quot;Ustanička&quot; street. It encompasses the building of the Municipal assembly, the police and fire station, the local clinical-ambulance center, the Fifth Municipal Court of Belgrade and the Special section of the Supreme court of Serbia for organized crime and war crimes (formerly the Supreme Military Court of Yugoslavia).

The Belgrade-Niš highway passes through the northern and eastern parts of the municipality while the road of &quot;Kružni put&quot; (and the projected Belgrade beltway) goes through the central parts, including the junction of two roads and tollbooth on Bubanj Potok, which marks the entrance into the Belgrade City proper. A railway also goes through the municipality, parallel to the &quot;Kružni put&quot;.

==Sports==
FK Voždovac are the neighbourhood team with significant local support. They play at the Voždovac Stadium. Rad are biggest club from Voždovac municipality of Belgrade, with biggest tradition off all local clubs, and played in European UEFA Competitions. Rad played in Yugoslav top league in the 1980s.

<doc id="1121202" wikidata="Q2905554" url="?curid=1121202" title="Blackburn Shark">
<text>The Blackburn Shark was a carrier-borne torpedo bomber designed and built by the British aviation manufacturer Blackburn Aircraft. It was originally known as the Blackburn T.S.R., standing for &quot;torpedo-spotter-reconnaissance&quot;, in reference to its intended roles. The Shark was the last of Blackburn&#x27;s biplane torpedo bombers.

The prototype Shark performed its maiden flight on 24 August 1933, the first production aircraft was introduced to service during the following year. It was operated by the Fleet Air Arm, Royal Canadian Air Force, Portuguese Navy, and the British Air Observers&#x27; School. By 1937, the Shark was already approaching obsolescence and replacement by the more capable Fairey Swordfish began during the following year. Despite this, numerous aircraft continued to be operated during the Second World War, largely being confined to secondary roles away from the front lines, such as training and target tug duties. Despite this, Sharks were repeatedly deployed in frontline roles during events such as the Dunkirk Evacuation and the Japanese invasion of British Malaya. During 1945, the final Sharks were withdrawn from service.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Blackburn T.9 Shark has its origins within the early 1930s as a private venture by the company. Originally known as the Blackburn T.S.R., standing for torpedo-spotter-reconnaissance, it was designed in conformance with Air Ministry Specification S.15/33, which sought a combined torpedo-(naval artillery) spotter-reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Blackburn was not the only company that opted to pursue this requirement; Fairey Aviation designed the TSR 1, a forerunner to the highly successful Fairey Swordfish that was active during the Second World War.

The T.S.R. represented a substantial departure from Blackburn&#x27;s previous naval aircraft designs, as the design team had opted to eliminate almost all use of streamlined bracing wires in favour of slanted struts. Despite this change, the wings were still foldable to ease stowage; a hydraulic wing-locking mechanism was incorporated to speed up folding/unfolding actions. Further measures to improve deck handling included the adoption of a tracking tail and pneumatic wheel brakes. The design process had been aided by operational experienced gained from the Blackburn Baffin. Features, such as the camber-changing flaps and fuselage construction, were derived from earlier prototypes.

Initially, the design of the T.S.R featured open cockpits, which were heated by an exhaust pipe muff. It had a crew of three, with the pilot seated in the first cockpit while the observer/wireless operator and gunner sharing the second cockpit, although longer range missions would sometimes be flown with only a crew of two. A prone position for bombing missions was also provisioned for, which included a watertight hatch and a hinged course-setting bomb sight. The bomb fusing controls were placed within reach of both the pilot and observer positions; ammunition was stowed in ten ammunition pans within the gunner&#x27;s cockpit. Armament consisted of one fixed, forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun, plus a .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K machine gun or Lewis Gun mounted on a Scarff ring in the rear cockpit, with provision for a torpedo or equivalent bombload carried externally.

The fuselage was strengthened to withstand catapult launches and divided into watertight compartments. Structural elements included stainless steel tubular spars and light alloy ribs; similar materials were used for the entire tail section save for the Alclad-plated fin. The majority of the flying surfaces had fabric coverings; the wing tips were detachable as to allow their easy replacement if damaged. The main fuel tanks were not integral to the structure; instead, two detachable tanks composed of duralumin were carried in separate watertight compartments forward of the pilot, housing up to 182.5 gallons of fuel. The aircraft had a range of 623 miles normally, but this could be extended to 1,130 miles via the use of a cylindrical tank, attached to the torpedo crutches, that was capable of holding up to 150 gallons of additional fuel.

===Into flight===
On 24 August 1933, Blackburn&#x27;s &quot;B-6&quot; prototype, powered by with a Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV engine, made its maiden flight at Brough. Following the completion of manufacturer trials, during which the engine was enclosed in a long-chord cowling, this prototype was delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Martlesham Heath for an official performance evaluation on 26 November 1933. During the following year, after the conclusion of testing at Martlesham, it was transferred to Gosport ahead of deck landing trials on board the aircraft carrier . These having been deemed successful as well, the prototype was taken up by the Directorate of Technical Development.

During August 1934, Blackburn received an initial production order for 16 aircraft to be produced for the FAA. One month later, limited production had already commenced. During October 1934, the name &quot;Shark I&quot; was officially sanctioned; around this time, a series of modifications were implemented, the most visible of which was a lengthened engine cowling that enclosed the exhaust collector ring. Amongst the modifications needed was for the aircraft to be convertible to a seaplane configuration, thus the prototype was overhauled and outfitted with twin floats equipped with shock absorbers. In this configuration, early test flights were conducted at Brough during April 1935; a successful series of sea trials took place at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment Felixstowe.

Blackburn was issued contract No. 334315/34 in conjunction with the new Specification 13/35. I, along with the additional contract No. 510994/35 to Specification 19/36, which was issued in January 1937. Even more contracts soon followed, leading to the rate of production exceeding that of numerous preceding Blackburn aircraft. During a three-year production run, a total of 238 Sharks were delivered to the FAA, comprising 16 Mk I (Tiger IV), 126 Mk II ( Tiger VI) and 95 Mk III ( Tiger VI). The Shark III differed from prior models in several respects, the most apparent of which was the addition of a glazed cockpit canopy and three-bladed Rotol wooden propellers. Late on in production, assembly from components produced elsewhere took place at Blackburn&#x27;s new factory in Dumbarton, Scotland, after which the completed airframes were transported by road to the Clyde at Abbotsinch (now Glasgow Airport) for flight testing.

==Operational history==
===Fleet Air Arm===
During May 1935, the Shark entered service with 820 Naval Air Squadron, replacing its Fairey Seals, aboard HMS &quot;Courageous&quot;. During the following year, it also equipping an additional two squadrons, 810 and 821. The FAA opted to actively deploy the Shark both in its landplane configuration on board the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers and as a seaplane on its battlecruisers, such as HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;; in the latter capacity, it would either be catapult-launched or lowered over the side to take off from the water, dependent on available equipment. Its seaworthiness was a particular point of praise, possessing favourable rough water handling and buoyancy characteristics.

Frontline operations involving the Shark were curtailed after only a relatively short timespan, as the type had started to be replaced by the more capable Fairey Swordfish as early as 1937. However, its value in secondary roles meant that it continued to be operated for numerous years beyond this point; a considerable number of Shark IIs were operated by the B and C training flights at Lee-on-Solent. 20 Sharks were converted by Blackburn into target tugs and saw use at units in Abbotsinch, Gosport, Crail, and Arbroath to help train pilots, starting in 1939. On 4 January 1939, two Sharks were taken up by No. 4 Anti-Aircraft Co-Operation Unit in Seletar, Singapore.

During the Dunkirk evacuation conducted between 26 May and 4 June 1940, numerous Sharks flew across the English Channel to spot and illuminate Kriegsmarine E-boats using flares, they were otherwise unarmed; these operations were hindered and eventually stopped by poor weather conditions. Widespread use of the Shark III for the training of aerial observers and navigators proceeded as far afield as Trinidad; its use in this role continued to as late as 1942.

Numerous Sharks would eventually be based at RAF Seletar as target tugs. During January 1942, the type was used to conduct patrol missions and even bombing raids against units of the Imperial Japanese Army as it advanced into Malaya.

===Overseas operators===

On 10 April 1935, Blackburn successfully secured a contract over rival firms from the United States, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Italy valued at £50,000 from the Portuguese government for six seaplanes. Designated &quot;Shark IIA&quot;, these were largely identical to FAA aircraft, save for being equipped with different armament as some could only be armed with torpedoes. The Portuguese Navy took delivery of them in mid-1936, stationing them at Bom Sucesso (now part of the Lisbon Naval Base) on the River Tagus outside Lisbon for coastal defense. On 22 October 193, a long distance non-stop flight was conducted by a Portuguese Shark between Bom Succeso and RAF Calshot, carrying a diplomatic dispatch to London and returning six days later.

During 1936, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) purchased seven Blackburn Shark II ( Tiger VI), the first four of which were shipped in September of that year. They were initially flown by No 6 (TB) Squadron, later operating as No 6 (BR) Sqn, on shipping patrols off the Canadian Pacific coast. The type was reportedly appreciated for its ruggedness and ease of maintenance, particularly when operated far from workshops. The Shark was an element of a wider plan to expand Canada&#x27;s aircraft production and during early 1939, a pair of Shark IIIs ( Pegasus III) were supplied by Blackburn as pattern aircraft for the 17 aircraft produced by Boeing Aircraft of Canada at their Vancouver facility, while their stainless steel spars were provided by Boulton Paul from the UK.

The Canadian-built aircraft were powered by Pegasus IX engines and were supplied to Nos 4 and 6 (BR) Squadrons. However, even before quantity manufacturing had been established, it was recognised that the Shark was obsolete and unable to fulfil Canada&#x27;s requirements. Nevertheless, the aircraft produced were deployed for naval reconnaissance and escorting friendly shipping near Canada. The last of the RCAF&#x27;s Sharks, some of which were operated as floatplanes, were withdrawn in August 1944, after which five aircraft were transferred to the RN Air Observers&#x27; School in Trinidad.

<text>Business Objects (BO, BOBJ, or BObjects) was an enterprise software company, specializing in business intelligence (BI). Business Objects was acquired in 2007 by German company SAP AG. The company claimed more than 46,000 customers in its final earnings release prior to being acquired by SAP. Its flagship product was BusinessObjects XI (or BOXI), with components that provide performance management, planning, reporting, query and analysis, as well as enterprise information management. Business Objects also offered consulting and education services to help customers deploy its business intelligence projects. Other toolsets enabled universes (the Business Objects name for a semantic layer between the physical data store and the front-end reporting tool) and ready-written reports to be stored centrally and made selectively available to communities of the users.

== History ==

 co-founded Business Objects in 1990 together with , and was chief executive until September 2005, when he became chairman and chief executive until January 2008. The concept of Business Objects and its initial implementation came from Jean-Michel Cambot.

In 1990, the first customer, Coface, was signed. The company went public on NASDAQ in September 1994, making it the first European software company listed in the United States. In 2002, the company made &quot;Time&quot; magazine Europe&#x27;s Digital Top 25 of 2002 and were &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; Europe Stars of Europe.

On 7 October 2007, SAP AG announced that it would acquire Business Objects for $6.8 billion. As of 22 January 2008, the corporation was fully operated by SAP; this was seen as part of a growing consolidation trend in the business software industry, with Oracle acquiring Hyperion in 2007 and IBM acquiring Cognos in 2008.

Business Objects had two headquarters in San Jose, California, and Paris, France, but their biggest office was in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company&#x27;s stock was traded on both the Nasdaq and Euronext Paris (BOB) stock exchanges.

=== Legal ===
On April 2, 2007, a lawsuit from Informatica (inherited by Business Objects from the purchase of Acta Technologies in 2002) resulted in an award of $25 million in damages to Informatica for patent infringement. The lawsuit related to embedded data flows with one input and one output. Informatica asserted that the ActaWorks product (later sold by Business Objects as part of Data Integrator), infringed several Informatica patents including US Patent Nos. 6,014,670 and 6,339,775, both titled &quot;Apparatus and Method for Performing Data Transformations in Data Warehousing.&quot; Business Objects subsequently released a new version of Data Integrator (11.7.2) which removed the infringing product capability.

<text>Zvezdara (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. The municipality is geographically hilly and with many forests. According to the 2022 census results, the municipality has a population of 172,625 inhabitants.

The municipality of Zvezdara is located east of Belgrade and occupied almost the entire eastern urban section of the city. It borders the municipalities of Palilula on the north-west, north and north-east, Grocka on the east and south-east, Voždovac on the south and south-west and Vračar on the west.

==History==
Historically, Zvezdara hill was known as Great Vračar. Vračаr area at that time occupied much wider area that it does today and was divided into West Vračar, East Vračar and Great Vračar. Turkish source from 1621 describes it as &quot;a hill and a big field&quot;. In the 17th and 18th century, the area was covered in vineyards, orchards and lush oriental gardens, a major excursion ground for the wealthy Belgrade Turks which called the hill Ekmekluk (Turkish &quot;ekmek&quot;, meaning bread) and built their summer houses there. The Ekmekluk occupied the slope which today spreads from the observatory to the Cvetko Market.

When Belgrade was occupied in 1717 by Austria, a defense moat was built whose outer section crossed the hill, where the modern &quot;Volgina&quot; street is today. After Austria re-occupied Belgrade in 1789, the trench was reconstructed by the general Ernst Gideon von Laudon and became known as the &quot;Laudan trench&quot; (Serbian: Laudanov šanac or simply Šanac). Due to the military importance of the hill, its gardens were neglected.

Until the 1930s, the Zvezdara hill was known as Veliki Vračar (Great Vračar). In the 19th century the foothills were not urbanized and, being far from the city center, were used by the Belgraders as a resort and picnic area, named &quot;Baba Ružin kraj&quot; (&quot;Grandma Ruža&#x27;s neighborhood&quot;). In 1929-32 an observatory designed by Czech-born architect Jan Dubový (1892–1969) was built on top of the hill. The observatory was originally called &quot;zvezdara&quot; (&quot;star-house&quot;) in Serbian, so the hill and the developing suburban area of Belgrade around it was named that way soon. In time, Latinism &quot;opservatorija&quot; replaced &quot;zvezdara&quot;, which in turn completely disappeared from spoken language as such, but remained as a name of Belgrade&#x27;s neighborhood. As a result, many today believe Zvezdara was named that way simply after stars (Serbian &quot;zvezda&quot;, star). In 1935 the Clinical Center (KBC) Zvezdara was built as a bequest by wealthy Serbian merchant Nikola Spasić. The area was rich in water, originally used for city waterworks. Several public drinking fountains were built (like Pasha&#x27;s fountain, dating from the First Serbian Uprising, in modern &quot;Živka Davidovića&quot; street or the Fountain of the third-class reservists, for the killed soldiers of the World War I. near KBC Zvezdara).

The KBC Zvezdara, which in time became known as the City Hospital Zvezdara, doubled its capacities already prior to World War II, expanding also number of wards. After the war it expanded capacities almost 8 times compared to December 1935, when it was opened and became one of the largest medical complexes in Serbia. Donation from the Sue Ryder charity in 1963, allowed the establishment of the first geriatrics ward in Yugoslavia.

The municipality of Zvezdara was created on 1 September 1955, from (at that time) new neighborhoods around the observatory. On 1 January 1957 Zvezdara was greatly enlarged as the municipalities of Stari Đeram and Mali Mokri Lug were annexed to it. Villages of Kaluđerica, Vinča and Leštane (previously parts of Mali Mokri Lug) were later detached and annexed to the municipality of Grocka. In the first half of the 1970s, all settlements in the municipality became part of the Belgrade city proper (&quot;uža teritorija grada&quot;) so the entire municipality of Zvezdara is today one of six municipalities which are completely part of urban Belgrade.

==Neighborhood==
The Zvezdara neighborhood () is located south-east of downtown Belgrade. In its original sense, the neighborhood of Zvezdara comprises areas around the Zvezdara Forest, including the neighborhood of Zvezdara II. It borders the neighborhoods of Bogoslovija and Karaburma on the north, Ćalije on the north-east (all in the municipality of Palilula), Mirijevo on the east, Mali Mokri Lug on the south-east, Cvetkova Pijaca and Konjarnik on the south, Lion on the south-west and Bulbuder on the west. The area had a population of 10,095 by the 2002 census of population. However, after the creation of the municipality in 1955, the entire section west and south-west of Zvezdara is today considered as part of it in a narrow sense (Lion, Bulbuder, Lipov Lad, Cvetkova Pijaca, etc.).

This is a list of neighborhoods in the municipality:
==Geography==

Despite being one of Belgrade&#x27;s minor municipalities in terms of area (31 square kilometer), Zvezdara covers some of the highest sections of urban Belgrade, including the hills:
* Stojčino Brdo (270 meters)
* Orlovica (265 meters, also, but incorrectly, named Orlovača on some city maps)
* Zvezdara (253 meters)
* Mokroluško Brdo (234 meters)

Zvezdara basically has no real city parks, but has two large wooded areas, Zvezdara Forest (with an arranged park within, in the north-central part) and the northern section of Stepin Lug in the southern part of the municipality. Peti Park (Fifth park) is a minute green area in the neighborhood of Lipov Lad which gained a lot of publicity in the mid-2000s with a public movement to keep the area green.

Zvezdara does not come out on the river banks of two major Belgrade&#x27;s rivers (the Danube and Sava). The major water flows in the municipality are two creeks, both of which are partially conducted underground in the city sewer: Mokroluški potok and &quot;Mirijevski potok&quot;. For several hundred meters, the Bolečica river flows through the southernmost part of the municipality, near Bubanj Potok.

==Demographics==

According to the 2022 census results, the municipality has a population of 172,625 inhabitants. The population of the municipality had a steady, large growth until the 1990s when birthrates plunged in all of Serbia due to the Yugoslav Wars. Zvezdara remains one of the most densely populated areas in entire Serbia, with 4,897 inhabitants per square kilometer .

==Economy==
The following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2022):
===Industry===
As many areas of modern Zvezdara municipalities were villages and rural areas annexed to it in the 1950s, entire southern and eastern sections (Padina, Veliki Mokri Lug, Mali Mokri Lug, Mirijevo) are without industry. Industrial facilities are mostly grouped in two sections: Konjarnik (plastics &quot;Bukulja&quot;, precise and optical instruments &quot;Precizna mehanika&quot;, white metals &quot;Metal&quot;) and upper &quot;Bulevar kralja Aleksandra&quot; section (textile &quot;Kluz&quot;, electronics &quot;Nikola Tesla&quot;, plastics &quot;Utenzilija&quot;, presses &quot;Glas Javnosti&quot; and &quot;Kurir&quot;, foundry &quot;Livnica&quot;).

===Commerce===
As most of the &quot;Bulevar kralja Aleksandra&quot; goes through the municipality of Zvezdara, one of the strongest commercial zones in Belgrade developed around this, the longest street in the old section of Belgrade (9 kilometers). The long zone along the boulevard, simply known as &quot;Bulevar&quot; (despite there are some 20 boulevards in Belgrade), apart from several dozens of shops of all kinds, hosted also hundreds of street sellers, which are now confined to the large covered fair-type store named &quot;Depo&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

===Transportation===

Some of the busiest streets in Belgrade pass through the municipality of Zvezdara. Basically, the main street that goes through the central part of the entire municipality is Bulevar kralja Aleksandra which continues through the municipality of Grocka to the town of Smederevo. Additionally, in almost parallel way, the Highway Belgrade–Niš goes through the southern part. &quot;Ruzveltova&quot; and &quot;Mije Kovačevića&quot; in the eastern section are among the busiest and most polluted traffic areas in the city. Other major city routes include streets &quot;Vojislava Ilića&quot;, &quot;Ustanička&quot;, &quot;Dimitrija Tucovića&quot;, &quot;Dragoslava Srejovića&quot;, &quot;Milana Rakića&quot;, &quot;Jovanke Radaković&quot;, &quot;Mirijevski venac&quot; and &quot;Matice Srpske&quot;. The large bus garage depot of GSP Belgrade, city&#x27;s public transportation company and &quot;Lasta&quot;, its sister company, are located on the highway.

There is no railroad passing through the municipality, but Vukov Spomenik is one of the underground train stations of the future Belgrade Metro, which for now operates as part of the Belgrade-Pančevo railway (local Beovoz rail), connecting Nova Pazova (in the province of Vojvodina), Belgrade and Pančevo (in Vojvodina again).

===Zvezdara II===
A northern sub-neighborhood of Zvezdara, today mostly centered on the roundabout of bus line number 65. It consists of several small urban patches in the northern section of Zvezdara Forest, north of the observatory and Mihajlo Pupin Institute and along the &quot;Dragoslava Srejovića&quot; street, which divides it from the neighborhoods of Karaburma and Ćalije on the north and north-east, respectively, both in the municipality of Palilula.

===Zvezdara Forest===
Zvezdara Forest (&quot;Zvezdarska šuma&quot; or &quot;Zvezdani Gaj&quot;, Serbian Cyrillic: Звездарска шума or Звездани гај) After Topčider and Košutnjak, Zvezdara is the largest forest in the urban zone of Belgrade, a crescent-shaped wooded area which covers most of the Zvezdara Hill. The northern and eastern border of the wood is formed mostly by the &quot;Dragoslava Srejovića&quot; street. It borders the neighborhoods of Karaburma on the north, Ćalije on the north-east, Mirijevo on the east, Cvetkova Pijaca on the south and Zvezdara itself on the west.

In the beginning of the 20th century the Veliki Vračar Hill area was designed for afforestation. After the construction of the observatory in 1929-32 on top of the hill, the forest creation began making a unique artificially created green zone in Belgrade&#x27;s urban tissue. Today, the observatory is roughly in the middle of the forest.

The Zvezdara Forest today covers an area of 137 hectares, out of which 21 hectare is arranged as a park. Apart from the observatory, objects within the forest or near it include the &quot;Mihajlo Pupin Institute&quot; in the north-central and seven small stadiums (FC 29. Novembar, FC Zvezdara, FC Mladi proleter) in the north-western section. Patches of the northern section are urbanized, forming a neighborhood of Zvezdara II (especially along the &quot;Dragoslava Srejovića&quot; street). The forest is also damaged by the unauthorized individual residential construction, so in 2007 Belgrade City government announced further plans to extend the Zvezdara Forest to the north and south, connecting it in the process to Ada Huja and Šumice, respectively, either as real park or just avenues, and thus creating Belgrade&#x27;s greenway.

Number of animal species protected by Serbian and international laws live in Zvezdara forest. Some of them are:
*East European hedgehog (Latin &quot;Erinaceus concolor&quot;; Serbian: &quot;evropski belogrudi jež&quot;)
*European mole (Lat. &quot;Talpa europaea&quot;; Serbian: &quot;krtica&quot;)
*Common buzzard (Lat. &quot;Buteo buteo&quot;; Serbian: &quot;mišar&quot;)
*Tawny owl (Lat. &quot;Strix aluco&quot;; Serbian: &quot;šumska sova&quot;)
*Long-eared owl (Lat. &quot;Asio otus&quot;; Serbian: &quot;mala ušara&quot;)
*Scops owl (Lat. &quot;Otus scops&quot;; Serbian: &quot;ćuk&quot;)
*Little owl (Lat. &quot;Athene noctua&quot;; Serbian: &quot;kukumavka&quot;)

==International cooperation==
Zvezdara is twinned with the following cities and municipalities:

* Kisela Voda, North Macedonia

Honoring this cooperation, one street between Zvezdara and Mirijevo was named &quot;Kisela Voda&quot; in the mid-2000s.

<text>El Altar or Capac Urcu (possibly from Kichwa &quot;kapak&quot; principal, great, important / magnificence, &quot;urku&quot; mountain) is an extinct volcano on the western side of Sangay National Park in Ecuador, south of Quito, with a highest point of . Spaniards named it so because it resembled two nuns and four friars listening to a bishop around a church altar. In older English sources it is also called The Altar.

==Geology==
El Altar consists of a large stratovolcano of Pliocene-Pleistocene age with a caldera breached to the west. Inca legends report that the top of El Altar collapsed after seven years of activity in about 1460, but the caldera is considered to be much older than this by geologists. Nine major peaks over form a horseshoe-shaped ridge about across, surrounding a central basin that contains a crater lake at about , known as Laguna Collanes or Laguna Amarilla.


==Access and recreation==
El Altar is perhaps the most technically demanding climb in Ecuador. The route to the El Obispo summit is graded D+. December through February are the best months to attempt an ascent. Much more accessible is the hike to the lake within the caldera of the mountain. From Riobamba, one takes a bus for about an hour to Candelaria and then checks in at the ranger station to enter the Sangay park. About 4–7 hours of an extremely muddy trail (knee-high rubber boots are recommended) leaves one at the refuge belonging to Hacienda Releche, which can be rented. The refuge has many beds, and a kitchen. To hike to the lake is another 1.5h - 2 hours from the refuge across a valley and up a steep hill.

<doc id="1121222" wikidata="Q1385716" url="?curid=1121222" title="Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing">
<text>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy designed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It was devised by Francine Shapiro in 1987.

EMDR involves talking about traumatic memories while engaging in side-to-side eye movements or other forms of bilateral stimulation. It is also used for some other psychological conditions.

EMDR is recommended for the treatment of PTSD by various government and medical bodies citing varying levels of evidence, including the World Health Organization, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and the US Departments of Veteran Affairs and Defense. The American Psychological Association does not endorse EMDR as a first-line treatment, but indicates that it is probably effective for treating adult PTSD. 

Systematic analyses published since 2013 generally indicate that EMDR treatment efficacy for adults with PTSD is equivalent to trauma-focused cognitive and behavioral therapies (TF-CBT), such as Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). However, bilateral stimulation does not contribute substantially, if at all, to treatment effectiveness. The predominant therapeutic factors in EMDR and TF-CBT are exposure and various components of cognitive-behavioral therapy. 

Because eye movements and other bilateral stimulation techniques do not uniquely contribute to EMDR treatment efficacy, EMDR has been characterized as a purple hat therapy, i.e., its effectiveness is due to the same therapeutic methods found in other evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD, namely exposure therapy and CBT techniques, without any contribution from its distinctive add-ons.

== History ==
EMDR was invented by Francine Shapiro in 1987.

==Technique==
EMDR is typically undertaken in a series of sessions with a trained therapist. The number of sessions can vary depending on the progress made. A typical EMDR therapy session lasts from 60 to 90 minutes.

The person being treated is asked to recall an image, phrase, and emotion that represent a level of distress related to a trigger while generating one of several types of bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping. The 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline says that &quot;Like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of beliefs, (c) extended exposure or (d) homework.&quot;

==Possible mechanisms==
===Incomplete processing of experiences in trauma===
Many proposals of EMDR efficacy share an assumption that, as Shapiro posited, when a traumatic or very negative event occurs, information processing of the experience in memory may be incomplete. The trauma causes a disruption of normal adaptive information processing, which results in unprocessed information being dysfunctionally held in memory networks. According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: &quot;This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories.&quot; This proposed mechanism has no known scientific basis.

===Other mechanisms===
Several other possible mechanisms have been proposed:
* EMDR may impact working memory. If a patient performs bilateral stimulation task while remembering the trauma, the amount of information they can recall is thought to be reduced, making the resulting negative emotions less intense and more bearable. This is seen by Robin Logie of the EMDR Association UK and Ireland as a &quot;distancing effect&quot;. The client is then believed to re-evaluate the trauma and process it in a less-harmful environment. This explanation is plausible, given research showing that memories are more modifiable once recalled.
* Horizontal eye movement is thought to trigger an &quot;orienting response&quot; in the brain, used in scanning the environment for threats and opportunities.
* The idea that eye movement prompts communication between the two sides of the brain. This idea is not grounded in accepted neuroscience.

===Bilateral stimulation, including eye movement===
Bilateral stimulation is a generalization of the left and right repetitive eye movement technique first used by Shapiro. Alternative stimuli include auditory stimuli that alternate between left and right speakers or headphones and physical stimuli such as tapping of the therapist&#x27;s hands or tapping devices.

Most meta-analyses have found that the inclusion of bilateral eye-movements within EMDR makes little or no difference to its effect. Meta-analyses have also described a high risk of allegiance bias in EMDR studies. One 2013 meta-analysis with fewer exclusion criteria found a moderate effect.

== Research ==
===Effectiveness===
Systematic reviews in 2013, including a Cochrane study comparing EMDR with other psychotherapies in the treatment of chronic PTSD found EMDR to be as effective as TF-CBT (trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapies). A 2018 systematic review found moderate strength of evidence supporting the effectiveness of EMDR in reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as increasing the likelihood of patients losing their PTSD diagnosis. A 2020 systematic review concluded: &quot;A recent increase in RCTs [randomized controlled trials] of psychological therapies for PTSD, results in a more confident recommendation of CBT-T and EMDR as the first-line treatments.&quot; A 2023 Cochrane systematic review analyzed psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood and concluded that EMDR is a &quot;first-line treatment&quot; for PTSD along with other trauma-focused psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure.

===Client experience===
In a 2021 systematic review of 13 studies, clients had mixed perceptions of the effectiveness of EMDR therapy.

=== Treating conditions other than PTSD ===
EMDR has been tested on a variety of other mental health conditions with mixed results.
* A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found EMDR to have a moderate benefit in treating depression, but the number and quality of the studies were low.
* Positive effects have also been shown for certain anxiety disorders, but the number of studies was low and the risk of bias high. The American Psychological Association describes EMDR as &quot;ineffective&quot; for the treatment of panic disorder.
* EMDR has been found to cause strong effects on dissociative identity disorder patients, leading to recommendations for adjusted use.
* A 2023 systematic review of evidence found EMDR&#x27;s effectiveness in treating mental health conditions of children and adolescents who have been sexually abused is limited.

== Professional practice guidelines ==
* The World Health Organization&#x27;s 2013 report on stress-related conditions found insufficient evidence to support EMDR for acute symptoms of traumatic stress. Its 2023 guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders recommended EMDR with moderate evidence for adults and children in treating PTSD.
* The 2018 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies practice guidelines &quot;strongly recommend&quot; EMDR as an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress symptoms.
* As of 2017, the American Psychological Association &quot;conditionally recommends&quot; EMDR for the treatment of PTSD in adults, meaning its use is suggested rather than recommended.
* The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x27;s 2018 PTSD guidelines found low-to-very-low evidence of efficacy for EMDR in treating PTSD, but what was available justified recommending it for non combat-related trauma.
* A 2017 joint report from the US Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense describes the evidence for EMDR in the treatment of PTSD as &quot;strong.&quot;
* The Australian 2013 National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines recommends EMDR for the treatment of PTSD in adults with its highest grade of evidence, noting that &quot;EMDR now includes most of the core elements of standard trauma-focussed CBT (TF-CBT)&quot; and &quot;the two variants of trauma-focussed therapy are not statistically different.&quot;
* The Institute of Medicine&#x27;s 2008 report on the treatment of PTSD found insufficient evidence to recommend EMDR, and criticized many of the available studies for methodological flaws including allegiance bias and insufficient controls.
* The Dutch National Steering Committee on Mental Health Care has released multidisciplinary guidelines which describe &quot;insufficient scientific evidence&quot; to support EMDR in the acute period following a stressful event (2008), but recommend EMDR&#x27;s use in chronic PTSD (2003).

== Criticism ==
EMDR is controversial among some scholars in the psychological community. It is used by some practitioners for trauma therapy and in the treatment of complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

EMDR has been called a purple hat therapy because any effectiveness is provided by the underlying therapy (or the standard treatment), not from EMDR&#x27;s distinctive features.

Some scholars have criticized Francine Shapiro for repeatedly increasing the length and expense of training and certification, allegedly in response to the results of controlled trials that cast doubt on EMDR&#x27;s efficacy. This included requiring the completion of an EMDR training program in order to be qualified to administer EMDR properly after researchers using the initial written instructions found no difference between no-eye-movement control groups and EMDR-as-written experimental groups. Further changes in training requirements and/or the definition of EMDR included requiring level II training when researchers with level I training still found no difference between eye-movement experimental groups and no-eye-movement controls and deeming &quot;alternate forms of bilateral stimulation&quot; (such as finger-tapping) as variants of EMDR by the time a study found no difference between EMDR and a finger-tapping control group. Such changes in definition and training for EMDR have been described as &quot;ad hoc moves [made] when confronted by embarrassing data&quot;.

EMDR adds a number of techniques that do not appear to contribute to therapeutic effectiveness, e.g., bilateral stimulation. EMDR is classified as one of the &quot;power therapies&quot; alongside thought field therapy, Emotional Freedom Techniques and othersso called because these therapies are marketed as being superior to established therapies which preceded them.

EMDR has been characterized as pseudoscience, because the underlying theory and primary therapeutic mechanism are unfalsifiable and non-scientific. EMDR&#x27;s founder and other practitioners have used untestable hypotheses to explain studies which show no effect. The results of the therapy are non-specific, especially if directed eye movements are irrelevant to the results. When these movements are removed, what remains is a broadly therapeutic interaction and deceptive marketing. According to neurologist Steven Novella:

Furthermore, Novella argues that investigation into EMDR has been characterised by poor-quality studies, rather than tightly-controlled trials that could justify or falsify the mechanisms that have been proposed to support it. Novella writes that the research quantity nevertheless means that EMDR has claimed a place among accepted treatments and is &quot;not likely going away anytime soon, even though it is a house of cards built on nothing&quot;.

EMDR has been characterised as a modern-day mesmerism, as the therapies have striking resemblances, from the sole inventor who devises the system while out walking, to the large business empire built on exaggerated claims. In the case of EMDR, these have included the suggestions that EMDR could drain violence from society and be useful in treating cancer and HIV/AIDS. Psychology historian Luis Cordón has compared the popularity of EMDR to that of other cult-like pseudosciences, facilitated communication and thought field therapy.

A parody website advertising &quot;sudotherapy&quot; created by a fictional &quot;Fatima Shekel&quot; appeared on the internet in the 1990s. Proponents of EMDR described the website as libelous, since the website contained an image of a pair of shifting eyes following a cat named &quot;Sudo&quot;, and &quot;Fatima Shekel&quot; has the same initials as EMDR&#x27;s founder, Francine Shapiro. However, no legal action took place against the website or its founders.

== Society and culture ==
* Sandra Bullock used EMDR following a home invasion by a stalker in 2014.
*In 2019 Jameela Jamil said she partook in EMDR therapy to treat her post traumatic stress disorder.
* In 2021 Prince Harry took a course of EMDR and filmed a session for Oprah Winfrey during a mental health television documentary.
* In 2022 BBC war correspondent Fergal Keane, who suffered from PTSD, credited his EMDR therapist with helping save his life.

<doc id="1121227" wikidata="Q2419362" url="?curid=1121227" title="Theosophical Society in America">
<text>The Theosophical Society in America (TSA) is a member-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the teaching of Theosophy and affiliated with the international Theosophical Society based in Adyar, Chennai, India. The name &quot;Theosophical Society in America&quot; was legally adopted by the American Theosophical Society in 1934. Previously, other organizations had used the same name during the years 1895–98 and 1898–1908.

== Philosophy ==
The Theosophical Society is composed of individuals united by their concurrence with its three Objects, by their dedication to promoting brotherhood, and by their interest in study and spiritual self-transformation. Theosophists consider that belief should be the result of individual study, experience, and insight, rather than reliance on dogma. They see each religion as an expression of Divine Wisdom, adapted to the needs of a particular time and place. Theosophy regards the universe as alive and interrelated, with an intelligent order guiding the cyclical evolution of all life. The Theosophical Society supports the right of individual freedom of thought for every person, and no doctrine is in any way binding on any member of the Society.

== Objects ==
The three declared Objects of the Theosophical Society are:
* To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.
* To encourage the comparative study of religion, philosophy, and science.
* To investigate unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in humanity

== Mission statement ==
The Theosophical Society in America encourages open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation.

== History ==
Russian expatriate Helena Blavatsky and American Colonel Henry Steel Olcott founded the Theosophical Society with attorney William Quan Judge and others in late 1875 in New York City. After its two major co-founders departed for India in 1879 to establish the international headquarters of the Society in Adyar, India (near Madras, now known as Chennai), young Mr. Judge carried on the work of advancing interest in Theosophy within the United States. By 1886 he had established an American Section of the international Society with branches in fourteen cities. Rapid growth took place under his guidance, so that by 1895 there were 102 American branches with nearly six thousand members. Madame Blavatsky died in 1891, leaving Colonel Olcott and English social activist Annie Besant as the principal leaders of the international movement based in Adyar, and William Quan Judge heading the American Section.

During the contentious Ninth Annual Convention of the American Section in 1895, eighty-three lodges voted for autonomy from the international Theosophical Society Adyar. The international President-Founder, Colonel Olcott, interpreted this action as secession, and revoked the charters of those lodges, whose members reorganized into the first “Theosophical Society in America” under William Quan Judge. After Judge&#x27;s death the following year, Katherine Tingley stepped into the leadership of that organization, and in 1898 folded the Theosophical Society in America into the Universal Brotherhood, resulting in the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society. After several changes in location and name, the successor organization is now known as the Theosophical Society Pasadena. Other groups split off from Tingley&#x27;s organization over the years, becoming Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove) the Theosophical Society of New York, the United Lodge of Theosophists, and Temple of the People in Halcyon, California. The second “Theosophical Society in America” headed by Ernest Temple Hargrove dropped the words &quot;in America&quot; from its name in 1908.

Five American lodges that had opposed the 1895 secession retained their affiliation with the international Society in Adyar. They formed a new American Section known as the American Theosophical Society under the leadership of Alexander Fullerton. Extensive lecture tours by Annie Besant and Constance Wachtmeister elicited much new interest in the American Theosophical Society, so that by 1900 the organization claimed 1286 members and 71 branches.

In an attempt to clarify the complex history of the Theosophical movement in the United States, Dorothy Bell has created a diagram along the lines of a family tree, which can be viewed at American Family Tree of Theosophy . See also Other Theosophical societies in the United States below.

The American Theosophical Society was legally renamed &quot;The Theosophical Society in America&quot; in 1934, and has existed under that name ever since. Like other Theosophical groups, the organization aspires to educate the public about the principles of Theosophy through publications, public programs, and local group activities. A video of Society history may be viewed at .

== Organization ==
The modern Theosophical Society in America is a member-based not-for-profit corporation. It is incorporated in the state of Illinois with federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. The national headquarters has been located in Wheaton, Illinois since 1927. About 115 local groups include branches (also called lodges) and smaller study centers. As of 2008, the membership comprised about 4000 people.

== Leadership ==

The TSA is governed by a Board of Directors that meets at the national headquarters. Officers include a president, vice president, national treasurer, and national secretary. Two directors are elected by members from each of three geographical districts in the United States.

The national president also has the title of General Secretary for the American section of the Theosophical Society Adyar based in Chennai, India, and participates in the General Council that governs the international Society. These are the presidents since the 1895 reorganization of the American Society:
== National headquarters ==

Under Alexander Fullerton, the American Theosophical Society (now known as Theosophical Society in America) was based in New York City, but his successor, Dr. Weller van Hook, moved the headquarters to Chicago in 1907. A. P. Warrington transferred operations to Hollywood in 1912, where the Theosophical colony of Krotona was established. Most of the colony later moved north to Ojai, California, while the headquarters returned to Chicago in 1920.

During his presidency, L. W. Rogers sought to establish a permanent headquarters in a central and accessible location. He led a search for land where a new headquarters could be established. Dozens of sites within of Chicago were considered before an appropriate property was located in Wheaton, Illinois. This western suburb of Chicago met all the search criteria in that it was centrally located, with excellent rail transportation, a serene rural atmosphere, and affordable land. In 1925 the Society purchased almost of farmland, and immediately began planting a grove of trees.

At the recommendation of Theosophist and architect Claude Fayette Bragdon, the Chicago architectural firm of Pond &amp; Pond, Martin &amp; Lloyd was engaged to design the headquarters building. Annie Besant laid cornerstone on 29 August 1926 in a ceremony that was attended by Jiddu Krishnamurti and a huge crowd. In September 1927 staff members moved operations to the new structure, which was eventually named the L. W. Rogers Building. Designed in a collegiate Gothic style by Irving Kane Pond, the three-story building consists of offices, library, classroom, auditorium, meditation room, kitchen, dining room, garage, and residential wing for staff members and visitors. In 1931 Mrs. C. Shillard-Smith, commissioned painter Richard Blossom Farley to create the colorful mural of evolving life that is still on view in the two-story lobby.

The campus grew over the years, mostly through donations of land by generous members. In 1932, the headquarters estate came to be known as &quot;Olcott&quot;, in honor of co-founder Colonel Henry Steel Olcott. For several decades, postal mail was delivered simply to &quot;Olcott, Wheaton, Illinois.&quot; The property now comprises almost . The Quest Book Shop and Theosophical Publishing House are housed in the Mills Building, named after president Joy Mills. The scenic grounds are open to the public, and feature a pond, groves, gardens, and a labyrinth. Video tours of the campus are available .

== National library and archives ==

Books and periodicals have always been extremely important to Theosophists as tools for study. In 1922, L. W. Rogers established the national library, and when the headquarters building was constructed in Wheaton a two-story library was incorporated into the design. The original space was expanded in 1962-63 to add offices, meeting rooms, stacks, and basement storage.

The Henry S. Olcott Memorial Library houses books, periodicals, pamphlets, microfilm, videos, and audio recordings. The collection focuses on Theosophy, religion, science, philosophy, art, biography, and health. The reading room is open to the public six days each week; members of the Society and other library patrons can borrow library materials by mail or in person. The library belongs to the DuPage Library System MAGIC consortium and the American Theological Library Association, and works in close cooperation with the Emily Sellon Memorial Library at the New York Theosophical Society, and the Krotona Library in Ojai, California.

Archival collections include organizational records, and also special collections of papers from Boris de Zirkoff, Mary K. Neff, Fritz and Dora Kunz, and others. Records of the American Theosophical movement before 1898 are in the archives of the Theosophical Society Pasadena. A rare book room also exists in the Wheaton headquarters.

== Activities and programs ==

The national center and local groups offer lectures, study groups, workshops, and other programs to members and the general public. Subject matter is wide-ranging to facilitate the study of comparative religion, philosophy, science, health, and art. Classes have included Hatha yoga, qigong, Therapeutic touch, and many forms of meditation.

Some notable speakers at national programs have included the 14th Dalai Lama, Bede Griffiths, Lama Anagarika Govinda, Ram Dass, Stephan A. Hoeller, Huston Smith, Rupert Sheldrake, Ian Stevenson, Fritjof Capra, Amit Goswami, Ravi Ravindra, and Jean Houston. The Society has also sponsored regional and national conferences focused on special topics such as education, science, and healing. Hundreds of programs have been recorded or webcast, with many available free online. The Theosophical Community at serves as a means of conducting group discussions and other social networking.

== Publishing==

The Theosophical Society in America has published books, pamphlets, and periodicals since its earliest days. The Theosophical Publishing House publishes books under the Quest Books imprint on a broad array of topics including Theosophy, transpersonal psychology, comparative religion, ecology, spiritual growth, and health.

Quest magazine focuses on philosophy, religion, science, and the arts; articles from some past issues are available online. Messenger is a newsletter for members, providing news of organizational activities and board actions. A free monthly electronic newsletter is distributed by e-mail to members and other interested people. Many of the branch locations, federations, and retreat centers produce their own newsletters and program listings.

== Quest Book Shops ==

Quest Book Shops are commercial enterprises operated by the Theosophical Society in America and its affiliates to sell books, recordings, and other items of interest to students of Theosophy. Locations include shops in Wheaton, Illinois; New York City; Seattle; and Ojai, California.

== Affiliated organizations ==

The Theosophical Order of Service (TOS) engages in service projects in seven areas: animal welfare; art and music; ecology; family and children; healing; peace; and social service. 

Theosophical Book Gift Institute (TBGI) distributes Theosophical books free to libraries and prisoners.

Order of the Knights of the Round Table sponsors activities for children and adults, and 
Young Theosophists (YT) is a young adult group.

The Krotona Institute of Theosophy in Ojai, California, offers classes in Theosophical subjects. 

Four retreat centers facilitate fellowship and study in serene natural settings:
* Camp Indralaya on Orcas Island in Washington state 
* Far Horizons retreat center in Kings Canyon National Park in California 
* Ozark Theosophical Camp in Sulphur Springs, Arkansas 
* Pumpkin Hollow Retreat Center at Craryville, New York 

== Other Theosophical societies in the United States ==

The most prominent organizations now supporting study of Theosophy in the United States apart from the Theosophical Society in America are the Theosophical Society Pasadena, and the United Lodge of Theosophists (ULT), based in Los Angeles. These three organizations have worked together cordially, most notably at the 1993 Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in Chicago. Collaborative efforts at that event included panel discussions and audiovisual productions: &quot;Ultimate Concerns&quot;, &quot;Theosophic Worldview&quot;, and &quot;Inter-Theosophical Dialogue: the Theosophical Movement Past and Future&quot;.

The Pasadena group is composed of sections in nine countries, and offers a library, correspondence courses, study groups, publications, and an extensive array of full-text Theosophical literature on its web page. Members supplement study of the Helena Blavatsky works with writings by William Quan Judge, Katherine Tingley, Gottfried de Purucker, and others.

The ULT, founded by Robert Crosbie, is dedicated to the study of the writings of Helena Blavatsky and William Quan Judge as printed from original plates or from photographic reproductions of original texts. Twenty-two lodges and ten study groups are located in fourteen countries.

By way of comparison, the modern Theosophical Society in America bases its studies on Helena Blavatsky, but draws from a broad group of other Theosophical teachers, including Annie Besant, Alfred Percy Sinnett, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa, Ernest Wood, Clara Codd, Geoffrey Hodson, Nilakanta Sri Ram, Joy Mills, Radha Burnier, Stephan A. Hoeller, Robert Ellwood, and John Algeo.

<doc id="1121231" wikidata="Q22908089" url="?curid=1121231" title="Electronic bill payment">
<text>Electronic bill payment is a feature of online, mobile and telephone banking, similar in its effect to a giro, allowing a customer of a financial institution to transfer money from their transaction or credit card account to a creditor or vendor such as a public utility, department store or an individual to be credited against a specific account. These payments are typically executed electronically as a direct deposit through a national payment system, operated by the banks or in conjunction with the government. Payment is typically initiated by the payer but can also be set up as a direct debit.

In addition to the bill payment facility, most banks will also offer various features with their electronic bill payment systems. These include the ability to schedule payments in advance to be made on a specified date (convenient for installments such as mortgage and support payments), to save the biller information for reuse at a future time and various options for searching the recent payment history. In many cases the payment data can also be downloaded and posted directly into the customer&#x27;s accounting or personal finance software.

==History==

Although this technology was available from the mid 1990s, uptake was initially slow until internet access by households increased. By 2000, adoption of electronic bill payment systems started to dramatically increase.

==Impact==
From the consumer&#x27;s point of view, electronic payment of bills is cheaper, faster, and more convenient than writing, posting and reconciling cheques. In addition, though limitations exist, a wider range of bank accounts or credit cards can be used for the electronic payment of bills. Paying bills online allows you to use a variety of payment methods rather than the traditional cheque.

Using electronic bill presentment and payment enables businesses to fast-track customer payments and get access to funds faster, which in turn results in cash flow improvement.

For banks the advantages of electronic bill payments are a reduction in processing costs minimizing paperwork and an increase in customer loyalty. In a 2003 study, the banks said that &quot;customers who pay online show more loyalty and are more receptive to other offers&quot;.

== Bill pay in the USA ==
In the United States, most banks and credit unions offer a free service typically called &quot;bill pay.&quot; The banking customer logs into their online bank account, and submits a bill pay request, inputting all information that would be found on a physical check. Their bank will then pay the recipient electronically if they are connected to the system. Utilities are likely to be set up to receive bill pay electronically. Many recipients aren&#x27;t, so for these recipients, the bank cuts a physical check, puts the check in a stamped and addressed envelope, puts the envelope in the mail, and then sends the check to the intended recipient. The recipient then deposits the check with their bank as usual.

<doc id="1121234" wikidata="Q3216463" url="?curid=1121234" title="Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway">
<text>The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, established in 1833, and sometimes referred to as the Lake Shore, was a major part of the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s Water Level Route from Buffalo, New York, to Chicago, Illinois, primarily along the south shore of Lake Erie (in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio) and across northern Indiana. The line&#x27;s trackage remains a major rail transportation corridor used by Amtrak passenger trains and several freight lines; in 1998, its ownership was split at Cleveland, Ohio, between CSX Transportation to the east and Norfolk Southern Railway in the west.

==History==

===Early history: 1835–1869===

;Toledo to Chicago

On April 22, 1833, the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad was chartered in the Territory of Michigan, to run from the former Port Lawrence, Michigan, now Toledo, Ohio, near Lake Erie, northwest to Adrian, Michigan, on the River Raisin. The Toledo War soon gave about one-third of the route to the state of Ohio. Horse-drawn trains began operating on November 2, 1836; the horses were replaced by a newly arrived steam locomotive, &quot;Adrian&quot; No. 1, in August 1837.

The Buffalo and Mississippi Railroad was chartered in Indiana on February 6, 1835, to run from Buffalo, New York, to the Mississippi River. The name was changed on February 6, 1837, to the Northern Indiana Railroad, which would run from the eastern border of Indiana, west to Michigan City, Indiana, on Lake Michigan. Some grading between Michigan City, and La Porte, Indiana, was done in 1838, but money ran out.


Around 1838, the state of Michigan started to build the Southern Railroad, running from Monroe, Michigan, on Lake Erie, west to New Buffalo, Michigan, on Lake Michigan. The first section, from Monroe, west to Petersburg, Michigan, opened in 1839. Extensions opened in 1840, to Adrian, and 1843, to Hillsdale, Michigan. On May 9, 1846, the partially completed line was sold to the Michigan Southern Rail Road, which changed the planned western terminal to Chicago, using the charter of the Northern Indiana Railroad. The grading that had been done was not used, as the grade was too steep, and instead the original Buffalo and Mississippi Railroad charter was used west of La Porte. The Michigan Southern leased the Erie and Kalamazoo on August 1, 1849, giving it a branch to Toledo, and a connection to planned railroads to the east.

Due to lobbying by the Michigan Central Railroad, a competitor of the Michigan Southern, the latter&#x27;s charter prevented it from going within of the Indiana state line east of Constantine, Michigan. However, the most practical route went closer than two miles, west of White Pigeon, Michigan. To allow for this, Judge Stanfield, of South Bend, Indiana, bought the right-of-way from White Pigeon to the state line, and leased it to the railroad company for about 10 years, until the charter was modified to allow the company to own it.

The Northern Indiana and Chicago Railroad was chartered on November 30, 1850. Its initial tracks, from the Michigan Southern at the state line running west-southwest to Elkhart, Indiana, then west through Osceola, Indiana, and Mishawaka, Indiana, to South Bend, opened on October 4, 1851. The full line west to Chicago, opened on February 20, 1852, (running to the predecessor of Englewood Union Station, together with the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad). A more direct line was soon planned from Elkhart, east to Toledo, and the Northern Indiana Railroad was chartered in Ohio, on March 3, 1851. On July 8, 1853, the Ohio and Indiana companies merged, and on February 7, 1855, the Northern Indiana and Chicago Railroad and the Buffalo and Mississippi Railroad were merged into the Northern Indiana Railroad. On April 25, 1855, that company in turn merged with the Michigan Southern Rail Road to form the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad. In 1858, the new alignment (Northern Indiana Air Line) from Elkhart, east to Air Line Junction, in Toledo, was completed. The company now owned a main line from Chicago to Toledo, with an alternate route through southern Michigan, east of Elkhart, and a branch off that alternate to Monroe. Also included was the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad, leased July 1, 1856, and providing a branch from Toledo, past Monroe, to Detroit, Michigan.
====Erie to Cleveland====
The Franklin Canal Company was chartered on May 21, 1844, and built a railroad from Erie, Pennsylvania, southwest to the Ohio border. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad was incorporated February 18, 1848, to build northeast from Cleveland, to join the Canal Company&#x27;s railroad at the state line, and the full line from Erie to Cleveland, opened November 20, 1852. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula bought the Franklin Canal Company on June 20, 1854.

====Buffalo to Erie====
The Buffalo and State Line Railroad was incorporated October 13, 1849, and opened January 1, 1852, from Dunkirk,New York, west to Pennsylvania. The rest of the line from Dunkirk to Buffalo, opened on February 22. The Erie and North East Railroad was chartered April 12, 1842, to build the part from the state line west to Erie, and opened on January 19, 1852. On November 16, 1853, an agreement was made between the two railroads, which had been built at broad gauge, to relay the rails at to match the Franklin Canal Company&#x27;s railroad (see below) on the other side of Erie, and for the Buffalo and State Line to operate the Erie and Northeast. This would result in through passengers no longer having to change trains at Erie, and on December 7, 1853, the Erie Gauge War began between the railroads and the townspeople. On February 1, 1854, the relaying was finished and the first train passed through Erie. On May 15, 1867, the two companies between Buffalo and Erie merged to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad.

====Cleveland to Toledo====

The Junction Railroad was chartered March 2, 1846, to build from Cleveland, west to Toledo. The Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland Railroad was chartered March 7, 1850, to build from Toledo, east to Grafton, Ohio, on the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. The latter company opened on January 24, 1853, finally forming a continuous Buffalo-Chicago line. On September 1, the two companies merged to form the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad, with the Junction Railroad becoming the Northern Division and the Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland, the Southern Division. The Northern Division opened from Cleveland, west to Sandusky, Ohio, on October 24, 1853, and the rest of the way to Toledo, on April 24, 1855. The Northern Division was abandoned west of Sandusky, due to lack of business, but the track was relaid in 1872, merging with the Southern Division, at Millbury, Ohio, east of Toledo. In 1866, the Southern Division, east of Oberlin, Ohio, was abandoned and a new line was built to Elyria, Ohio, on the Northern Division, ending the use of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad.

====Consolidations====
In October 1867, the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad leased the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad. The CP&amp;A changed its name to the Lake Shore Railway on March 31, 1868, and on February 11, 1869, the Lake Shore absorbed the Cleveland and Toledo. On April 6, the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad and Lake Shore merged to form the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, which absorbed the Buffalo and Erie Railroad on June 22, giving one company the whole route from Buffalo to Chicago. The main route passed through Dunkirk; Erie; Ashtabula, Ohio; Cleveland; Toledo; Waterloo, Indiana; and South Bend. An alternate route, the Sandusky Division, in Ohio, ran north of the main line between Elyria, and Millbury, Ohio, not all track was laid until 1872. From Toledo to Elkhart, the Old Road ran to the north, through southern Michigan, and the through route was called the Air Line Division or Northern Indiana Air Line. Along with various branches that had been acquired (see below), the Monroe Branch ran east from Adrian, to Monroe, where it intersected the leased Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad. At some point the original line to Toledo was abandoned west of the branch to Jackson, Michigan, the Palmyra and Jacksonburgh Railroad, with the new connection at Lenawee Junction, the crossing between that branch and the line to Monroe.

The railroad established its first significant repair shop in 1851 along Mason Street in Elkhart, Indiana. These shops were occasionally expanded and upgraded in the 1800s and early 1900s until employment reached about 1,500. A second shop site was established in 1874 in Collinwood on the northeast side of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1901, the railroad bought a new property in Collinwood for $2 million to build a much larger repair center that by the 1920s employed more than 2,000 people. In 1913, a freight car repair shop was established in Ashtabula, Ohio, to maintain the large roster of ore and coal cars operating at the nearby port. In 1952, as the railroad was converting its motive power from steam to diesel, the repair shops were consolidated at Collinwood.

===Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway: 1869–1914===

Around 1877, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and his New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, gained a majority of stock of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The line provided an ideal extension of the New York Central main line from Buffalo, west to Chicago, along with the route across southern Ontario, the Canada Southern Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad.

===New York Central Railroad: 1914–1968===
On December 22, 1914, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad merged with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway to form the New York Central Railroad. While the original main line was to the south of Sandusky Bay, between Toledo and Elyria, the northern alignment, the Sandusky Division, eventually became the main line.

===Post-NYC: 1968–present===
In 1968, the New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad to form the Penn Central Transportation Company, Penn Central, which two years later, filed for bankruptcy. In 1976, it became part of Conrail. In 1976, the Southern Division, from Elyria to Millbury, was abandoned, with parts of the former right of way now in use as a recreational trail, the North Coast Inland Trail. Under Conrail, the Lake Shore main line was part of the New York City–Chicago, Chicago Line.

In 1998, Conrail was split between CSX and Norfolk Southern. The Chicago Line east of Cleveland, went to CSX, and was split into several subdivisions: the Lake Shore Subdivision, from Buffalo, to Erie, the Erie West Subdivision, from Erie, to east of Cleveland, and the Cleveland Terminal Subdivision, into downtown Cleveland. From the former Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad junction in Cleveland, west to Chicago, the line is now Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Chicago Line.
Amtrak&#x27;s New York City–Chicago &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; runs along the full route from Buffalo west. The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; joins in Cleveland, at the &quot;Amtrak Connection&quot; from the former Pennsylvania Railroad, C&amp;P line, just east of the present Cleveland Station (MP 181), on its way from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. Passenger trains along the route originally terminated at LaSalle Street Station, but now run to Union Station, switching to the parallel former Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, at a crossover in Whiting, Indiana, Indiana, () to get there.

==Branches==

A major branch of the LS&amp;MS extended from Northeastern Ohio, to the coal and oil fields of northwestern Pennsylvania, terminating near Brookville. Originally the line extended to the oil fields and refineries on the Allegheny River, at Franklin, and Oil City, Pennsylvania.

The line was later extended from Polk Junction, west of Franklin, to Rose, Pennsylvania, just west of Brookville. Also added was a connector south from Franklin, to the Allegheny River crossing on the new extension. This line included perhaps the most impressive engineering structures on the LS&amp;MS, as well as the later NYC, with several large trestles, bridges, and tunnels, near Brookville, including a bridge-tunnel-bridge-tunnel-fill combination near Piney, Pennsylvania, and two magnificent trestles west of Brookville, near Corsica, Pennsylvania. The New York Central used trackage rights over the Pennsylvania Railroad and the B&amp;O Railroad to connect from Rose to NYC lines at Clearfield, Pennsylvania.

There were several mines on this line near Brookville, as well as a connection to the Lake Erie, Franklin and Clarion (LEF&amp;C) at Sutton, Pennsylvania, and connections to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and via the Pennsy, to the Pittsburgh &amp; Shawmut, at Brookville.

Once coal traffic dried up in the late 1990s, this line was severed and cut back to the mine at Piney. Many of the larger trestles were taken out in the late 2000s, reportedly on orders of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), although the bridge across the Clarion River survived, as of 2015.

<text>Crabwalk (2002), published in German as Im Krebsgang, is a novel by German author Günter Grass, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999. Born in 1927 in the Free City of Danzig (now known as Gdańsk, Poland), Grass explores the effects of the past on the present: in this novel, he interweaves various strands and combines fact and fiction in exploring the lack of attention to German victimhood in their losses in World War II. 

He uses fiction to explore the lasting influence of such major events as the early 1945 sinking of the ship &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; by a Soviet submarine, in which more than 9300 people died, most civilians and thousands of children. He believes that the failure to recognize the cost of such losses as the ship sinking to the Germans helped create a rise of neo-Nazi movements.

==Title==
The title, &quot;Crabwalk&quot;, defined by Grass as &quot;scuttling backward to move forward,&quot; refers to various events, some occurring at the same time, which are the same events that would lead to the eventual disaster. Crabwalk might also imply a more abstract glance at history, in order to allow a people to move forward. The protagonist&#x27;s awkward relationships with his mother and his estranged son, explored via the crabbed process of scouring the wreckage of history for therapeutic insight, is another expression of the title.

==Plot summary==

The narrator of the novella is journalist Paul Pokriefke. He was born on 30 January 1945, the day that the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was sunk by a Soviet submarine in the last year of World War II. His young mother-to-be, Tulla Pokriefke (born in Danzig, was featured in two earlier parts of the &quot;Danzig Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; and &quot;Dog Years&quot;). She is among the more than 10,000 passengers on the ship, who included a majority of evacuees and some military, and the relatively few hundred survivors. Tulla says in the novel that Paul was born the same moment the ship sank, when she had been rescued and was on board a torpedo boat. 

Paul feels that his life is strongly influenced by these events, above all because Tulla repeatedly urges him to fulfill his &#x27;duty&#x27; and to commemorate the event in writing. In the course of his research, Paul discovers by chance that his estranged son Konrad (Konny) has taken an interest in the sinking of the &quot;Wilhem Gustloff&quot; as an expression of Nazi thinking. 

For years Konny had lived with his mother after his parents divorced. He created a website (&#x27;blutzeuge.de&#x27;) by which he explores the 1936 murder of Swiss Nazi leader Wilhelm Gustloff, and the sinking of the ship named for him. He creates a dialogue in which he adopts the role of Gustloff. Another young man, Wolfgang Stremplin, takes the role online of David Frankfurter, Jewish assassin of Gustloff.
The two men eventually meet in person in Schwerin, the hometown of Konny. (A memorial stands to the historic activist Gustloff.) The meeting takes place on 20 April 1997; more than 100 years after Hitler&#x27;s birth on that date in 1889. Wolfgang takes on a Jewish persona for his role playing. He spits three times on the memorial to Gustloff, a Nazi activist, thus desecrating it in Konny&#x27;s eyes. Konny shoots him dead, mirroring Frankfurter&#x27;s shooting of Gustloff. Afterward he surrenders to the police and says, &quot;I shot because I am a German&quot;. (By contrast, Frankfurter had said, &quot;I shot because I am a Jew&quot;.)

The narrator realises that his imprisoned son has become a new style of martyr. He is celebrated as such by neo-Nazis on the Internet.

==Characters==

===Konrad Pokriefke===

Konrad (known as &quot;Konny&quot;) is the son of Paul Pokriefke and Gabi; after his parents&#x27; divorce, Konny is brought up by his left-wing mother and has little contact with his father. Highly intelligent, he is characterised as a &#x27;loner&#x27; by his parents. He has a very good relationship with his grandmother Tulla, who tells him stories of the ship, and with whom he eventually goes to live. 

Via his website, he forms a love-hate relationship with Wolfgang Stremplin: divided by their political views, they are nevertheless connected by similar personalities and a love for table-tennis. At his murder trial, Konny claims to have nothing against Jews, but says that he considers their presence among Aryan populations to be as &#x27;foreign body&#x27;. His father believes that the son has a &#x27;slow-burning&#x27; hatred for the Jews.

===Tulla Pokriefke===

Tulla (short form of Ursula) is short and thin; she was a young woman when her hair turned white after she survived the ship sinking. She is attractive to men even into old age. Politically she is an extremist of varied views: on the one hand she repeatedly praises the &#x27;classless society&#x27; of the Strength Through Joy ship and supports her grandson even after he kills his friend; on the other, she became a model functionary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in East Germany and wept at the news of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death.

Tulla speaks with a strong accent (a form of Low German known as &#x27;Langfursch&#x27;, after the part of Danzig she is from). As someone who represents a line of continuity with Pokriefke&#x27;s family&#x27;s lost &quot;Heimat&quot; of Danzig, as well as the &quot;lost world&quot; of her ancestral Kashubian people, she has mysterious and almost magical powers of persuasion. Several critics see Tulla as a siren type of character with the power to lure other people, especially men, to her views.

For her, the cruise ship &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, built in 1937 to put the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (people&#x27;s community) into practice by allowing ordinary Germans to take free vacations abroad, was a floating utopia. For a brief moment it supported a &quot;classless&quot; society where everyone was cared for. Most Germans could not afford a vacation abroad in the interwar period, owing to the undervalued &quot;Reichsmark&quot;, so a voyage aboard the ship was considered to be a great privilege. After the ship was launched, a number of German families who were considered &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; (&quot;National Comrades&quot;-i.e people who belonged to the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;) were allowed to take a free vacation aboard the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;. The people selected for a voyage on the ship were never &quot;Gemeinschaftsfremde&quot; (&quot;Community Aliens&quot;, i.e those who not belong to the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;). The &quot;Volksgenossen&quot; families selected were meant to provide a good cross-section of German society: families who were working class and middle class; Catholic and Protestant; and from northern and southern Germany, all sailing together on the ship to provide proof that German society under the Nazi regime had indeed become one. For Tulla, the ideal of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, with German society becoming a gigantic extended family, is her ideal society. She thought this was achieved with the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;. 

She was not disturbed by the fact that people considered to be &quot;Gemeinschaftsfremde&quot; were excluded from the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. Tulla&#x27;s views are those of the &quot;Hitler Youth generation&quot;, who came of age in the 1930s and remembered their youth as a happy time. They often seemed unable to understand why others had more jaundiced memories of the period. Tulla grieves not only the loss of life from the ship sinking, but also the loss of what the ship represented. She sees East Germany as another model of her favorite utopian society, where everyone was alleged to be cared for, although her feelings were stronger for what the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was said to represent.

She seeks to put the story of the ship into the public domain, as it was long subject to silence. When her attempts to persuade her son to write about the disaster fail, she turns her attention to her grandson, who creates a website about it. After he is threatened by neo-Nazi skinheads, she gives him a gun.

===The old one===

The mysterious figure of the old one stands between Grass and the narrator Paul. Belonging to the generation of those who fled to the West after the end of the war, he encourages Paul to write of the sinking because he himself failed to do so. The narrator refers to him as his &quot;employer&quot; or &quot;boss&quot;. The possibility of identifying him with Grass serves to prevent the equation of the narrator with the author.

==Reception==
==Analysis==
The novel suggests that, because Germans and people outside their country have largely ignored the subject of German suffering in World War Two, political extremists have tapped into people feeling overlooked and thus gained a platform in current society. Grass believes that events that represent the full German experience, such as the major losses of thousands of innocent people in the ship sinking, should become part of the popular memory of the past and the war. 

Paul Pokriefke, the narrator of &quot;Crabwalk&quot;, is reluctant to talk about the sinking of the ship. He begins to talk about it only after discovering a neo-Nazi website that uses the sinking as a way to glorify the Third Reich. 

Critic Stephen Brase suggests that the main theme of the novel is parental (and generational) failure, as Paul and his ex-wife Gabi are unable to prevent their son from becoming a Nazi. Brase considered the characters of Paul and Gabi to be emblematic of the post-war generation who came of age in the 1960s and wanted to create a better Germany, but were unable to make lasting positive changes. Grass portrayed Paul as well-meaning, but unable to make the changes he wants because for the first half of the novel he cannot speak of the sinking of the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;. Even when Paul does speak of the sinking, he stresses that some of its aspects, such as the deaths of the passengers in the interior, who were unable to escape because the ship sank rapidly and in icy waters, are simply too horrible to put into words. In a different way, the parents of Wolfgang Stremplin are shown as having failed because their son&#x27;s philo-Semitism, a result of guilt over the Holocaust, is portrayed as deeply felt but also somewhat silly and absurd. The last lines of the novel are: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t end. It will never end&quot;. 

In a critical 2002 review in &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Thomas Schmitt rejected Grass&#x27;s thesis of a &quot;national taboo&quot; against the memory of German victimization in the war. He notes that families of Germans who fled or were expelled from their longtime homes in other national territories in the postwar period have kept alive the memories of these lost homelands. He also noted that conservative German historians have always written at length about the losses of Germans, including deaths in the military, civilian victims of bombed cities or sunk ships, and the losses of tens of thousands who were expelled from Eastern Europe and often attacked along the way. 

But Schmitt also accepted that aspects of recent German history made it difficult for the people to incorporate the memory of German victimization into their memory of the past. Schmitt noted that the &quot;68ers&quot;, as the generation who came of age in the late 1960s are known, tended to point an accusing finger at their parents and grandparents for all the things that they did and did not do in the Nazi era. The 68ers were reluctant to accept the image of their parents/grandparents as victims. Schmitt also noted that the cause of expellees was championed by the West German government under Konrad Adenauer, who rejected the Oder-Neisse line, but the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of Willy Brandt and the acceptance of the Oder-Neisse line in 1970 resulted in the West German state refusing expellees and their demands for the &quot;right to a homeland&quot;. Schmitt noted that the expellee groups hurt their cause by demands for a revanchist foreign policy directed at taking back parts of Poland that Germany had once controlled. This made the memory of their suffering difficult to incorporate into the memory of the past in an acceptable way. For all these reasons, Schmitt believed that &quot;Crabwalk&quot; had come too late, and that it was unlikely to influence the memory of the past in the way that Grass wanted.
While acknowledging the terrible loss of life in the ship sinking Schmitt noted that the next day, a Nazi-directed death march ended in the same area, with a massacre of survivors at the edge of the sea. The SS had forced the inmates of Stutthof concentration camp (outside of Danzig) on a death march that at the shore of the Baltic Sea. Survivors were shot down there into the crashing waves. 

Schmitt also noted that the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was carrying military personnel and weapons, making it a legitimate wartime target for the Soviets under international law. While most of the passengers were civilians, the ship did not carry Red Cross markings. By contrast, the Stutthof death march was an act of genocide. Schmitt argued that the sinking of the ship was not an act of genocide and should not be remembered as comparable to the death march. 

Grass was among the &quot;&quot;Flakhelfer&quot; generation&quot;, those Germans under the Third Reich who were too young to be drafted into the Wehrmacht, but were usually assigned as gunner assistants to Luftwaffe anti-aircraft batteries that were used against the Allied bombers during the strategical bombing offensive. 

Critic Fritz J. Raddatz, one of the leaders of the student protests of the late 1960s, said in a 2006 interview that Grass was too harsh in &quot;Crabwalk&quot; towards the &quot;68ers&quot;. He said that Grass&#x27;s portrayal of their efforts to change German society as a failure was most unfair. Raddatz argued that the portrayal of the &quot;68ers&quot; as well meaning but ineffectual intellectuals, due to their own flaws, was distorted and reflected Grass&#x27;s personal disapproval of the protest movements in the 1960s.

Many reviewers felt that the &quot;spectacular success&quot; of &quot;Crabwalk&quot; would lead to a new national discourse that would place the image of Germans as victims of the war as the dominant memory of the past. German journalist Ralph Giordano, who suffered persecution in the Nazi era for having a Jewish mother, ranked &quot;Crabwalk&quot; as one of Grass&#x27;s best novels. He agreed that events such as the sinking of the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; should be remembered and mourned as a terrible chapter of the war. But, Giordano insisted that the war begun by Germany was the cause of ethnic Germans being expelled from Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. He noted that the 1950 charter of the main expellee group was an &quot;instrument perfectly suited for repressing historical facts&quot;, as it suggested that Poland had attacked Germany in 1939, rather than the facts. 

Giordano argued that Grass&#x27;s intentions in &quot;Crabwalk&quot; were honorable, but his argument could be distorted into an assertion of moral equivalence, as if there were no differences between the actions of the Axis and Allied states. He opposed this way of rendering the past. 

Critic Siegfrid Mews wrote that British reviewers of &quot;Crabwalk&quot; had praised the novel for its attention to the &quot;forgotten victims of ethnic cleansing&quot;, and suggested that the &quot;sense of loss&quot; that the novel embraced was a sign of the growing &quot;normalisation of Germany&quot;. A review in the conservative &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, noted that the &quot;9, 000 people who died [on the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;]-six times more than in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster-were largely ignored by the country&#x27;s literary elite and to an extent by the historians&quot;. Mews noted that many British reviewers seemed to embrace the novel&#x27;s message that the story of German wartime should be part of the memory of the past in a manner that seemed to be contrary to Grass&#x27;s intentions.&#x27;

British critic Julian Preece noted that the sinking in &quot;Crabwalk&quot; became a symbol for &quot;Der Flucht&quot; (&quot;The Flight&quot;) - the massive, chaotic and catastrophic flight of Germans from the eastern parts of Germany in the winter of 1944-1945 as the Red Army advanced into the &quot;Reich&quot; toward Berlin. Though Grass noted there were soldiers abroad the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, he emphasized that the majority of dead were civilians, and that Captain Marinesko of the had no reason to believe that the cruise ship was anything other than a civilian ship when he torpedoed it. Preece believed that Grass thought the ship sinking to be unjustified. 

In the novel, Grass notes that the story of the sinking was forbidden in East Germany. He compared this to apparent prohibitions in West Germany against discussing German victimization in the war since the Brandt era. 

The novel explores Paul Pokriefke&#x27;s attempts to sort out the various meanings attached to the sinking, including the Soviet viewpoint as represented by Captain Marinesko. On the wrong side of politics, he was sentenced and imprisoned in a Siberian Gulag camp for a period after the war. In the novel, he is portrayed as both a perpetrator and a victim, providing a degree of moral ambiguity. Other German accounts have represented him as a heartles monster who sent some 9, 600 people to their deaths by sinking the ship. 

Notably, the book correctly notes that the three captains commanding the ship were criminally negligent in not having enough lifeboats aboard to accommodate the overloaded ship. The decision to keep the ship&#x27;s lights on at night, illuminating it and creating higher risk, has never been explained. Had the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; had the proper number of lifeboats, more lives would have been saved while if the lights had been turned off, the ship might very well had escaped been sunk altogether. 

Most of the children went down with the ship and died. Grass incorporated the findings that the three captains all had places in the lifeboats. 

Preece felt that the most vivid parts of &quot;Crabwalk&quot; were the &quot;death in the snow&quot; segments, tracing the historic &quot;Der Flucht&quot; as millions of German civilians trekked westwards in panic-stricken columns over the snow and ice in the winter of 1944-45 to escape the invading Soviet troops. Many dropped dead during their epic flight. Preece says that the debate about the assassination of Wilhelm Gustloff in Switzerland, which takes up much of the novel, was &quot;...really a distraction from the horror in the snow experienced by the refugees in the winter treks to the west, which claimed the lives of so many in such degrading circumstances&quot;.

South African novelist J.M Coetzee said that Tulla was Grass&#x27;s most memorable character. Despite her questionable political views she is undeniably a victim; she says of the sinking: 
&quot;A thing like that you can never forget. It never leaves you. It&#x27;s not just in my dreams, that cry [of passengers drowning in the Baltic] that spread over the waters...And of them little children among the ice floes&quot;. 

Coetzee said that Tulla&#x27;s politics may be &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;unrefined&quot;, but were &quot;deeply felt&quot;. He further said that Grass made a &quot;considered argument&quot; that people such as Tulla should be allowed &quot;to have their heroes and martyrs and memorials and ceremonies of remembrance&quot;, as repression of any kind leads to &quot;unpredictable consequences&quot;.

<text>Mike Petke (born January 30, 1976) is an American former soccer player and coach who was most recently head coach of Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake. Prior to his tenure with Real Salt Lake, he was head coach of the New York Red Bulls, leading them to the Supporters&#x27; Shield in 2013.

==Playing career==

===College===
Petke attended St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School in West Islip, New York, where he was selected as an All-American, before moving on to play college soccer in Southern Connecticut State University. In 1995, he led SCSU to the NCAA Division II National title and was named Conference Rookie of the Year. In 1997, he was named New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) Defensive Player of the Year and was a consensus NSCAA/Umbro First Team All-America selection.

===Professional===
Petke was drafted by the MetroStars in the first round of the 1998 MLS College Draft. He made his MLS debut on April 17, 1998, in a 1–0 win over Chicago Fire. He spent the first five years of his career with MetroStars, becoming the only constant under an ever-changing regime of coaches and players. A fan favorite, Petke ended his career as the MetroStars/Red Bulls all-time leader in games played with 169 (197 in all competitions).

Petke gained notoriety on August 20, 2000, four days after Tampa Bay Mutiny forward Mamadou Diallo broke the ribs of MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann. Petke, who rarely scored goals, scored in the MetroStars win over Colorado, and unveiled a T-shirt that said &quot;August 16: Crime of the Century&quot; on the front and &quot;Revenge is Coming&quot; on the back. While such support for a fallen comrade was welcomed by teammates and MetroStars fans, it was frowned upon by the league and Petke was fined for his efforts. Diallo, however, received no disciplinary action following the injuries to Ammann.

After an outstanding season in 2000, in which Petke helped lead the club to the Eastern Division title, Petke went on a two-week trial with Bundesliga side Bayern Munich. After his trial with Bayern, another German club 1. FC Kaiserslautern offered Petke a contract, but Petke elected to remain with MetroStars.

Petke, a three-time MLS All-Star, was traded to D.C. United with a draft pick and an allocation for Eddie Pope, Jaime Moreno, and Richie Williams. He won the MLS Cup with DC during the 2004 season. Petke was then traded to Colorado Rapids in May 2005 in a three-team deal. He helped stabilize the Colorado backline and was a key player in helping the Rapids reach the Western Conference Finals in 2005. He remained a fixture in the heart of the Rapids defense for the next three years.

On November 26, 2008, the New York Red Bulls, the former MetroStars, signed Petke on waivers, and agreed to terms on a new multi-year agreement. The move brought Petke back to New York six years after leaving the MetroStars. In his first season with the Red Bulls, Petke appeared in 19 regular season matches. On March 20, 2010, Petke scored the second goal for the Red Bulls in a 3–1 victory against Santos FC, which was the first match played at the new Red Bull Arena.
During the 2010 season Petke announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He concluded his last professional season appearing in 16 regular season matches, and helped New York capture its second Eastern Division regular season title. In thirteen years in MLS, Petke scored thirteen regular season goals and added four assists.

===International===
Petke had two caps with the U.S. national team, the first coming on June 7, 2001, against Ecuador.

Petke also captained the United States Under-21 team, and was a member of the U.S. squad that competed in the 1995 World University Games in Japan.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from the game, Petke took a job as Manager of Business Operations with the New York Red Bulls. On January 24, 2013, after tenures as an assistant coach and then interim head coach, Petke was named as the club&#x27;s head coach. In the 2013 MLS season, Petke guided the Red Bulls to their first major trophy, clinching the Supporters&#x27; Shield with a final matchday 5–2 win over the Chicago Fire.

Petke once again led the Red Bulls to relative success in the 2014 MLS season, as the team made the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing there to the New England Revolution. Nonetheless, Petke was fired by the club in January 2015. Petke&#x27;s firing was met with huge backlash by Red Bulls supporters.

After leaving the Red Bulls, Petke spent time as a color commentator for soccer on ONE World Sports, and also worked as the Director of Coaching for the New Jersey State Youth Soccer Association.

Petke was hired as head coach of Real Monarchs in the United Soccer League on December 22, 2016. Just over three months later, on March 29, 2017, Petke was named the new head coach of the Monarchs&#x27; parent club, Real Salt Lake, replacing Jeff Cassar.

On August 11, 2019, Real Salt Lake announced that it had terminated Petke&#x27;s contract as head coach, following an incident between Petke and match officials during the 2019 Leagues Cup where he was accused of repeatedly using homophobic language toward the head official.

<text>Charles Jeremiah Wells (25 January 1799 – 17 February 1879) was an English poet.

==Family==
His parents were James Turner Wells (1772 - 1838) and Jane Sears (? - 1832). On 15 July 1825 he married Emily Jane Hill (1807 - 1872), the daughter of a school-teacher.
Their children were:
*Emily Jane (1827 - 1885)
*Anna Maria (1828 - 1903)
*Florence Hazlitt (1832 - 1835)
*Charles James Llewellyn (1834 - 1836)
*Florence Llewellyn (1837 - ?)
* Charles De Ville Wells (b. 1841 -1922), gambler and criminal.

==Life==

He was born in Pentonville, London, on 25 January 1799. He was educated at Cowden Clarke&#x27;s school in Edmonton, with Tom Keats, younger brother of the poet John Keats, and Richard Henry Horne. He became acquainted with John Keats, and was the friend who sent him some roses, to whom Keats wrote a sonnet on 29 June 1816: &quot;When, O Wells! thy roses came to me, My sense with their deliciousness was spelled; Soft voices had they, that, with tender plea, Whisper&#x27;d of peace and truth and friendliness unquelled.&quot;

Wells soon afterwards played a practical joke on the dying Tom Keats, and reappears in the elder poet&#x27;s correspondence as &quot;that degraded Wells&quot;. Wells was in literary emulation of Keats and John Hamilton Reynolds, and his early writings were the result of this. In 1822 he published &quot;Stories after Nature--or rather, in the manner of Boccaccio, tempered by that of Leigh Hunt&quot;. At the end of 1823, using the pseudonym H. L. Howard, he published the Biblical drama &quot;Of Joseph and his Brethren&quot; (dated 1824). For the next three years Wells saw William Hazlitt, he said, every night, but the two men were estranged during 1827. When Hazlitt died, in September 1830, Wells took Horne to see his dead friend, and afterwards raised a monument to the memory of Hazlitt in St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho.

His two books were almost unnoticed. Wells was now practising as a solicitor in London, but he thought that his health was failing and proceeded to South Wales, where he occupied himself with shooting, fishing and writing poetry until 1835, when he relocated to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire.

In 1841 he left England, never to visit it again. He settled at Quimper, in Brittany, where he lived for some years. He published a story named &quot;Claribel&quot; in 1845, and one or two minor stories later, but several tragedies and a great deal of miscellaneous verse belonging to these years are lost. Wells stated in a letter to Horne (November 1877) that he had composed eight or ten volumes of poetry during his life, but that, having failed to find a publisher for any of them, he burned the manuscripts at his wife&#x27;s death. The only work he had retained was a revised form of &quot;Joseph and his Brethren&quot;, which was praised in 1838 by the author Thomas Wade, and again by Horne, in his &quot;New Spirit of the Age&quot;, in 1844. The drama was then once more forgotten, until in 1863 it was read and praised by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

From that time &quot;Joseph and his Brethren&quot; became well-known among poets. Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a study of it in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; in 1875, and the drama itself was reprinted in 1876. Between 1876 and 1878 Wells added various scenes, which became possessed by Buxton Fornian, who published one of them in 1895. After leaving Quimper, Wells went to reside at Marseilles, where he had a professorship.

Swinburne said that there are lines in Wells &quot;which might more naturally be mistaken, even by an expert, for the work of the young Shakespeare, than any to be gathered elsewhere in the fields of English poetry&quot;. In 1909 a reprint was published of &quot;Joseph and his Brethren&quot;, with Swinburne&#x27;s essay, and reminiscences by Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton.

Harper was born in Oldham and raised in Glasgow&#x27;s Possilpark area, attending St. Theresa&#x27;s Primary and St. Augustine&#x27;s Secondary School.

==Playing career==

===Hibernian===
Harper played for youth club Hutchison Vale in Edinburgh before he was signed by Hibernian and made his professional debut aged just 17. As a black footballer, Harper was in a small minority within Scottish football. He was unhappy that having claimed Gary Mackay had racially abused him during an Edinburgh derby game in November 1996, the SFA did not take action in response to his complaint.

===England===
Derby County manager Jim Smith signed Harper for £300,000 in September 1998. Harper scored two goals for Derby; one against Liverpool in the league and one against Swansea City in the FA Cup. He was loaned out to Walsall in December 1999 for the remainder of the season.

His spell at Walsall was cut short when Portsmouth made an offer of £300,000 for his services in March 2000. Harper moved to Fratton Park having started only seven games for Derby. The Scottish under-21 international soon settled into the team at Portsmouth, but missed much of the 2000–01 season with a shin splints problem. In 2001–02 he had the dubious honour of having been sent off (twice) more times than he scored (once). However, he was a crucial member of the side that won the First Division title in 2002–03.

Despite his impressive part in Portsmouth&#x27;s promotion, Harper was loaned out to Norwich in September 2003. His loan spell at Carrow Road was initially for one month but was extended to three months. He played well at Norwich, but was also sent off for a two-footed tackle on Luciano Zavagno in a match against Derby County. He contributed nine league appearances during Norwich&#x27;s 2003/04 season after which they were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions in his absence. On his return to Fratton Park he made only nine appearances for Portsmouth in the 2003–04 season. After failing to regain his place at the start of the 2004–05 season he was loaned to Leicester City.

In January 2005 was sold to Stoke City. Despite starting his Stoke career impressively, Harper was dogged by injuries that prevented him challenging for a first team place. He scored once for Stoke, in a 3–1 win over Norwich City. Harper was loaned to Carlisle United in October 2006 and then Walsall, whom he had played for on loan earlier in his career. He was released by Stoke manager Tony Pulis in May 2007.

===Return to Scotland===
On 7 July 2007, Harper opted to join Dunfermline Athletic, of the Scottish First Division. He scored the winning goal against Stirling Albion on 25 August 2007 and played in Dunfermline&#x27;s UEFA Cup matches at home 16 August and away 30 August against BK Hacken FC of Sweden. Harper&#x27;s season was rather inconsistent, though on 25 March 2008 he scored a hat-trick in a re-arranged fixture against First Division strugglers Stirling Albion.

==Coaching career==
Following the departure of their Under 20s coach, SPFL side Airdrieonians appointed Harper as the replacement in July 2015. He left this post in September 2015. Harper has also set up his own football academy based in Stepps.

In November 2015, Thorniewood United manager and former Hibernian team-mate Andy Frame, persuaded Harper to come out of retirement and join the club in a player-coach role.

Harper was appointed Albion Rovers manager in November 2018. He became the first black, Asian or minority ethnic manager of a Scottish club since Márcio Máximo in 2003. A struggling Rovers side won none of their first 12 matches under Harper, but then won five of their last nine fixtures in 2018–19 Scottish League Two to avoid relegation. In May 2019, Harper extended his contract with the club to the end of the 2019–20 season. Albion again avoided relegation by finishing ninth in that season, but Harper decided to leave the club at the end of his contract in May 2020. Harper later revealed that, despite having avoided relegation again with a very poor 9th-place finish, he had been offered reduced terms, in line with a greatly reduced club budget due to prevailing circumstances, to stay and believed the board could match the ambition he had for the club.

In June 2020, Harper appeared in a special podcast panel discussing his experiences of racism in football with A View from the Terrace host Craig Fowler.

On 15 November 2022, Lochee United appoint Hibs first team scout Kevin Harper as new manager.

On 4 June 2023 Kevin Harper join Thorniewood United as player-coach.

<doc id="1121258" wikidata="Q1143082" url="?curid=1121258" title="Cuckmere River">
<text>The Cuckmere River rises near Heathfield in East Sussex, England on the southern slopes of the Weald. The name of the river probably comes from an Old English word meaning &quot;fast-flowing&quot;, since it descends over in its initial . It flows into the English Channel, and has the only undeveloped river mouth on the Sussex coast.

==Description==
The river has many tributaries at its upper end, the principal one being the River Bull; and its main channel begins at Hellingly. After crossing the Low Weald area of farmland, the Cuckmere cuts through the South Downs in its own valley. It reaches the English Channel at Cuckmere Haven, between Seaford and the Seven Sisters cliff face. The lower part of its course in the floodplain is marked by meandering. The Cuckmere Valley Nature Reserve is located in the lower estuary portion of the river. The valley is very important for nature conservation. It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is part of the South Downs National Park.

==History and environmental issues==
The Cuckmere Valley civil parish takes its name from the river. In the 19th century, defensive measures were taken to prevent flooding of the upper valley. Shingle was regularly dug from the mouth of the river and the banks were made higher. In 1846, the course of the river was straightened in an artificial cut; the cut mostly prevented flooding upstream, which used to reach to the village of Alfriston. It also provided support for irrigation. In addition, raised river banks, or levees, were constructed to protect areas from flooding.

In recent decades, the area has become a major tourist destination, with tourism contributing to the local economy more than does agriculture. The river also stands at the foot of the current Litlington White Horse carved in 1924.

In 2001, the Cuckmere Estuary Partnership was established as a collaboration of the National Trust, Natural England, Environment Agency, East Sussex County Council, Sussex Wildlife Trust, and various other environmental and conservation groups. They are working together to create long-term plans for the natural area. Government guidelines prohibit continuing to maintain hard flood defences where houses are not at risk. In addition, there is growing scientific evidence that the area would be more ecologically rich if allowed to return to its natural state. The partnership and the Environment Agency have proposed estuary restoration, and have been talking to residents, businesses, and visitors about how to proceed in the future. Presently, a shingle beach and raised river banks prevent seawater from penetrating the uppermost areas of the Cuckmere Valley. But the Environment Agency projects that an expected sea level rise due to climate change will increase the already steep costs of physical reinforcement, and current measures will not be sufficient. They intend to stop repair of the levees and to allow the cycle of natural processes, including periodic flooding of the area. The planning collaborators believe that in the long term, restoration of the saltwater estuary and marshes will enrich the ecological habitat, attract more wildlife and improve tourism.

The Environment Agency plans have provoked controversy in the valley, especially among some property owners. Some residents have formed a group called &quot;Rescue the Cuckmere Valley&quot; to try to create an alternative to proposed seasonal flooding. In early 2008 the Cuckmere Parish Council issued a public statement urging the Environment Agency to take less drastic steps in the near term, protecting the Cut while developing longer-term plans over the next 25–50 years.

<doc id="1121269" wikidata="Q740693" url="?curid=1121269" title="Beaujeu, Rhône">
<text>Beaujeu () is a commune of the Rhône department in eastern France. It lies southwest of Mâcon and northwest of Lyon, on the river Ardière.

Beaujeu gives its name to the famous wine region Beaujolais and the former province Beaujolais (&quot;Biôjolês&quot;), of which it is the historical capital. However it was overtaken in the 14th century by Villefranche-sur-Saône, which remains the main commercial centre of the region.

==History==
Beaujolais was a semi-autonomous fiefdom of the Lords of Beaujeu. The barony was acquired in the 9th century by Guillaume, Comte du Lyonnais and Count of Forez; on his death, his son Bérard became the first Lord of Beaujeu.

===List of rulers===
Lords:
* Berard of Beaujeu + c. 966
* Guichard I of Beaujeu c. 966-977
* Humbert I of Beaujeu + c. 977-1016
* Guichard II of Beaujeu c. 1016-1050
* Guichard III of Beaujeu c. 1050-1070
* Humbert II of Beaujeu c. 1070-1102
* Guichard IV of Beaujeu 1102-1137
* Humbert III of Beaujeu 1137-1174
* Humbert IV of Beaujeu 1174-1202
* Guichard V le Grand of Beaujeu 1202-1216
* Humbert V of Beaujeu 1216-1250
* Isabelle de Beaujeu 1250-1297 (married Renaud)
* Renaud I of Forez, count of Forez 1250-1297
* Louis de Beaujeu 1250-1295
* Guichard VI of Beaujeu 1295-1331
* Edouard I of Beaujeu 1331-1351 (Marshal of France)
* Antoine of Beaujeu 1351-1374
* Edouard II of Beaujeu 1374-1400 (+1400 without succession)

After the death of Edouard II, the barony passed to his uncle Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and was used as a title first by members of the Bourbon family and then by the House of Orléans. In 1522, Francis I of France confiscated the title and gave it to his mother Louise of Savoy, but it reverted to the French crown on her death in 1531.

David Gilbert (born October 6, 1944) is an American radical leftist who participated in the deadly 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored vehicle. Gilbert was a founder of the Columbia University chapter of Students for a Democratic Society and became a member of the Weather Underground. Gilbert, who served as the getaway driver in the robbery, was convicted under New York&#x27;s felony murder law in the killing by co-defendants of two Nyack, New York police officers and a Brink&#x27;s security guard.

Gilbert received a grant of clemency from Governor Andrew Cuomo on August 23, 2021, reducing his minimum term from 75 years to 40, thereby making him eligible for conditional release. He was granted parole on October 26, 2021, and released on November 4, 2021.

==Early life and education==
Gilbert grew up in a Jewish family in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He was an Explorer Scout, and his father was Post Leader, of a South Brookline Explorer Post. Inspired in his teens by the Greensboro sit-ins and other events of the Civil Rights Movement, he joined the Congress of Racial Equality at age seventeen. He entered Columbia College of Columbia University in 1962. In March 1965, Gilbert founded the Independent Committee on Vietnam (ICV) at Columbia. Later, in the same year, he co-founded the Columbia chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) which merged with ICV in the Fall of 1966, even though there was already an SDS chapter established at Columbia, formed in the early 1960s. The SDS chapter founded by Gilbert became renowned.

He traveled regularly to Harlem while working as a tutor, and saw Malcolm X speak at Barnard College in February 1965, experiences he describes as formative. Gilbert was one of the attendees at the Flint War Council known to the FBI.

==Career==
After graduating from Columbia University in June 1966, Gilbert spent most of his days and evenings during the fall of 1967 downtown, attending graduate school at the New School for Social Research, building an SDS chapter there, or attending meetings at the New York SDS Regional Office. In addition, Gilbert spent his spare time studying Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; and writing New Left theoretical papers on imperialism and U.S. domestic consumption, consumerism and &quot;the new working-class&quot;. At Columbia, the SDS expanded during the Spring 1967 term. Gilbert returned to the Columbia campus to offer a &quot;radical education counter-course&quot; for Columbia SDS freshmen and sophomores in a lounge in Ferris Booth Hall.

Known by the late 1960s primarily as a young theorist, publishing articles in &quot;New Left Notes&quot; and other movement publications, he went on to play an organizing role in the April–May 1968 Columbia student strike. On April 4, 1968, Gilbert was arrested for the first time, after joining a disturbance where 6 officers were engaged in a physical altercation with a protester. Gilbert&#x27;s charge was assaulting a police officer. Gilbert maintained that the officer scraped his hand when he tried to hit Gilbert in the head with his baton. His lawyer advised him to take a plea bargain, and Gilbert pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $50.

During the Columbia strike, which began on April 23, 1968, Gilbert served as part of the strike team. Having good relations with some of the faculty, he was called on to be a negotiator. At the time of the strike he was still a graduate student at the New School for Social Research. In October 1969, he headed a Weather Underground collective in Denver and was arrested twice. The first arrest occurred while he was passing out leaflets in front of a community college and his comrades were inside setting off a smoke bomb. The second arrest led to a charge of &quot;assault with a deadly weapon&quot; after arresting officers found a rock in his pocket.

===Weather Underground===
In 1969, SDS split into different ideological factions and the Weathermen emerged, its purpose being to promote armed struggle among young white Americans in support of the Black Panthers and other militant groups, and also to oppose the war in Vietnam by means of activities intended to &quot;Bring the War Home&quot;. Gilbert joined this group in 1969 with his friend Ted Gold, who died in the March 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, along with fellow Weather members Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins. The group became clandestine, and the organization was renamed the Weather Underground. When Weather went underground, members often used money they already had or which they received from their family to fund their efforts. Gilbert cashed in his Israel bonds and half of that money went to supporting Weather and the other half was put into the Black Panther bail fund.

Gilbert joined the Bay Area collective, living in a San Francisco apartment. He and another member were working on one of the group&#x27;s cars in spring of 1971 when they were approached by two men in suits claiming to be real-estate agents. The men asked a few questions and then left. Gilbert suspected that these men were actually FBI agents looking for information. After several group meetings, they decided to reduce their radical activities for a while.

As support for the group began to wane, the pace of their activities slowed, and some members of the Weather Underground resurfaced in late 1976 and early 1977. Gilbert resurfaced briefly in Denver, Colorado, between 1977 and 1979. He had helped organize a Weather collective there in October 1969. Before surfacing, he managed to get his criminal charges dropped, so he did not face any potential legal penalties. Gilbert, however, did not believe it was in the best interests of the movement for him to resurface. Most Weather members were not prosecuted and did not serve time in prison, despite having been sought by the police for years; police misconduct led to the dropping of many charges (see: COINTELPRO). Still, Gilbert opted to continue his life underground. Gilbert and his then-partner, Kathy Boudin, remained active in the Weather Underground, even following the birth of their son, Chesa Boudin, in August 1980.

====Brink&#x27;s robbery====

In the late 1970s or early 1980s Gilbert and other white activists joined the RATF (Revolutionary Armed Task Force), an alliance of white revolutionaries with, and under the leadership of, the RATF unit of the Black Liberation Army (BLA). On October 20, 1981, the RATF and related May 19th Communist Organization participated, along with several members of the BLA, in an armed robbery of a Brink&#x27;s armored car at the Nanuet Mall, near Nyack, New York.

While Gilbert and Boudin acted as the getaway vehicle driver and lookout in a waiting U-Haul truck in a nearby parking lot, armed BLA members took another vehicle to the mall, where a Brink&#x27;s truck was making a delivery. They confronted the guards, and a shootout ensued, wounding guard Joe Trombino after he fired one shot, and killing his co-worker, Peter Paige. The robbers then took $1.6 million in cash and raced to transfer this into the waiting U-Haul. The truck was soon stopped by a police roadblock.

Two police officers, Waverly L. Brown and Edward J. O&#x27;Grady, were killed in the shootout. Gilbert fled the area with other RATF and BLA members but was caught by police that day. He was convicted and sentenced in 1983 to 75 years for three counts of felony murder.

===Imprisonment===
While confined at the maximum security Auburn Correctional Facility in Cayuga County, New York during the early years of his sentence, Gilbert in 1987 co-founded an inmate peer education program on HIV and AIDS, and a similar, more successful project in Great Meadows Prison in Comstock following his transfer to the eastern part of the state.

Gilbert served his sentence in various New York prisons, being last incarcerated at the Shawangunk Correctional Facility, just outside Wallkill, New York.

===Commutation of sentence===
On August 23, 2021, his last day in office, Governor Andrew Cuomo granted Gilbert clemency in the form of a partial sentence commutation. The commutation of Gilbert&#x27;s minimum sentence from 75 years to the 40 years he served by October 2021 did not constitute a pardon or reduce the sentence to time served but did make Gilbert eligible to appear before the state&#x27;s parole board. The board announced on October 26, 2021, that it had granted Gilbert parole, effective in November 2021. Gilbert was released on November 4, 2021.

==Writings==
David Gilbert co-wrote the pamphlet &quot;U.S. Imperialism&quot; with David Loud. The pamphlet was used across the country as a study guide by SDSers. Gilbert co-wrote an article entitled &quot;Praxis and the New Left&quot;. It appeared in the first issue of &quot;Praxis&quot; on February 13, 1967. The article, co-written with Bob Gottlieb and Gerry Tenney, was part of a longer position paper called the &quot;Port Authority Statement&quot;.

There is a mini-biography on David Gilbert on page 312 of the book &quot;Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity&quot;, by Dan Berger.

In an article published in the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; on April 2, 1983, Bob Feldman wrote: &quot;Beyond Brinks: David Gilbert Talks About the Robbery, the Underground, the Struggle&quot;.

Gilbert was one of a small group that edited and rewrote Bill Ayers&#x27; initial draft of &quot;Prairie Fire&quot;. Explaining the book&#x27;s purpose, Gilbert said, &quot;We needed something to re-mobilize us, we needed to have an organization to fight imperialism.&quot;

Gilbert&#x27;s political memoir, &quot;Love And Struggle: My Life in SDS, the Weather Underground and Beyond&quot; was published in 2012 by PM Press.

==Personal life==
Gilbert had a son with fellow Weather Underground member Kathy Boudin, in New York City in 1980. After Gilbert and Boudin were arrested for the Brink&#x27;s robbery, their 14-month-old son, Chesa Boudin, was raised in Chicago by adoptive parents Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who, like his parents, had been members of the Weather Underground. Chesa Boudin grew up to be a Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law School graduate, and, from 2019 to 2022, District Attorney of San Francisco.

<text>Steve Dorner is an American software engineer who developed the Eudora e-mail client in 1988 as a part of his work as a staff member at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dorner was hired by Qualcomm in July 1992 and Eudora was subsequently acquired by Qualcomm. Dorner also developed a popular online directory/phone book in the early 1990s commonly referred to as the CCSO Nameserver.

Dorner received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1983 from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

A 1997 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes how Dorner, when he stopped working for the University and started working for Qualcomm, chose not to move to California. Instead, he was a remote worker from an office in a 1950s bomb shelter under his home in Urbana, Illinois. Later, he moved his office to his woodworking shop, which is heated.

As of 2006, Dorner was one of Qualcomm engineers tasked with shifting Eudora to a Mozilla Thunderbird base.

==Cancer diagnosis==

In November 2010, Dorner was diagnosed with cancer, which manifested itself first as testicular cancer. As of January 2011, his personal blog reported that treatment was continuing. In July 2011, Dorner reported that his cancer might have been eradicated.

<text>Ante Razov (born March 2, 1974) is an American soccer coach and former player who is an assistant coach for Los Angeles FC. A prolific forward, Razov is one of the leading goal scorers in the history of Major League Soccer (MLS) and the all-time leading goal scorer for two current or former MLS clubs: the Chicago Fire with 76 goals and Chivas USA with 30 goals. In April 2007, Razov became the third player in MLS history to score 100 goals. Razov also played for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team.

==Early life==
Razov, who was born in a family of Croatian immigrants, spent his childhood in Fontana, California. He attended Fontana High School, and went on to play college soccer at UCLA.

==Playing career==

===Club===
Razov was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the third round of the 1996 MLS College Draft. He played two seasons in LA, but did not get much playing time, scoring just one goal, and signed with the expansion Chicago Fire prior to the 1998 season. During his time with the Galaxy, he went on loan with the Sacramento Scorpions of USISL.

Razov spent the next seven years with Chicago, save a brief period in 2001 that he spent with Spanish second division club Racing de Ferrol. In his seven years with the Fire he led the club in goals and points five times (including club record 18 goals and 42 points in 2000). He is the club&#x27;s all-time leader with 76 goals and 190 points. Razov was named to the MLS Best XI in 2003. With Chicago, he won the MLS Cup in 1998 and the US Open Cup in 1998, 2000, and 2003. Following a disappointing 2004 season and clashes with head coach Dave Sarachan, Razov was traded to the Columbus Crew in exchange for Tony Sanneh. However, one blemish in Razov&#x27;s career was being stopped from the penalty spot in the 2003 MLS Cup. The Fire went on to lose the game, 4–2.

But Razov did not last long in Columbus. Even though he scored in the 2005 season opener, his tenure with the club lasted five games. Disagreement with head coach Greg Andrulis led to Razov&#x27;s reuniting with his ex-coach with the Fire, Bob Bradley, at the MetroStars. He was acquired in exchange for John Wolyniec and a partial allocation. After the season, Bradley acquired Razov again, for Thiago Martins and another partial allocation.

On April 21, 2007, Razov scored his 100th career regular-season MLS goal. At 33 years old, he became the third player in MLS history to reach 100 goals. At the time, he trailed only Jaime Moreno and Jeff Cunningham, having passed Jason Kreis. All three joined MLS at its inception in 1996.

===International===
Razov received his first cap with the U.S. national team on March 25, 1995, against Uruguay. Although he never played in the World Cup, he scored a couple of key goals in qualifiers, including one against Guatemala in 2000 and Trinidad and Tobago in 2001. Overall, Razov scored six goals in 25 caps for the US.

<text>AST Research, Inc., later doing business as AST Computer, was an American personal computer manufacturer. It was founded in 1980 in Irvine, California, by Albert Wong, Safi Qureshey, and Thomas Yuen, as an initialism of their first names. Wong left the company nine years later, followed by Yuen in 1992, with Qureshey remaining until AST was acquired by Samsung Electronics in 1997.

The company began by making a circuit board for the IBM PC that boosted its memory storage. AST went public in 1984 and would be a manufacturer of boards and add-on expansion cards. By the late 1980s, it had evolved into a major personal computer manufacturer with its line of Intel i386 based PC clones, and it was the first vendor to announce an i486 PC. In 1990, AST released an NEC PC-9801 clone in the Japanese market, becoming the first American PC vendor to market an NEC clone.

AST had established itself as one of the known &quot;alternative&quot; brands of PCs in the United States while globally it had numerous plants and was one of the world&#x27;s largest makers of personal computers. However, increasing competition and its difficulty to integrate the assets of Tandy Corporation acquired in 1993, led to it making major losses in the following years. Samsung Electronics purchased a stake in AST in 1995 and bought the company outright two years later, leading to co-founder Qureshey stepping down as CEO and chairman. Unable to recover and causing additional losses to Samsung, AST was &quot;de facto&quot; closed down in 1999 and its brand name and patents sold to a consortium led by Beny Alagem.

==Foundation (1979–1986)==
AST Research was founded as AST Associates by Thomas C. K. Yuen, Albert C. Wong, and Safi U. Qureshey. All three were immigrants to the United States—Yuen and Wong from Hong Kong and Qureshey from Pakistan. Yuen had met Qureshey while working for Computer Automation Inc. in the 1970s, while Wong was a roommate of Yuen&#x27;s while they both attended Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California. All had come to the United States to study engineering. Yuen was the principal founder of AST, proposing the creation of the company in 1979. Before breaking into the manufacture of hardware, Yuen envisioned the company as a computer consultancy firm for large businesses. The three incorporated AST Research with $2,000 of start-up capital in Irvine, California, in July 1980. The company name is an initialism for the three founders&#x27; first names. Selecting their initial job titles by drawing straws, Qureshey was named president, Yuen was named treasurer, and Wong was named secretary.

AST delivered its first products by the end of 1981. By then, the computer consultancy idea had been abandoned, the company was renamed to AST Research, and the trio were deep into researching and developing expansion cards for the original IBM Personal Computer, which had been released in August 1981. The founders deemed the initial models of the IBM PC to have been equipped with an inadequate amount of RAM and communications capability and so devised a range of expansion cards that provided these features. They are listed in the charter issue of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; as follows: a series of memory expansion cards, ranging from 64 KB to 256 KB of additional RAM (with parity); a modem card with a phone jack and an RS-232 serial port; two asynchronous serial communication cards, one with a single RS-232 port and the other dual ports; and an advanced serial communication card, featuring two independently programmable RS-232 ports that could be programmed to support asynchronous, bisynchronous, SDLC, and HDLC protocols.

Sales of this initial lineup of products doubled every month within the first year of availability. Needing to keep up with the increasing demand from the customer base, the company vied for venture capital but were turned down by multiple banks. Instead, the founders all took out second mortgages on their residences in 1982 and were able to pool an additional $50,000 to invest into the company. Fortunately for the founders, AST&#x27;s sales reached $13 million in 1983. This sudden increase in sales finally attracted venture capitalists, who invested $2.4 million in the company. In 1984, the company filed its initial public offering, bearing two million shares to the public in June that year.

In late 1983, the company introduced the SixPakPlus, a popular multifunction expansion card for the IBM PC that led to another sharp increase in sales. Shortly afterwards AST signed an agreement offered by IBM, allowing the latter company to resell AST&#x27;s expansion cards at its IBM Product Centers and other reseller channels. Spurred by these developments, in March 1985 AST&#x27;s executives opened AST Far East, Ltd., in Hong Kong. This was its first international subsidiary, serving as a crucial additional production line for the manufacture of the company&#x27;s increasingly diverse products. AST&#x27;s lineup of products by this point counted graphics cards for multiple computing platforms, a hard disk drive unit for the original compact Macintoshes, a multi-function serial/parallel/clock expansion board for the Apple II and a local area network board for the IBM PC.

From 1984 to 1985, AST&#x27;s income rose from $5.7 million to $19 million, and from 1985 to 1986, AST&#x27;s revenues doubled, reaching $138.6 million, In March 1986, the company purchased the French computer wholesaler National System Company, in order to establish a second international subsidiary, AST France. Shortly after, AST company acquired Camintonn, a computer memory maker. By the end of 1986, AST had established overseas divisions in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The combined revenue from international subsidiaries contributed to one quarter of the company&#x27;s revenue. With this success, AST reincorporated in Delaware to take advantage of its corporate laws.

==PC compatibles and Apple expansion (1986–1989)==
By late 1986, AST&#x27;s expansion card offerings were facing imminent obsolescence, as IBM by this point had offered higher-end upgraded models of the IBM PC, chiefly the PC XT and the PC/AT, that integrated most of the features of AST&#x27;s PC expansion cards. To keep from posting losses, AST laid off seven percent of the company&#x27;s 890 employees in July 1986; clandestinely, they also laid plans to introduce a line of PC-compatible computer systems. The AST Premium/286, a clone of the PC/AT featuring an identical Intel 80286 microprocessor, was introduced in October 1986. To make the computer more competitive among a crowded PC compatible market, AST offered the Premium/286 in an optional package that included a discounted laser printer and image scanner, advertised as an inexpensive desktop publishing workstation. AST released an upgraded version of the Premium/286 with the 32-bit Intel 80386 processor—the Premium/386—in October 1987.

AST&#x27;s products for Apple hardware were profitable enough in the interim. In 1986, AST even expanded its Apple support by introducing peripherals for the then-newly released Apple IIGS, with a pair of expansion cards: the SprintDisk 1 MB RAM Disk card and the AST Vision Plus, a real-time video digitizer card. The Vision Plus was eventually sold to Silicon &amp; Software and licensed to Virtual Realities (and sold through LRO and later Alltech Electronics). In 1987 it went on to produce a memory expansion card for the Apple IIGS: the RamStakPlus, a dual RAM/ROM memory expansion card. AST Research also produced for the Macintosh line the Mac286, a pair of NuBus cards containing an Intel 80286 and RAM, allowing a Macintosh to run MS-DOS side by side with its existing operating system.

The Premium/286 accounted for half of the company&#x27;s sales by July 1987, but by the end of the year it was only a meager success for AST at first. In 1987, the company reported a net income of $13 million, less than half the profit they had posted the preceding year. AST had several setbacks in 1987, including flat sales of expansion products and delayed shipments of a peripheral for IBM PCs in June 1987 that was a factor in a canceled stock call the following month. That year, IBM sued AST over alleged trademark infringement of IBM&#x27;s PS/2 product name occurring in one of AST&#x27;s print advertisements for RAM, which was settled out of court. In 1988, AST&#x27;s executives began a reorganization effort to preserve the company. The first initiative was the merging of AST&#x27;s data communications group into its systems products division. With the nascent OS/2 operating system coming to market that year, co-developed by IBM and Microsoft, AST licensed the rights from Microsoft to market its own OEM versions of OS/2 as an option for its Premium line of computers.

In late 1988, AST joined eight other major PC compatible manufacturers to develop the Extended Industry Standard Architecture as a viable competitor to IBM&#x27;s closely guarded Micro Channel bus architecture. This consortium was known as the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot;, although in truth Compaq was the lead writer of the EISA specification.

From July to November 1988, AST introduced seven models of premium computers, and in early September 1988, they announced a $2.2 million television advertising campaign, the first commercials of which premiering during the 1988 Summer Olympics that month. The television commercials comprised roughly 20 percent of AST&#x27;s $12 million advertising budget and were supported by a line of memorabilia, including pins, posters, and video tapes, tying in with the Olympics and offered at computer dealer shows. By the end of 1988, AST&#x27;s restructuring and advertising efforts were successful, with year-to-year sales increasing 100 percent to $412.7 million. AST was now third place in sales among manufacturers of PC compatibles, behind IBM and Compaq.

In late 1988, Wong was ousted from AST after a heated boardroom debate with Yuen, in which Wong had complained about the company&#x27;s recent turbulence. In January 1989, the company laid off 120 employees, or six percent of the workforce. In early 1989, AST reported its first quarterly loss, totaling $8.9 million. The technology press speculated that the loss was due to AST ignoring Intel&#x27;s development of the i486 while the company was busy restructuring and boosting its advertising. When Intel released the i486 to the public in early 1989, AST was one of the few PC compatible manufacturers which had not announced a i486 computer in the pipeline contemporaneously. Slowing sales led to crowded warehouses of AST products, leading to strain for AST in the form of storage costs. To recoup its losses, in April 1989, the company spun off Camintonn, relinquishing control to the division&#x27;s managers, and in mid-1989, the company sold its Apple-related products to Orange Micro. In 1989, they were ranked as the ninth largest personal computer manufacturer in the United States with a 2% market share, despite being a relatively late entry in the market.

==Turnaround (1989–1994)==
In 1989, AST introduced Cupid, the trademark for a method of making computer systems forward-compatible with upgraded microprocessors and memory chips. This works by having the motherboard be a passive backplane, with no processor and memory which are instead located on a Cupid expansion card, to be plugged into the backplane and replaced as upgrades became available. Although the expectation for all AST customers to upgrade their purchases this way was unrealistic, Cupid technology enabled a successful marketing scheme, by eliminating customer hesitation over immediate obsolescence. Such concerns were prevalent due to the rapid increases in computing power in the early 1990s. Using Cupid, AST marketed systems based on the latest and fastest clock-speed revisions of Intel&#x27;s processors almost immediately—simply by replacing one card in the system—making it possible for AST to price its computers between ten and sixty percent cheaper than competitors.

In April 1990, the company announced the Dual SX/16, a clone of NEC&#x27;s PC-9801 computer, to be sold exclusively in Japan where the PC-9800 series had flourished. This venture into Japan posed a risk for AST, as the company lacked a large dealer network in the country, but the company&#x27;s executives, especially Qureshey, were persuaded by the vastness of Japan&#x27;s business computer market during this time—second only to the United States in size. As it had done in the United States, AST offered the Dual SX/16 with more features and lower prices than domestic competitors. Unlike in the United States, AST developed bespoke brand names for its Japanese computers, in an attempt to fit in the market; the company was also negotiating with Sharp Corporation to market variants of the Dual SX/16 under the Sharp brand. Likewise, AST began marketing computers in former Soviet bloc countries and in India. This push toward foreign markets was another attempt by AST to recover from lost market share in the United States in the early 1990s.

These developments and more led to a quick financial recovery for AST, and in 1990 the company&#x27;s stock price had risen roughly 260 percent in concert with its sales and earnings growth. Firmly entrenched as the third-largest PC manufacturer, sales reached nearly $1 billion by the end of 1990. AST was sourced as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) by other computer companies such as Unisys, Tandem Computers, Digital Equipment Corporation, Texas Instruments.

AST were also highly successful in the People&#x27;s Republic of China where it dominated the PC market in the early 1990s.

Success continued in 1991. Industry leader Compaq and several other competitors announced steep price cuts in direct response to AST early in the year. A few months later, when Intel released the low-cost 80486SX desktop processor, AST announced a i486SX-based computer system the next day. That year, AST beat Compaq for a contract to supply over 1,600 laptops to AT&amp;T&#x27;s sales department during a time when AT&amp;T was selling its own laptops and other computer systems. By early 1991, 65 percent of the computer systems supplied to &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies had AST as OEM.

As with many other computer companies, AST struggled in 1992 due to a fierce price war started by Compaq. During plans to restructure AST yet again to minimize operating costs, Yuen left the company early that year, leaving Qureshey as the sole remaining co-founder. Qureshey and his executive board set out to maintain AST&#x27;s third-place status and keep on top of developments in the computer industry. In November 1992, the company introduced the PowerExec 4/25SL Color Plus, one of the first laptops with the portable-specific 80486SL processor. It was released shortly after Compaq released the LTE Lite 4/25C, which is the first laptop with an i486SL. In 1993, AST announced a joint venture with Grid Systems, a subsidiary of Tandy Corporation, to develop a pen-tablet computer called the PenExec, which has a cordless stylus.

In mid-1993, AST acquired both Grid Systems and Tandy&#x27;s computer division for $105 million. The company incurred a loss with this purchase but gained four PC manufacturing plants—one in Scotland, the rest in Texas—and a litany of patents and software copyrights that had been registered to Tandy Corporation. The Scotland plant was later shut down, to afford building another factory in Ireland, and by 1995 only one of the Texas plants remained operational. In January 1994, AST announced its agreement to sell PenRight and FieldNet—pen-based software development tools included in AST&#x27;s previous acquisition of Grid and Tandy—to the Telxon Corporation. The deal was finalized in April that year.

==Decline and sale (1994–2001)==

By the mid-1990s, AST had severe problems in the highly competitive PC market. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, AST&#x27;s prospect shrunk due to the strategy of offering premium models in an increasingly competitive personal computer market, while Compaq and other top manufacturers slashed prices in direct competition with the cheapest clones. Revenues for 1996 were $2.1 billion, down from 1995 revenues of over $2.3 billion. In 1997, AST Research was wholly acquired by Samsung. At the time, Samsung owned 46 percent of AST and had offered to buy the remaining common shares. Prior to this move, Samsung had already owned a substantial stake and provided considerable financial support to keep AST going. By December, the number of employees was down to 1,900. In 1999, Samsung was forced to close the California-based computer maker after a string of losses and a mass defection of research talent. Samsung had invested US$1 billion in the company.

The AST trademark was sold to Beny Alagem, co-founder of Packard Bell, on January 10, 1999; Alagem also gained an exclusive license to the company&#x27;s intellectual property. The deal was estimated at around $200 million in value according to one person familiar with its details. Alagem additionally invested $12.5 million into the formation of AST Computers, a separate, &quot;Internet-driven&quot; joint venture based in Los Angeles, with Alagem holding a 65 percent stake and Samsung holding a 35 percent stake; however, the venture failed to gain traction as the computer market slowed in late 2000, becoming moribund by 2004. Meanwhile, Samsung restructured the original AST as ARI Service to support its existing products until it was dissolved on February 28, 2001.

<text>Prince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe (; 20 February 1898 – 13 July 1974) was a German prince and head of the Náchod branch of the princely house of Schaumburg-Lippe.

== Early life ==

He was born on 20 February 1898 in Sopron, Hungary as the only son and second child of Frederick of Schaumburg-Lippe (1868–1945) and his first wife Princess Louise of Denmark, younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark.

== Marriage and issue ==
In 1927, his engagement to Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, a daughter of Constantine I of Greece was announced. However, nothing went as planned. She later married Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta.

He was also briefly considered as a marriage candidate for Princess Juliana, the heiress to the Dutch throne. They had met each other in 1932 in Mecklenburg, home of Juliana’s paternal relations. Although his reputation as a womanizer, his previous called off engagement and his German heritage did not make him a popular choice, he was reconsidered after other candidates were rejected by the Queen or Juliana herself.
These plans, however, did not prove fruitful either.

On 9 September 1937, he married his cousin, Princess Feodora, daughter of his maternal uncle Prince Harald of Denmark who was a younger brother of King Christian X and Princess Louise, at Fredensborg Palace, Zealand, Denmark; they had four children.

* Prince Wilhelm of Schaumburg-Lippe (b. 19 August 1939)
* Prince Waldemar of Schaumburg-Lippe (19 December 1940 – 11 August 2020)
* Princess Marie of Schaumburg-Lippe (b. 27 December 1945)
* Prince Harald of Schaumburg-Lippe (b. 27 March 1948)

== Later life ==
Together with his wife, he took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

He died aged 76 on 13 July 1974 at Bückeburg, a year before his wife. His four children live in Germany and Denmark.

<text>USS &quot;Rizal&quot; (DD–174) was a in the United States Navy following World War I. She was named for José Rizal, a Filipino patriot, and the national hero of the Philippines.

==History==
To support its efforts in World War I, &quot;Rizal&quot; was donated to the United States by the Philippine Legislature of the American-colonial Insular Government of the Philippines. The destroyer was laid down on 26 June 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California and launched on 21 September 1918, sponsored by Sofia de Veyra, both before the end of World War I. However, the vessel was commissioned on 28 May 1919, with Commander Edmund Root at the helm, after the end of the war the previous November.

Joining the Pacific Fleet upon commissioning, &quot;Rizal&quot; cruised along the United States west coast into 1920 on exercises and training duty. Subsequently modified for service as a light minelayer, she was classified DM-14 on 17 July 1920. &quot;Rizal&quot; departed San Diego on 25 March 1920 for the Far East. Calling at Honolulu, Midway, and Guam, &quot;Rizal&quot; arrived in Cavite on 1 May 1920 to assume the duties of flagship of the Mine Detachment Division of the Asiatic Fleet. With Filipinos constituting the majority of her crew, &quot;Rizal&quot; remained on the Asiatic Station for ten years. She spent long months anchored in Chinese ports during the spring, summer, and autumn months. Her most frequent ports of call were Shanghai, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, and Hong Kong. &quot;Rizal&quot; cruised eastward to Apra Harbor, Guam, during November 1928, and visited Yokohama, Japan, from 11 to 20 April 1929.

&quot;Rizal&quot; spent each winter generally from November through March, anchored in Manila Bay. She was docked annually at Olongapo and upon resuming active service each spring operated in Philippine waters. Ordered home late in 1930, &quot;Rizal&quot; departed Manila on 11 December 1930 for Guam, Honolulu, and San Diego. She decommissioned on 20 August 1931 at San Diego and was towed northward to Mare Island on 31 August 1931 by the minesweeper to be placed in reserve. Struck from the Navy list on 11 November 1931, &quot;Rizal&quot; was dismantled and her materials were sold 25 February 1932 for scrapping in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty for the reduction and limitation of naval armament.

No other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<text>The Standard Fruit Company (now Dole plc) was established in the United States in 1924 by the Vaccaro brothers. Its forerunner was started in 1899, when Sicilian Arberesh immigrants Joseph, Luca and Felix Vaccaro, together with Salvador D&#x27;Antoni, began importing bananas to New Orleans from La Ceiba, Honduras. By 1915, the business had grown so large that it bought most of the ice factories in New Orleans in order to refrigerate its banana ships, leading to its president, Joseph Vaccaro, becoming known as the &quot;Ice King&quot;.

Along with the United Fruit Company, Standard Fruit played a significant role in the governments of Honduras and other Central American countries, which became known as &quot;banana republics&quot; due to the high degree of control which the fruit companies held over the nations.

In 1926, the company changed its name from Standard Fruit Company to Standard Fruit &amp; Steamship Company. Between 1964 and 1968, the company was acquired by the Castle &amp; Cooke Corporation, which also acquired James Dole&#x27;s Hawaiian Pineapple Company (HAPCO) around the same time. In 1991, Castle &amp; Cooke was renamed Dole Food Company. Castle &amp; Cooke Inc, a real estate company, was spun off in 1995 and, following a 2000 management buyout, is now privately held.

==1954 Honduras strike==
In 1954, there was a general strike in Honduras against the Standard Fruit company among others. A detailed timeline can be seen below:

<text>Sir William Robertson Nicoll (10 October 18514 May 1923) was a Scottish Free Church minister, journalist, editor, and man of letters.

==Biography==
Nicoll was born in Lumsden, Aberdeenshire, the son of Rev. Harry Nicoll (1812–1891), a Free Church minister of Auchindoir, and his wife, Jane Robertson.

He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and graduated MA at the University of Aberdeen in 1870, and studied for the ministry at the Free Church Divinity Hall there until 1874, when he was ordained minister of the Free Church at Dufftown, Banffshire. Three years later he moved to Kelso where he met Jane T. Stoddart. He was to be a great influence on her life. In 1884 became he editor of &quot;The Expositor&quot; for Hodder and Stoughton, a position which he held until his death.

In 1885, Nicoll was forced to retire from pastoral ministry after an attack of typhoid had badly damaged his lung. In 1886, he moved south to London. With the support of Hodder and Stoughton he founded the &quot;British Weekly&quot;, a Nonconformist newspaper, which gained great influence over opinion in the &quot;free churches&quot; (i.e. those Christian denominations outside the established church). He had been working with Jane Stoddart on a project and in 1890 she left teaching to join him on a full time basis as his assistant.

Nicoll secured many writers of exceptional talent for his paper (including Marcus Dods, J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Alexander Whyte, Alexander Maclaren, Carnegie Simpson and James Denney), to which he added his own considerable talents as a contributor. He began a highly popular feature, &quot;Correspondence of Claudius Clear&quot;, which enabled him to share his interests and his reading with his readers. He was also the founding editor of &quot;The Bookman&quot; from 1891, and acted as chief literary adviser to Hodder and Stoughton.

Among his other enterprises were &quot;The Expositor&#x27;s Bible&quot; (originally published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1887–1896, but afterward reprinted in New York by A. C. Armstrong &amp; Son) and &quot;The Theological Educator&quot;. He edited &quot;The Expositor&#x27;s Greek Testament&quot; (from 1897). He also edited a series of &quot;Contemporary Writers&quot; (from 1894), and of &quot;Literary Lives&quot; (from 1904).

He projected, but never wrote, a history of &quot;The Victorian Era in English Literature&quot;, and edited, with T. J. Wise, two volumes of &quot;Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century&quot;. He was knighted by King Edward VII in 1909, ostensibly for his literary work, but in reality probably more for his long-term support for the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1921 Birthday Honours.
Nicoll was the father of Maurice Nicoll, a leading British psychologist and author who studied under Carl Jung and became a leading expositor of the teachings of the Greco-Armenian spiritual master G.I. Gurdjieff.

He died on 4 May 1923 at his home, Bay Tree House, in Frognal, Hampstead, London and is buried in a family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.
==Family==

He married twice: firstly in 1878 to Isabella Dunlop (1857–1894); secondly in 1897 to Catherine Pollard (1863–1960).

Children from the first marriage were Isa Constance Nicoll (1881–1963) an author and poet, and Henry Maurice Dunlop Nicoll (1884–1953) a noted psychiatrist.

The one child of the second marriage was Mildred Robertson Nicoll (1898–1995).

<text>Xara Designer Pro+ is an image editing program incorporating photo editing and vector illustration tools created by British software company Xara. Xara Xtreme LX was an early open source version for Linux.

The Windows version was previously sold under the names Xara Studio, Xara X and Xara Xtreme, and traces its origin in the late 1980s to a title called ArtWorks for the Acorn Archimedes line of computers using RISC OS. There is a pro version called Xara Designer Pro (formerly Xara Xtreme Pro).

The current commercial version of Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer runs only on Windows, although Xara documents can be edited in a web browser on any platform using the Xara Cloud service. Versions up to 4.x can be run on Linux using Wine.

== History ==

ArtWorks, the predecessor of Xara Photo and Graphic Designer, was developed on Acorn Archimedes and Risc PC 32-bit RISC computers running RISC OS by Computer Concepts during the late 1980s. The first version, developed for Microsoft Windows was initially called Xara Studio. It was licensed to Corel Corporation before wide-scale public availability, and from 1995 to 2000 was released as CorelXARA. Corel ceded the licensing rights back to Xara in 2000. The first Xara X version released in 2000 by its original owner. The next version, Xara X¹, was released in 2004. Xara Xtreme was released in 2005.

In November 2006, Xara Xtreme PRO (an enhanced version of Xara Xtreme) was released. Xara Xtreme 3.2 and Xtreme Pro 3.2 were released in May 2007. 3.2 Pro included Xara3D, and both versions had more robust typography. In April 2008, Xara Xtreme 4.0 was released. Xara Xtreme and Xara Xtreme Pro 5.1 were released in June 2009. Features included more text-area enhancements, content-aware scaling of bitmap images, improved file import and export, master-page (repeated) objects, an object gallery (replacing the layer gallery), website-creation tools, and multi-stage graduated transparency. In June 2010, Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 6 and Xara Designer Pro 6 were released. Xtreme was renamed Photo &amp; Graphic Designer, and Xtreme Pro was renamed Designer Pro. In May 2011, Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 7 and Xara Designer Pro 7 were released. Features included &quot;magic&quot; photo erase, user interface improvements to docking galleries and snapping alignment, and (in Pro) new webpage and website-design features.

In May 2012, Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 2013 and Xara Designer Pro X (v8) were released. Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 9 was released in May 2013. In July of that year, Xara Designer Pro X9 was released. Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 10 was released on 16 July 2014, and Xara Designer Pro X10 on 23 July. Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer 11 was released on 29 June 2015, and Xara Designer Pro X11 was released the following month. In 2016, the delivery model was changed to an update service which can be renewed annually. Users are entitled to any updates released while the update service is active. The first update-service updates were in May 2016 for Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer, and July 2016 for Xara Designer Pro X.

== Features ==
Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer is known for its usability and fast renderer. It provides a fully anti-aliased display, advanced gradient fill, and transparency tools.

Among vector editors, Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer is considered to be fairly easy to learn, with similarities to CorelDRAW and Inkscape in terms of interface. Alongside the vector illustration tools, Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer also includes an integrated photo tool offering manual and automatic photo enhance, cropping, adjustment of brightness levels, red-eye fix, &#x27;magic&#x27; erase, photo healing, color and background erase, panoramas and content aware resizing. Designer Pro includes a wider range of tools for other design tasks including the creation of web pages and websites, and text and page layout tools for DTP with the aim of providing a single solution for all graphic and web design tasks.

<text>The Rupes Nigra (&quot;Black Rock&quot;), a phantom island, was believed to be a black rock located at the Magnetic North Pole or at the geographic North Pole itself. Described by Gerardus Mercator as 33 French miles in size, it provided a supposed explanation for why all compasses point to this location. The idea came from a lost work titled &quot;Inventio Fortunata&quot;, and the island featured on maps from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including those of Mercator and his successors. Mercator described the island in a 1577 letter to John Dee:

<doc id="1121314" wikidata="Q443392" url="?curid=1121314" title="Saint Bibiana">
<text>Saint Bibiana (Bibiane, Viviana, or Vivian) is a Roman Virgin martyr. The earliest mention in an authentic historical authority occurs in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, where the biography of Pope Simplicius (468–483) states that this pope &quot;consecrated a basilica of the holy martyr Bibiana, which contained her body, near the &#x27;palatium Licinianum&#x27;&quot; (ed. Duchesne, I, 249). The Basilica of Santa Bibiana is dedicated to her.

==Legend==
According to legend, Bibiana was the daughter of a former prefect, Flavianus, who was banished by Julian the Apostate. His wife Dafrosa, and two daughters, Demetria and Bibiana, were also persecuted by Julian. Dafrosa and Demetria died a natural death and were buried by Bibiana in their own house; but Bibiana was tortured and died as a result of her sufferings. Two days after her death a priest named John buried Bibiana near her mother and sister in her home, the house being later transformed into a church. It is evident that the legend seeks to explain in this way the origin of the church and the presence in it of the bodies of the above-mentioned confessors. The account contained in the martyrologies of the ninth century is drawn from the legend.
An alternate account says that in the year 363, Emperor Julian made Apronianus Governor of Rome. Bibiana suffered in the persecution started by him. She was the daughter of Christians, Flavian, a Roman knight, and Dafrosa, his wife. Flavian was tortured and sent into exile, where he died of his wounds. Dafrosa was beheaded, and their two daughters, Bibiana and Demetria, were stripped of their possessions and left to suffer poverty. However, they remained in their house, spending their time in fasting and prayer. Apronianus, seeing that hunger and want had no effect upon them, summoned them. Demetria, after confessing her faith, fell dead at the feet of the tyrant. Bibiana was reserved for greater sufferings. She was placed in the hands of a wicked woman called Rufina, who in vain endeavored to seduce her. She used blows as well as persuasion, but the Christian virgin remained faithful. Enraged at the constancy of this saintly virgin, Apronianus ordered her to be tied to a pillar and beaten with scourges, laden with lead plummets, until she died. The saint endured the torments with joy, and died under the blows inflicted by the hands of the executioner. Her body was then put in the open air to be torn apart by wild animals, yet none would touch it. After two days she was buried.

==Mistaken identity==
The above-mentioned Saint Bibiana (of the 4th century) should not be confused with Saint Vibiana (of the 3rd century), who is the patroness of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

<text>William Joseph Green III (born June 24, 1938) is an American politician from Pennsylvania. A Democrat, Green served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1964 to 1977 and as the 94th Mayor of Philadelphia from 1980 to 1984.

==Youth==
Green grew up in the Kensington neighborhood&#x27;s 33rd Ward with his brothers and sisters Mary, Anne, Michael, Dennis and Patrick. His father, William J. Green Jr., the dean of U.S. congressmen from Philadelphia at his death, was among the most powerful Democratic members of the U.S. House. This upbringing gave Green and his siblings extraordinary access to top Democratic Party leaders. The Harry Truman Presidential Library website, for instance, contains a picture of the Green family meeting with Harry Truman in the White House. And the records of the administration of President John F. Kennedy frequently mention the senior Green as well.

William J. Green III attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Prep School and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in 1960. He also graduated from Villanova Law School.

==Congressional career==

At the age of 25, Green was elected as a Democrat in a special election on April 28, 1964, to the Eighty-eighth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father. He was reelected to six successive Congresses and served until January 3, 1977.

Upon his election to Congress, Green and his wife Pat moved to Frankford. As a congressman in Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Great Society&quot; era, Green assumed leadership on issues such as meat inspection, rat control, and tax reform and led the charge in Congress to eliminate the oil depletion allowance. He voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and the Medicare Act of 1965, other pieces of President Johnson&#x27;s sweeping program of domestic reform, and was one of the original cosponsors of the Equal Rights Amendment. He had a 100 percent rating from the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, and the Americans for Democratic Action for his fourteen years in Congress.

Green served from December 1967, through December 1969, in his father&#x27;s old post as Democratic city chairman but resigned after the Democratic City Committee refused to adopt his reform plan following a Republican sweep led by District Attorney and future U.S. Senator Arlen Specter.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for mayor of Philadelphia in 1971, losing to former Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo&#x27;s &quot;law and order&quot; candidacy. In the 1972 congressional redistricting, Green&#x27;s opponents tried to gerrymander him out of his seat, placing him in the same district as Congressman James Byrne, in office since 1952. The newly merged district had voted heavily for Rizzo in the mayoral election and had been represented mainly by Byrne, for whom Rizzo campaigned actively. The grassroots organization Green put together for his mayoral campaign, however, enabled him to defeat Byrne decisively. He was then easily re-elected in the overwhelmingly Democratic year of 1974.

==Senate campaign==

In 1976, U.S. Senator Hugh Scott, the Senate Republican leader, announced his retirement after being tarred in a campaign finance scandal and facing pressure from fellow Republicans Arlen Specter and John Heinz, who each coveted his seat. Green did not seek re-election to the House, and instead sought Scott&#x27;s Senate seat.

Backed by Governor Milton Shapp, Green won the Democratic nomination for the seat, defeating State Senator Jeanette Reibman of Northampton County. Green&#x27;s fundraising skills, however, proved to be no match for the millions available to Heinz from his personal fortune after he defeated Arlen Specter in the Republican Senate primary. Heinz blasted Green for voting against defense budgets Green considered too expensive, implying that Green was weak on U.S. defense. Political cartoons of the time show Heinz pouring money from a giant ketchup bottle over Green&#x27;s head. Even so, and with Carter at the top of the Democratic ticket, Heinz barely reversed the Democratic tide and defeated Green, 52–48 percent.

After losing to Heinz, Green was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar, and he joined the now-defunct Philadelphia law firm Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, known for its lobbying and government relations practice. He moved out of his district to the Germantown section of Philadelphia and into the home of his mother-in-law, Margaret Sharpless Kirk, with his wife and children. They later moved to Chestnut Hill.

==As mayor==
He declined to run in the 1978 gubernatorial election but won the Democratic nomination for Mayor of Philadelphia in 1979, defeating runner-up Charles Bowser, former deputy mayor. Other candidates for the nomination, former City Controller William Klenk and former Commerce Director Al Gaudiosi, withdrew near the end of the primary.

In the general election, Green defeated Republican David Marston, a former United States Attorney, and former City Councilman Lucien Blackwell, a future U.S. Congressman and the Consumer Party nominee, to win election as mayor.

As mayor, Green was often forced by circumstances to make difficult and unpopular choices. He was required to balance a city budget still at a record high $285 million deficit inherited from Mayor Rizzo, the largest ever inherited by an incoming Philadelphia mayor. The resulting disputes with municipal labor unions, open battles with City Council, quiet disputes with campaign contributors, and an adversarial relationship with the mass media sapped his morale. &quot;Reporters are the type of people who tore the wings off flies when they were young,&quot; he complained at the time. His efforts to balance the budget were successful, however, and for the first time in years new businesses were choosing to relocate to Philadelphia, which won a national marketing award during the Green administration. In a city divided by race, Green appointed the first African American managing director, future Mayor Wilson Goode, aggressively supported Joseph Coleman as the first African American president of City Council, and appointed the first African American superintendent of the Philadelphia public schools, Constance Clayton. Another member of his cabinet was the city&#x27;s first female city solicitor. The Green administration is also remembered for having brought young talent into the City government: Chaka Fattah received his first government job in Green&#x27;s Commerce Department, one headed by Dick Doran; Ed Deseve, Green&#x27;s finance director, went on to head the U.S. Office of Management and the Budget in the administration of President Bill Clinton; Bill Marrazo, a Green commissioner of the Philadelphia Water Department, is now president of WHYY, Philadelphia&#x27;s principal public television station.

Green decided not to seek re-election during the Democratic primary and concentrated on his family when his wife Patricia became pregnant. Pat Green was 40 and Green feared for her health and the health of his unborn child if she faced the stress of a political campaign during the pregnancy. After his youngest child, Maura Elizabeth Green, was born healthy near the end of his term, Green joked, &quot;I am the winner&quot; of the 1983 mayoral contest.

Material in Mayor Green&#x27;s city archives files include correspondence, reports, and other materials relating to the various city departments, boards, commissions, and other city offices. Information is also available on the General Business Tax, the Mayor&#x27;s Tax Committee, the Mayor&#x27;s Scholarship Program of 1979–1980, cable TV, Century IV celebration, CETA, the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, energy, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers Strike of 1981, the Educational Nomination Panel of 1981–1982, Mayor&#x27;s and Cabinet members&#x27; schedules for 1980–1982, Conversation Hall renovations that were started by Green, council legislation, Freedom Festival, among many other topics.

==Post-mayoral career==
After his term as Mayor expired, Green practiced law, opened two restaurants in the emerging Manayunk section of Philadelphia, and passed up opportunities to run for the U.S. Senate in 1986 and 1991. He established himself as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist and purchased a home in suburban Virginia.

In the late 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s, Green pursued a successful career as vice president of government relations for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, a large holding company that includes Revlon.

In 2003, Green retired from MacAndrews &amp; Forbes and returned with his wife to Philadelphia, where he has since kept a low political profile. Some of his associates while he was mayor have dominated Republican mayoral politics in the decades since he has left office, but none has won election in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.

His son, William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Green, IV, was elected to Philadelphia City Council in 2007.

<text>USS &quot;MacKenzie&quot; (DD–175) was a in the United States Navy following World War I. In 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as the HMCS &quot;Annapolis&quot;.

== Construction and career ==

=== United States Navy ===
The second Navy ship to be named for Alexander Slidell MacKenzie, she was laid down by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California on 4 July 1918. The ship was launched on 29 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Percy J. Cotton. &quot;MacKenzie&quot; was commissioned on 25 July 1919. On 17 July 1920, she was designated &quot;DD-175&quot;.

Following commissioning and shakedown, &quot;MacKenzie&quot; became a unit of the Pacific Fleet and operated with Destroyer Squadrons 2 and 4 until decommissioned at Mare Island on 27 May 1922. &quot;MacKenzie&quot; remained in reserve until she recommissioned at San Diego on 6 November 1939.

In 1940, the ship was one of 50 destroyers exchanged for strategic bases off the North American coast under the terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. She arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 20 September 1940. She decommissioned and was turned over to the Royal Canadian Navy on 24 September and recommissioned as HMCS &quot;Annapolis&quot; on 2 October. &quot;MacKenzie&quot; was struck from the US Navy list 8 January 1941.

=== Royal Canadian Navy ===

Following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers, HMCS &quot;Annapolis&quot; was named after the Annapolis River of Nova Scotia; and, with deference to the U.S. origin, sharing a name of significance to the United States Naval Academy.

&quot;Annapolis&quot;″s no. 4 boiler was damaged during workup and was removed and not replaced, together with a funnel, during repair which continued until February 1941. Until 1944, &quot;Annapolis&quot; sailed with the Halifax and Western Local Escort Forces escorting convoys from east of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, to New York. In April 1944, she was attached to , near Annapolis, Nova Scotia, where she remained as a training ship until the end of the war. On 4 June 1945, she was turned over to the War Assets Corporation and sold to Frankel Brothers, Ltd., of Toronto for scrapping.

The ship&#x27;s bell of HMCS &quot;Annapolis&quot; is currently held by the town of Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia. The Christening Bells Project at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt Naval and Military Museum includes information from the ship&#x27;s bell of HMCS &quot;Annapolis&quot;, which was used for baptism of babies on board ship.

<doc id="1121322" wikidata="Q5775919" url="?curid=1121322" title="History of Dorset">
<text>[[Dorset]] is a rural county in south west England. Its archaeology documents much of the history of southern England.

==Pre-Roman==

The first known settlement of Dorset was by Mesolithic hunters, who returned to Britain at a time when it was still attached to Europe by a land-bridge, around 12,500 BC. The population was very small, maybe only a few thousand across the whole of Britain, and concentrated along the coast: in Dorset, such places as the Isle of Purbeck, Weymouth, Chesil Beach and Hengistbury Head, and along the Stour valley. These populations used stone tools and fire to clear some of the native oak forest for herding prey. Genetic experiments carried out on a Mesolithic skeleton from Cheddar Gorge (in the neighbouring county of Somerset) have shown that a significant part of the contemporary population of Dorset is descended from these original inhabitants of the British Isles.

This suggests that when a wave of immigrant farmers arrived from the continent in the Neolithic, the indigenous hunter-gatherers were not wiped out, but instead most likely adopted agricultural practices. Further woodland clearances took place at this stage, and also in the Bronze Age, to make way for agriculture and animal husbandry, although where the soils were poor and made permanent cultivation difficult, clearance led instead to the creation of heathland. Neolithic and Bronze Age burial mounds are particularly numerous throughout much of the county.

Dorset&#x27;s high chalk hills have provided a location for defensive settlements for millennia, with a large number of late Bronze Age but mostly Iron Age hill forts, such as Maiden Castle, Hod Hill, Badbury Rings and Hambledon Hill. The chalk downs were largely deforested during these times, making way for field and pasture. Some of the steeper slopes and hill tops are inaccessible or impractical for arable farming, and there the archaeology is relatively well preserved; the valley floors and broader hills have usually been ploughed, and hence do not have a good record of pre-Roman archaeology, although this does not mean that Iron Age peoples didn&#x27;t settle there. Indeed, many contemporary theories postulate that hillforts may not have been the main focus of settlement, but served more as a marketplace-cum-stronghold in times of danger, and in fact most of the time, the population was concentrated in the valleys. By the Late Iron Age, the inhabitants of Dorset were minting their own coinage and thriving on trade with Northern Gaul (Armorica, now known as Brittany). However, after Armorica was conquered by Julius Caesar in 56 BC, the trade dried up; the Romans re-arranged trade with Britain to the profit of their allies, the Trinovantes, in Essex. The next century or so until the Roman conquest saw a long drawn-out period of economic retrenchment in Dorset, in parallel with a rising population and a decline in soil quality (much of it had been in cultivation for 4,000 years). By the time of the Roman Conquest, it is likely that a combination of overpopulation and impoverishment of the soil left many people starving, to which bone analysis of skeletons from Bere Regis bears witness; several of the skeletons present ample evidence of numerous distinct episodes of severe malnourishment during childhood.

The Romans record the name of the native British tribe that lived in Dorset as the Durotriges, who were also the tribe of much of Somerset and possibly the New Forest. Sometimes translated as &quot;water dwellers&quot;, this name could mean that they were seafarers, but is more likely a reference to the marshy valley of the River Frome which they would have farmed. However, this etymology is unsound, based on the Welsh word &quot;dwr&quot; meaning water; however the earlier form of the word was &quot;dwfr&quot;, which suggests an Ancient British ancestor-word *dubro-, not *duro- (this form of the word is preserved in the place-name Dover). Another alternative is &quot;fort-dwellers&quot;; it is known that the Durotriges were still occupying their hillforts at the time of the Roman invasion in 43 AD, whereas in most other parts of Britain they had been abandoned around 100 BC. There is also a Cornish word &quot;dur&quot; meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;earth&quot;; hence the Durotriges might also be &quot;land-dwellers&quot;, referring to their already important farming tradition: it is known that they were exporting grain to the Roman Empire in large quantities already by the first century BC. The etymology of the first element is thus far from certain, although the second element definitely means &quot;dwellers&quot; (Cornish &quot;tre&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, &quot;tregez&quot; &quot;have lived&quot;; Welsh &quot;tref&quot; &quot;town&quot;).

==Roman==
The Romans landed in Dorset at Poole Harbour and the Fleet and moved inland, while other groups travelled west from Old Sarum and Winchester. At Abbotsbury on the Fleet the Romans quickly took the hill fort, Abbotsbury Castle, bloodlessly before moving on to Maiden Castle. There is some evidence of a struggle at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings but current opinion amongst archaeologists is that these, and Hod Hill, also fell with ease. There is, however, a find of 130 skeletons at Spetisbury which show that the invasion was not entirely peaceful.

Dorset has many notable Roman artefacts, particularly around the Roman town Dorchester, where Maiden Castle was taken early in the Roman occupation. In the grounds of the County Council offices is a Roman house with well preserved mosaic floors and an aqueduct fed by waters of a tributary of the Frome impounded behind an earthen dam, with a covered timber-lined channel of some nine km; the dam gave way and the aqueduct was abandoned unexpectedly early, in the mid-2nd century. Roman roads radiated from Dorchester, following the tops of the chalk ridges north west to Ilchester near Yeovil, and east to Badbury Rings where it forked to Winchester, Bath and a particularly well-preserved route running north east to Old Sarum near Salisbury, as well as tracks to the many small Roman villages around the county. In the Roman era settlements moved from the hill tops to the valleys, with Roman finds, such as the famous Hinton St Mary mosaic, being found in the vales. In the Isle of Purbeck a long-settled Iron Age site at Worth Matravers was reorganised late in the Roman period to grow grain for the legion, with a grain-parching granary floor heated with a hypocaust. By the 4th century the hilltops had been abandoned.

==Post-Roman==

Although there were Jutish and later Saxon people in the Southampton area from the 5th century, the Britons seem to have successfully resisted their expansion into future Dorset for a long period. One of the key battles (Mount Badon) between the Britons and Saxons may have been fought at Badbury Rings, though this is disputed. There may have been a Saxon raid at Bindon in 614, though the location is not certain.

==Saxon==
A large defensive ditch on Cranborne Chase in the north east of the county, Bokerley Dyke, dated to 367, appears to have been fortified and - along with the blocking of the Roman Road at Ackling Dyke, to have delayed the Saxon conquest of Dorset, with the Romano-British remaining in Dorset for 200 years after the withdrawal of the Roman legions. Evidence suggests that Dorset had been largely conquered by the West Saxons by the beginning of the reign of Caedwalla in 685. The inhospitable coastline prevented an invasion from the sea. When the Roman road across Cranborne Chase was rebuilt in the 6th century the Saxons advanced into Dorset. The Romano-British retreated, constructing another defence, Combs Ditch, which also fell within a century. It is thought that the Saxons captured east Dorset in the mid-7th century and west Dorset shortly afterwards, but the details are not known.

Dorset was initially part of Saxon Wessex, with the first record of Dorset being in 841. Coenred, the sub-king of Dorset at the end of the 7th century, was father of King Ine. St Martin&#x27;s church at Wareham is reputedly the oldest in Dorset but there were many other Saxon foundations including Shaftesbury Abbey and Sherborne Monastery. King Ethelred I (866–871) is buried at Wimborne, while St Cuthberga, abbess of Wimborne, died in 725. Gillingham is first mentioned in a 10th-century charter.

Aldhelm was the first bishop of the Diocese of Sherborne, created in 705 AD. This covered the part of Wessex &quot;west of Selwood&quot;.

In 876 King Alfred the Great trapped a Danish fleet at Arne then drove it out, 120 ships being wrecked at Studland. Corfe Castle in 978 saw the murder of King Edward the Martyr, whose body was taken first to Wareham and then to Shaftesbury.

==Middle Ages==


The Domesday Book documents many Saxon settlements corresponding to modern towns and villages, mostly in the valleys, and there have been few changes to the parishes since. Over the next few centuries the settlers established the pattern of farmland which prevailed into the nineteenth century. Many monasteries were also established, which were important landowners and centres of power.

A number of military events took place in Dorset during The Anarchy of the 12th century, and this gave rise to the defensive castles at Corfe Castle, Powerstock, Wareham and Shaftesbury. In 1348 the Black Death came to England, probably landing in ports along the south coast, including Melcombe Regis now part of Weymouth. The then busy port was one of the first towns to experience the epidemic which went on to wipe out a third of the population of the country. In the 14th and 15th centuries the hilltop villages shrank further, and many disappeared altogether. Throughout the Medieval period, Dorset was popular amongst the nobility, including a number of kings, for its hunting estates, such as Gillingham and Sherborne. A number of deer parks still remain in the county.
The 12th and 13th centuries saw much prosperity in Dorset and the population grew substantially as a result. In order to provide the extra food required, additional land was enclosed for farming during this time. The quarrying of Purbeck Marble, a limestone that can be polished, brought wealth into the county and provided employment for stonecutters and masons. Large amounts of the stone were used in the construction of Salisbury Cathedral. The trade continues today but has declined since the 15th century when alabaster from Derbyshire became popular.

Another mediaeval industry, which continues today, was the manufacture of rope. Bridport was particularly famous for its rope, so much so that the phrase &#x27;stabbed with the Bridport dagger&#x27; was commonly used to describe someone who had died at the hands of the hangman. Bridport rope was also purchased in large quantities by the Royal Navy. In the 15th century, Henry VII decreed that all hemp within a 5-mile radius of the town was to be reserved for the navy.

==Early Modern==

From the Tudor to Georgian periods farming specialised and the monastic estates broke up, leading to an increase in population and settlement size. The Dissolution of the Monasteries closed the abbeys at Sherborne, Shaftesbury, Milton Abbas, Abbotsbury and Cerne Abbas, though both Sherborne and Milton abbeys were saved from destruction. In 1588, eight ships from Dorset assisted in the destruction of the Spanish Armada. The flagship San Salvador still lies at the bottom of Studland bay. Sir Walter Raleigh later settled in Sherborne and served as MP for Dorset.

In the 17th-century English Civil War Dorset had a number of royalist strongholds, such as Sherborne Castle and Corfe Castle, which were ruined in the war. The 1642 Battle of Babylon Hill was indecisive. Corfe had already been successfully defended against an attack in 1643 but an act of betrayal during a second siege in 1646 led to its capture and subsequent slighting. The residents of Lyme Regis were staunch Parliamentarians who, in 1644, repelled three attacks by a Royalist army under King Charle&#x27;s nephew, Prince Maurice. Maurice lost 2,000 men in the assaults and his reputation was severely damaged as a result. The largest civil war battle in Dorset was not fought between Cavaliers and Roundheads however. The Dorset clubmen, a group of angry civilians who were annoyed by the disruption caused by the war, had no allegiance to either side. In 1645 some 5,000 of them gathered at Shaftesbury to do battle with Parliamentarian troops. Armed only with clubs and a variety of farming implements, they were easily dispersed. A smaller force of 2,000 or so regrouped on Hambledon Hill and were again routed. Many were taken prisoner and this was effectively the end for the organisation. The

In 1685, James Scott Monmouth, the illegitimate son of Charles II, and 150 supporters landed at Lyme Regis. After the failed Monmouth Rebellion, the &#x27;Bloody Assizes&#x27; took place in Dorchester where over a five-day period, Judge Jeffreys presided over 312 cases. 74 were executed; 29 were hanged, drawn and quartered; 175 were deported and many were publicly whipped. In 1686, at Charborough Park, a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England. This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution.

During the 18th century the Dorset coast saw much smuggling activity; its coves, caves and sandy beaches provided ample opportunities to slip smuggled goods ashore. In 1747 a notorious gang of armed smugglers broke into the customs house in Poole to reclaim their captured contraband. The production of cloth was a profitable business in Dorset during the 17th and 18th centuries. Blandford became famous for its bonelace and Stalbridge for its stockings. Shaftsbury, Sturminster Marshall, Beamister, Burton Bradstock, Gillingham, Cerne Abbas and Winterbourne Stickland produced a wide variety of materials between them, including sailcloth, linen and even silk. The absence of coal however meant that during the Industrial Revolution Dorset was unable to compete with the large mechanised mills of Lancashire and so remained largely rural. The Tolpuddle Martyrs lived in Dorset, and the farming economy of Dorset was central in the formation of the trade union movement.

==Modern==

The Industrial Revolution largely by-passed Dorset, which has remained largely rural. The farming economy, however, provided the spark for the Trade Union movement when, in the 1820s a group of farm labourers formed one of the first unions. In 1832 unions were outlawed and the six men, now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were transported, becoming national heroes to the working classes.

In the 19th century the railways bought increased mobility and communications to the British people. Lines through Dorset include the South West Main Line, from London to Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and Weymouth; the Heart of Wessex Line from Bristol to Sherborne, Dorchester and Weymouth; the West of England Main Line from London to Exeter, with stations at Sherborne and Gillingham; and the now dismantled Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway from Bath to Bournemouth. There were also a number of small branchlines, closed in the Beeching axe, such as those to Bridport and Swanage. The Swanage Railway has been reopened as a heritage railway.

During World War I and II Dorset, located on the English Channel, was both a target and important to the Royal Navy. The large Portland Harbour, built at the end of the 19th century and protected by Nothe Fort and the Verne Citadel, was for many years, including during the wars, one of the largest Royal Navy bases. British, American and Canadian ships gathered in the harbour and nearby in Weymouth bay before the D-Day landings. Training for the landings also took place in Dorset, at the long sandy beach at Studland. Portland Harbour continued to be used as a Royal Navy and NATO training base until the 1990s. It is now a civilian port and recreation area which was used for the sailing events in the 2012 Olympic Games.

Since the early 19th century, when George III took holidays in Weymouth while ill, Dorset&#x27;s tourism industry has grown, with the seaside resorts of Bournemouth and Weymouth, the Jurassic Coast and the county&#x27;s sparsely populated rural areas attracting millions of visitors each year. With farming declining across the country tourism now rivals agriculture as the main economy of the county.

In 1974 the political boundaries of Dorset were modified, incorporating a small area of south west Hampshire which included the towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. In 1996 Bournemouth and Poole became administratively independent from the county.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Dorset voted in favour of Brexit.

In the 2019 structural changes to local government in England, the ceremonial county of Dorset was changed from consisting of a non-metropolitan county (itself divided into six non-metropolitan districts) and two unitary authorities, into consisting of two unitary authorities. The new unitary authorities in Dorset became; Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, consisting of the old unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole as well as the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch; and Dorset Council, which merged the five remaining non-metropolitan districts of East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset, and Weymouth and Portland, as well as the former county council

<text>The deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (DD/CIA) is a statutory office () and the second-highest official of the Central Intelligence Agency. The DD/CIA assists the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) and is authorized to exercise the powers of the D/CIA when the director&#x27;s position is vacant or in the director&#x27;s absence or disability.

Under current law, the deputy director is appointed by the president of the United States and is not required to be confirmed by the United States Senate.

==History==
The functions of this position were served by the deputy director of central intelligence (DDCI) until that position was abolished under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The position of DD/CIA was created administratively by then-D/CIA Porter Goss and received statutory approval from the U.S. Congress in 2010.

The first DDCI was Kingman Douglass, appointed by the director of central intelligence in 1946, managing the Central Intelligence Group (CIG). With the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, the CIG was merged into the CIA. Thus, the position of DDCI predates the creation of the CIA.

In April 1953, Congress amended the National Security Act of 1947 to allow the president of the United States to appoint the DDCI (with U.S. Senate confirmation). The amendment stipulated that the director and deputy director positions could not be simultaneously filled by military officers.

==Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (2004–present)==

Hereafter the &quot;Deputy Director of Central Intelligence&quot; position was replaced by Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence&quot;.
==In popular culture==
In the novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the character Vice Admiral James Greer is the fictional Deputy Director of the CIA; former U.S. Marine Jack Ryan takes over this role after Admiral Greer&#x27;s death in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;. He subsequently retires from the position following a highly publicized media scandal and the detonation of a nuclear weapon at the Super Bowl in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;.

In the animated sitcom &quot;American Dad!&quot;, the character Avery Bullock is the fictional Deputy Director of the CIA.

In the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&quot;, the character Daniel Livingstone is the fictional Deputy Director of the CIA.

<doc id="1121329" wikidata="Q5245311" url="?curid=1121329" title="Dead Man Weds">
<text>Dead Man Weds is a six-part comedy series shown on ITV in Britain in January and early February 2005, and repeated on ITV2.

The series was written by Dave Spikey, who played the part of Jerry St Clair in &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. It was produced for ITV by the Red Production Company, and starred Spikey and Johnny Vegas.

The series concerns the staff of a fictional newspaper, &quot;The Fogburrow Advertiser&quot;, and the title of the series is a typical example of the paper&#x27;s front-page headlines; Spikey saw the headline on a newspaper billboard about a man who had died but was resuscitated and then later married. The billboard did not have quote marks around the word dead, which made Spikey laugh and so he developed the sitcom from that headline.

In the series, a new editor, Gordon Garden (played by Spikey), is determined to shake up the newspaper. The acting editor, Lewis Donat (played by Vegas), is convinced that he should have been made editor himself, and believes that journalism involves going on a break as soon as he gets in, stealing stories from old newspapers and getting the rest of the news from Joan at the cake shop, Cake That.

The series was filmed in several locations, notably Castleton in Derbyshire.

The theme music, also used as incidental music and stings throughout the series, is a version of Jonathan King&#x27;s composition &quot;It&#x27;s Good News Week&quot;, which was a hit for Hedgehoppers Anonymous in 1965.

The production company has announced that the series will not be released on DVD because of problems obtaining copyright clearance for the music used.

<text>Fort Caspar was a military post of the United States Army in present-day Wyoming, named after 2nd Lieutenant Caspar Collins, a U.S. Army officer who was killed in the 1865 Battle of the Platte Bridge Station against the Lakota and Cheyenne. Founded in 1859 along the banks of the North Platte River as a trading post and toll bridge on the Oregon Trail, the post was later taken over by the Army and named Platte Bridge Station to protect emigrants and the telegraph line against raids from Lakota and Cheyenne in the ongoing wars between those nations and the United States. The site of the fort, near the intersection of 13th Street and Wyoming Boulevard in Casper, Wyoming, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is now owned and operated by the City of Casper as the Fort Caspar Museum and Historic Site.

==History==
The area where Platte Bridge Station was located had been the site of various temporary Army encampments over a period of years before the establishment of the fort, or &quot;station&quot; itself. The fort was located on the south side of the North Platte, near the western edge of present-day Casper, at one several local points where the Emigrant Trail crossed from the south side to the north side of the river. In 1847, during the first Mormon wagon train to present-day Utah, Brigham Young commissioned a ferry at the site for later emigrants. The ferry consisted of cottonwood dugout canoes and planking for a deck, with two oars and a rudder. On June 19, Young named nine men to remain to operate the ferry while the remainder of the party continued the journey westward. A group of Mormons returned to the site each summer between 1847 and 1852 to operate the ferry. The ferry was moved to a different spot on the North Platte in North Casper in 1849. It was eventually replaced with a rope-and-pulley system that could make the crossing in five minutes.

In following years, trader John Baptiste Richard established a trading post several miles downriver of the crossing. The U.S. Army established its first presence in the area in 1855, erecting Fort Clay near Richard&#x27;s trading post. In 1859, when the site was part of the Nebraska Territory, Louis Guinard built a competing bridge at the trading post, called the Platte Bridge Station, at the site of the old Mormon Ferry crossing. From 1860 to 1861, the Pony Express operated a station at the site.

By the middle 1860s, the increasing presence of emigrants and other white settlers in the region began to cause friction with the Lakota and Cheyenne. In response, and partly to protect the new telegraph line, the Army began increasing its presence in the region in 1861 by sending a detachment to guard Guinard&#x27;s bridge. Many of these troops, who created a series of &quot;stations&quot; along the Oregon trail, were from various state units raised during the Civil War. In 1862 the Army used the buildings at Platte Bridge station while building and occupying Ft. Caspar.

Guinard, a naturalized U.S. citizen, born in Quebec around 1820 or 1821 had hired his nephew of the same name - Louis P. Guinard, also born in Quebec in 1840 - to come and help build this bridge. Louis P. came and worked for his uncle about three years, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1863. He worked on the actual building of the bridge as well as keeping his uncle&#x27;s financial records. Louis Guinard the uncle, fell from the bridge on June 6, 1865 and drowned, leaving the property to his nephew Louis P. Guinard, who took possession on July 15 of 1865. The will was discovered in 1866 and Louis P Guinard stated that he was advised by Major Bullock, sutler at Ft. Laramie, that the will left him as sole owner of the property and that he should remain and hold possession of it. The U.S. troops occupied Guinard&#x27;s buildings for three years during the Civil War. Louis P. Guinard stated that one of the officers promised him $1000 for use of the said buildings but he never received any payment. The bridge was later destroyed by Indians when the troops left in 1865, and with hundreds of Indians appearing on the opposite bank of the river, Guinard felt he had no choice but to leave for the protection of himself and his family. They had gone no more than 4 or 5 miles before he could tell from the smoke columns that the Indians were burning everything. Guinard had left his will in the safekeeping of Major Bullock at Ft. Laramie, having no way at the time to get it probated or secured in a bank. He later filed claim to be compensated for Indian depredations but Major Bullock told him the will was lost or destroyed. Unable to produce the will, the case dragged on in the courts for more than 25 years before it was finally abandoned and Guinard was never compensated for his losses.

===Battle of the Platte Bridge Station===
In July 1865, accompanied by survivors of the Sand Creek Massacre which occurred the previous November as part of the Colorado War, a party of several thousand Cheyenne and Sioux approached Platte Bridge Station from the north intending to attack the soldiers camped there and destroy the bridge. They had previously scouted the area and selected it because the soldiers there were not in the small trading post stockade of 14-foot pine logs but camped in tents. Initially only a small party of Indians showed themselves to the troops, the remainder of the Indians remaining concealed. By the afternoon of July 25, however, when a large raiding party had driven off a number of horses and forced the pursuing cavalry troopers to expend much ammunition, the station had permanent structures and a mountain howitzer of the 11th Ohio Cavalry covered the approaches to the bridge.

Late that night a detachment of 14 men of Company I, 3rd U.S. Volunteer Infantry led by Capt. Adam Smith Leib, escorted by 1st Lt. Henry C. Bretney and six (some accounts say 10) troopers of Company G, 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, arrived from Sweetwater Station en route to Fort Laramie for supplies and a long-overdue payroll. They found the station on 50% guard duty and molding bullets. Leib advised the station commander, Major Martin Anderson of the 11th Kansas Cavalry, that he had earlier passed a small train of five empty mule-drawn wagons returning from Sweetwater to Laramie, 14 teamsters escorted by 11 enlisted men of the 11th Kansas. Knowing that the train was due to come in the next morning, the officers at the post discussed sending out a relief force to drive off the Cheyenne and Lakota warriors, so that the wagon train could come safely in. Leib and Bretney suggested an immediate march but Anderson decided to wait for daylight. Bretney, who had succeeded to command of Company G on February 13 when its captain, Levi M. Rinehart, had been accidentally killed by a drunken trooper during a skirmish, was not on good terms with Anderson. On his arrival at Platte Bridge on July 16, the Kansan had replaced Bretney as post commander and ordered Company G to relocate to Sweetwater Station, escorting the same wagon train now returning from there. In addition, the 11th Kansas Cavalry was due to march to Fort Kearney on or about August 1 to muster out of service.

After reveille, all four of Anderson&#x27;s officers declined to lead the relief force and some placed themselves on the sick list to avoid the duty. 20-year-old 2nd Lt. Caspar W. Collins of Company G 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, en route back to his company farther west from a remount detail at Fort Laramie, had arrived the afternoon before with the mail ambulance and was ordered by Anderson to lead the relief. Bretney had no authority to countermand the order but advised Collins to refuse it. Instead Collins borrowed Bretney&#x27;s pistols and was given a mount from the regimental band. Among those leading the Indian warriors were Red Cloud and the famed warrior Roman Nose. George Bent, the half Cheyenne son of William Bent who survived the Sand Creek Massacre, participated in the battle as a Cheyenne warrior, and later wrote about it in his letters.

At dawn numerous Indians were observed by sentinels on the surrounding hills observing the station. At 7:00 a.m. a larger force forded the river east of the station and rode just out of rifle range, taunting the garrison. Collins and a small detachment of 25 men of the 11th Kansas crossed the Platte Bridge at a walk, then formed into a column of fours and rode west along the north bank at a trot to drive off any hostile Indians. Behind him, the contingent of the 3rd U.S.V.I. and its 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry escort crossed the bridge on foot as a support force for Collins, forming a skirmish line when they observed several hundred Cheyenne emerge from the sand hills and gulleys between themselves and Collins.

The Indians had concealed large bands of warriors near the bridge and over the crest of the hills, possibly as many as a thousand Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho. Collins wheeled his detachment into two lines and charged the first group to emerge, only to find himself heavily outnumbered. He then ordered a retreat to the bridge through the Cheyenne to his rear as yet another force, this of Lakota, attempted to rush the bridge. The skirmish line at the bridge held the Lakota at bay with volley fire until 20 of the 26 troopers, all wounded to some extent, fought their way through. Five were killed, including Collins, who was wounded in the hip and shot in the forehead with an arrow while trying to aid a wounded soldier. The battle lasted only a few minutes, with Bent claiming that the Lakota and Cheyenne suffered only a few casualties.

Bretney in a rage returned to the stockade and accused the Kansas officers of cowardice when Anderson refused to allow a larger force and the howitzer to attempt another relief. Anderson placed Bretney under arrest and turned over the post&#x27;s defenses to Leib, who had the garrison throw up an embrasure and dig rifle pits to protect the howitzer at the south end of the bridge. During the morning the attacking force destroyed a thousand feet of telegraph wire on the line to Fort Laramie before Anderson thought to request reinforcements, then drove off the detail sent to repair it, killing another trooper.

The wagon train, commanded by Sergeant Amos J. Custard, was attacked approximately five miles to the west, within sight of the station, at around 11:00 a.m. According to the Indians the battle lasted about half an hour with one person escaping, a teamster, 22 troopers killed along with 8 Indian warriors. Many Indian warriors were wounded. The Indians, as was their custom, took no prisoners. However Army accounts state that the wagons were forced into a hollow where they held out for four hours, using fire from Spencer rifles to repel assaults until a large group closed on foot and overwhelmed the defenders, killing all. The wagons were burned at approximately 3:00 p.m. Corporal James A. Shrader and four troopers, sent as scouts by Custard to investigate the sound of the howitzer firing, were cut off and pursued by a hundred Cheyenne led by the brother of Roman Nose, Left Hand, who was killed in the running fight. Eventually Shrader and two men made their way on foot into the station. Two Shoshone scouts were paid to take a message requesting reinforcements to the next telegraph station east, but the attacking force broke up before relief arrived.

The battle became known as the Battle of Platte Bridge Station. The battle of the wagon train also became known as the Battle of Red Buttes, although that location was ten miles further to the west. Army fatalities in both actions numbered 27 men of the 11th Kansas Cavalry and Lt. Collins, with at least ten seriously wounded. Historian Robert Utley placed combined Indian casualties in all the July forays around Platte Bridge Station as 60 killed and 130 wounded. The Army officially renamed the post Fort Caspar to honor Collins, using his given name to differentiate the post from an existing fort in Colorado named after Collins&#x27; father.

===Abandonment===
The fort was abandoned two years later in August 1867, with the garrison moved to Fort Fetterman at Douglas, Wyoming.

===Restoration and Museum===
Fort Caspar was partially reconstructed in 1936 using sketches made by Lieutenant Collins in 1863. The fort itself underwent a lot of changes during its occupation, and the current recreation reflects the post in 1863-1865. The City of Casper now operates a museum at the site, which features reconstructed log buildings, including a wooden stockade. The site also includes a replica of the Mormon ferry that was operated there between 1847 and 1849, as well as a model of part of the bridge that later replaced the ferry. In early December members of a living history group portraying a company of the 3rd US Infantry host a historical reenactment at the site.

<text>A versatilist is someone who can be a specialist for a particular discipline, while at the same time be able to change to another role with the same ease.

The term &quot;versatilist&quot; was used in a 2005 article from Gartner, where it states that &quot;Versatilists are able to apply a depth of skill to a progressively widening scope of situations and experiences, equally at ease with technical issues as with business strategy.&quot; A 2006 article by George Hayward mentioned versatilist in the Industrial Safety and Health Network publication &quot;FDO&quot; (For Distributors Only). George Hayward wrote articles for the publication from 1997. He died in 2009.

It is to the advantage of an organization to employ versatilists—because an enterprise will be able to easily redeploy this type of employee based on changes in business requirements or strategy.

To illustrate this using a mathematical concept, the versatilist has a higher area under the curve rating. Think of a person having some level of knowledge/experience in 15 knowledge areas. That person may have a very high competency (score 5) in 3 areas, a medium level of competency (score 3) in 5 areas an introductory level of competency (score 1) in 4 areas and no competency (score 0) in 3 areas. This creates an area under the curve of 34. This is different from a specialist who may score very high in one area and have no competency in others. This is also different from a generalist who may score a 1 or 3 in every area.

This breadth of knowledge and experience is what enables faster changes to other roles.

<doc id="1121335" wikidata="Q2893202" url="?curid=1121335" title="David Ives">
<text>David Ives (born July 11, 1950) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. He is perhaps best known for his comic one-act plays; &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1997 referred to him as the &quot;maestro of the short form&quot;. Ives has also written dramatic plays, narrative stories, and screenplays, has adapted French 17th and 18th-century classical comedies, and adapted 33 musicals for New York City&#x27;s &quot;Encores!&quot; series.

==Early life and education==
Ives wrote his first play when he was nine. He attended a boys Catholic seminary. &quot;We would-be priests were groomed for gravitas,&quot; he has said. At the end of the year the seniors could be a part of a school show called &quot;The Senior Mock,&quot; in which the students satirized the teachers. Ives played the role of &quot;the chain-smoking English teacher who coached the track team (while smoking)&quot;, and he wrote and performed a song. This school experience, along with seeing a production of Edward Albee’s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, were two early events that inspired his interest in theatre.

Ives attended Northwestern University, majoring in English. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1971. He traveled to Germany, where he taught English. Ives graduated from the Yale School of Drama with a Master of Fine Arts in 1984.

==Theater==

His play, &quot;Canvas&quot;, was produced in California in 1972, and then at Circle Repertory Company in New York City. In New York Ives worked as an editor for William P. Bundy, the editor at &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine. Ives wrote three full-length plays: &quot;St. Freud&quot; (1975), &quot;The Lives and Deaths of the Great Harry Houdini&quot;, and &quot;City of God&quot;. In 1983 Ives was playwright-in-residence at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts where &quot;The Lives and Deaths of the Great Harry Houdini&quot; was produced.

In 1987 his short play &quot;Words, Words, Words&quot; was presented at the Manhattan Punch Line Theatre, followed by &quot;Sure Thing&quot;, &quot;Variations on the Death of Trotsky&quot;, &quot;Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Universal Language&quot;. A two-act play, &quot;Ancient History&quot; was produced Off-Broadway in 1989 by Primary Stages.

Ives&#x27; &quot;All in the Timing&quot;, an evening of six one-act plays, premiered at Primary Stages in 1993, moved to the larger John Houseman Theatre, and ran for 606 performances. In a review &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;there is indeed a real heart ... There is sustenance as well as pure entertainment.&quot; Critic Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;Ives [is] wizardly ... magical and funny ... a master of language. He uses words for their meanings, sounds and associations, spinning conceits of a sort I’ve not seen or heard before. He’s an original.&quot; It won the Outer Critics Circle John Gassner Award for Playwriting, was included in &quot;Best Plays of 1993 — 1994&quot;, and in 1995 — 1996 was the most performed play in the country after William Shakespeare’s plays.

Ives’ full-length play &quot;Don Juan in Chicago&quot; premiered off-Broadway in New York at Primary Stages, on March 25, 1995. &quot;The Red Address&quot;, a full-length drama, premiered in New York at Second Stage Theater in January 1997.

An evening of one-act plays, &quot;Mere Mortals and Others&quot;, opened off-Broadway at Primary Stages in New York, May 13, 1997. Peter Marks of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a collection of six fast and ferociously funny comedies ... a madcap evening of one-acts&quot;, and noted that Ives has the &quot;gratifying ability to unharness the intoxicating power of language and at the same time entertain.&quot;

&quot;Polish Joke&quot;, a full-length play, has been described as loosely autobiographical. It premiered in the summer of 2001 at the Contemporary Theatre of Seattle, and then opened in New York at the Manhattan Theatre Club in February 2003, in the cast in New York was Walter Bobbie, who would later be the director of &quot;Venus in Fur&quot;.

&quot;The Blizzard&quot; is a short play that was written as part of a theatrical concept that began in 1995 on the lower East Side of Manhattan, in which a group of writers, actors and directors would gather together to create a play from scratch, rehearse it, and perform it — all within 24 hours. &quot;The Blizzard,&quot; and eight of Ives&#x27; other short plays, was produced on the radio by Playing On Air, directed by John Rando and starred Jesse Eisenberg.

Primary Stages presented a revival of &quot;All in the Timing&quot; in January 2013. This new production was directed by John Rando.

His plays have been published in the anthologies &quot;All in the Timing&quot;, &quot;Time Flies&quot;, and &quot;Polish Joke And Other Plays&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Ives contributed pieces to &quot;Spy Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine named him one of the &quot;100 Smartest New Yorkers&quot;. When asked by the magazine to comment on being so listed for the same issue, Ives’ response began, &quot;Grocery lists. Spelling lists. Laundry lists. The very idea of lists has something inherently narrow, petty, unpoetic about it. &quot;List, list, O list!&quot; cried Hamlet’s father&#x27;s ghost in exasperation, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more...&quot;

His translation of Georges Feydeau&#x27;s farce &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; was produced at Chicago Shakespeare in 2006, and won the Joseph Jefferson Award for &quot;new adaptation&quot;. His play, &quot;Is He Dead?&quot; adapted from an &quot;unproduced 1898 comedy&quot; by Mark Twain, ran on Broadway from December 2007 to March 2008. &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, concerning the excommunication of Baruch Spinoza, opened Off-Broadway in January 2008 (previews from December 2007) in a Classic Stage Company production. &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; won a Hull-Warriner Award.

In 2010, he adapted Pierre Corneille&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Liar&quot; for The Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. It won the Charles MacArthur Award for Outstanding New Play at the Helen Hayes Awards in Washington the following year. In 2011 his version of Molière’s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; premiered Off-Broadway at Classic Stage Company under the title, &quot;The School For Lies&quot;. Also in 2011 his adaptation of Jean-Francois Regnard’s &quot;Le Legataire universel&quot; premiered at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. under the title, &quot;The Heir Apparent&quot;. &quot;The Heir Apparent&quot; opened Off-Broadway in March 2014 (previews) at the Classic Stage Company, and ran through May 2014.

&quot;Venus in Fur&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the Classic Stage Company in January 2010 with Nina Arianda and Wes Bentley. &quot;Venus in Fur&quot; premiered on Broadway in October 2011 (previews) at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. Nina Arianda returned to the role she created Off-Broadway and Hugh Dancy played the role originated by Bentley. Walter Bobbie once again directed. The play transferred to the Lyceum Theatre in February 2012 for an extended run with Arianda and Dancy reprising their performances.

&quot;All in the Timing&quot; was, after Shakespeare plays, the most produced play in the United States during the 1995–1996 season, and &quot;Venus in Fur&quot; was most produced, after Shakespeare plays, during the 2013–2014 season.

His &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; began in previews Off-Broadway at Primary Stages in February 2015, running through March 27, 2015. Directed by John Rando, &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; consists of seven short plays. The plays are: &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, &quot;The Mystery at Twicknam Vicarage&quot;, &quot;Babel&#x27;s in Arms&quot;, &quot;Soap Opera&quot;, &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot;, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, and &quot;Captive Audience.&quot; Several of the plays had been produced previously. &quot;The Lives of the Saints&quot; was produced with five of the plays at the Berkshire Theatre Festival, Stockbridge, Massachusetts in August and September 1999.

His play, &quot;The Liar&quot;, based on a 17th-century play by Pierre Corneille opened at the Classic Stage Company in New York January 26, 2017.

He has continued to base plays on 17th century French plays: in 2017, &quot;The School for Lies&quot;, based on Moliere&#x27;s play &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, opened at the Lansburgh Theatre in Washington, DC.

In April 2018, Red Bull Theater presented the New York premiere &quot;The Metromaniacs,&quot; his &quot;translaptation&quot; of a rediscovered French farce by Alexis Piron at The Duke on 42nd Street directed by Michael Kahn.

==Musical theatre==
In the early 1990s Ives started working in musical theatre, writing the libretto for an opera based on Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (music by Greg Pliska). It premiered in Philadelphia in 1991 at the Pennsylvania Opera Theater.

He then became a regular adapter for the New York City Center Encores! series of American musicals in concert, starting with &quot;Out Of This World&quot; in 1995, &quot;Du Barry Was A Lady&quot; in 1996, and working on two or three a year until 2012. As of 2013, Ives ended his writing for Encores!, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve very happily done 33 adaptations for Encores! But there comes a time when it&#x27;s time for someone else to have that pleasure, especially given how full my platter is these days.&quot; His Encores! adaptation of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; moved to Broadway&#x27;s Al Hirschfeld Theatre in 2003, directed by Kathleen Marshall.

He adapted David Copperfield&#x27;s magic show, &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot;, which premiered on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre in December 1996. He also adapted Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1998) and Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; (with Reba McEntire) for concert performances at Carnegie Hall, as well as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; for a staged concert at Avery Fisher Hall in New York in 2007.

He helped to rework the book for the Broadway version of the musical &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;, with book, music and lyrics by Jim Steinman and original German book and lyrics by Michael Kunze. The musical opened on Broadway in October 2002 in previews, and closed in January 2003 after 56 performances. He co-wrote the book for &quot;Irving Berlin&#x27;s White Christmas&quot;, which premiered in San Francisco in 2004 and then went on to tour across the United States. It had a limited engagement on Broadway from November 2008 to January 2009, and also from November 2009 to January 2010.

Ives began collaborating with Stephen Sondheim on a new untitled musical based on two films by Luis Buñuel, initially set to premiere in 2017. Development on the show faltered, but during a September 15, 2021 appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Sondheim announced he was working on a new musical called &quot;Square One&quot; in collaboration with David Ives. Nathan Lane and Bernadette Peters were involved in a reading of the new work. Renamed as &quot;Here We Are&quot;, the musical collaboration inspired by &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; and &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; would have a limited engagement world premiere in September 2023, running through January 2024 at The Shed.

==Narrative fiction==
Ives wrote &quot;The Phobia Clinic&quot;, a full-length narrative verse-novel published in 2010. It is described as a philosophical horror novel written in verse. It is, according to the author, &quot;grotesque, satirical, personal, sometimes funny, but mostly reflecting the mood of the title.&quot; Inspired by Dante, &quot;The Phobia Clinic&quot; employs the verse form of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, known as &quot;terza rima&quot;, with the lines grouped in threes, and each group, or tercet, following the rhyme scheme ABA BCB CDC DED throughout Ives&#x27; 55 cantos.

Ives wrote a young adult book, &quot;Monsieur Eek&quot;, which was released in 2001. The book is set in 1609, and is a &quot;fairy tale–like story full of absurd characters who make bizarre interpretations...&quot; His next book was &quot;Scrib&quot; (2005), set in the American West in 1863. His book &quot;Voss: How I Come to America and Am Hero, Mostly&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Personal==
Ives lives in New York City with his wife, Martha Ives, a book illustrator, a linoprint artist and a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists.

<text>The second USS &quot;Renshaw&quot; (DD–176) was a in the United States Navy following World War I . She was named for William B. Renshaw.

==History==
&quot;Renshaw&quot; was laid down 8 May 1918 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; launched 21 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Frank Johnson; and commissioned 31 July 1919.

&quot;Renshaw&quot; was assigned to the Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. She joined the Fleet in Monterey Bay, and passed in review for the Secretary of the Navy who observed the Fleet from . &quot;Renshaw&quot; departed San Francisco 16 September for her base of operations, San Diego, where she arrived on the 20th. Her brief service was none too active, since small appropriations limited most units of the Fleet to routine target practice and engineering competition. The destroyer participated in exercises off the California coast, performed patrol and dispatch duty, transported prisoners, and made one training cruise with naval reservists out of Portland, Oregon.

&quot;Renshaw&quot; cruised to Hawaii from 25 March to 28 April 1920, with Destroyer Flotilla 11, to conduct a thorough reconnaissance of the islands with a view toward establishing an operating base for the Fleet. During the period from 16 December 1920 to 4 April 1921, the ship was at the Puget Sound Navy Yard for overhaul, returning to base on 8 April to rejoin the Destroyer Force.

In January 1922 &quot;Renshaw&quot; calibrated radio compasses for the 12th Naval District. She returned to San Diego 28 January and remained moored, except for a brief trip to San Pedro 20–24 February, until decommissioned 27 May 1922. The destroyer was laid up at San Diego until disposed of in 1936 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament. She was struck from the Navy list 19 May 1936, sold 29 September to Schiavone Bonomo Corporation, and reduced to a hulk 2 December 1936.

<text>Mossflower is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1988. It is the second book published and third chronologically in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

== Plot summary ==

The story begins in the Mossflower Wood, where a community of animals suffers under the tyranny of a ruling polecat named Verdauga Greeneyes. When a mouse from the north by the name of Martin the Warrior travels to Mossflower Woods, he is captured and brought to the castle Kotir. While there, his sword is broken by Verdauga&#x27;s daughter, Tsarmina, and he is imprisoned within the Kotir dungeons. Meanwhile, Tsarmina poisons Verdauga with the help of the vixen Fortunata and blames it on her brother Gingivere. She places her brother in prison and takes the throne for herself.

While in the dungeons, Martin eventually meets Gonff the Mousethief, who was imprisoned for stealing food from the Kotir storages. Meanwhile, Abbess Germaine and the surviving members of Loamhedge, an abbey stricken with a plague, arrive and join the woodlanders. Martin and Gonff escape with help from the Corim (Council Of Resistance In Mossflower) and join with Young Dinny the mole on a quest to find Boar the Fighter, Badger Lord of Salamandastron. Bella, a Corim leader and Boar&#x27;s daughter, believed only her father could defeat Tsarmina and put an end to her cruel reign.

The crew sets out on the quest to find Boar. They are pursued by Splitnose the stoat, Blacktooth the ferret, and their leader, Scratch the weasel. The trio eventually dies- Scratch by a swan, and Splitnose and Blacktooth in a duel. The crew eventually comes to a river with a ferry, where they meet a snake and a newt who threaten to kill the travellers. A shrew emerges and scares away the duo into the river, and introduces himself as Log-a-log Big Club, a former village leader, escaped oar slave, and currently a ferryman. He joins the group on its quest. They sail on his boat, &quot;Waterwing&quot; to the mountains. The ship is broken in a waterfall. When Martin comes to, he is in a huge mountain ruled by bats, called Bat Mountpit. After Martin, Dinny and Log-a-log help scare away the tawny owl that nests on the rooftop, they leave. They get ambushed by toads, and get thrown into the &quot;Screamhole&quot;, where they reunite with Gonff. They meet the Snakefish, the massive eel who is trapped in the hole, and formulate a plan to escape. They eventually escape with the help of the Snakefish, who wreaks havoc among the toads. The group reaches the beach. They trek through the sand, attacked by birds. Deprived from food and water, they witness gulls kill a rat. They stay at the rat&#x27;s hut, and continue the next day, with Salamandastron very near. The companions reach Salamandastron with the help of a few hares, and meet with Boar the Fighter. Boar introduces them to the hares that live in the mountain, and then reforges Martin&#x27;s broken sword with metal from a meteorite, but is killed while fighting his mortal enemy Ripfang the searat who had attacked Salamandastron several times before. Ripfang&#x27;s former oarslaves and several members of Log a Log&#x27;s former tribe take over the sea rat ship, &quot;Bloodwake&quot;, with help from Martin and his allies. They return to Mossflower Woods, where Martin kills Tsarmina and destroys Kotir by both flooding it and knocking over its walls with a ballista. In the final battle with Tsarmina, Martin is left near death. With the help of the woodlanders, he eventually recovers, but his memory is never the same thereafter, as evidenced in &quot;The Legend of Luke.&quot;

The book ends with Bella&#x27;s son, Sunflash, finding Salamandastron and becoming its ruler.
