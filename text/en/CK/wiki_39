<text>The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Pittsburgh Cycle&quot;. Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of &quot;acquir[ing] a sense of self-worth by denying one&#x27;s past&quot;. &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and earned five nominations at the 44th Tony Awards.

A Romare Bearden painting, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African-American history, paralleling Troy in earlier &quot;Fences&quot;. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self-worth. What &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; finally seems to ask is: &quot;What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use?&quot;

Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter&#x27;s land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great-grandfather&#x27;s wife and son during the days of their enslavement.

The play was adapted into a television film of the same name in 1995, which won a Peabody Award and received multiple nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards. It was later adapted again in 2024 for Netflix. The 2013 Off-Broadway production earned four Lucille Lortel Awards and two Obie Awards, while the 2023 revival of the play earned Tony Award nominations for Best Revival of a Play and Best Featured Actor in a Play for Samuel L. Jackson.

== Plot ==
===Act 1===
Scene 1: Boy Willie and Lymon arrive in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from Mississippi and enter the Charles&#x27; household at five in the morning. They have brought a truck of watermelons to sell. Against Doaker&#x27;s advice, Boy Willie wakes his sister Berniece, and tells her of Sutter&#x27;s death. Berniece accuses Boy Willie of shoving Sutter down a well, and she asks him to leave. Instead, Boy Willie wakes Berniece&#x27;s daughter, Maretha, causing Berniece to run back up the stairs where she sees Sutter&#x27;s ghost. Lymon notices the piano which Willie intends to sell to buy Sutter&#x27;s land. Doaker insists that Berniece will not sell the piano, because she refused to sell when Avery brought a buyer to the house. Willie insists that he will convince her. Maretha comes downstairs, and Willie asks her to play the piano. She plays the beginning of a few simple tunes, and he answers her song with a boogie-woogie. Berniece enters with Avery, and Willie asks whether she still has the prospective buyer&#x27;s name, explaining he came to Pittsburgh to sell the piano. Berniece refuses to listen and walks out.

Scene 2: Wining Boy and Doaker talk in the kitchen when Boy Willie and Lymon enter and claim to have located the piano buyer. Willie&#x27;s uncles warn him that Sutter will cheat him but Boy Willie refuses to listen. The story behind Lymon and Boy Willie&#x27;s term in Parchman Prison Farm is revealed. Lymon and Willie both gather different perspectives from their experiences. Lymon wants to flee to the North where he will be better treated, while Willie feels that whites only treat blacks badly if the blacks do not try to stop them. They ask Wining Boy to play the piano, but instead he explains that being seen as nothing more than a piano player became a burden. Doaker then tells the story of the piano&#x27;s history. Generations earlier, Sutter, their family&#x27;s slave-owner, broke up a family by selling a mother and child to pay for the piano which he bought for his wife as an anniversary present. The wife was happy with the piano but missed having the slaves, so Sutter had that family&#x27;s husband/father (who was a carpenter and too valuable to sell), carve their likenesses on the piano. He carved likenesses of his entire history on the piano. In 1911, Boy Willie&#x27;s father stole the piano from the Sutters; in retaliation he was killed. Willie declares that these are stories of the past and that the piano should now be put to good use. Willie and Lymon attempt to move the piano to test its weight. As soon as they try to move it, Sutter&#x27;s ghost is heard. Berniece tells Willie to stop and informs him that he is selling his soul for money. Willie refutes her, Berniece blames Crawley&#x27;s death on Willie, and the two engage in a fight. Upstairs, Maretha is confronted by the ghosts, and she screams in terror.

===Act 2===
Scene 1: Doaker and Wining Boy are again together in the house alone. Doaker confesses that he saw Sutter&#x27;s ghost playing the piano and feels that Berniece should discard the piano so as to prevent spirits from traumatizing the Charles family. Wining Boy disagrees. Lymon and Willie walk into the room after a watermelon sale. Wining Boy sells his suit and shoes to Lymon, promising its swooning effects on women. Both Lymon and Willie leave the house in hot pursuit of women.

Scene 2: Later that day as Berniece is preparing for her bath, Avery enters and proposes that Berniece should open up and let go. He tells her that she cannot continue to live her life with Crawley&#x27;s memory shut inside her. Berniece changes the topic and asks Avery to bless the house, hoping to destroy the spirit of the Sutter ghost. Avery then brings up the piano and tells Berniece she should learn to not be afraid of her family&#x27;s spirits and play it again. Berniece breaks down her story of her mother&#x27;s tears and blood mingled with her father&#x27;s soul on the piano and refuses to open her wounds for everyone to see.

Scenes 3–5: Boy Willie enters the Charles house with Grace and begins to fool around on the couch. Berniece orders them out and opens the door to see Lymon. Lymon is upset over his inability to woo women and begins to talk about women&#x27;s virtues to Berniece. The two kiss, breaking Berniece&#x27;s discomfort over Crawley&#x27;s death, and Berniece heads back upstairs. The next morning, Lymon and Willie try to move the piano out and are stopped by Uncle Doaker. Willie, frustrated, demands that he will sell the piano no matter what. The day to move the piano draws closer. Excited to sell the piano, Willie quickly partakes on his actions without a care of his sister&#x27;s words. Berniece appears with Crawley&#x27;s gun, leading Doaker and Avery to urge them to talk it through first. Sutter&#x27;s presence as a ghost is suddenly revived. Avery attempts to drive the ghost away with his blessings but is not successful. Suddenly, Berniece knows that she must play the piano again as a plea to her ancestors. Finally, the house is led to a calm aura, and Willie leaves to head back to Mississippi. Before leaving however, he reminds Berniece to keep playing on the piano, or he and Sutter will return.

== Characters ==
Doaker Charles: The owner of the Charles household; the uncle of Berniece and Boy Willie. He lives with his niece Berniece and great-niece Maretha. A tall and thin 47-year-old man, Charles recounts the most detailed parts of his lives with his job on the railroad. Doaker plays the role of the storyteller, giving detailed and long accounts of the piano&#x27;s history. Due to his old age, his connection to the past is expressed through his stories.
:&quot;Ain&#x27;t nobody said nothing about who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong. I was just telling the man about the piano. I was telling him why we say Berniece ain&#x27;t gonna sell it.&quot;
Doaker is also one of the only characters that truly understand Berniece&#x27;s desire not to sell the piano so that the legacy of their family may remain. He may maintain a neutral view of whether the piano should be kept or sold, but he does prevent Boy Willie from taking the piano and bolting without Berniece&#x27;s knowledge.

Boy Willie: Berniece&#x27;s impulsive 30-year-old brother represents the lack of accepting one&#x27;s past. A sharecropper and recently delivered out of prison from Mississippi, Boy Willie plans to sell the piano and use the earnings to buy the land where his ancestors had formerly toiled. His use of the legacy comes down to practicality; Willie finds the rich culture of his history engraved on the piano through pictures, blood, and tears to be a simple conversion to money. Rather than looking upon his past and accepting it, Boy Willie finds the constant need to prove himself as equal to the white man.
:&quot;If my daddy had seen where he could have traded that piano in for some land of his own, it wouldn&#x27;t be sitting up here now. He spent his whole life farming on somebody else&#x27;s land. I ain&#x27;t gonna do that. See, he couldn&#x27;t do no better. When he come along he ain&#x27;t had nothing he could build on. His daddy ain&#x27;t had nothing to give him. The only thing my daddy had to give me was that piano. And he died over giving me that. I ain&#x27;t gonna let it sit up there and rot without trying to do something with it.&quot;
Unable to understand the importance of keeping one&#x27;s legacy around one to understand and grow from it, Boy Willie only concerns himself with labels and capital. In the last scene of the book, after Berniece calls to the ancestors, Boy Willie finally understands that there is no escape from living his ancestral legacy and the only way to benefit from it is to learn from it.

Lymon: Lymon is the 29-year-old friend of Boy Willie and is much more secretive and shy in comparison; however, upon becoming more comfortable with the family, his attitude changes to be a sympathizer who doesn&#x27;t offer many original opinions. He does not speak brashly and attempts to escape the law by staying in the North and starting a new life.
:&quot;Yeah, I can see why you say that now. I told Boy Willie he ought to stay up here with me.&quot;
One of the few characters in this play not related to the members of the Charles household, Lymon offers help and sporadic advice to the other characters. He listens to Doaker&#x27;s version of the piano story, sympathizes with Boy Willie&#x27;s desires to sell the piano, and attempts to understand Berniece&#x27;s connection to the piano. Lymon is also obsessed with women and plays a large role in allowing Berniece to slowly relieve the mourning of Crawley, her deceased husband.
:&quot;I just dream about woman. Can&#x27;t never seem to find the right one.&quot;
His desire to please women and find his soul mate softens Berniece&#x27;s gaze on crude men and gives him a slight leeway to kiss her.

Berniece: The 35-year-old mother of Maretha, Berniece symbolizes the guardian of her ancestors&#x27; past. She remains the only member of the family to adamantly demand the keepsake of the piano heirloom. Her relation with her brother further portrays her mourning of her late husband Crawley. Blaming Boy Willie for Crawley&#x27;s death, Berniece questions Boy Willie&#x27;s foolish actions more than others. While Boy Willie represents an opposing figure to their father Boy Charles by wanting to be a property-owning man, Berniece draws similarities to her mother Mama Ola, who never seemed to recover from the mourning of her husband, either.
:&quot;Look at this piano. Look at it. Mama Ola polished this piano with her tears for seventeen years. For seventeen years she rubbed on it till her hands bled. Then she rubbed the blood in...mixed it up with the rest of the blood on it. Every day that God breathed life into her body she rubbed and cleaned and polished and prayed over it. &#x27;Play something for me, Berniece. Play something for me, Berniece.&#x27; Every day... You always talking about your daddy but you ain&#x27;t never stopped to look at what his foolishness cost your mamma.&quot;
Berniece feels as if the piano should stay in the home rather be sold as it is a family heirloom. The piano is in her residence and was the one who was led to the piano first. She did not feel the need to rearrange her ancestors&#x27; past and instead embraced it. To Berniece, the piano represents her father&#x27;s life, since he died over it, and her mother&#x27;s toil, since she incessantly asked Berniece to play after his death. Originally playing the role of the messenger between the dead ancestors and the living descendants, Berniece prefers to stop channeling her family&#x27;s ghosts after her mother&#x27;s death. Since she does not want to disturb the spirits in the piano, Berniece leaves the piano untouched and does not play it.
:&quot;I told you I don&#x27;t play on that piano...When my mama died I shut the top on that piano and I ain&#x27;t never opened it since. I was only playing it for her. When my daddy died seem like all her life went into that piano. She used to have me play on it...say when I played it she could hear my daddy talking to her. I used to think them pictures come alive and walked through the house. Sometime late at night I could hear my mama talking to them. I said that wasn&#x27;t gonna happen to me I don&#x27;t play that piano &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t want to wake them spirits. They never be walking around in this house.&quot;
To save her daughter from the burdens that Berniece had to endure from playing the piano and helping her mother go through the pain and misery of losing her husband, Berniece refuses to let the spirits of her ancestors come back into her life. However, in the last scene, Berniece finally resumes her role as the middle person between the living and dead. In this last scene, Berniece plays the piano again and fulfills her duty to her family&#x27;s legacy.

Maretha: The 11-year-old daughter of Berniece, Maretha plays the role of the future generation for the Charles family. Although Berniece teaches her how to play the piano, she does not allow any history of the piano to become apparent to Maretha.
:&quot;Maretha...don&#x27;t know nothing about it...She don&#x27;t have to carry all of that with her. She got a chance I didn&#x27;t have. I ain&#x27;t gonna burden her with that piano.&quot;
Maretha&#x27;s encounters with ghosts are approached without Berniece&#x27;s liking. Maretha also allows experimentation among the future progeny of the Charles family, leading observations regarding the best way to pass down family history.

Avery Brown: A 38-year-old preacher who has been attempting to court Berniece ever since the death of Crawley, Avery Brown is a man of honest and good intentions. Constantly stressing his Christian view on things and advocating his hopes to build a congregation, Avery is aware that Berniece will never sell her piano heirloom. Also not related to the Charles family, Avery often offers advice to Berniece in an effort to help her let go of the fears of her past and the lingering mourning of her husband.
:&quot;You got to put all that behind you, Berniece. That&#x27;s the same thing like Crawley. Everybody got stones in their passway. You got to step over them or walk around them. You picking them up and carrying them with you. All you got to do is set them down by the side of the road. You ain&#x27;t got to carry them with you. You can walk over there right now and play that piano...and God will walk over there with you.&quot;
Avery&#x27;s humble personality further emphasizes Berniece&#x27;s lack of relieving her deceased husband&#x27;s memory. He tries desperately to help her find her path and supports her through her pain. In the final scene, Avery&#x27;s blessings on the house help bring Berniece back to her position of communicating between the living and the deceased.

Wining Boy: The comical figure in &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;, the Wining Boy is the 56-year-old elder brother of Doaker Charles. He tries to portray the image of a successful musician and gambler, but his music and attire are extremely dated. Instead of wanting to live in the present and the future like his nephew Boy Willie, Wining Boy drowns himself in the sorrows of his past. Whenever he ends up bankrupt, he wanders back into the Charles house to retell the days of the glory and fame.
:&quot;I give that piano up. That was the best thing that ever happened to me, getting rid of that piano...Now, the first three or four years of that is fun. You can&#x27;t get enough whiskey and you can&#x27;t get enough women and you don&#x27;t never get tired of playing that piano. But that only last so long. You look up one day and you hate the whiskey, and you hate the women, and you hate the piano. But that&#x27;s all you got. You can&#x27;t do nothing else. All you know how do is play the piano. Now, who am I? Am I me? Or am I the piano player?&quot;
His former days of glory emphasize the submergence of his soul in the past. Wining Boy is also the only other character, aside from Berniece, who can speak with the dead. He speaks to the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog and to his deceased wife, Cleotha.

Grace: One of the last figures to be added to the play, Grace shows the desires of both Boy Willie and Lymon. Both men attempt to be with her and play to her good graces. Since she is not a member of the Charles family, the tension she feels in the last scene of Act Two demonstrates how strong the presence of the ancestral ghosts are in the Charles household.

== Cast and characters ==
==Productions==
&quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; debuted as a staged reading at the 1986 National Playwrights Conference held at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center.

The first production opened on November 26, 1987 at the Yale Repertory Theatre. The cast featured Carl Gordon, Samuel L. Jackson, Rocky Carroll, Starletta DuPois, Chenee Johnson, Ylonda Powell, Tommy Hollis, Lou Myers, and Sharon Washington. The production was directed by Lloyd Richards and featured set design by E. David Cosier, Jr., costume design by Constanza Romero, lighting design by Christopher Akerlind, sound design by J. Scott Servheen, and musical direction by Dwight Andrews.

It then opened at the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston on January 9, 1988. Charles S. Dutton assumed Jackson&#x27;s role. &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; was subsequently performed at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. S. Epatha Merkerson and LisaGay Hamilton assumed DuPois and Washington&#x27;s roles, respectively. The production then premiered on Broadway with the same cast at the Walter Kerr Theatre on April 16, 1990.

&quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; was revived off-Broadway in 2012 in a production directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and with a cast including Chuck Cooper and Brandon J. Dirden.

A Broadway revival of the play, directed by LaTanya Richardson Jackson, began previews on September 19, 2022 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, starring Samuel L.

The production has been praised for its cast, but received some criticism for its direction.

<text>Samantha Zoe Womack (&quot;née&quot; Janus; born 2 November 1972) is an English actress, singer, model and director who has worked in film, television and stage. Womack initially planned a career in singing and she represented the United Kingdom in the 1991 Eurovision Song Contest. Her song for the contest, &quot;A Message to Your Heart&quot;, was released as her only single in April 1991 and reached number 30 in the UK Singles Chart. 

Womack made her name as a pop star, and returned to the public eye in the mid-1990s with her role as Mandy Wilkins in &quot;Game On&quot; (1995–1998), leading on to roles in the BBC One drama &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot; (1995–1996) and the sitcom &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; (1998). She has since become known for playing the role of Ronnie Mitchell in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2007–2011, 2013–2017). Her portrayal of Ronnie gained her more prominence and acting roles after some time out of the limelight. She also played Tanya Porter in Sky One comedy-drama &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot; from 2013 until the final episode in 2017. Womack has also toured across the United Kingdom playing Morticia Addams in the stage musical &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Early life==
Womack was born in Brighton. Her singer-songwriter father, Noel Janus (born Janes), left the family when she was six, and soon after, her model-actress mother, Diana O&#x27;Hanlon, married a doctor and the family moved to Edinburgh.

Womack lived on the &quot;QE2&quot; with her choreographer grandmother, Sheila Holt (a former actress and choreographer to magician David Nixon for a short time). Womack has a younger half-sister, Zoe. During an appearance on &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot; in 2014, it was revealed that she attended the same school as members of All Saints, sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton, before going to the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London, where she met future &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Danniella Westbrook. At the age of 15, as a self-confessed &quot;wild child&quot;, she left home for a life squatting, drinking, smoking and taking drugs.

Womack is the niece of Angie Best, her father&#x27;s sister and former wife of footballer George Best. Angie&#x27;s son, Calum Best, is Womack&#x27;s cousin. As revealed on an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2012, Womack&#x27;s great-great-grandmother Jessie Ryder was an actress in New York City in the early 20th century.

==Career==
===Eurovision Song Contest and early career===
The actress first came to prominence in March 1991 aged 18, when she won the annual &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; competition to represent the United Kingdom in the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;. She finished joint tenth and the song, &quot;A Message to Your Heart&quot;, peaked at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite her achievements, her &quot;Eurovision&quot; entry is frequently remarked upon. She has said regarding the experience that her failure in the contest &quot;devastated&quot; her at the time and thought it would spell the end of her career. She has also called her appearance &quot;ridiculous&quot;, in that she was dressed in a pink mini dress while singing about starving children and said the lyrics of the song are &quot;burned into her memory&quot; forever.

Womack developed her first love of acting, appearing in episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot; and &quot;Press Gang&quot;; in 1993 she appeared in &quot;Demob&quot; with Griff Rhys Jones and Martin Clunes; and took to the West End stage, replacing Debbie Gibson as Sandy in &quot;Grease.&quot;

In 1994 Womack appeared in the comedy-drama crime series &quot;Minder.&quot; She played Marian Prince, a jazz club chanteuse and friend of Ray Daley in the episode &quot;All Quiet on the West End Front&quot;.

From 1994 to 1998 Womack played Mandy in the BBC Two sitcom &quot;Game On&quot;. She remained on the show until its end in 1998. In between series of &quot;Game On&quot;, she had a part in the BBC One drama &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot; from 1995 to 1996 as Nicola Dooley, a waitress.

Womack then appeared in the pilot for &quot;The Grimleys&quot; with Jack Dee, and the film &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot; with Neil Morrissey. In 1998 she starred in the ITV1 series &quot;Liverpool 1&quot; with her future husband Mark Womack. She then returned to comedy in the sitcom &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; co-starring another Sylvia Young Theatre School student, Denise van Outen, it was critically panned despite respectable ratings, and Womack left after the first series.

In 1999, Womack starred as Cinderella in the ITV Christmas pantomime alongside Harry Hill, Alexander Armstrong, Frank Skinner, Paul Merton, Ronnie Corbett and many more.

A popular choice for photo shoots in men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;FHM&quot;, she came 21st in the FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World poll in 1998 and 41st in 1999.

===Smaller roles===
In 1990, she appeared as a guest in two episodes of the CITV comedy sitcom &quot;Spatz&quot;; Series 1 Episode 2 and 3. It is rumoured that a possible falling out may have occurred leading to her swift exit from the show after such a brief stint. This is fuelled by her reluctance to admit for many years that she was part of the show.

In 2002 she returned to TV in BBC One drama &quot;Strange&quot; and she appeared in films &quot;The Baby Juice Express&quot;, &quot;Lighthouse Hill&quot; and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Cards&quot;.

In January 2005 she narrated &quot;Jordan &amp; Peter: Laid Bare&quot; for ITV2. She later directed an anti-bullying music video for Liverpool band Just 3, entitled &quot;Stand Tall&quot;. The video starred her and Liverpool F.C. footballer Jamie Carragher. The video was heavily backed by Childline ambassador Esther Rantzen.

In 2006, Womack starred in the BBC One comedy &quot;Home Again&quot; as Ingrid, and as Miss Adelaide in the West End production of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre, initially with Patrick Swayze and then &quot;Miami Vice&quot; star Don Johnson. She reprised the role at the Sunderland Empire opposite Alex Ferns in 2007.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
On 11 May 2007 it was announced that she would be joining &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Ronnie Mitchell, a cousin of the well known Mitchell brothers. She had previously appeared in the soap in a minor role as a girlfriend of Simon Wicks, played by Nick Berry. During her first stint, Womack&#x27;s character Ronnie was central to many storylines including the controversial baby-swap story which was aired during 2011. On 6 January 2011, it was announced that she had quit the soap due to her unhappiness with the baby swap storyline. Womack made her final appearance as Ronnie on 7 July 2011 when the character was sent to prison.

Since appearing on &quot;EastEnders&quot; she has made regular television appearances on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; and &quot;Loose Women&quot;. In November 2007, she sang with &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-stars in the 2007 &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity appeal.

In May 2013, it was confirmed that Womack would return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Ronnie Mitchell. Ronnie was later killed-off during the episode broadcast on 1 January 2017, when she was trying to save her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) from drowning in a hotel swimming pool, and drowned herself. Her last “appearance” was in the episode broadcast 19 January 2017 when Ronnie was shown as a corpse lying in her coffin.

In March 2013, Womack starred opposite her husband on stage in the world premiere of &quot;Hope&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool.

From September 2013, Womack played the regular role of Tanya in series three of Sky Living&#x27;s &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;. She continued in this role until the final episode in 2017. Altogether, Womack appeared in 25 episodes as Tanya Dawson (later Porter when the character married).

In 2015, she appeared in the film &quot;&quot; as lead actor Taron Egerton&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother. This was Womack&#x27;s first main role in such a high-profile film. In 2017 Womack reprised the role in a smaller appearance in &quot;&quot;.

In 2017, Womack toured as Morticia Adams in the musical-comedy &quot;Addams Family&quot; as Morticia around the UK and Ireland. She was announced to reprise the role in 2021 for a tour around UK and Ireland, however she did not reprise the role on tour for unknown reasons. The role of Morticia Addams was instead played by Strictly Come Dancing champion Joanne Clifton

In September 2018, it was announced that she would be playing Fairy Bow Bells in the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;.

Womack appeared in &quot;Silent Witness&quot; in early 2019. On an episode of &quot;Loose Women&quot; in February 2019, Womack confirmed that offers had been made to her about a project with co-star and best friend Rita Simons. In response to this, they both said that they would wait for the right one to come along.

From 2021 to 2023, she portrayed the White Witch in the UK touring and West End productions of &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;.

===Other ventures===
In January 2011 she appeared as one of the celebrity contestants on the BBC show &quot;The Magicians&quot;, working with magician Chris Korn. For her &quot;celebrity&#x27;s choice&quot; trick, she chose being sawn in half by Korn in an illusion called Clearly Impossible. In March 2011 she appeared with Lenny Henry, Angela Rippon and Reggie Yates in the BBC fundraising documentary for Comic Relief called &quot;Famous, Rich and in the Slums&quot;, where the four celebrities were sent to Kibera in Kenya, Africa&#x27;s largest slum.

In November 2011, it was reported that Womack was in the running, alongside Dannii Minogue to become a judge on the 2012 series of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. However, it was later confirmed that the judging panel for series six would be Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams. Womack has since confirmed that she was offered a place on the judging panel and that she had a meeting with Cowell in Los Angeles. She has said that although she was grateful, she rejected the offer as &quot;it&#x27;s just not me&quot;.

In 2012 Womack appeared in series nine of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; The episode revealed her descent on her father&#x27;s side from two musicians, her great grandfather Alexander Cunningham Ryan, his partner&#x27;s father Pierre François Odilon Garraud, &amp; Pierre&#x27;s partner, an actress, Jessie Ryder.

In February 2013, she took part in &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;, donating money to Comic Relief and ActionAid.

In February 2020, it was announced that Womack would be taking part in the challenge for &quot;Sport Relief&quot;. In 2021, she acted alongside &quot;Harry Potter&quot; actress Jessie Cave in the British sitcom &quot;Buffering&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Womack won &quot;substantial&quot; damages from the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; newspaper over a story headlined &quot;Sam&#x27;s sex and drugs shame&quot;. She sued the &quot;Sport&quot; over an article published on 22 July, which claimed she had &quot;coke fuelled threesomes&quot; and took part in a &quot;three-hour drug fuelled lesbian orgy&quot;.

In September 2015, it was reported that she was &quot;living in fear&quot; and had alerted the police that she was being stalked. The stalker was given a suspended sentence in December, the same year.

===Relationships===
Janus married an Italian citizen, Junfan Mantovani, in 1997 after a long relationship. The relationship broke down and the couple divorced in 1998.

Womack began a relationship with &quot;Liverpool 1&quot; co-star Mark Womack. They married in 2009 after ten years together. The couple have two children: son Benjamin Thomas Womack (born 2001) and daughter Lili-Rose Womack (born 2005). Mark Womack also has a son, Michael Womack, from a previous marriage. In 2009, Womack took her husband&#x27;s surname and began to use it professionally. In August 2020, Womack announced that she and Mark had quietly separated in 2018, but that they are still living together in the same house with their children.

Womack and her husband Mark are best friends with Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack&#x27;s two children, and she is godmother to Maslen&#x27;s son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack&#x27;s character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister. Womack is also best friends with her former &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Rita Simons, who played her sister Roxy Mitchell.

===Health===
In April 2008, Womack broke her shoulder when she tripped and fell down the stairs at her home while rushing to get ready for work.

On 8 August 2022, in a post paying tribute to Dame Olivia Newton-John following her death from breast cancer, Womack revealed on Twitter that she had been diagnosed with the disease herself. In December 2022, Womack announced that she was now cancer free.

<doc id="1129121" wikidata="Q5882648" url="?curid=1129121" title="Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)">
<text>Hollywood Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery located at 412 South Cherry Street in the Oregon Hill neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia. It was established in 1847 and designed by the landscape architect John Notman. It is 135-acres in size and overlooks the James River. It is one of three places in the United States that contains the burials of two U.S. Presidents, the others being Arlington National Cemetery and United First Parish Church.

Due to Richmond&#x27;s role as capital of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, the cemetery contains the burials of many government officials of the confederacy including president Jefferson Davis and secretary of war James A. Seddon. Hollywood contains the burials of 25 Confederate States Army officers including generals J.E.B. Stuart, Fitzhugh Lee and George Pickett. The cemetery contains the remains of over 11,000 confederate soldiers. They are memorialized by the Monument of the Confederate War Dead, a 90-foot tall granite pyramid built in 1869. The cemetery is considered the unofficial National Confederate Cemetery and has hosted ceremonies commemorating Confederate Memorial Day since 1866. Hollywood Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.

==Description==
The cemetery is in the Oregon Hill neighborhood of Richmond. It is 135 acres in size and overlooks the James River. It is one of the most visited cemeteries in Virginia.

===Presidents Circle===
Hollywood Cemetery is the only cemetery besides Arlington National Cemetery that contains the burials of two U.S. Presidents. Although the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, contains the burial of two U.S. Presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, in a crypt below the church.

President James Monroe was originally interred in Marble Cemetery in New York City when he died in 1831. Virginia petitioned to have his remains reinterred to Hollywood Cemetery. The Gothic Revival James Monroe Tomb monument designed by Albert Lybrock resembles a bird cage surrounding a simple granite sarcophagus. It was built in the Presidents Circle section of the cemetery and dedicated by Virginia governor Henry A. Wise on July 5, 1858. The monument was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

President John Tyler was buried in the Presidents Circle section of the cemetery in 1862 and a monument was dedicated by Congress in 1915. His death was not recognized in Washington, D.C., due to his allegiance to the confederacy. His burial ceremony was escorted by Jefferson Davis and address given by Armistead C. Gordon.

Confederate president Jefferson Davis died in 1889. He was initially interred in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, and reinterred to Hollywood Cemetery in 1893. A life-size statue made of bronze sculpted by George Julian Zolnay was added near his grave.

===Monument of Confederate War Dead===

In 1869, a high granite pyramid designed by Charles H. Dimmock was built as a memorial to the more than 11,000 enlisted men of the Confederate Army buried in the cemetery. The monument is made of roughly cut James River granite blocks. The monument is inscribed with text in Latin that translates to, &quot;In eternal memory of those who stood for God and Country.&quot; It was a project supported by the Hollywood Ladies&#x27; Memorial Association, a group of Southern women dedicated to honoring and caring for the burial sites of fallen Confederate soldiers. The pyramid became a symbol of the Hollywood Memorial Association, appearing on its stationery as well as on the front of a pamphlet of buried soldiers, the &quot;Register of the Confederate Dead&quot;.

==History==
William Byrd III, a wealthy planter, politician and military officer, was facing financial problems and divided his estate in Richmond known as the Belvidere into several plots 100-acres in size for sale. The Harvie family bought several of these lots which became known as &quot;Harvie&#x27;s Woods.&quot;

In 1847, Joshua J. Fry and William H. Haxall, visited Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts. They were impressed with Mount Auburn and proposed the creation of a similar rural cemetery in Richmond. It was through their efforts and the subsequent cooperation of local citizens that Hollywood Cemetery was created.

Fry, Haxall, and 40 other prominent Richmond citizens purchased 42 acres from Lewis E. Harvie on June 3, 1847, for $4,075 to establish the cemetery. The founders hired John Notman, who was the landscape architect for Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, to design the cemetery in the rural garden style. It was originally planned to be named Mount Vernon Cemetery, however Notman proposed the name Hollywood due to the abundance of holly trees on the property. Oliver P. Baldwin delivered the dedication address in 1849.

Hollywood Cemetery became so popular, that by the mid-1850s, the city of Richmond implemented an omnibus to transport visitors there every afternoon. A streetcar line was added in the 1860s.

===American Civil War===
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, the cemetery directors set aside two acres for confederate soldier burials which became known as the Soldiers&#x27; Section. Richmond citizens became outraged when they learned that soldiers that died in local hospitals were buried in potter&#x27;s fields. In response to the outrage, the city increased the number of burials of dead soldiers at Hollywood and established Oakwood Cemetery across town for additional burials.

The initial two acres assigned for soldier burials became full by July 1862 and the cemetery purchased additional land funded by the confederate government. By April 1865, the cemetery contained more than 11,000 confederate soldiers, which accounted for more than half of the total burials in the cemetery. After the war, the Ladies&#x27; Memorial Association worked to reinter 2,935 confederate soldiers from Gettysburg to Hollywood Cemetery. Confederate Civil War veterans continued to be buried in the cemetery into the 1900s.

The cemetery claims to contain the burial of 18,000 confederate soldiers, however researchers believe the number is actually several thousand lower. It is the largest single burial location of confederate soldiers. It contains the burials of 25 Confederate Army officers including J.E.B. Stuart, Fitzhugh Lee and George Pickett. 

At George Pickett&#x27;s request, he was buried among his men in his native Richmond when he died in 1875. LaSalle “Sallie” Corbell Pickett hoped she could be buried there too. Women were not allowed to be buried in the soldiers’ section of Richmond&#x27;s Hollywood Cemetery at the time of Mrs. Pickett’s death in 1931. In 1998, for the first time a woman&#x27;s remains have ever been allowed in this area, Mrs. Pickett was reburied in the Gettysburg soldiers’ section of Hollywood Cemetery by her husband. “Mrs. Pickettt died in the early 1930s, and had wanted to be buried with her husband in the Hollywood Cemetery.  But the Hollywood Ladies Memorial Society, which then controlled the Gettysburg Hill portion of the cemetery, would not allow it.” Richmond Discovery tour guide Jim DuPriest said.” So, Mrs. Pickett was buried in Abbey Mausoleum [which was] nearby, besides, and adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery in Northern Virginia.” … “Near the end of the ceremony, the families sprinkled soil from Mrs. Pickett’s home in Chuckatuck, Nansemond County, Virginia.”

The cemetery is unofficially considered the Confederate National Cemetery.

===Confederate Memorial Day===

On May 31, 1866, Hollywood Cemetery held its first Confederate Memorial Day celebration, and over 20,000 people were in attendance. The celebrations &quot;became imbued with cultural and religious symbolism that underscored the gravity of what it meant to be a southerner.&quot;

The second Confederate Memorial Day celebration in 1867 at Hollywood Cemetery differed greatly from the one the year before. There were fewer marches and military bands and more women and children in attendance.

===Other history===
In 1876, the Gothic Revival stone structure designed to look like a ruined medieval tower was built at the entrance to house the chapel, office and receiving vault. In 1915, the original entrance was closed and the present one was opened to better facilitate cars.

The cemetery expanded in 1877 with the purchase of an additional thirty-three acres along the river.

On November 12, 1969, Hollywood Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
The Palmer Chapel Mausoleum was built 1992, adding 730 crypts for caskets and 160 cremation niches.

There are many local legends surrounding certain tombs and grave sites in the cemetery. One interesting grave of Florence Rees, a girl that died at 3 years old in 1862 of scarlet fever. The grave includes a cast-iron statue of a dog that stands watch over her. A local legend claims the statue was moved to the cemetery to prevent it from being melted down and used for bullets in the Civil War. There is also the legend of Richmond Vampire which purports that William Wortham Pool, buried in the cemetery, was a vampire.

In 2020, Hollywood Cemetery&#x27;s board of directors quietly banned the display of Confederate flags in the cemetery due to its connection as a symbol of racism and the potential to provoke vandalism.

A place rich in history, legend, and gothic landscape, Hollywood Cemetery is also frequented by many of the local students attending Virginia Commonwealth University.

<text>Countertransference, in psychotherapy, refers to a therapist&#x27;s redirection of feelings towards a patient or becoming emotionally entangled with them. This concept is central to the understanding of therapeutic dynamics in psychotherapy.

== Early 20th century ==

Countertransference (), originally described by Sigmund Freud in 1910, refers to a therapist&#x27;s unconscious feelings influenced by their patient. Freud recognized this as an ongoing challenge for therapists, stating the need for therapists to be aware and in control of these feelings. While Freud mainly saw countertransference as a personal issue for the therapist, his private correspondence indicates a deeper interest and understanding of its complexities. This concept broadened to include unconscious reactions, by the unconscious mind, shaped by the therapist&#x27;s own history, which could impede objectivity and limit therapeutic effectiveness. For example, a therapist might unconsciously want a patient to succeed due to personal connections, leading to a biased approach in therapy.

The psychoanalytic community widely acknowledged the risks associated with countertransference. Carl Jung, Eric Berne, and Jacques Lacan, among others, highlighted its potential to complicate the therapeutic relationship. This understanding encompassed not only the therapist&#x27;s unconscious responses rooted in their personal history but also their unconscious hostile or erotic feelings towards a patient.

=== Examples ===
For example, a therapist might subconsciously project their parental role onto a patient, especially if the patient is reminiscent of their own children. For instance, a therapist whose children are in university might overly empathize with a patient&#x27;s academic struggles. This bias, even when well-intentioned, can lead to what&#x27;s termed a &quot;countertransference cure.&quot; This occurs when therapy outcomes are driven more by the therapist&#x27;s needs than the patient&#x27;s, resulting in the patient conforming to the therapist&#x27;s expectations. This compliance can suppress the patients authentic feelings and needs, creating a &#x27;false self&#x27; or a facade of improvement rather than genuine progress.

In another example, the therapist might transfer unresolved personal issues onto the patient. For example, a therapist who lacked attention from their father might perceive a patient&#x27;s independent behavior as a form of rejection, an example of transference. This can lead to feelings of resentment towards the patient, a phenomenon known as the &#x27;narrow perspective&#x27; of countertransference. In this scenario, the therapist&#x27;s unresolved feelings cloud their professional judgment, potentially hindering the therapeutic process.

== Mid-20th century ==
In the 20th century, the perspectives of Carl Jung, Heinrich Racker, and Paula Heimann significantly enriched the understanding of countertransference in psychotherapy, each contributing unique insights into its role and impact. This period marked a shift from viewing countertransference merely as an interference to recognizing it as a critical part of the therapeutic process and a potential source of valuable insights.

Jung explored the idea that a therapist&#x27;s own emotional wounds and experiences contribute to their ability to empathize with and heal their patients. He famously used the metaphor of the &quot;wounded physician,&quot; suggesting that a therapist&#x27;s personal suffering and healing journey can deepen their understanding and effectiveness in treating others. According to Jung, it is precisely the therapist&#x27;s own hurt that informs and enhances their healing capabilities. This perspective implies that personal experiences, including those that are painful, can be a source of strength and insight in the therapeutic process.

Racker emphasized the dangers inherent in repressing countertransference. He warned that ignoring or denying these feelings can complicate the therapy process, making it less effective. Racker believed that the unacknowledged countertransference becomes entangled in what he called &quot;the mythology of the analytic situation,&quot; implying that it can create a false narrative or dynamic in the therapeutic relationship. His perspective suggests that acknowledging and understanding countertransference is crucial for an authentic and effective therapeutic process.

Heimann highlighted that countertransference is not just a reaction originating within the therapist, but also a response to the patient&#x27;s personality and behaviors. In her view, countertransference is an integral part of the therapeutic relationship and is, in part, shaped by the patient. This concept implies that the therapist&#x27;s feelings and reactions are not solely personal but are also influenced by the patient&#x27;s characteristics and the interaction between the two. Heimann&#x27;s approach emphasizes the interactive and co-created nature of the therapeutic relationship.

Together, these perspectives underscore the complexity of countertransference, highlighting its role as both a personal response and an interactive phenomenon within the therapeutic relationship. They also point to the importance of therapists&#x27; self-awareness and the need to integrate their experiences into their professional practice.

== Late 20th-century ==
By the late 20th century, the distinction between &#x27;personal countertransference&#x27; (related to the therapist&#x27;s issues) and &#x27;diagnostic response&#x27; (indicating something about the patient) became prominent. This era acknowledged the clinical usefulness of countertransference, underscoring the need to differentiate between reactions that provide insights into the patient&#x27;s psychology and those reflecting the therapist&#x27;s personal issues.

=== Distinction between personal and diagnostic countertransference ===
A key development was the distinction between &#x27;personal countertransference&#x27; and &#x27;diagnostic countertransference.&#x27; Personal countertransference involves the therapist&#x27;s own emotional responses and unresolved issues. In contrast, diagnostic countertransference refers to the therapist&#x27;s reactions that provide insights into the patient&#x27;s psychological state. This distinction highlights the dual nature of countertransference: it can stem from the therapist&#x27;s personal experiences or be a response to the patient&#x27;s behavior and psychological needs.

The concept of &#x27;neurotic countertransference&#x27; (or &#x27;illusory countertransference&#x27;) was also distinguished from &#x27;countertransference proper.&#x27; Neurotic countertransference is more about the therapist&#x27;s unresolved personal issues, while countertransference proper is a more balanced and clinically useful response. This differentiation has been widely accepted across various psychoanalytic schools, though some, like followers of Jacques Lacan, view countertransference as a form of resistance, potentially the most significant resistance posed by the analyst.

=== Contemporary understanding of countertransference ===
In contemporary practice, countertransference is generally seen as a phenomenon co-created by both the therapist and the patient. This view acknowledges that the patient, through transference, influences the therapist to assume roles that align with the patient&#x27;s internal world. However, the therapist&#x27;s personal history and personality traits also color these roles. Thus, countertransference becomes a complex interplay of both participants&#x27; psychologies.

Therapists are encouraged to use countertransference as a therapeutic tool. By reflecting on their responses and differentiating between their personal feelings and those elicited by the patient&#x27;s behavior, therapists can gain valuable insights into the therapeutic dynamic. This self-awareness helps in understanding the roles being played in therapy, and the meanings behind these interpersonal interactions.

However, with this understanding comes a caution: therapists must remain vigilant about the dangers of unresolved countertransference, which can disrupt the therapeutic relationship. In modern psychotherapy, transference and countertransference are often seen as inextricably linked, creating a &#x27;total situation&#x27; that defines the therapeutic encounter.

This evolved understanding underscores the importance of self-awareness and continuous self-reflection in therapeutic practice, ensuring that countertransference is managed effectively for the benefit of the therapeutic process.

== Twenty-first-century developments ==

Contemporary understanding recognizes that most countertransference reactions are a mix of personal and diagnostic aspects, requiring careful discernment. The field now views countertransference as a jointly created phenomenon between the therapist and patient, with the patient influencing the therapist to adopt roles aligned with their internal world, colored by the therapist&#x27;s personality.

== Body-centred countertransference ==

Recent research, particularly in Ireland, has explored body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. This phenomenon involves physical responses in therapists and has been linked to mirror neurons and automatic empathy. Researchers at NUI Galway and University College Dublin have developed a scale to measure these responses, shedding light on the somatic aspects of countertransference in therapeutic settings.

<doc id="1129156" wikidata="Q4919430" url="?curid=1129156" title="Twelfth root of two">
<text>The twelfth root of two or formula_1 (or equivalently formula_2) is an algebraic irrational number, approximately equal to 1.0594631. It is most important in Western music theory, where it represents the frequency ratio (musical interval) of a semitone () in twelve-tone equal temperament. This number was proposed for the first time in relationship to musical tuning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It allows measurement and comparison of different intervals (frequency ratios) as consisting of different numbers of a single interval, the equal tempered semitone (for example, a minor third is 3 semitones, a major third is 4 semitones, and perfect fifth is 7 semitones). A semitone itself is divided into 100 cents (1 cent = formula_3).

==Numerical value==
The twelfth root of two to 20 significant figures is . Fraction approximations in increasing order of accuracy include , , , , and .

==The equal-tempered chromatic scale==

A musical interval is a ratio of frequencies and the equal-tempered chromatic scale divides the octave (which has a ratio of 2:1) into twelve equal parts. Each note has a frequency that is 2 times that of the one below it.

Applying this value successively to the tones of a chromatic scale, starting from A above middle C (known as A4) with a frequency of 440 Hz, produces the following sequence of pitches:
The final A (A5: 880 Hz) is exactly twice the frequency of the lower A (A4: 440 Hz), that is, one octave higher.

===Other tuning scales===
Other tuning scales use slightly different interval ratios:
* The just or Pythagorean perfect fifth is 3/2, and the difference between the equal tempered perfect fifth and the just is a grad, the twelfth root of the Pythagorean comma (formula_4).
* The equal tempered Bohlen–Pierce scale uses the interval of the thirteenth root of three (formula_5).
* Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Studie II&quot; (1954) makes use of the twenty-fifth root of five (formula_6), a compound major third divided into 5×5 parts.
* The delta scale is based on ≈formula_7.
* The gamma scale is based on ≈formula_8.
* The beta scale is based on ≈formula_9.
* The alpha scale is based on ≈formula_10.

==Pitch adjustment==


Since the frequency ratio of a semitone is close to 106% (formula_11), increasing or decreasing the playback speed of a recording by 6% will shift the pitch up or down by about one semitone, or &quot;half-step&quot;. Upscale reel-to-reel magnetic tape recorders typically have pitch adjustments of up to ±6%, generally used to match the playback or recording pitch to other music sources having slightly different tunings (or possibly recorded on equipment that was not running at quite the right speed). Modern recording studios utilize digital pitch shifting to achieve similar results, ranging from cents up to several half-steps. Reel-to-reel adjustments also affect the tempo of the recorded sound, while digital shifting does not.

==History==

Historically this number was proposed for the first time in relationship to musical tuning in 1580 (drafted, rewritten 1610) by Simon Stevin. In 1581 Italian musician Vincenzo Galilei may be the first European to suggest twelve-tone equal temperament. The twelfth root of two was first calculated in 1584 by the Chinese mathematician and musician Zhu Zaiyu using an abacus to reach twenty four decimal places accurately, calculated circa 1605 by Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin, in 1636 by the French mathematician Marin Mersenne and in 1691 by German musician Andreas Werckmeister.

<text>This discussion of the dental amalgam controversy outlines the debate over whether dental amalgam (the mercury alloy in dental fillings) should be used. Supporters claim that it is safe, effective and long-lasting, while critics argue that amalgam is unsafe because it may cause mercury poisoning and other toxicity.

Supporters of amalgam fillings point out that it is safe, durable, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. On average, amalgam lasts twice as long as resin composites, takes less time to place, is tolerant of saliva or blood contamination during placement (unlike composites), and is often about 20–30% less expensive. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has suggested that many who claim dental amalgam is not safe are &quot;prospecting for disease&quot; and using pseudoscience to scare patients into more lucrative treatment options.

Those opposed to amalgam use suggest that modern composites are improving in strength. In addition to their claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account for as much as 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. In the United States, most dental practices are prohibited from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.

The World Health Organization recommends a global phase out of dental mercury in their 2009 report on &quot;Future Use of Materials For Dental Restorations, on the basis of aiming for a general reduction of the use of mercury in all sectors, and on the basis of environmental impacts of mercury product production.&quot;

It is the position of the FDI World Dental Federation as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide that amalgam restorations are safe and effective. Numerous other organizations have also publicly declared the safety and effectiveness of amalgam. These include the Mayo Clinic, Health Canada, Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Multiple Sclerosis Society, &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Dentistry&quot;, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; &quot;Prevention&quot;, WebMD and the International Association for Dental Research.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formerly stated that amalgam is &quot;safe for adults and children ages 6 and above&quot; but now recommends against amalgam for children, pregnant/nursing women, and other high-risk groups.

== History ==
Dental amalgam has had a long history and global impact. It was first introduced in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.

=== Further developments ===
In 1855, Dr. J. Foster Flagg, a professor of dental pathology in Philadelphia, experimented with new mixtures of amalgam. In 1861, he presented his findings to the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons and, in 1881, he published his book, &quot;Plastic and Plastic Fillings&quot;. (Amalgam fillings were often called &quot;plastic fillings&quot; at the time.) The inevitable result of this affair was that silver amalgam was proven to be &quot;an excellent filling material&quot;, and expanded dentistry&#x27;s &quot;ability to save teeth&quot;. Around the same time, John and Charles Tomes in England conducted research on the expansion and contraction of the various amalgam products. During the American Civil War, the debate on the merits of amalgam continued. In dental meetings, with now decades of use and dental research came the recognition of the importance of good technique and proper mixture on long-term success. It was argued, &quot;the fault was not in the material but in the manipulation... Some men&#x27;s amalgam is good universally, and some men&#x27;s gold is bad universally; the difference lies in the preparation of the tooth and in the plug (filling).&quot;

More controversy came in 1872, when an amalgam filling was reported as the cause of death of a Nebraska middle-aged man, resulting in a public outcry against the use of amalgam. His physicians reported that the filling caused swelling of his mouth, throat and windpipe, completely hindering respiration. Given that the involved tooth was a lower second molar, it was later considered very likely that the patient died from Ludwig&#x27;s angina, which is a type of cellulitis, rather than mercury poisoning. Another alleged case of &quot;pytalism&quot; causing headache, fever, rapid pulse, metallic taste, loss of appetite, and generalized malaise was reported in 1872 in a female patient following the insertion of eight amalgam fillings. Later, however, another dentist examined the fillings and noted they had, in a short period of time, washed away, and that upon gentle pressure the metal crumbled away. He removed all the fillings with an explorer in three minutes; and concluded poor workmanship alone could have explained the patient&#x27;s symptoms.

Alfred Stock was a German chemist who reported becoming very ill in the 1920s and traced his illness to his amalgam fillings and resulting mercury intoxication. He described his recovery after the fillings were removed and believed that amalgam fillings would come to be seen as a &quot;sin against humanity&quot;. Stock had also previously been exposed to toxic levels of mercury vapor during the course of his work, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented.

===Galvanic shock===
Oral galvanism, amalgam disease, or Galvanic shock was a term for the association of oral or systemic symptoms to either: electric currents between metal in dental restorations and electrolytes in saliva or dental pulp. Any existence of galvanic pain or association of either currents or mercury to presence of symptoms has been disproven. Beyond acute allergic reaction amalgam has not been found to be associated with any adverse effects.

Very weak currents have been measured in the mouth of those with multiple dental fillings consisting of different alloys, but there was no association between presence of current and symptoms, and any symptoms associated with currents between oral fillings are likely to be psychosomatic in nature. No association between presence of mercury and symptoms have been found, with symptoms likely to be psychosomatic in nature and do not improve with chelation therapy. Claims of causing a variety of symptoms such as oral discomfort, skin irritation, headaches and a metallic taste in the mouth have been discredited. 

The condition was originally proposed in 1878, and became well known in Sweden during the 1970s and 80s, because of a campaign to educate about and replace oral amalgam fillings with mercury with other compounds such as ceramic or polymer restorations.

=== 1990s to present ===
In the 1990s, several governments evaluated the effects of dental amalgam and concluded that the most likely health effects would be due to hypersensitivity or allergy. Germany, Austria, and Canada recommended against placing amalgam in certain individuals such as pregnant women, children, those with renal dysfunction, and those with an allergy to metals. In 2004, the Life Sciences Research Office analyzed studies related to dental amalgam published after 1996 and concluded that mean urinary mercury concentration (μg of Hg/L in urine, HgU) was the most reliable estimate of mercury exposure. It found that those with dental amalgam were unlikely to reach the levels where adverse effects are seen from occupational exposure (35 μg HgU). Some 95% of study participants had μg HgU below 4–5. Chewing gum, particularly for nicotine, along with more amalgam, seemed to pose the greatest risk of increasing exposure. One gum-chewer had 24.8 μg HgU. Studies have shown that the amount of mercury released during normal chewing is extremely low. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to support or refute many of the other claims such as increased risk of autoimmune disorders, but stated that the broad and nonspecific illness attributed to dental amalgam is not supported by the data. Mutter in Germany, however, concludes, &quot;removal of dental amalgam leads to permanent improvement of various chronic complaints in a relevant number of patients in various trials.&quot;

Hal Huggins, a Colorado dentist (previous to having his license revoked), was a notable critic of dental amalgams and other dental therapies he believed to be harmful. His views on amalgam toxicity were featured on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and he was later criticized as a dentist, &quot;prospecting for disease&quot; and having only an &quot;aura of science&quot; by &quot;Consumer Reports.&quot; In 1996, a Colorado state judge recommended that Huggins&#x27;s dental license be revoked, for tricking chronically ill patients into thinking that the true cause of their illness was mercury. &quot;Time&quot; reported the judge&#x27;s conclusion that Huggins, &quot;diagnosed &#x27;mercury toxicity&#x27; in all his patients, including some without amalgam fillings.&quot; Huggins&#x27;s license was subsequently revoked by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners for gross negligence and the use of unnecessary and unproven procedures.

== Mercury exposure ==
According to the WHO, all humans are exposed to some level of mercury. Factors that determine whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually discussed in terms of the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.

The greatest degree of mercury exposure occurs during filling placement and removal. However, this is not the only time mercury vapors are released. When chewing for extended periods of time (more than 30 minutes) an increased level of mercury vapor is released. Vapor levels will return to normal approximately 90 minutes following chewing cessation. This contributes to a daily mercury exposure for those with amalgam filling.

According to one dental textbook, eating seafood once a week raises urine mercury levels to 5 to 20 μg/L, which is equivalent to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam fillings. Neither exposure has any known health effect. Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts. Estimates range from 1 to 3 micrograms (μg) per day according to the FDA. The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed.

Newer studies sometimes use mercury vapor analysis instead of the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has reported that this is not an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, it is important to note that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury.

A study conducted by measuring the intraoral vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 μg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 μg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 μg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 μg/day in the workplace. Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).

A test that was done throughout the 1980s by some opposition groups and holistic dentists was the skin patch test for mercury allergies. As part of &quot;prospecting for disease&quot;, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; wrote that these groups had placed high doses of mercuric chloride on a skin patch which was guaranteed to produce irritation on the patient&#x27;s skin and subsequent revenue for the person administering the test.

The current recommendations for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1 μg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2 μg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is an estimate of the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2 μg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4 μg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.

A 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the WHO concluded that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings and that dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury. Estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations range from 1 to 12.5 μg/day, with the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5 μg mercury/day. They also note that this will continue to decline as the number of amalgam restorations is declining.

== Health research ==
As public pressure demands more research on amalgam safety, an increasing number of studies with larger sample sizes are being conducted. Those who are not opposed to amalgam claim that, aside from rare and localized tissue irritation, recent evidence-based research has continued to demonstrate no ill effects from the minute amounts of mercury exposure from amalgam fillings. A 2004 systematic review conducted by the Life Sciences Research Office, whose clients include the FDA and NIH, concluded, &quot;the current data are insufficient to support an association between mercury release from dental amalgam and the various complaints that have been attributed to this restoration material.&quot; A systematic review in 2009 demonstrated that mercury released from amalgam restorations does not give rise to toxic effects on the nervous system of children. In 2014, a Cochrane Systematic review found &quot;insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects associated with amalgam or composite restorations.&quot;

Those opposed to dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam may lead to nephrotoxicity, neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity, oxidative stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, calcium-building in the kidneys, kidney stones, thyroid issues, and multiple sclerosis.

=== Autoimmune disorders ===
Both those opposed and those not opposed to dental amalgam recognize that amalgam has been found to be a rare contributor to localized and temporary tissue irritation known as oral lichenoid lesions. These mild, lichenoid reactions have also been reported in composite resin fillings. Those opposed to amalgam believe that amalgam fillings are also associated with increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, thyroiditis, and eczema.

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; considered these alleged associations between amalgam and chronic disease made by some health practitioners as &quot;prospecting for diseases&quot;. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) similarly has stated, &quot;There is no scientific evidence to connect the development or worsening of MS with dental fillings containing mercury, and therefore no reason to have those fillings removed. Although poisoning with heavy metals-such as mercury, lead, or manganese can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms such as tremor and weakness, the damage is inflicted in a different way than occurs in MS and the process is also different.&quot; The Lupus Foundation of America also states on their website, &quot;At the present time, we do not have any scientific data that indicates that dental fillings may act as a trigger of lupus. In fact, it is highly unlikely that dental fillings aggravate or cause SLE.&quot;

=== Dental staff impact ===
In 2006, a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the research on amalgam and its potential health effects on dentists and dental staff. It was reported that there is currently no conclusive epidemiological evidence regarding risks for adverse reproductive outcomes associated with mercury and dental professionals. It is mentioned that evidence to date fails to account for all confounding variables (such as alcohol consumption) and recommends more comprehensive and rigorous studies to adequately assess the hazards faced by dental personnel.

=== Removal of amalgam ===
The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology still claim that mercury from amalgams does not cause illness because &quot;the amount of mercury that they release is not enough to cause a health problem&quot;. In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of fillings is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the fillings in place. These societies also claim that removal of amalgam fillings, in addition to being unnecessary health care and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving them in place, is also expensive.

Dentists who advocate removal of amalgam fillings often recommend wearing breathing apparatus, using high-volume aspiration, and performing the procedure as quickly as possible. Sources of mercury from the diet, and the potential harm of the composite resins to replace the purportedly harmful amalgam fillings, may also need to be considered.

=== Alternative materials ===
Alternative materials which may be suitable in some situations include composite resins, glass ionomer cements, porcelain and gold alloys.
Most of these materials, with the notable exception of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of composite resin, and at least one school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001. This is largely a response to consumer pressure for white fillings for cosmetic reasons, and also because of the increasing longevity of modern resin composites. These alternative dental restorative materials are not free of potential health risks, such as allergenicity, inhalation of resin dust, cytotoxicity, and retinal damage from blue curing light.

=== Chelation therapy ===
Anti-amalgam sources typically promote removal of amalgam fillings and substitution with other materials. Detoxification may also be advised, including fasting, restricted dieting to avoid mercury containing foods, and quasi-chelation therapies, allegedly to remove accumulated mercury from the body. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology recommend against chelation therapy and say that chelation therapy can artificially and temporarily elevate the levels of heavy metals in the urine (a practice referred to as &quot;provoked&quot; urine testing). They also mention that the chelating drugs may have significant side effects, including dehydration, hypocalcemia, kidney injury, liver enzyme elevations, hypotension, allergic reactions, and mineral deficiencies.

=== Epidemiology ===
Better dental health overall coupled with increased demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, have resulted in a steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world&#x27;s oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.

=== Prenatal ===
There is little evidence to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted to determine the effects of dental amalgam on fetuses in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A larger study, consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy.

=== Public awareness ===
A 2006 Zogby International poll of 2,590 US adults found that 72% of respondents were not aware that mercury was a main component of dental amalgam and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in dental amalgam before receiving it as a filling. A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems. Some dentists (including a member of the FDA&#x27;s Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to inform patients that amalgam contains mercury.

A prominent debate occurred in the late 20th century, with consumer and regulatory pressure to eliminate amalgam being &quot;at an all-time high&quot;. In a 2006 nationwide poll, 76% of Americans were unaware that mercury is the primary component in amalgam fillings, and this lack of informed consent was the most consistent issue raised in a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on the issue by panel members.

The broad lack of knowledge that existed among the public was also displayed when a December 1990 episode of the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; covered mercury in amalgam. This resulted in a nationwide amalgam scare and additional research into mercury release from amalgam. The following month &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; published an article criticizing the content of the broadcast, stating that it contained a great deal of false information and that the ADA spokesperson on the program was ill-prepared to defend the claims. For example, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported that Germany was planning to pass legislation within the year to ban amalgam, but the institute of German Dentists said one month later that there was no such law pending. Also, one physiologist interviewed by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; noted that the testimonials are mostly anecdotal, and both the reported symptoms and the rapid recovery time after the fillings are removed are physiologically inconsistent with that of mercury poisoning. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; goes on to criticize how &quot;60 Minutes&quot; failed to interview the many patients who had fillings or teeth removed only to have the symptoms stay the same or get worse.

In 1991, the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded, &quot;none of the data presented show a direct hazard to humans from dental amalgams.&quot; In 2002, a class action lawsuit was initiated by patients who felt their amalgam fillings caused them harm. The lawsuit named the ADA, the New York Dental Association, and the Fifth District Dental Society for deceiving &quot;[the] public about health risks allegedly associated with dental amalgam.&quot; On 18 February 2003, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the two amalgam-related lawsuits against organized dentistry, stating the plaintiffs had &quot;failed to show a &#x27;cognizable cause of action&#x27;&quot;.

=== Research directions ===
The proper interpretation of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although the vast majority of patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in top 0.1%) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety. Two recent randomized clinical trials in children discovered no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable. However, the other study (published in &quot;JAMA&quot;) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, &quot;during follow-up [blood mercury levels were] 1.0 to 1.5 μg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group.&quot; EPA considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states, &quot;exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages.&quot; Currently, EPA has set the &quot;safe&quot; mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 μg of mercury per one liter of blood. While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above &quot;safe&quot; levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.

==Environmental impact==

Environmental concerns over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. In the United States, several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.

The WHO reported in 2005 that in the United Kingdom mercury from amalgam accounted for 5% of total mercury emissions. In Canada, dental amalgam was estimated to contribute one-third of the mercury in sewer system waste, but it is believed amalgam separators in dental offices may dramatically decrease this burden on the public sewer system.

The 2005 WHO report stated that mercury from amalgam was approximately 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that one-third of the total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown this to be a gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries &quot;accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent&quot;. Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment and the vast majority of the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.

Cremation of bodies containing amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, as the temperature in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated carbon adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, it is estimated that globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.

== Organizational statements ==
=== American Dental Association (ADA) ===
The American Dental Association (ADA) has asserted that dental amalgam is safe and has held, &quot;the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical&quot;. Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA&#x27;s Dental Products Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam. ADA states, &quot;dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed.&quot; The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing information and assistance to its members in implementation of amalgam separators. The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam. Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population.

=== Dental Material Commission ===
In 2002, Dr. Maths Berlin of The Dental Material Commission published an overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997 and 2002 for the Swedish Government on amalgam and its possible environmental and health risks. A final report was submitted to the Swedish Government in 2003 and included his report as an annex to the full report. In the final report from 2003, Berlin states that the 1997 summary had found &quot;... no known epidemiological population study has demonstrated any adverse health effects in amalgam&quot;. He reports that researchers have been able to show effects of mercury at lower concentrations than before and states, &quot;... the safety margin that it was thought existed with respect to mercury exposure from amalgam has been erased.&quot; He recommends eliminating amalgam in dentistry for medical and environmental reasons as soon as possible.

=== Food and Drug Administration ===
After FDA&#x27;s deliberations and review of hundreds of scientific studies relating to the safety of dental amalgam, the FDA concluded, &quot;clinical studies have not established a causal link between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in adults and children age six and older.&quot; The FDA concluded that individuals age six and older are not at risk of mercury-associated health effects from mercury vapor exposure that come from dental amalgam.

In 2009, the FDA issued a final rule which classified dental amalgam as a &quot;Class II&quot; (moderate risk) device, placing it in the same category as composite resins and gold fillings. In a press release announcing the reclassification, the agency again stated, &quot;the levels [of mercury] released by dental amalgam fillings are not high enough to cause harm in patients.&quot;

Also, in the FDA final regulation on dental amalgam in 2009, the FDA recommended the product labeling of dental amalgam. The suggested labeling included: a warning against the use of dental amalgam in patients with mercury allergy, a warning that dental professionals use appropriate ventilation when handling dental amalgam, and a statement discussion of scientific evidence on dental amalgam&#x27;s risks and benefits in order to make informed decisions amongst patient and professional dentists.

In 2020, the FDA updated their guidelines to recommend against amalgam for certain high-risk groups, including children, pregnant and nursing women, people with neurological disease, impaired kidney function, and known sensitivity to mercury, due to potential harmful health effects of mercury vapor. They acknowledge that breathing in mercury vapor may be harmful to certain populations, but recommend against removal of amalgam fillings unless medically necessary.

== Regulation ==
The use of mercury in dental fillings is considered safe and effective in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced legislation to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam is part of a larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, thermometers, light bulbs, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations &quot;Minamata Convention on Mercury&quot;. Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices, which were banned as of the year 2020, the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).

=== International groups ===
FDI World Dental Federation recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. FDI is a federation of approximately 200 national dental associations and dental specialist groups representing over 1.5 million dentists. In collaboration with the WHO, they have produced an FDI position statement and WHO consensus statement on dental amalgam. Their position regarding the safety of dental amalgam is that, aside from rare allergic reactions and local side effects, &quot;the small amount of mercury released from amalgam restorations, especially during placement and removal, has not been shown to cause any other adverse health effects.&quot; The paper goes on to say that there have been &quot;no controlled studies published that show adverse systemic effects&quot; from amalgam restorations and there is no evidence that removing amalgam restorations relieves any general symptoms. More recently, FDI has published a resolution confirming that their position on the safety and effectiveness of amalgam has not changed despite the phasing-down in some countries.

=== North America ===
In the United States, numerous respected professional and non-profit organizations consider amalgam use to be safe and effective and have publicly declared such. In addition to the American Dental Association, other American organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; and WebMD have all given formal, public statements declaring that amalgam fillings are safe based on the best scientific evidence.

On 28 July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recategorized amalgam as a class II medical device, which critics claim indicates a change in their perception of safety. The ADA has indicated that this new regulation actually places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials, including composite and gold fillings.

Despite the research regarding the safety of amalgam fillings, the state of California requires warning information given to patients for legal reasons (informed consent) as part of Proposition 65. This warning also applied to resin fillings for a time, since they contain bisphenol A (BPA) a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity at high doses.

In Canada, amalgam use is considered safe and effective by some groups. A 2005 position statement from the Canadian Dental Association (CDA) states &quot;current scientific evidence on the use of dental amalgam supports that amalgam is an effective and safe filling material that provides a long-lasting solution for a broad range of clinical situations. The CDA has established its position based on the current consensus of scientific and clinical experts and on recent extensive reviews of strong evidence by major North American and international organizations, which have satisfactorily countered any safety concerns.&quot; Amalgam use is regulated by Health Canada as are all medical treatments and Health Canada has also stated that dental amalgam is not causing illness in the general population.

=== Australia ===
Australia recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. In 2012, the Australian Dental Association published a position paper on the safety of dental amalgam. Their position is &quot;Dental Amalgam has been used as a dental restorative material for more than 150 years. It has proved to be a durable, safe and effective material which has been the subject of extensive research over this time&quot; and &quot;amalgam should continue to be available as a dental restorative material&quot;.

=== Europe ===
Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) is a scientific committee within the European Commission. In a 2008 document of 74 pages, its research on the subject of amalgam safety concluded &quot;there is no scientific evidence for risks of adverse systemic effects exist [&quot;sic&quot;] and the current use of dental amalgam does not pose a risk of systemic disease.&quot;

England and Scotland recognize the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A policy statement from the British Dental Health Foundation states that they do not consider amalgams containing mercury a significant health risk.

Ireland recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. The Irish Dental Association has published on their website: &quot;Dental amalgam has been used on patients for over 150 years. All available world-wide research indicates that amalgam is not harmful to health... No Government or reputable scientific, medical or dental body anywhere in the world accepts, on any published evidence, that dental amalgam is a hazard to health.&quot; The Irish Dental Association provides additional detail in a published patient information letter.

France has publicly recognized the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A position paper on the Association Dentaire Française website states that amalgam restorations have proven to have no biological or toxic effect. They also mention that no serious pathological fact has ever been observed and no general toxic action has been scientifically proven to date. The most exposed subjects remain dentists in whom it did not identify occupational diseases related to mercury and other rare that any allergies. These amalgam allergies are about 40 times less than that of resin fillings

During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, there was considerable and intense public debate on the use of dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.

In 1991, organized through the ministry of the environment, Norway began phasing out the use of most mercury-containing products (not limited to amalgam fillings but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc.). The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008. The Norwegian officials stressed that this is not a decision based on using an unsafe health product, but rather that the &quot;overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment&quot;. Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis.

Similar to Norway, from 1995 to 2009 the Environment Ministry of the Government of Sweden gradually banned the import and use of all mercury-based products (not limited to amalgam fillings alone, but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, lightbulbs, analytical chemicals, cosmetics, etc.). These mercury-based products were phased out for environmental reasons and precautionary health reasons. Like Norway, there was considerable public pressure in the years leading up to the ban. Since the ban, the Government of Sweden continued to investigate ways of reducing mercury pollution. The Swedish Chemicals Agency state that they may grant exemptions on the use of amalgam on a case-by-case basis.

Following the Minamata Convention on Mercury, from July 2018 onwards, the EU Mercury Regulation prohibits the use of dental amalgam in children under 15 years old and pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Additional requirements include the use of pre-encapsulated mercury and ethical disposal of waste amalgam. The British Dental Association has worked with the Council of European Dentists to prevent an immediate ban of amalgam until further research into practicalities has been undertaken, which is currently ongoing. The European Commission will report to European Parliament by June 2020, and to the European Council by 2030 regarding the viability of ending dental amalgam use by 2030.

=== Japan===
In Japan, the use of amalgam began to decline around the 1990s; since 2016, fillings with amalgam alloys have been excluded from insurance coverage. Amalgam is still allowed as of 2023, but is rarely used because it is very expensive. Dental composite and palladium alloys are used instead.

<text>Emperor Renzong of Song (30 May 1010 – 30 April 1063), personal name Zhao Zhen, was the fourth emperor of the Northern Song dynasty of China. He reigned for about 41 years from 1022 to his death in 1063, making him the longest reigning Song dynasty emperor. He was the sixth son of his predecessor, Emperor Zhenzong, and was succeeded by his cousin&#x27;s son, Zhao Shu who took the throne as Emperor Yingzong because his own sons died prematurely.

Emperor Renzong&#x27;s father Emperor Zhenzong died in 1022 leaving the 12 year-old Renzong as the new emperor. His adoptive mother Empress Liu acted as the regent before Renzong reached majority. By 1027, Renzong was old enough to rule on his own but Liu refused to step down and ruled until her death in 1033.

==Reign==
Compared to other renowned Chinese emperors, Emperor Renzong is less well-known. His reign represented the zenith of the Song Dynasty&#x27;s influence and power, yet it also marked the onset of a gradual decline that would continue for over one and a half centuries. A contributing factor to this decline was potentially the dynasty&#x27;s foreign policy during his tenure.

=== Foreign Policy and Relations ===
The official policy of the Song Empire at the time was of pacifism and this caused the weakening of its military. The Tangut-led Western Xia state took advantage of this deterioration and waged small scale wars against the Song Empire near the borders.

In 1038, the Tangut chieftain Li Yuanhao named himself emperor of Da Xia and demanded Emperor Renzong recognise him as an equal. The Song court recognised Li Yuanhao as governor but not as &quot;emperor&quot;, a title it regarded as exclusive to the Song emperor. After intense diplomatic contacts, in 1043 the Tangut state accepted the recognition of the Song emperor as emperor in exchange for annual gifts, which implied tacit recognition on the part of the Song of the military power of the Tanguts.

When Emperor Renzong came to power, he issued decrees to strengthen the military and paid massive bribes to the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, an adversary of Western Xia, in the hope that this would ensure the safety of the Song Empire. However, these policies involved a heavy price. Taxes were increased severely and the peasants lived in a state of perpetual poverty. This eventually caused organized rebellions to take place throughout the country and the breakdown of the Song government, including that of Nong Zhigao.

=== Political and Economic Reform ===
Renzong is known for his reform attempt known as the Qingli Reforms (庆历新政, Qingli Xinzheng), initiated around 1040–1045, represented a significant reform movement aimed at strengthening the government and improving administrative efficiency. Advocated by the statesman Fan Zhongyan, Fu Bi, Han Qi, and Ouyang Xiu, the reforms were aimed to strengthen agricultural production, reclaim lands, reduce sub-official level administrative units, and more importantly, enhance national defense by organizing local militias and reduce military expenditures. While these policies were progressive and intended to address systemic issues, they encountered resistance from conservative factions within the government and were eventually rescinded following Fan Zhongyan&#x27;s resignation from office. Despite their brief implementation, the Qingli Reforms are regarded as a precursor to later, more extensive reforms in the Song Dynasty and hold an important place in Chinese historical studies.

=== Cultural Achievements ===
During the reign of Emperor Renzong, the Song Dynasty experienced a significant cultural and literary flourishing. This period saw the emergence of some of the most esteemed literati in Chinese history. Figures such as Yan Shu, Fan Zhongyan, Ouyang Xiu and Mei Yaochen all lived through this era and commenced or developed their literary careers during Renzong&#x27;s reign.

A landmark event in 1057, under Renzong&#x27;s rule, was the Imperial Examination, which admitted several candidates destined to achieve nationwide acclaim. Among the candidates were Zeng Gong, Su Shi, and Su Zhe, accompanied by their father Su Xun. These scholars would later be recognized as some of the most influential literati in Chinese history.

Emperor Renzong elevated the 46th-generation descendants of Confucius to the current title of Duke Yansheng. They were previously of lower noble ranks.

=== Science and Technology ===
During the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063), China experienced notable advancements in science and technology. This period is marked by significant progress in areas such as astronomy, printing technology, agriculture, engineering, and military technology. Astronomical studies led to improvements in the calendar system and the construction of advanced observatories. Agricultural productivity was enhanced through the introduction of new tools and techniques, including the iron plow and the dragon backbone pump. In terms of engineering, the period saw the development of sophisticated construction techniques used in large-scale projects like bridges and dams.

The era witnessed a revolution in printing with the invention of movable type by Bi Sheng around 1040. The Song Dynasty is also credited with the first recorded use of gunpowder in warfare, marking a significant development in military technology during Renzong&#x27;s reign.

In 1054 during his reign, Chinese astronomers recorded the explosion of SN 1054, a supernova.

=== Death and Succession ===
In 1055, Emperor Renzong became critically ill and started to worry about having no successor because his sons all died prematurely. Acting on the advice of his ministers, Emperor Renzong agreed to bring two of his younger male relatives into his palace. One of them was his nephew Zhao Zongshi, the future Emperor Yingzong, who was eventually chosen and designated as the Crown Prince.

Renzong died in 1063 and was succeeded by Emperor Yingzong. The nation mourned his death, from the new Emperor to the ordinaries. Across the northern border, Emperor Daozong of Liao and his people were also found lamenting in tears, as the two countries enjoyed a relatively peaceful period spanning 42 years during Renzong&#x27;s reign.

=== Legacy ===
In the book &quot;History of Song&quot; compiled by historians of the Yuan Dynasty, Renzong is portrayed a merciful, tolerant, modest, lenient, and frugal emperor known for restraining his personal sentiments in service to the throne. As recorded in the book, Emperor Renzong worked late one night and found himself craving mutton. However, just as a servant was about to instruct the cooks to prepare the dish, Renzong intervened. He expressed concern that ordering mutton might lead to excess and wastefulness as the cooks may start to prepare it regularly. Choosing to endure his hunger rather than risk unnecessary waste, he displayed a commitment to frugality and thoughtful governance. On another account, Renzong ordered that officers of government must be very cautious in using the death penalty, and if an officer wrongly sentenced an innocent person to death even once, he would never be promoted. Renzong once remarked to his ministers: &quot;I have never used the word &#x27;death&#x27; to scold others, how dare I abuse the death penalty?&quot;

Su Shi remarked about peace and good government during Renzong&#x27;s period in Song history: “For more than seventy years the Song dynasty has flourished without people knowing the perils of war, but enjoying the blessings of affluence and education.” Song Dynasty Confucian scholar Fan Zuyu also praised Emperor Renzong for his good government, which, he claimed, grew out of the five traditional virtues that distinguished the “benevolent emperor” from all other rulers: “Emperor Renzong feared Heaven, he loved his people, he sacrificed to his ancestors, he was fond of learning, and he obeyed admonitions. Practicing these five virtues is what is called ‘being benevolent.

<text>Carmunnock (; ) is a conservation village situated within the Glasgow City council area, lying within of East Kilbride and Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire and Busby in East Renfrewshire. The nearest other district within Glasgow is Castlemilk. 

This ancient settlement which is associated with the early Christian missionary Saint Cadoc, has a medieval street plan set within the lands of an estate held by variously the Morays of Bothwell, the Earls of Douglas and eventually to the Lords, Marquesses and Dukes of Hamilton until 1700 when it passed to the Stuarts of Castlemilk.

The village is a popular residential area. The village has its own primary school (Carmunnock Primary School) with around 178 pupils. There is also a newsagent/village shop.

The village hosts its own Highland Games.

==Religion==
The only religious body in Carmunnock is the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Carmunnock Parish Church on Kirk Road, which is also known as &#x27;The Kirk in the Braes&#x27;. The original church was built on site of the current Church around 800 years, with the current building being built in 1767 in the Civil Parish of Carmunnock. The church features external stone staircases to three galleries within the sanctuary and contains examples of stained glass by Norman Macleod MacDougall.

The church is surrounded by the old village graveyard which includes a watch-house with original instructions for grave watchers of 1828, when grave robbing was a problem. Within the structure of the church is a vault where some members of the Stirling-Stewart family, the Lairds of Castlemilk, are buried.

==Transport==
The village&#x27;s only public transport links are the number 31 bus service operated by First Glasgow to Glasgow City Centre and the 31B bus service to East Kilbride, operated by JMB Travel. The nearest train station is at Busby, which is on the East Kilbride to Glasgow line.

The main route through the village is the B759 which runs from Busby, East Renfrewshire to Cambuslang.

==Etymology==
Carmunnock is of Brythonic origin, from Celtic &quot;caer&quot; &quot;fort&quot; with an unknown second element. The name was recorded as &quot;Cerminok&quot; in 1183. &quot;Mynach&quot; in modern Welsh means &quot;monk&quot;.

<doc id="1129179" wikidata="Q5016493" url="?curid=1129179" title="Cadillac V16 engine">
<text>The Cadillac V16 engine is a term that applies to two different Cadillac-designed V-16 automobile engines, an overhead valve 45-degree model produced between 1930 and 1937, and a 135-degree side valve between 1938 and 1940. Both were used in its most luxurious model line, the Cadillac V-16.

Cadillac produced two of only four production gasoline-fueled V16 engines in history. The company has twice since attempted to build a new V16 engine, once in the 1980s and again in 2003 (the Cadillac Sixteen), neither making it into production.

==Series 452==

With its chief competitor, Packard, already having sold a V12 engine against Cadillac&#x27;s eight-cylinder cars, work began late in the 1920s under Hemmings to produce a car of real impact. Lawrence Fisher, Cadillac General Manager, leaked to the press that the company would also build a V12, hoping to keep the real engine secret.

The original Cadillac V16 could be said to be two overhead valve Buick Straight-8 engine engines on a common crankshaft and crankcase, because each bank operated entirely independently of the other with no other shared components. It sported a narrow 45° bank angle for use in the new Cadillac chassis Cadillac Series 90 V-16 (which became the Fleetwood). The engine was well engineered, with a counterweighted crankshaft (quite a mathematical challenge at the time), overhead valves, and hydraulic tappets. It also had only two single barrel updraft Stromberg carburetors, one for each bank.

The V16 had a bore and a stroke, giving an engine displacement of and occasional reference as the Series 452 engine. Cadillac initially rated the engine at . It was capable of propelling the heavier models to speeds in excess of , and for some of the lighter.

In all, 3878 Series 452s were built.

This engine was used in the various V-16 models:
* 1930–1934 Series 452 (&quot;A&quot; through &quot;C&quot;)
* 1935 Series 60
* 1936–1937 Series 90

==Series 90==
The second generation of V16 was known as the Series 90, as was the 1938-1940 Series 90 cars that used them. A sidevalve design, it used an unusually wide vee-angle of 135°, giving a wide but much lower engine to suit the ever-lowering automobile styling. The two carburetors, one on each bank, and air cleaners were mounted on top of the engine block. Bore and stroke were &quot;square&quot;, both being , giving an overall displacement of . Power was rated at , 20 more than the series 468 engine. 

The &quot;series 431&quot; 1938-40 Cadillac V16 was one of the last new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era&#x27;s typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of the more advanced overhead valve design. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is &quot;The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine,&quot; by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal &quot;Automotive Industries,&quot; November 27, 1937.

==V12==
Cadillac also built a Series 452 engine-derived V12 between 1930 and 1937. It was functionally the V-16, less four cylinders. It retained the V-16&#x27;s stroke, but was bored out to , giving it a displacement of . Output was rated at with two carburetors. As with the V-16s, Cadillac V-12 cars were designed to make a statement, so all engine wiring and plumbing was hidden from view.

The V12 was used in the Fleetwood-bodied V-12 models:
* 1930–1935 Series 370 (&quot;A&quot; through &quot;E&quot;)
* 1936–1937 Series 80/85

==Later developments==
The Cadillac Sixteen concept debuted in 2003 utilized an all-aluminium pushrod V16 engine based on the same architecture as GM&#x27;s then-current small-block V8 developments. A production version with a base V8 and the option of the V12 engine was planned, but was never approved for production and was ultimately shelved around 2008.

<text>Leonardo Nascimento de Araújo (born 5 September 1969), known as Leonardo Araújo or simply Leonardo, is a Brazilian football executive and former player and manager. He last served as the sporting director of Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain until May 2022.

A versatile player, Leonardo was employed in several positions throughout his career, including as an attacking midfielder, left winger, and left-back; his best-known and most successful period was at AC Milan, in the role of attacking midfielder (or &quot;trequartista&quot;) behind the forwards. He played for teams in Brazil, Spain, Japan, France and Italy, winning titles with Flamengo, São Paulo, Kashima Antlers and Milan.

A former Brazil international, Leonardo played in the 1994 World Cup winning side, as well as the team that finished runners-up in the 1998 edition of the tournament. He also represented his nation in two Copa América tournaments, reaching the final in 1995, and winning the title in 1997, also claiming the FIFA Confederations Cup in the same year.

Following his retirement, Leonardo also served as a coach for Italian side Milan, and successively as coach of crosstown rivals Inter Milan, where he won a Coppa Italia title in 2011. From 2011 to 2013, he was sporting director of his former club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). He coached Antalyaspor in 2017 before returning to Milan as sporting director in 2018. In 2019, Leonardo returned to PSG as sporting director, until he was sacked in 2022.

==Early and personal life==
Leonardo was born and raised in Niterói, Brazil.

Divorced from his first wife with whom he had three children (one boy, two girls), he is married to Sky Italia presenter Anna Billó, with whom he has two sons.

==Club career==
Leonardo began his career with the Brazilian club Flamengo in 1987; at just 17, he was given the opportunity to play with his hero Zico plus Leandro, Bebeto and Renato Gaúcho, and to take part in winning his first Brazilian championship. In 1990, Leonardo signed with São Paulo, and in 1991, Leonardo, Raí, and other young talents were assembled as part of the so-called &#x27;esquadrão tricolor&#x27; (&quot;three-coloured squad&quot;) under the command of Brazilian legend Telê Santana, giving Leonardo his second Brazilian championship.

Later that year, he made the switch to European football, signing with the Spanish club Valencia. After two seasons with Valencia, he returned to Brazil for a brief stint with São Paulo in 1993, during which time the team won several titles, including the prestigious Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup.

In 1994, after the World Cup, Leonardo signed with the Kashima Antlers of the newly formed Japanese J1 League. Leonardo continued his success in Kashima, again playing with his idol and friend Zico. In 1996, he returned to Europe, this time signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where he again proved to be successful, one of his goals helping them to oust Liverpool out of the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

At this point in his career, Leonardo had mostly stopped playing as a left-back and moved into the midfield, sometimes on the left flank, as a winger and sometimes in the centre, as an advanced playmaker, or as a supporting striker, due to his technical skills, vision and tactical intelligence. Already in Japan, this had resulted in some spectacular goals for Leonardo, a trend which continued in Europe.

In the summer of 1997, he signed with Italian team AC Milan for €8.5 million from PSG. With Milan, he became a prominent part of a star-studded lineup on the left wing. He played four full seasons with the club, winning the 1998–99 Serie A title, in which he played a key role with his prolific performances, scoring 12 goals. In total, he scored 22 goals in 177 games for Milan, before returning to Brazil with São Paulo and Flamengo. He later returned to Milan and finished his career with the team in 2003, winning the 2002–03 Coppa Italia title.

==International career==
Leonardo was part of the Brazil under-20 team that placed third in the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his full international debut for Brazil in 1990. He was selected as a left-back for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, keeping the young Roberto Carlos out of the team, much to the latter&#x27;s chagrin. Leonardo played well in the first group games but was then given a four-match suspension for elbowing the American midfielder Tab Ramos in the head in the round of 16, causing a skull fracture that hospitalized him for three and a half months. Leonardo&#x27;s suspension prevented him from participating in the remainder of the competition. At the time, it was the second longest ban imposed in World Cup history, after Italian defender Mauro Tassotti&#x27;s eight-game suspension for breaking the nose of Spaniard Luis Enrique in the quarter-final at the same tournament. The record was broken when Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez was banned for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in his team&#x27;s final group match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Brazil went on to win the title, defeating Italy on penalties in the final after a 0–0 draw.

In 1995, he took part in the Copa América with Brazil, where the team reached the final, scoring one goal in 3–0 win over Colombia in the team&#x27;s final group match; Leonardo did not feature in the final, however, in which Brazil lost out to hosts Uruguay 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

In 1997, Leonardo was given the number 10 shirt for the national team. He was an important member of the team that won the Copa América in 1997, starting in the 3–1 victory over hosts Bolivia in the final; he also won the FIFA Confederations Cup later that year, but was an unused substitute in the 6–0 final victory over Australia.

Leonardo played all seven games in his second World Cup in 1998, helping Brazil to a second-place finish, after a 3–0 loss to hosts France in the final. In the second opening round match against Morocco, he netted one shot and began celebrating, but was later called off-side.

He was last selected to play for Brazil in the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign and ended his international career in 2002 with 60 caps and 8 goals for Brazil.

==Style of play==
A versatile left-footed midfielder, Leonardo was capable of playing in several positions along the pitch; his favoured role was as a playmaker in midfield, either as a left winger, or in a more central role, as an attacking midfielder or as a supporting striker, due to his ability to create chances for teammates, although he was also capable of functioning as a central midfielder, in a deep-lying playmaking role, as a forward, and was even deployed as left-back or wing-back throughout his career, in particular in his youth. An elegant and creative player, Leonardo was mainly regarded for his outstanding technical skills, as well as his vision, and tactical intelligence as a footballer, which made him an excellent assist provider, although he was capable of scoring goals, as well as creating them, due to his accuracy from set-pieces and powerful striking ability from distance, and was known to be a specialist from dead ball situations. Despite his talent and reputation as one of the best Brazilian men&#x27;s footballers of his generation, he was also often injury prone throughout his career.

==Outside football==
Since 2002, Leonardo has dedicated himself to social works with the &quot;Fundação Gol de Letra&quot;, along with his friend, former player Raí.

Leonardo worked for BBC Television in the United Kingdom during the 2006 World Cup as one of their &quot;Match of the Day&quot; analysts, alongside another former World Cup winner, Marcel Desailly. He appeared again as a &quot;Match of the Day&quot; analyst on 1 June 2007 alongside Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer. This was the first England game at the new Wembley Stadium finishing 1–1 with Brazil.

==Coaching career==

In December 2007, Leonardo was interviewed for the vacant position of director of football at Premier League side West Ham United.

===AC Milan===
In early 2008, Leonardo was appointed technical director of his former club AC Milan. Later that same year, he obtained Italian citizenship after 12 years in Italy as a resident.

After Carlo Ancelotti left Milan to become the manager of Chelsea at the end of May 2009, Leonardo was named head coach of Milan despite still lacking the required coaching badges (he was set to attend a UEFA A coaching course in June 2009). He was, however, exempted from requiring a UEFA Pro license, which is mandatory for Serie A managers, due to being a former World Cup winner as a player. Leonardo wasted no time in declaring that he wanted his team to play attractive attacking football, even invoking the name of his old mentor, Telê Santana.

After a poor start of season, featuring a shock 0–4 loss to crosstown rivals Inter Milan, that started speculation about his possible dismissal from the head coaching post at Milan, results started improving for the &quot;rossoneri&quot; under Leonardo, also thanks to the application of a 4–2–1–3 tactic (nicknamed also &quot;4–2–fantasy&quot; by Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani). This tactic, quite unusual in Italian football and greatly focusing on creative players such as Ronaldinho, Andrea Pirlo and Clarence Seedorf, led Milan to improved results at both Serie A and UEFA Champions League level, including a remarkable 3–2 win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium against Real Madrid and a 3–0 away win to Juventus which enabled Leonardo&#x27;s side to finish in second place at the half-way point of the season, six points shy of leaders Inter with a game in hand. However, the path to the Champions League final was halted prematurely as Milan were eliminated in the first knockout round by Manchester United in a 2–7 aggregate loss (2–3, 0–4).

In the final weeks of the season, it was speculated that Leonardo could leave Milan at the end of the season. In April 2010, Leonardo confirmed divergences with club owner and Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi, defining their relationship as &quot;difficult&quot;. It was confirmed that Leonardo would leave Milan by mutual agreement after their season ending game against Juventus. Leonardo waved an emotional goodbye to a packed San Siro, as he managed his side&#x27;s last game with a 3–0 win against Juventus.

===Inter Milan===

On 24 December 2010, after days of speculation, it was confirmed Leonardo would take over as head coach of fresh FIFA Club World Cup champions Inter Milan, replacing Rafael Benítez in a somewhat controversial move, due to the Brazilian&#x27;s long career with rivals Milan as both player and manager; he agreed an 18-month contract due to expire on 30 June 2012. Leonardo started extremely well, collecting 30 points from 12 games with an average of 2.5 points per game, better than his predecessors Benítez and José Mourinho. On 6 March 2011, Leonardo set a new Italian Serie A record by collecting 33 points in 13 games; the previous record was 32 points in 13 games, achieved by Fabio Capello in 2004–05.

On 15 March 2011, Leonardo led Inter to a memorable 3–2 Champions League away victory over Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the round of 16 after losing the first leg at home. On 2 April 2011, Internazionale lost 3–0 against their fierce rivals Milan, and when Inter, two weeks later, lost 2–0 against relegation battlers Parma, the club&#x27;s title ambitions had effectively ended. On 6 April, Inter lost 5–2 to Schalke 04 in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. On 29 May 2011, Inter defeated Palermo 3–1 to give Leonardo his first and only trophy as a manager of Inter, the Coppa Italia. He resigned on 18 June.

==Executive career==

===Paris Saint-Germain===

In June 2011, speculation arose about the future of Leonardo at Inter Milan after some media cited about talks between him and the new Qatari owners of Paris Saint-Germain, where Leonardo already spent one season as a player in the 1996–97 season. Following that, Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti began searching a replacement for Leonardo, then hiring former Genoa boss Gian Piero Gasperini as new head coach and releasing Leonardo from his contract thereafter. In July 2011, Leonardo was then introduced as new director of football of PSG, being responsible for the club&#x27;s major transfer market decisions. His first signings included several high-profile players from Serie A, such as Jérémy Ménez, Mohamed Sissoko, Salvatore Sirigu, Javier Pastore and Thiago Motta, and was the mastermind behind the appointment of his friend Carlo Ancelotti as head coach of PSG.

In May 2013, Leonardo was banned for nine months, after he was accused of pushing a referee at the end of a game against Valenciennes in which Thiago Silva was sent off. The ban was extended to 13 months in July 2013. On 10 July, he tendered his resignation as sporting director and left the French champions at the end of August. His ban was overturned in June 2014 by the Paris Administrative Tribunal, at which point he announced that he would sue the French Football Federation for &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; damages.

===AC Milan===
In July 2018, following a change of ownership at Milan and the removal of Marco Fassone and Massimiliano Mirabelli from their respective roles as managing director and director of football, the club&#x27;s new owners Elliott Management Corporation announced the appointment of Leonardo as their new sporting director. In his capacity, he also serves as director of football and supervised the captures of Gonzalo Higuaín and Mattia Caldara from Juventus as his first two signings.

In December 2018, he obtained his sporting director diploma through the Coverciano Technical Centre.

===Return to Paris Saint-Germain===

On 1 July 2019, it was announced that Leonardo would be the new sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain following his departure from Milan on mutual consent.

In the 2019–20 season, Leonardo made several signings for PSG, including Abdou Diallo, Ander Herrera, Idrissa Gueye, Mauro Icardi, Pablo Sarabia, and Keylor Navas. The club went on to complete a domestic treble and finish runner-up in the UEFA Champions League, a first final for Paris.

In May 2022, Leonardo was sacked by Paris Saint-Germain. Despite his successful attempts at convincing Neymar to stay in Paris, Leonardo is generally viewed by observers as having had a net negative impact on PSG&#x27;s development during his second spell as sporting director.

<doc id="1129191" wikidata="Q8017472" url="?curid=1129191" title="William Reid (VC)">
<text>William Reid (21 December 1921 – 28 November 2001) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He earned his Victoria Cross as a pilot in the Royal Air Force Bomber Command during the Second World War.

Born in Baillieston, Lanarkshire, he applied to join the RAF on the outbreak of war. After initial training, he was selected as a bomber pilot, and soon became a flying instructor himself. He was eventually given an operational posting, flying several raids before that on Düsseldorf which led to the award of the VC. On a later raid he was shot down and became a prisoner of war in Germany. He left the RAF after the war, and worked in the agricultural industry.

On 19 November 2009 his VC was sold at auction for £384,000, a record for a VC awarded to a recipient from the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
William Reid was born in Baillieston, near Glasgow, on 21 December 1921 the son of a blacksmith. He was educated at Swinton Primary School and Coatbridge Higher Grade School and studied metallurgy for a time, but then applied to join the RAF. After training in Canada, he received his wings and was a sergeant when he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 19 June 1942. He then trained on twin-engined Airspeed Oxfords at Little Rissington before moving to the Operational Training Unit at RAF North Luffenham. There, his skill as a pilot led to his being selected as an instructor, flying the Vickers Wellington, albeit with the promise of a posting to an Avro Lancaster heavy bomber unit. He was promoted to flying officer on 19 December 1942.

The posting did not materialise until July 1943, when he was sent to 1654 Conversion Unit, RAF Wigsley, near Newark-on-Trent, where he flew his first operational mission as second pilot, in a Lancaster of 9 Squadron, in a raid on Mönchengladbach. In September he was posted to 61 Squadron at RAF Syerston, Newark, to commence Lancaster bombing operations, and flew seven sorties to various German cities before the raid on Düsseldorf.

==Düsseldorf==
Reid was a 21-year-old acting flight lieutenant, serving in 61 Squadron when he took part in the raid on Düsseldorf, Germany, for which he was awarded his VC.

On the night of 3 November 1943, while still underway to the target area in Düsseldorf, the windscreen of Reid&#x27;s Lancaster (serial LM360) was shattered by rounds from an attacking Messerschmitt Bf 110 night fighter, badly damaging the cockpit and rear gun turret. In spite of multiple injuries Reid continued on his mission, though was again attacked shortly afterwards by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, killing his navigator and fatally wounding the wireless operator. Reid himself was further wounded, as was the flight engineer. A section of the Lancaster&#x27;s starboard tailplane had also been shot away. Reid again decided to carry on, saying later in an interview that his main reason for pressing on was that turning back would have involved flying through or across the following bomber stream, with the danger of mid-air collision.

Reaching the target, Reid released his bomb load and set course for home. Plotting a course back to Syerston, without a navigator, Reid gratefully noticed the searchlights of RAF Shipdham, a USAAF-operated base in Norfolk.

Despite his wounds and loss of blood, Reid successfully landed his plane, though its damaged undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft slid along the runway. The wireless operator died in Shipdham&#x27;s medical centre but five of the crew survived.

Reid was awarded the VC on 14 December 1943, with the citation reading:

==617 Squadron==
After a period in hospital, Reid went to C Flight, 617 (Dambuster) Squadron at RAF Woodhall Spa in January 1944 and flew sorties to various targets in France. He was promoted to substantive flight lieutenant on 14 June 1944.

On 31 July 1944, 617 Squadron was linked with 9 Squadron for a &quot;Tallboy&quot; deep penetration bomb attack on a V-weapon storage dump at Rilly-la-Montagne, near Rheims. As Reid, flying in Lancaster Mk.I ME557 KC-S, released his bomb over the target at 12,000 ft, he felt his aircraft shudder under the impact of a bomb dropped by another Lancaster 6,000 ft above. The bomb ploughed through his aeroplane&#x27;s fuselage, severing all control cables and fatally weakening its structure, and Reid gave the order to bail out.

As members of his crew scrambled out, the plane went into a dive, pinning Reid to his seat. Reaching overhead, he managed to release the escape hatch panel and struggled out just as the Lancaster broke in two. He landed heavily by parachute, breaking his arm in the fall. Within an hour he was captured by a German patrol and taken prisoner. After various transfers, he ended the war in Stalag III-A prisoner of war camp at Luckenwalde, west of Berlin.

==Post war==
Reid was demobilised in 1946 and resumed his studies, first at the University of Glasgow and later at the West of Scotland Agricultural College. After graduating from the University of Glasgow in 1949, he went on a travelling scholarship for six months, studying agriculture in India, Australia, New Zealand, America and Canada. He retained a reserve commission until 15 January 1949.

==Later years==
In 1950, he became an agricultural adviser to the MacRobert Trust, Douneside. From 1959 to his retirement in 1981, he was an adviser to a firm of animal feed manufacturers.

Reid is interviewed and provides a vivid description of the mission for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross in episode 12, &quot;Whirlwind – Bombing Germany (September 1939 – April 1944)&quot;, of the acclaimed 1973-74 British documentary television series, &quot;The World at War&quot;.

==Family==
Reid married Violet Campbell Gallagher, a daughter of William Gallagher, sports editor of the &quot;Glasgow Daily Record&quot; in 1952. She was reportedly unaware that he was a VC holder until they were married.

==Death==
William Reid died at the age of 79 on 28 November 2001, survived by his wife and their two children. On 19 November 2009, his VC was sold at an auction by medal specialists Spink. It went to an anonymous bidder for £384,000, a record for a VC awarded to someone from the United Kingdom. The bidder was later revealed to be Melissa John, in memory of her late brother, and that she had outbid the buyers acting for Michael Ashcroft in the auction.

<doc id="1129203" wikidata="Q1777531" url="?curid=1129203" title="Christian Günther">
<text>Christian Ernst Günther (5 December 1886 – 6 March 1966) was Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Hansson III Cabinet. The unity government was formed after the Soviet attack on Finland in November 1939, the Winter War, and it was dissolved on 31 July 1945.

Günther, whose father had been Swedish diplomat and whose grandfather briefly had been prime minister, had entered the civil service at the age of 30. He was eight years later transferred to the Foreign Ministry from the position as personal secretary of Prime Ministers Hjalmar Branting and Rickard Sandler. In the Foreign Ministry, he advanced in the 1930s to the position immediately beneath Foreign Minister Rickard Sandler, as &quot;Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot; and then was Accredited as ambassador to Norway, where he intended to stay until retirement.

Günther&#x27;s main achievement was to defend Sweden&#x27;s neutrality during the Second World War, which made his country escape the fate of the occupied Norway and the defeated Finland. The dominant historiography for decades after the war ignored the Holocaust and used what it called the &quot;small state realist&quot; argument that neutrality and co-operation with Germany were necessary for survival since Germany was vastly more powerful. Concessions were limited and made only if the threat was too great, neutrality was bent but not broken, national unity was paramount and Sweden had the neutral right of trading with Germany. Swedish iron was needed by Germany, which had nothing to gain and much iron to lose by an invasion.

Sweden was run by a unity government, which included all major parties in the Riksdag.

== Personal background ==
Günther was hardly a typical representative for the diplomatic corps. Although a perpetual student of law, his ambitions were rather that of a writer, drama, lyrics and a few novels, not without some success. Unanimous testimony describes him as a man of unassuming ways, high intelligence and a bohemian personality, with a significant lack of ambition; he made his visits in the office as brief as possible. He was passionate for harness racing and had the nerves of a habitual gambler.

Günther represents the last generation of cultural Scandinavists, who were sympathetic to the relative political liberalism in Denmark and Norway. He was influenced from French and English thinking, unlike the &quot;ancien régimes&quot; of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Beside that, he was virtually ignorant of the English-speaking world. Like many other liberal Swedes, he was untouched and rather alienated by Finland&#x27;s political and cultural development after 1809, which was signified by a high regard for the autocratic Gustavian Constitution of 1772, the fervent anti-Germanic Fennomania and the bloody aftermath of the Civil War.

As a foreign minister, Günther favoured policies that were rather in the taste of pro-German Conservatives than of pro-Soviet Radicals. Both during the war and after the Allies&#x27; victory, he was the target of criticism, which chiefly argued that the nation&#x27;s soul would have been better saved by a less indulgent position toward Nazi Germany and a more yielding attitude towards the Allies, even if that had resulted in a German invasion and occupation. Together with his aristocratic appearance and bourgeois upbringing, that has rendered him being sometimes characterized as a conservative. Günther himself would hardly have approved, as he was an ardent anti-Nazi; a religious sceptic; and, according to his wife, Ingrid, a cautious supporter of the Social Democrats.

Günther, who had distanced himself from the state church by a civil marriage, was buried in a civil funeral.

== Situation during appointment as Foreign Minister ==
A serious cabinet crisis in Stockholm put an end to his mission in Norway. The failure of Foreign Minister Rickard Sandler&#x27;s policy, which had been characterized by high-profile diplomatic support for Finland without sufficient agreement from other Social Democratic ministers for concrete military actions outside of Sweden&#x27;s borders, was starkly illuminated by the run-up to and the outbreak of the Winter War. The cabinet&#x27;s refusal to authorize even limited military actions for the defence of de-militarized Åland before the war and, even more significantly, the waters between Åland and Stockholm, made Sandler&#x27;s resignation unavoidable, but it was somewhat postponed because of the tense international situation.

The outbreak of the Winter War put Sweden in one of the worst political crises since the secession of Finland in 1809. A strong and vociferous public opinion demanded unlimited solidarity with Finland. However, a broad parliamentary majority opposed not only military support of Finland but also other actions that might put Sweden in danger of an invasion by either Nazi Germany or its ally, the Soviet Union.

To overcome the crisis, a National Unity Government was deemed essential, which proved difficult since the Conservative Party, led by Gösta Bagge, supported at least moderately-activist policies for the defence of Finland. To solve the difficulties, it was agreed to appoint a &quot;non-political&quot; Foreign Minister from among Sweden&#x27;s top diplomats, which was thought to put the foreign policies in the firm grip of the party leaders in the cabinet, where they planned to broker compromises.

== Foreign minister ==
Günther left no memoirs, no diaries, very few personal letters of interest for historians, and actually remarkably few notes and writings from his time as Foreign Minister. Hence, an assessment of Günther must rely on the account of colleagues in the cabinet and in the Foreign Ministry.

As a Foreign Minister, Günther represented a stark contrast to Rickard Sandler&#x27;s idealist policies. Günther&#x27;s preferred line was a cautious realpolitik, which was adapted to the very limited options of a small country during a war between great power neighbours. Like many, maybe most, of his contemporary peers, he expected German culture to be inherently stronger than the Nazi barbarism. Thus, he did not subscribe to the idea of the world war as primarily a clash of democracy against fascism but rather as a traditional war on dominance of Continental Europe. In that light, a German victory over the Soviet Union, the latter being the latest appearance of Sweden&#x27;s old arch-enemy, could not be perceived as particularly alarming. On that point, Günther was close to the most conservative cabinet members.

==In popular culture==
In the Swedish television movie &quot;Four Days that shook Sweden - The Midsummer Crisis 1941&quot; (Sveriges Television TV1, from 1988), his role is played by the Swedish character actor Sven Lindberg.

<doc id="1129205" wikidata="Q2568047" url="?curid=1129205" title="Schweizer-Reneke">
<text>Schweizer-Reneke, sometimes referred to as Schweizer, is a town in the North West Province of South Africa. It is the administrative centre of Mamusa Local Municipality. It is commonly referred to as Schweizer/ Mzwera.

== History ==

Schweizer-Reneke was formerly part of the old Transvaal Republic. Founded on 1 October 1888, the town is situated on the banks of the Harts River, with six regional roads exiting the town. The town is named after Captain C.A. Schweizer and Field Cornet C.N. Reyneke. Both men distinguished themselves and were among the ten soldiers killed while storming the stronghold of the Khoekhoe Korana and their chief David Massouw on the nearby Mamusa Hill on 2 December 1885 during an action to put an end to cattle rustling in the area. The remains of the stone fortifications of Chief David Massouw can still be seen on Mamusa Hill.

== Economy ==

The principal crops of the region around Schweizer-Reneke are mainly maize, cotton, groundnuts, sunflower seeds and soybeans. In addition, cattle and sheep farming is practiced in the region on a relatively large scale on the grasslands where the soil is unsuitable for cultivation. Schweizer-Reneke is rich in diamond deposits. This led to large scale private diamond mining in the area.

Wenzel Dam, just north of the town on the Harts River, has been developed into a holiday resort but sadly is now in decay.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, the town of Schweizer-Reneke has a population of 41,226, of whom 2,376 live in the town centre while the rest live mostly in the adjacent township of Ipelegeng. 92.5% of the people in the urban area described themselves as &quot;Black African&quot;, 4.3% as &quot;White&quot;, 2.4% as &quot;Coloured&quot;, and 0.5% as &quot;Indian or Asian&quot;. 86.1% of the people in the urban area speak Tswana as their first language, while 5.8% speak Afrikaans, 2.2% speak Sotho and 1.8% speak English.

== Education ==
The town has public secondary schools:
*Hoërskool Schweizer Reneke
*Ipelegeng High School
*Itshupeng Secondary School
*Reabetswe Secondary School

It also has public primary schools:
*Laerskool Schweizer Reneke
*Kolong Primary School
*Ikgomotseng Primary School
*Kgatontle Primary School
*Tshwaraganelo Primary School
*Mamusa Primary School

== Sport ==

Schweizer Reneke is home to a soccer club &quot;Mamusa United FC&quot; that plays in the provincial football league.
There is also a big soccer team formed by the Department of Social Development: Mamusa Service Point. The team boasts with local popular players like Molwantwa Sheriff Lehihi, Kwenzekile Scova Mqweba and Peter Maiyane Kgalapa amongst others.

<text>Geoffrey Lewis Capes JP (23 August 1949 – 23 October 2024) was a British shot putter, strongman, and Highland Games competitor. He was famous in the UK in the 1980s for his sporting prowess and appearances on television in shows such as &quot;Superstars&quot; and the World&#x27;s Strongest Man.

Capes represented England and Great Britain in field athletics, specialising in the shot put, an event in which he was twice Commonwealth champion, twice European indoor champion, and competed at three Olympic Games. As of October 2024, he still holds the British record for the shot put from 1980 when he putted it . As a strongman, he won World&#x27;s Strongest Man twice, and World Muscle Power Classic twice, along with numerous other titles including Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man and Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man. As a Highland Games competitor, he was six times world champion, first winning the title in Lagos in 1981 and the final title in 1987. He also set over 15 strength related world records.

Following retirement from competitive sport, he continued to be involved in strength athletics as a referee, event promoter, and coach. He also ran a sportswear retail shop, and became renowned as a world-class breeder of birds. Capes stood and weighed in his prime.

==Early life==
Capes was born on 23 August 1949 in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, the seventh of nine children. He weighed at birth. He was the seventh child of Eileen (Alcock) Capes, though the eldest of her three children by her third husband Bill Capes. His father was a land worker, while his mother, who stood six feet tall and weighed 250 pounds, was a matron at a care home. Of his older siblings, the elder two were Braithwaites and the middle four Cannons. Capes told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The family wasn&#x27;t just working class, but was on the lowest rung of that very long ladder that is the English class system.&quot; He grew up in the town and went to the local secondary school, George Farmer. During his time at school, his behaviour and academic performance were reportedly poor, resulting in frequent caning. On one occasion, a teacher twisted his ear until it bled as punishment for misbehaving in class. The same day, Capes&#x27;s mother confronted the teacher and punched him.

Capes described himself as a troubled youth and recalled that he was constantly fighting. &quot;If the next town came down on a Friday and there were only eight or nine of them, I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Go back and get some more, he told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2023. &quot;I&#x27;d fight them on my own. I was quite quiet but there was an inner aggression.&quot; Despite his natural inclination towards physical activities, Capes initially struggled to find success in sports. He faced a one-year ban from a local football team after striking a referee during a match. He left school at 14 to work as a labourer, carrying sacks of potatoes and taking on various odd jobs. At the age of 15, he loaded 20 tons of potatoes onto a lorry in under 20 minutes, just to demonstrate that it could be done. By 16, he had taken on the role of assistant coalman and odd-job worker for a haulier in Lincolnshire. During tea breaks at the haulier&#x27;s yard, he developed his arm strength by lifting two four-stone weights overhead. He also created a makeshift gymnasium with two friends. During this time, he joined a local athletics club, where he met Stuart Storey, a hurdler who later competed in the 1968 Olympics. Capes stated that Storey helped him turn his life around and guided him during his early days in athletics. Storey encouraged him to try shot put and participate in competitions. Lacking the means to buy proper clothes, Capes attended events wearing garments left behind by his mother&#x27;s patients after they died. His first attempt at competitive shot-putting ended with him placing second-to-last in the finals of the 1964 All England Schools Athletics Championships.

Capes was a gifted sportsman, and represented Lincolnshire at basketball, football and cross-country. In addition he was a decent sprinter, running 23.7 s for the 200 m. Growing up on the Lincolnshire fens he had an early fascination with the natural world and cared for injured birds and animals from when he was a young boy. After school he worked as a coalman and an agricultural labourer, being able to load twenty tons of potatoes in twenty minutes. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather, uncle and older brothers, he joined Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 1970, and remained in the police for ten years; his departure from the police came when he decided to compete in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, despite the British Government&#x27;s calls for a boycott, and was thereby forced to resign his position.

==Athletics==
Capes was a shot putter and represented his country over a span of 11 years, winning two Commonwealth Games and two Indoor European Championship titles. His first major competition was the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he finished fourth. In the next two games in 1974 and 1978 he took the gold medal. In this period he also became the European Indoor Champion in both 1974 and 1976. His first Olympic experience was in 1972 when he competed in Munich. The 21-year-old Capes did not make it past the qualifying round, but improved on this considerably four years later. Having thrown a personal best of on 28 May 1976 at Gateshead, he went into the 1976 Montreal Olympics as one of the favourites for the gold medal. He came second in his qualifying group but sixth overall in the final, the winner being Udo Beyer of East Germany. 1980 was the year Capes threw the longest distance of his career, in Cwmbran on 18 May 1980 being a new Commonwealth and British record. He went into the Olympics as the athlete with the best distance that year and once again a favourite for the title. However, he eventually placed fifth, the winner being Vladimir Kiselyov whose Olympic record of was well short of what Capes had achieved prior to the Games. Capes said his performance at the 1980 Moscow Olympics had left him &quot;numbed with disappointment&quot;.

Capes is the most capped British male athlete of all time, receiving 67 International caps and earning 35 wins, not including a further 35 caps for England. He is a winner of 17 national titles, including being seven times a winner of the AAA championship and three times UK champion. In 1983 he was voted Britain&#x27;s best-ever field athlete. Capes&#x27; 1980 British record still stands. In 2003 Carl Myerscough threw but the distance was not ratified.

Colin Bryce, a former Strongman and television commentator for the World’s Strongest Man competition, said of Capes in an interview, “When you saw him sprint, you realized just what an absolutely terrifying athlete he was, as in terrifyingly good. He wasn’t just a big lump.”

==Strongman==
As a strongman, Capes became a household name in Britain and many parts of the world. He was particularly known for his incredible hand and arm strength, easily tearing London telephone directories in half and bending rolled steel bars measuring over 1 inch in diameter, and three feet in length. Capes turned fully professional in 1980, the Olympics in Moscow being his last event as an amateur athlete. He had already begun to make a name as a strongman having won the inaugural Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man in 1979. In that competition he beat Bill Anderson, the World Highland Games champion into second place. Bill went on to the 1979 World&#x27;s Strongest Man, the first Briton to compete in this tournament, whilst Capes concentrated on his athletic career.

In 1980 the Olympics dominated the year and Capes did not compete in Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man, but he did compete later in the Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man competition and won that. This ensured his invitation to the 1980 World&#x27;s Strongest Man and on his first entry he came third behind the by then more experienced Bill Kazmaier and Lars Hedlund. In 1981 he returned and improved to second place, again behind Kazmaier, and in 1982 he came fourth.

1983 World&#x27;s Strongest Man was the first held outside the United States and in Christchurch, New Zealand he held off the challenge of a world class field including the young Jón Páll Sigmarsson, Canadian world powerlifting champion, Tom Magee, and the European powerlifting champion, Siem Wulfse to take his first World&#x27;s Strongest Man title. Capes won the truck pull and weight over bar and came second in farmer&#x27;s walk, bale hoist and sack load events. The duel between Sigmarsson and Capes heralded the beginning of a great rivalry. The following year in Mora, Sweden, Sigmarsson, eleven years Capes&#x27; junior, took the title proclaiming &quot;The King has lost his crown!&quot;. Capes retorted &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; with a third place finish. He won the sled push and came second in caber toss, rock press and floor press that year.

Capes came to 1985 World&#x27;s Strongest Man determined to regain his title from Sigmarsson. The competition was held in Cascais, Portugal and Capes managed to win the truck pull, medley, arm over arm pull and swingletree. Despite a horrible last place finish in the crucifix hold, Capes managed to collect enough points to secure his second World&#x27;s Strongest Man title, holding off Sigmarsson and Cees de Vreugd. Capes&#x27; did not forget to celebrate after the end of the final event, the loading race saying &quot;The King has not lost his crown!&quot;. Their rivalry thrived and Sigmarsson won once again in 1986 with Capes coming second.

Aside from the World&#x27;s Strongest Man, Capes also won Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man three times: in London (1980), Amsterdam (1982) and Marken (1984). He regained his Britain&#x27;s Strongest Man title in 1981 and again in 1983. Capes also won the World Muscle Power Classic championship in 1987, and was ascribed two World Muscle Power championships by the creator of the event, David Webster, although other sources suggest the 1987 victory was the only one. In 1987 his win in the World Muscle Power was accompanied by a win in the World Strongman Challenge and he is one of only three athletes to have won all three titles. There was no World&#x27;s Strongest Man that year, but an event was held designed specifically to put the three most successful strongmen against one another.

In 1986, Capes won the UK Truck Pulling Championship.

1987 Pure Strength featured Bill Kazmaier, Jón Páll Sigmarsson and Geoff Capes and was held at Huntly Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Capes entered despite having been in hospital the previous weekend with strained trapeziums. Strong performances in the first few rounds belied his condition but he eventually pulled out during the log-lift and ended the contest in third place. Capes, the oldest of the three, was close to strongman retirement at this stage and the next year, at the 1988 World Muscle Power Classic he finished second, and it proved to be his last major outing as a strongman.

For years, Capes was England’s most famous athlete. He featured in various commercials, notably for Volkswagen, where he flipped a Polo car to inspect its underside. His popularity extended to children&#x27;s games and television, with the World’s Strongest Man competition becoming a Christmas Day staple. He was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II, who &quot;howled in laughter&quot; when her glove stuck to his sweaty hands after he won the Braemar Games in 1982. Former strongman and commentator Colin Bryce remarked compared Cape&#x27;s unparalleled fame in Britain to that of an NFL star in the United States, describing him as &quot;a true household name.”

Capes&#x27; daily diet reportedly included seven pints of milk, two loaves of bread, a dozen eggs, two steaks, a jar of baked beans, two cans of sardines, a pound of butter, and a leg of lamb.

== Highland Games ==
Capes competed at many Highland Games gatherings in Scotland and across the world and became a hugely popular and respected figure. He won the World Heavy Events title in Lagos in 1981, in a year when there were two world championships, the second won in Melbourne by Bill Anderson. He went on to win again in 1983 in Carmunnock and the next four consecutive titles, making him the most successful competitor ever in terms of titles. He set world records in many disciplines, including the 56 lb Weight over bar and brick lifting. As a Highland competitor he was dubbed Geoff Dubh Laidir, translated as Black Strong Geoff. He held the record for shot put at Cowal Highland Gathering − Scotland&#x27;s only international heavy athletics competition − since 1980 at .

==Sport after retirement==
Capes went on to coach many rising stars in both athletics and strength athletics. Adrian Smith later took fifth spot at the World&#x27;s Strongest Man under the combined coaching of Capes and Bill Pittuck. Capes also helped promote the &quot;Daily Star&quot; funded UK Strongest Man tournaments until the turn of the millennium.

==Life outside sport==
Outside his sporting career Capes was for a long time a policeman and prior to that was a member of the Air Training Corps. Prior to his athletic retirement he had been awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, for services to the community. He went on to run a sportswear retail shop in Holbeach, before moving to Spalding where in 1998 he became a Justice of the Peace. At the height of his fame in 1985, the game &quot;Geoff Capes Strongman&quot; was released on the Amstrad CPC, the ZX Spectrum, the BBC Micro, the Acorn Electron and the Commodore 64, featuring a truck pulling and tug-of-war, allowing control of each muscle group. He also appeared in a memorable TV commercial for the Volkswagen Polo Mk2 in which he picked the car up and rolled it over with his bare hands. His profile also led to numerous appearances on British television, one such example being in the Tyne Tees Television programme &quot;Supergran&quot; in the episode &quot;Supergran Grounded&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; where he lost a challenge from Welsh strongman/showman George Davies (Strang the Strong, Georgie Muscles). In 1987, Capes was a timekeeper on the charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

Capes appeared on the fourth series of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, alongside Patsy Kensit, where he threw a bomb at Johnny Vegas and in 2007 he became the face of Cadbury&#x27;s Wispa relaunch, appearing on billboards and magazine advertisements. As of spring 2010, he was in the advert for the Great British Food Fight, which appeared on Channel 4, as well as being in an advert for Churchill insurance.

=== Bird breeding ===
Aside from sport and television appearances, Capes was famed for breeding budgerigars and had success (a former world champion) on the show bench with his Recessive Pieds. He participated in budgerigar shows across Europe and won a world championship in 1995. In 2008, he was appointed president of the Budgerigar Society and often served as a judge in competitions. &quot;There’s something about their colour and beauty that fascinates me&quot;, Capes told the &quot;Sunday People&quot;. &quot;They bring out my gentler side.&quot; At the peak of his breeding career, he owned over 300 budgies. He constructed a small wooden aviary behind his house and prepared meals for them each morning. Capes frequently appeared in the pages of &quot;Cage &amp; Aviary Birds&quot;. He took up the hobby when a policeman, having chatted for an hour to a man he had to arrest for non-payment of a fine.

==Personal life==
Capes lived in Stoke Rochford, near Grantham. He married Gillian Fox in 1971. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. His daughter Emma was English Schools&#x27; shot put champion and Youth Olympics bronze medallist. His son Lewis played American football for the London Monarchs. He had four grandchildren. In 2018, he married Kashmiro Bhatti. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace on the Spalding bench in 1998. His autobiography &quot;Big Shot&quot; was published by Hutchinson in 1981.

<doc id="1129210" wikidata="Q204825" url="?curid=1129210" title="Bebeto">
<text>José Roberto Gama de Oliveira (born 16 February 1964), known as Bebeto (), is a Brazilian former professional football player who played as a forward. He entered politics in the 2010 Brazilian general elections and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro representing the Democratic Labour Party.

With 39 goals in 75 appearances for Brazil, Bebeto is the sixth highest goalscorer for his national team. He was the top scorer for Brazil at the 1989 Copa América when they won the tournament. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he formed a formidable strike partnership with Romário to lead Brazil to a record fourth World Cup title, he is regarded as one of the greatest players in his generation. He was also a member of the Brazilian team that won the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, while he won Olympic silver and bronze medals with Brazil at the 1988 and 1996 Summer Olympic Games respectively. In 1989, Bebeto was named South American Footballer of the Year.

In January 2013 and August 2014, Bebeto was named as one of the six Ambassadors of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and Rio 2016 in Brazil, others being Ronaldo, Amarildo, Marta, Carlos Alberto Torres, Mário Zagallo.

==Early career==

Bebeto, who was born in Salvador, Bahia, started his career in 1983 with Vitória.

==Club career==
He played for Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Cruzeiro and Botafogo in Brazil, Deportivo La Coruña and Sevilla in Spain, Toros Neza in Mexico, Kashima Antlers in Japan, and Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, finally retiring in 2002.

===Deportivo La Coruña===
Bebeto spent four years in Spain at Deportivo La Coruña, scoring an impressive 86 goals in 131 games. Bebeto became the top scorer in La Liga in his first season at Deportivo, scoring 29 goals in the 1992–93 season. In the next season, 1993–94 season, Deportivo had the chance to win their first ever La Liga title by beating Valencia in the last match of the season. In a very evenly matched contest Deportivo had a golden opportunity to seal the victory and thus the league title. They were given a penalty kick just minutes from the end. The official penalty taker all season had been Bebeto (after Donato, who wasn&#x27;t in the field), who this time, refused to take the penalty. Eventually, Miroslav Đukić took the penalty and failed to score; hence, the match ended with a 0–0 draw, effectively handing Barcelona the title.

===Later career===
In 1996 Bebeto returned to play for native club Flamengo, but after just 15 games, Bebeto returned to Spain to play for Sevilla, for whom he never scored. In 1997, Bebeto joined Cruzeiro for just one match, the 1997 Intercontinental Cup final against Borussia Dortmund. Despite his presence, the Belo Horizonte side lost the match 2–0. Bebeto returned to goalscoring form at native clubs Vitória in late 1997 and Botafogo in early 1998, which saw him being picked for Brazil&#x27;s World Cup defence in 1998.

In 2001, he was rejected by Scottish side St Mirren, who were willing to pay his wages but had reservations about his fitness. On 5 September 2002, he joined his final club at the age of 38, Al-Ittihad of Saudi Arabia, after pledging to join Vasco da Gama on 28 August.

==International career==
For Brazil, Bebeto scored 39 goals in 75 caps after making his debut in 1985. He played in three World Cups: 1990, 1994, and 1998. In 1994, he was one of the best players of the tournament, scoring three goals and providing two assists for the eventual champions, and then repeated the feat four years later as Brazil finished second to hosts France.

During the 1994 World Cup, Bebeto formed a formidable partnership with Romário, after they succeeded in putting their personal differences aside. Bebeto and Romário were fierce rivals in the Spanish League. Bebeto led the Spanish first division with 29 goals in 1992–93 and Romário led it with 30 goals in 1993–94. It was Romário who gave Bebeto the nickname Chorao, or Crybaby, for his habit of pouting to referees. It was also Romário who called a news conference before the World Cup to announce that he would not sit next to Bebeto on the team&#x27;s flight to the United States. Today, however, Bebeto and Romario are friends, with Bebeto claiming that they talk often. In an interview in 2018, Bebeto praised his partnership with Romario: &quot;I played with Romario only in the national team. We played only one game together at Flamengo before he left for Europe. Do you know that Brazil have never lost a game when Bebeto and Romario played together? Not a single game! Besides, every time we played together at least one of us scored.&quot;

Bebeto became a household name for his goal celebration in the 1994 World Cup in the United States. His wife had delivered their third child two days before a quarter-final match against the Netherlands in the scorching heat of Dallas. After scoring, Bebeto ran to the sideline, brought his arms together and began rocking an imaginary baby. Teammates Romário and Mazinho quickly joined in. That child, a boy who was named Mattheus, started his football career with the youth side of Brazilian club Flamengo.

He won a silver medal for Brazil in the 1988 Summer Olympics. He was later chosen to be an over-23 player at the 1996 Summer Olympics, scoring a hat-trick in the Bronze medal match against Portugal.

On 8 December 2012 a friendly match was played by Brazil Masters vs IFA All Stars at Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata, India. Bebeto scored a goal for Brazil Masters as they defeated All Stars by 3–1.

==Style of play==
Regarded one of Brazil&#x27;s greatest strikers, Bebeto was a prolific goalscorer and an excellent finisher, who was known for his consistency and determination throughout his career, although he was also injury-prone and was criticised for his character. Despite not being imposing physically due to his lack of height and slender physique, he was a fast and opportunistic player, who used his agility, offensive movement, and intelligence to lose his markers in tight spaces. Due to his vision, outstanding technical skills, close control on the ball, and his ability to play off other strikers and provide them with assists, he was often employed as a playmaking attacking midfielder or as a supporting striker early on in his career, drawing influence from Zico&#x27;s playing style. He was later deployed as a striker or as a centre-forward, however, where he excelled, due to his eye for goal, and remained in this position for the rest of his career.

==Coaching career==
Bebeto was hired on 16 December 2009 as the América Football Club&#x27;s head coach. After an average performance at the Taça Guanabara, he was sacked on 13 February 2010. He had a record of three wins, one draw and four losses.

==Personal life==
Bebeto is married to Denise Oliveira, who played volleyball for Flamengo in 1988, with whom he has two sons and one daughter, Stéphannie who is married to Carlos Eduardo. His son, Mattheus, is a professional footballer. Bebeto&#x27;s brother-in-law, Luiz Fernando Petra, was murdered in 2002, during a federal deputy election in Rio de Janeiro.

==Media==
Bebeto features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover of certain editions of &quot;FIFA 97&quot;.

<text>Natalie du Toit OIG MBE (; born 29 January 1984) is a South African swimmer. She is best known for the gold medals she won at the 2004 Paralympic Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. She was one of two Paralympians to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; the other being table tennis player Natalia Partyka. Du Toit became the third amputee ever to qualify for the Olympics, where she placed 16th in the 10 km swim.

==Early life==
Du Toit was born in Cape Town, South Africa and attended Timour Hall Primary school. She began competing internationally in swimming at the age of 14. In February 2001, her left leg was amputated at the knee after she was hit by a car while riding her scooter back to school after swimming practice. She was 17 at the time. Three months later, before she had started walking again, she was back in the pool with the intention of competing in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Du Toit swims without the aid of a prosthetic limb.

She completed her scholastic education at the Reddam House, Cape Town after which she studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Cape Town, specializing in genetics and physiology. In her free time she does motivational speaking.

==Swimming career==
 Du Toit first competed internationally at the age of 14, when she took part in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. During the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Du Toit, who was then 18 years old, won both the multi-disability 50 m freestyle and the multi-disability 100 m freestyle in world record time. She also made sporting history by qualifying for the 800 m able-bodied freestyle final – the first time that an athlete with a disability had qualified for the final of an able-bodied event. At the closing of the Manchester Commonwealth Games, she was presented with the first David Dixon Award for Outstanding Athlete of the Games.

In 2003, competing against able-bodied swimmers, Du Toit won gold in the 800 metres freestyle at the All-Africa Games as well as silver in the 800 metres freestyle and bronze in the 400 metres freestyle at the Afro-Asian Games.

She narrowly missed qualifying for the Olympics in Athens in 2004, but during the Paralympics that were held in the same city, she won one silver and five gold medals. In the same year, her courage and achievements were acknowledged with a nomination for the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year 2004 with Disability Award. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games she repeated her previous performance by winning the same two golds as she had in Manchester. In 2006 Du Toit also won six gold medals at the fourth IPC World Swimming Championships, finishing third overall in a race which included 36 males and 20 females.

On 3 May 2008, Du Toit qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics after finishing fourth in the 10 km open water race at the Open Water World Championships in Seville, Spain. Her time was only 5.1 seconds off the winner in a race that made its first Olympic appearance in Beijing. At the Beijing Olympics women&#x27;s 10 km race, she finished in 16th place, 1:22.2 minutes behind the winner. She also took part in the 2008 Summer Paralympics, winning five gold medals.

On 27 August 2012, just three days before the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, she announced her intention to retire at the end of the event.

==2008 Olympic and Paralympic opening ceremonies==
South Africa&#x27;s Olympic Committee chose Du Toit to carry their flag at the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, making her the first athlete to carry a flag in both Olympics and Paralympics in a single year.

<text>The city of Plymouth, Devon, England is bounded by Dartmoor to the north, the Hamoaze to the west, the open expanse of water called Plymouth Sound to the south and the river Plym to the east.

The Cattewater is that stretch of water where the mouth of the river Plym merges with Plymouth Sound, just to the east of Sutton Pool. It is around this Pool that the manor of Sutton started, which grew to form the present day city. On the northern shore of this confluence of waters there was a rock outcrop, which it was claimed, had the appearance of a cat. This gave its name to this stretch of water and eventually the name of Cattedown to the adjoining wharves and commercial area. Apart from an occasional small oil tanker the area is now used mostly by fishing trawlers, yachts, and smaller pleasure craft. There is a water taxi across it from the Mayflower Steps on Plymouth Barbican to Mount Batten and also Oreston both on the southern bank.

The spelling &#x27;Cattewater&#x27; is not old or consistent. Local sources and texts together with early maps and drawings refer to the opening of the estuary variously as Catwater, Cat Water and Catt Water. Internet search engines throw up other versions.

<text>Mahakavi Kumaran Asan (12 April 1871 – 16 January 1924) was a poet of Malayalam literature, Indian social reformer and a philosopher. He is known to have initiated a revolution in Malayalam poetry during the first quarter of the 20th century, transforming it from the metaphysical to the lyrical and his poetry is characterised by its moral and spiritual content, poetic concentration and dramatic contextualisation. He is one of the triumvirate poets of Kerala and a disciple of Sree Narayana Guru. He was awarded the prefix &quot;Mahakavi&quot; in 1922 by the Madras university which means &quot;great poet&quot;.

== Biography ==

Asan was born on 12 April 1873, in a merchant family belonging to Ezhava community in Kayikkara village, Chirayinkeezhu taluk, Anchuthengu Grama Panchaayath in Travancore to Narayanan Perungudi, a polyglot well versed in Malayalam and Tamil languages, and Kochupennu as the second of their nine children. His early schooling was at a local school by a teacher by name, Udayankuzhi Kochuraman Vaidyar, who taught him elementary Sanskrit after which he continued his studies at the government school in Kayikkara until he was thirteen. Subsequently, he joined the school as a teacher in 1889 but had to quit as he was not old enough to hold a government job. It was during this time, he studied the verses and plays of Sanskrit literature. Later, he started working as an accountant at a local wholesale grocer in 1890, the same year he met Shree Narayana Guru and became the spiritual leader&#x27;s disciple.

Narayana Guru&#x27;s influence led Asan to spiritual pursuits and he spent some time at a local temple, in prayers and teaching Sanskrit. Soon, he joined Guru at his Aruvippuram hermitage where he was known as &quot;Chinnaswami&quot; (&quot;young ascetic&quot;). In 1895, he moved to Bangalore and studied for law, staying with Padmanabhan Palpu. He stayed there only until 1898 as Palpu went to England and a plague epidemic spread over Bangalore and Asan spent the next few months in Madras before proceeding to Calcutta to continue his Sanskrit studies. At Calcutta, he studied at Tarka sastra at the Central Hindu College, studying English simultaneously and also got involved with the Indian Renaissance, but his stay was again cut short due to plague epidemic. He returned to Aruvippuram in 1900.

Asan was also involved with the activities of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) and became its secretary in 1904. The same year, he founded Vivekodayam, a literary journal in Malayalam, and assumed its editorship. Under his leadership, the magazine became a monthly from a bi-monthly. In 1913, he was elected to the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly (Sri Moolam Praja Sabha), the first popularly elected legislature in the history of India. He relinquished the position at SNDP in 1919 and a year later, took over the editorship of &quot;Pratibha&quot;, another literary magazine In 1921, he started a clay tile factory, &quot;Union Tile Works&quot;, in Aluva but when it was found that the factory was polluting the nearby palace pond, he shifted the project to a site near Aluva river and handed over the land to SNDP for building an &quot;Advaitashramam&quot;. Later, he moved to Thonnakkal, a village in the periphery of Thiruvananthapuram, where he settled with his wife. In 1923, he contested in assembly election from Quilon constituency but lost to Sankara Menon.

Asan married Bhanumathiamma, the daughter of Thachakudy Kumaran Writer in 1917.

===Death===
Asan died on 16 January 1924, after a boat named Redeemer carrying him capsized in the Pallana river in Alappuzha. His body was recovered after two days and the place where his mortal remains were cremated is known as &quot;Kumarakodi&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Kumaran Asan was one of the triumvirate poets of modern Malayalam, along with Vallathol Narayana Menon and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer. Some of the earlier works of the poet were &quot;Subramanya Sathakam&quot; and &quot;Sankara Sathakam&quot;, which were devotional in content but his later poems were marked by social commentary. He published &quot;Veena Poovu&quot; (the fallen flower) in December 1907 in &quot;Mithavadi&quot; of Moorkoth Kumaran which went on to become a literary classic in Malayalam; its centenary was celebrated in 2017 when a book, &quot;Veenapoovinu 100&quot; was published which carried an introduction by M. M. Basheer and an English translation of the poem by K. Jayakumar. &quot;Prarodanam&quot;, an elegy, mourning the death of his contemporary, friend and grammarian, A. R. Raja Raja Varma, &quot;Khanda Kavyas&quot; (poems) such as &quot;Nalini&quot;, &quot;Leela&quot;, &quot;Karuna&quot;, &quot;Chandaalabhikshuki&quot;, &quot;Chinthaavishtayaaya Seetha&quot;, and &quot;Duravastha&quot; are some of his other major works. Besides, he wrote two epics, &quot;Buddha Charitha&quot; in 5 volumes and &quot;Balaramayanam&quot;, a three-volume work.

== Honours ==
In 1958, when Joseph Mundassery was the Minister of Education, the Government of Kerala acquired Asan&#x27;s house in Thonnakkal and established the &quot;Kumaran Asan National Institute of Culture&quot; (Kanic), as a memorial for the poet, the first instance in Kerala history when the government took over a poet&#x27;s property to convert it into a memorial. It houses an archives, a museum and a publications division. Asan Memorial Association, a Chennai-based organization, has built a memorial at Kayikkara, the birthplace of the poet. They have also instituted an annual award, Asan Smaraka Kavitha Puraskaram, for recognising excellence in Malayalam poetry. The award carries a cash prize of 30,000 and Sugathakumari, O. N. V. Kurup, K. Ayyappa Panicker and K. Satchidanandan are some of the recipients of the award.

<text>One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society is a 1964 book by the German–American philosopher and critical theorist Herbert Marcuse, in which the author offers a wide-ranging critique of both the contemporary capitalist society of the Western Bloc and the communist society of the Soviet Union, documenting the parallel rise of new forms of social repression in both of these societies, and the decline of revolutionary potential in the West. He argues that the &quot;advanced industrial society&quot; created false needs, which integrated individuals into the existing system of production and consumption via mass media, advertising, industrial management, and contemporary modes of thought.

This results in a &quot;one-dimensional&quot; universe of thought and behavior, in which aptitude and ability for critical thought and oppositional behavior wither away. Against this prevailing climate, Marcuse promotes the &quot;great refusal&quot; (described at length in the book) as the only adequate opposition to all-encompassing methods of control. Much of the book is a defense of &quot;negative thinking&quot; as a disrupting force against the prevailing positivism.

Marcuse also analyzes the integration of the industrial working class into capitalist society and new forms of capitalist stabilization, thus questioning the Marxian postulates of the revolutionary proletariat and the inevitability of capitalist crisis. In contrast to orthodox Marxism, Marcuse champions non-integrated forces of minorities, outsiders, and radical intelligentsia, attempting to nourish oppositional thought and behavior through promoting radical thinking and opposition. He considers the trends towards bureaucracy in supposedly Marxist countries to be as oppositional to freedom as those in the capitalist West. &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; bolstered Marcuse&#x27;s fame as a contemporary Western philosopher.

==Summary==
Marcuse strongly criticizes consumerism and modern &quot;industrial society&quot;, which he claims is a form of social control. Marcuse argues that while the system the West lives in may claim to be democratic, it is actually totalitarian. A form of technological rationality has imposed itself on every aspect of culture and public life, and has become hegemonic. Through our identification with this hegemonic ideology of modern industrial society, this ideology doesn&#x27;t only represent a form of &quot;false consciousness&quot;, yet rather has succeeded in becoming reality. 

Modern industrial societies have furthermore created an &quot;affluent society&quot;, which in increasing comfort have disguised the exploitative nature of the system, and have therefore strengthened means of domination and control. Modern &quot;affluent society&quot; therefore limits opportunities for political revolution against capitalism.

Marcuse contends that in contemporary consumer societies, a select few wield the power to shape our conceptions of freedom by offering us the means to purchase our own happiness. In this state of &quot;unfreedom&quot;, consumers act irrationally by working more than they are required to in order to fulfill actual basic needs, by ignoring the psychologically destructive effects, by ignoring the waste and environmental damage it causes, and by searching for social connection through material items.

It is even more irrational in the sense that the creation of new products, calling for the disposal of old products, fuels the economy and encourages the need to work more to buy more. An individual loses his humanity and becomes a tool in the industrial machine and a cog in the consumer machine. Additionally, advertising sustains consumerism, which disintegrates societal demeanor, delivered in bulk and informing the masses that happiness can be bought, an idea that is psychologically damaging.

There are alternatives to counter the consumer lifestyle. Anti-consumerism is a lifestyle that demotes any unnecessary consumption, as well as unnecessary work, waste, etc. But even this alternative is complicated by the extreme interpenetration of advertising and commodification because everything is a commodity, even those things that are actual needs.

==Reception== 

The critical theorist Douglas Kellner asserted that &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; stands out as a paramount work of the 1960s and remains one of the most subversive literary contributions of the twentieth century. Despite its pessimism, represented by the citation of the words of Walter Benjamin at the end of this book that &quot;Nur um der Hoffnungslosen willen ist uns die Hoffnung gegeben&quot; (&quot;It is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us&quot;), it influenced many in the New Left as it articulated their growing dissatisfaction with both capitalist societies and Soviet communist societies.

Marcuse praised Paul Mattick&#x27;s critique of the book.

The philosopher Ronald Aronson wrote in 2014 that &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; is more prescient than Marcuse could have ever realized and that it is more relevant than ever.

<doc id="1129234" wikidata="Q17075790" url="?curid=1129234" title="Caerdroia">
<text>A caerdroia is a Welsh turf maze, usually in the sevenfold Cretan labyrinth design. They were created by shepherds on hilltops and were apparently the setting for ritual dances, the nature of which has been lost. At the centre of each caerdroia was a small hillock—in Welsh, &quot;twmpath.&quot; A gathering for folk dancing in Wales is still called a &quot;twmpath dawns&quot;. It is a typical labyrinth of Welsh but there is a specimen in Italy to Petrella Tifernina discovered by the historian Mario Ziccardi. This specimen is the only known one in the Mediterranean area for now.

==Etymology==
&quot;Caerdroea&quot; or &quot;Caer Droea&quot; is a Welsh word meaning &quot;a labyrinth, a maze; maze cut by shepherds in the sward, serving as a puzzle.&quot; It also means &quot;Troy, Walls-of-Troy&quot;. Variations include &quot;Caer Droia&quot; and &quot;Caerdroia&quot;, the latter being the spelling generally used today.

Because of the similarity between Welsh &quot;troeau&quot; (a plural form of &quot;tro&quot; &#x27;turn&#x27;) and the second element &quot;Troea&quot; (&#x27;Troy&#x27;), the name was later popularly interpreted as meaning &#x27;fortress of turns&#x27; (&quot;caer&quot; = &#x27;fort&#x27;). 

Many turf mazes in England were named Troy Town or The Walls of Troy (or variations on that theme) presumably because, in popular legend, the walls of the city of Troy were constructed in such a confusing and complex way that any enemy who entered them would be unable to find his way out.

==Gwydir Forest==
There is a Caerdroia in Gwydir Forest, above the Conwy Valley, Wales. It is a permanent Forest Labyrinth, built in 2005 by Theatre Cynefin, Golygfa Gwydyr (a social enterprise based in Llanrwst), and local young people. The paths measure a mile in length, making it possibly the largest labyrinth of its kind in the world. The Caerdroia has been a venue for a number of performances, initially by Theatr Cynefin, and since 2012 by Theatr Dan-y-Coed. Since its inception and construction on a grassy site at Pen-y-Parc, one of the highest parts of the forest, the low conifers between the paths have grown considerably, and it is now an integral part of the forest.

==Mythical link==
There is another tenuous connection between Wales and Troy that has been disproven by historians but remains a resilient myth. Geoffrey of Monmouth, following the early Welsh historian Nennius, created a Christian/classical genealogy which placed Brutus of Troy, grandson of Aeneas and liberator of enslaved Trojans, as founder of Britain. This Brutus is generally considered a medieval fiction.

<doc id="1129242" wikidata="Q1527282" url="?curid=1129242" title="The Flying Lizards">
<text>The Flying Lizards were an experimental English new wave band, formed in 1976. They are best known for their eccentric cover version of Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;, featuring Deborah Evans-Stickland on lead vocals, which reached the UK and North American record charts in 1979. They followed this with their self-titled album that year, which reached number 60 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Career==
Formed and led by record producer David Cunningham, the group were a loose collective of avant-garde and freely improvising musicians, including David Toop and Steve Beresford as instrumentalists, with Deborah Evans-Stickland, Patti Palladin and Vivien Goldman as main vocalists.

In August 1979 the Flying Lizards appeared twice on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performing their hit single &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;. They also appeared in February 1980, performing follow-up single &quot;TV&quot;. Virgin Records extended the band&#x27;s recording contract after the success of &quot;Money&quot;. The group released their début album &quot;The Flying Lizards&quot; in 1979. The album included two songs – &quot;Her Story&quot; and &quot;The Window&quot; – written and sung by Goldman. Their single issues included their postmodern cover versions of songs such as Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;.

The 1981 album &quot;Fourth Wall&quot; received praise from critics but did not sell well. &quot;Top Ten&quot; (1984), with vocalist Sally Peterson, released by Statik records, consisted entirely of covers, done in a similarly deliberately emotionless, and robotic, style (described by the &quot;NME&quot; at the time as &quot;Sloane Rap&quot;), including two singles, James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Sex Machine&quot; and &quot;Dizzy, Miss Lizzy&quot;, as well as an album track of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Suzanne&quot;. Cunningham and Peterson worked together on music production for film and advertising after &quot;Top Ten&quot; was released, including a re-recording of &quot;Money&quot;.

The Flying Lizards version of Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; remained popular, and was used in the film soundtracks for &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, &quot;Empire Records&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Lord of War&quot;, as well as in the Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning American television medical drama &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, documentary series &quot;People&#x27;s Century&quot;, and in &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, the follow-up to the UK TV drama &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. It was also used in the episode &quot;Venus Rising&quot; of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, the episode &quot;Follow the Money&quot; of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and in a commercial for Taco Bell in 2011.

An album of dub instrumentals, &quot;The Secret Dub Life of the Flying Lizards&quot;, recorded by David Cunningham mostly in 1978, was finally released in 1995. The first two albums, &quot;The Flying Lizards&quot; and &quot;Fourth Wall&quot;, were re-released by RPM in 2010, with the catalogue number RETROD883.

&quot;Money&quot; reached the UK top 40, and was the band&#x27;s only single to do so.

<doc id="1129250" wikidata="Q1427420" url="?curid=1129250" title="Flutter-tonguing">
<text>Flutter-tonguing is a wind instrument tonguing technique in which performers flutter their tongue to make a characteristic &quot;FrrrrrFrrrrr&quot; sound. The effect varies according to the instrument and at what volume it is played, ranging from cooing sounds on a recorder to an effect similar to the growls used by jazz musicians.
== Notation ==

In sheet music, the technique is usually indicated with the standard tremolo markings on a note alongside a text instruction to flutter the note. The German marking &quot;Flatterzunge&quot; is often abbreviated to &quot;Flz.&quot; or &quot;Flt.&quot;. The Italian &quot;frullato&quot; is sometimes abbreviated to &quot;frull&quot;. In English, the most common indication is &quot;f.t.&quot; Other markings that composers have used to indicate flutter tonguing include: coupe de lange roulé, en roulant la langue, tremolo dental, tremolo avec la langue, tremolo roulé, vibrata linguale, vibrando, and colpo di lingua among others. However, simply writing (3-line) tremolo marks on all rhythmic values without other indication is most generally accepted.

== Usage ==
One of the earliest uses of flutter-tonguing was by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. In the opening of the final act, Tchaikovsky makes the flutes flutter-tongue to depict the cascading river of rose-oil seen as Clara and the Nutcracker are welcomed to the kingdom of Confiturembourg: he named the effect &quot;frullato&quot;, as did the flautist who first introduced him to the technique, Alexander Khimichenko.

The effect has since been called for in many classical compositions, where it is most often used on flutes, recorders, clarinets, saxophones, bassoons, trumpets, and trombones, but can be used on other brass and woodwind instruments as well. The technique became quite common in the 20th century, notably occurring in the music of Schoenberg and Shostakovich, where it can have a nightmarish or sarcastic effect, or conversely by Benjamin Britten who uses the effect on the recorder in &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; to imitate the cooing of a dove, or in &quot;Curlew River&quot; on solo flute to suggest both the mental state of the Madwoman and also the curlews she identifies with.

Both Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss used the effect as well. In Don Quixote, Strauss imitates the distant bleating of sheep with flutter-tongued notes in the horns. Notably, he uses the marking &quot;Zungenschlag&quot; (tongue-beat) in this passage from Variation II. Elsewhere in the score, he used the traditional German &quot;Flatterzunge&quot;. Mahler used this traditional marking as well, but he also deviated from it in the finale of his Second Symphony, where he uses the marking &quot;Zungenstoss&quot; (tongue-thrusts). On sustained whole notes, the tongue thrusts Mahler requires have the effect of a flutter tongue.

Flutter-tonguing is also common in jazz music, particularly that which is associated with New Orleans or Vaudeville style. Cootie Williams was a master of combining a plunger mute with the flutter tongue to create a conversational effect.

==Method==
The traditional method for producing a flutter tongue effect is to roll the tip of the tongue as rapidly as possible. This is done by performing an isolated alveolar trill while playing the notes desired. Some players find it difficult or even impossible to roll their tongues in this way, possibly due to ankyloglossia.

Uvular fluttertonguing is a method of producing a flutter tongue effect with the back of the tongue. The instrumentalist performs a uvular trill, which produces an only slightly rougher frrrr effect. The uvular trill does NOT produce the traditional growl sound from the jazz idiom. Real growling is produced by singing or groaning while playing a tone. The uvular trill is sometimes used simultaneously with groaning for an even more aggressive sound.

Uvular fluttertonguing can also be used when an alveolar trill is not appropriate to achieve the effect of fluttertonguing, e.g. in the low range of the flute, or when a faster fluttertongue is desired. Fluttertonguing can also be used in conjunction with other types of articulation.

Either method requires more than the usual volume of air to produce the effect.

<text>Cupressus sempervirens, the Mediterranean cypress (also known as Italian cypress, Tuscan cypress, Persian cypress, or pencil pine), is a species of cypress native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Iran. While some studies show it has modern medicinal properties, it is most noted for uses in folk medicine, where the dried leaves of the plant are used to treat various ailments. It is well-adapted to the environmental conditions that it lives in due to its ability to survive in both acidic and alkaline soils and withstand drought. &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; is widely present in culture, most notably in Iran, where it is both a sacred tree and a metaphor for &quot;the graceful figure of the beloved&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; is a medium-sized coniferous evergreen tree growing up to 35 m (115 ft) tall, with a conic crown with level branches and variably loosely hanging branchlets. It is very long-lived, with some trees reported to be over 1,000 years old.

&quot;Cupressis sempervirens&quot; produces lateral shoots, or branches, which often grow upwards towards a light source. The foliage grows in dense, dark green sprays. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are ovoid or oblong and 25–40 mm long. The cones have 10–14 scales, which are green at first and mature to brown about 20–24 months after pollination. The male cones are 3–5 mm long and release highly allergenic pollen in late winter. The cones of &quot;C. sempervirens&quot; can withstand years of being sealed and are known to perform serotiny. The tree is moderately susceptible to cypress canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Seiridium cardinale&quot;, and can suffer extensive dieback where this disease is common. The species name &quot;sempervirens&quot; comes from the Latin for &#x27;evergreen&#x27;.

==Uses==
&quot;C. sempervirens&quot; has been widely cultivated as an ornamental tree for millennia outside of its native range, mainly throughout the Mediterranean region and in other areas with similar hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters, including California, southwest South Africa, and southern Australia. It can also be grown successfully in areas with cooler, moister summers, such as the British Isles, New Zealand, and the Pacific Northwest. It is also planted in Florida and parts of the coastal southern United States as an ornamental tree. In some areas, particularly the United States, it is known as &quot;Italian&quot; or &quot;Tuscan cypress&quot;. Within its native range, &quot;C. sempervirens&quot; has historically been planted in gardens and cemeteries and used as a windbreak alongside roads. The tree can also prevent damage to land caused by violent weather.
The vast majority of the trees in cultivation are selected cultivars with a crown, with erect branches forming a narrow to very narrow crown often less than a tenth as wide as the tree is tall. The dark green &quot;exclamation mark&quot; shape of these trees is a highly characteristic signature of Mediterranean town and village landscapes.

In cosmetics, it is used as an astringent, for firming, as an anti-seborrheic, for anti-dandruff, for anti-aging and as a fragrance. It is also the traditional wood used for Italian harpsichords.
Dried seeds of &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; are sometimes used to help people control skin conditions such as acne and to heal cuts or scrapes. The oil from the leaves of the plant can aid in recovery from minor ailments like nasal congestion.

== Habitats ==
&quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; grows primarily in places with wet winters and hot summers; in the spring and autumn, the tree grows out its roots, stems, and leaves. Like most plants, &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; requires light for such growth. Because the tree must survive wet winters and hot, dry summers, its roots are adapted to be stout and shallow for easier gathering of the nutrients in the soil. The roots of &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; are adapted to function in both acidic and alkaline soils.

== In culture ==
===Iran===

In Persian, &quot;C. sempervirens&quot; is called the &quot;Graceful Cypress&quot; (&quot;sarv-e nāz&quot;), and has a strong presence in culture, poetry and gardens. It bears several metaphors, including the &quot;graceful figure and stately gait of [the] beloved&quot;. Iranians considered cypress to be a relic of Zoroaster. A Zoroastrian tradition recorded by Daqiqi maintains that King Vishtaspa, after converting to Zoroastrianism, ordered a cypress brought from paradise by Zoroaster to be planted near the first fire temple.

The oldest living cypress is the Sarv-e-Abarkooh in Iran&#x27;s Yazd Province. Its age is estimated to be approximately 4,000 years.

===Symbolism===
In classical antiquity, the cypress was a symbol of mourning, and in the modern era, it remains the principal cemetery tree in both the Muslim world and Europe. In the classical tradition, the cypress was associated with death and the underworld because it failed to regenerate when cut back too severely. Athenian households in mourning were garlanded with boughs of cypress. Cypress was used to fumigate the air during cremations. It was among the plants that were suitable for making wreaths to adorn statues of Pluto, the classical ruler of the underworld.

The poet Ovid, who wrote during the reign of Augustus, records the best-known myth that explains the association of the cypress with grief. The handsome boy Cyparissus, a favorite of Apollo, accidentally killed a beloved tame stag. His grief and remorse were so inconsolable that he asked to weep forever. He was transformed into a cypress tree, with the tree&#x27;s sap as his tears. In another version of the story, it was the woodland god Silvanus who was the divine companion of Cyparissus and accidentally killed the stag. When the boy was consumed by grief, Silvanus turned him into a tree and thereafter carried a branch of cypress as a symbol of mourning.

In Jewish tradition, cypress is held to be the wood used to build Noah&#x27;s Ark and Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and is mentioned as an idiom or metaphor in biblical passages, either referencing the tree&#x27;s shape as an example of uprightness or its evergreen nature as an example of eternal beauty or health. The tree features in classical Aramaic writings. 

In popular culture, &quot;C. sempervirens&quot; is often stereotypically associated with vacation destinations in the Mediterranean region, especially Italy. The tree has been seen on travel posters for decades.

==Other characteristics==
In July 2012, a forest fire lasting five days burned 20,000 hectares of forest in the Valencian village of Andilla. However, a group of 946 cypress trees about 22 years old was virtually unharmed, and only 12 cypresses were burned. The Andilla cypresses had been planted by the CypFire European project to study various aspects of the cypresses, including fire resistance.

<text>The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) is a major space research centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), focusing on rocket and space vehicles for India&#x27;s satellite programme.It is located in Thiruvananthapuram, in the Indian state of Kerala.

The centre had its beginnings as the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1962. It was renamed in honour of Vikram Sarabhai, often regarded as the father of the Indian space program. H.G.S. Murthy was appointed as the first director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.

The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre is one of the main research and development establishments within ISRO. VSSC is an entirely indigenous facility working on the development of sounding rockets, the Rohini and Menaka launchers, and SLV, ASLV, PSLV, GSLV and LVM3 families of launch vehicles.

==History==
The space centre is the largest among the ISRO facilities. It is a centre for the design and development of satellite launch vehicles and associated technologies. The centre pursues research and development in a host of distinct technology domains including aeronautics, avionics, and composites, primarily for the purpose of advancing the development of launch vehicle technology in India.

After incorporation of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) in 1962, its first act was the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) at Thumba, in Thiruvananthapuram. Thumba was picked as the launch site for sounding rockets for meteorological and upper atmospheric research due to its location on the geomagnetic equator. H.G.S. Murthy was appointed as the first director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.

21 November 1963 marked India&#x27;s first venture into space, with the launch of a two-stage Nike Apache sounding rocket from TERLS. The first rockets launched were built in United States.

The first Indian designed and built rocket, RH-75, made its maiden flight on 20 November 1967. This was the 52nd launch of a sounding rocket from TERLS. It was flown twice again in 1967 and another 12 times in 1968, making a total of 15 RH-75 flights.

Among the sounding rockets to have flown from TERLS were Arcas-1, Arcas-11, Centaure-1, 11A and 11B, Dragon-1, Dual Hawk, Judy Dart, Menaka-1, Menaka-1Mk 1 and Mk11, Nike Tomahawk, M-100, Petrel, RH-100, RH-125, RH-200 (S), RH-300, variants of RH-560, etc. There have been a total of nearly 2200 sounding rocket launches from TERLS, so far.

Over the years VSSC has designed, developed and since 1965 started launching a family of sounding rockets under the generic name, Rohini Sounding Rockets (RSR) to serve a range of scientific missions. The currently operational Rohini Sounding Rockets are RH-200, RH-300, RH-560 and their different versions. These sounding rockets are launched for carrying out research in areas like meteorology and upper atmospheric processes up to an altitude of about 500 km.

TERLS was formally dedicated to the United Nations on 2 February 1968, by then Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi. Although no direct funding from the UN was involved, scientists from several countries including United States, Russia (former USSR), France, Japan, Germany and UK continue to utilize the TERLS facility for conducting rocket based experiments. Over 1161 USSR meteorological sounding rockets called M-100 were launched from TERLS every week from 1970 until 1993.

After the sudden demise of Vikram Sarabhai on 30 December 1971, TERLS and associated space establishments at Thiruvananthapuram were renamed as the &quot;Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre&quot; in his honour.

In the early 1980s, VSSC was instrumental in the development of India&#x27;s Satellite Launch Vehicle program, SLV-3. This was followed in the late 1980s with the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), for launching 150 kg satellites into near earth orbits.

In the 1990s, VSSC contributed to the development of India&#x27;s workhorse launch vehicle, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). 

In 2023, the VSSC created FEAST (Finite Element Analysis of Structures), an analysis program that may be used to do Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on a variety of structures, including as buildings, aircraft, satellites, rockets, and so forth. It is now accessible for application in Indian academic institutions and business sectors. It will lessen reliance on pricey, licensed software from overseas companies. It comes in three versions: academic, premium, and professional, and it can run on Linux distributions and Microsoft Windows. In an effort to increase the software&#x27;s use among undergraduate and graduate students, S. Somanath and S. Unnikrishnan Nair wrote a book that provides insights into the program. 

==Facilities==
VSSC is a leading centre of ISRO responsible for the design and development of launch vehicle technology .VSSC has a large workforce of about 4500 employees, most of them specialists in frontier disciplines.

In addition to its main campus located at Thumba and Veli, VSSC has integration and checkout facilities located at Valiamala. Facilities for development of reinforced plastics and composites are located at Vattiyoorkavu in Thiruvananthapuram City. The ISRO plant in Aluva produces ammonium perchlorate, a vital ingredient for solid propellant motors. Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) and the Space Physics Laboratory (SPL) are also within the VSSC campus. SPL focuses on research activities in disciplines such as atmospheric boundary layer physics, numerical atmospheric modeling, atmospheric aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, trace gases, atmospheric dynamics, thermospheric-ionospheric physics, planetary sciences, etc. Recently a new Tri-sonic wind tunnel will also be set up at the facility.

=== Trisonic Wind Tunnel ===
As part of three space infrastructure projects totaling ₹1,800 crore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally inaugurated the Trisonic Wind Tunnel (TWT) at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) on February 27, 2024 for testing the aerodynamic design of rockets to make them more efficient. Following the 1.2-meter TWT at National Aerospace Laboratories in Bengaluru and the Defence Research and Development Organization&#x27;s Hypersonic Wind Tunnel (HWT) at the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex in Hyderabad, the TWT is India&#x27;s third hypersonic wind tunnel. The TWT may function in three different wind velocity ranges: subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic. 

==Programs==
Over the last four decades VSSC has become the leading centre for development of launch vehicle technology.

VSSC has a matrix organization based on Projects and Entities. Core project teams manage project activities. System level activities of the projects are carried out by system development agencies. Major programmes of VSSC include the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), Rohini Sounding Rockets, Space Capsule Recovery Experiment, Reusable Launch Vehicles and Air Breathing Propulsion.

VSSC pursues research and development in the fields of aeronautics, avionics, composites, computer and information technology, control guidance and simulation, launch vehicle design, mechanical engineering, mechanisms vehicle integration and testing, propellants polymers and materials, propulsion propellants and space ordnance, and systems reliability. These research Entities are the system development agencies for the Projects and thus provide for the realization of the project objectives. Management systems area provides for programme planning and evaluation, human resource development, budget and manpower, technology transfer, documentation and outreach activities.

VSSC is certified for compliance to ISO 9001:2000 quality management system. The quality objectives of the centre are planning, implementing and maintaining a quality system during design, development, production, and operation of subsystems and systems for launch vehicles. It also aims at achieving continued improvement in process for its zero defect goal.

ISRO has developed an array of sounding rockets and four generations of launch vehicles and thus establishing operational space transportation system. Most of launch vehicle development is carried out at VSSC.

Current focus of VSSC is on the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), the GSLV Mk III and the Reusable Launch Vehicle- Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD).

In January 2007, the Space Capsule Recovery Experiment Module (SRE-1) was safely brought back to earth after 10 days in orbit. This involved a host of technologies developed at VSSC, including thermal protection systems to withstand the large heat flux of atmospheric re-entry.

VSSC made significant contribution to India&#x27;s maiden mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1.

VSSC R&amp;D efforts have included solid propellant formulations. Another focus area has been navigation systems; the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) established at Vattiyoorkavu is a part of VSSC.

VSSC is involved in the development of air-breathing vehicles. A reusable launch vehicle technology demonstrator is under development, which will be tested soon.

VSSC also has programs focused on applications of space technology including village resource centres, telemedicine, tele-education, disaster management support and outreach through Direct To Home television broadcast.

<text>Jan Remco Theodoor Campert (Spijkenisse, 15 August 1902 – 12 January 1943) was a Dutch journalist, theater critic and writer who lived in Amsterdam. During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II Campert was arrested for aiding Jews. He was held in the Neuengamme concentration camp, where he died.

Campert is best known for his poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Eighteen Dead&quot;), describing the execution of 18 resistance workers (15 resistance fighters and three communists) by the German occupier. Written in 1941 and based on an account published in &quot;Het Parool&quot;, the poem was clandestinely published in 1943 as a poetry card (&quot;rijmprent&quot;) by what became the De Bezige Bij publishing house to raise money to hide Jewish children.

He was the father of the novelist and poet Remco Campert.

The Jan Campert Prize is named after him.

<text>How Far Can You Go? (1980) is a novel by British writer and academic David Lodge. It was renamed Souls and Bodies when published in the United States. It won the Whitbread Book of the Year award (1980), and went straight into paperback in Penguin Books in 1981.

==Plot summary==
The book deals with the intersecting lives of a group of English Catholics from their years as students at University College London in the early 1950s up to the late 1970s. The characters are confronted with a wide range of issues and experiences including marriage, contraception, adultery, illness, grief and, most important of all, the changes in the Catholic Church brought about by the Second Vatican Council and the papal encyclical against contraception, &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; (1968).

The title&#x27;s meaning is twofold: it is on the one hand a reference to how far you ought to go with a member of the other sex before marriage, but also to the question of disorientation in the face of abrupt changes in the Church within only a few years.

==Major themes==
The novel is a bitterly funny satire on life for young English Catholics in the 1950s and 1960s, depicting them juggling the pressures of youth, sexual desire and the modern world with rigid rules about the avoidance of pleasures, the shame of disappointing Christ and the Virgin, and the fear of hell. Yet it also describes how the loss of faith leads to disorientation and sadness in the characters.

==Cover Image==
As explained in the novel &quot;The name of the game was Salvation, the object to get to heaven and avoid Hell. It was like Snakes and Ladders: sin sent you plummeting down towards the Pit; the sacraments, good deeds, acts of self-mortification, enabled you to climb back towards the light.&quot;

<text>Drake&#x27;s Island is a island lying in Plymouth Sound, the stretch of water south of the city of Plymouth, Devon. The rocks which make up the island are volcanic tuff and lava, together with marine limestone of the Devonian period. For more than 400 years the island was fortified.

==Early history==

The first recorded name for the island was in 1135, when it was referred to as St Michael&#x27;s after the chapel erected on it. At some later date the chapel was rededicated to St Nicholas and the island adopted the same name. From the latter part of the 16th century the island was occasionally referred to as Drake&#x27;s Island after Sir Francis Drake, the English privateer who used Plymouth as his home port. Even well into the 19th century, maps and other references continued to refer to the island as St Nicholas&#x27;s Island and it is only in about the last 100 years that this name has slipped into disuse and the name Drake&#x27;s Island has been adopted.

It was from Plymouth that Drake sailed in 1577, to return in 1580 having circumnavigated the world, and in 1583 Drake was made governor of the island. From 1549 the island began to be fortified as a defence against the French and Spanish, with barracks for 300 men being built on the island in the late 16th century.

For several centuries, the island remained the focal point of the defence of the three original towns that were to become modern Plymouth. In 1665 the Leveller Robert Lilburne died imprisoned on the island. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the regicide of Charles I. A few years later John Lambert, a former general of the New Model Army in the English Civil War, was moved to Drake&#x27;s Island from Guernsey, where he had been imprisoned since 1662. Like Lilburne, he never regained his liberty, dying on Drake&#x27;s Island in the winter of 1683.

In June 1774 the first recorded submarine fatality in history occurred north of Drake&#x27;s Island, when a carpenter named John Day perished while testing a wooden diving chamber attached to the sloop &quot;Maria&quot;.

==Drake&#x27;s Island Battery==

The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom recommended a huge programme of new fortifications to defend Plymouth. On Drake&#x27;s Island, the existing battery at the centre of the island was to be replaced by five 12-inch muzzle loading guns in open emplacements. A new battery was to be built on the southwestern end, of 21 9-inch guns in an arc of stone casemates with iron shields. The work was not complete in 1880. Six 12-pounder quick firing guns were added in 1897 and three 6-inch guns became the main armament in 1901; the original muzzle loaders were dumped under a pile of earth. Finally, in 1942, a modern twin 6-pounder gun was installed.

==Recent history==

Following World War II Drake&#x27;s Island remained under the administration of the War Office, which, despite having announced in 1956 that it was no longer needed for defence purposes, did not finally vacate the island until 1963, when Plymouth City Council obtained a lease from the Crown with the aim of establishing a youth adventure training centre there. This centre was opened in 1964, the year in which a mains water supply finally reached the island.

On 1 May 1987 the island got its first telephone line, using a cable attached to the mains water pipe. The telephone number was Plymouth 63393. The warden had previously used the Ministry of Defence system. Drake&#x27;s Island Adventure Centre, under the custody of the Mayflower Centre Trust, operated until 31 March 1989, when the Mayflower Trust surrendered their lease to the Crown and sold off the boats and sports equipment.

In 1995, Drake&#x27;s Island was put up for sale by the Crown Estate, with an asking price of £235,000, and had numerous offers. In the end, a bidding war commenced between the then Plymouth Argyle chairman, Dan McCauley, and a Cheshire-born businessman who wanted to open it to the public. McCauley&#x27;s bid was successful and he bought the island for £384,000 in 1995, with plans to turn it into a hotel complex. In 2003, Plymouth City Council turned down a planning application from McCauley to build a hotel and leisure complex complete with helipad.

By 2014 the island contained derelict military barracks and buildings from the Napoleonic era, and an MoD radio mast. In May 2005 the island attracted British media attention when one of the empty buildings on the island was squatted by a group of anti-nuclear protesters, Trident Ploughshares.
With planning consent secured in April 2017, details were released showing how the Grade II-listed Island House, barracks block and ablutions building could be linked to form a £10 million-plus hotel and spa complex containing 25 bedrooms. In October 2018, the island was put up for sale for £6 million. It was purchased by Morgan Phillips. Phillips plans to open the island to the public with a museum and heritage centre, thirty years after previously closing.

On 15 March 2020, the island received its first public visitors since 1989 when a one-off public tour was held to raise money for St Luke&#x27;s Hospice. Drake&#x27;s Island featured in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s Antiques Road Trip first broadcast on 17 December 2020, and in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s Secret Britain first broadcast on 20 April 2016. Regular guided tours have been held on the island since summer 2020.

<text>The Honda CB500T is a standard motorcycle built by Honda and sold in 1975 and 1976. It bears a close resemblance to the model from which it was derived — the later 5-speed version of the CB450 which was discontinued in 1974. 

==Details==
The engine is an air-cooled double overhead cam (DOHC) vertical parallel twin with 180° crankshaft angle, and torsion bar valve springs. The air/fuel mixture is delivered by two 32 mm Keihin Constant Velocity (CV) carburetors.

The transmission is a 5-speed.

==Reception==
While not receiving much praise from reviewers or riders, &quot;Cycle World&quot; took note of its comfortable and roomy seat in its 1975 test, writing, &quot;Unusual in that it is brown in color, it is long enough to carry a briefcase or passenger without crowding the rider. And the padding is soft enough for comfort. Believe us, without this seat you couldn’t ride a 500T very far and get off smiling.&quot;

<text>Hardgate is a village in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.

Hardgate has probably been settled since neolithic times with a burial site at Knappers Farm, the Cochno Stone (a cup and ring marked stone), and a burial chamber near Cochno Loch providing evidence of this.

Although it is a far older settlement, it is administratively part of nearby Clydebank along with the neighbouring village of Duntocher and now lies in the West Dunbartonshire local authority area. Along with Duntocher and Faifley, Hardgate falls within West Dunbartonshiire&#x27;s &quot;Kilpatrick&quot; ward with a combined population of 12,719 in 2011.

Dunn&#x27;s Mills operated a cotton mill in the 19th century. It continued to produce thread and yarn until its destruction during the Clydebank Blitz in 1941.

The village expanded due to house building by the Clydebank town council after World War II, and later by the Wimpey firm in the early 1970s on what had been green belt land.

The village has one non-denominational school, Goldenhill Primary School.

<text>Duntocher (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Dùn Tòchair&quot; or &quot;Druim Tòchair&quot;) is a village in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. It has an estimated population of 6,850. The etymology of the name of the village indicates that its name means &quot;the fort on the causeway&quot;.

Duntocher has effectively become a northern suburb of the nearby town of Clydebank, as have neighbouring Hardgate and Faifley. Duntocher expanded due to housebuilding by Clydebank Burgh Council after the Second World War, although the area was never formally absorbed into the burgh. When burghs were abolished by local government reorganisation in 1975, however, Duntocher was included in the larger Clydebank District, which existed until the creation of West Dunbartonshire in 1997. Further housing was built by the Wimpey firm in the late 1960s and early 1970s, on what had been green belt land. Along with Faifley and Hardgate, Duntocher falls within West Dunbartonshire&#x27;s &quot;Kilpatrick&quot; ward with a combined population of 12,719 in 2011.

At one time this was the most north westerly point on the Glasgow Corporation Transport tram system, trams operating from here via Hardgate to Clydebank, and at times, on to Partick depot.

Duntocher historically had several cotton and corn mills, driven by the Duntocher Burn which is the traditional boundary between Duntocher and neighbouring village Hardgate.

The Antonine Wall also runs through the village, and ancient Roman fortifications are still visible in the local Goldenhill Park. Lottery funding is to provide funds for a children&#x27;s playpark at Goldenhill. Sir George Macdonald wrote about the findings at Duntocher.

Duntocher has a Roman Catholic church – St. Mary&#x27;s, a United Free Church of Scotland – Duntocher West, and a Church of Scotland – Duntocher Trinity. The village also has one Roman Catholic primary school – St Mary&#x27;s and one non-denominational, Carleith Primary School.

The village has a main street (Dumbarton Road) which acts as the main focal point for village activity. The majority of the villages shops and pubs, the cafe and the local churches and village halls are located along or very close to a small stretch of this road

The village is at the southern edge of the Kilpatrick Hills.

==History==
The Roman Fort at Duntocher has been known about since at least the 18th century. Digital reconstructions of the fort and the fortlet it was built to replace, have been created.

Two &quot;distance slabs&quot; of the Second Legion were found in the area. Other distance slabs by the Second Legion have been mapped with RTI and include one from Balmuildy. The Second Legion is also associated with The Bridgeness Slab. The slabs are two of the four inscriptions on stone found at Duntocher. The first, with its upper right corner missing, also lacks information about its discovery. Both slabs have a capricorn (half goat, half fish) above and a Pegasus (winged horse) below their inscriptions; these are both emblems of the Second Legion. Both slabs also have two decorative pelta shields, one on either side of the slab each of which is embellished with two griffins&#x27; heads. Symmetry suggests both were designed with four rosettes in the corners though one has the upper right rosette missing. Other differences between the slabs are the amount of decoration around the inscription, the Emperor&#x27;s title, but most notably the number of paces being 4,140 versus 3,271. Other find which have been RTI mapped include rooftile fragments, a water nymph fountainhead, and a hypocausted tile.

Until 1649 the villages of Bowling, West Dunbartonshire, Duntocher, Hardgate, Milton and Old Kilpatrick were all part of Kilpatrick Parish, then for a further 240 or so years formed part of Old or West Kilpatrick Parish. In 1889 however, the formation of Dumbarton County Council saw the transfer of authority to that body where it remained until 1975 when the villages were finally split up. Bowling and Milton became part of the Dumbarton District Council area and Duntocher, along with Old Kilpatrick and Hardgate, was absorbed by Clydebank District.

Industry around the village was aided by the nearness of the Duntocher Burn, a fast flowing waterway ideal for industrial purposes. Between 1808 and 1831 four large cotton mills were set up there leading to a significant population increase and subsequent improvements being instituted to road, canal and river transport links. The boom was relatively short lived however and the demise of the cotton industry towards the end of the 1800s left Duntocher the loser. There were coal and lime mines near Duntocher in the 19th century.

Today all five of the villages form a bedroom community for commuters to Clydebank, Dumbarton and Glasgow.

==Culture==
Traditionally a gala was held in the first week in June for Duntocher and Hardgate.

<doc id="1129297" wikidata="Q633145" url="?curid=1129297" title="Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus">
<text>Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus (c. 1449October 1513) was a Scottish nobleman, peer, politician, and magnate. Tradition has accorded him the nickname Archibald &#x27;Bell-the-Cat&#x27; due to his association with the 1482 rebellion against James III of Scotland. He became one of the most powerful nobleman in Scotland through his influential position on the Scottish Marches, and a willingness to be involved in multiple rebellions in the reigns of James III and James IV of Scotland.

==Parents and succession==
Archibald Douglas, eldest son of George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus, head of the Red Douglas line, was born at Tantallon Castle, East Lothian, around 1449. His mother was Isabella Sibbald, daughter of the Master of the Household of James II of Scotland.

During the turbulent 1450s, when Archibald was growing up, his father came out in support of James II, thereby pitching himself against many of his own clan, and the Black Douglas line in particular, who were in rebellion against the king. He was also at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460. After the accidental death of the king during the siege, it was the earl, Archibald&#x27;s father, who is said to have placed the crown on the new child king&#x27;s head, reputedly declaring as he did so: &quot;There! Now that I have set it upon your Grace&#x27;s head, let me see who will be so bold as to move it.&quot;

Archibald succeeded his father as fifth Earl of Angus about two years later, in 1462 or 1463, aged fourteen.

==Actions against James III==
In 1481, during a time of gathering war with England, Angus was appointed Warden of the East March by James III, but the following year took part in the surprise action against the king carried out by a league of Scottish nobles at Lauder on 22 July 1482. This was at a moment when English forces had just invaded Scotland and the secretly disaffected nobles were ostensibly part of the army that James had mustered to repel the invasion. According to David Hume of Godscroft, writing in a later age, it was here that Archibald earned his nickname by offering to &quot;bell the cat&quot;, initiating the action against the king&#x27;s favourite, Thomas (or Robert) Cochrane, as a prelude to the arrest of the king.

Angus is said to have begun the attack by seizing the gold chain from Cochrane&#x27;s neck, then ordering him and others of the king&#x27;s favourites to be hung from Lauder Bridge (Lauder Brig in Scots), located today in the grounds of Thirlestane Castle. The phrase &quot;to bell the cat&quot; comes from the fable &quot;The Mice in Council&quot;, misattributed to Aesop, and refers to a dangerous task undertaken for the benefit of all.

Angus subsequently joined the party of the king&#x27;s disaffected younger brother, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, who was part of the English invasion. Albany had entered into a treaty with Edward IV which gifted suzerainty over Scotland to the English king in return for the right to rule Scotland in place of his brother. While James was in captivity in Edinburgh, Albany did indeed make a short-lived attempt to rule under the name of &quot;Alexander IV&quot;. Eventually, however, by March 1483, both Albany and Angus returned to their allegiance to James who, despite the treasonous alliance with Edward, granted them pardons.

Later in that same decade a more open state of rebellion broke out against the king, this time with greater support of the Scottish nobility, with the king&#x27;s eldest son, James, Duke of Rothesay, counted among their ranks (although not as leader). Angus once again came out against the king. In 1488, he marched against James III at the Battle of Sauchieburn, where the king was killed.

==Reign of James IV==
After Sauchieburn, Angus became for a time one of the guardians of the young king James IV, but soon lost influence to the Homes and Hepburns, and the wardenship of the marches went to Alexander Home. Although outwardly on good terms with James, Angus treacherously made a treaty with Henry VII around 1489 or 1491, by which he undertook to govern his relations with James according to instructions from England. He also agreed to hand over Hermitage Castle, commanding the pass through Liddesdale into Scotland, on the condition of receiving English estates in compensation.

In October 1491 he fortified his castle of Tantallon against James, but had to submit and to exchange his Liddesdale estate and Hermitage Castle for the lordship of Bothwell.

In 1493 Angus again returned to favour, receiving various grants of lands. He became Chancellor, which office he retained till 1498. In June 1497 he opened talks for the surrender of Perkin Warbeck at &#x27;Jenyn Haugh&#x27;. In 1501, in disgrace once more, he was confined to Dumbarton Castle.

==Final weeks==
Angus&#x27;s two eldest sons were killed at the Battle of Flodden in early September 1513. He himself had not been present at the battle. As the Scottish nation was coming to terms with the disastrous defeat, Angus won appointment as one of the councilors of the Queen Regent, Margaret Tudor. Shortly afterwards, by the end of October, he too was dead. His successor to the Earldom of Angus was his grandson, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus.

==Marriages and children==
Angus married twice:

# On 4 March 1468: Elizabeth (d. 1498), daughter of Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd
# In the summer of 1500: Katherine Stirling, daughter of Sir William Stirling of Keir

Janet Kennedy was one of his mistresses.

===Children by first marriage===
== Angus in fiction ==
The earl is an important character in &quot;Chain of Destiny&quot; by Nigel Tranter, set during the reign of James IV of Scotland. He is depicted negatively as an adversary of the king and a friend of the English during his reign.

<text>Dead of Night is a 1945 British supernatural horror anthology film directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, Charles Crichton, Basil Dearden, and Robert Hamer. It stars Mervyn Johns, Googie Withers, Sally Ann Howes, and Michael Redgrave. Produced by Ealing Studios, the film features five segments within a frame narrative during which a group of guests assembled at a country manor who recount stories of their own individual nightmares. It is best remembered for the concluding story featuring Redgrave and an insane ventriloquist&#x27;s malevolent dummy.

Eagle-Lion Films released &quot;Dead of Night&quot; theatrically in the United Kingdom on 9 September 1945. &quot;Dead of Night&quot; is one of the few horror films made in England during the 1940s, as horror films had been banned from production in Britain during World War II. It was also one of the few horror efforts from Ealing Studios, who were primarily known for producing comedies. The film was greatly influential on the horror and anthology film genres, and is regarded by film critics and scholars as a classic.

Both of John Baines&#x27; stories were reused for later films and the ventriloquist dummy episode was adapted into the pilot episode of the long-running CBS radio series &quot;Escape&quot;.

==Plot==
Walter Craig arrives at a country cottage in Kent, where he is greeted by his host Elliot Foley. Craig is an architect whom Foley has invited to his home to consult on some renovations. Upon entering the sitting room of the cottage, Craig tells Foley and his assembled guests that, despite never having met any of them, he has seen them all in a recurring dream.

Craig appears to have no prior personal knowledge of them but is able to predict events in the house before they unfold. Craig partially recalls that something awful will later occur. Dr. van Straaten, a psychologist, tries to persuade Craig that his fears are unfounded. The other guests attempt to test Craig&#x27;s foresight and entertain each other with tales of strange events they experienced or were told about.

Racing car driver Hugh Grainger recalls lying in hospital after an accident. One night, the peripheral noises of the ward cease and the time on his bedside clock changes. He opens the curtains to see that it is daytime, and a horse-drawn hearse is parked outside. The hearse driver calls up, &quot;just room for one inside, sir&quot;. After being discharged from the hospital, Grainger waits for a bus. The bus conductor, who exactly resembles the hearse driver, tells him, &quot;just room for one inside, sir&quot;. Grainger does not board the bus. As it drives away, the bus swerves and plunges down an embankment.

Sally O&#x27;Hara remembers attending a Christmas party at a mansion. During a game of hide-and-seek, Sally hides behind a curtain and is found by Jimmy, who tells her of a murder that once happened in the mansion. She finds a door which leads to a nursery, where she hears a young boy, Francis Kent, weeping. She consoles him and tucks him into bed. When she returns to the main room, she is told Francis Kent was murdered by his sister Constance.

Joan Cortland tells of an incident in which she gave her husband Peter a mirror for his birthday one year. Upon looking into it, he sees himself in a room other than his own. Joan learns that the mirror&#x27;s previous owner, Francis Etherington, killed his wife on a suspicion of adultery, before slitting his own throat in front of the mirror. Peter, too, accuses Joan of being unfaithful and attempts to strangle her, but she breaks the mirror, returning Peter to his normal mental state.

Foley recounts two golfers, George Parratt and Larry Potter, who both fell in love with a woman named Mary Lee. They decide to play a round of golf for Mary&#x27;s hand in marriage. Parratt wins by cheating, and Potter drowns himself in a nearby lake. When he next plays golf, Parratt is interrupted by Potter&#x27;s ghost. Potter demands he give up Mary or else he will continue to haunt him, but finds he has forgotten how to vanish. On the night of Parratt and Mary&#x27;s wedding, Parratt unwittingly causes to vanish, leaving Potter the opportunity to charm Mary.

Dr. van Straaten recollects interviewing ventriloquist Maxwell Frere, who performed with a dummy named Hugo. Upon meeting American ventriloquist Sylvester Kee, Hugo continually speaks about abandoning Frere and working with Kee instead. Frere attempts to silence Hugo, but Hugo bites his hand, drawing blood. Some time later at a hotel bar, Hugo insults a woman, and Frere is blamed. Kee brings Frere and Hugo to Frere&#x27;s hotel room, placing Hugo on Frere&#x27;s bed. The next morning, Frere accuses Kee of stealing Hugo, and finds Hugo in Kee&#x27;s room. He shoots Kee (though not fatally) and is arrested. Van Straaten arranges for Hugo to be brought to Frere&#x27;s cell, where they have an argument that ends in Frere suffocating and smashing Hugo. Later, in an asylum, Frere speaks with Hugo&#x27;s voice.

In the country home, Craig strangles Dr. van Straaten. Craig then hallucinates about the stories told by the other guests, before awakening in his bedroom as a phone rings. He receives a call from Elliot Foley, inviting him to his country home to consult on some renovations. Craig&#x27;s wife suggests that spending a weekend in the country might help him get rid of his nightmares. Craig then drives up to Foley&#x27;s cottage in Kent as in the start of the film.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Hearse Driver&quot; is based on the short story &quot;The Bus-Conductor&quot; by E. F. Benson, which was originally published in &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot; in 1906.

&quot;The Christmas Party&quot; is based on the 1860 murder of Francis Saville Kent, for which his half-sister Constance Kent was convicted in 1865.

&quot;The Golfer&#x27;s Story&quot; is based on the short story on &quot;The Story of the Inexperienced Ghost&quot; by H. G. Wells. The characters of Parratt and Potter, as portrayed by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne in the segment, are derivative of the characters Charters and Caldicott from Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938). The double-act proved to be popular enough for Radford and Wayne to be paired up as similar sport-obsessed English gentlemen (or occasionally reprising their original roles) in a number of productions, including this one.

==Release==
The film opened at the Gaumont Haymarket cinema in London on 9 September 1945.

Universal Pictures distributed the film theatrically in the United States in a truncated cut that excised two segments: &quot;The Christmas Party&quot; and &quot;The Golfer&#x27;s Story&quot;, which resulted in the final product suffering continuity errors.

===Home media===
Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2003 in a double feature paired with &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1949). In 2014, StudioCanal released the film on Blu-ray as part of their Vintage Classics series. Kino Lorber released a Blu-ray edition of the film in North America, licenesed by StudioCanal, on 9 July 2019, featuring a new 4K restoration from the original film elements.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film performed well at the British box office in 1945. The &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office in 1945 Britain was &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot;, with &quot;runners up&quot; being (in release order), &quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot;, &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;, &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot;, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot;, &quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot;, &quot;They Were Sisters&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Susan&quot;, &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Skefflington&quot;, &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot;, &quot;Nob Hill&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot;, &quot;Conflict&quot; and &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. British &quot;runners-up&quot; were &quot;They Were Sisters&quot;, &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Madonna of the Seven Moons&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, &quot;Waltz Time&quot; and &quot;Henry V.

===Critical response===
From a contemporary review, the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised the tale of the ventriloquist, stating that it was &quot;perhaps the best&quot; and that it was perhaps Cavalcanti&#x27;s &quot;most polished work for many years&quot;. The review praised Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne for &quot;providing excellent comic relief&quot;, and concluded that the art direction (Michael Relph), lighting (Stan Pavey and Douglas Slocombe) and editing (Charles Hassey) combine to make the smoothest film yet to come from an English studio&quot;. Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 4 out of a possible 4 stars.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93% based on , with a rating average of 8.22/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With four accomplished directors contributing, &quot;Dead of Night&quot; is a classic horror anthology that remains highly influential.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Dead of Night&quot; has widely been regarded as a classic film and one of the greatest horror films of all time, as well as significantly influential on the anthology film genre. In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. &quot;Dead of Night&quot; placed at number 35 on their top 100 list. Director Martin Scorsese placed &quot;Dead of Night&quot; 5th on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Writer-director Christopher Smith was inspired by the circular narrative in &quot;Dead of Night&quot; when making his 2009 film &quot;Triangle.&quot;

The circular plot of &quot;Dead of Night&quot; inspired Fred Hoyle&#x27;s steady state model of the universe, developed in 1948. After Hoyle, Hermann Bondi, and Thomas Gold viewed the film, Gold speculated, &quot;What if the universe is like that?&quot;, referring its circular plot. Hoyle initially rejected the idea, saying, &quot;we will dispose of this before dinner&quot;, but as the three astrophysicists discussed it further, they found it difficult to dismiss. Bondi later wrote &quot;Dinner was a little late that night, and before long we all said that this was a very possible solution.&quot;

A shot of Redgrave from the film is featured on the cover of &quot;Merrie Land&quot;, an album by The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen.

<doc id="1129309" wikidata="Q633149" url="?curid=1129309" title="Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus">
<text>Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (c. 148922 January 1557) was a Scottish nobleman active during the reigns of James V and Mary, Queen of Scots. He was the son of George, Master of Angus, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden, and succeeded as Earl of Angus on the death of his grandfather, Archibald.

Through his daughter, Margaret, he was the grandfather of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and therefore the great-grandfather of James VI and I.

==Marriage to Margaret Tudor==
In 1509, Douglas married Margaret Hepburn, daughter of the Earl of Bothwell. After her death, and that of his father, in 1513, on 6 August 1514 the new Earl of Angus married the dowager queen and regent, Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV, mother of two-year-old James V, and elder sister of Henry VIII of England. The marriage stirred up the jealousy of the nobles and the opposition of the faction supporting French influence in Scotland. Civil war broke out, and Margaret lost the regency to John Stewart, Duke of Albany.

Angus withdrew to his estates in Forfarshire, while Albany besieged the queen at Stirling and got possession of the royal children; then he joined Margaret after her flight at Morpeth, and on her departure for London, returned and made his peace with Albany in 1516. He met her once more at Berwick in June 1517, when Margaret returned to Scotland on Albany&#x27;s departure in vain hopes of regaining the regency. Meanwhile, during Margaret&#x27;s absence, Angus had become involved with a daughter of the Laird of Traquair. Angus had a daughter named Lady Janet Douglas with Lady Jane of Traquair and seized some property belonging to his then wife, Margaret Tudor, an estate at Newark and proceeded to live in it openly with his wife and illegitimate child. Margaret, however, was more annoyed with Douglas over his seizure and usage of her dower income as dowager queen of Scotland than the birth of his illegitimate daughter.

Margaret avenged his neglect by refusing to support his claims for power and by secretly trying through Albany to get a divorce. In Edinburgh, Angus held his own against the attempts of the Earl of Arran, to dislodge him. But the return of Albany in 1521, with whom Margaret now sided against her husband, deprived him of power. The regent took the government into his own hands, Angus was charged with high treason in December and in March 1522 was sent practically a prisoner to France, whence he succeeded in escaping to London in 1524.

==Lord of the Articles==
He returned to Scotland in November with promises of support from Henry VIII, with whom he made a close alliance. Margaret, however, refused to have anything to do with her husband. On the 23rd, therefore, Angus forced his way into Edinburgh, but was fired upon by Margaret and retreated to Tantallon Castle.

He now organized a large party of nobles against Margaret with the support of Henry VIII, and, in February 1525, they entered Edinburgh and called a parliament. Angus was made a Lord of the Articles, was included in the Council of regency, bore the king&#x27;s crown on the opening of the session, and with Archbishop Beaton held the chief power.

==Treaty of Berwick (1526)==
Angus was appointed Lord Warden of the Marches in 1526, and suppressed the disorder and anarchy on the border. He had contracted a treaty for three years of peace with England on 10 October 1525 at Berwick upon Tweed, but was unable to return to Berwick to exchange papers as arranged on 13 January 1526 because he had to deal with his political opponents at Linlithgow. Instead, he sent a delegation of commissioners including Adam Otterburn to Berwick to conclude the treaty.

The terms of the treaty included abstinence from war, safe-conducts for legitimate travellers, redress for cross-border robbery and rendition of criminals. Trade by sea was assured according to the previous treaty made by Edward IV and James III in 1464. Among the provisions was the traditional clause, that neither side should dismantle or rebuild the &quot;fishgarth&quot;, where the River Esk meets the Solway. A new clause addressed the issue of border people robbing trees and timber from across the marches. It was hoped that during the three years Scottish commissioners would come to London to negotiate a new treaty of Perpetual Peace. Henry VIII signed on 17 August.

==King&#x27;s keeper==
In July 1526 the guardianship of the King James V was entrusted to him for a fixed period till 1 November, but he refused at its close to retire, and advancing to Linlithgow put to flight Margaret and his opponents.

He now with his followers engrossed all the power, succeeded in gaining over some of his antagonists, including Arran and the Hamiltons, and filled the public offices with Douglases, he himself becoming Chancellor. According to the chronicle of Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, &quot;None that time durst strive against a Douglas nor Douglas&#x27;s man&quot;.

==Counsel of King James==
The young king James V, now fourteen, was far from content under the tutelage of Angus, but he was closely guarded, and several attempts to free him were foiled. Angus defeated John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, who had advanced towards Edinburgh with 10,000 men in August at the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge, and he subsequently took Stirling. After his military successes, he reconciled with Beaton, and in 1527 and 1528 was busy in restoring order through the country.

On 11 March 1528, Margaret succeeded in obtaining her divorce from Angus, and about the end of the month she and her lover, Henry Stewart, were besieged at Stirling. A few weeks later, however, James escaped from Angus&#x27;s custody, took refuge with Margaret and Arran at Stirling, and immediately took revenge by proscribing Angus and all the Douglases, forbidding them to come within seven miles of his person.

This did not include his half-sister, Margaret, who James, even at sixteen, could see was innocent and was allowed to be with them - though, as she was in England, the twosome would never actually meet.

==Alliance with and exile in England==
Angus, having fortified Tantallon, was attainted and his lands confiscated. Repeated attempts by James to subdue the fortress by siege failed, and on one occasion Angus&#x27;s men captured the royal artillery. Angus based himself at Coldingham Priory. At length, Tantallon was given up as a condition of a truce between England and Scotland, and in May 1529, he sought refuge with his brother-in-law, Henry VIII in England. He obtained a pension and took an oath of allegiance, with Henry&#x27;s promise to make his restoration a condition of peace.

Angus had been largely guided in his intrigues with England by his brother, Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, Master of Angus, (died 1552), a far more clever diplomat than himself. George&#x27;s life and lands were also declared forfeit, as were those of his uncle, Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie (died 1535), known by the nickname of &quot;Greysteil&quot;, who had been a friend of King James. These men fled into exile.

James avenged himself on such Douglases remaining in Scotland as he could. Angus&#x27;s third sister Janet, Lady Glamis, was summoned to answer a charge of communicating with her brothers, and when she failed to appear, her estates were forfeited. In 1537, she was tried for conspiring against the king&#x27;s life. She was found guilty and burnt on the Castle Hill, Edinburgh on 17 July 1537. Her innocence has been generally assumed, but the historian Patrick Fraser Tytler considered her guilty. In 1540, James Hamilton of Finnart was executed for conspiring with the Douglases to assassinate James in 1528.

Angus remained in England until 1542, joining in the attacks upon his countrymen on the border, while James refused all demands from Henry VIII for his restoration, and kept firm to his policy of suppressing the Douglas faction. However, despite his remaining in England and the fact that he was her father, Henry VIII kept guardianship of Douglas&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, who was raised in the royal household.

==Return to Scotland==
On James V&#x27;s death in 1542, Angus returned to Scotland, with instructions from Henry to negotiate a marriage between Mary, Queen of Scots, and Edward VI. His forfeiture was rescinded, his estates restored and he was made a privy councillor and lieutenant-general.

In 1543, he successfully negotiated a peace treaty and the marriage, and the same year he married Margaret, daughter of Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell. Shortly afterwards, a struggle between Angus and the regent Arran broke out, and in April 1544 Angus was captured and imprisoned in Blackness Castle.

==Break with England==
The same year Lord Hertford&#x27;s marauding expedition, which did not spare the lands of Angus, made him join the anti-English party. Angus was released from ward when Hertford&#x27;s army landed at Granton near Edinburgh. Angus made a bond with Arran and others to maintain their allegiance to Mary, and gave his support to the mission sent to France to offer the latter&#x27;s hand to the Dauphin. In July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the south of Scotland, and distinguished himself on 27 February 1545 in the victory over the English at Ancrum Moor. Following this victory, Angus was invested with the insignia of a Knight of the Order of St Michael by Francis II of France.

He still corresponded with Henry VIII, but nevertheless signed in 1546 the act cancelling the marriage and peace treaty, and on 10 September 1547 commanded the van in the great defeat of Scotland at Pinkie, when he again won fame. Early in October 1547, Angus tried to recapture the island of Inchcolm from the English with five ships. However, he kept up a secret correspondence with Andrew Dudley, the English commander at Broughty Castle, and wrote that he had made excuses to Regent Arran and prevented his retainers from joining the siege of Broughty.

In February 1548 an attempt to capture him and punish him for his duplicity failed. His son-in-law, the Earl of Lennox, and the English border warden Thomas Wharton marched from Dumfries to intercept Angus at Drumlanrig Castle. Angus surprised and cut off a part of the force led by Wharton&#x27;s son Henry while they were burning Durisdeer. Wharton claimed that when his forces were reunited they killed 500 men, some drowned in the Nith. Meanwhile, his stores at Dumfries were robbed and spoiled, and he was driven back to Annan and back to Carlisle.

Angus escaped his English would-be captors again after the capture of Dalkeith Palace by Grey of Wilton in June 1548. He sailed from Tantallon Castle to Edinburgh, while George Douglas of Pittendreich escaped by a secret way with only a single companion.

==Death==
Under the regency of queen Mary of Guise his restless and ambitious character and the number of his retainers gave cause for frequent alarms to the government. On 31 August 1547 he resigned his earldom, obtaining a re-grant, &quot;sibi et suis haeredibus masculis et suis assignatis quibuscumque&quot; (&quot;to him and his male heirs and their assignees&quot;).

His career was a long struggle for power and for the interests of his family, to which national considerations were completely subordinate. He died in January 1557
at Tantallon Castle, Scotland, from erysipelas. He was buried at Abernethy, Perthshire, Scotland.

==Children and royal grandchild==
By Margaret Tudor he had Margaret, his only surviving legitimate child, who married Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, and was the mother of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley who was the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Angus outlived his illegitimate daughter Janet Douglas who died around 1552. Janet had married Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven and produced several children and the main Ruthven line. Angus also had an illegitimate son George Douglas, who became Bishop of Moray.

Since his only legitimate son, James Douglas, by his wife Margaret Maxwell died young, he was succeeded by his nephew David, the son of George Douglas of Pittendreich.

==In popular culture==
* Angus is the subject of the ballad, &quot;Archibald Douglas&quot;, written by Theodor Fontane in 1854, and most famously sung by Carl Loewe.
* He is played by Andrew Rothney in the TV miniseries &quot;The Spanish Princess.&quot;

<text>Glycyrrhiza lepidota (American licorice) is a species of &quot;Glycyrrhiza&quot; (a genus in the pea/bean family, Fabaceae) native to most of North America, from central Canada south through the United States to California, Texas and Virginia, but absent from the southeastern states. It is also sometimes known in the United States as &quot;wild licorice&quot;, to distinguish it from the related European licorice (&quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot;) which is occasionally cultivated.

The plant grows in moist soils; although it will grow in heavy soil it prefers sandy soil. It grows to tall, and has long tough brown roots which are said to be sweet and were used as food and for medicinal purposes by Native Americans. After eating a roasted root in 1806, Meriwether Lewis described an &quot;agreeable flavor not unlike the sweet pittaitoe (sweet potato).&quot;

American licorice is not sweet from sugar but from glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin may increase blood pressure (aka hypertension) by interfering with cortisol conversion. The Zuni people chew the root to keep the mouth sweet and moist.

American licorice is grazed by cattle, but not preferred and will increase under grazing as competing plants are grazed off. The new growth can be toxic. It has light green to white flowers in the spring which ripen in the fall to clusters of burs which contain pods of small bean-like seeds.

It can be used as a pioneer species to revegetate bare or disturbed ground and is often the first species to invade a receding alkali flat.

There is a market for American licorice root both for medicinal uses and flavoring; also the sweetening of tobacco products.

<text>Carradale (, ) is a village on the east side of the Kintyre Peninsula, overlooking the Kilbrannan Sound and the west coast of the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde, approximately from Campbeltown. To the north of Carradale is the coastal peak known as Torr Mor; nearby are the hamlet of Dippen and Dippen Bay. Population: 577 ~ 2024

==History==
There is a vitrified Iron Age fort at Carradale Point.

In the 17th and 18th centuries there were small communities of crofters and fishermen working in and around Carradale. The introduction of steam ships transformed Kintyre and from the 1830s until the Second World War daily steamers went from Campbeltown to Glasgow, calling at Carradale.

With the herring industry thriving, Carradale&#x27;s first pier was built in 1858, developing and encouraging the holiday trade. This situation persisted until the Second World War, with hotels developing and a tradition of families returning year after year. Now this situation is reversing again. Carradale still has a fishing fleet, largely dealing in shellfish. Since the 1950s, forestry has also played an important part in the village with large scale afforestation taking place.

The Free Church was opened on 2 December 1887.

The novelist and poet Naomi Mitchison lived in Carradale House from 1938 until her death in 1999.

Suffragette Flora Drummond, who was raised on Arran, lived in Carradale from 1944 until her death in 1949.

==Segments of the village==
The village has five main areas:

*Carradale Village, situated at a crossroads formed by the junction of the B842 and B879 roads.
*Carradale Bay, site of a large caravan park overlooking an expanse of white sand.
*Carradale Harbour (and the surrounding area), situated at the end of the B879.
*Port Righ Bay, overlooking a small sheltered beach.
*Waterfoot, at the mouth of the Carradale River.

==Transport==

The only public transport available to Carradale is a bus service operated by West Coast Motors, to and from Campbeltown via Peninver, and Saddell.

<text>Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus and 5th Earl of Morton (15554 August 1588) was a Scottish aristocrat.

==Family background==
He was the son of David, 7th Earl of Angus. He succeeded to the title and estates in 1558, being brought up by his uncle, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, a Presbyterian. 

==Life==
Archibald Douglas was educated at the University of St Andrews and was tutored at Regent Morton&#x27;s court by John Provan.

In 1573 he was made a Privy Councillor and Sheriff of Berwickshire; in 1574 Lieutenant-General in Scotland; in 1577 Warden of the West Marches and Steward of Fife; and in 1578 Lieutenant-General of the realm. As a supporter of Morton and &quot;ultra-Protestant&quot; policy he was twice forced in exile in England.

In 1580 Angus gave strong support to Morton during the attack upon the latter, made a vain attempt to rescue him, and was declared guilty of high treason on 2 June 1581. He then entered into correspondence with the English government for an invasion of Scotland to rescue Morton, and on the latter&#x27;s execution in June, went in exile to London, where he was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth.

After the Raid of Ruthven in 1582, Angus returned to Scotland and was reconciled to King James, but soon afterwards the king shook off the control of the Earls of Mar and Gowrie, and Angus was again banished from Court.

In 1584 he joined the rebellion of Mar and Glamis. Their supporters held Stirling Castle and Mar&#x27;s Wark in April. The movement failed, and the insurgents fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Later they took up residence at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which became a centre of Presbyterianism and of projects against the Scottish government, encouraged by Elizabeth, who regarded the banished lords as friends of the English and antagonists of the French interest.

In February 1585 they came to London and cleared themselves of the accusation of plotting against James&#x27;s life. A plan was then prepared for their restoration and for the overthrow of James Stewart, Earl of Arran. In October they invaded Scotland and gained an easy victory over Arran, captured Stirling Castle with the King in November, and secured from him the restoration of their estates and the control of the government.

His Edinburgh residence lay off the Canongate, on its north side, close to where New Street now lies.

In January 1586 he was granted the Earldom of Morton with the lands entailed upon him by his uncle; this made him 5th Earl of Morton. In November 1586 Angus was appointed Warden of the Marches and Lieutenant-General on the Border, with a force of 100 horsemen and 100 foot soldiers, and their officers, drummers and pipers, and &quot;furriers&quot; or quartermasters.

He performed good services in restoring order; but he was unable to overcome the king&#x27;s hostility to the establishment of Presbyterian government.

==Death==
In July 1588 it was reported that he had travelled from the west of Scotland &quot;sick of the flux and burning ague.&quot; He died on 4 August 1588 at Smeaton, near Dalkeith Palace. He was said to have been buried at Aberdour in Fife, but more likely, he was buried at Abernethy.

As reported in the &quot;Newes from Scotland&quot; tract of 1591, his death was said to have been caused by witchcraft. His physician found his illness strange and there was no cure or remedy, causing him to languish until his death. During the North Berwick witch trials, Geillis Duncan accused Barbara Napier of causing his death by witchcraft. Euphame MacCalzean, Agnes Sampson, and Richard Grierson were also accused. The Earl of Bothwell admitted that he had sent the cunning man Richie Graham to attend the earl.

==Family==
The Earl of Angus was married three times: (1) on 13 June 1573 at the Church of the Holy Rude, Mary Erskine, a daughter of the Earl of Mar and Annabell Murray. Her &quot;tocher&quot; or dowry was 8,000 merks; (2) 25 December 1575 at Cupar, (divorced 1587) Margaret, a daughter of George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes; (3) 29 July 1587 Jean Lyon, a daughter of John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis, with whom he had a daughter Margaret, who died unmarried aged 15.

Angus began proceedings to divorce Margaret Leslie in August 1586, which were strongly opposed by the Earl of Rothes who considered he had been Angus&#x27;s ally during his banishment. A French diplomat in Edinburgh, Camille de Preau, sieur de Courcelles, heard that Angus claimed she had flirted with a stableboy, which was thought unlikely, and the Earl of Bothwell joked he would divorce his wife Margaret Douglas for the same. She was Angus&#x27;s sister.

He was succeeded in the Earldom of Angus by his cousin William, a descendant of the 5th earl.

A closer line of the Douglas family to the former Earls of Morton inherited the Earldom of Morton. For the Morton title, see James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton and William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton.

<text>The Project 633 class (known in the West by its NATO reporting name as the Romeo class) is a class of Soviet diesel-electric submarine, built between 1957 and 1961. A Chinese variant, Type 033, was built in China from 1962 to 1984.

== Project 633 ==
Project 633 was a further development of the Soviet navy&#x27;s post-war 611 (Zulu-) and 613 (Whiskey-class) designs, which themselves were derivatives of the German Kriegsmarine Type XXI submarine. The project was undertaken by Lazurit Central Design Bureau of Gorky.

Only 20 of the Soviet Union&#x27;s originally intended 56 were completed between October 1957 and the end of December 1961 because of the introduction of the nuclear submarine into the Soviet Navy.

By today&#x27;s standards Romeo class submarines are considered obsolete, but they still have some value as training and surveillance vessels.

==Chinese Type 033 Romeo class and its variants==

Under the 1950 Sino-Soviet Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviets passed to China (and later to North Korea) the documentation necessary to produce Romeo submarines in 1963. The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries.

The Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, Sonar on board was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo-class submarine variants were developed:

*Type 6633: Original Chinese built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, six were planned, but only two were completed. The construction program stopped when the USSR stopped delivery of parts following the Sino-Soviet split. Construction of the third unit at Wuhan was stopped, and available parts were diverted to complete the first pair, but many parts had to be developed indigenously. The primary improvement of Type 6633 over the original Soviet boats is the use of domestic Chinese batteries, which had slightly superior performance to that of the original Soviet batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Type 033/035&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type 033: Complete domestic production in China was achieved in 1967, and subsequently the project was renamed the Type 033. However, experience from deployment of completed boats in warmer climates proved that the original Soviet refrigeration and air conditioning system designed for subarctic and arctic area was woefully inadequate for subtropical and tropical regions, so redesigns were needed to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and all boats to be stationed in tropical and subtropical regions went through such a refit. In September 1969 construction of new Type 033s, with improved air conditioning and refrigeration capability, began at Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, eventually, 13 units were completed.
*ES5A: Upgraded Type 033, with improvements mainly involving the replacement of equipment of Soviet origin with domestic Chinese systems, which includes: QZHA―10 (Type 779) attack periscope and QDYA―10 (Type 778) general purpose periscope. Addition of H/SQG-2 ranging sonar, Type 063 communication systems, and countermeasure systems. Domestic Chinese Type 801 sonar replaced the original Soviet MARS-24 sonar. The only difference between the Type 801 sonar and the MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for the Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy. Domestic Chinese H/SQZ-D reconnaissance sonar (with Type 105 transducers) replaced the original Soviet system, the performance of the SQZ-D is almost identical to the original Soviet sonar it was developed from, except for the sector of scan, which is increased by 15 degrees. Additional noise reduction measures were also adopted. This is the type China originally sold to Egypt in the 1980s.
*Type 033G: Development of the ES5A, with the incorporation of the capability to launch acoustic homing torpedoes; analog computers installed to achieve automation of, and speeding up of, torpedo fire control calculations that were previously manually calculated. All Chinese Romeos were converted to this standard. The NATO reporting name for this type is rumored to be the Wuhan class.
*Type 033G1: A single Type 033G was modified to carry 6 YJ-1 (CSS-N-4) anti-ship missiles, this variant is called Type 033G1, with the rumored NATO reporting name of Wuhan A. The missile had to be fired while the boat was surfaced, with a total exposure time on the surface of less than 7 minutes. The most significant improvement, however, is the reduction of noise level by 12 dB.
*ES5B: Development of the Type 033G, primarily intended for export. This is an upgrade package for Romeo submarine users. The primary improvement of this class is the ability to launch wire guided torpedoes and anti-ship missiles (AShM) while submerged. The program originally began in the mid-1980s, and Egypt was reported to be the only customer when China won a contract to upgrade its Romeo-class submarine fleet, including both Soviet built and Chinese built units. This is the last type of Chinese Romeo class submarine; with noise reduction of 20 dB to 140 dB in comparison to the 160 dB of the original Soviet Project 633 submarines acquired by China.

==Operators==

===Current===

Currently four countries are using Romeo class submarines in an operational capacity:
* operates 20 Romeo class submarines. Seven were directly imported from China between 1973 and 1975, and the remainder locally assembled with Chinese supplied parts between 1976 and 1995. One apparently sank in an accident in 1985. Four Chinese imported units are based on the western coast.
* operates four of an original eight Romeo class submarines that are upgraded variants of the Chinese design.
Currently using Romeo class submarines in non-operational capacities (i.e. training):
* and the Soviet Union had 20 Romeo class vessels in service. These vessels are no longer used as combat vessels in the Russian Navy, although one or two remain in service as immobile training facilities.
* has operated an estimated 84 of the Type-33 submarine (Romeo) during the Cold War. Most have been scrapped, but 13 are still in use for training.

===Former===

No longer using Romeo class submarines in any reported capacity:
* operated four Romeo class submarines (S-81 &quot;Pobeda&quot;, S-41 &quot;Viktoriya&quot;, S-83 &quot;Nadezhda&quot;, S-84 &quot;Slava&quot;). Decommissioning began in the 1990s and ended in 2011: Pobeda in 1990, Viktoriya in 1992, Nadezhda in 2008, Slava in 2011. All but Slava was scrapped.
* received three Romeo class submarines built in 1961 from the Soviet Navy: S-1, S-53, S-101. All were decommissioned in the mid 1990s and sold for scrap in 1996.
* had two Romeo class ex-Soviet Navy submarines: S-10 and S-11. Delivered in 1982 and in 1983, they were decommissioned in 1989 and scrapped.

<text>John David Herbert (September 8, 1930 – March 27, 2017) was an American lawyer who served two terms as the 40th Ohio State Treasurer from 1963 to 1971.

A Republican, he was the son of Thomas J. Herbert, who was Governor of Ohio from 1947 to 1949.

In 1970, Herbert won the Republican nomination for Ohio Attorney General, but lost because of his connections to the &quot;Crofters&quot; scandal in which Republicans were accused of steering state investments to campaign contributors. The scandal brought down nearly the entire Republican ticket in 1970 and helped to elect John J. Gilligan to a single term as governor.

Herbert was born in Columbus, Ohio. His father was Thomas J. Herbert who served as Governor of Ohio. He graduated from Culver Military Academy. He then graduated from Princeton University and received his law degree from University of Michigan Law School. He served in the United States Army during Korean conflict. Herbert worked in the office of the Ohio Attorney General as an assistant. From 1973 to 1961, Herbert served as the Ohio State Treasurer and was a Republican. He lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. After he left the office of the Ohio State Treasurer, Herbert was corporate counsel to the Ace Doran Hauling and Rigging Company in Cincinnati. Herbert died at his home in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<text>The BBC Symphony Chorus is a British amateur chorus based in London. It is the dedicated chorus for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, though it performs with other national and international orchestras.

==Brief history==
===Background===
In its early years, the BBC worked on developing its choral output, founding the BBC Wireless Chorus, a professional chamber choir of 16, to supply the smaller scale needs. For bigger choral works, the BBC turned to outside organisations, which performed either under their own name, or under the title of &quot;The National Chorus&quot;. Participating choruses included the Civil Service Choir, the Lloyds Choir, and the Railway Clearing House Male Voice Choir, which would perform en masse together with the Wireless Chorus. Holst&#x27;s choral ballet &quot;The Morning of the Year&quot; has the distinction of having been the first piece of music to be commissioned by the music department of the newly formed British Broadcasting Corporation. Its first performance was as part of a concert given at the Royal Albert Hall by the National Chorus and Orchestra, which was broadcast live, on the evening of 17 March 1927.

===Foundation===
By 1928, the BBC had decided there was a need to develop a large amateur chorus of its own. Notices advertising the formation of The National Chorus were placed, auditions were held, a broadcast was delivered in August 1928 discussing the new choir and its upcoming programme, and the choir gave its first performance later that year in Granville Bantock&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Stanford Robinson, already on the BBC&#x27;s staff, was appointed Conductor. A condition of singing in the new choir was that the new member must already be a member of an existing choir.
Its earliest concerts included the UK premiere of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Eighth Symphony&quot; (15 April 1930, under Sir Henry Wood), Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; (17 December 1930), the London premiere of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (25 November 1931, under Adrian Boult) and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; (27 January 1932, under Ernest Ansermet). The &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; under the baton of Herman Scherchen on 17 December 1930 was the first performance of the Chorus with the new BBC Symphony Orchestra. Outstanding events in the following years included the premiere of &quot;Morning Heroes&quot; by Bliss, on 25 March 1931; and the British premiere of Hindemith’s oratorio &quot;Das Unaufhörliche&quot;, which Wood conducted on 22 March 1933. Also noted are performances under such conductors as Adrian Boult, Arturo Toscanini and Bruno Walter.

In 1932, Stanford Robinson was transferred to the BBC Theatre Orchestra, which he conducted for many years. He was succeeded briefly by Cyril Dalmaine, who took over in July 1932. In his autobiography, written under the pseudonym Jonah Barrington, Dalmaine said his appointment &#x27;typifies one of the early weaknesses in BBC administration – the allocating of jobs to the lowest bidder&#x27;. It was plain that Dalmaine was not ideally suited to the job, and within two years he left the BBC, a victim (as he put it) of &#x27;the BBC’s absorbed and all-pervading interest in man’s relations with woman&#x27; which was ‘at that time proverbial’.

The choir&#x27;s name was changed in 1932 to The BBC Chorus, and again in 1935 to become the BBC Choral Society when a professional choir named the BBC Chorus was established. Leslie Woodgate held the post of chorus master from 1934 until he died in 1961. He was wholly dedicated to the work of preparing the Society for the many arduous engagements it undertook, and raised the choir from the position of being, as Sir Henry Coward told Woodgate in 1936, &#x27;nearly as good as my Yorkshire choir&#x27; to being at least as good as the great, long-established choral societies of the north. Important performances of new works continued: on 11 April 1934 there was Holst&#x27;s &quot;First Choral Symphony&quot; (which had been premiered in Leeds Town Hall in 1925), and on 28 November 1934 the British premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Perséphone&quot;. In January 1935 Albert Coates conducted one of the Thirties’ curiosities: the Symphony in C minor by Yuri Shaporin. The BBC Choral Society took part in Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Cantata Profana&quot; on 25 March 1936 under Boult; the London premiere of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Five Tudor Portraits&quot; on 27 January 1937; and, perhaps most remarkable of all, the British premiere of Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, which took place on 17 March 1937.

In 1939, Leslie Woodgate described the operation and function of the various BBC choirs, including the Choral Society, in an interview with &quot;The Musical Times&quot;. Under Leslie Woodgate, the Choral Society achieved maturity; and all accounts of the period agree that the occasions which marked that maturity were the concerts given at the end of the 1930s under the direction of Arturo Toscanini. When Toscanini was first persuaded to come to England, he would not consider working with an amateur chorus, but eventually he accepted the challenge of a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, Op. 125 (the &quot;Choral&quot;) on 3 November 1937 with the BBC Choral Society. The Verdi Requiem on 27 May 1938 and Beethoven&#x27;s Mass in D, Op. 123 (the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;) on 26 May 1939 were both performed under his direction in the following two years, in a series of concerts in the BBC&#x27;s London Music Festival, which were the highlights of the capital&#x27;s musical life in the pre-war years.

===Second World War===
The Second World War interrupted the activities of the BBC Choral Society as it did many other artistic ventures. The outbreak of war saw the evacuation of the BBC Symphony Orchestra to Bristol, and then (when that became intolerable because of air-raids) to Bedford. This led to the abandonment of the activities of the Society.

In August 1942, in war-time London, an entirely fortuitous meeting near the Albert Memorial took place between the Chorus Master Leslie Woodgate and Honorary Secretary, and the restarting of the Society was discussed. Dr R. S. Thatcher, the Assistant Director of Music at the BBC, became interested, and a meeting was called in December 1942, at which it was agreed that the chorus should not remain inactive, but that it should resume rehearsals. On the first Friday of January 1943, about one hundred members assembled for the first of the war-time rehearsals.

These Friday rehearsals were an ideal tonic for the members, and undoubtedly helped them very much in carrying on their arduous war-time labours. To Leslie Woodgate, already overburdened with work, they must have seemed almost the last straw, as he frequently had to travel long distances in order to conduct them. The members, indeed, owe him a debt of gratitude for his efforts during those trying times.

Then came the flying bombs. Rehearsals stopped, but after about six weeks it was decided to resume. During that period four of the members lost their lives.

===Postwar===
After the war, activities began again in earnest. Yuri Shaporin&#x27;s &quot;On the Field of Kulikovo&quot; was another of the Russian works undertaken by the chorus in this period, on 7 November 1945, conducted by Albert Coates. To mark the 21st birthday of the BBC Choral Society in 1949, several special events took place, among them the first performance in London of a work by Leslie Woodgate, his oratorio &quot;Simon Peter&quot;. The following year, Adrian Boult, who had conducted many of the performances in the 1930s and 1940s as the BBC&#x27;s Director of Music and Chief Conductor, reached retiring age and was not asked to remain with the corporation. In 1950 the post of Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra was given to Malcolm Sargent, and there began an era in which the performance of the great choral works became a particular feature of BBC concerts.

Sargent was especially devoted to choral music. His special skills with singers were well described by Bernard Shore (the former principal viola of the BBC Symphony Orchestra) in his book &quot;The Orchestra Speaks&quot;: &#x27;He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see the eyes of a choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets, to understand what he means to them. He is hypnotic with the choir – he plays upon the imagination and minds of the singers like a mesmerist.&#x27; Under Sargent the emphasis in the Society&#x27;s repertoire shifted from adventurous new continental works to the 20th-century compositions of British composers: Herbert Howells&#x27;s &quot;Hymnus Paradisi&quot;, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sea Symphony&quot;, Delius&#x27;s &quot;Sea Drift&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s &quot;These things shall be&quot;, along with the classics of the choral repertory such as Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth and the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. Premieres were fewer than before: significant works included &quot;Golgotha&quot; by Frank Martin and Hodie by Vaughan Williams. Important events included the ceremonial opening of the new Royal Festival Hall in 1951 (with a concert of English music by Thomas Arne, Handel and Hubert Parry) and a memorial concert for King George VI (&quot;Messiah&quot; with the Royal Choral Society).

While Leslie Woodgate continued to be Chorus Master of the BBC Choral Society, Sargent was succeeded as Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra by Rudolf Schwarz. This took place in 1957; Sargent continued to conduct the Society on many occasions (particularly at the Proms), but a change in direction was immediately apparent with the inclusion in programmes of such new works as &quot;The Bermudas&quot; by lain Hamilton (on 30 October 1957) and such (then) rare works as Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespers of 1610 &quot; (on 20 October 1958). Schwarz also conducted &quot;Ulysses&quot; by Matyas Seiber for two concerts in December 1957. In 1958 the BBC Choral Society under Leslie Woodgate travelled to Aachen, where they gave an &quot;a cappella&quot; concert including Britten&#x27;s Hymn to St Cecilia, and then went on to the Herkulesaal in Munich, where Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was performed.

===1960s===
The arrival of William Glock at the BBC as Controller, Music, in 1959, had the same revolutionary effect on the BBC Choral Society as on every other department concerned with music. In addition, the Society suffered a sudden loss in 1961 with the death of Leslie Woodgate, who had guided it through 27 years of its existence. On 15 June 1961, a memorial concert was held, directed by Keith Falkner (who had been a soloist in the first concert in 1928) and by George Thalben-Ball. Peter Gellhorn took over the post of Chorus Master, which he held for some eleven years until 1972. Under the Glock regime new works began to re-assume a vital part in the Society&#x27;s repertoire. On 1 August 1963 the London premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; (first performed the preceding year at Coventry Cathedral) was given, with Britten and Meredith Davies conducting. Later that year Alan Rawsthorne&#x27;s &quot;Carmen Vitale&quot; was a choral commission; and at the beginning of 1963 the Society faced one of its greatest challenges, a new work by Hans Werner Henze called &quot;Novae de Infinito Laudes&quot;. This was given two performances under the composer&#x27;s direction: on 17 March 1965, and again at the Proms on 27 August. Distinguished visitors in this period included Leopold Stokowski (in Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony). A return visit by Ernest Ansermet to conduct Honegger&#x27;s &quot;King David&quot; had been planned to mark the 10th anniversary of Honegger&#x27;s death, but Ansermet was ill and Sir Adrian Boult took over at short notice.

In what he described as &#x27;an act of faith&#x27;, Glock promoted in 1967 the first performance in England of the St Luke Passion by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki – a modern re-working of the traditional large-scale Passion setting which made exceptional demands on the choir. The occasion was a great success, and was repeated in the Proms on 2 August 1967. A typical example of the extraordinary demands made on the chorus during the Proms each year was the succession of works performed during that season: in addition to the Penderecki, Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony, Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot;, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Grande Messe des Morts&quot;, Delius&#x27;s &quot;Appalachia&quot;, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s E flat Mass and Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth were all sung.

Under Antal Dorati, Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1963 to 1967, the BBC Choral Society sang Mahler, a great deal of Stravinsky, some Britten, and much Beethoven. When Colin Davis took over in 1967, a new group of composers came to the fore: Berlioz, Liszt (the Dante Symphony as well as the Faust Symphony), and Michael Tippett. This last connection brought the BBC Choral Society its opportunity to make its first recording for a commercial company in recent years (though Mendelssohn&#x27;s Elijah had been recorded as long ago as 1930): Tippett&#x27;s oratorio A Child of Our Time was recorded under Davis&#x27;s direction for Philips Classics Records. There followed a succession of major contemporary works: &quot;Voices of Night&quot; by Franz Reizenstein in 1969; La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ by Messiaen at the first night of the Proms in 1970; and the &quot;Requiem&quot; by Gyorgy Ligeti in 1971.

===1970s===
In 1971, Colin Davis departed to take up the post of Music Director at Covent Garden, and was succeeded by the composer and conductor Pierre Boulez. There was also a change of chorus master: in 1972 Peter Gellhorn was succeeded by John Poole, who directed several of the concerts in this period, including Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot; and Bruckner&#x27;s F minor Mass. The Boulez repertoire, as with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, was immediately distinctive: Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurrelieder&quot; was given several performances, and became a commercial recording for CBS Records. Stravinsky, Ravel, Debussy and Mahler were prominently featured, while of the romantics Berlioz, Schumann (the &quot;Scenes from Goethe&#x27;s Faust&quot;) and Brahms (the &quot;Requiem&quot;) all appeared more than once. During this period the Society sang under many guest conductors: the young Andrew Davis made his unexpected London debut with them in Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot;; Lorin Maazel returned to conduct some highly successful concerts; John Pritchard conducted several events including Rachmaninov&#x27;s &quot;The Bells&quot;; and an increasingly large number of important occasions were undertaken by the Chorus Master, John Poole.

John Poole was entrusted with the world premiere of David Bedford&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Hours of Sunset&quot; in 1975, and at the Alexandra Palace conducted two symphonies by Havergal Brian with the BBC Choral Society (who had already taken part in the giant Gothic Symphony by the same composer in a concert at the Albert Hall). Another first performance, that of Iain Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Epitaph for this world and time&quot;, performed before the traditional Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth on the penultimate night of the Proms in 1975, proved one of the most complex undertakings of the BBC Choral Society, for the choir was split into three groups, and positioned around the arena in the Albert Hall. Both this, and another 1975 contemporary work, &quot;Mortales&quot; by Wilfred Josephs, were conducted by John Poole.

In 1976 the work of the BBC&#x27;s professional choir, the BBC Singers, increased and John Poole gave up his work with the BBC Choral Society in order to concentrate on the BBC Singers&#x27; activities. Brian Wright, then took over as Chorus Master, and in the following year himself conducted the chorus in public in such works as Duruflé&#x27;s Requiem, Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Missa Brevis&quot;, and Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Choral Symphony&quot;.

In 1977, the Chorus adopted its current name of the BBC Symphony Chorus, in recognition of its status as a choir appearing in professional concerts under leading conductors, &quot;with a repertory second to none&quot;. It made its first appearance under that name in the &quot;Sea Symphony&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams on 12 October 1977.

In September and October 1978 the Chorus travelled to the Festival of Flanders, appearing under the baton of the new Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, as well as that of their Chorus Master Brian Wright. They sang the Mass in F minor and motets by Bruckner. Works performed later that same season in 1979 included Thea Musgrave&#x27;s &quot;Five Ages of Man&quot;, Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Vision of St Augustine&quot;, as well as performances in the Royal Albert Hall of the B Minor Mass on 10 January 1979, conducted by Brian Wright, to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Chorus and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Music Makers&quot; on 8 April 1979 to mark the 90th birthday of Sir Adrian Boult.

===1980s===
Specialities such as Britten&#x27;s Spring Symphony and Berlioz&#x27;s The Trojans were added by Gennady Rozhdestvensky, and repertoire from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; to Alexander Goehr’s &quot;Babylon the great is fallen&quot; (in 1983) under Sir John Pritchard, who was principal conductor the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1982 to 1989. Other important premieres in this period included the European premiere of Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Mask of Time&quot; at the 1984 Proms, the first European performance of Roger Sessions&#x27;s &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot; at the 1985 Proms, and the British premiere of Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Polish Requiem&quot; (conducted by the composer) in 1986.

From 1984 to 1988 the director of the BBC Symphony Chorus was Gareth Morrell, who served in that capacity for a wide range of concert and recording projects with conductors such as Sir Colin Davis, Claudio Abbado, Lorin Maazel and Christoph von Dohnányi. With Seiji Ozawa he collaborated in performances of Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s opera &quot;St Francis of Assisi&quot; in London and Berlin, and with Andrew Davis in performances of Sir Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Mask of Time&quot;, the recording of which has been critically acclaimed.

===Stephen Jackson===
The Chorus was directed from 1989 to 2015 by Stephen Jackson. In his time, he prepared a huge repertoire for more than fifty maestri, including Bernard Haitink, Pierre Boulez, Simon Rattle and Roger Norrington, and composer-conductors such as Luciano Berio and John Adams. Jackson regularly conducted the BBC Symphony Chorus himself, in the concert hall, on tour and in the recording studio. He particularly extended the range of the ensemble&#x27;s large-scale &quot;a cappella&quot; choral repertoire, including Rachmaninov&#x27;s &quot;Vespers&quot; (&quot;All-Night Vigil&quot;), Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Friede auf Erden&quot; and Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Figure humaine&quot;; recorded works by Carl Rütti and Judith Bingham; and commissioned works by Richard Rodney Bennett, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Stephen Montague.

The BBC Symphony Chorus celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2003 with a number of concerts in London, and a week of special broadcasts of its most memorable performances of recent years as part of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Performance&quot; (17-21 November 2003) presented by Tommy Pearson. The following works were included:

* Poulenc &quot;Figure Humaine&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, conductor Stephen Jackson 
* Schoenberg &quot;Friede auf Erden&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, conductor Stephen Jackson 
* Holst &quot;A Dirge for Two Veterans&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, Wallace Collection, conductor Stephen Jackson
* Walton &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; Alan Opie (baritone), BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Leonard Slatkin
* Bingham &quot;Salt in the Blood&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, London Gabrieli Brass Ensemble, conductor Stephen Jackson 
* Byrd &quot;Laudibus in Sanctis&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, conductor Stephen Jackson
* Schubert Mass in A flat, D687 Rosa Mannion (soprano), Stella Doufexis (mezzo), Toby Spence (tenor), Nathan Berg (bass), BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Jiri Belohlavek
* Stravinsky &quot;King of the Stars&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Pierre Boulez 
* Bax &quot;Mater Ora Filium&quot; BBC Symphony Chorus, conductor Stephen Jackson 
* MacMillan &quot;Quickening&quot; Hilliard Ensemble, Westminster Cathedral Choristers, BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Andrew Davis
* Elgar &quot;The Music Makers&quot; Jean Rigby (mezzo), BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Andrew Davis
* Rachmaninov &quot;The Bells&quot; Elena Prokina (soprano), Daniil Shtoda (tenor), Sergei Leiferkus (baritone), BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Yevgeni Svetlanov
* Beethoven &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; Karita Mattila (soprano), Catherine Wyn-Rogers (mezzo), Herbert Lippert (tenor), Anthony Michaels Moore (baritone), BBC Singers, BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conductor Bernard Haitink

Stephen Jackson&#x27;s last concert with the BBC Symphony Chorus was part of the Barbican&#x27;s &quot;Sound Unbound&quot; event on Saturday 31 October 2015, and included Judith Bingham&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Truth&quot; and &quot;the Mount Everest of classical choral music: the glorious 40-part motet&quot;, Thomas Tallis&#x27;s &quot;Spem in alium&quot;. This is the only time the BBC Symphony Chorus has performed &quot;Spem in alium&quot; in public.

By the end of his period of tenure, the BBC Symphony Chorus had come to be widely regarded as one of the best amateur choruses in the world, singing some of the hardest pieces in the repertoire, with Stephen Jackson considered one of the world&#x27;s most talented choir trainers, demonstrating &quot;skill, musicianship, encyclopaedic knowledge and fervent passion&quot; for the BBC Symphony Chorus.

===Sir Andrew Davis===
Sir Andrew Davis, conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1989 to 2000, was President of the Chorus until his death in 2024. Appropriately enough, this appointment was announced through the medium of song by Davis himself at the Last Night of the Proms, 2000.

Under Davis, the Chorus performed the major choral works of Elgar; the symphonies of Mahler; Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;; Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Song of the High Hills&quot;; and Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Mask of Time&quot; as well as &quot;The Vision of Saint Augustine&quot;, &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; and &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;.

==Notable events==
===Blue Peter===
The Chorus took part in numerous &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Christmas shows and between 1983 and 2010. The grand finale of the traditional &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Christmas programme comprised the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and children from various schools, assisted by members of the BBC Symphony Chorus, marching &quot;up the hill&quot; and into the studio from the cold outside (lanterns in hand!) singing a Christmas carol around the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Christmas tree. Two carols, &quot;Hark! the Herald Angels Sing&quot; and &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;, were sung in alternate years, except in 1998 when there was a one-off experiment with &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;. However, for the 2007 Christmas programme, leaving budgetary and studio constraints unspoken, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; decided on a change to the Christmas show format to host a party recognising the hard work and effort of young carers, relating to a recent Appeal. This event replaced the carol, and the Chorus was not required. In 2010 the closing carol was reinstated, featuring for one final time the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and members of the BBC Symphony Chorus, the last Christmas show before the programme moved to MediaCityUK.

The Chorus featured occasionally in other editions of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, notably in the programme on Monday 12 March 1984 (edition 1888). To publicise a concert at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, for The Knightsbridge Fund in aid of the victims of the Harrods bombing, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; invited the Chorus to the studio to sing the hymn &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot; (Old Hundredth) conducted by Brian Wright, accompanied by the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band, who had been playing outside Harrods.

Janet Ellis became a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter in 1983. She was asked to audition with Chorus master Gareth Morrell and sing with the Chorus at the Last Night of the Proms on 14 September 1985.

Zöe Salmon was unwrapped from a giant present under the tree as a new presenter in the Christmas 2004 edition of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. Shortly after her debut, she famously said &quot;I’ll try anything once&quot;, which started a trend in her being asked to do dangerous or embarrassing things. Among consequent challenges, a generation on from Janet Ellis she was asked to learn how to sing, to audition with Chorus director Stephen Jackson, to attend piano and orchestral rehearsals in Maida Vale Studios and to sing with the Chorus in the Last Night of the Proms on 10 September 2005.

===Prom at the Palace===
In 2002 the Chorus performed at Buckingham Palace, as part of the Prom at the Palace which marked the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations. The BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, under the baton of Sir Andrew Davis, formed the backbone of the concert, on 1 June 2002. The concert was broadcast live on BBC One television and BBC Radio 3, and released a month later on audio CD (EMI/Virgin Records) and DVD (BBC/Opus Arte).

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh returned the favour by attending a special BBC Proms concert celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Her Majesty&#x27;s Coronation on 30 July 2003. Sir Andrew Davis conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and five massed choirs, including the BBC Symphony Chorus. Sofi Jeannin, future Chief Conductor of the BBC Singers, happened to be a member of the BBC Symphony Chorus at that time.

===&quot;Not the Messiah&quot;===
To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the original Monty Python television programme, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by John du Prez appeared alongside Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam in a remount of &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2009. It was produced by Geoff Foulkes and directed by Aubrey Powell. It was recorded for release for one night only on 25 March 2010 at digital cinemas across the UK and Ireland and distribution on DVD, and BBC Radio 3 also broadcast a recording of this performance on New Year&#x27;s Day 2010.

===&quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;===
The Chorus has performed Elgar’s oratorio, &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, Op. 38, many times since it first performed it at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, on 18 May 1931, conducted by Stanford Robinson.

A performance of the oratorio was given in the sixth-century St Irene&#x27;s Church as part of the 1997 Istanbul International Music Festival. Leonard Slatkin conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with mezzo-soprano Jean Rigby, tenor John Aler and baritone Alan Opie.

A special performance of the oratorio was given from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 26 November 1997 to mark the 75th anniversary of the BBC. Andrew Davis conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with mezzo-soprano Catherine Wyn-Rogers, tenor Philip Langridge and bass Alastair Miles. The concert was broadcast live on BBC Two television and BBC Radio 3, and later released on VHS video (NVC Arts), whereupon it was heralded as &quot;the most convincing modern interpretation of &quot;Gerontius&quot;&quot;, and DVD (Warner Music Vision). &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, 2008, gave its maximum four star rating to this DVD recording of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, rating it as &quot;the finest recorded &quot;Gerontius&quot; ever&quot;.

On 6 April 2014, another performance was given at the Barbican by Sir Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, tenor Stuart Skelton and bass David Soar, following a recording of the work for Chandos Records. The recording was the winner, choral category, in both the BBC Music Magazine Awards 2015, and the Gramophone Classical Music Awards 2015.

&quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; will be performed at the Barbican on 13 December 2024 as a tribute to Sir Andrew Davis, who died in April 2024.

==The Chorus today==
Although normally associated with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Chorus does perform independently. Venues regularly visited include the Barbican Centre and the Royal Albert Hall. As the resident chorus at the BBC Proms, the Symphony Chorus usually performs both on the first and last night. It makes regular recordings for classical music station BBC Radio 3.

New works play a vital part in the life of the Chorus. They try to balance well-known scores with the challenges of newer or more difficult works. Premieres and commissions in recent years have included works by Peter Maxwell Davies, Dame Judith Weir, John Tavener, Hugh Wood and Anthony Payne. The level of the Chorus is widely acknowledged to be exceptional, with works in its repertoire so difficult as sometimes to be inaccessible to professionals. Rehearsals take place twice a week, and the Chorus has very high requirements, with selection being tough.

Neil Ferris was appointed as Chorus Director of the BBC Symphony Chorus from May 2017. Grace Rossiter was appointed as Deputy Chorus Director. The appointment of Helen MacLeod in the new position of Choruses Manager of the BBC Symphony Chorus and the BBC Proms Youth Choir was announced at the same time.

The BBC Symphony Chorus&#x27;s 90th birthday season included concerts featuring Ethel Smyth&#x27;s Mass in D, Berlioz&#x27;s L&#x27;Enfance du Christ and Bach&#x27;s B Minor Mass. Neil Ferris made his BBC Proms conducting debut in August 2019, celebrating the 90th anniversary season of the BBC Symphony Chorus with the premiere of Jonathan Dove’s specially commissioned piece &quot;We Are One Fire&quot;.

The final concert before the halting of the season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in London was Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; (4 March 2020), marking 250 years since the year of Beethoven&#x27;s birth. In the last review of a BBC Symphony Chorus concert before the lockdown, Paul Driver said in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;One was lost in admiration for the BBC Symphony Chorus, trained by Neil Ferris, in the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s account of the magnum opus at the Barbican, conducted by Donald Runnicles.&quot;

==Notable recordings==
As well as featuring in dedicated studio recordings for BBC Radio 3, the BBC Symphony Chorus&#x27;s discography consists of over 120 commercial recordings, many featuring collaborations with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Recent commercial recordings include Brett Dean’s &quot;Vexations and Devotions&quot; under David Robertson; Szymanowski’s &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, &quot;Harnasie&quot; and Symphony No. 3 under Edward Gardner; and Holst&#x27;s &quot;First Choral Symphony&quot;, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, Op. 38, and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (&quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;), all under the baton of its President, Sir Andrew Davis.

In 2004 and 2005, Warner Classics released five new CDs each year of music recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall at the previous year&#x27;s BBC Proms season, including the Last Night of the Proms. BBC Symphony Chorus contributions to these were as follows:

Chandos Records have released a series of recordings featuring the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in recent years, as follows:

The Sir Arthur Sullivan Society&#x27;s new complete recording of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Light of The World&quot; was made at Watford Colosseum on 21–25 April 2017 and released on St Cecilia&#x27;s day, 22 November 2018 (the anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death). The BBC Symphony Chorus and BBC Concert Orchestra were conducted by John Andrews, with the Kinder Children&#x27;s Choirs of the High Peak and soloists Natalya Romaniw, Eleanor Dennis, Kitty Whately, Robert Murray, Ben McAteer and Neal Davies.

Following a performance at the Barbican Centre on 13 October 2017, Martyn Brabbins recorded Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sea Symphony&quot; for Hyperion Records with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, Elizabeth Llewellyn and Marcus Farnsworth. This was released by Hyperion on 28 September 2018, coupled with &quot;Darest thou now, O soul&quot; (1925) for unison chorus and strings.

A number of BBC Symphony Chorus recordings have received awards, including the following:

<text>Caliber System Inc., known until 1996 as Roadway Services Inc., was a transportation holding company based in Akron, Ohio, United States. During its history, Caliber owned a number of logistics companies including Roadway Express, Viking Freight and Roadway Package System (RPS) among others. Roadway Express was spun off in 1995 and Caliber was acquired by FedEx in 1998 with subsidiaries becoming FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Global Logistics.

==History==

===Foundation and diversification===


Roadway Services Inc. (RSI) was created in 1982 as a holding company by national less than truckload (LTL) carrier Roadway Express. Roadway Express was initially RSI&#x27;s only subsidiary but in 1984 the company acquired short-haul carrier Spartan Express Inc., then specialized truckload carrier Nationwide Carriers Inc., and finally in 1984, it purchased Roberts Express, a same-day critical trucking company, from Emery Air Freight.

With both truckload and LTL services available via its subsidiaries, in 1985 RSI founded a package delivery service, Roadway Package System (RPS) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. RPS was intended to out-compete the package delivery services of UPS by structuring itself for lower costs. By 1988, RPS covered 70% of the US from 130 terminals.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s RSI experienced both expansion and contraction as it acquired the largest western US regional carrier, Viking Freight, but closed the unprofitable Nationwide Carriers in 1989. In 1990, Viking subsidiary VFS Transportation was closed and Spartan was absorbed into Viking, operating as a subsidiary. At the same time Roadway Express continued its expansion with services to Europe in 1991 and a number of Pacific Rim ports soon after. Also in 1991, RSI replaced Pan Am Corp. on the Dow Jones Transportation Average. At the time, RSI was the third-largest motor freight carrier in the US.

In 1993, RSI acquired Southwest regional LTL carrier Central Freight Lines which it placed in its Roadway Regional Group along with Viking in the West, Viking subsidiary Spartan in the central and southern US and Cole&#x27;s Express in New England. RSI also expanded into air freight with its 1993 founding of Roadway Global Air (RGA) based in Indianapolis.

===Roadway Express spinoff===

While RSI&#x27;s smaller regional carriers were all non-union, Roadway Express was unionized and in April 1994 it was impacted by a nationwide strike of the Teamsters Union. The strike was the result of a breakdown in negotiations between the Teamsters and Trucking Management Inc., a negotiating group which represented 23 large trucking companies including Roadway Express, Consolidated Freightways, and Yellow Freight. In the end, the strike lasted 24 days and, according to the RSI, resulted in losses of for the quarter at Roadway Express.

The strike at Roadway Express highlighted the division&#x27;s profitability imbalance when compared to RSI&#x27;s non-union carriers. At the time, Roadway Express contributed over 40% of the parent company&#x27;s annual revenue but was less profitable than the other trucking units. As a result, RSI announced in August 1995 that it would spin off Roadway Express as a separate, publicly traded company. As an independent company, Roadway Express grew substantially achieving profits of in its first year. In 2003 Roadway was acquired by Yellow Freight to form Yellow Roadway Corporation.

===Caliber System===

In November 1995, Roadway Services announced it was changing its name to Caliber System, effective in January 1996 and would move its stock listing from the Nasdaq to the NYSE under the new symbol &quot;CBB.&quot; It also rebranded Roadway Logistics and Roadway Technology to Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology, respectively.

Caliber immediately began an effort to reorganize in an attempt to decrease costs. In November it shut down RGA and sold the assets to Burlington Air Express. Caliber said it had lost on the venture. In December it announced it would be consolidating its remaining trucking companies, Viking (with subsidiary Spartan), Central, and Cole&#x27;s into a nationwide carrier named Viking Freight Inc. But, Caliber continued to experience significant losses.

Viking announced a wage freeze in July 1996 and in December said it would be eliminating 30 terminals and 1,500 jobs in a bid to reduce costs. Despite positive performances from RPS, Roberts, and Caliber Logistics in Q1 1997, Caliber announced in March it would be selling or closing a large portion of the eastern operations of Viking leaving it as a west coast-focused carrier.

Caliber reported Viking had seen losses of around after having been unable to bring Viking to profitability since merging its smaller, regional carriers into a nationwide offering. The cuts were expected to include 4,000 jobs and 83 terminals in the eastern, southern, and central US. These areas had been primarily served by the former Coles and Spartan subsidiaries. In June 1997, Caliber sold the assets that had formerly comprised Central to an investment group led by former Central leadership backed by trucking magnate and Swift Transportation co-founder Jerry Moyes. It was re-incorporated as Central Freight Lines and continued as an independent regional LTL carrier.

===Acquisition by FedEx===

In January 1998, Caliber System was acquired by the newly formed FDX Corp., now FedEx Corp, a company formed by Federal Express to serve as a holding company for its express business and its new, Caliber subsidiaries. Following the acquisition, former Caliber subsidiary Roadway Express () took Caliber&#x27;s place on the Dow Jones Transportation Average.

==Fate of subsidiaries==

In the years prior to its acquisition by FedEx, Caliber had already spun off, sold, or shut down several major subsidiaries:

* Nationwide Carriers, its truckload subsidiary, shut down in 1988 and its operations were absorbed by Viking

* Roadway Express was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company in 1995. It was acquired by rival Yellow Corp. in 2003 to form Yellow Roadway Corporation.

* Roadway Global Air was shut down in 1995 and its assets were sold to Burlington Air Express.

* Spartan Express had been made a subsidiary of Viking in 1990 and was merged into Viking in 1996. Its former operations were shut down in 1997 when Viking pulled out of the southeast.

*Coles Express had been merged into Viking in 1996 and its former operations were shut down in 1997 when Viking pulled out of the northeast.

* Central Freight Lines former assets (Viking&#x27;s central operations) were sold to former Central management in 1997 and resumed independent operations.

At the time of its acquisition by FedEx, Caliber had five major subsidiaries remaining:

* RPS became FedEx Ground in January 2000 complementing FedEx&#x27;s existing Federal Express courier business.

* Viking continued until 2002 when it was renamed FedEx Freight West, part of the new FedEx Freight brand along with American Freightways, renamed FedEx Freight East. With the 2006 acquisition of Watkins Motor Lines, all three were integrated into a single entity, FedEx Freight.

* Roberts remained focused on same-day-critical trucking services and was renamed FedEx Custom Critical in January 2000.

* Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology were merged to form FedEx Global Logistics shortly after the acquisition.

<text>In aviation, equivalent airspeed (EAS) is calibrated airspeed (CAS) corrected for the compressibility of air at a non-trivial Mach number. It is also the airspeed at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere at which the dynamic pressure is the same as the dynamic pressure at the true airspeed (TAS) and altitude at which the aircraft is flying. In low-speed flight, it is the speed which would be shown by an airspeed indicator with zero error. It is useful for predicting aircraft handling, aerodynamic loads, stalling etc.

EAS can also be obtained from the aircraft Mach number and static pressure.

where is impact pressure.

At standard sea level, EAS is the same as calibrated airspeed (CAS) and true airspeed (TAS). At any other altitude, EAS may be obtained from CAS by correcting for compressibility error.

The following simplified formula allows calculation of CAS from EAS:

<text>Alvin Robert Cornelius, H.Pk (8 May 1903 – 21 December 1991) was a Pakistani jurist, legal philosopher and judge, serving as the 4th Chief Justice of Pakistan from 1960 until 1968. In addition, he served as Law Minister in the cabinet of Yahya Khan, 1969 – 16 December 1971.

Cornelius was born in Agra, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh in British India, to an Urdu-speaking Anglo-Indian Roman Catholic family. He did his schooling at St. Peter&#x27;s College, Agra. Cornelius graduated from the University of Allahabad and Selwyn College, Cambridge. He was commissioned into the Indian Civil Service and was the assistant commissioner in the Punjab, starting his judicial career in the Lahore High Court in 1943, later joining the Justice department of the Punjab government. During this time, Cornelius became a recognised jurist, publishing important textbooks in Pakistani legal history during his career. Cornelius also became a leading activist for the Pakistan Movement.

In 1946, Cornelius was elevated to associate judge of the Lahore High Court; opting for Pakistan, Cornelius became an important figure in country&#x27;s legal history. Initially serving as the law secretary for Law Minister Jogendra Nath Mandal and Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, Cornelius played an integral role in setting up the court system while advising the law minister and the prime minister. Among his notable cases were actions defending non-Muslims&#x27; rights (Freedom of religion), the Bogra case against presidential reserve powers (see the inactive Article 58(2)B of the VIII Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan), defending workplace and labour laws, and sports law in regard to the Pakistan Cricket Board. Cornelius was regarded as a man of justice, fighting against religious extremism and religious discrimination, warning, in these regards, against &quot;A general feeling of despair, a widespread lack of confidence... and a common readiness to anticipate the worst&quot;.

In 1960, President Ayub Khan nominated Cornelius to the Chief Justiceship of Pakistan; rivals for the position were briefly discussed, but eventually he was elevated to the position. Alvin Robert Cornelius became the first Christian Chief Justice, becoming one of the most famous and influential figures ever to serve on the Supreme Court. After his departure from the Court, Cornelius remained influential and was a symbol of the protection of the rights of minorities and freedom of religious practices, whilst serving as the legal adviser to successive governments on judicial matters.

== Early life ==
=== Family roots and education ===

Alvin Robert Cornelius was born on 8 May 1903, in Agra, United Provinces of the British Indian Empire, to a Christian Anglo-Indian Urdu-speaking family. He came from a well established family of Anglo-Indian ancestry with Luso-Indian roots on his maternal side, and his parents Professor I.J. Cornelius and Tara D&#x27; Rozario were amongst a few of the notable figures of the Roman Catholic Anglo-Indian minority community of India. His maternal grandfather, Michael D&#x27;Rozario was Deputy-Range Officer-Forests, Central India. His father was a professor of mathematics at Holkar college. He was a close friend of lawyer Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar. Cornelius was admitted at the University of Allahabad after passing the university entrance exam in 1920. After admitting at the law school of the University of Allahabad, Cornelius gained his BS in mathematics and LLB in civil law, with writing a comprehensive thesis on history of religious law in 1924.

Cornelius joined the law faculty of the university, working there as a research associate, and won the government scholarship to pursue further education abroad. The same year, Cornelius went to the United Kingdom for his higher education and was admitted at Cambridge University, attending the Selwyn College to study law. In 1926, Cornelius graduated with LLM in Law and Justice and submitted his fundamental thesis on Western law. After reluctantly returning to India, Cornelius took the entrance exam and was commissioned as an officer at the Indian Civil Service, joining the Department of Law of the Government of Punjab.

== Career in law ==

He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1926. He served in Punjab, where he held the positions of Assistant Commissioner and District and Sessions Judge till 1943 when he joined Law Department of Government of Punjab as Legal Remembrancer. In 1946 Mr. Cornelius was elevated to the Bench of Lahore High Court.

=== Pakistan Movement ===

Cornelius was one of the notable Christian figures in the Pakistan Movement, closely collaborating with Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Cornelius was an active activist for the Pakistan Movement and one of the outspoken speakers of the movement, working to rally support for the Pakistan Movement. Unlike the opposition to the division of India, led by renowned Muslim leader Abul Kalam Azad, Cornelius felt that the creation of the Muslim homeland in India was one key solution to the ill-treatment of Muslims by the British government and among the leaders of the Congress Party of India, while at same time he revived the nationalism spirit. Cornelius assisted Jinnah drafting the Pakistan Resolution, adding the legal clauses and articles justifying the rights of Muslims majority, non-Muslim communities and the ill-treatment of under-class both Non-Muslims and Muslims by the Congress Party in 1941. His activism grew strong and deeper after accepting a legal position in the Punjab government, where he would go on to establish the court system of the newly created country. Cornelius was one of the earliest citizens of newly created country, Pakistan, opting the country&#x27;s citizenship as well as taking a federal law government assignment in the government of Liaquat Ali Khan.

=== Supreme Court of Pakistan ===
From 1950 to 1951, Cornelius served as secretary of Law and Labour at the Ministry of Law, Labour headed by Jogendra Nath Mandal. In 1951, following the assassination Prime minister Liaqat Ali Khan, Cornelius left the government assignment and was appointed as an associate judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in November 1951 and continued as a judge with regular intervals until 1953 when he was confirmed as a senior judge of the Federal Court of Pakistan.

==== Bogra vs. Governor-General ====
In 1954, the National Assembly of Pakistan tried to change the constitution to establish checks on the Governor-General&#x27;s powers, to prevent a repeat of what had happened to Nazimuddin&#x27;s government. In response, Ghulam Muhammad dismissed the Assembly, an action that was challenged in the Supreme Court. Ghulam Muhammad emerged victorious when the Chief Justice Muhammad Munir upheld the dismissal in a split decision, despite the dissenting opinion written by the renowned Justice (later Chief Justice) A. R. Cornelius, and despite protests from the members of the Assembly.

=== Chief Justice of Pakistan ===
Justice A.R. Cornelius was appointed as the Chief Justice of Pakistan in 1960.

== Legal philosophy ==
Legal mode of thought in the first 20 years of Pakistani history was dominated by two opposite currents: pro-secular and pro-Islamic. A peaceful co-existence of these two currents is precisely what distinguishes the first 20 years (1947 to 1966) from the next twenty (1967–1987), when the two currents became increasingly divergent in Pakistan.

The pro-secular tendency was apparently inherited from the colonial past, and was widespread among the intelligentsia and the educated. For a number of reasons it has been epitomised by Justice Muhammad Munir (1895–1979), who was the main author of the Munir Report (1954) about the anti-Ahmedi riots in Punjab. The report has long been hailed as a masterpiece of secular values.

Therefore, it is often seen as a matter of surprise that the same judge, after being promoted as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, upheld the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by Governor-General Malik Ghulam Muhammad soon thereafter. Yet, it might help to remember that Munir&#x27;s argument in favour of dictatorship – his famous &#x27;Doctrine of Necessity&#x27; that provided excuse to all subsequent dictators – was also rooted in his western learning just like his secularism (he supported his argument on a maxim of the 13th century British jurist Henry de Bracton).

That it was left to a Christian to present the case of Islam at the highest ladder of jurisprudence in the formative phase of the Pakistan would be regarded by some as a paradox, and by others as corroboration of Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s dream. Alvin Robert Cornelius was a relentless defender of Sharia, and arguably played the most important role in inculcating some Islamic values in the legal institutions of Pakistan.

The cornerstones of his legal philosophy may be summarised in three points: (a) Law has a moral function in society; (b) Law should be culture-sensitive; and (c) Islam is a valid foundation for a universal society. How he built upon these simple ideas in his 57 speeches and papers, and how he demonstrated them through his judgments, is what makes him arguably one of the greatest legal philosophers.

In 1954, when the bench headed by Chief Justice Munir upheld the decision of the Governor-General to dissolve the constituent assembly, Cornelius was the only judge to write a note of dissent. Four years later, when the same court upheld the case of Dosso against the martial law authorities, Cornelius wrote a concurrent judgment (i.e. he agreed with the decision but felt the need to explain himself separately). He observed that fundamental rights are inalienable, and cannot be suspended even by martial law. This point of view was so different from the rest that it was later seen as a &quot;note of dissent&quot;.

However, Cornelius&#x27; concept of inalienable rights seems to be slightly different from how the issue is usually projected. He was of the opinion that the people deserved to feel secure that law shall safeguard their cherished values and norms. In &#x27;Crime and Punishment of Crime&#x27;, the paper which he read at an international conference in Sydney in August 1965, he mentioned several cases to indicate &quot;the extent to which the law supports the indigenous disciplines operating in our society, through the authority of the elders.&quot; For similar reasons, he defended the indigenous institution of jirga as well as the punishments prescribed by Sharia for crimes like theft and robbery.

Acutely aware of the tendency to treat each individual as an island, Cornelius offered a few words of caution to his international audience, and his words reflected the ethos of his new nation that had come into being with the specific goal of rediscovering society as an organic unity. &quot;It must be recognised that crime is a biological fact of society, whether ancient or modern,&quot; he said. &quot;It grows out of social condition and is not to be contained without the most careful examination of its etiology… In that process, it would be well not to reject, out of hand as being out-dated, the principles and techniques laid down and applied by the ancients, for dealing with the problem in their times. They may have their uses, and certainly in eastern countries, they still possess validity.&quot;

== Cricket ==
Cornelius was closely associated with the Lahore Gymkhana Cricket Club which played at Bagh-e-Jinnah. He was the main founding figure of Pakistan cricket after partition.
Cornelius one of the three original vice-presidents of the Pakistan Cricket Board (then B.C.C.P.) and became chairman of the working committee, serving until he first relinquished his connection with the Board in early 1953.
Cornelius was in September 1960 made chairman of the first Ad Hoc Committee, created to run cricket in Pakistan until May 1963.
Cornelius&#x27;s proudest achievement in cricket was to found the Pakistan Eaglets, an informal club of promising young Pakistani cricketers, which made tours of England in 1952 and 1953 in preparation for the first full Test tour of England in 1954.

== Death ==

Cornelius was residing permanently in Faletti&#x27;s Hotel Lahore after retirement. He died at the age of 88 on 21 December 1991 in Lahore and was buried in the city&#x27;s Christian cemetery.

<text>Kennacraig () is a hamlet situated on West Loch Tarbert, a southwest of Tarbert on the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll and Bute, in the west of Scotland.

==Ferry terminal==
Caledonian MacBrayne ferries sail from the terminal, on the rocky islet Eilean Ceann na Creige, to Port Ellen or Port Askaig on Islay, and also to Colonsay during the summer season.

Western Ferries started a car ferry to Islay from 7 April 1968 and CalMac took over in 1978, having previously used West Loch Tarbert.

<doc id="1129362" wikidata="Q3476350" url="?curid=1129362" title="Scottish Citylink">
<text>Scottish Citylink is a long-distance express coach operator in Scotland and Ireland (where it operates as Irish Citylink) and formerly England (where it operated as Stansted Citylink). The company was formed as a subsidiary of Scottish Transport Group in March 1985. It is operated as a 63/37 joint venture between ComfortDelGro and Stagecoach.

==Operation==
Scottish Citylink operates an extensive network of long-distance express services within Scotland, operating 19 routes linking the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling and Inverness, as well as linking some rural Highland communities to the main urban areas of Scotland. Services also operate to Northern Ireland, with a connection via the ferry link between Cairnryan and Belfast, and there are seasonal workings to Blackpool. In all, over 200 destinations are served by Scottish Citylink within Scotland, using about 90 coaches provided by operators local to the &#x27;destination&#x27; area, carrying over three million passengers annually.

Despite the extent of Citylink&#x27;s operations in Scotland, there are notable geographical regions, including large urban areas, that have poor or no connections with the network. These tend to be areas served by subsidiaries of Stagecoach, which operate their own comprehensive network, to destinations such as Ayrshire (Kilmarnock, Ayr and Irvine), Fife (Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline and St Andrews), Aberdeenshire and Moray. A notable exception is the Scottish Borders, which is covered by West Coast Motors, though they have no regular express service.

Citylink also operates in the Republic of Ireland, operating between Dublin, Galway City, Clifden, Cork and Shannon.

==History==

Scottish Citylink Coaches was formed in 1985 during the reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group to co-ordinate and manage the long-distance express services operated by the other SBG subsidiaries, particularly the Western Scottish and Eastern Scottish services from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London and the south.

By combining the SBG express network, Citylink became the largest operator of long-distance express services within Scotland, and from Scotland to England and Wales. With the main hubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh, many services to the Highlands and Islands were in some cases vital to rural areas as the only public transport link available.

One vehicle was owned to satisfy licensing conditions, but this was operated as part of the Western Scottish fleet. Citylink itself did not operate any vehicles, but a uniform two-tone blue and yellow livery was introduced for coaches operating Citylink services, with the subsidiary&#x27;s corporate fleetname displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle. Previously, only cross-border services had adopted some form of corporate look in the late 1970s, with vehicles wearing a simple but striking blue-and-white livery with bold &quot;Scottish&quot; fleetnames in the SBG corporate logo style.

Subsidiary companies operated Citylink vehicles on express services originating from their operating area, and where long-distance services spanned one or two operating areas, the routes were shared between the companies. The level of involvement of the subsidiary firms in providing Citylink work varied with size and geography. Central Scottish, Strathtay Scottish, Kelvin Scottish and Clydeside Scottish were the smaller contributors as no major city or destination lay within their main operating regions. Indeed, Clydeside marketed its own express services within its area as &quot;Clydeside Quicksilver&quot; with its own distinct brand.

As the Scottish Bus Group prepared for privatisation, Citylink franchises were no longer exclusive to the SBG subsidiaries. Private companies such as Rapsons Coaches of Inverness, Henry Crawford Coaches of Neilston, West Coast Motors of Campbeltown, Skye-Ways and Park&#x27;s of Hamilton were awarded Citylink contracts and provided vehicles of their own for this work. Also seen using a Citylink livery but with the distinctive &quot;Ulsterman&quot; lettering, Ulsterbus provided coaches for services between Derry or Belfast to Birmingham and London via towns in Dumfries and Galloway. This route was also operated by Dodds of Troon and Western Scottish.

Citylink itself was privatised in August 1990, operating under the Clansman Travel &amp; Leisure holding company after being purchased by its management and employees in a management buyout. As the Scottish Bus Group broke up, the number of private operators working Citylink contracts increased. Park&#x27;s, West Coast Motors and Rapsons were now major contributors, while the former SBG companies now owned by Stagecoach (Fife Scottish, Western Scottish, Bluebird Buses) began operating their own Stagecoach Express network.
In 1993 Scottish Citylink was sold to National Express. At that time, cross border services to England were replaced by National Express services, leaving Citylink with Scottish domestic services, and co-ordinated timetabling and ticketing was introduced between the two operators. During this period, Citylink took a stake in West Coast Motors, purchased Skye-Ways Coaches and also Highland Country Buses, which was an offshoot of Highland Scottish.

With the privatisation of British Rail, in 1997 National Express won the ScotRail franchise. The Mergers &amp; Monopolies Commission ruled this would give National Express a monopoly on long-distance services in Scotland and ordered the sale of Scottish Citylink. Scottish Citylink was subsequently sold to Metroline, the London-based subsidiary of ComfortDelGro, for £10.3 million in August 1998.

In 2002, the company began trading in the Republic of Ireland, acquiring Cummer Commercials, which operated on the Dublin to Galway route (and also traded as CityLink Express). The route has since been rebranded to the yellow-blue Citylink livery (although without the &quot;Scottish&quot; prefix) and has expanded to provide services from Galway to Shannon.

Ownership of Scottish Citylink was transferred from Metroline plc to Bradell plc, another subsidiary of ComfortDelGro, on 31 December 2004. Following Stagecoach&#x27;s launch of Megabus and acquisition of the Motorvator brand in 2003 and 2004 respectively, Stagecoach and CostaDelGro agreed for Scottish Citylink to become a joint venture on 12 September 2005. In return for 35% of the company, Stagecoach transferred rights to operate select Megabus and Motorvator routes in Scotland to Scottish Citylink and sub-contracted as an operator, while ComfortDelGro maintained a majority 65% stake.

Following Stagecoach&#x27;s takeover by a DWS-managed investment fund, it agreed to sell its Megabus retail platform and customer service business as well as the Falcon South-West brand running between Plymouth and Bristol Airport to Scottish Citylink. In return, its shareholding increased to 37.5%, with ComfortDelGro decreasing theirs to 62.5%. As part of an original plan to merge with rival intercity coach operator National Express, Stagecoach had agreed to sell its shareholding to ComfortDelGro to satisfy Competition &amp; Markets Authority demands, however this deal fell through.

==Present==

The company&#x27;s current head office is at Buchanan bus station in Glasgow, where many of its services start and terminate. Citylink itself does not operate or own buses in its own right, although one owned and operated by Stagecoach West Scotland carries CityLink accreditation to satisfy licensing conditions. The two-tone blue and yellow colour scheme is still used, though its application and style have changed over the years.

From 2004, the operating companies faced heavy competition from Megabus and Motorvator, both subsidiaries of Stagecoach. In September 2005 ComfortDelGro and Stagecoach agreed to a joint venture to provide express coach services in Scotland, ending the competition between the two operators. Under the terms of the agreement, Stagecoach gained a 35% shareholding in Scottish Citylink and in return granted certain rights to the Megabus and Motorvator brands in Scotland.

Despite being a minority shareholder, Stagecoach appeared to have assumed operational control. Stagecoach staff replaced much of the former Citylink management, while Stagecoach&#x27;s Scottish subsidiaries began operating many of the routes formerly operated by subcontractors displaced from Citylink work. Citylink service numbers, timetables and routes were also sacrificed in favour of Megabus where the two brands overlapped.

In March 2006 the Competition Commission launched an investigation and ruled that the joint venture substantially reduced competition and that evidence suggested it led to higher fares on some routes. Stagecoach immediately criticised the ruling, stating that a period of further consultation would cause uncertainty among passengers and leave vital services in limbo, while jeopardising Scotland&#x27;s intercity coach network and its ability to compete with both train and car Criticism of the Competition Commission&#x27;s draft findings grew in Scotland and the joint venture received support from across the political spectrum in the Scottish Parliament In early 2008, certain routes, which were at the time already contacted out to Park&#x27;s, were divested to comply with the ruling.

Today many of the services are operated by Stagecoach subsidiaries Stagecoach East Scotland, Stagecoach Highlands and Stagecoach West Scotland. Some services are operated by Edinburgh Coach Lines, Shiel Buses and West Coast Motors.

In May 2023, West Coast Motors became the first operator on the Citylink network to operate mirrorless coaches. The company introduced six brand new DAF-powered Irizar i6s tri-axle coaches on routes to Fort William, Skye, and Campbeltown.

In February 2024, Scottish Citylink launched its own app with built in coach tracker, both on Android Play store and also on the Apple app store, free to download.

In December 2024,Scottish Citylink invested in new Transmach ticket machines. This allowed the use of QR codes for the first time and eliminated the requirement for paper passenger manifests.

== Routes and Operators ==
As of April 2024, Scottish Citylink operates the following routes.

A variety of companies operate services on behalf of Scottish Citylink. The main operators are;

* Stagecoach 
* Parks of Hamilton
* West Coast Motors
* Shiel Buses
* Edinburgh Coach Lines
* Ulsterbus

Some smaller private operators also operate duplicate and additional journeys, as well as standby rolls at major interchanges. These include Ratho Coaches, Simpsons of Rosehearty, Fishers Tours, Hairy Haggis Coaches of Bathgate, McLean&#x27;s of Airdrie and D&amp;E Coaches.

==Citylink Gold==

In 2010, Citylink launched the &quot;Gold&quot; brand for services between Glasgow and Aberdeen or Inverness. The Citylink Gold brand is similar to the Stagecoach Gold brand used by Stagecoach bus subsidiaries, and offers a more luxurious service with leather seats, free wi-fi and extra services aboard. The service is also intended to provide quicker journeys than the regular bus routes which may service significant numbers of smaller towns and settlements along their routes, though may stop at those towns or settlements deemed to be important to serve. With Citylink Gold, passengers are offered free tea, coffee, cold drinks and snacks on the coach. As of May 2019, Five return services per day in each direction on routes from Glasgow to Aberdeen and four return services from Glasgow to Inverness, additionally, three Edinburgh to Inverness return services and also four Edinburgh to Aberdeen return services, all now designated as Citylink Gold. Fares have remained the same with Super Singles available on the routes as they were whilst under standard Citylink branding. The Citylink Gold services are as follows:
*G9 Glasgow – Aberdeen
*G10 Glasgow – Aviemore – Inverness
*G90 Edinburgh – Perth – Pitlochry – Aviemore – Inverness
*G92 Edinburgh – Halbeath – Dundee – Aberdeen

The Gold service was withdrawn in March 2020 and replaced with the &quot;6 Cities&quot; brand in collaboration with Megabus.

==Stansted Citylink==
On 11 December 2015, a St Pancras railway station to Stansted Airport service commenced under the Stansted Citylink banner. The service ceased operations nearly two years later on 28 October 2017.

<doc id="1129363" wikidata="Q6967084" url="?curid=1129363" title="Nasim Hasan Shah">
<text>Nasim Hasan Shah (Urdu: ) (15 April 1929 – 3 February 2015) was a Pakistani jurist and served as Chief Justice of Pakistan. He is best known for his role in the verdict against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, which resulted in the death penalty.

His other notable verdict was restoration of the parliament of Pakistan dissolved by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The Supreme Court held that dissolution order was based on an incorrect appreciation of the role assigned to the president and of the powers vested in him by the constitution. The Prime Minister is not answerable to the President. In fact, it is the president who is obliged to act on the advice of the Prime Minister except when he enjoys discretionary powers.
An inspiring man physically 56 inches tall and 50 inches in girth, he overcame his handicap to become the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan from 17 April 1993 to 14 April 1994. After a brilliant academic career and a Doctorate of Law (with distinction) from Paris University, he had a successful legal practice when he was appointed a High Court Judge at the age of 39, and retired from Supreme Court at 65, the longest tenure by any judge in the history of the Indian subcontinent.

==Bhutto case controversy==

Perhaps the only time in Pakistans&#x27; Judicial History that a petition against a Former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Pakistan was filed, seeking registration of a case against him on charges of abetting in the &quot;murder&quot; of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
A division bench comprising Justices Sheikh Abdur Rashid and Bilal Khan held that the petition hardly qualified for processing because the judge of a bench could not be proceeded against in a case which had already been decided.

The members of the bench felt that petitioner &quot;Mian Mohammad Hanif Tahir&quot; of the &quot;People&#x27;s Lawyers Forum&quot;(PLF) was hardly prepared to address legal aspects of the case and questions arising out of the petition. Instead, he was agitating legal points in a political manner.

One member of the bench remarked; 
:&quot;In a situation where the judgment of a case was effective for citation as a reference, an ambiguous statement of one of the members of a panel of judges hearing the case, could in no way prejudice the decision after two decades. If such things were allowed to happen, the whole judicial system would collapse&quot;.

(PLF) leader Hanif Tahir had quoted the former chief justice as saying in two of his press interviews that the Supreme Court judgment in the appeal of the late Bhutto against his death sentence awarded by the Lahore High Court, was a wrong decision and it was a fit case for lesser punishment.

The petitioner submitted that Mr Shah was part of the 7-member bench of the Supreme Court which upheld the death penalty. He contended that comments of the former chief justice amounted to a confessional statement and that he had shown no such sentiments while agreeing with the majority opinion of apex court&#x27;s bench which confirmed the execution of Mr Bhutto.

When the proceedings began, the petitioner requested the court that a larger bench be constituted to hear the case which was of paramount importance. Rejecting the request, the court informed Mr Tahir that petitions seeking registration of &quot;FIRs&quot; were usually heard by a single bench. It was because of the nature of case that the chief justice had constituted a division bench.

Later, the petitioner requested for time to collect evidence and sought an adjournment. The court refused to do so and directed him to argue his case as he should have gathered evidence before coming to the court.

The petitioner started with quotes from the interview of Mr Shah. The court asked him if such quotes, taken from a television interview, carried any legal significance. When the petitioner submitted that the text of interview was a &quot;public document&quot;, the court asked the lawyer to define the legality of public documents and remarked that points raised in the petition were based on hearsay.

As for petitioner&#x27;s contention that Mr Shah had made a confessional statement in his interview, the court directed him to examine the relevant law to know what a confessional statement was and if it carried a legal weight if given on a non-judicial or extrajudicial forum. He must also differentiate between a press statement and a legal statement recorded in a court of law.
The bench of the Lahore High Court on 12 February 2004 dismissed in limina.

On 25 February 2010, President Asif Ali Zardari said in Quetta: &quot;I believe former Justice Naseem Hassan Shah as the murderer of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.&quot;

=== Pakistan Cricket Board President===

Justice Nasim Hasan Shah has remained President of the Board between 1993 and 1994 and during his tenure an ad hoc committee was placed on the Karachi City Cricket Association (KCCA) whose affiliation with the Board had been suspended after the shock confession in a television interview by Dr Nasim Hasan Shah, a member of the Supreme Court bench which rejected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s appeal, that he had joined the rejectionists under pressure. The decision led to the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

<text>A trade show, also known as trade fair, trade exhibition, or trade exposition, is an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products and services, meet with industry partners and customers, study activities of competitors, and examine recent market trends and opportunities.

In contrast to consumer shows, only some trade shows are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either &quot;public&quot; or &quot;trade only&quot;. A few shows are hybrids of the two; one example is the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is trade only for its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days. They are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract companies from around the globe. For example, in the U.S., there are currently over 10,000 trade shows held every year, and several online directories have been established to help organizers, attendees, and marketers identify appropriate events.

==History==
Modern trade shows follow in the tradition of trade fairs established in late medieval Europe such as the Champagne fairs or the Skåne Market, in the era of merchant capitalism. In this era, produce and craft producers visited towns for trading fairs, to sell and showcase products. These markets were held annually or on several specific days a year, usually at geographically particularly favorable locations and in conjunction with a religious festival in order to benefit from the rush of the public. The tradition of fairs taking place in spring and autumn has been preserved in some cases until today. From the late eighteenth century, industrial exhibitions in Europe and North America became more common reflecting the technological dynamism of the Industrial Revolution.

In the late 19th century, the concept of annual industry-wide trade shows gained traction, spreading from European manufacturing centers to North America. By the 20th century, specialized companies came into existence simply to manage the trade-show industry, and permanent trade show grounds or convention centres were established as venues that featured a rotating calendar of trade shows.

In the 21st century, with the rapid industrialization of Asia, trade shows and exhibitions are now commonplace throughout the Asian continent, with China dominating the exhibitions industry in Asia, accounting for more than 55 per cent of all space sold in the region in 2011.

==Use==
Trade shows play important roles in marketing as well as business networking in market sectors that use them. People will seek to meet people and companies at their own level in the supply chain, as well as potential suppliers and potential buyers.

Generally there will be a central trade show floor with booths where people exhibit their goods or services, and throughout the day there will be seminars for continuing education on matters relevant to the industry, like best practices, trends, and regulation. There will also be some shared meals with keynote speakers, and social events in the evenings. Booths range from simple tables to elaborate constructions.

Trade shows often involve a considerable investment in time and money by participating companies. The planning includes arranging meetings with other attendees beforehand and resources to follow up on opportunities that are created at the show. Costs include space rental, booth design and construction of trade show displays, telecommunications, travel, accommodations, and promotional literature and items to give to attendees.

In addition, costs are incurred at the show for services such as electrical, booth cleaning, internet services, and drayage (also known as material handling). This local spending on logistics leads cities to promote trade shows as a means of local economic development, as well as providing opportunities for local businesses to grow, and attract new businesses to come.

<doc id="1129379" wikidata="Q2513114" url="?curid=1129379" title="New York State Right to Life Party">
<text>The New York State Right to Life Party was a minor anti-abortion American political party that was active only in the state of New York and was founded to oppose the legalization of abortion in New York State in 1970.

==History==

In 1970 the Right to Life Party was formed in New York following the decriminalization of abortion in New York. The party attempted to run a gubernatorial ticket made up of Jane Gilroy and Marcia Pilsner and obtained 14,062 signatures, 2,000 more than the 12,000 needed to receive ballot access. However, Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo rejected the petition and the decision was upheld by the state supreme court.

The party first made the state ballot in the 1978 gubernatorial election, where its candidate Mary Jane Tobin won 130,000 votes. Its share of the vote subsequently declined, although it maintained official ballot status until 2002, when it fell short of the 50,000 votes required to remain on the ballot. In 2006, the party endorsed Reverend Jennifer Liese for Governor. Liese&#x27;s signatures were disputed by a Republican staffer, Rachel L. Bledi. As of November 2006 there were 40,278 members statewide. The party did not endorse a gubernatorial candidate in 2010, though it has been able to get two state supreme court nominees onto the ballot via the petition process.

In 1980 Ronald Reagan attempted to gain the extra ballot access line provided by the party, but was rejected after refusing to agree to the terms that he must choose an anti-abortion vice presidential candidate, endorse Al D&#x27;Amato against Jacob Javits in the Republican Senate primary, and to only endorse Republicans who supported an anti-abortion constitutional amendment. The party ran Ellen McCormack, who had run in the 1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries, in the 1980 presidential election and received 32,327 votes nationally and 24,159 in New York; Reagan won the state against Carter by 165,459 without the extra ballot line. In 1984 the party refused to run or endorse any candidate for president by a vote of 27,000 to 22,000. The leadership of the party criticized and stated that Reagan was not anti-abortion enough due to his stance on that issue as governor of California and for having George H. W. Bush as his running mate. In 1992 despite having refused to give Reagan its ballot line due to George H. W. Bush being his vice president, the chairwoman of the party stated that his vetoes of abortion rights bills made them willing to give him their nomination.

In 1996 the party gave its ballot line to Constitution Party candidate Howard Phillips which was the only time the party has appeared on the New York presidential ballot.

On August 18, 2000 the party voted to give Reform nominee Patrick Buchanan an additional ballot line for the presidential election, over George W. Bush who had given them no response and Howard Phillips, which was accepted on September 23.

Despite losing ballot access in 2002, the party endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012, and Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.

<doc id="1129390" wikidata="Q46217" url="?curid=1129390" title="Stanisław Poniatowski (1676–1762)">
<text>Stanisław Poniatowski (15 September 1676 – 29 August 1762) was a Polish military commander, diplomat, and noble. Throughout his career, Poniatowski served in various military offices, and was a general in both the Swedish and Polish–Lithuanian militaries. He also held numerous civil positions, including those of &quot;podstoli&quot; of Lithuania and Grand Treasurer of the Lithuanian army in 1722, voivode of the Masovian Voivodeship in 1731, regimentarz of the Crown Army in 1728, and castellan of Kraków in 1752. Throughout his lifetime, he served in many &quot;starost&quot; positions.

Poniatowski was involved in Commonwealth politics, and was a prominent member of the Familia, a faction led by the Czartoryski family. On a number of occasions he was in service of Stanisław I Leszczyński, the principal rival of Augustus II for the throne of Poland. Having served under Leszczyński as a military officer and envoy during the Great Northern War, Poniatowski later embraced the Russian-supported Augustus. Subsequently, during the War of the Polish Succession, he returned, with the majority of the Familia, to his earlier allegiance. He later effected a reconciliation with Augustus III, and eventually became one of the new king&#x27;s chief advisors.

Poniatowski&#x27;s fifth son, Stanisław August Poniatowski, reigned as the last king of Poland from 1764 until 1795, when he abdicated as a result of the Third Partition of Poland by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. His grandson, Prince Józef Antoni Poniatowski, was a Polish general and later a Marshal of the First French Empire, serving under Napoleon I.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Poniatowski was born on 15 September 1676 in the village of Chojnik, now part of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. He was the son of Franciszek Poniatowski (1651–1691), &quot;Master of the Hunt&quot; in 1680 and cup-bearer at Wyszogród in 1690, and his wife Helena Niewiarowska, (died 1673/74). He was also the paternal grandson of one Jan Poniatowski, who died before 1676, although rumors regarding his parentage claimed that he was the son of Hetman Jan Kazimierz Sapieha by an unknown Polish Jewish woman, later adopted by Franciszek.

He received elementary education in Kraków, at either the Kraków Academy or at the Nowodworski School. At 13, he was sent to Vienna, capital of the Holy Roman Empire where he spent two years, and afterward traveled to Serbia, then a province of that empire. There, he volunteered to join Imperial forces campaigning against the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War. He served as an adjutant to Michał Franciszek Sapieha, and later commanded a company of cuirassiers. He participated in the Battle of Zenta in 1697.

After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, which ended the war, he returned to Lithuania. Upon his return, he wed Teresa Woynianka-Jasieniecka, but their marriage ended abruptly with her death not long afterward. The union, however, raised his social status. In 1700, he participated in the Lithuanian Civil War as a supporter of the Sapieha family, fighting in the Battle of Valkininkai. Here, he was captured, but managed to escape, and he later served as Sapieha&#x27;s emissary to Charles XII, king of Sweden.

=== The Great Northern War and subsequent Swedish service ===
In 1702, Swedish forces invaded the Commonwealth as part of the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an ally of the Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus&#x27;s forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was replaced by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons. In 1705, he became the colonel over Leszczyński&#x27;s newly raised Trabant guard, modeled after the reputable Swedish Drabant Corps.

In 1708, Leszczyński appointed Poniatowski his personal representative to Charles XII. He participated in the Battle of Holowczyn that year, and served as an aide to Charles XII during his exile in the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Here, he worked to establish an alliance between the Ottomans and the Swedes, aiming to bring the Ottomans into the war against Russia. Due to diplomatic efforts on the part of the French, aligned with Sweden, the Ottomans began to campaign against the Russians in 1710. With this change in Ottoman foreign policy came the dismissal of Çorlulu Ali Pasha, Grand Vizier of Ahmed III. His successor, Köprülü Numan Pasha, was an acquaintance of Poniatowski and had been a supporter of an anti-Russian shift in Ottoman politics.

Poniatowski accompanied the Ottomans during the Pruth River Campaign, but was dissatisfied with the Treaty of the Pruth, which saw the withdrawal of the Ottomans from the war. His attempts to prolong and inflame the conflict failed, resulting in a loss of his status in the Empire and his eventual departure from it in 1713.

Poniatowski did not return to Poland, as Lesczyński had been forced to retreat to Swedish Pomerania upon the return of Augustus in 1709. With the support of Russian forces, Augustus had forced Lesczyński from the throne and had retaken the crown in that year. Instead, Poniatowski entered the service of Sweden, serving as a diplomat for both Charles XII and Lesczyński. He was later involved in mediation attempts between Lesczyński and Augustus, and also joined the Swedish army in various campaigns, being wounded during one in 1716. During the course of his diplomatic activities, he traveled throughout Europe, including to such countries as Prussia, France, and Spain. For his service to Charles XII, he received the position of the governor of Palatine Zweibrücken, then in personal union with Sweden.

===Later years: Polish politician and magnate===

Upon Charles&#x27;s death in 1718, he continued to serve Leszczyński as a diplomat. In 1719 he was briefly imprisoned in Copenhagen, and requested official leave from the Swedish government, which he received that year, thus ending his service as a Swedish diplomat. He returned to the Commonwealth, where he used the title of a general of cavalry. On 14 September 1720 he married Princess Konstancja Czartoryska; this marriage brought him significant wealth. Over the next few years, he became increasingly involved in the creation of the Familia political faction, and most of his ensuing actions had the goal of increasing the Familia&#x27;s political power.

On 5 December 1722 he received the office of Podstoli of Lithuania (&quot;podstoli litewski&quot;) in 1722, and 16 December, Grand Treasurer of Lithuanian Army (&quot;podskarbi wielki litewski&quot;), and became increasingly allied with August II On 20 December 1724 he received the military rank of General of the Lithuanian Army (&quot;generał lejtnant wojsk litewskich&quot;). In 1726 he became the Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. He was also promised the position of Grand Crown Hetman by August II, receiving in 1728 the rank of a Crown regimentarz. During a period in which no Crown hetmans were appointed, he acted as &quot;de facto&quot; commander of the Polish–Lithuanian army. He enjoyed support from the military, but his forays into politics gained him significant opposition among the szlachta, led by the Potocki family. He became the voivode of the Masovian Voivodeship in 1731.

After August II&#x27;s death in 1733, he rekindled his old ties with Leszczyński, but made some attempts to secure his own election to the throne. Eventually, however, he decided to grant Leszczyński his full support, doing so during the convocation sejm of 1733. He again served as Leszczyński&#x27;s diplomat during the following War of the Polish Succession.

In 1734, he switched sides and joined the supported Augustus III. After several years of distrust, August III started treating Poniatowski as one of his major advisers. Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans for reform and strengthening the Commonwealth, however most of them have failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings. Those failures likely resulted in his apathy, and he became much less active on the political scene in the 1750s. On 6 June 1752 he received the office of castellan of Kraków.

Near the end of his life, Poniatowski was among the richest magnates in the Commonwealth, with the value of his estates estimated at about 4 million zlotys. He died in Ryki on 29 August 1762, shortly after suffering a serious fall while walking.

<doc id="1129396" wikidata="Q1751431" url="?curid=1129396" title="The Corsair">
<text>The Corsair (1814) is a long tale in verse written by Lord Byron (see 1814 in poetry) and published by John Murray in London. It was extremely popular, selling ten thousand copies on its first day of sale, and was influential throughout the following century, inspiring operas, music and ballet. The 180-page work was dedicated to Irish poet Thomas Moore.

==Background==
The poem, divided into cantos (like Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;), narrates the story of the corsair or privateer Conrad. It says that in his youth he was rejected by society because of his acts and his later war against humanity (excepting women). In this 180-page tale, the figure of the Byronic hero emerges, &quot;that man of loneliness and mystery&quot; who perceives himself a &quot;villain&quot;, an anti-hero.

Many Americans believed the poem was based on the life of the privateer/pirate Jean Lafitte.

==Summary==
The plot focuses on Conrad, a corsair, a kind of pirate or privateer. The first canto recounts Conrad&#x27;s plan to attack the Pacha Seyd and seize his possessions. Conrad&#x27;s wife, Medora, however, is determined to convince him to abandon his plan and not to embark on the mission. He sails from his island in the Aegean Sea to attack the pacha on another island.

The second canto describes the attack. Disguised, Conrad and his brigands begin their assault against Pacha Seyd, which goes according to plan. But then Conrad hears the cries of the women in the pacha&#x27;s harem, so he tries to free them. This change from the original plan enables the pacha&#x27;s forces to mount a successful counterattack. They kill most of the attackers and imprison Conrad. Gulnare, the pacha&#x27;s slave, secretly goes to Conrad&#x27;s cell, where she tells him that, in gratitude for his attempt to save her and the other women, she will try to save him.

In the third and final canto, Gulnare initiates the escape plan by trying to trick Seyd into freeing Conrad. When this fails, the pacha threatens to kill both her and Conrad. Gulnare tries to convince Conrad to kill Seyd and arranges for a knife to be taken to his cell, but Conrad refuses to kill him in cold blood without a fair fight. 

Gulnare therefore kills the pacha herself. She and Conrad escape, successfully reaching his island. Conrad learns that his wife, Medora, believing Conrad had died in Seyd&#x27;s counterattack, has died of grief. In the final scene, Conrad departs from the island alone, without Gulnare: &quot;He left a Corsair&#x27;s name to other times,/ Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.&quot;

==Influence==

&quot;The Corsair&quot; was adapted for or inspired numerous other works in a variety of genres, although Byron did not live long enough to know about most of them.

In music, the poem was the basis for the grand opera &quot;The Pacha&#x27;s Bridal&quot; (1836), with music by Francis Romer and a libretto by Mark Lemon; the opera &quot;Il corsaro&quot; (1848) by Giuseppe Verdi; and the ballet &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; (1856) by Adolphe Adam. The poem inspired the overture &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; (1845) by Hector Berlioz, and in 1908 Edward Elgar composed the song &quot;Deep in My Soul&quot; in 1908 with lines from &quot;The Corsair&quot;.

Horace Vernet produced an 1824 painting &quot;Conrad the Corsair&quot;, now in the Wallace Collection. French painter Eugène Delacroix depicted a scene from the work in a watercolor, &quot;Episode from The Corsair&quot; (1831), which shows Gulnare visiting the imprisoned Conrad in his cell. In 1815, Henry Fuseli sketched &quot;Conrad Rescues Gulnare&quot;. Henry Singleton and Richard Corbould also produced paintings based on the work.

In 1840, American editor and author N. P. Willis named his new periodical &quot;The Corsair&quot; after Byron&#x27;s poem.

<text>The Criterion Collection, Inc. (or simply Criterion) is an American home-video distribution company that focuses on licensing, restoring and distributing &quot;important classic and contemporary films&quot;. A &quot;de facto&quot; subsidiary of arthouse film distributor Janus Films, Criterion serves film and media scholars, cinephiles and public and academic libraries. Criterion has helped to standardize certain aspects of home-video releases such as film restoration, the letterboxing format for widescreen films and the inclusion of bonus features such as scholarly essays and documentary content about the films and filmmakers. Criterion most notably pioneered the use of commentary tracks. Criterion has produced and distributed more than 1,200 special editions of its films in VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray formats and box sets. These films and their special features are also available via The Criterion Channel, an online streaming service that the company operates.

The Criterion Collection is considered the leading boutique Blu-ray label.

In the United States, their releases are currently distributed by Studio Distribution Services, a joint venture between Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, via a distribution deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who released the company&#x27;s content on home video from 2013 to 2024. In the United Kingdom, Spirit Entertainment handles distribution of Criterion titles since October 2023. In Canada, their releases are currently distributed by Unobstructed View since 2019, after their deal with Entertainment One expired that year.

==History==
The company was founded in 1984 by Robert Stein, Aleen Stein and Joe Medjuck, who later were joined by Roger Smith. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker and Jonathan B. Turell founded the Voyager Company to publish educational multimedia CD-ROMs (1989–2000), and the Criterion Collection became a subordinate division of the Voyager Company, with Janus Films holding a minority stake in the company, and decided to expand its product on videocassettes and videodiscs. In March 1994, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH bought 20% of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the four founders each retained a 20% owner&#x27;s share.

In 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and Holtzbrinck Publishers sold the Voyager brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site and associated assets to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI). Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager/Criterion company share. The remaining three partners, Aleen Stein, Becker and Turell owned the Criterion Collection company, which has a business partnership with Janus Films and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment would handle distribution. In May 2024, Janus Films and Criterion were acquired by Steven Rales.

On June 24, 2024, it was reported that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment had entered into a distribution deal with SDS to handle the physical distribution of titles from Sony Pictures (Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Crunchyroll, LLC, etc.) as well as Criterion, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd., 20th Century Studios, etc.) and Lionsgate Home Entertainment (Lionsgate Films, Summit Entertainment, eOne Films, Roadside Attractions, etc.) through their existing distribution deals with SPHE.

===Home Vision Entertainment===
In 1986, Charles Benton founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including The Merchant Ivory Collection and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, Image Entertainment bought HVE making it the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013.

===Online ventures and marketing===
The Criterion Collection began to provide video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with Mubi (formerly &quot;The Auteurs&quot;) in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to Hulu Plus. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection. Some Criterion films were streamed by Kanopy. On October 26, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would shut down on November 29. Criterion stated in a blog post that it was &quot;trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible&quot;.

On November 16, 2018, Criterion announced the launch of the Criterion Channel as a standalone service, wholly owned and operated by the Criterion Collection, in the United States and Canada. Some of the VOD service&#x27;s offerings are also available on the Max streaming platform.

British film magazine &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; revealed in its April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom. The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016.

==Contributions and influence==
The Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect-ratio letterboxing presentation of films, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become industry-wide standards for premium home video releases.

===Letterboxing===
With its eighth LaserDisc release, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956), Criterion introduced the letterbox format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the 4:3 standard television set in order to preserve the original aspect ratio of the film. Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios.

===Commentary soundtracks===
The Criterion Collection&#x27;s second LaserDisc title, &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific audio commentary contained in a separate analog channel of the LaserDisc, in which American film historian Ronald Haver spoke about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects. He also provides commentary on the LaserDisc editions of &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collectors&#x27; items when the original studios reissued titles previously licensed to Criterion, regardless of whether new commentary tracks were produced.

===Special editions===
The Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) on LaserDisc, the latter&#x27;s source negatives courtesy of the Library of Congress. The company later became known for pioneering the &quot;special edition&quot; DVD concept containing bonus materials such as trailers, commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings and deleted scenes. The success of these releases established the special-edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of advanced film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published higher-quality versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954).

===Film restoration===
Originally, Criterion released art, genre and mainstream movies on LaserDisc such as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing world cinema, mainstream cinema classics and critically successful obscure films. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions, such as those for &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928), &quot;M&quot; (1931), &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (1945), &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) and &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973). Almost every title contains film-cleaning and film-restoration essays in the booklets, while some even have featurettes comparing the restored and unrestored images.

===Licenses===
Some previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987), &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992), &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989) and &quot;Ran&quot; (1985) became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired or when Criterion published improved versions, such as those for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), &quot;M&quot; (1931), &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (1953) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954). over 200 of the 384 titles from the List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases have been re-released.

Another example is the film &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), which had become a public-domain property for lacking the legally-required copyright notice. Criterion produced a restored edition under license from Universal Pictures for the initial edition and for the later anamorphic widescreen re-release edition of the film.

Periodically, Criterion releases material on DVD and Blu-ray disc licensed from the studios with whom the company had previously dealt (such as Universal&#x27;s and Terry Gilliam&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Brazil&quot;); these new releases are generally undertaken on a case-by-case basis.

Criterion released its first Walt Disney Pictures title, Andrew Stanton&#x27;s &quot;WALL-E&quot;, in 2022. This was not the result of an ongoing deal between Disney and Criterion, but rather licensed as a one-off, with Stanton approaching Criterion and &quot;wanting to be part of the club&quot;.

==Formats==
All Criterion titles are numbered, which is shown on the bottom of the spine of the packaging. Though the bulk of Criterion&#x27;s catalog is of live-action films, they have also released animated films (such as &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot;), television series (such as &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot;, &quot;Fishing with John&quot; and select episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;) and music videos (&quot;Beastie Boys Video Anthology&quot;).

===LaserDisc and VHS/Betamax===

The Criterion Collection began publishing LaserDiscs on December 1, 1984, with its release of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, until March 16, 1999, with Michael Bay&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon&quot; (#384). Three of the company&#x27;s early titles (&quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot;) were also issued on VHS and Betamax. These were Criterion&#x27;s only releases on those formats—other Janus/Criterion titles were often released to VHS through Home Vision Entertainment.

=== DVD and Blu-ray ===
Criterion entered the DVD market in 1998 with a reset numbering system, beginning with &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, spine #2 (&quot;Grand Illusion&quot;, #1, was delayed for a year while restoration was underway on a then-newly-found camera negative). As with its laserdiscs, Criterion&#x27;s early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not anamorphically enhance its discs for 16:9 monitors until mid-1999 with its release of &quot;Insomnia&quot; (#47).

Criterion was slow to expand into high-definition releases, partly because of the HD format wars between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Once Blu-ray had emerged as the industry-standard high-definition home-video format, Criterion began to release Blu-ray editions of select films from its collection, beginning with the Blu-ray release of Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (#453; currently out of print) on December 16, 2008. In late 2013, Criterion announced that with the November release of the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; boxset (#679), all future releases would be in dual format (DVD and Blu-ray packaged together) rather than as individual releases. This decision also applied to most upgrade re-releases introduced after November 2013. After customer feedback revealed some reluctance to this approach, &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (#724) became the last chronological spine number released as a dual-format edition, and the decision was reversed to release separate discs for titles beginning in September 2014.

Despite the emergence of Blu-ray as the industry-standard high-definition format, Janus/Criterion continues to support the DVD format. Not only are all their new Blu-ray releases accompanied by a standard-definition DVD version, but revised and upgraded releases are also released on both formats (barring the brief foray into dual-format releases). Moreover, the company&#x27;s standalone line of Eclipse releases are currently only made available in the standard DVD format.

Aside from the core catalog, the company has also released films through its Essential Art House, Eclipse, Merchant Ivory and Janus Contemporaries lines, as well as a few releases outside of any product line. Many of these releases have also been collected and sold in various box sets.

In early 2016 for the first time in its history, Criterion announced it would begin releasing its catalogue outside of the US and Canada (earlier international Criterion titles such as the Japanese LaserDisc of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; were licensed to other companies). In partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, releases began to be distributed with the launch of six titles in the U.K. during the month.
Criterion&#x27;s DVD releases are a mixture of NTSC-standard Region 0 (region-free) and Region 1 DVDs. Blu-ray discs are Region A-locked in North America or Region B-locked in the United Kingdom (though there are exceptions). However, when SPHE moved to Elevation Sales in the UK, the distribution moved to Spirit Entertainment.

==== Ultra HD Blu-ray ====
On August 11, 2021, Criterion announced that it would begin publishing titles on the Ultra HD Blu-ray format in November 2021. All Criterion Ultra HD Blu-ray releases will include both an Ultra HD Blu-ray copy and a regular Blu-ray copy of a film (with all the special features on the regular Blu-ray), with select releases including Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. The first such releases were announced on August 16 for a November 21 release: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (#1104, returning to the collection for the first time since 1992), &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; and &quot;Menace II Society&quot;. The company also released &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;The Piano&quot; on Ultra HD Blu-ray disc. The 2019 film &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (#1101), which was previously planned for a remastered Blu-ray release in October 2021, was delayed until November in order to also give the film an Ultra HD Blu-ray release.

=== Streaming as The Criterion Channel ===
After forays in providing titles from the Collection as streaming video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with other companies – Mubi (formerly &quot;The Auteurs&quot;, 2008), Hulu Plus (2011–2016) and TCM&#x27;s FilmStruck (2016–2018) – Criterion titles found themselves without an online home when FilmStruck announced it would be shutting down on November 29, 2018. The company stated in a blog post that it was &quot;trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible&quot;.

A month later, Criterion announced their own standalone subscription service, The Criterion Channel available to subscribers in the United States and Canada. The service began on April 8, 2019. The Channel&#x27;s offerings include rotating playlists, temporarily licensed films (and some television offerings) from a variety of studios and rights holders alongside streaming editions of Criterion Collection releases replete with special features. The Channel also hosts some original content, including academic overviews and curated introductions as well as featuring some Janus-owned titles that have yet to be released on physical media. Criterion maintains a close relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s streaming platform Max, which frequently also houses Criterion-released titles.

<doc id="1129403" wikidata="Q1195911" url="?curid=1129403" title="Yuko Nakazawa">
<text>is a Japanese pop and enka singer, and actress, best known as one of the original members of the all-female J-pop group Morning Musume. She is also a member of Japanese pop group Dream Morning Musume.

== Biography ==
Yuko Nakazawa was born in Kyoto Prefecture. She was one of five runners-up in a 1997 talent contest for a new Japanese pop idol. After the contest, musician and producer Tsunku offered Nakazawa and the four other runners-up (Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Aya Ishiguro, and Asuka Fukuda) the chance to be taken under his wing under one condition: they must sell 50,000 CDs of their debut song &quot;Ai no Tane&quot; with five days of live promotion. The quintet accomplished that task in four and thus Morning Musume was born. The group has since grown increasingly popular, it maintains a &quot;school-like&quot; system for their continuous line-up changes, with older members &quot;graduating&quot; and new, usually younger, members selected from nationwide auditions admitted to the group almost annually.

In 1998, shortly after Morning Musume&#x27;s formation, Nakazawa began a solo career, beginning with enka styled songs. She gradually moved to a more pop sound, but has recently gone back to enka with her eleventh single, &quot;Urara.&quot; Her solo work has allowed her voice to shine in a way it rarely did in Morning Musume, as she mostly sung harmonies with only a few solo lines.

Nakazawa has been a regular featured singer on Hello! Project&#x27;s &quot;Folk Songs&quot; series. She was also placed in Akagumi 4 in Hello! Project&#x27;s 2000 summer shuffles and Puripuri Pink in Hello!Project&#x27;s 2005 summer shuffles, as well as participating in H.P. All Stars along with most of the rest of Hello!Project in 2004.

Being the oldest of the 1st generation of Morning Musume—she was 24 at the time of formation and nearly 28 upon leaving the group—Nakazawa held the role of the group&#x27;s leader until her graduation on April 15, 2001. She has cited her reasons for leaving as being her age (she was 14 years older than the youngest member of the troupe, then 13-year-old Ai Kago, at the time of her departure) and her desire to pursue other things by the time she was 30.

Since then, Nakazawa has done some work in Japanese dramas such as &quot;Beauty 7&quot; and &quot;Home Maker&quot;, performed in various plays, and continued in her solo singing career at a steady pace with reasonable success. She worked closely with Morning Musume and hosted their weekly show &quot;Hello! Morning&quot; (first regularly, then occasionally), until its end in early 2007.

It was announced on October 19, 2008, by Hello! Project that Nakazawa, along with the rest of Elder Club will graduate from Hello! Project on March 31, 2009. On February 1, 2009, during the &quot;Hello Pro Award &#x27;09 ~Elder Club Sotsugyō Kinen Special~&quot; concert held at Yokohama Arena, Nakazawa passed on her leadership position in Hello! Project to Ai Takahashi of Morning Musume.

In 2010, it was announced Yuko Nakazawa will be joining the new group, &quot;Dream Morning Musume&quot; alongside other former-Morning Musume members.

==Personal life==
In March 2012, it was announced that Nakazawa had married an information technology company president one year her senior in a private ceremony. They have two little boys.

<doc id="1129408" wikidata="Q362291" url="?curid=1129408" title="Bodkin point">
<text>A bodkin point is a type of arrowhead. In its simplest form it is an uncomplicated squared metal spike, and was used extensively during the Middle Ages. The typical bodkin was a square-section arrowhead, generally up to long and thick at its widest point, tapered down behind this initial &quot;punch&quot; shape. Bodkin arrows complemented traditional broadhead arrows, as bodkin point arrows were designed to defeat mail armor while broadhead point arrows caused more serious wounds and tissue damage.

==History ==
The name comes from the Old English word or , a type of sharp, pointed dagger. Arrows of the long bodkin type were used by the Vikings and continued to be used throughout the Middle Ages. The bodkin point eventually fell out of use during the 16th and 17th centuries, as armour largely ceased to be worn and firearms took over from archery.

==Armour penetration==
It has been suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour. Bodkins had greater ability to pierce mail armour than broadheads, and historical accounts do speak of bodkin arrows shot from close range piercing plate armour.

In a modern test, a direct hit from a steel bodkin point penetrated mail armour from a range of seven yards. However, the test was conducted without a padded jack or gambeson, which was layered cloth armour worn under heavier armour for protection against projectiles.

Armour of the medieval era was not completely proof against arrows until the specialised armour of the Italian city-state mercenary companies. Archery was thought not to be effective against plate armour in the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross (1346), the Battle of Bergerac (1345), and the Battle of Poitiers (1356); such armour became available to European knights and men at arms of fairly modest means by the late 14th century, though never to all soldiers in any army.

Testing by Matheus Bane in 2006 and David Jones in 2014 demonstrated that a bodkin point arrow fired from longbow of ~75 pound draw weight at a distance of 10 yards could penetrate both gambeson and mail armor. In addition, Bane&#x27;s testing demonstrated that a bodkin point arrow would also be able to penetrate plate armor of minimum thickness (1.2 mm), although likely not lethally. However, the arrowheads used in the Bane test were made of steel, while research by the Royal Armouries and the Historical Metallurgy Society suggests that a majority of medieval arrowheads were made from wrought iron instead.

Computer analysis by Mariusz Magier, Adrian Nowak and others published in 2017 found that heavy bodkin point arrows could penetrate typical plate armour of the time at . The depth of penetration would be slight at that range but would increase as the range closed or against armour lesser than the best quality available at the time.

In August 2019, the YouTube channel &#x27;Tod&#x27;s Workshop&#x27;, together with historian Tobias Capwell (curator at the Wallace collection), Joe Gibbs (archer), Will Sherman (fletcher), and Kevin Legg (armourer) ran a practical test using a reproduction of a 15th century plate breastplate over a chainmail and gambeson against a 160 lbf (710 N) longbow. Both wrought iron and case hardened arrows were fired at the target from a distance of 25 meters. In contrast to the earlier computer analysis, neither arrow type successfully penetrated the breastplate.

<text>Sakia Gunn (May 26, 1987 – May 11, 2003) was a 15-year-old African American lesbian who was murdered in what has been deemed a hate crime in Newark, New Jersey. Richard McCullough, was charged with her death and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 2008, a documentary was released about Gunn&#x27;s murder, titled &quot;Dreams Deferred: The Sakia Gunn Film Project&quot;.

==Murder==
On the night of May 11, 2003, Gunn was returning from a night out in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, with her friends and cousin. While waiting for the #1 New Jersey Transit bus at the corner of Broad and Market Streets in downtown Newark, Gunn and her friends were propositioned by two men. The girls rejected their advances and declared themselves to be lesbians. The men attacked; Gunn fought back, and one of the men, Richard McCullough, stabbed her in the chest. Both men immediately fled the scene in their vehicle. After Gunn&#x27;s cousin, Valencia Bailey, flagged down a passing driver, she was taken to nearby University Hospital, where she died in the arms of Valencia Bailey in the parking lot of University Hospital.

==Sentencing==
McCullough, who turned himself in to authorities several days later, was arrested in connection with the crime on May 16, 2003. In a plea bargain, the murder charges were dropped and, on March 3, 2005, McCullough pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter, aggravated assault, and bias intimidation, though claiming, at one point, that Gunn died after she &quot;ran into his knife&quot;; which was a lie. On April 21, 2005, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released from prison on May 13, 2020.

==Reaction and Gunn&#x27;s legacy==
Gunn&#x27;s death was the subject of a two-day series in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in October 2004 by Anne Hull, who spent months reporting on the lives of young lesbians in Newark in the aftermath of the hate crime that killed their friend. The series was finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing in 2005.

Using the LexisNexis database, Kim Pearson, a professor at The College of New Jersey compared the media coverage of Sakia Gunn&#x27;s death to the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard: 659 stories were found in major newspapers about Shepard&#x27;s murder, compared to 21 articles about Gunn&#x27;s murder in the subsequent seven months. Pearson noted that not only were Shepard&#x27;s attackers tried and convicted during this period, but that it took nearly that long for Gunn&#x27;s attacker to be indicted.

Gunn&#x27;s death sparked outrage from the city&#x27;s gay and lesbian community. The community, in conjunction with GLAAD, rallied the mayor&#x27;s office, requesting, among other things, the establishment of a gay and lesbian community center, that police officers to patrol the Newark Penn Station/Broad Street corridor 24-hours a day, the creation of an LGBT advisory council to the mayor, and that the school board be held accountable for the lack of concern and compassion when dealing with students at Westside High School (which Gunn attended) immediately following the murder. The Newark Pride Alliance, an LGBT advocacy group, was founded in the wake of Gunn&#x27;s murder.

In 2008, a documentary was released about Gunn&#x27;s murder, titled &quot;Dreams Deferred: The Sakia Gunn Film Project&quot;.

In 2023, Newark’s Academy Street was renamed Sakia Gunn Way.

<doc id="1129418" wikidata="Q219509" url="?curid=1129418" title="Saddell">
<text>Saddell (, ) is a small Scottish village situated on the east side of the Kintyre Peninsula of Argyll and Bute, overlooking the Kilbrannan Sound and the Isle of Arran, from Campbeltown on the B842 road to Carradale. The name Saddell is derived from the Norse for sandy dale.

==Saddell Abbey==

Saddell is home to the ruins of a Cistercian Abbey. This was founded around 1160 by Somerled and completed by his son, whose descendants became the Clan MacDonald and eventual Lords of the Isles. Stone carving was a speciality at Saddell, and fine examples of carved medieval grave slabs are displayed under cover in the grounds of the abbey, now a cemetery. Relief carvings on the stones show warriors in their armour, clerics, ships, huntsmen with stags, large swords, and Celtic knotwork designs. Most were carved at Saddell Abbey, but some are more typical of the Iona school of stone-carving.

==Saddell Castle==

Saddell Castle, a tower house to the southeast and nearer the shore, was built for the Bishop of Argyll in the early 16th century. When the Campbells took it over in the late 17th century, stone from the abbey was used to add farm buildings to the castle. The family moved into a new house nearby around 1774, and the castle deteriorated over the years before being bought by the Landmark Trust. In 1976, the Landmark Trust contracted Mr Robert R Mauchline to restore the castle to its former glory. Soon after its completion, the castle appeared in Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; music video. Mr Mauchline&#x27;s daughters Joanna and Hazel were also featured in the video.

The Trust now owns both Saddell Castle and the newer Saddell House, allowing pedestrian access to the beach below Saddell Bay.

==Kildonan Dun==

At the end of Saddell Bay is Pluck Wood and the remains of Kildonan Dun, a late Iron Age hillfort dating from 200BC and made from Stone.

In contrast to the mostly round Duns, it has a D-shaped ground plan, like Barsalloch Fort and Castle Haven in Galloway. The Dun measures about within the outer two, one-meter high and two-meter thick ring wall. The impressive entrance, with its well-recognizable door construction, is in the southwest. The double staircase on the rampart, located within the wall on the west side, and a round wall niche in the northeast are intact. In form and design, some novelties are shown, as occurred with Brochs in the same period.

The excavation of Dun Kildonan between 1936 and 1938 resulted in a precise chronology. Objects from the 1st and 2nd centuries demonstrate the time of construction of the dun, while objects from the 6th and 9th to 12th centuries or later times show that the central square also remained an important focus. The finds are located in the Campbeltown Museum.

<text>Princess Konstancja Czartoryska (c. 1696 or 29 January 1700 – 27 October 1759) was a Polish-Lithuanian noblewoman and the mother of King Stanisław II August of Poland. She played a political role as a driving force within the Familia (political party).

==Life==
She was the daughter of magnate Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski and his wife, Izabela Elżbieta Morsztyn. She was given a fashionable French-influenced education. She married Stanisław Poniatowski on 14 September 1720. The marriage was arranged by the assistance of Jakub Henryk Flemming as an alliance between the Poniatowski and Czartoryski family. After marriage, she frequently attended the royal court.

Konstancja Czartoryska came to acquire a great influence within the family and was described as a driving force behind the political career of her spouse and her brothers. Through the connections she made at court, she could benefit the career of her brothers. She reportedly persuaded August Czartoryski to leave Imperial employ. At the interregnum and royal election after the death of king August II in 1733, Konstancja Czartoryska, alongside her mother and Maria Zofia Czartoryska, are described as the most influential people in the Familia Party. The French ambassador initiated negotiations with her regarding the election of Stanisław Leszczyński in connection to Stanisław Poniatowski and Józef Potocki.

In September 1733, she left Warsaw with her family and spent the War of the Polish Succession in Gdańsk. She is described as a serious person with an interest in education and politics and strongly devoted to her mother, and reportedly made sure that her children be given a good education, in contrast to what was often the case in contemporary Poland. In January 1736, she visited Koszalin and successfully persuaded Michał Czartoryski to support August III as king. She returned permanently to Warsaw in 1739.

Konstancja Czartoryska devoted a lot of her time to politics, mainly to secure the alliance between her and her husband&#x27;s family as a united political party, and she is depicted in the diary of Stanisław August as always attending the family meetings, where she was a driving force in the party&#x27;s political policy; often supporting Michał Czartoryski, but rephrasing his emotional outbursts and discussing the issues in a more constructive tone with August Czartoryski.
In 1743, she was involved in the scandal when her son was Kazimierz challenged to a duel by Adam Tarła after having danced with Tarla&#x27;s wife. After her son escaped the first duel unharmed, she allegedly told her son that she would rather see him dead than covered in shame. This led to the second duel, in which Tarla was killed in the famed Marymont-duel. In 1745, she resolved the conflict between Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski and Czerniak Stanisławs and Antoni Lubomirski. 
In 1752, the wife of the French ambassador, countess de Broglie, accused her of being behind the poisoning of L.A Duperron de Castér and described her as a person capable of anything. In 1753, she called her son back from France and supported him being sent to Russia in cooperation with Ch. H. Williams.

In 1755, she lost her political influence within the family political party because of her opposition to a Polish participation in the Seven Years&#x27; War and discord with her brothers, who no longer respected her opinions. The death of her mother caused her to fall in to depression and a greater interest in religion.

==In culture==
She was portrayed in a novel by Maria Dernałowicz, &quot;Portret Familia&quot; (W. 1974).

<text>This article describes the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which prohibited it. Torture is prohibited by international law and is illegal in most countries. However, it is still used by many governments.

Torture is widely practiced worldwide: Amnesty International received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2001. These accusations concerned acts against political prisoners in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries. State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at collective memory and reconciliation in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture &quot;is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim&#x27;s personality and identity.&quot; When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment.

While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including plausible deniability, secret police, &quot;need to know&quot;, denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a jurisdictional argument, claim of &quot;overriding need&quot;, the use of torture by proxy, and so on. Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming hearsay and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions. UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir Nigel Rodley, believes that &quot;impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture.&quot;

While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many non-state actors also engage in it. These include paramilitaries and guerrillas, criminal actors such as organized crime syndicates and kidnappers.

A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as waterboarding, sexual humiliation and sexual abuse, and dogs to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of stun belts and tasers have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to &quot;control&quot; prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture.

==Technology==
Methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years. The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques. 

==Inter-state collaboration==

Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the Phoenix Program, the United States helped South Vietnam co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on interrogation that extended to the use of torture (see U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to &quot;coercive techniques&quot;.

The southern cone governments of South America – Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil – involved in Operation Condor co-ordinated the disappearance, torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.

The United States government has, at least since the Bush administration, used the tactic of legal rendition in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the &quot;war on terror&quot; this has evolved into extraordinary rendition, the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are South Africa, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to kidnapping for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the Washington Post reported — citing administration sources — that such facilities are operated by the CIA in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries. Human Rights Watch reports that planes associated with rendition have landed repeatedly in Poland and Romania.

==Recent instances of torture in selected countries==
The use of torture is geographically widespread. A review by Amnesty International, which did not use the United Nations Convention Against Torture as its definition of torture, of its case files found &quot;reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000&quot;. These reports described widespread or persistent patterns of abuse in more than 70 countries and torture-related deaths in more than 80.

===Afghanistan===

Torture has been reported in Afghanistan under each of its recent governments. Under Najibullah&#x27;s Soviet-backed regime, beating and electric shocks were widely reported. After the mujahidin victory, Afghanistan fell into a state of chaos, and, according to Amnesty International, &quot;Torture of civilians in their homes has become endemic ... In almost every jail run by the armed political groups, torture is reported to be a part of the daily routine&quot;. The Taliban are likewise reported to have engaged in torture. Since the U.S. overthrow of the Taliban, torture has been reported on several occasions, both by Afghan groups and by U.S. troops. In the Herat region, dominated by the warlord Ismail Khan, Human Rights Watch reported extensive torture in 2002. Torture by US troops has been alleged in news reports by the New York Times. In March 2008 the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that they and the Afghan army had uncovered a Taliban torture chamber where two individuals were believed to have been beaten.

===Albania===
Under Enver Hoxha&#x27;s People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania, torture was widely used by police and prison camp guards. Since the fall of communism, Amnesty International has reported police abuses amounting to torture; the government says it has &quot;made efforts to punish all acts of torture under the Albanian criminal justice system&quot;. In 2020 more than 3000 Albanians signed a petition accusing the government of Edi Rama of torture against the Muslim cleric Genci Balla who was isolated under the article 41-bis prison regime in solitary confinement and deprived of halal food.

===Algeria===
According to Pierre Vidal-Naquet in &quot;Torture; Cancer of Democracy&quot; and &quot;Les Damnees de la Terre&quot; by Franz Fanon, torture was practiced endemically by the French forces, commanded by General Jacques Massu, bringing together the experience of &quot;Les Paras&quot; in the Indo-China War and German troops in the French Foreign Legion. One of the most notorious methods was the &quot;gegène&quot;, or generator, in which victims were tied down and electrocuted with a primitive device that delivered electric shocks to the genitalia.

===Angola===
In Angola&#x27;s 27-year civil war, according to Amnesty International, &quot;many were tortured&quot; by both sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;E/CN.4/1994/31&quot;&gt;&quot;Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;, U.N. Commission on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, AI has also reported that &quot;unarmed civilians are being extrajudicially executed and tortured&quot; in Angola&#x27;s war against Cabindan separatists.

===Argentina===
During the so-called &quot;Dirty War&quot; carried out in the 1970s, in particular, but not only, by the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, tens of thousands of Argentines were &quot;disappeared&quot; by the junta, many never to be seen again. The National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons concluded:

In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the methodology of repression. Secret torture centres were set up, among other reasons, to enable the carrying out of torture to be carried out undisturbed.

===Bahrain===
Torture has been used frequently by the Bahraini government in the 20th century. Notable cases include that of Ian Henderson, a former colonial officer employed in Bahrain who was accused by multiple witnesses of torturing prisoners. Adel Flaifel, a notorious security officer identified by many detainees as having overseen torture, was given immunity under Royal Decree 56 of 2002. Between 1980 and 1998, nine people died in detention as a result of torture, with five more dying shortly after being released as a result of injuries sustained from torture. Reports released by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the 1990s point to the widespread use of torture in Bahraini prisons.

During the Bahraini uprising, torture was described by many human rights reports as widespread and systematic. Up to 1866 who make up 64% of detainees reported cases of torture. Three government agencies, namely the Ministry of Interior, the National Security Agency and the Bahrain Defence Force, were involved in interrogating detainees in relation to the events of the uprising. The NSA and MoI followed a systematic practice of physical and psychological mistreatment, which in many cases amounted to torture. Only four of the individuals who alleged torture were arrested by the BDF. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry have attributed the deaths of five individuals to torture.

===Brazil===
Torture was used regularly by the Brazilian dictatorship regime from 1964 to 1977 against dissidents. It included torturing their children, some of whom were less than 2 years old at the time.

===Cambodia===
Torture was used by the Khmer Rouge at the S-21 Prison.

===Cameroon===
===Chile===

The regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile in the 1970s used torture extensively against political opponents. Chile&#x27;s National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture (Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura) concluded in 2004 that torture had been a systematically implemented policy of the government, and recommended reparations. The commission heard the testimony of more than 35,000 witnesses, whose testimonies are to be kept secret for fifty years. Among those tortured were future president Michelle Bachelet, who was held along with her mother at the notorious Villa Grimaldi detention center in the capital Santiago.

===China===

Although torture was outlawed in China in 1996, a UN investigator found torture to still be widespread in 2005, particularly because the narrow definition of the law, leaving a mark, does not comply with the UN definition.

Torture is reportedly used as part of the indoctrination process at the Xinjiang internment camps.

===Cuba===

People imprisoned by the communist regime are reportedly tortured.

===East Germany===
In the socialist German Democratic Republic of divided Germany, torture and inhumane and degrading treatment were systematically used by security forces, including the Stasi secret police, against suspected opponents of the regime.

===France===

During the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962), the French military used torture against the National Liberation Front and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered electrical generators on suspects: this form of torture was called &quot;(la) gégène&quot;.

That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film &quot;Death Squadrons: The French School&quot; by Monique Robin.
The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture &quot;universities&quot; at &quot;Poulo Condor&quot; (now &quot;Côn Sơn&quot;) – an island off Vietnam (then French Indo-China, subsequently taken over by the United States) and at Philippeville (now &quot;Skikda&quot;) in Algeria.

Police abuse remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees. Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the Inspector General of the National Police received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for &quot;inhumane and degrading treatments&quot; in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs. The head of the police station in Saint-Denis, near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders. Nine investigations concerning police abuse in this police station were carried out in 2005 by the IGS inspection of police. These repeated abuses are said to be one of the causes of the 2005 civil unrest. Conditions in detention centers for illegal aliens have also been widely criticized by human rights NGOs. In 2006 a 20-year-old Serbian woman accused a policeman of attempting to rape her in such a centre in Bobigny, in the suburbs of Paris, the year before.

===Guatemala===
During the Guatemalan civil war and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even genocide), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the CIA, in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the Cold War). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, Dianna Ortiz, an American nun who was teaching poor Mayan children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in Guatemala City in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, &quot;The Blindfold&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. &quot;There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well&quot;, wrote Dianna Ortiz.

===India===
India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The Asian Centre for Human Rights released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi. The report stated that, taking 2000 as the base year, custodial deaths have decreased by 41.66% government between 2004–2005 to 2007–2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison and 12.60% increase while in police custody.
The government has stated that it intends to pass the Anti Torture Act 2010 so it can ratify the UN convention against torture. The bill provides up to a 10-year sentence for physical or mental torture by the police.

===Iran===

Article 38 of the constitution of the Islamic Republic forbids &quot;all forms of torture for the purpose of extracting confession or acquiring information&quot; and the &quot;compulsion of individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath.&quot; It also states that &quot;any testimony, confession, or oath obtained under duress is devoid of value and credence.&quot; The Islamic Republic itself vehemently denies the existence of torture by the government.

Nonetheless, human rights groups and observers, such as Amnesty International, the United Nations, and Human Rights Watch, have complained that torture is frequently used on political prisoners in Iran.

A substantial number of Iranians have been tortured and imprisoned by the religious police. Arya Aramnejad, a singer, was jailed for his song &quot;Ali Barkhiz&quot; where he denounces the Islamic regime&#x27;s crimes during the 2009 Ashura protests. During his time in prison, he was reportedly tortured (sexually humiliated – photographed naked, laughed at, obliged to walk barefooted on aids&#x27; patients blood). Farzad Kamangar was repeatedly tortured in prison. Amnesty International reports that Kamangar was repeatedly beaten, flogged, and electrocuted, and that he now suffers from spasms in his arms and legs as a result of the torture. After she died in the custody of Iranian officials, Zahra &quot;Ziba&quot; Kazemi-Ahmadabadi, an Iranian-Canadian freelance photographer, was found to show obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, broken nose, signs of rape and severe abdominal bruising. Ehsan Fatahian, an Iranian Kurdish activist, was tortured for confession before being executed. Zeynab Jalalian, also a Kurdish activist, is currently ill due to prison conditions and torture. She has been sentenced to death. Other notable victims include Behrouz Javid Tehrani, Habibollah Latifi, Houshang Asadi, Saeed Malekpour, Shirkoh (Bahman) Moarefi, Hossein Khezri, and Akbar Mohammadi.

In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian Ervand Abrahamian included Iran along with &quot;Stalinist Russia, Maoist China, and early modern Europe&quot; of the Inquisition and witch hunts, as societies that &quot;can be considered to be in a league of their own&quot; in the systematic use of torture.

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.

Chronicle of Higher Education International, reports that the widespread practice of raping women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students &quot;less outspoken and less likely to take part&quot; in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, &quot;most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can&#x27;t cope with that.&quot;

Several bills passed the Iranian Parliament that would have had Iran joining the international convention on banning torture in 2003 when reformists controlled Parliament, but were rejected by the Guardian Council.

===Iraq===
The government headed by Baathist Saddam Hussein made extensive use of torture, including at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison.

The post-invasion Iraqi government holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, Human Rights Watch found that torture was &quot;routine and commonplace.&quot; According to their report,

Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into Saddam Hussein&#x27;s plastic shredder (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had &quot;thrown babies from incubators&quot; during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the &#x27;eyewitness testimony&#x27; of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, Nurse Nayirah. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah, Kuwait&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.

===Israel===
In 1987, Israel became the only country in the world where torture was considered legal.

After investigation of continued allegations of torture, the Supreme Court made another ruling in 1999 that curtailed the use of torture, but controversially allowed a necessity defense for agents of the state accused of torture. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, Amnesty International continued to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remained unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. Amnesty International stated in 2002:

In 2018 another decision loosened the criteria for torture being excused and further enabled the institutionalization of torture.

The human rights group B&#x27;Tselem estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism were subject to prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged sight deprivation or sensory deprivation; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In January 2000, B&#x27;Tselem claimed that the Israeli General Security Service&#x27;s (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the five techniques: &quot;[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971...&quot;

===Italy===
===Kenya===

Mau Mau inflicted torture and death on 1,819 Kikuyu during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent.

===Lebanon===
Suspected Hezbollah guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) prison at Khiam in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.

===Nigeria===
In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of Enugu, Lagos and Kano routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.

Systematic torture was used in conjunction with military occupation in an attempt to quell anti-oil protests by the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta, according to a World Council of Churches report.

Christian pastors in Nigeria have been involved in the torturing and killing of children accused of witchcraft. Church pastors, in an effort to distinguish from the competition, establish their credentials by accusing children of witchcraft. When repeatedly asked to comment about the matter, the Church has refused to comment.

===North Korea===
Torture is widespread and used with impunity in North Korea&#x27;s system of prisons and forced labor camps. Guards have the power to inflict severe beatings, simulated drownings, stress positions, starvation, confinement in small spaces, hanging by the wrists or ankles, electric shocks, and sexual abuse.

===North Vietnam===
From 1961 to 1973, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong held hundreds of Americans captive. Hanoi&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security&#x27;s Medical Office (MPSMO) was responsible for &quot;preparing studies and performing research on the most effective Soviet, French, Communist Chinese and other ...techniques...&quot; of extracting information from POWs. The MPSMO &quot;...supervised the use of torture and the use of drugs to induce [American] prisoners to cooperate.&quot; Its functions also &quot;...included working with Soviet and Communist Chinese intelligence advisors who were qualified in the use of medical techniques for intelligence purposes.&quot;

See Con Son Island for accounts of US torture practices.

===Palestinian Territories===

The Palestinian Authority has reportedly practiced torture in the Palestinian territories over the years. Amnesty International found: &quot;Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of detainees remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported.&quot;

In 1995, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized American citizen, was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. He was subsequently taken to a prison in Jericho where he was tortured and killed. Rahim&#x27;s family attempted to sue the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization, but the Supreme Court ultimately ruled against them.

More than 100 cases of torture by Palestinian security services were reported in 2010. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;The reports of torture by Palestinian security services keep rolling in. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are well aware of the situation. They need to reverse this rampant impunity and make sure that those responsible are prosecuted.&quot;

At least six Palestinians died under torture in PA prisons. According to a report by the Arab Organization for Human Rights in Britain, the PA has used torture on a systematic basis for years. Methods include beatings with cables, pulling out nails, suspension from the ceiling, flogging, kicking, cursing, electric shocks, sexual harassment and the threat of rape. The report went on to say &quot;Every one of those detainees has been subject to humiliating and degrading treatment and stayed in cells for more than 10 days. The analysis shows that an astonishing 95 percent of the detainees were subjected to severe torture, others feeling the detrimental effects on their health for varying periods.&quot; The &quot;shabeh&quot;, which involves detainees being handcuffed and bound in stress positions for longs stretches of time, is the most widely used form of torture.

In 2012, after allegedly selling a house in Hebron to a Jewish family, Muhammad Abu Shahala was arrested by the Palestinian Authority, tortured into a confession, and sentenced to death.

Human Rights Watch reported 147 cases of torture by Hamas in the West Bank during 2011 and that none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted &quot;despite consistent allegations of severe abuse.&quot; It further stated that &quot;Some men said they had needed medical care due to torture and sought to obtain medical records as evidence that they had been tortured, but that hospital officials refused to provide them. Hamas&#x27;s rival in the West Bank, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse.&quot;

In another report, Human Rights Watch &quot;documents cases in which [Palestinian] security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment, and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza.&quot; HRW also reported an incident in which &quot;the Hamas Ministry of Interior summoned a journalist who published an article on torture by Hamas authorities in secret detention facilities, threatened to take legal action against him if he did not publish an apology for the article, and warned him to correct his &#x27;biased&#x27; reporting.&quot;

===Papua New Guinea===
Despite international and national exposure, torture in Papua remains widespread and systematic; it is also surrounded by virtually complete impunity and denial. A study by the International Journal of Conflict and Violence found 431 cases of torture in Papua New Guinea.

===Philippines===
During the rule of Ferdinand Marcos, torture and degrading treatment were routine in police custody. Political prisoners were often beaten, burned with irons, placed in stress positions, sexually abused, and subjected to electric shock, among other severe methods.

===Portugal===
During the Estado Novo in Portugal, the secret police is known to have used torture on political prisoners. Detainees were forced to remain standing for hours on end in a method called the &quot;statue&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;estátua&quot;), were kept in cramped, wet cells with no natural light, were beaten during trials, faced threats against themselves and their family members, or were forced to listen to the same music or sounds for extended periods of time. These practices were revealed in an inquiry and subsequent investigation and trial of secret police practices in 1957.

=== Romania ===

Under the communist regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and later that of Nicolae Ceaușescu, torture was often used against political and religious prisoners, including those incarcerated during the notorious Pitești Experiment.

Torture as a penalty was abolished after the fall of the communist regime.

From 2003 through 2005, during the War on Terror, Romania hosted a secret CIA black site where prisoners were tortured.

===Russia===

The Constitution of Russia forbids arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. Part 2 of Article 21 of the Constitution states that &quot;no one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other harsh or humiliating treatment or punishment...&quot;. However Russian police are regularly observed practicing tortureincluding beatings, electric shocks, rape, asphyxiationin interrogating arrested suspects.

Torture and humiliation, or &quot;dedovshchina&quot;, are also widespread in Russian&#x27;s military, according to Human Rights Watch. This is essentially the Russian version of bullying or hazing that is practiced in the American military, however it is often much more brutal. Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of it. Amnesty International reported on allegations of Chechen locals, that Russian military forces in Chechnya rape and torture local women with electric shocks, when electric wires are connected to the straps of their bra on their chest.

In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, and raped by special police forces (&quot;Red Terror&quot;). Such incidents took place not only in Chechnya, but also in the Russian towns of Blagoveshensk, Bezetsk, and Nefteyugansk.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia officially considers torture illegal under Islamic Law; however, it is widely practiced, as in the case of William Sampson. According to a 2003 report by Amnesty International, &quot;torture and ill-treatment remained rife.&quot; Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, stated in 2002 &quot;The practice of torture in Saudi Arabia is well documented&quot;, According to the Human Rights Watch &quot;World Report 2003&quot;, &quot;Torture under interrogation of political prisoners and criminal suspects continued&quot;, and the 2006 report notes that &quot;Arbitrary detention, mistreatment and torture of detainees, restrictions on freedom of movement, and lack of official accountability remain serious concerns&quot;.

===South Africa===
According to Amnesty International, torture takes place in police stations, prisons, detention centres and beyond. During 2014/2015, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) investigated 145 new reported cases it described as torture, 34 cases listed as rape and 3,711 cases listed as assault by police officers. Of the 145 cases described as torture, only four were referred to the National Prosecuting Authority by IPID for criminal charges during that same time period. This reflects serious problems with accountability.

===Soviet Union===
Torture was widely practiced by the brutal Cheka during the early days of the Red Army, followed by the Soviet NKVD during the early Stalinist era to extract (often false) confessions from suspects often called enemies of the people. One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was sleep deprivation, nicknamed &quot;conveyor&quot; due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping. The use of torture was authorized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and personally by Joseph Stalin. During the Doctor&#x27;s Plot, Stalin ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured &quot;to death&quot;. Torture was still used after Stalin by the KGB but not on the same extent and level.

===Spain===
Torture was widespread against dissidents and those associated with them in the years that Francisco Franco ruled Spain. Such abuses continued into the 1970s and included severe beatings and waterboarding.

The Spanish kingdom today categorically denies the existence of torture. However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern &quot;about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints.&quot; It further indicated that &quot;all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention&quot; (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).

===Syria===
Torture has reportedly been used in the Adra Prison near Damascus. In 2010, the prison held 7,000 prisoners. The Tadmor Prison in Palmyra was known for harsh conditions, extensive human rights abuse, torture and summary executions. It was closed in 2001 and all remaining political detainees were transferred to other prisons in Syria. However, Tadmor Prison was reopened on 15 June 2011 and 350 individuals arrested for participation in anti-regime demonstrations were transferred there for interrogation and detainment.

A number of captured Israelis have been tortured in Syria. This includes Eli Cohen, who was executed in 1965. In 1955, five Israeli soldiers were captured in a covert operation on the Golan Heights and brutally tortured in a Syrian prison. One of the soldiers, Uri Ilan, committed suicide when falsely informed by his captors that his comrades had been killed. Ilan became a symbol of courage and patriotism in Israel. During the Yom Kippur War, many Israeli prisoners said that they had been tortured by Syrians, and one POW, Avraham Lanir, was tortured to death after he refused to disclose information about the Israeli nuclear arsenal.

During the Syrian Civil War, reports have been made of widespread and systematic torture used by Syrian security forces. This includes electrocution, brutal beatings and sexual assault. Amnesty said of the situation : &quot;Torture and other ill-treatment in Syria form part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, carried out in an organized manner and as part of state policy and therefore amount to crimes against humanity.&quot; In February 2019, two Syrians were arrested in Germany on suspicion of having conducted or abetted torture for the regime of Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian Civil War.

===United Arab Emirates===
In April 2009, a video emerged of a United Arab Emirates Royal Sheik, Sheik Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan (a son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan) directing the torture of Afghan grain dealer Mohammed Shah Poor. The video includes the man being tortured with a cattle prod to his genitals, sand in his mouth and being run over by a Mercedes SUV. A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim&#x27;s arms and legs, and later holding him down. The official response of the UAE government was that Sheik Issa is the man shown in the video but he did nothing wrong. The incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behaviour, the Ministry of the Interior said.

====Kenya====
During the 1950&#x27;s, a rebellion against British rule in Kenya known as the Mau Mau rebellion broke out, spearheaded by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (better known as the &quot;Mau Mau&quot;). During their suppression of the rebellion, British security forces routinely used torture on suspected Mau Mau insurgents. Upon discovering that nearly the entire Kikiyu population numbering over a million had taken an oath to support the Mau Mau in their struggle, the British colonial authorities imprisoned suspected insurgents in concentration camps in order to try and coerce them into repudiating the Mau Mau oath; hundreds of thousands of Kikuyus were imprisoned in the camps during the rebellion. In these camps, detainees were frequently subject to brutal mistreatment, including torture, by camp wardens and prison guard. These included methods such as rape, mutilation, and stuffing a detainee&#x27;s mouth with mud and stamping on their throat. Instances of the wardens and guards intentionally denying medical aid to detainees were widespread, which compounded the effects of torture at the camps. A former British prison official in Kenya described a detention camp there in 1954: &quot;Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging – all in violation of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.&quot; According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary in Kenya, there was a &quot;constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration.&quot;

One of the detainees who was tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion was Hussein Onyango Obama, the grandfather of U.S. President Barack Obama. According to his widow, &quot;British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods&quot; at the Kamiti Prison. One British settler described an interrogation by the colonial police force:

On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to Governor Evelyn Baring about the &quot;inhumanity&quot; of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing:

In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the &quot;beating up and roasting alive of one African&quot;. A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects &quot;during screening operations&quot;. &quot;I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals,&quot; wrote Baring.

In 1956, Baring&#x27;s administration devised the &quot;dilution technique&quot; – a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya – and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a &quot;rough way&quot;. Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use &quot;overpowering&quot; force, and the cabinet minister&#x27;s approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the &quot;Mau Mau moan&quot; – a chant of defiance – were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the &quot;third degree&quot;. &quot;The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts.&quot;

One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of &quot;fanatical&quot; detainees at the Mwea camps.

In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony&#x27;s detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is &quot;distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia&quot;. Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, &quot;vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys&quot;, and it was important that &quot;those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate&quot;. He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that &quot;If we are going to sin,&quot; he wrote, &quot;we must sin quietly.&quot;

====Northern Ireland====
During the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland, there were instances of British security forces, including the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), using torture on suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) members. Former RUC interrogators who were active during the Troubles claimed that waterboarding, among other forms of torture, were systematically used against suspected IRA members in police custody.

In 1971, as part of Operation Demetrius, fourteen arrested men were subjected to a programme of &quot;deep interrogation&quot; at a secret interrogation centre. The interrogation methods involved sensory deprivation and were referred to as the &quot;Five Techniques&quot;. The European Court of Human Rights defined them as &quot;wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink&quot;. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept hooded and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a stress position for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.

The fourteen so-called &quot;Hooded Men&quot; were the only detainees subjected to all Five Techniques together. Some other detainees were subjected to at least one of the Five Techniques, along with other interrogation methods. These allegedly included waterboarding, electric shocks, burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, whipping the soles of the feet, and psychological abuse such as Russian roulette.

Details of the &quot;deep interrogation&quot; programme became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the British Government commissioned an inquiry, under Lord Parker, to look into the Five Techniques. In 1972 the Parker Report concluded that the Five Techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister Edward Heath, then announced that the Five Techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.

The Irish Government had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971. In 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the programme of deep interrogation, using the Five Techniques, amounted to &quot;torture&quot;. The case was then referred to the European Court of Human Rights. In 1978 it ruled that the programme amounted to &quot;inhuman and degrading treatment&quot; which breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to torture. In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the Five Techniques as torture.

The Court&#x27;s ruling, that the Five Techniques did not amount to torture, was later cited by the United States and Israel to justify their own interrogation methods.

====21st century====
On 23 February 2005, British soldiers were found guilty of abuse of Iraqi prisoners arrested for looting at a British Army camp called Bread Basket, in Basra, during May 2003. The judge at the military court, Judge Advocate Michael Hunter, said of photographs and the soldier&#x27;s behaviour:

At the court martial, the prosecution alleged that in giving the order to &quot;work [the prisoners] hard&quot;, Captain Dan Taylor had broken the Geneva Conventions. Neither Taylor, nor his commanding officer Lt-Col Paterson (who was briefed on the operation &quot;Ali Baba&quot; by Taylor), was sanctioned and, indeed, during the period of time between the offence and the trial, both were given promotions. All the leaders of the major British political parties condemned the abuse. Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, declared that the pictures were &quot;shocking and appalling&quot;. After sentencing, the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, made a statement on television and said that he was &quot;appalled and disappointed&quot; when he first saw photographs of the Iraqi detainees and that

On 7 December 2005, the House of Lords reversed the deportations of Muslims convicted on &quot;evidence procured by torture inflicted by foreign officials&quot;, and cited the 1978 case in ruling that centuries of common law and recent international conventions made torture anathema in the country&#x27;s courts. Lord Bingham said it was &quot;clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its face firmly against the use of torture&quot;; Lord Nicholls said &quot;Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country&quot;; Lord Hoffman said &quot;The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it.&quot;; Lord Hope said it was &quot;one of most evil practices known to man&quot;; Lord Rodgers said &quot;the unacceptable nature of torture ... has long been unquestioned in this country.&quot;; Lord Carswell referred to the &quot;abhorrence felt by civilised nations for the use of torture&quot;; and Lord Brown said that &quot;torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.&quot;.

On 13 March 2007, the six-month court martial of the seven soldiers – including Colonel Jorge Mendonca and Major Michael Peebles – over the detention of Iraqi prisoners in Basra during May 2003 ended with all but one, Corporal Donald Payne, being acquitted. On 30 April 2007, Payne, Britain&#x27;s first convicted war criminal found guilty under the provisions of the International Criminal Court Act 2001, who had pleaded guilty to mistreating prisoners, was jailed for a year and dishonourably discharged from the army.

In March 2008, the Ministry of Defence admitted breaching the human rights of Baha Mousa, who died in British custody in Basra, and of eight other Iraqi men held at the same facility, opening the way for a multimillion-pound compensation package for the relatives of Baha Mousa and the other men injured during illegal interrogations. On 14 May 2008, Defence Secretary Des Browne announced in the House of Commons that there would be a public inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa in which &quot;no stone [will be left] unturned in investigating his tragic death.&quot;

On 26 July 2008, the Joint Committee on Human Rights accused Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram in 2004 and Lieutenant-General Robin Brims, Commander Field Army, in 2006 of misleading the committee when they declared that conditioning practices (based on the five techniques, banned since their use in Northern Ireland in the 1970s) were not being used. It has now emerged that such techniques were being used by some troops deployed abroad. The BBC reported that &quot;Labour MP Andrew Dismore, chairman of the committee, said he hoped the public inquiry [into the death of Baha Mousa] would give some indications as to why they were given &#x27;wrong evidence&#x27;. Earlier this month, the MoD agreed to pay almost £3m in compensation to Mr Mousa&#x27;s family and nine Iraqi men after admitting breaching human rights&quot;.

===United States===

While the United States is a party to international conventions against torture, a proponent of human rights treaties and a critic of torture by other countries, torture has taken place within its borders and on its government&#x27;s behalf outside of its borders.

On 13 December 1999, NYPD officer Justin Volpe was sentenced to thirty years in prison for sodomizing detainee Abner Louima with the handle of a bathroom plunger.

The Chicago Police Department&#x27;s Area 2 unit under Commander Jon Burge repeatedly used electroshock, near-suffocation by plastic bags and excessive beating on suspects in the 1970s and 1980s. The City of Chicago&#x27;s Office of Professional Standards (OPS) concluded that the physical abuse was systematic and, &quot;The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture.&quot; The Supermax facility at the Maine State Prison has been the scene of video-taped forcible extractions that Lance Tapley in the Portland Phoenix wrote &quot;look[ed] like torture.&quot;

In 2003 and 2004, there was substantial controversy over the &quot;stress and duress&quot; methods that were used in the U.S. War on Terrorism that had been sanctioned by the U.S. Executive branch of government at Cabinet level.

Amnesty International and numerous commentators have accused the Military Commissions Act of 2006 of approving a system that uses torture, destroying the mechanisms for judicial review created by the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, and creating a parallel legal system below international standards.

In an interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the convening authority of the Guantanamo military commissions, Susan J. Crawford, a retired judge, who was responsible for reviewing practices at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, said of one Guantanamo Bay detainee, &quot;his treatment met the legal definition of torture, and that is why I did not refer the case&quot; for prosecution. The U.S. Government denies that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at Guantanamo Bay.

It was reported in June 2008 that, according to human rights lawyers, the USA was &quot;operating floating prisons to house those arrested in its war on terror&quot;:
&quot;According to research carried out by Reprieve, the US may have used as many as 17 ships as &#x27;floating prisons&#x27; since 2001. Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other, often undisclosed, locations, it is claimed. Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the USS Bataan and USS Peleliu. A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans.

... The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay, who described a fellow inmate&#x27;s story of detention on an amphibious assault ship. &#x27;One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me. He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship. They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship. The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV. The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo.&#x27;&quot;
===Uzbekistan===
After an investigating visit to Uzbekistan, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Theo van Boven concluded:

Forms of torture frequently cited include immersion in boiling water, exposure to extreme heat and cold, &quot;the use of electric shock, temporary suffocation, hanging by the ankles or wrists, removal of fingernails, punctures with sharp objects, rape, the threat of rape, and the threat of murder of family members.&quot; (For example, see Muzafar Avazov.)

In 2003, Britain&#x27;s Ambassador for Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, said that information was being extracted under extreme torture from dissidents in that country, and that the information was subsequently being used by Britain and other western, democratic countries which disapproved of torture.

===Venezuela===

Under the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, Venezuelan authorities held little regard for the human rights of citizens. Police often raided homes without search warrants and individuals were imprisoned without evidence. While initially detained, individuals faced torture in instances of interrogation. Political police targeted, arrested, tortured and killed his opponents. Those who were attacked include future Venezuelan president Rómulo Betancourt, Jaime Lusinchi and Luis Herrera Campins. Lusinchi was jailed for two months in 1952 and was beaten with a sword. According to Human Rights Watch, the Carlos Andrés Pérez administration also tortured and executed opponents with a judicial branch that largely ignored abuses by his government. The Caracas Metropolitan Police [es] and DISIP were used as tools to persecute dissenters. Following the 1992 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempts, a crackdown on alleged plotters resulted in accusations of torture by those arrested. During the Bolivarian Revolution, levels of torture occurred that had not been seen since the dictatorship of Pérez Jiménez. Following the election of Hugo Chávez, human rights in Venezuela deteriorated. By 2009, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights released a report stating that Venezuela&#x27;s government practiced &quot;repression and intolerance&quot;.
In November 2014, Venezuela appeared before the United Nations Committee Against Torture over cases between 2002 and 2014, which criticized the Venezuelan National Commission for the Prevention of Torture for being biased in favor towards the Bolivarian government. The committee had also expressed concern with &quot;beatings, burnings and electric shocks in efforts to obtain confessions&quot; that occurred during the 2014 Venezuelan protests and that of the 185 investigations for abuses during the protests, only 5 individuals had been charged. United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan E. Méndez stated on 11 March 2015 that Venezuela had ignored requests for information and that he had made &quot;conclusions based on the lack of response&quot; and &quot;concluded that the government violated the rights of prisoners&quot;, further saying that the Maduro government failed &quot;with the obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish all acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&quot;.

During the presidency of Nicolás Maduro, torture in Venezuela increased further. In La Tumba, one of the headquarters and prisons of SEBIN, has been used for white torture and some of its prisoners have attempted suicide. Conditions in La Tumba have resulted with prisoner illnesses, though Venezuelan authorities refuse to medically treat those imprisoned. Bright lights are continuously left on and prison cells are set at near-freezing temperatures.

During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, more than 290 cases of torture were documented by the Organization of American States. Human Rights Watch has documented over 350 cases of torture and abuse. Methods include severe beatings, cutting the soles of the feet with razors, partial asphyxiation, withholding food and medication, and electric shock.

===Zimbabwe===
The government of Robert Mugabe, in power from 1980 to 2017, has been accused of torturing protestors and members of the political opposition.

<text>John David Souther is the debut album American singer-songwriter JD Souther, released in 1972. The song &quot;How Long&quot; was recorded by the Eagles for their 2007 album &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, from which it was released as a single. It was a Grammy award winner for them under the &quot;Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal&quot; category. &quot;Run Like a Thief&quot; was covered by Bonnie Raitt on her album &quot;Home Plate&quot;.

==Background==
Souther was one of the first artists signed by David Geffen to Asylum Records. Souther had previously collaborated with Glenn Frey in a folk duo called Longbranch Pennywhistle. Souther later joined with Chris Hillman and Richie Furay to form the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band after the release of his solo debut. They recorded two albums before he returned to his solo career.

==Reception==

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Lindsay Planer wrote the album &quot;bears the same earthy Southwestern textures that are inextricably linked to the roots of the country/rock subgenre.&quot;

<doc id="1129436" wikidata="Q2356944" url="?curid=1129436" title="Calibrated airspeed">
<text>In aviation, calibrated airspeed (CAS) is indicated airspeed corrected for instrument and position error.

When flying at sea level under International Standard Atmosphere conditions (15 °C, 1013 hPa, 0% humidity) calibrated airspeed is the same as equivalent airspeed (EAS) and true airspeed (TAS). If there is no wind it is also the same as ground speed (GS). Under any other conditions, CAS may differ from the aircraft&#x27;s TAS and GS.

Calibrated airspeed in knots is usually abbreviated as &quot;KCAS&quot;, while indicated airspeed is abbreviated as &quot;KIAS&quot;.

In some applications, notably British usage, the expression &quot;rectified airspeed&quot; is used instead of calibrated airspeed.

==Practical applications of CAS==

CAS has two primary applications in aviation:

* for navigation, CAS is traditionally calculated as one of the steps between indicated airspeed and true airspeed;
* for aircraft control, CAS (and EAS) are the primary reference points, since they describe the dynamic pressure acting on aircraft surfaces regardless of density, altitude, wind, and other conditions. EAS is used as a reference by aircraft designers, but EAS cannot be displayed correctly at varying altitudes by a simple (single capsule) airspeed indicator. CAS is therefore a standard for calibrating the airspeed indicator such that CAS equals EAS at sea level pressure and approximates EAS at higher altitudes.

With the widespread use of GPS and other advanced navigation systems in cockpits, the first application is rapidly decreasing in importance – pilots are able to read groundspeed (and often true airspeed)
directly, without calculating calibrated airspeed as an intermediate step. The second application remains critical, however – for example, at the same weight, an aircraft will rotate and climb at approximately the same calibrated airspeed at any elevation, even though the true airspeed and groundspeed may differ significantly. These V speeds are usually given as IAS rather than CAS, so that a pilot can read them directly from the airspeed indicator.

==Calculation from impact pressure==

Since the airspeed indicator capsule responds to impact pressure, CAS is defined as a function of impact pressure alone. Static pressure and temperature appear as fixed coefficients defined by convention as standard sea level values. It so happens that the speed of sound is a direct function of temperature, so instead of a standard temperature, we can define a standard speed of sound.

For subsonic speeds, CAS is calculated as:

formula_1

where:
* formula_2 = impact pressure
* formula_3 = standard pressure at sea level
* formula_4 is the standard speed of sound at 15 °C

For supersonic airspeeds, where a normal shock forms in front of the pitot probe, the Rayleigh formula applies:

formula_5

The supersonic formula must be solved iteratively, by assuming an initial value for formula_6 equal to formula_7.

These formulae work in any units provided the appropriate values for formula_3 and formula_7 are selected. For example, formula_3 = 1013.25 hPa, formula_7 = . The ratio of specific heats for air is assumed to be 1.4.

These formulae can then be used to calibrate an airspeed indicator when impact pressure (formula_2) is measured using a water manometer or accurate pressure gauge. If using a water manometer to measure millimeters of water the reference pressure (formula_3) may be entered as 10333 mm formula_14.

At higher altitudes CAS can be corrected for compressibility error to give equivalent airspeed (EAS). In practice compressibility error is negligible below about and .

<text>Faifley (, IPA:[ˈfjuːn̴̪ˈvɛɫ̪əx]) is a large estate forming part of the town of Clydebank, Scotland, adjoining the former village of Hardgate, with a population of approximately 5,001. Along with Duntocher and Hardgate, Faifley falls within West Dunbartonshire&#x27;s &quot;Kilpatrick&quot; ward with a combined population of 12,719 in 2011.

Faifley has in past undergone many changes with many of the older housing removed, re-built or renovated. Faifley has two schools each with a corresponding church; Edinbarnet Primary (Non-Denominational) with the White Church and St Joseph&#x27;s Primary(Roman Catholic) with St Joseph&#x27;s church.

At the heart of the community until now, was &quot;Boabs&quot;, a superstore conglomerate. The community centre also contained the Faifley Branch Library until it was closed in March 2011 by West Dunbartonshire Council. Faifley Library reopened on 6 December 2013 after a decision by West Dunbartonshire Council earlier that year. The Faifley Library is located at the rear of Edinbarnet Campus, off Craigpark Street, G81 5BS.

==History==
===Early history===
In the transfers of land from the ownership from the Earls of Lennox to the Monks of Paisley Abbey in 1227 the area now called Faifley, was called Fimbalach, possibly meaning &quot;The White Pass&quot;. In 1587 it becomes Ferchlay and by 1594, Fachla.

The name originally referred to the area around Cochno Road, north of Hardgate and between the West (or Loch Humphrey) Burn and East (or Cochno) Burn. These two burns unite at the Hardgate Mill to become the Duntocher Burn. Evidence of man&#x27;s prehistoric settlement in the area was found at Auchnacraig in 1887 when the Reverend James Harvey discovered the Druid (or Cochno) Stone. This sandstone rock, some in diameter, has notable &quot;cup and ring&quot; carvings. Smaller rocks with cup and ring marks are still visible in that area. Another prehistoric relic, the remains of the Cairnhowat burial cairn, can be seen north of the Cochno and Jaw Lochs.

The most valuable lands near Faifley were the estates of Cochno, Edinbarnet and Law. Prior to the Reformation they were, like many Kilpatrick properties, transferred from the ownership of Paisley Abbey to the Hamilton family. Andrew Hamilton, Governor of Dumbarton Castle and Provost of Glasgow, acquired Cochno in 1550 but lost it after siding with Mary, Queen of Scots at the Battle of Langside in 1568. By 1592 the Crown had restored the estates to Claud Hamilton of Cochno. The present house was built in 1757 with additions in 1842. The Hamiltons owned Cochno until 1900 when Claud Hamilton Hamilton died. The estate and farm are now managed by the University of Glasgow Veterinary School.

Edinbarnet and Law were acquired by Andrew Stirling from Stephen Spreull in 1569. The Stirling family held Edinbarnet until the estate was sold to Walter Mackenzie, who replaced the 1644 house with a new mansion in 1882. This was damaged by fire a few years later and rebuilt. Sir Robert Mackenzie inherited the estate in 1905. After his death in 1945, the house and most of the estate were sold by his son Neil to local farmer William Laird. In 1988 the house was converted into a nursing home.

===Churches===
Members of the congregation of Old Kilpatrick Parish Church left in 1777 to form a Burgher Secession congregation, which built a new church in 1781 at Kilpatrick Craigs at the foot of Cochno Road. The Burgher Secession congregation split again in 1799, resulting in the formation of the &quot;auld lichts&quot; and &quot;new lichts&quot;, but they reunited some time after 1860 to form the Craigs and Duntocher United Free Church, worshipping at the church built by the &quot;new lichts&quot; at Old Street in Duntocher in 1822.

===Industry===
Faifley&#x27;s first industries were attracted to the area by the opportunity to harness the water-power provided by the Loch Humphrey Burn and the Cochno Burn. A waulk mill (mentioned in charters of 1643) and a dye works were in existence when William Dunn (1760–1849) purchased the Faifley Cotton Spinning Co in 1811. Dunn had four large cotton mills on the burn and introduced the first steam engines at Faifley by 1836, at which time he was employing 1,400 workers. The American Civil War resulted in a collapse of Britain&#x27;s cotton trade with the US in the 1860s and led to the closure of all but one of the mills.

Faifley Mill was eventually converted to a furniture factory by Glasgow manufacturer Solomon Levy Abrahams (b. Zajac from Bialystok) (understood to have been the first to introduce mechanisation to furniture making in Scotland)and became known as the &quot;Jew&#x27;s Mill&quot;. The tenement on Cochno Road at the &quot;Conkrey Dam&quot; was called Abrahams&#x27; Land, or &quot;The Jew&#x27;s Laun&#x27;&quot;. The manufacture of furniture was continued by J K Arthur &amp; Co, managed by a Mr Strump. After the Second World War, the premises were occupied by Dairyority, a small company making and repairing dairy and refrigeration equipment. The last owners were the bakers MacKechnie&#x27;s Rolls, employing 150 people until the bakery closed in 1991 and the old mill buildings were demolished to make way for housing.

Other small industries existed in Faifley. James Marr&#x27;s Faifley Spade Forge survived on the West Burn until the 1880s. This may have been a remnant of the Dalnotter Iron Works founded a century before at Milton Mill. The mill lade can be seen behind Hillcrest Avenue. There was also a pottery and another forge on the Cochno Burn.

===Housing===

The Clydebank Extension Act of 1949 permitted the annexation of the Faifley area and Clydebank Town Council began work on a new housing scheme in 1953, at Auchinleck Farm to the east of the village. The Jamiesons moved their dairy herd to Dumfries and the farmhouse became part of the Doublet public house in 1963. The Council also began constructing houses nearer to Hardgate and the Scottish Special Housing Association built high-density flats and terraces on the higher ground. Many four-story properties were built using new techniques with poured concrete and eventually the housing scheme had a population of more than 9,000 people. By the time Faifley Primary School was built, there were three pupils for every seat.
Edinbarnet Junior Secondary and Primary schools were built to the north of the scheme and the Roman Catholic school, St Joseph&#x27;s Primary, built on Faifley Road. The Church of Scotland closed the Duntocher East Church in Hardgate in 1956, having built a replacement (&quot;The White Church&quot;) on Faifley Road. A Community / Leisure centre (since demolished) was built in 1970 with aid from a German organisation as a gesture of friendship and reconciliation after the Clydebank Blitz.

===Recent Times===
In 1958, a deputation from the Faifley Tenants&#x27; Association lobbied the Scottish Office in Edinburgh complaining of the poor housing conditions and disparity in rents between Council and SSHA houses. The area suffered from poor amenities, remoteness and high unemployment. A {Kilpatrick Ward} Faifley-Hardgate-Duntocher Initiative was set up to try to resolve some of the problems. Much of the housing stock had developed faults due to poor construction methods and there have been many repair and renewal programmes. Many SSHA houses have been replaced by lower-density housing, reducing the population to about 4,000. The fall in population resulted in the closure of Faifley Primary, which in 2004 became a Library and Community Centre.

<doc id="1129450" wikidata="Q174392" url="?curid=1129450" title="Das Liebesverbot">
<text>(&quot;The Ban on Love&quot;, WWV 38), is an early comic opera in two acts by Richard Wagner, with the libretto written by the composer after Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. Described as a &quot;&quot;, it was composed in early 1836.

Restrained sexuality versus eroticism plays an important role in &#x27;; these themes recur throughout much of Wagner&#x27;s output, most notably in &quot;[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]&quot;, &quot;[[Die Walküre]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Tristan und Isolde]]&quot;. In each opera, the self-abandonment to love brings the lovers into mortal combat with the surrounding social order. In&#x27;, because it is a comedy, the outcome is a happy one: unrestrained sexuality wins as the carnival of the entire population goes rioting on after curtain-fall.

&quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; was Wagner&#x27;s second opera and his first to be performed, when the budding composer was just 22 years of age. It has many signs of an early work, carrying a style modeled closely on contemporary French and Italian comic opera. It is also referred to as the forgotten comedy, being one of Wagner&#x27;s only two comic works, the other being the better-known &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

==Performance history==
Wagner conducted the premiere in 1836 at the Stadttheater Magdeburg. Poorly attended and with a lead singer who forgot the words and had to improvise, it was a resounding flop and its second performance had to be cancelled after a between the prima donna&#x27;s husband and the lead tenor broke out backstage before the curtain had even risen; only three people were in the audience. It was never performed again in Wagner&#x27;s lifetime.

The opera was rarely performed over the following hundred years.

On 16 February 1965, in the United Kingdom, the first performance was given at University College, London, in a semi-professional production staged by the UCLU Music Society in the old Gymnasium.

In 1983, in North America, a successful revival was given, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.

In 1990, a staged production (with reduced orchestra) was mounted in San Francisco by Pocket Opera, led by, and with an English performing translation by, Donald Pippin.

In 1994, &quot;&quot; was performed at the Wexford Opera Festival, in Ireland.

On 19 July 2008, a fully staged production was premiered, by Glimmerglass Opera, in a production by Nicholas Muni, at the Glimmerglass Festival in Cooperstown, New York, USA. The cast was led by Mark Schnaible as Friedrich and Claudia Waite as Isabella; Corrado Rovaris conducted.

In 2009, a concert production was presented at the International Festival of Young Singers at the Kammeroper Schloss Rheinsberg plus a staged production at the Staatstheater Braunschweig in October.

Since 2011, a production of this work has formed part of the repertoire of Helikon Opera Moscow.

In 2013, 200 years after the composer&#x27;s birth, it was performed in Bayreuth for the first time. A production of the Oper Leipzig was shown in the Oberfrankenhalle, a hall for sports, because Wagner had banned his early operas from the Festspielhaus. It was staged by Aron Stiehl with elements of operetta and revue; Constantin Trinks conducted the Gewandhausorchester.

On 24 September 2015, the opera premiered in Romania at the Cluj-Napoca Hungarian Opera.

In 2016, the opera was staged by the Teatro Real, Madrid.

The synopsis is Wagner&#x27;s own description of his scenario, in a translation by William Ashton Ellis published in 1898.

:Place: Palermo
:Time: 16th century

===Act 1===
====The town square====

An unnamed King of Sicily leaves his country on a journey to Naples, as I suppose, and deputes to his appointed State-holder—called simply Friedrich, to mark him for a German—the full authority to use all royal powers in an attempt to radically reform the manners of his capital, which had become an abomination to the strait-laced minister. At the commencement of the piece we see public officers hard at work on the houses of amusement in a suburb of Palermo, closing some, demolishing others, and taking their hosts and servants into custody. The populace interferes; great riot: after a roll of the drums the chief constable Brighella (basso buffo), standing at bay, reads out the edict of the State-holder according to which these measures have been adopted to secure a better state of morals.

General derision, with a mocking chorus; Luzio, a young nobleman and jovial rake (tenor), appears to wish to make himself the people&#x27;s leader; he promptly finds occasion for espousing the cause of the oppressed when he sees his friend Claudio (likewise tenor) conducted on the road to prison, and learns from him that, in pursuance of an ancient law unearthed by Friedrich, he is about to be condemned to death for an amorous indiscretion. His affianced, whom the hostility of her parents has prevented his marrying, has become a mother by him; the hatred of the relatives allies itself with Friedrich&#x27;s puritanic zeal: he fears the worst, and has one only hope of rescue, that the pleading of his sister Isabella may succeed in softening the tyrant&#x27;s heart. Luzio promises to go at once to Isabella in the cloister of the Elisabethans, where she has lately entered her novitiate.

====A convent====

Within the quiet cloister walls we make the acquaintance of this sister, in confidential converse with her friend Marianne, who also has entered as novice. Marianne discloses to her friend, from whom she has long been parted, the sad fate that has brought her hither. By a man of high position she had been persuaded to a secret union, under the pledge of eternal fidelity; in her hour of utmost need she had found herself abandoned, and even persecuted, for the betrayer proved to be the most powerful personage in all the state, no less a man than the King&#x27;s present State-holder.

Isabella&#x27;s horror finds vent in a tempest of wrath, only to be allayed by the resolve to leave a world where such monstrosities can go unpunished.—When Luzio brings her tidings of the fate of her own brother, her abhorrence of his misdemeanour passes swiftly to revolt against the baseness of the hypocritical State-holder who dares so cruelly to tax her brother&#x27;s infinitely lesser fault, at least attainted with no treachery. Her violence unwittingly exhibits her to Luzio in the most seductive light; fired by sudden love, he implores her to leave the nunnery for ever and take his hand. She quickly brings him to his senses, yet decides, without a moment&#x27;s wavering, to accept his escort to the State-holder in the House of Justice.

====A courtroom====

Here the trial is about to take place, and I introduce it with a burlesque examination of various moral delinquents by the chief constable Brighella. This gives more prominence to the seriousness of the situation when the gloomy figure of Friedrich appears, commanding silence to the uproarious rabble that has forced the doors; he then begins the hearing of Claudio in strictest form. The relentless judge is upon the point of passing sentence, when Isabella arrives and demands a private audience of the State-holder.

She comports herself with noble moderation in this private colloquy with a man she fears and yet despises, commencing with nothing but an appeal to his clemency and mercy. His objections make her more impassioned: she sets her brother&#x27;s misdemeanour in a touching light, and pleads forgiveness for a fault so human and in nowise past all pardon. As she observes the impression of her warmth, with ever-greater fire she goes on to address the hidden feeling of the judge&#x27;s heart, which cannot possibly have been quite barred against the sentiments that made her brother stray, and to whose own experience she now appeals for help in her despairing plea for mercy. The ice of that heart is broken: Friedrich, stirred to his depths by Isabella&#x27;s beauty, no longer feels himself his master; he promises to Isabella whatever she may ask, at price of her own body.

Hardly has she become conscious of this unexpected effect, than, in utmost fury at such incredible villainy, she rushes to door and window and calls the people in, to unmask the hypocrite to all the world. Already the whole crowd is pouring in to the judgment hall, when Friedrich&#x27;s desperate self-command succeeds in convincing Isabella, by a few well-chosen phrases, of the impossibility of her attempt: he would simply deny her accusation, represent his offer as a means of detection, and certainly find credence if it came to any question of repudiating a charge of wanton insult.

Isabella, ashamed and bewildered, recognises the madness of her thought, and succumbs to mute despair. But while Friedrich is displaying his utmost rigour afresh to the people, and delivering sentence on the prisoner, Isabella suddenly remembers the mournful fate of Marianne; like a lightning flash, she conceives the idea of gaining by stratagem what seems impossible through open force. At once she bounds from deepest sorrow to the height of mirth: to her lamenting brother, his downcast friend, the helpless throng, she turns with promise of the gayest escapade she will prepare for all of them, for the very Carnival which the State-holder had so strenuously forbidden shall be celebrated this time with unwonted spirit, as that dread rigorist had merely donned the garb of harshness the more agreeably to surprise the town by his hearty share in all the sport he had proscribed.

Everyone deems her crazy, and Friedrich chides her most severely for such inexplicable folly: a few words from her suffice to set his own brain reeling; for beneath her breath she promises fulfilment of his fondest wishes, engaging to despatch a messenger with welcome tidings for the following night.

Thus ends the first act, in wildest commotion.

===Act 2===
====A prison====

What the heroine&#x27;s hasty plan may be, we learn at the beginning of the second, where she gains admittance to her brother&#x27;s gaol to prove if he is worth the saving. She reveals to him Friedrich&#x27;s shameful proposals, and asks him if he craves his forfeit life at this price of his sister&#x27;s dishonour? Claudio&#x27;s wrath and readiness to sacrifice himself are followed by a softer mood, when he begins to bid his sister farewell for this life, and commit to her the tenderest greetings for his grieving lover; at last his sorrow causes him to quite break down.

Isabella, about to tell him of his rescue, now pauses in dismay; for she sees her brother falling from the height of nobleness to weak avowal of unshaken love of life, to the shamefaced question whether the price of his deliverance be quite beyond her. Aghast, she rises to her feet, thrusts the craven from her, and informs him that he now must add to the shame of death the full weight of her contempt.

As soon as she has returned him to the gaoler, her bearing once more passes to ebullient glee: she resolves indeed to chastise the weak-kneed by prolonging his uncertainty about his fate, but still abides by her decision to rid the world of the most disgraceful hypocrite that ever sought to frame its laws.

She has arranged for Marianne to take her place in the rendezvous desired by Friedrich for the night, and now sends him the invitation, which, to involve him in the greater ruin, appoints a masked encounter at one of the places of amusement which he himself has closed.

The madcap Luzio, whom she also means to punish for his impudent proposal to a novice, she tells of Friedrich&#x27;s passion, and remarks on her feigned decision to yield to the inevitable in such a flippant fashion that she plunges him, at other times so feather-brained, into an agony of despair: he swears that even should the noble maid intend to bear this untold shame, he will ward it off with all his might, though all Palermo leap ablaze.

====Outside Friedrich&#x27;s Palace====

In effect he induces every friend and acquaintance to assemble at the entrance to the Corso that evening, as if for leading off the prohibited grand Carnival procession. At nightfall, when the fun is already waxing wild there, Luzio arrives, and stirs the crowd to open bloodshed by a daring carnival song with the refrain: &quot;Who&#x27;ll not carouse at our behest, your steel shall smite him in the breast.&quot; Brighella approaching with a company of the watch, to disperse the motley gathering, the revellers are about to put their murderous projects into execution; but Luzio bids them scatter for the present, and ambush in the neighbourhood, as he here must first await the actual leader of their movement: for this is the place that Isabella had tauntingly divulged to him as her rendezvous with the State-holder.

For the latter Luzio lies in wait: he soon detects him in a stealthy masker, whose path he bars, and as Friedrich tears himself away he is about to follow him with shouts and drawn rapier, when by direction of Isabella, concealed among the bushes, he himself is stopped and led astray. Isabella comes forth, rejoicing in the thought of having restored Marianne to her faithless mate at this very moment, and in the possession of what she believes to be the stipulated patent of her brother&#x27;s pardon; she is on the point of renouncing all further revenge when, breaking open the seal by the light of a torch, she is horrified at discovering an aggravation of the order of execution, which chance and bribery of the gaoler had delivered into her hands through her wish to defer her brother&#x27;s knowledge of his ransom.

After a hard battle with the devouring flames of love, and recognising his powerlessness against this enemy of his peace, Friedrich has resolved that, however criminal his fall, it yet shall be as a man of honour. One hour on Isabella&#x27;s bosom, and then his death—by the selfsame law to whose severity the life of Claudio still shall stand irrevocably forfeit. Isabella, who perceives in this action but an additional villainy of the hypocrite, once more bursts out in frenzy of despairing grief.

At her call to instant revolt against the odious tyrant the whole populace assembles, in wildest turmoil: Luzio, arriving on the scene at this juncture, sardonically adjures the throng to pay no heed to the ravings of a woman who, as she has deceived himself, assuredly will dupe them all; for he still believes in her shameless dishonour.

Fresh confusion, climax of Isabella&#x27;s despair: suddenly from the back is heard Brighella&#x27;s burlesque cry for help; himself entangled in the coils of jealousy, he has seized the disguised State-holder by mistake, and thus leads to the latter&#x27;s discovery. Friedrich is unmasked; Marianne, clinging to his side, is recognised. Amazement, indignation, joy: the necessary explanations are soon got through; Friedrich moodily asks to be led before the judgment-seat of the King on his return, to receive the capital sentence; Claudio, set free from prison by the jubilant mob, instructs him that death is not always the penalty for a love-offence.

Fresh messengers announce the unexpected arrival of the King in the harbour; everyone decides to go in full carnival-attire to greet the beloved prince, who surely will be pleased to see how ill the sour puritanism of the Germans becomes the heat of Sicily. The word goes round: &#x27;Gay festivals delight him more than all your gloomy edicts.&#x27; Friedrich, with his newly married wife Marianne, has to head the procession; the Novice, lost to the cloister for ever, makes the second pair with Luzio.

<text>Joshua Ryan Freese (born December 25, 1972) is an American drummer. A member of punk rock band the Vandals since 1989, Freese has also been a member of new wave band Devo since 1996 and rock band Foo Fighters since 2023.

A prolific session and touring drummer, Freese has appeared on over 400 albums since 1986 and performed live with artists including Nine Inch Nails, Weezer, Sublime with Rome, Sting, 100 gecs, the Offspring and Danny Elfman. His considerable workload has earned him &quot;the pristine reputation as one of the most in-demand session drummers in the business,&quot; according to &quot;Variety&quot;, while Freese jokingly dubbed himself &quot;the blue collar freelance drummer to the stars.&quot;

He was previously a member of hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses from 1997 to 1999 and a member of alternative rock band A Perfect Circle from 1999 to 2012, the latter of which he rejoined in 2024.

== Early life ==
Joshua Ryan Freese was born on December 25, 1972, at Florida Hospital in Orlando, Florida. At the time of his birth, Freese&#x27;s father, Stan Freese, was working at the newly-opened Walt Disney World Resort as the director of bands and leader of the Walt Disney World Marching Band. His mother, Patricia (née Weatherhead, later Bridenstine), is a classical pianist and a writer.

In 1974, Freese&#x27;s father was transferred to Disneyland Park in Southern California to lead the Disneyland Band. Freese and his younger brother Jason spent summers at the park while their father worked. Freese said that some of his earliest memories are of he and his brother marching with the Disneyland Band holding toy instruments.

Freese&#x27;s first job was at Disneyland as a shoe shine boy during the summer of 1985. Freese and his brother would shine the shoes of park employees and worked for tips.

== Career ==
Freese began playing the drums when he was eight years old. His father set up a Yamaha drum set he had received through a promotional deal. After playing around on that drum set for two years, Freese&#x27;s father took him to the 1983 NAMM Show, an annual music industry trade show at the Anaheim Convention Center. There he attracted the attention of the crowd by playing on a vendor&#x27;s sample drum set.

Freese returned to the NAMM Show in 1985, where a representative from Simmons found the 12-year-old Freese playing a sample drum set and signed him to an endorsement deal. Freese played a Simmons electronic drum set at PASIC (the Percussive Arts Society International Convention) and in television commercials for Simmons.

=== Disneyland ===
By 1985, Freese&#x27;s father had transitioned out of his bandleader role and into talent booking at Disneyland. That summer, Freese&#x27;s father hired Polo, a Top 40 cover band composed of teenagers around Freese&#x27;s age, which had just won the &quot;Junior Star Search&quot; competition on television. Freese became friends with the band&#x27;s drummer, Jimmy Keegan, and was invited to sit in on a few songs during their sets at the Tomorrowland Terrace stage. The guest spots went so well that Freese was invited to join the band as an additional drummer. Freese played with Polo at Disneyland and other venues from 1985 to 1988.

=== The Zappas ===
In 1988, Freese met and befriended Ahmet Zappa, son of musician Frank Zappa, at a shoot for the TV movie &quot;14 Going on 30&quot;. Zappa got Freese together with Zappa&#x27;s brother Dweezil and the two began playing together casually. Dweezil then asked Freese to record with him, and Freese dropped out of high school to pursue recording full-time (Freese eventually received his GED years later). Not being old enough to drive, Freese&#x27;s father drove him to the recording session in Los Angeles before Freese began staying with the Zappas during the week and going home to Orange County on the weekends. Freese&#x27;s first recorded collaboration with Dweezil was the 1991 album &quot;Confessions&quot;.

=== The Vandals ===
While he was playing at Disneyland with Polo, Freese caught the eye of Dave Quackenbush and Joe Escalante, two members of the punk rock band the Vandals. In 1989, they hired Freese to be the band&#x27;s drummer. Freese has played on all the band&#x27;s albums since except 2000&#x27;s &quot;Look What I Almost Stepped In...&quot;, on which Suicidal Tendencies drummer Brooks Wackerman was deputized due to Freese&#x27;s commitments with A Perfect Circle.

=== Devo ===

In 1996, Freese joined a reformed Devo for a show at the Sundance Film Festival, replacing David Kendrick. Freese has become their primary drummer in concert and in the studio since. Freese has said that he learned to play drums thanks to Devo&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;. Freese played drums on Devo&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Something for Everybody&quot;, and provided backing vocals on Devo&#x27;s holiday single &quot;Merry Something to You&quot;.

=== Guns N&#x27; Roses ===
Freese was a member of hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses from 1997 to 1999, replacing Matt Sorum and signing a two-year contract. Initially hesitant about joining the band, he was persuaded by his friend and collaborator Paul Westerberg of the Replacements, who told Freese, &quot;You should do it. Go do it. It sounds totally wrong; go do it. What are you going to do, be in some totally cool alternative band? Are you going to join the Foo Fighters or something obvious?&quot; Coincidentally, Freese would subsequently go on to join an alternative band, A Perfect Circle, and later joined Foo Fighters.

With Guns N&#x27; Roses, Freese recorded the song &quot;Oh My God&quot; for the &quot;End of Days&quot; soundtrack and co-wrote the song &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; with Axl Rose. Freese drummed on 30 tracks to potentially be included on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, but his recordings were scrapped and re-recorded note-for-note by Bryan Mantia. He was credited with arrangements on four tracks on the album, released in 2008.

=== A Perfect Circle ===
Freese left Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1999 to join A Perfect Circle alongside Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan and the band&#x27;s founder Billy Howerdel. Freese said he chose to make the switch &quot;because it seemed like a more tangible thing that was really going to happen. These guys aren&#x27;t spending a million in the studio. They seem like they want to start a regular band. They want to write and record a record and go on tour six weeks from now. It all seemed very realistic.&quot;

A Perfect Circle&#x27;s first album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, was the highest charting debut for a rock group at number four on the Billboard 200 in its first week of sales. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great record, and I feel proud of it,&quot; Freese said, retrospectively, in 2020. &quot;I always feel okay patting myself on the back for certain projects because there&#x27;s tons of projects I played on that I don&#x27;t like.&quot;

The band&#x27;s follow up release, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, charted at number two in its opening week with over 233,000 copies sold. Freese ultimately played drums on the band&#x27;s first three albums before leaving in 2012. Freese also played drums on two solo albums by Howerdel, one released under the moniker Ashes Divide in 2008 and the other under Howerdel&#x27;s name in 2022. In March 2024, Freese confirmed he would be touring with A Perfect Circle in April for the first time in 13 years.

=== Foo Fighters ===

Freese appeared as one of several guest drummers for the Foo Fighters during a pair of concerts held in tribute to the band&#x27;s late drummer Taylor Hawkins in London and Los Angeles in September 2022. In May 2023, the Foo Fighters introduced Freese as their full-time drummer during a streaming event titled &quot;Preparing Music For Concerts&quot;.

=== Session and touring work ===
Throughout his career, Freese has performed as a session drummer on hundreds of recordings for dozens of artists, joking that his client list of popular musicians made him &quot;the blue collar freelance drummer to the stars.&quot;

Among his early studio recordings as a session musician, Freese played on the Infectious Grooves album &quot;Sarsippius&#x27; Ark&quot; and the Suicidal Tendencies album &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot; in 1992, as well as two albums by the Korean group Seo Taiji and Boys&#x27; in 1994 and 1995. He also played some shows in early 1998 with the band 311 as a fill-in drummer for them on the Warped tour in Australia, Japan and Hawaii. Chad Sexton, 311&#x27;s drummer had broken a hand just before a show in Australia early in the tour. Freese was already on the tour playing with the Vandals every day and played with both bands for the majority of the tour. In 1999, Freese drummed on Mike Ness&#x27; first solo album Cheating At Solitaire.

Among the notable albums Freese performed on in the 2000s are &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; by Good Charlotte, &quot;Fallen&quot; by Evanescence, &quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne, &quot;Thankful&quot; by Kelly Clarkson, &quot;Quebec&quot; by Ween, &quot;Next Level&quot; by Ayumi Hamasaki, and &quot;Crazy Love&quot; by Michael Bublé.

Freese&#x27;s career as a session drummer has featured multiple enduring collaborations. He played on the Offspring&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Splinter&quot; after the departure of Ron Welty, played on several of the band&#x27;s subsequent releases, and served as their touring drummer from 2021 to 2023 after they fired Pete Parada for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccination.

Producer Bob Rock has worked frequently with Freese, and requested that he contribute drum tracks for Lostprophets&#x27; third album, &quot;Liberation Transmission&quot;. Freese has worked on and off with the Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg since 1992, including playing drums with the reunited Replacements from 2013 to 2015. Freese also provided the drums on two Replacements tracks that appear on their greatest-hits album &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know Who I Think I Was&quot;.
Beginning in 2005, Freese served as Sting&#x27;s touring drummer and went on to appear on several of his studio recordings including the album &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot;.

Freese served as Nine Inch Nails&#x27; touring drummer from 2005 to 2008 and performed on the group&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Year Zero&quot; and 2008 album &quot;The Slip&quot;. He left Nine Inch Nails at the end of 2008 in order to spend more time with his family and long-time girlfriend, who was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s third child at the time. &quot;With [Nine Inch Nails frontman] Trent [Reznor], I left on good terms because I was like, &#x27;Listen, man, I don&#x27;t have anything else lined up, I&#x27;m not leaving because this band over here offered me more money,&quot; Freese said. &quot;I need to just go home and be a dad for a while, I need to be home for my family.&#x27; And he was like, &#x27;Yeah, man, that&#x27;s a totally noble, understandable reason.&#x27;&quot;

Freese performed live with Weezer from 2009 to 2011, during which time Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson played guitar, and also played on the band&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Raditude&quot;. In 2011, Freese became the touring drummer for Paramore on the South American leg of their Brand New Eyes World Tour after the band announced the departure of the Farro brothers (Zac and Josh). The next year, Freese toured in 2012 with Sublime with Rome after Bud Gaugh announced his departure from the band.

Notable albums Freese appeared on as a session musician in the 2010s include Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;High Hopes&quot;, Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Stronger&quot;, Rascal Flatts&#x27; &quot;Rewind&quot;, and Lana Del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Norman Fucking Rockwell!&quot; In 2022, he played drums with 100 gecs as well as Danny Elfman at the Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival in Indio, California. Freese also performed in the studio with both artists, on Elfman&#x27;s 2021 release &quot;Big Mess&quot; and 100 gecs&#x27; second album, 2023&#x27;s &quot;10,000 gecs&quot;.

=== Solo work ===
==== Early solo releases ====
In 1998, Freese recorded a number of songs that he wrote and performed himself (including bass, guitar, keyboards and vocals). The result is the lo-fi, 6-song EP &quot;Destroy Earth As Soon As Possible&quot;, released under the name &#x27;Princess&#x27; by T.O.N/Stone Lizard Records.

In 2000, the songs &quot;Caffeine and Vaseline&quot; and &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Chicken&quot; were revived for the 12-song album &quot;The Notorious One Man Orgy&quot;, this time released under Freese&#x27;s own name by Kung Fu Records. Guest appearances include Stone Gossard, Warren Fitzgerald, Michael Ward, Lyle Workman, and Freese&#x27;s brother Jason.

==== &quot;Since 1972&quot; (2009) ====
Freese released his second solo album, &quot;Since 1972&quot;, via his website on March 24, 2009. &quot;Since 1972&quot; was distributed similarly to the value-added packages offered by Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s recent releases. The album was offered as a $7 digital download, and a $15 CD/DVD on his website. As a marketing stunt, the website offers unique incentive packages at prices up to $75,000. Publications covering the offer include SuicideGirls, the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot;, NPR, and Boston Herald.

Of the novelty items for sale, Freese stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not expecting to sell any of those ridiculously priced packages but I sure did get a lot of good press and attention to the fact that I&#x27;m putting out a record because of it! Mission accomplished.&quot;

==== &quot;Just a Minute, Volume 1&quot; (2021) ====
In 2020, after Freese&#x27;s touring work came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he recorded an album of one-minute songs at his home studio titled &quot;Just a Minute, Volume 1&quot;. The album was released in 2021 by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard on his label Loosegroove Records. Taylor Hawkins, who Freese would go on to succeed in Foo Fighters, featured in a promotional video for the song &quot;Heavy Metal Car Collection&quot;, which appeared on the album.

== Personal life ==
Freese lives in Southern California with his wife Nicole and their four children—Hunter, August, Olive, and Lu Lu. He is the older brother of musician Jason Freese, a touring keyboardist and session player for Green Day who has also performed with the Goo Goo Dolls, Dr. Dre, Jewel, Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair, Foxboro Hot Tubs, Joe Walsh, and Weezer.

== Equipment ==
In a 2007 &quot;Guitar Center&quot; interview, Freese stated:

&quot;My set up never gets that crazy or out of the ordinary I don&#x27;t think. You can pretty much always count on starting off with the basic Ringo 4 piece set up and add from there. With the Vandals that&#x27;s all I use. With Devo add a second rack tom. With NIN keep only 1 rack but have 2 floors and a 3rd floor off to the left of my hi-hat (with NIN the drums are all about 2 inches bigger than I normally would use... 14 rack. 24 kick, 18 and 20-inch floors... 16 off the side of my hihat). With A Perfect Circle 2 racks and 2 floors, 2nd snare off the left of my hihat... more cymbals with APC too. With Sting there are 3 racks but smaller sizes and only 1 floor. Never too many cymbals (except with APC I guess). In the studio my drums are usually something really basic a 4, 5, or 6 piece kit with lots of snare and cymbal choices.&quot;

<text>Basil Thompson (1937–2004) was a ballet dancer, master, and teacher.

He was trained by the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet School, now the Royal Ballet in London, and began his career with the Covent Garden Opera Ballet. He became a soloist with the American Ballet Theatre in New York City in 1960, was a ballet master with the Joffrey Ballet, then became a ballet master and artistic director of the Milwaukee Ballet from 1981 to 2000. During his early career in the USA he was married to Alaine Haubert and they had a son, Edward Thompson, in 1969.

He later married Kitty Carrol. They had two children, Audrey and Colin.

Thompson died November 2, 2004, in Lynchburg, Virginia, of sudden cardiac arrest. He was on sabbatical from teaching at the University of Iowa. He was 67.

&quot;Basil brought joy, vigor and dedication to his work as a ballet master, teacher and coach,&quot; Gerald Arpino, founder and artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, stated after Thompson&#x27;s demise. &quot;He knew the art of ballet thoroughly and lovingly shared it with all of us.&quot;

<doc id="1129467" wikidata="Q4921751" url="?curid=1129467" title="Black Rose (JD Souther album)">
<text>Black Rose is the second album by American singer-songwriter JD Souther, released in 1976. It includes Souther&#x27;s version of &quot;Faithless Love&quot; released by Linda Ronstadt in 1974. Ronstadt would later cover &quot;Simple Man, Simple Dream&quot; and &quot;Silver Blue&quot; from this album.

==Reception==

In his retrospective review for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlmann called it an &quot;excellent album steeped in the Southern California country-rock sound of the &#x27;70s&quot;. In a review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote, &quot;John David Souther’s second solo album benefits from a beautiful, all-star Peter Asher production. More sophisticated than either his first album or the two Souther-Hillman-Furay albums, &quot;Black Rose&quot; underscores Souther’s melodic writing, his strongest point, with some genuinely innovative arrangements by David Campbell, the classically trained musician who scored “Prisoner in Disguise&quot; for Linda Ronstadt. &quot;Silver Blue,&quot; much of which Campbell has scored as a duet for voice and plucked double bass and violas, is a starkly arresting production, while setting &quot;Faithless Love&quot; into a semiformal piece for voice, acoustic guitar and chamber ensemble transforms a prettier-than-average country-rock ballad into an eloquent one. &quot;Doors Swing Open,&quot; a complex tune based on ninth and minor sixth chords, boasts an elegantly lush arrangement that both gives it shape and highlights its lovely chromaticism.&quot;

&quot;Midnight Prowl&quot; was a minor hit in Boston in 1976.

The company was founded in 1959 in the town of Bradford on Avon in the English county of Wiltshire, and moved to its current location in the 1960s. During the 1990&#x27;s the hulls were built in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, initially under license by Galt Composites &amp; later as part of Avon Inflatables.

Until 1994, Avon Inflatables formed part of Avon Rubber, but the business was then sold and now operates independently of its former parent. Since 1998, the company has been a division of Zodiac Marine of France.

In 2019, Avon launched an electric jet-drive tender. The dinghy is powered by a battery from the BMW i3 car and was developed in partnership with Torqeedo, owned by Deutz AG.
