<text>Frente! (or Frente) is an Australian folk-pop and indie pop group which originally formed in 1989. The original line-up consisted of Simon Austin on guitar and backing vocals, Angie Hart on lead vocals, Tim O&#x27;Connor on bass guitar (later replaced by Bill McDonald), and Mark Picton on drums (later replaced by Alastair Barden, then by Peter Luscombe). 

In August 1991, they issued their debut extended play &quot;Whirled&quot;, which included the track, &quot;Labour of Love&quot;. In March 1992, they released a second EP, &quot;Clunk&quot;, with its featured track &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot;, peaking at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was followed in October by &quot;Kelly Street&quot; (the unintentional misprint of &quot;Accidentally Kelly Street&quot; was retained) which reached No. 4. Their debut album, &quot;Marvin the Album&quot;, issued in November, peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. &quot;Labour of Love&quot; was released as an EP outside of Australasia in 1994 as a CD single with a cover version of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; included. 

The band split up in 1998, but have reunited three times to date – most recently in 2014. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane wrote that the group&#x27;s &quot;quirky, irreverent, acoustic-based sound was at odds with the usual guitar-heavy, grunge trends of the day. The band&#x27;s presentation had a tweeness about it that could have been off-putting if not for its genuine freshness and honesty&quot;.

==History==
Frente! were formed in Melbourne, as &quot;Frente&quot; in 1989 by Simon Austin on guitar and backing vocals, Angie Hart on lead vocals, Tim O&#x27;Connor on bass guitar and Mark Picton on drums and recorder. The group were named after the Spanish word for &#x27;forehead&#x27; and &#x27;front&#x27;, according to &quot;Inpress&quot; magazine &quot;[i]t rhymes with &#x27;heaven-sent-eh!&#x27;&quot;. The band spent two years performing in Melbourne&#x27;s inner-city venues before, in August 1991, issuing their self-funded debut extended play, &quot;Whirled&quot;, on the Thumb Print label. It was produced and engineered by Owen Bolwell at Whirled Records in Richmond. Hart explained that the exclamation mark was added for the CD&#x27;s cover art &quot; don&#x27;t write our name like that, but we thought we would on the CD covers because it looks good&quot;. One of &quot;Whirled&quot;″s eight tracks, &quot;Labour of Love&quot;, was voted by Triple J listeners to No. 69 on their Hottest 100 for 1991. &quot;Labour of Love&quot; was co-written by Austin and Hart.

Frente! signed with Mushroom Records&#x27;s White Label which issued their second EP, &quot;Clunk&quot;, in March 1992. It featured the track, &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot;, and peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was certified gold by ARIA for shipment of 35,000 copies. In October 1992, they released a single, &quot;Kelly Street&quot; (sic), which reached No. 4 and was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units. McFarlane described it as a &quot;summery sugar-pop&quot; tune with a &quot;breezy, slightly kooky video clip&quot;. O&#x27;Connor had written the track after moving to Kenny Street but incorrectly told his friends he was going to Kelly Street; the record label misspelt the first word but the group decided to keep the error and its lower case. Initially Hart was positive about the track, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s a really happy song for me. It&#x27;s about making all the right decisions and feeling really confident about what you&#x27;re doing&quot;. Hart changed her mind after it was parodied on TV&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; as &quot;Accidentally Was Released&quot; – in 2005 she reiterated, &quot;I still hate it&quot;.

On 24 November 1992, their debut album, &quot;Marvin the Album&quot;, was released, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was produced by Daniel Denholm (Club Hoy), Michael Koppelman (Prince) and the band. The album was certified platinum in Australia. On the ARIA End of Year Charts for 1992 &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot; was placed at No. 20 and &quot; Kelly Street&quot; was placed at No. 29. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 the group won &#x27;Breakthrough Artist – Album&#x27; for &quot;Marvin the Album&quot; and &#x27;Breakthrough Artist – Single&#x27; for &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot;. The album was also nominated for &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; (by Hart and Louise Beach) and &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Best Video&#x27; (directed by Robbie Douglas-Turner). Another single, &quot;No Time&quot;, was released in February 1993, and peaked at No. 50 in March. In July that year, Hart appeared nude for a cover story in &quot;Juice&quot;, with carefully positioned beads and her hand. By that time Alastair Barden (ex-King Idiot, Maelstrom) had replaced Picton on drums.

In 1994, Frente! toured Europe and the US to promote the international version of &quot;Marvin the Album&quot; on Mammoth Records. AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson felt that &quot;after several listens, one starts to realize just how strong this abstract pop-folk-rock release is&quot;. Mammoth had also issued a seven-track extended play, &quot;Labour of Love&quot;. This included their acoustic cover version of New Order&#x27;s 1986 hit, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, which reached No. 76 in the UK – following releases of earlier tracks: &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot; which did not chart, and &quot; Kelly Street&quot; which reached No. 80. &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; appeared in Australia on a re-issued version of &quot;Lonely&quot; EP in May 1994 which peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Singles Chart – the first issue had charted at No. 88 in February. In the US, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; peaked at No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The US re-release of &quot;Labour of Love&quot; managed No. 9 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Ordinary Angels&quot; appeared on the 1994 soundtrack for the US TV series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. By year&#x27;s end, due to constant touring, O&#x27;Connor left and was replaced on bass guitar by Bill McDonald (ex-Hot Half Hour, Deborah Conway Band, Rebecca&#x27;s Empire).

In early 1995, Hart recorded vocals for an Australian single, &quot;Tingly&quot;, by Pop! released in November, which reached No. 92. Frente! has a track on a compilation album, &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot; (5 December 1995), a cover version of &quot;Open Up Your Heart (and Let the Sunshine In)&quot;. During 1995, Frente! recorded their second album, &quot;Shape&quot;, in Spain with Ted Niceley (Fugazi), David M. Allen (The Cure, Sisters of Mercy), Cameron McVey aka Booga Bear (Neneh Cherry) and the band producing. The first single, &quot;Sit on My Hands&quot;, peaked at No. 66 in Australia in July 1996. The second single, &quot;What&#x27;s Come Over Me&quot; peaked at No. 116 in Australia, and No. 77 in the UK. The album was issued in July 1996, peaking at No. 35 on the ARIA Albums Chart. McFarlane felt it was &quot;more sophisticated and textured than its naive (yet still classy) predecessor&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the group &quot;experiment with trancy instrumental overtones and languid trip-hop beats ... Certain melodic lines slip out of the pleasant mist while the album is playing, but nothing is memorable after the record is finished&quot;.

During 1996, the group toured Europe, Asia and US for three months to promote the album. They used Fraser Brindley on keyboards while touring. John Everson of &quot;Illinois Entertainer&quot;, interviewed Hart in September and described Austin as her &quot;on-again, off-again boyfriend&quot;, Hart detailed &quot;Simon and I had a lot of shit to work out. We went out for a while and then we broke up and then we went on tour. It goes in and out of being fine.&quot; In Canada in August, and then Australia during December, they supported Alanis Morissette on her tour, promoting &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. Morissette&#x27;s guitarist, Jesse Tobias, became Hart&#x27;s boyfriend. In January 1997, Frente! performed on the Melbourne leg of the Big Day Out, in July that year they issued another CD single, &quot;Goodbye Goodguy&quot;. Tobias had joined Frente! for their final tour before the band broke up late in 1997 – Hart and Tobias married and formed a duo, Splendid.

===Post break-up appearances===
In late 2003, Frente! founders Austin and Hart, who were both living in the US, resumed song writing together. One of their new compositions, &quot;Sleeping&quot;, appeared on Splendid&#x27;s EP, &quot;States of Awake&quot; (2004). During late 2004, Austin and Hart reformed Frente! for acoustic shows in both New York and Los Angeles. In January 2005, Frente! performed some Australian east coast dates, the line-up of Austin, Hart, and McDonald were joined by Pete Luscombe on drums. The group issued a three-track EP, &quot;Try to Think Less&quot;, on Pop Boomerang Records. On 28 November 2010, Frente! played at a Punters Club reunion show at the Corner Hotel, curated by Hart. The show also featured other early 1990s Melbourne bands: The Glory Box, The Hollowmen and The Fauves. In 2011, Frente! performed at the Brisbane Festival in the Speigeltent.

In March 2014, it was announced that Austin and Hart will tour as Frente!, performing nine concerts around Australia during May and June 2014 to mark the 21st anniversary of &quot;Marvin the Album&quot;. A special two CD anniversary edition of the album was also released on 16 May.

In March 2023, Frente! performed at MordiFest as part of the leadup to the 30th anniversary of &quot;Marvin the Album&quot;. Hart and Austin were joined by Tamara Murphy on electric bass guitar, Sophie Koh on keyboards and melodica, and Ben Wiesner on drums. The group also performed at the Castlemaine State Festival, at which O&#x27;Connor briefly joined the band on bass for &quot;Accidently Kelly Street&quot;.

Frente! was selected as one of the bands as part of the Mushroom 50 Concert, celebrating 50 years of Mushroom Records with fifty songs for fifty years. Frente! performed Ordinary Angels in front of the live audience at Rod Laver Arena on 26 November 2023.

On 31 August 2024, Frente! performed at the reopened Punters Club.

<text>Martin Lyon Dobkin (born May 8, 1942) is a physician and former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was elected on October 1, 1973, as the first Mayor of the new City of Mississauga, Ontario, and served as Mayor from 1973 to 1976. He was the inaugural mayor of the newly amalgamated City of Mississauga, which had combined the former Towns of Mississauga, Port Credit and Streetsville. He lost re-election just three years later. He was originally trained as a medical doctor and he continued his practice during the time he was mayor. He continues to work as a doctor although a car accident in 2003 reduced his activities.

In honour of his service to the city the Dr. Martin L. Dobkin Community Park, a large 30 acre park in central Mississauga with multiple facilities, was officially opened on June 14, 1992.

In 1955, at the age of 13, he moved to Cobourg, Ontario, with his family. He attended Cobourg and District Collegiate Institute. He graduated from Queen&#x27;s University Medical School in 1966. This was followed by an internship at Montreal General Hospital and then a one-year residency in pediatrics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.

In 1968 he married Michele Bitton and they had 3 children - Edward, Caroline and Alain. Also in 1968 he began his medical practice as a family physician in Mississauga. and became a member of the active staff at the Mississauga Hospital. In 1970 Dobkin was appointed as coroner in the County of Peel.

==Medical career==
In 1968, Dobkin began practising family medicine in Cooksville in the practice of Drs. Ann and J. D. Smith. In 1970, he left this practice and opened up his own office in Applewood Hills. In 1978, he purchased a property at the corner of Hurontario Street and Central Parkway West and, in conjunction with Dr. K. Malicki, founded the City Centre Family Physician Clinic. The clinic soon grew to seven family physicians, the largest family practice clinic in South Mississauga. In 1992, a new comprehensive medical building was constructed on the site and the practice continued there.

Dobkin worked in the emergency department of the Mississauga Hospital on a part-time basis for 20 years. For the first 17 years in practice, he delivered several hundred newborns. He held the position of medical director at the Tyndall Nursing Home from 1976 to 1984. He served on various committees at the Mississauga Hospital and has been a member of the Department of Family Practice since 1968.

==Politics==
On October 1, 1973, as a political novice, he was elected as the first mayor of the newly created City of Mississauga. At 31 years of age, Dobkin became the youngest person in Canada to be elected mayor of a large city. He served a three-year term as mayor of Mississauga.

Dobkin was swept into office as the head of a &quot;reform council&quot; in Mississauga, which included other newcomers such as Mary-Helen Spence, David Culham, Hubert Wolf, Kaye Killaby, and Hazel McCallion.

The term of the first council was very prolific, creative, and productive in its many achievements. The most important of these was the initiation and creation of a new and comprehensive official plan for the new city, which provided the blueprint for the future large-scale development of the city into one of the finest municipalities in Canada.

Numerous properties were purchased to provide the green space and parklands for the new city. These included the acquisitions of the Rattray Marsh, Adamson House, Cawthra Elliott Estate, Jack Darling Park, Morning Dew Park, Cooksville Creek Lands, and the CVCA parkland at the mouth of the Credit River.

Libraries that were built or completed were the Burnhamthorpe, Lorne Park, and the Lakeview branches. As well, the Malton Community Centre and the Mississauga Valley Community Centre were designed and built.

During Dobkin&#x27;s era, Mississauga Transit was significantly enlarged, adding a state-of-the-art transit headquarters on Central Parkway West, Canada&#x27;s first articulated buses, and many other infrastructure projects.

In the 1976 municipal election, Dobkin faced city councillor Ron Searle. Dobkin who was portrayed as the anti-development candidate, was defeated by Searle by about 3,000 votes.

<text>Johann Friedrich Adam, later called Michael Friedrich Adams, and also Johannes Michael Friedrich Adams in full citation of botany discoveries (1780 in Moscow – 1 March 1838, in Vereya) was a botanist from St. Petersburg, Russian Empire.

He studied from 1795–1796 in the medical school of St. Petersburg. In the years 1800–1802 he traveled across Transcaucasia in the entourage of Count Apollo Mussin-Pushkin (1760–1805). In 1805, he was part of a scientific team attached to the unsuccessful diplomatic mission of Count Yury Golovkin to China. After the failure of the mission, he and many of the other scientists stayed on in Siberia to pursue their researches. In 1806, while in Yakutsk, he heard about an intact woolly mammoth carcass near the mouth of the Lena River. He hastily arranged an expedition to the location where he was able to recover most of the skeleton, skin, and almost forty pounds of hair. At the time, and for almost a century after, this was the most complete mammoth known. He returned to St. Petersburg with his prize. The skeleton is now on display at The Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg, where it is known as the Adams mammoth.

Later in his life, he taught as assistant professor for botanics at the Medico-Surgical Academy of Moscow.

<text>Ronald Alfred Searle (July 19, 1919 – August 29, 2015) was an English-born Canadian soldier, publisher, and politician who served as the fourth mayor of Mississauga, Ontario from 1976 to 1978.

==Early life==

Searle was born in Southampton, England to Ruby and Theodore Searle on July 19, 1919. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a purser with the White Star Line and a seaman with the Royal Navy during World War I. The family relocate to Toronto where the family had relatives.

===Military career===
After joining the Toronto Scottish militia in the mid-1930s, Searle later signed up with the Toronto Scottish Regiment immediately upon Canada declaring war against Nazi Germany in September 1939. During World War II Searle landed twice in France, once at Brest and once at Normandy. He was later wounded at Falaise in Ardennes when he took three machine gun bullets to his leg.

===Post-war life and family===
After the war he began a career in magazine publishing. On December 10, 1949, he married his wife, Mollie, and together they raised one son, Mark William Searle. The Searles were married for 50 years until Mollie Searle&#x27;s death in 1999.

==Political career==
Searle first entered politics when he was elected president of the Orchard Heights Homeowners Association in 1959.

In 1962, he was elected to Mississauga town council and served for fourteen years. While on council Searle fiercely debated with sitting mayor Martin Dobkin in both municipal and regional council meetings on many issues, including increased municipal funding for child care and legal aid. Dobkin, who referred to Searle as &quot;the official leader of the opposition&quot;, noted that despite the political opposition the two enjoyed a friendly personal relationship.

Searle was elected mayor in 1976 amid a corruption scandal in the municipal government and a massive real estate boom throughout the city. With increased home prices driving lower-income citizens out of Mississauga, Searle made affordable housing a central issue of his administration and told a reporter for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; shortly after his electoral victory that &quot;[his] concern for [affordable housing] overrides all other concerns.&quot; Throughout his term in office he lobbied for cheaper homes and opposed the federal government&#x27;s cuts to housing grants.

Searle ran for re-election at the end of his term in 1978, but lost to former Streetsville mayor Hazel McCallion with a final tally of 28,005 to 25,029 votes. He later made another unsuccessful bid for the mayoralty in 1982, but was defeated by McCallion again.

While still a councillor, Searle also ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate for the riding of Peel in the 1965 federal election. He finished a distant second to Liberal candidate Bruce Beer.

==Later life and death==
Following his failed 1982 election bid, Searle remained active in the community. He would often represent homeowners&#x27; interests at city hall, and was a frequent participant in veterans&#x27; events and events at the Port Credit Yacht Club.

In 2007 he was highly critical of Tim Peterson&#x27;s installation as the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario candidate for Mississauga South after crossing the floor from the Ontario Liberal Party, remarking that the process was &quot;a violation of the democratic principles the [Progressive] Conservative Party has stood for over the years&quot;.

In late August 2015, Searle was admitted to Mississauga Hospital for pneumonia. He died in hospital on August 29, 2015, at the age of 96. The City of Mississauga set up an official book of condolences at the Mississauga Civic Centre and lowered the flags at all city-owned buildings in his honour from August 29 to September 11, 2015.

==Honours==
The following honours were conferred on Searle:
* Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal
* Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal
* Legion of Honour

<text>Flugan (&quot;The Fly&quot;) was an early aeroplane designed and built by Carl Richard Nyberg outside his home in Lidingö, Sweden. Construction started in 1897 and he kept working on it until 1922. The craft only managed a few short jumps and Nyberg was often ridiculed, however several of his innovations are still in use. He was the first to test his design in a wind tunnel and the first to build a hangar. The reasons for failure include poor wing and propeller design and, allegedly, Nyberg&#x27;s fear of heights.

The Flugan had a wingspan of 5 meters, and the surface area of the wings was 13 m2. It was powered by a steam engine heated by four blowtorches (UK: blowlamps) and it produced 10 hp (7 kW) at 2000 rpm. The power-to-weight ratio was actually better than the Wright engine. The total weight of the plane was 80 kg. The weight of the engine was 18 kg.

<doc id="1144771" wikidata="Q328387" url="?curid=1144771" title="Yokozawa Shōgen">
<text> was a Japanese samurai of the sixteenth century, who served Date Masamune, ruler of the Sendai domain.

In September 1616, under an order by Date Masamune, Yokozawa went to Mexico on the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; in order to fetch his compatriot Hasekura Rokuemon who was coming back from an embassy to Europe.

His trip proved difficult, and around one hundred men on the ship died en route. He arrived in Acapulco in May 1617. He remitted a letter and some merchandise from Date Masamune, and was baptized, receiving the name of Don Alonzo Hacaldo.

The ship sailed in April 1618 for a fourth trans-Pacific travel, and arrived in the Philippines, where she was bought by the local Spanish government in order to &quot;reinforce defenses against Holland forces by all means possible&quot;. Luis Sotelo chose to remain in the Philippines due to the worsening anti-Christian situation in Japan, but Yokozawa Shogen managed to leave for Japan together with Hasekura Rokuemon on a trade ship in August 1620.

After his arrival in Japan, Yokozawa is recorded to have renounced the Christian faith and burnt all his Christian-related belongings.

In 1621 however, Yokozawa Shogen is known to have signed a letter to the Pope together with seventeen other Christians from Northern Japan. His name comes in second place after (後藤寿庵).

Neither the later life of Yokozawa, or his grave&#x27;s location, are known.

<doc id="1144776" wikidata="Q14875340" url="?curid=1144776" title="New Fort York">
<text>New Fort York, later the Stanley Barracks, is a former British and Canadian military base in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located on the Lake Ontario shoreline. It was built in 1840–1841 to replace Toronto&#x27;s original Fort York at the mouth of Garrison Creek as the primary military base for the settlement. Unlike the older fort, many of the new fort buildings were made with limestone instead of wood. A protective wall was planned for the new fort but was never built. The fort was used by the British army until 1870, and the Canadian military subsequently used the fort to train troops for the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. It also trained one of the first regiments of the North-West Mounted Police. The Canadian military stopped using it after World War II and the fort was demolished in the 1950s. Only the Officers&#x27; Quarters building remains on the site.

==History==
===British era===
When the British set up the military defences of York, Upper Canada, a military reservation was created by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe, roughly bordered by today&#x27;s Dufferin Street, Queen Street, Peter Street and the lakeshore. Two 18-pounder guns were placed on the lakeshore just to the east of the future fort site, known as the Western Battery, to protect the approach to the harbour. Guns were also placed on the western shoreline of the Toronto Islands. The Western Battery guns were destroyed in the War of 1812&#x27;s Battle of York in 1813.

As the old Fort York&#x27;s wood buildings aged, it was determined that new accommodations were needed. In addition, private buildings were being rented in the town to accommodate soldiers. To finance the new fort, Lieutenant Governor Colborne approved the sale of some of the military reserve lands in 1833. It was not until after the 1837 rebellion that action was taken to start construction. Approval was given in 1839 by Lieutenant-Governor Bond Head to build a new fort to accommodate 300 soldiers, based on an 1833 plan drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Gustavus Nicolls.

A series of six stone buildings were constructed around 1840 by the Royal Engineers of the British Army with the biggest building being the Officers&#x27; Quarters. The two-storey Queenston limestone structure cost . The fort also included two privates&#x27; barracks (holding 207 and 105 soldiers), a hospital, an officers&#x27; stable, barracks master&#x27;s store, an engine house, gunpowder magazine and a canteen, all organized around a parade square. The original plan included fortifications surrounding the fort but as a cost-saving measure a cedar picket fence to enclose the fort was constructed, with fortifications to be added at some later time. A road was built between the forts, entering the new fort through a wrought-iron gate and passing under an arch in the eastern privates&#x27; barracks.

Although living conditions were considered good for the time, conditions during the winter were considered very cold, and keeping water from freezing was difficult. During the 1850s, the number of British troops at the fort was reduced, having been deployed in the Crimean War. Numbers rose again in the 1860s during the United States Civil War. In the 1860s, the space at the new fort was insufficient and The 13th Hussars were quartered in the nearby Crystal Palace exhibition building.

===Transfer to Canada===
In 1867, three of the British colonies, including the Province of Canada, united to form the new country of Canada. In 1870, the British Army withdrew from the Fort, with the property turned over to the Canadian Militia, the official turnover happening in 1871. The fort became mostly vacant, used only by a few military families for living quarters and the Ontario Rifle Association for training and exhibitions. In 1874, the new North-West Mounted Police used the fort to train a group of recruits for deployment in Manitoba.

In 1883, the Government of Canada established the first permanent force of the military and a new military purpose for the fort was established. After some repairs, the fort reopened in 1884 as an infantry school and base for the Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Company C, later named The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR). The Company would see its first action the following year in the North-West Rebellion.

The rifle ranges of the fort led to incidents with passing boats and pedestrians. Bullets would occasionally hit boats if they strayed too close and two persons were struck by bullets in 1887. The Canadian military purchased land for a new rifle range in 1889 just west of Etobicoke Creek in Toronto Township (Lakeview, Mississauga), just west of Long Branch.

In 1893, The Royal Canadian Dragoons were transferred to the fort. That same year the fort was renamed Stanley Barracks after Lord Stanley of Preston, the retired Governor General of Canada. Lord Stanley is also famous for donating hockey&#x27;s Stanley Cup. In 1894, the Dragoons performed their first Dragoon Musical Ride described as &quot;drill pattern formation riding to music at three and a half paces.&quot; The Musical Ride would be performed for many years by the Dragoons until they became an armoured regiment in 1940. It was a popular feature of the CNE Grandstand show.

Later in the 1890s, troops of the Dragoons and the RCR from the fort helped to police the Yukon Gold Rush. Troops of the Dragoons and RCR also joined British forces fighting in South Africa in the Second Boer War. The better pay offered to soldiers to fight in South Africa also led to desertions. In 1901, 46 men of the Dragoons and RCR deserted.

===Transfer to City of Toronto===
In 1878, the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West was held on the reserve. The next year, the annual Toronto Industrial Exhibition, later to become the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), was held on the site under a lease by the City of Toronto. As the CNE grew in size every year, the City of Toronto sought to take more and more of the Military Reserve. The end of the New Fort and the Military Reserve began in 1903 when the Government of Canada and the City of Toronto entered into an agreement to transfer the lands of the Old Fort, the New Fort and Fort&#x27;s graveyard to City of Toronto ownership. The City promised to preserve the Old Fort and the graveyard and to allow all military activities on the property to continue until replacement facilities were built.

During World War I, fort activities expanded to the CNE buildings, which were used for winter quarters, (summer quarters were at Long Branch) although the CNE continued. The barracks were used as a receiving station for the internment of German, Austro-Hungarian, and Turkish citizens, considered &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. From 1914 until October 1916, up to 90 men at one time were interned in the west privates&#x27; barracks before being transferred to other facilities. Before the war was over, many were pardoned and released upon the signing of pledges of loyalty to the laws of Canada and to report regularly to police stations. Ukrainians, then subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were held in the barracks. In 1998, the Ukrainian community of Toronto erected a plaque at the Officers&#x27; Quarters to memorialize the internment.

In the 1920s, the continued expansion of the CNE meant further encroachment on the Fort grounds. The CNE asked the City of Toronto to give notice for the military to vacate. The new Princes&#x27; Boulevard necessitated the demolition of some of the Barracks&#x27; buildings, including some stables and the riding school. Room for horses was offered in the buildings used for livestock. A compromise was made and new stables were built and the military offered the use of the Coliseum and Livestock arenas.

During World War II, the fort and many of the nearby exhibition buildings were again used by Canadian troops prior to being sent overseas. The Coliseum was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Artillery used the Dominion Government Building, while the Horse Palace housed the 48th Highlanders, Toronto Scottish, Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps and the B Company of the Royal Canadian Regiment. Other buildings used included the General Exhibits Building, the Graphic Arts Building and the Horticultural Building. The dressing room of the Grandstand was used for anti-gas instruction. The annual CNE went on as scheduled with emphasis on the war effort in Canada as well as Britain, in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Several of the buildings used by the military were open to the public during the Ex. The CNE was not held during 1942–1945. The CNE Camp was used as a demobilization centre for returning troops at the end of the war before closing on June 1, 1946.

After World War II, the military withdrew from Stanley Barracks to the military installation at Long Branch. The Royal Canadian Dragoons had already relocated in 1941 to Camp Borden. The CNE announced a plan to demolish the fort and build a new civic auditorium. However, these plans went on hold, as Toronto was experiencing a housing shortage emergency. The Government of Canada contributed 50% of the cost to convert the buildings (there were 31 at the time) for emergency civilian housing. The military retained its detention facility temporarily. Considered to be in extremely poor condition, the housing began closing down in 1950 and was evacuated by 1951. Demolition of the wooden buildings began in 1951 while families were still living in the barracks.

By September 1951, only the four stone buildings remained: the officers&#x27; quarters, the hospital building and the two soldiers&#x27; barracks. Community support developed to preserve the Barracks to operate as a museum. Governor-General Vincent Massey advocated to retain the stone buildings. Three of the last four buildings were demolished in 1953 to provide parking for the CNE. The final building remained in limbo. The CNE Association planned to demolish the building for more parking. In 1957, it was saved from demolition by Toronto City Council on the advice of the Toronto Civic Historical Committee.

The gates to the barracks (gate doors forged in England in 1839) were salvaged in 1957 by the owners of the Guild Inn in Scarborough. The gates were re-erected in Toronto on Kingston Road at Guildwood Parkway, at the entrance to Guildwood Village, where they may still be viewed. Lights replaced the stone globes on the top of the gate posts.

The Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario erected a plaque commemorating the fort on November 11, 1963, near the former Officers&#x27; Quarters. The ceremony was attended by the 29th Field Regiment, the 42nd Medium Regiment and the 1st Artillery Locating Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery, and the Toronto Garrison Artillery Band. Dignitaries included Lt-General G. G. Simmonds, former chief of the General Canadian Staff, Professor J. M. Careless of the Ontario Historical Sites Board, Col. R. S. Timmons, former commander of The Royal Canadian Dragoons and Maj. W. J. Lennox the artillery chaplain. Timmons, commander of the garrison for 5 1/2 years, unveiled the plaque.

In 2004, plans were developed to build a hotel and conference centre on the fort site, north of the Quarters. A letter of intent was signed by the owner of the Windsor Arms Hotel. A required archaeological dig found the foundations of the stone buildings. The City of Toronto decided not to build on the fort site. Instead, the Automotive Building to the east was converted to a conference centre, the hotel was moved to the east of the fort site and the foundations were to be preserved. The new Hotel X Toronto project adjacent to the site has revealed the barracks&#x27; foundations. An entrance pavilion to the hotel is a steel lattice structure that approximates the shape of the enlisted men&#x27;s barracks. Within, the uncovered foundations are visible through a glass floor. The parade ground has become a landscaped plaza.

Regiments from the British Army and the Canadian militia that were garrisoned at the fort include:

* Royal Canadian Rifles
* Seventy-First Highland Light Infantry
* Royal Artillery
* Thirteenth Hussars
* Canadian Permanent Force
* C Company of the School of Infantry, now The Royal Canadian Regiment
* B Squadron, The Royal Canadian Dragoons
==Officers&#x27; Quarters==

The two-storey Officers&#x27; Quarters is designed in the Georgian style with influences of English Palladianism. It rises two storeys, with full basement and attic, on a foundation of Kingston limestone, its thick walls built with Queenston limestone with a surrounding dry moat. Its original roof was covered with slate tiles but was recovered with metal. Its north face was designed to be the front, facing the parade ground. The south face is identical to the north face. The building was organized to give two-thirds to the officers and one-third to the Barracks&#x27; Master.

Since 1955, the Officers&#x27; Quarters building has served as the home for various museums, including Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Marine Museum. From 1955 to 1957, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame and in 1957, the Hockey Hall of Fame shared space at the Quarters. The Officers&#x27; Quarters housed the Marine Museum from 1959 to 1998 until it moved to Harbourfront. The museum has since closed. Vacant since 1998, the Officers&#x27; Quarters was opened for one weekend in May 2006 during Doors Open Toronto.

While the building was home to the Marine Museum, the grounds housed two items from Toronto history. The tugboat Ned Hanlan was on display until 2012 on the west side of the building, before it was moved to Hanlan&#x27;s Point on the Toronto Islands. Canadian National locomotive No. 6213 was located on the east side from 1960 until 2009 when it was moved to Roundhouse Park.

In 1999, Toronto City Council designated the Quarters as a Landmark Heritage Property under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act.&quot; In 2009, City Council approved the development of a hotel on the property, just to the east of the fort&#x27;s site. To the north of the Officers&#x27; Quarters, the former parking lot is now a plaza. To the south of the Officers&#x27; Quarters is a garden used for outdoor events. The former shoreline of Lake Ontario is outlined on the paving of a pathway along the Quarters. The exterior of the building is being restored, while the use for the building remains undetermined, although considered part of the hotel complex.

According to author Richard Palmisano, the Officers&#x27; Quarters has two ghosts: a little girl hunting for her cat, and the girl&#x27;s father. The building has been on a walking tour for ghosts on the Exhibition grounds.

<text>Bretton Hall College of Education was a higher education college in West Bretton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It opened as a teacher training college in 1949 with awards from the University of Leeds. The college merged with the University of Leeds in 2001 and the campus closed in 2007.

==History==
In 1949 Bretton Hall College, a teacher training college founded by Alec Clegg specialising in innovative courses in design, music and the visual and performance arts, opened in the historic Bretton Hall in West Bretton, Yorkshire. It became an affiliated college of the University of Leeds, which validated its degrees.

The college had financial difficulties, and, with the support of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), merged with the University of Leeds in August 2001. Most of the music, fine art and teacher training courses were moved to the Leeds campus, but visual and performing arts education and creative writing remained at the Bretton site, which became home to the University&#x27;s School of Performance and Cultural Industries.

In December 2004, the university&#x27;s governing body reversed an earlier decision and decided that the Bretton Hall site was not financially viable, and the School of Performance and Cultural Industries should move to the main university campus in summer 2007, allowing all existing Bretton-based students to complete their studies there. The closure was documented on the BBC website by student Clair Parker.

In June 2006 it was announced that Bretton Hall was to be sold to Wakefield Council. On 3 May 2007, John Godber presented &quot;Final Curtain&quot;, a documentary on Bretton Hall, broadcast on BBC Radio 4. On 5 and 6 May 2007, a reunion was organised for the alumni and students of Bretton Hall between 1947 and 2007 as a celebration of the school&#x27;s contribution to the arts industry and also the academic excellence it produced over sixty years. On the Saturday, Mike Levon staged a concert in the Music Salon. In November 2007 it was announced that Bretton Hall would be developed as a luxury hotel and spa.

The Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) was founded in the college parkland by Bretton Hall lecturer Peter Murray, CBE. YSP has become a leading international art centre renowned for art and performance in the landscape. When the college closed, Yorkshire Sculpture Park took over the estate grounds and lakes.

In May 2013 a series of special visits to the former hostels (halls of residence) was co-organised by Wakefield Council, YSP, the developer Rushbond and Bretton Hall alumni. Photographs were taken of every hostel room. A further event was organised in September 2013 to visit the mansion. Rushbond will ensure that a complete photographic record will be taken of the building before refurbishment.

<text>Willehad or Willihad (); 745 AD 8 November 789) was a Christian missionary and the Bishop of Bremen from 787 AD.

==Life==
Willehad was born in Northumbria and probably received his education at York under Ecgbert. He was a friend of Alcuin. He was ordained, and about the year 766, he went to Frisia, preaching at Dokkum and in Overijssel, to continue the missionary work of Boniface who had been martyred by the Frisians in 754. At an assembly in Paderborn in 777, Saxony was divided into missionary zones. The zone between the Weser and the Elbe, called &quot;Wigmodia&quot;, was given to Willehad.

From 780 Willehad preached in the region of the lower Weser River on commission from Charlemagne. He barely escaped with his life when the Frisians wanted to kill him and he returned to the area around Utrecht. Once again he and his fellow missionaries barely escaped with their lives when the local pagans wanted to kill them for destroying some temples. Finally, in 780, Charlemagne sent him to evangelize the Saxons. He preached to them for two years but, in 782, the Saxons under Widukind, rebelled against Charlemagne and Willehad was forced to flee to Frisia. A number of his assistants and friends were killed. He took the opportunity to travel to Rome where he reported to Pope Adrian I on his work.

Upon his return from Rome, Willehad retired for a time to the monastery of Echternach, in present-day Luxembourg. He spent two years there working in the scriptorium, and reassembling his missionary team.

After Charlemagne&#x27;s conquest of the Saxons, Willehad preached in the region around the lower Elbe and the lower Weser. In 787 Willehad was consecrated bishop, and that part of Saxony and Friesland near the mouth of the Weser was assigned to him for his diocese. He chose as his see the city of Bremen, which is mentioned for the first time in documents of 782, and built a cathedral there. Praised for its beauty by Anschar, it was dedicated in 789. He also built a small church at Blexen.

Willehad died in Blexen upon Weser, today a part of Nordenham. He is buried in the city&#x27;s cathedral, which he consecrated shortly before his death on 8 November 789. Anschar compiled a life of Willehad, and the preface which he wrote was considered a masterpiece for that age. In 860, a sick girl from Wege (Weyhe) traveled to his grave. There, she was reportedly cured by a miracle. This was the first time the small village was mentioned in any historical documents.

<doc id="1144784" wikidata="Q2369237" url="?curid=1144784" title="Jeremy Bulloch">
<text>Jeremy Andrew Bulloch (16 February 1945 – 17 December 2020) was an English actor. In a career that spanned six decades, he gained recognition for originating the physical portrayal of Boba Fett in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, appearing as the character in the films &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). Bulloch returned to the franchise for a cameo as Captain Colton in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

==Early life==
Bulloch was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, to Aziz &quot;Diana&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Meade) and McGregor Bulloch, an aeronautical engineer. He was the middle of three siblings, with three older half-brothers from his mother&#x27;s earlier marriage. He attended St Leonard&#x27;s School, Blandford Forum, Dorset, and Dorset House, Littlehampton, West Sussex, before training at the Corona Academy theatre school, London. From the age of five, he enjoyed acting and singing after a school show. He began acting at the age of ten and &quot;appeared in [several] Disney films, British sitcoms and plays&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
At the age of twelve, Bulloch&#x27;s first professional appearance was in a breakfast cereal commercial. After several uncredited screen appearances, Bulloch&#x27;s first regular role was in the 1960 TV series &quot;Counter-Attack!&quot; and (the same year) &quot;The Chequered Flag&quot;. He went on to have a recurring role in &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot; (1961) and a regular role in &quot;The Newcomers&quot; (1965–1967). At the age of seventeen, he portrayed Hamlet on stage.

In 1962, he appeared with Cliff Richard in the musical film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;. He had a part in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Agent&quot;, which also starred Christopher Lee who later portrayed Count Dooku in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. He also appeared in two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, &quot;The Space Museum&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1973). Coincidentally, David Prowse and John Hollis, who both would later appear alongside Bulloch in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, also appeared in a Jon Pertwee-era &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial. In 1973, he appeared in the Malcolm McDowell comedy/musical &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;. From 1979 to 1981, he was a regular in the ITV sitcom &quot;Agony&quot;, in which he played Rob Illingworth, one half of a gay couple. His later television roles included a recurring role as Edward of Wickham in &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984–86). He also had minor roles in three James Bond films, twice playing Smithers, an assistant to Q.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
In a career spanning over half a century, Bulloch is best known for his role in Boba Fett&#x27;s costume in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, despite the character&#x27;s &quot;minimal screen time.&quot; Toby Hadoke writes that &quot;his precise body language and smouldering presence were ... integral to the character&#x27;s appeal.&quot; The voice was provided by Jason Wingreen originally and in the updated versions by Temuera Morrison, to strengthen the connection with the Prequel Trilogy. Bulloch&#x27;s half-brother, Robert Watts, who was working as an associate producer for &quot;Empire&quot;, was tasked with finding someone who &quot;would fit in the costume of Boba Fett.&quot; So Watts called Bulloch (who at the time was working on &quot;Agony&quot;) and encouraged him to see Tiny Nicholls, the wardrobe supervisor and Bulloch had a costume fitting as Boba Fett, which &quot;took 20 minutes to put on.&quot;

Additionally, he played a minor role as an Imperial officer (later identified as Lieutenant Sheckil), who grabs Leia when she warns Luke Skywalker of Vader&#x27;s trap in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Bulloch was initially to do the scene as Fett when he fires at Skywalker on Cloud City, but with no one available to play the part, Bulloch went to the wardrobe and got changed into the &quot;Imperial Officer&#x27;s outfit&quot;. This was his only non-masked appearance in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. John Morton, who portrayed the rebel pilot Dak Ralter (during the Battle of Hoth), covered Bulloch as a body double for Fett when the character confronts Vader in the Bespin hallway during Han Solo&#x27;s torture.

Bulloch returned as Boba Fett for the fan film mockumentary: &quot;Return of the Ewok&quot; chasing Wicket on the Death Star. He filmed his scenes for &quot;Jedi&quot; for four weeks. Bulloch was unaware of Fett&#x27;s apparent demise prior to filming and was disappointed, since he would have liked to do more with his character. Bulloch said that portraying Fett was the most uncomfortable role he played and that putting on the jetpack &quot;was very heavy.&quot; Fett&#x27;s death in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; would later be retconned in the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, in which Bulloch had no involvement.

While portraying Fett, Bulloch drew some inspiration from Clint Eastwood&#x27;s the Man with No Name. Both Fett and Eastwood&#x27;s character in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; wear similar capes, cradle their gun, ready to shoot and move in slow motion.

In 2004, Bulloch published a limited edition memoir, &quot;Flying Solo&quot;, which is a humorous account of his personal and professional life, interspersed with tales from the convention circuit. In 2005, for the first time in 22 years, he once again made an appearance in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. This time he portrayed Captain Jeremoch (a portmanteau of Bulloch&#x27;s name) Colton piloting Kenobi, Bail Organa and Yoda to Coruscant in an Alderaan Cruiser (later identified as the &quot;Sundered Heart&quot; and similar to the first vessel to appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot;). Afterwards, Bulloch played a small cameo role in &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan films &quot;Order of the Sith: Vengeance&quot; and its sequel &quot;Downfall – Order of the Sith&quot;, alongside David Prowse and Michael Sheard. These fan films were made in England in support of Save the Children.

In an interview in 2013, he expressed an interest in being involved in a future &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in some way, saying, &quot;The lovely thing is ... if I&#x27;m wearing a helmet, no one knows how old I am.&quot; He subsequently denied involvement in future projects. Although Boba Fett did not appear in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, Bulloch hinted that a film focusing on the origins of Boba Fett would be made. &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, a Disney+ television series taking place after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, premiered in 2021.

He was featured in the 2015 documentary &quot;Elstree 1976&quot;; a behind-the-scenes film, which focuses on the lives of some actors and extras who appeared in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy. The documentary had a premiere at the BFI London Film Festival.

He was also featured in the 2021 Disney+ documentary special, &quot;Under The Helmet: The Legacy of Boba Fett&quot; which celebrates the origins and legacy of the character.

===Other work===
In 2004, Bulloch had a cameo in Mark Hamill&#x27;s &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot; which also featured some &quot;Star Wars&quot; alumni such as David Prowse and Peter Mayhew. In 2005, he played the role of &quot;Chairman Skellon&quot; in a stage production of &quot;The Trial of Davros&quot;. In 2006, Bulloch provided the voice of &quot;Sir Logan the Prowler&quot; in the &quot;Night Traveler&quot; multimedia adventure series produced by Lunar Moth Entertainment.

In 2008, Richard LeParmentier, known for his portrayal of Admiral Motti in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, worked on &quot;Motti Now&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, featuring Bulloch and other &quot;Star Wars&quot; actors, including Kenneth Colley, Garrick Hagon and Jerome Blake.

==Personal life==
Bulloch was married to Maureen Walker; the couple had two sons and lived in London. He had another son from a previous marriage. His half-brother was Robert Watts, who was a producer on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films. Watts also had a cameo as Lieutenant Watts in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. His son Robbie portrayed Matthew of Wickham in four episodes of &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;. The character is the son of Edward of Wickham portrayed by Bulloch. Another son is the translator Jamie Bulloch. His sister Sally Bulloch was a child actress before becoming an executive manager of the Athenaeum Hotel.

He once considered being a sportsman but ultimately chose to go into acting. Long before portraying Fett, Bulloch trained with David Prowse at his gym in South London. In his spare time, he enjoyed playing cricket and travelling. Bulloch said that he had been a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot; ever since the original series.

Following the release of the &quot;Star Wars Special Edition trilogy&quot;, prequel trilogy and new films, he was frequently invited to science fiction conventions throughout the world, and was inducted as an honorary member of the 501st Legion costuming organisation in May 2002. Later, in November 2009, he actually joined the 501st as a costume-wearing member making appearances with the group as Boba Fett. Beginning in 2000, he was a frequent guest at the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Weekends (held annually at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios). In August 2018, Bulloch announced his retirement from attending conventions.

==Death==
Bulloch died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease (which he had lived with for several years) at St. George&#x27;s Hospital in Tooting, London, on 17 December 2020, at the age of 75.

<doc id="1144785" wikidata="Q953645" url="?curid=1144785" title="South Elmsall">
<text>South Elmsall ( ) is a town and civil parish in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. South Elmsall lies to the east of Hemsworth. The town had a population in 2001 of 6,107, increasing to 6,519 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The town was largely a small farming settlement until the industrial revolution and the sinking of collieries caused a boom in population and a need for modern housing for the workforce. This has left a town with a mixture of stone and brick buildings. The town and its neighbours were mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. Other industries such as quarrying for stone, agriculture and brick manufacture were also known at different periods of the town&#x27;s history, with many of the former buildings and sites associated with them still existing.

==Former quarry site==
The former South Elmsall quarry was deemed a site of national importance, by Defra, due to the visible section of an unusually complete patch coral reef.

==Coal mining==
The town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest deep coal mines in the United Kingdom. The colliery invested in several improvements that were of benefit to the area, including the building of the Warde Aldam Hospital, as well as swimming baths and sports facilities.

The colliery became a key source of union radicalism. During the UK miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike. The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners&#x27; picket.

The colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). In 1998 the UK Governments &quot;Social Exclusion Unit&quot; published a series of &quot;Policy Action Team&quot; reports looking at issues of social exclusion. The Skills report used South Elmsall and surrounding towns as a case study and stated &quot;The local communities still suffer from serious
environmental, social and economic problems - and a crisis of morale - as a result of the loss of jobs in the mining industry&quot;.

==Warde-Aldam Hospital==

The Warde-Aldam Hospital was a hospital situated in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1911 by Carlton Main Colliery Ltd and was used as a general, voluntary hospital until 1948. It was then taken over by the NHS and provided acute hospital care until 1978.

==Music==

The town is home to Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, a successful brass band who have been British and European champions.

==Frickley Country Park==

Frickley Country Park officially opened in September 2009, after a long period of land reclamation, environmental cleaning and landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site was finished. The site offers walks and play areas as well as space for new housing development as part of the wider regeneration scheme. Nearby is located the Frickley Off-road Centre, a specialist facility for motorsports.

==Local economy==
The large, traditional market is a central feature of the shopping area of the town, with approximately 105 trading stalls. On the main high street there are shops featuring many household names such as The Post Office, Hallmark Cards, Specsavers, Boots Group and Greggs alongside many other independent shops offering a range of goods and services such as travel, boutique fashion, wedding dress hire, sportswear, a flooring and furniture store and much more.

On the outskirts of the town is the Dale Lane Industrial Estate which is home to a number of large, internationally recognised companies. For example, there are a number of Next Distribution warehouses. The estate itself reflects the change in industry of the area, being one of the key expansion areas since the closure of the local collieries.

==Education==

Carlton, Moorthorpe, Northfield and Ash Grove Academy are the primary education schools in South Elmsall. The main source of secondary and further education in the town is Minsthorpe Community College, which also provides places to residents of South Kirkby and Upton. In 2008 Minsthorpe Community College gained its best ever results at all levels – KS3/GCSE/A-Level, the college GCSE results are higher than the local and national averages.

The school also hosts a number of other facilities such as a sports and fitness suite, all weather floodlit sports pitches, a gym and an upcoming public swimming pool. The school and its science and sporting facilities were upgraded as one of the host training facilities for the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Among a number of well known people who have an association with Minsthorpe include playwright John Godber, actors Adrian Hood and Chris Walker and footballers Jamie and John McCombe.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, and 5 Towns FM, a community online radio station that broadcasts from Castleford.

The town is served by local newspaper, &quot;Wakefield Express&quot;.

<doc id="1144799" wikidata="Q4970946" url="?curid=1144799" title="British Rail coach type codes">
<text>[[British Railways]] coach designations were a series of letter-codes used to identify different types of coaches, both passenger carrying and non-passenger carrying stock (NPCS). The code was generally painted on the end of the coach but non-gangwayed stock had the code painted on the side. They have been superseded by TOPS design codes.

==Background==
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway developed systems of identifying railway carriages with alphabetic codes. When British Railways was formed in 1948 it adapted the LNER system.

==Basic principles==
The codes are made up from a combination of letters, some of which can indicate more than one word; their meaning can only be determined according to their position in the code or the presence of other letters. The letters are:
These letters (except &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;) did not usually apply to passenger-rated but goods carrying vans (e.g. parcels vans, horse boxes, milk and fish vans). Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description, e.g. GUV for General Utility Vans.

==List of codes used==
The following list lists those codes that were used on BR cross-referred to the comparable code used by the LMS, with the exception that the letter &quot;S&quot; (&quot;&quot;Second&quot;, later &quot;Standard&quot;) is used where until 1956 the letter &quot;T&quot; (&quot;Third&quot;) was used. Suffix codes &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; are not shown, as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types.

In the LNER system, &quot;S&quot; stood for &quot;Second&quot;&quot;, a class between &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Third&quot; (which became &quot;Second&quot; on 3 June 1956). The original &quot;Second&quot; was more or less abolished in the 1870s as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1844, remaining only in limited use for special services, such as those meeting ships (which retained the three-class system from which railway classifications had originated). In May 1988 BR reclassified &quot;Second&quot; to &quot;Standard&quot; but this did not alter the code.

Multiple unit coaches originally distinguished between open and corridor types by adding the letter O or K at the end (for example, TSO or TSK), and also distinguished coaches with lavatories by adding the letter L at the end (for example DMBSOL) but these fell out of use when corridor stock became less common which enabled the codes to be restricted to no more than four letters.

<text>Árnafjørður () is a town of the municipality of Klaksvík, on the island of Borðoy, in the Faroe Islands. 

Árnafjørður is located at the bottom of a deep inlet, named Árnfjarðarvík, &quot;corner fjord&#x27;s bay&quot;, on the east side of Borðoy. In 1875, an abandoned Norwegian vessel loaded with large amounts of timber drifted ashore at Árnafjørður. The timber was sold at an auction and, because of the sudden surplus, the price for timber decreased significantly. Timber has always been expensive in the Faroes as, other than driftwood, it usually has to be imported.

<doc id="1144806" wikidata="Q855276" url="?curid=1144806" title="Bøur">
<text>Bøur () is a village in the Sørvágur Municipality of the Faroe Islands, 4 km west of Sørvágur, with a population of 75 (2012).

Its location is and its postal code is FO 386. It is linked to the village of Gásadalur by the Gásadalstunnilin tunnel.

Bøur is a small village on the west-side of Vágar on the north side of Sørvágsfjørður, Faroe Islands. It has views over the sea and the rocky islet Tindhólmur with its many peaks, Gáshólmur and the two &quot;drangar&quot;, (tall, pointed clifftops sticking up from the sea). This motif is known on many paintings and photographs.

The old houses in the village are bunched together with narrow lanes between them, and at the western end stands the cosy church, which was built in 1865.

Bøur is an ancient settlement and is mentioned in the so-called Dog Letter dating from 1350 AD, but it is probably older. The village is also mentioned as having a church in a document dated 1710, but it is not known when the first village church was built.

==Eiriksboði==
The best-known story from Bøur tells of a dispute about succession to property. Two brothers, Simun and Eirikur, owned all the village property jointly, but Eirikur was keen to have it divided. In the end Eirikur killed his brother, and then travelled over to Kirkjubøur to beg the bishop for mercy. The bishop was inclined to grant him absolution if he paid a large penalty to the bishop and to the church. Eirikur agreed, and the contract was carved out on a wooden beam.

Eirikur sailed back to Bøur, but when he reached the still waters and thought he was out of danger, a great wave rose up, the boat capsized, and he was drowned. The hidden reef has been known ever since as Eiriksboði in memory of the event, and is situated on the inner side of Tindhólmur.

==To Steal Fire==
The village land consists of eighteen fields of enclosed and open land, most of it being owned by the king (and is now national property). Another old story tells how ownership passed to the king. The settlement was very tiny at the time, perhaps only a single household, and one day the fire in the hearth went out. This meant an ignominious journey to the next settlement to ask for fire, and a young girl was sent off to Sørvágur. She was lucky and found nobody at home, so she took some burning wood from the fire and hurried back home. Unfortunately the smoke from the fire had been seen, and the farmer from Sørvágur accused her of stealing the fire. As a penalty, most of Bøur became royal estate property.

<text>Democratic Alternative (; ) was a political party in Finland. Deva was formed in 1986 by expelled members of the Communist Party of Finland and its mass front Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League. In 1990 Deva disintegrated and its members joined the Left Alliance, a merger of SKP and SKDL, founded earlier that year.

Deva consisted of Communist Party of Finland (Unity), Revolutionary Youth League, Women&#x27;s Democratic Action Centre, Socialist Students&#x27; League and Democratic Civic Association. The Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (STP) had candidates on Deva list in the 1987 election, but STP was never a member of Deva.

Deva contested the 1987 parliamentary elections and won 122,181 votes (4.24%). Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen, Ensio Laine, Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi and Esko-Juhani Tennilä were elected MPs. Jouko Kajanoja was the party candidate in the 1988 presidential election. Kajanoja gathered 44 428 votes (1.44%). The electors on Deva list got 56,528 votes (1.89%). In the 1988 local elections, 127 Deva councillors were elected to over 70 municipality councils. Their best results were in Karkkila (19.6%, 7 councillors) and Nokia (15.5%, 6). Deva also participated in trade union and cooperative elections.

<text>The Hull Barnsley &amp; West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo.) was opened on 20 July 1885. It had a total projected length of but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&amp;BR) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885.

The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull &amp; South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway).

Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER). Following incorporation into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function – notably Cannon Street station and the Springhead Locomotive Works.

Closure of the greater part of the main line itself came during the time of British Railways. As of 2011 the elevated line in Hull with some of the extensions and alterations added by the NER and LNER are still in use and referred to as the Hull Docks Branch and as the Engineer&#x27;s Line Reference of HJS.

==Background==
By the 19th century the coalfields of southern Yorkshire were producing large amounts of coal, the industrialised midland region was making manufactured goods, and the new industrial towns of the West Riding of Yorkshire and of Lancashire were producing cloth and other goods. Thus opportunities for trade, export and profit existed along the east coast of England as well as along the Humber and the tributary rivers feeding it.

Goole had risen from nothing as a port on the Ouse with the creation of the Knottingley to Goole Canal in 1826 by the Aire and Calder Canal Company; the port, built to generous specifications rapidly gained inward and outward trade – much to the chagrin of Hull, and spurred the development of the extension of the Leeds and Selby Railway to Hull which opened in 1840. Additionally the North Eastern Railway – which had a monopoly on rail transport to Hull – prevented other rail companies investing there, and so Goole gained its own railway by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (later part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) in 1848. A custom-built railway dock and the use of specialised coal barges and unloading facilities, as well as the backing of the Aire and Calder Canal company, made it a very viable competitor to Hull for trade.

Additionally, as a competitor to the port of Hull (and equally well placed for European trade), Grimsby began to grow after the 1840s when the Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company built a rail connection, and the Royal Dock was completed in 1852.

Hull had expanded rapidly during the 18th century with shipping tonnages increasing over ten times in that period, and numerous docks supplementing and connecting Old Dock (Queen&#x27;s Dock) being built by the Dock company in the 19th: Humber Dock 1809, Junction Dock (Prince&#x27;s Dock) 1829, by 1846 Railway Dock connected to the Hull and Selby Railway (later part of the NER), as well as Victoria Dock (1850), Albert Dock (1869) and St Andrews Dock (1883). Despite all this activity, the Dock company was criticised for lack of action – specifically with regard to construction of facilities that would make Hull a foremost coal-exporting port. Additionally, the NER – whose interests in the north-east of England were in competition with Hull, and which held a monopoly on rail transport to Hull – was viewed with mistrust, suspicion, dissatisfaction and even hate, so much that schemes for independent railways or a company other than the NER were proposed that would build a line to Hull, including a bridge over, and tunnels under, the Humber were being actively promoted by Hull merchants.

The situation became untenable when, in 1872, with the NER refusing or unable to transport shipments from the port, deliveries of fish were delayed, and there was a general traffic jam on the rails: 
The plans finally found fruition in 1880 in the charge of Col. Gerald Smith (a Hull banker) and through the cooperation of the Hull Corporation (including the sale of land to the railway, and an investment of £100,000). As part of the Hull Corporation&#x27;s involvement with the scheme came the power to veto any joint workings with other railway companies or selling or leasing of land, and despite the opposition of the NER (which had been instrumental in blocking previous plans), the Bill of Parliament was passed with minor alterations on 26 August 1880. The company The Hull, Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (formed 1879) began work on the new line and associated deep-water dock which was completed by 1885.

==The HB&amp;WRJ Railway and Dock company==

In full, the Hull, Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock company.

===Construction (1880–1885)===
For construction of the line Parliament authorised a share issue of £3,000,0000 and loans of £1,000,000. The engineer for the main line was William Shelford, whilst Stephen Best was responsible for the Hull section, and Benjamin Baker designed the Alexandra Dock. The contractors were Messrs. Lucas and Aird.

The line was one of the earlier built with the aid of steam navvies. The spoil excavated by men and machines from tunnels and cuttings was used to build embankments elsewhere Around 8,000 navvies, including both Scots and Irish as well as English, were employed in the constructions, the largest concentration of which was to be found at Riplingham (near to the Drewton tunnel). The average wage was 15 shillings for a 58-hour week.
The Weedley Tunnel was not originally planned; the track was to skirt the hill to the south. However unstable ground meant that the line tunnelled through the hill instead. The South Kirby tunnel passed through Magnesian Limestone to reach the lower beds of sandstone, and clay. Excavation of tunnels and cuttings included the practice of tunnelling into the rock, placing charges, then moving up the contractors wagons and detonating the charges so that the blasted rock would fall into the wagons.

One of the notable features of the line was the number of bridges it required, a result of the elevated nature of the Hull section where it crossed roads, waterways, and the line of the NER. Additionally, being built after the Railway Mania of the 1840s it had to cross numerous already existent lines in southern Yorkshire. Over one hundred bridges were required, with over 20 within the urban area of Hull alone.
The majority (eighty eight) of the bridges were of plate girder construction with usually three plate sides (one central) supporting cross-beams on which the track was supported. For longer spans a girder &quot;N&quot; truss design was used These larger bridges incorporate rollers on one end to allow for the thermal expansion of the bridge. For other long spans, and for the two swing bridges on the line (Ouse and Hull bridges), open girder truss of approximately parabolic shape (open truss bowstring) were used. Both swing bridges were manufactured by Messrs. Handyside of Derby.

In addition to wrought iron bridges, brick arches were also used, both for crossing small dykes and country lanes, as well as the abutments to bridges and in place of embankments on short sections between bridges.

At Beverley Road, Willerby &amp; Kirk Ella, North Cave and Wallingfen were two-storey buildings with the upper storey accessing the embanked track. Stations were built in the English Queen Anne revival style – with decorative external brick courses between floors and brick lintels; minor embellishments on other brick structures such as bridge buttresses roughly echoed the same style.

In July 1884 work stopped for 5 months, through a failure to raise funds through a share issue to pay the workers. Parliament allowed the additional debts to be taken for the work to continue, by completion the total share issue was £6,000,000 and the loans £3,500,000. At this point the line was almost complete but the subsequent cost cutting meant that the planned grand terminus close to the centre of Hull was never built.

===Description of the Line and assets===

====Hull to Springhead====

Much of the assets of the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company lay in Hull. The line terminated in Hull at three main points: Alexandra Dock; for import and export of goods by sea, Cannon Street station (a goods station and also the passenger terminus), and Neptune Street goods station, the main goods terminus.

The HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo&#x27;s main asset was Alexandra Dock. At the time of its construction it was the largest in Britain at and was expanded by in 1889. The entrance lock was long at wide. Two graving docks, one long and wide, the other a little bigger were also built at the north-east corner of the dock. Its primary purpose was the export of coal; in the opposite direction pit props, as well as cut wood were transported. Distances on the line (mileposts) were measured from Alexandra Dock, and the up direction was from Hull to Barnsley. From here the track rose, joining the embankment, and crossed Hedon Road, beginning its curved route round Hull by numerous bridges, crossing roads, drains, and the North Eastern Railway&#x27;s own track, the first major crossing after Hedon Road being the NER&#x27;s Hull to Withernsea Line. Next was a minor goods yard situated at Burleigh Street, then the Foredyke Stream (a drainage canal) and the NER&#x27;s Hull to Hornsea Line were crossed close together. The line then crossed the River Hull at the Hull Bridge, and then branches (from the down direction) serving Sculcoates goods yard (southward) and the British Gas Light Company&#x27;s gas works (northward). Westward from Sculcoates goods yard a spur ran backwards to serve Hull Corporation&#x27;s own electricity power plant (opened 1895). After Sculcoates junction and the Beverley and Barmston Drain came Beverley Road junction where the line from Cannon Street station coming from the south-east joined the westward-travelling main line.

The branch to Cannon Street station first passed Beverley Road station, almost immediately after the junction. Beverley Road station was a two-storey building with the upper storey accessing the embanked track. The line then curved south and after a 1 in 50 descent reached the level again and terminated at Cannon Street. Initially Cannon Street was intended to be a carriage shed with the main station building situated closer to the centre of town at Charlotte Street near Kingston Square where the company&#x27;s offices where located. Lack of funds, and the expense of purchasing expensive real estate in the centre of the town meant that Cannon Street became the main terminus. The station was in one of the most densely populated areas of the town, close to the river and its associated seed oil and varnish works, the buildings being quickly constructed of wood, and surrounded by the company&#x27;s own coal yards, all of which would have given a poor impression compared with the facilities offered by the NER.

From Beverley Road junction the main line continued west crossing Newland Avenue, and the NER&#x27;s Hull to Cottingham Line before reaching a triangle of track (or Wye) where a line turned south to terminate at Neptune Street goods station.

Before reaching Neptune Street, after a branch to a smaller goods station at Dairycoates to the east of the north–south track, the line curved east and crossed the NER&#x27;s main line to Paragon Station at Hessle Road junction by an open girder truss bowstring bridge.

From the wye of track at Springbank junctions on the route towards Barnsley the line continued west past the Springhead works. The works were built on green-field land north of the main line outside the then area of urbanisation of Hull, and expanded considerably post opening. At Springhead, south of the main line, there was a through goods loop which also gave access to a considerable area of sidings operated from 1908 onwards. From the Springhead yard Hull Corporation&#x27;s Springhead Waterworks was supplied with coal to power its steam-driven pumping engine.

====Springhead to Aire junction====

Beyond Springhead the line continued on embanked track towards Willerby and Kirk Ella station, then crossing the small shallow valley at Eppleworth in the foothills of the Yorkshire Wolds by a brick viaduct (locally known as &quot;five arches&quot;). From here the line rose to Little Weighton station via a deep cutting. Then the line reached a high point of after inclines of up to 1 in 100 before entering the Drewton Tunnel after which the descent grade was 1 in 150 for , passing through Sugar Loaf Tunnel and Weedley Tunnel further west, both shorter tunnels of , and then South Cave and North Cave stations.

Beyond North Cave the land is flat, and the line turned steadily south-west aiming for Barnsley, passing through Newport, Sandholme, and Eastrington, before passing over the NER&#x27;s Hull to Selby Line followed by Howden and Barmby stations. The next major obstacle of the River Ouse was crossed by a swing bridge at Long Drax. The minor station of Drax preceded a crossing under the NER&#x27;s Selby to Goole Line after which was Carlton station and then the first of the junctions with other railways through which the Hull and Barnsley obtained much of its traffic.

====South of Aire junction====
Almost immediately after a bridge crossing over the River Aire, a branch heading north–south joined the line at Aire junction; this was jointly operated by the H&amp;BR and Great Central Railway which opened in 1916 and was known as the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Line.

Less than south-west of Aire junction a westward junction (Gowdall junction) connected the H&amp;BR to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) at Hensall junction via a short chord. The main line continued south-west and crossed over the same L&amp;Y line (the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway then owned by the L&amp;YR). About further on the line crossed over the NER main line to Selby (the former East Coast Main Line via Shaftholme and Selby. The line then crossed the Knottingley and Goole Canal, then went over another L&amp;YR line (connecting Knottingley to Shaftholme junction) before arriving in Kirk Smeaton station.
After Kirk Smeaton the terrain becomes hilly again, but with Magnesian Limestone replacing the softer chalk found in the Wolds; after a cutting the line entered the South Kirby Tunnel (commonly known as the Barnsdale Tunnel) before reaching Wrangbrook Junction. Here the South Yorkshire Junction Railway (opened 1894) branched south and then south-east ultimately for Denaby, whilst The Hull &amp; South Yorkshire Extension Railway (opened 1902) branched soon after travelling roughly south towards Wath, whilst the line heading for Barnsley continued roughly west-south-west.
After Upton the line crossed over the Swinton and Knottingley joint line (Midland and North Eastern railways), shortly after a branch west from Hemsworth East junction connected the line to the West Riding and Grimsby joint line which was operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire (&quot;after 1897 the Great Central&quot;) and Great Northern railways; which was then passed over by the continuation of the H&amp;BR main line. The next station was Hemsworth.

The final tunnel on the line was Brierley Tunnel which is long. The line then passed westward through Brierley junction where a southward-turning chord connected with the Dearne Valley Railway on which the H&amp;BR had running powers. A northward continuation of the Dearne Valley Railway was then passed under.

Finally Cudworth was reached: first was Cudworth Goods station; then Cudworth North junction, where the line split into two main branches; a third branch west joined the Midland Railway via goods exchange sidings. The westernmost of the two main branches crossed the Midland Line by girder truss bridge, then a spur to Monk Bretton station left west, whilst the final part of the line continued to Stairfoot junction where it joined the Great Central main line. The easterly branch ran to Cudworth station where there was a platform, but no connection.

The line&#x27;s second locomotive depot was found at Cudworth, as well as marshalling yards. The whole main line as built was double tracked.

===Operation and events (1885–1922)===
The HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo. began business with large amounts of debt, and within a year of its opening a price war had begun between the Hull Dock Company and the Hull and Barnsley on dock charges, and between the Hull and Barnsley and the NER on transit charges. Neither of the two Hull-based companies could expect to win against the much larger North Eastern Railway. By 1887 the HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo. was seeking a way out of debt and approached the Midland Railway for a possible merger. Reasonable terms were made, but the proposal was rejected by the shareholders of the Hull company. An amalgamation by the NER itself was then proposed, which would have included the NER paying off the HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo.&#x27;s debts; this scheme too was rejected.

The Hull and Barnsley, unable to pay its debts, went into receivership for two years until 1889. The Hull Dock Company amalgamated with the NER in the early 1893, – requiring another act of parliament – one condition of which was that in the event of the NER building another dock in Hull (which had already been planned in 1891 as part of an unsuccessful merger attempt between the HB&amp;WRJ and the NER) the Hull and Barnsley should give its consent, and be able to make the new dock a joint operation between the two railway companies. Additionally an agreement was reached that there would be no reduction in dock duties without prior agreement or discussion.

In 1894 the South Yorkshire Junction Railway opened. Though independent, it was worked by Hull and Barnsley engines, and connected the company to more collieries.

In the following years of the 1890s various proposals, including another to merge the NER and HB&amp;WRJR&amp;DCo., and others for expansion of the Hull docks came, but were blocked by one party&#x27;s interests or another&#x27;s. Finally in 1899 both railway companies had agreed to the construction of a new dock, to the east of Alexandra Dock, access to which was from the HB&amp;WRJ&#x27;s elevated line via an extension from Alexandra Dock, and from a joint line branching off the H&amp;BR at Bridges Junction.

In 1902 an extension from Wrangbrook junction opened, connecting to Wath and further collieries. From 1905 cooperation with the Midland allowed trains to run all the way to Sheffield via Cudworth; the same year Edward Watkin, nephew of Sir Edward Watkin, became general manager of the company. For these express trains bogie coaches were purchased and M. Stirling&#x27;s 4-4-0 tender locomotives used. From 1907 at Sandholme there were marshalling yards and a turntable, enabling freight trains to be split in two for the steep section towards Hull into the Wolds hills.

After exiting receivership, the fortunes of the Hull and Barnsley recovered and it began to pay reasonable dividends on ordinary stock. In 1905 the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company officially changed its name to the shorter Hull and Barnsley Railway. The same year running powers were obtained and a junction made with the Dearne Valley Railway. Also in that year the National Radiator company opened in Hull. The site was served by a siding from Ella Street on the H&amp;BR line, as well as being accessed by a siding from the NER on the Hull to Bridlington line, forming a non-official line link between the networks of H&amp;BR and NER.

Construction of the new dock – &quot;King George V Dock&quot; – was completed by 1914.

In 1916 the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway opened, adding to the number of collieries from which the company could transport coal.

====Engine Sheds====
The following engine sheds were operated by the H&amp;BR:

* Cudworth 
* Hensall 
* Springhead engine shed, Hull
* Alexandra Dock engine shed (Hull)
* Bullcroft
* Denaby
* Millhouses
* Doncaster York Road
* Wrangbrook

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 23 December 1903, a passenger train collided with wagons on the line at Springhead Junction, Hull. Locomotive No.34 with a train of 5 four wheel carriages and a fish van ran into the back of a formation of a brake van and 11 loaded mineral wagons which had detached unnoticed from an earlier train due to a broken coupling. The driver was seriously injured, passengers reported only minor injuries.
*At around midnight 25 September 1907 the boiler of F2 locomotive No. 109 exploded. The train was halted whilst the fireman was collecting a signal token before Wrangbrook Junction near Wath when the boiler exploded. The driver, John Edward Brook, was blown by the blast and was badly scalded and injured; he was taken to Beckett Hospital in Barnsley but died four days later. An inquest was held, where a boiler specialist reported that 30 stays had given way – the stays had been over repaired without replacement; it was noted that suspect stays had been reported in March, and that a boilersmith had previously warned the stays required replacement. A verdict of accidental death was returned, on the basis of an error of judgement having been made.

===Rolling stock and vessels===

====Locomotives====

The H&amp;BR never manufactured any of its own locomotives, all being built elsewhere. The first types in use were of the design W. Kirtley (Locomotive Superintendent of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway) who was acting as a consultant. Matthew Stirling (son of Patrick Stirling of &#x27;Stirling Single&#x27; fame) was the first and only Locomotive superintendent of the H&amp;BR during its independence, and who undertook the rebuilding of some of Mr. Kirtley&#x27;s designs, as well as contracting the construction of his own designs to various builders. His locomotives were typically domeless, and many of the original Kirtley engines were also rebuilt without domes.

Kirtley&#x27;s locomotives were painted black with grey lining. Matthew Stirling subtly modified the livery – using &quot;invisible green&quot; (black except in bright sunlight) produced from a 50:50 mixture of &#x27;drop black&#x27; and &#x27;brunswick green&#x27;. Lining was of broad stripes of blue (ultramarine) with red (vermilion) edges. The 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 tender locomotives procured by Kitley carried a small cursive monogram of the letters &quot;HB&amp;WRJR&quot;, other locomotives carried the initials &quot;H&amp;BR&quot;.

A total of 186 engines were operated by the Hull and Barnsley Railway, on merging into the NER the locomotives were briefly renumbered by adding 3000 to the original number. Following the incorporation into the LNER soon after the surviving locomotives were assigned numbers between 2405 and 2542, in no specific order. Most except the H&amp;BR Class F3 (LNER Class N13) were withdrawn between 1930 and 1940, the B Class beginning withdrawal earlier in 1925. The last F3 was withdrawn in 1956.

====Rolling stock====
Initially the railway used 2-axle coaches, by the time services to Sheffield were introduced the company had 4-axle composite corridor coaches on bogies. Most of the rolling stock was for freight; in 1923 the company had 4,808 freight wagons of which over 3,000 were open wagons. Additionally the company possessed a snow plough, since the cuttings in the Yorkshire Wolds were prone to drifts when snow occurred.

====Ships and watercraft====
The company operated a number of vessels in relation to the construction, operation and maintenance of the Alexandra Dock; those vessels included:
* &quot;Alexandra&quot; – tug built by Earle&#x27;s shipbuilding of Hull in 1885.
* &quot;Barnsley&quot; – tug – a sister of &quot;Alexandra&quot; built in 1886 but not by the same builder.

==History 1922–present==

===As part of the NER (1922–1923)===
The Railways Act 1921 ended the company&#x27;s independence; from 1 April 1922 the Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the NER. The locomotive works at Springhead was downgraded – the extent of locomotive maintenance was reduced and the carriage works closed, skilled workers and machinery were relocated to Darlington. At this time 43 old engines were decommissioned. Edward Watkin (General Manager) and Matthew Stirling also departed. Due to duplication a number of stations were renamed.

Incorporation into the NER was just part of a larger scale of consolidation throughout the British railway system, and on 1 January 1923 the NER along with the Hull and Barnsley Line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

===As part of the LNER (1923–1948)===
Cannon Street station in Hull ceased to be used a passenger station in 1924, this coincided with the construction of a chord to the NER line just north-west of Walton Street level crossing to the elevated line.

Mainline freight work commonly used the ex Great Central Robinson 2-8-0 locomotives (later classified as LNER Class O4). The NER Class P1 0-6-0, NER Class Y 4-6-2T, NER Class T and NER Class T2 0-8-0 locomotives inherited from the NER also replaced Hull and Barnsley types on other freight work.

In 1929 a halt west of Springhead works and sidings was constructed, The station was unstaffed, and possibly the smallest in Britain, with two wooden platforms one coach in length each (25 ft). The same month the Springhead Halt opened passenger services between Wath and Kirk Smeaton ended. Many similar basic stations were built on the early railways for the convenience of staff and passengers. On the Stainland Line from Halifax a small halt was made at the north end of West Vale viaduct to save passengers from having to walk about from the station at West Vale high on the hill above the viaduct.

Passenger services between South Howden and Cudworth ceased in 1932.

===As part of British Railways (1948–1994)===
Mainline freight continued to be worked by 2-8-0 locomotives, with WD Austerity 2-8-0 being ubiquitous. 8F type 2-8-0 locomotives also became common on the southern sections of the line, after through working ended (1958). (A large number of the class were purchased by the LNER from the war department after the Second World War, and in 1948 by the British Transport Commission.)
In 1951 a single sided station halt (Boothferry Park Halt railway station) was built on the branch in Hull between Springhead south junction and Neptune Street to serve the Hull City Football club (directly situated next to the line), the service ended in 1986.

The locomotive shed at Cudworth closed in 1951.

Passenger services between Hull and South Howden ended in 1955. Through freight on the same line ended in 1958, with complete closure between Little Weighton and Wrangbrook junction in 1959. Freight working on remaining sections west of Hull (Springhead) closed completely in the next decade; the section between Moorhouse and Wrangbrook: 1963, between Little Weighton and Springhead : 1964, between Wrangbrook and both Monckton as well as Sprotborough in 1967, Cudworth to Monckton in 1968.

In Hull the bridge over the NER main line at Hessle Road was removed in 1962 and the elevated H&amp;BR dock branch section became connected to the Hull to Selby Line at Hessle Road junction as part of a scheme to reduce the number of level crossings in Hull by routing all rail traffic to east Hull via the elevated Hull and Barnsley Line.

All traffic from Cudworth to Wrangbrook junction ended in 1967. The branch to Cannon Street closed completely in 1968. By 1970 the only parts of the line still with traffic were the Hull elevated section, and a few short sections with industrial uses. Alexandra Dock closed in the 1980s and the rail connection was removed, subsequently the dock re-opened but without a rail connection.

Part of the elevated line to King George Dock was converted to a single line in 1988 and one train working introduced, four years later increased amounts of imports; specifically coal; meant that staffed (tokenised) working was reintroduced in 1992.

Part of the path of the line between Hensall and Drax was opened for Merry Go Round trains to Drax Power Station in 1972, the Long Drax swing bridge on the Ouse to the north-east offered a link for future developments and was maintained until 1968, but was dismantled in 1976.

===Post privatisation (1994–)===

====Hull Docks Branch====

In 2007 over £10 million was allocated to a project to increase capacity on the former Hull and Barnsley Railway branch to the Hull docks. Network Rail, Associated British Ports, Yorkshire Forward, Hull City Council and The Northern Way were involved in funding or supporting the scheme. The work was to include partial re-doubling of the line, remedial and replacement work on the numerous bridges, and signalling upgrades, and to increase the line speed to except at Hull Bridge. The capacity of the line was to be increased from 10 to 22 trains in each direction.

In late 2007 the Network Rail gave the contract to GrantRail (now VolkerRail). Work carried out included the re-instatement of a double track junction at Hessle Road (the junction with the main line, previously singled in 1984), restoration of double track from New Bridge Road to King George Dock, and removal of Ella Street bridge along with strengthening of 15 others. The upgraded line was formally opened in June 2008 by the transport minister Rosie Winterton. Work continued on the line after the official opening; the upgraded signalling system began use in September 2008.

Work on the ABP owned portion of the track was carried out by Trackwork Ltd. of Doncaster, at a cost of over £2.5 million.

In 2013 two bridges were replaced on the docks branch: a minor bridge, over James Reckitt Avenue, replaced at a cost of about £1 million, and a major bridge replacement, over Spring Bank West, costing £3.2 million.

In July 2014 an attempt to solve a pigeon roosting problem under the Chanterlands Avenue railway bridge led to &quot;hundreds of inch long maggots&quot; from the carcasses of dead birds falling off the bridge onto a footpath, described by one passer-by as &quot;like something out of a horror film&quot;.

==Use of closed parts of the line==
Drapers Metal merchants used the Sculcoates, and later part of the former Neptune Street goods yards as part of their scrap metal business – during the 1960s many steam locomotives were dismantled there.

The cutting at Little Weighton, and nearby chalk quarries were used after closure (from 1969) as a landfill facility; filling of the quarries and cutting was approaching completion by 2008. After 2008 a site on the cutting near Willerby has been used as a recycling facility.
In rural areas the embankments and earthworks remain as boundaries between fields, the trackbed west of Weedley Tunnel forms part of the Yorkshire Wolds Way and High Hunsley Circuit walks, and a section of the embankment between Kirk Ella and Hull also carries a footpath whilst a section further west is covered by the B1232 road. A section over long north of Newport is now part of the eastern end of M62 motorway. A number of the stations have been converted into private residences.

The areas of disused land west and east of Calvert Lane in Hull (formerly Springhead works and sidings and the land between Springbank East, West and South junctions) have become a wildlife habitat, the area between the junctions being assessed as &quot;ecologically outstanding&quot;. and are classed as Sites of nature conservance importance and is a candidate site for &quot;Local Nature Reserve status&quot;. The disused railway bridge giving walkers access to the western site was removed in August 2009. The former sidings at Calvert Lane were developed into a small housing estate &quot;The Sidings&quot; in the 2010s.

==Preservation==
The Hull &amp; Barnsley Railway Stock Fund owns and restores the few surviving vehicles which once belonged to the H&amp;BR. Two coaches, two wagons and a tool van are kept on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. No locomotives have survived.

<text>Dalur () is a village in the Faroe Islands. Dalur is located on the east-side of Sandoy.
The village lies in the bottom of a relatively large valley. &quot;Dalur&quot; means &quot;valley&quot; in Faroese.

A little road leads from Dalur to the south-tip of the island. From there it is possible to walk to the bird cliffs &quot;Skorin&quot;.
The church in Dalur was built in 1957 and this is the only church that has ever been here.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 (civilian designation: JT4A) is an axial-flow turbojet engine first flown in 1955. A two-spool design in the 17,000 lbf (76 kN) thrust class, the J75 was essentially the bigger brother of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 (JT3C). It was known in civilian service as the JT4A, and in a variety of stationary roles as the GG4 and FT4.

==Design and development==

In military use, the J75 was used on the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed U-2, and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. It was also utilized in the prototype and experimental Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, Lockheed A-12, Martin P6M-2 SeaMaster, North American YF-107, and Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III.

Before the arrival of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofan engine, the JT4A was used to power certain Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 models, bringing improved field performance in the medium-range Boeing 707-220 and Douglas DC-8-20, and intercontinental range in the Boeing 707-320 and the Douglas DC-8-30. By late 1959, P&amp;W had considered introducing a turbofan version of the J75, which was to have tentatively been named the TF75 or JT4D. Apparently, little interest was shown by the aircraft industry, so the variant was dropped.

===Marine &amp; power generation===
After its relatively short lifetime in the aircraft role, the JT4A found more enduring use in the naval role, where the FT4 was produced in a variety of models between . Well-known uses include the first all-turbine warships, the Canadian s, as well as the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s s, the 1970s-built icebreakers &quot;Polar Sea&quot; and &quot;Polar Star&quot; (each 3 engines in CODOG configuration), and it was considered for the US Navy&#x27;s . The same basic powerplant saw much wider use as a peak demand power turbine running on natural gas. From its introduction in 1960 over 1,000 FT4s have been sold, with many of them still in operation for electrical generation. Outdated by modern standards, refits are available that add catalytic converters to lower their emissions.

<text>Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, ) was a political party in Finland. The STP was founded in 1973 as split from Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders (TPSL). STP emerged from a group that did not approve of the return of TPSL to the Social Democratic Party.

STP had electoral alliances with Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (SKDL), the mass front dominated by the Communist Party of Finland (SKP) but with little success. When SKP (and SKDL) split in 1985-1986 STP cooperated with Democratic Alternative which was founded by Communist Party of Finland (Unity) (SKPy).

In February 1990, STP chairman Pentti Waltzer said the party would join the new Left Alliance if Democratic Alternative decided to merge with it, which later happened.

<text>Depil () is a village in the Faroe Islands.

Depil is located on the east side of Borðoy between Norðdepil and Norðtoftir. The village has only two inhabitants.

==The Farmstead in Depil==
In the early 19th century the village of Depil was practically derelict. The farmers had left the place, the ownership of the land was in the hands of outsiders, and half the cultivated soil had turned into wilderness again. At the census in 1801, there were only three old people left, and the village was probably abandoned for some years up to 1815.

But in the fall of 1815, a man called Óli Árantsson, born 1766, and his wife Anna Óladóttir moved from Norðtoftir to Depil, and life returned to the ancient village.
The story tells, that it was Guttorm Guttormsson who in 1815 built the oldest part of the farmstead in Depil. The lowest part of the house is younger, and the upper part was built by Tummas í Depli in 1823, who used driftwood as building material.

<doc id="1144829" wikidata="Q10854572" url="?curid=1144829" title="HMV">
<text>HMV is a British music and entertainment retailer, founded in 1921. The brand is owned by JD Sports and operated by Sunrise Records, except in Japan, where it is owned and operated by Lawson.

The retailer was opened by the Gramophone Company on London&#x27;s Oxford Street, who owned the Francis Barraud painting and trademark, His Master&#x27;s Voice. In 1998, it was divested from EMI (successor to the Gramophone Company), to form what would become HMV Group plc. In August 2007, HMV bought rival retailer, Fopp. In April 2013, HMV Group plc was bought by Hilco UK for an estimated £50 million after falling into administration, with some international divisions divested off. In February 2019, British retailer JD Sports acquired the HMV brand, and the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records acquired HMV&#x27;s stores, to operate under license. 

In May 2023, Sunrise Records announced the retailer would return to Ireland, followed by an announcement in November 2023 that the retailer would also enter the Belgian market. In February 2024, Sunrise Records announced HMV would re-enter the Canadian market as an in-store concession within Toys &quot;R&quot; Us locations.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1898, Francis Barraud painted His Master&#x27;s Voice, which depicted his late dog, Nipper, listening to a phonograph. The painting and subsequent trademark rights would be sold in 1899 to the Gramophone Company, using it on its sound equipment, and in 1909, created their His Master&#x27;s Voice record label.

In 1921, the Gramophone Company opened the first dedicated His Master&#x27;s Voice shop at 363 Oxford Street, London, in a former men&#x27;s clothing shop. Composer Edward Elgar participated in the opening ceremonies. In March 1931 the Gramophone Company merged with Columbia Graphophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI), with the Gramophone Company becoming part of EMI.

The original HMV shop was severely damaged by a fire in 1937, but was rebuilt and reopened two years later on 8 May 1939. Sir Thomas Beecham opened the new shop.

===Expansion===

In 1966, HMV began expanding its retail operations in London. Throughout the 1970s, the company continued to expand, doubling in size, and in six years became the country&#x27;s leading specialist music retailer. It faced strong competition, however, from Virgin Megastores, established in 1976, and from Our Price, established in 1972, which had numerous high street retail shops around the UK. Subsequently, HMV overtook Our Price in popularity and threatened its existence, having established a chain of newer and larger shops.

The company opened its flagship shop at a new location at 150–154 Oxford Street in 1986, announcing it was the largest record shop in the world at the time, and the official opening was attended by Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence. Growth continued for a third decade into the 1990s, with the company reaching over 320 shops including in 1990 its first shop in the U.S. located at 86th and Lexington in New York City, which was the largest music shop in North America at the time. HMV celebrated its 75-year anniversary in 1996.

In February 1998, EMI entered into a joint venture with Advent International to form HMV Media Group led by Alan Giles, which acquired HMV&#x27;s shops and Dillons, leaving EMI with a holding of around 45%. The new joint venture then bought the Waterstones chain of bookshops to merge with Dillons.

===Flotation===
By 2002, EMI&#x27;s holding in HMV Media was 43%, with Advent International owning 40% and management the remainder. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange later in the year as HMV Group plc, leaving EMI with only a token holding.

HMV operated a loyalty scheme branded as &quot;purehmv&quot;, first launched in August 2003, but subsequently closed and relaunched in 2008. The scheme awarded cardholders points for purchases, which could be collected and redeemed on a number of rewards including vouchers, memorabilia and signed merchandise. &quot;purehmv&quot; has since closed and will be replaced by a new loyalty scheme, the launch date of which is yet to be announced.

The group became susceptible to a takeover following a poor period of trading up to Christmas 2005. Private equity firm Permira made a £762 million conditional bid for the group (based on 190p a share) on 7 February 2006, which was rejected by HMV as an insufficient valuation of the company. Permira made a second offer which increased the value, although HMV declined it on 13 March 2006, subsequently issuing a statement that the offer undervalued the medium and long term prospects for the company, resulting in Permira withdrawing from bidding.

===Acquisitions===

In 2006, the HMV Group purchased the Ottakar&#x27;s book chain and merged it into Waterstones. The merger tied into HMV&#x27;s strategy for growth, as many of the Ottakar&#x27;s branches were in smaller towns. The Competition Commission provisionally cleared HMV Group, through Waterstones, for takeover of the Ottakar&#x27;s group on 30 March 2006, stating that the takeover would &quot;not result in a substantial lessening of competition&quot;. Waterstones then announced that it had successfully negotiated a takeover of Ottakar&#x27;s on 31 May 2006. All 130 Ottakar&#x27;s shops were rebranded as Waterstones prior to Christmas 2006. In March 2007, new group CEO Simon Fox announced a 10% reduction over three years in the enlarged Waterstones total shop space, comprising mostly dual location shops created by the acquisition of Ottakar&#x27;s.

On 29 June 2007, the entertainment retailer Fopp went into administration, with the closure of 81 shops and 800 staff made redundant. On 31 July HMV bought the brand and six shops that it said had traded profitably, saving around 70 jobs.

On 1 September 2008, HMV launched &quot;Get Closer&quot;, a social networking site allowing users to import their own music library, rivalling other providers including online music shops Napster and the iTunes Store. The site was closed in September 2009.

On 24 December 2008, HMV&#x27;s rival Zavvi, successor to entertainment retailer Virgin Megastores, entered administration. On 14 January 2009 a placing announcement by HMV revealed that it intended to acquire 14 of Zavvi&#x27;s shops. On 18 February 2009 five additional Zavvi shops were purchased by HMV Group, to be rebranded as HMV outlets. An additional former Zavvi shop in Exeter&#x27;s Princesshay development was also added. The acquisitions were investigated and cleared by the Office of Fair Trading in April 2009.

In the 2008 MCV Industry Excellence Awards, HMV was given the title Entertainment Retailer of the Year.

In January 2009, HMV bought a 50% stake in MAMA Group, forming a joint venture with the group called the Mean Fiddler Group. The deal introduced the HMV brand to live music venues, including the Hammersmith Apollo. On 23 December 2009, it bought the whole of the MAMA Group in a live music takeover deal worth £46 million.

In September 2009, HMV bought 50% of 7digital for £7.7 million, as part of a strategy to increase its digital content offering. 7digital provided HMV&#x27;s music download service, and the company planned to introduce an e-books service for Waterstone&#x27;s.

In October 2009, HMV established a joint venture with Curzon Cinemas as part of chief executive Simon Fox&#x27;s plan to bring cinemas to HMV and Waterstone&#x27;s shops across England. The first trial cinema opened above the existing HMV shop in Wimbledon, in a former storage room converted into three separate screens and a bar. It has its own entrance, allowing access outside shop hours, and one within the shop. The trial was deemed a success, and it had been planned to open additional cinemas in HMV&#x27;s Cheltenham shop, and Waterstone&#x27;s in Piccadilly, London.

On 5 January 2011, HMV announced that profits would be at the lower end of analysts&#x27; forecasts due to falling sales, resulting in the share price falling by 20% and an announcement of the group&#x27;s intention to close 40 HMV shops, as well as 20 Waterstone&#x27;s bookshops, mainly in towns and cities where the company operated at multiple locations. The first of the shop closures began at the end of January 2011.

The sale of Waterstone&#x27;s to A&amp;NN Capital Fund Management for £53 million was completed on 29 June 2011, and was approved by the vast majority of shareholders at an emergency general meeting.

HMV sold the Hammersmith Apollo to AEG Live and Eventim in May 2012 for £32 million. It sold the remainder of MAMA Group to Lloyds Development Capital in December 2012 for £7.3 million, which also included the company&#x27;s 50% stake in Mean Fiddler Group.

===Administration (2013)===

On 15 January 2013, HMV Group appointed Deloitte as company administrators and suspended shares, putting its 4,350 UK employees at the risk of redundancy. Gift vouchers were initially declared void since holders are classified as unsecured creditors to whom the company owed the value, but were accepted again from 22 January 2013.

Restructuring firm Hilco UK bought HMV&#x27;s debt from its creditors The Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, as a step towards potentially taking control of the company. It was revealed that the total debt Hilco had bought amounted to around £110 million, and that HMV owed around £20 million in tax to HM Revenue and Customs at the time of its entry into administration.

On 31 January 2013, it was reported that 190 redundancies had been made at the head office and distribution centres.

On 7 February 2013, Deloitte confirmed that 66 shops had been identified for closure. No fixed date was given for the closures but they were expected to take place in the following two months. The next day, Deloitte confirmed that an additional 60 redundancies, including the chief executive Trevor Moore, had been made at the group&#x27;s offices in London, Marlow and Solihull. Deloitte confirmed on 20 February 2013 that an additional 37 shops would close. On 26 February 2013, six shops were sold to supermarket chain Morrisons.

On 28 February 2013, eight shops in Hong Kong and Singapore were sold to AID Partners Capital Limited and the operation then became independent from HMV Group that was bought by Hilco UK. This transaction also enabled AID Partners Capital Limited to own the rights to use the HMV brand in Hong Kong, Macau, China, Taiwan and Singapore.

By 23 March 2013, Deloitte was seeking to complete a deal to sell 120 shops as a going concern. The decision to close several shops that had previously been identified for closure were reversed following talks with landlords.

===Hilco ownership (2013–2019)===

On 5 April 2013, Hilco UK announced that it had acquired HMV, taking the company out of administration and saving 141 of its shops and around 2,500 jobs. The total included 25 shops that had previously been selected for closure by Deloitte during the administration process. All nine Fopp shops which HMV owned were also included in the purchase. The takeover deal was estimated at £50 million.

Following the purchase by Hilco UK, it was reported that the company was seeking to reduce the number of shop staff across the business, as part of an effort to save £7.8 million on the wages budget. Shops would lose security staff, cashiers and supervisors, with managers required to provide cover.

HMV launched a music download service in October 2013 (www.hmvdigital.com), provided by 7digital, which includes iOS and Android apps.

The company moved its flagship Oxford Street shop back to the original site at 363 Oxford Street on 23 October 2013. HMV&#x27;s existing flagship shop at 150–154 Oxford Street, formerly the largest music shop in the world, closed on 14 January 2014.

By 2014, HMV had gained the second highest share of the UK entertainment market, behind Amazon. The company&#x27;s filing to Companies House in September 2014 revealed it had made a profit of £17 million in the 11 months since it had entered administration. In January 2015, HMV overtook Amazon to become the largest retailer of physical music in the UK.

HMV relaunched its online shop in June 2015, providing CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and LP records for online order and home delivery with exclusive stock also available.

In June 2015, HMV relaunched an online shop to accompany its existing music download service.

However, the originally safe shops of York, Soilhull, Portsmouth and Belfast would shut.

=== Sunrise ownership (2019–present) ===

On 28 December 2018, HMV confirmed it had again been placed into administration. Hilco UK cited the &quot;tsunami&quot; of retail competition as the reason for the move. On 5 February 2019, Canadian record shop chain Sunrise Records announced its acquisition of HMV Retail Ltd. from Hilco UK for an undisclosed amount. Sunrise had previously acquired the leases for over 70 HMV locations in Canada after HMV Canada entered receivership, which expanded the Ontario-based retailer into a national chain. Sunrise plans to maintain the HMV chain and five Fopp shops, but immediately closed 27 locations, including the flagship Oxford Street branch and other locations with high rent costs.

Company founder Doug Putman stated that he planned to increase the chain&#x27;s emphasis on vinyl phonograph sales as part of the turnaround plan: Sunrise&#x27;s leverage of the vinyl revival had helped bolster the Canadian locations&#x27; performance after the shops&#x27; transitions from HMV, having sold at least 500,000 vinyl LPs in 2017 alone. Putman argued that, despite the growth of digital music sales and streaming, &quot;talk about the demise of the physical business is sometimes a bit exaggerated, especially in music specialists. Most of the decline is coming from nontraditional sellers like the grocery chains. We&#x27;ll be here for quite some time.&quot;

On 25 February 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the Sunrise acquisition was valued at £883,000. Following subsequent negotiations with its landlords, by late-February, HMV reopened 13 of its shops (including one Fopp shop).

The store in Belfast which had previously re-opened up in March 2014 after a £1 million pound refurbishment, was threatened with closure in February 2019. However, a deal was reached with Frasers Group which allowed the shop to continue trading.

In October 2019, the new owners opened the HMV Vault on Dale End, Birmingham, billed as Europe&#x27;s biggest entertainment shop and stocking tens of thousands of CDs and vinyl records and other products.
==== COVID-19 pandemic and 100th birthday (2020–2021) ====
From 22 March to 15 June, and then from 5 November to 2 December 2020 and from 4 January 2021 to 12 April 2021 (in England), all HMV shops were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Into the 2020s, HMV began opening new and relocated shops, including in locations which previously had HMV branches that had earlier shut, such as Solihull. In some cases these new outlets were opened in shops vacated by the demise of other retail chains, particularly Arcadia Group, with an HMV shop opened in Dunfermline premises previously occupied by Burton Menswear and Dorothy Perkins, a return to Broadway Shopping Centre, Bexleyheath – again in former Burton/Perkins premises – nine years after the closure of their previous shop in the town, and a relocation in Wigan from a smaller prior site to larger premises vacated by Topshop/Topman.

In July 2021, HMV celebrated its 100th birthday. In celebration, the firm released 37 limited edition vinyl albums. A 100 track CD compilation entitled &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call HMV&quot; was also released. The album was only available to buy at HMV shops, and online on HMV&#x27;s website, plus eBay.

In 2021, the company began to rebrand, using the motto &quot;The HMV Shop&quot; for shopfronts and social media; the previous logo is still used in most shops (including the flagship HMV Vault shop), and the website.

In April 2023, it was confirmed that HMV had signed up to reopen a new-format shop in their original home at 363 Oxford Street after four years away, during which time the premises had been occupied temporarily by &quot;American candy&quot; outlets, along with other vacated shops on the street. This will be, following runs from 1921 to 2000 and 2013–2019, HMV&#x27;s third stint at 363 Oxford Street.

On 18 May 2023, Sunrise Records announced that HMV would re-enter the Irish market again with a shop on Dublin&#x27;s Henry Street, in a unit previously occupied by the company during their first incarnation. The shop opened on 30 June 2023.

On 21 July 2024, Phil Halliday, the managing director of HMV announced; that there was an increase of customers buying physical media formats of films and television shows commercially released on DVD and Blu-ray.

==International operations==
=== Belgium (2023–present) ===
In November 2023, Sunrise Records announced that HMV would expand into Belgium. In March 2024, it was announced HMV would open its second Belgian location.

=== Canada (1986–2017, 2024–present) ===
In 1986, EMI Music Canada purchased the Mister Sound chain. EMI then attempted to rebrand the sites as His Master&#x27;s Voice stores, but were not granted the rights from RCA who own the rights to &#x27;His Master&#x27;s Voice in the U.S. and Canada. However, EMI were not prevented from using just the &#x27;HMV&#x27; initials, which were sometimes initialised to &quot;Hot Music Values&quot; in radio and television commercials in the 1990s.

In 1991, EMI opened HMV Canada&#x27;s flagship store at 333 Yonge Street in Toronto. The flagship store hosted in-store concerts from Puff Daddy, D&#x27;Angelo, Green Day, Foxy Brown, Ramones, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Backstreet Boys, and NSYNC. A concert hosted by the Red Hot Chili Peppers had the Yonge and Edward Street intersection closed off. The Yonge Street store was also notable for promoting local indie music scene by giving unsigned bands prominent shelf space on the ground floor, as well as hosting in-store concerts and events with Toronto bands.

The retailer also occupied a two-level, 20,000 square foot store in West Edmonton Mall which included an event stage (known as the Phase IV Stage) in front of the store. The Phase IV Stage often hosted musical performances or autograph signings by artists who were making tour stops in Edmonton.

In June 2010, HMV Canada launched purehmv, a customer rewards program that offered store discounts and exclusive items across music, film, and gaming in exchange for points gained in-store. Over 300,000 customers joined the program in its first four months.

In June 2011, HMV Canada sold its stores for £2 million to Hilco Capital, a British firm specialising in retail restructuring.

In late 2011, HMV Canada announced closures of its Downtown Vancouver and Richmond Centre stores.

By 2012, HMV had 113 stores in Canada, down from 121 when it was sold by HMV Group. However, Hilco Capital opened several new stores, including one in Peter Pond Mall in Fort McMurray. In late 2012, Hilco Capital reported they were successful at restructuring HMV Canada, and that there were no plans to cease operations. As part of its strategy, HMV Canada focused on growing back-catalogue music and movies not found at discount rivals, while also carrying higher-margin merchandise like gifts, collectibles, clothing and headphones, while removing video games and technology hardware from sale.

By January 2017, the company had $39 million in debt, after running at a loss since 2014. Hilco Capital stated that financial difficulties, combined with decreasing sales, meant the current situation was not sustainable. On January 27, 2017, HUK 10 Ltd., the shell company owned by Hilco employee, business partner of Nick Williams, and owner of HMV UK, Paul McGowan sued HMV Canada in the Ontario Superior Court. They were successful, and Hilco Capital announced plans to close all HMV Canada locations by April 30, 2017. HMV Canada locations held clear-out sales of their remaining inventory. The flagship store on Yonge Street in Toronto closed on April 14, 2017.

In February 2017, Ontario-based chain Sunrise Records bought the leases of 70 of HMV Canada locations in an effort to convert into Sunrise Records locations, and invited 1,340 former HMV Canada employees to apply for 700 positions. HMV Canada&#x27;s flagship location on Yonge Street in Toronto was one of the several locations that were not part of the deal, and remained vacant. Its head office was located in Etobicoke.

On February 5, 2019, Sunrise Records subsequently announced its intent to buy HMV UK out of administration from Hilco Capital for an undisclosed amount, with the possibility of HMV Canada&#x27;s revival being considered.

In February 2024, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Canada (also owned by Sunrise Records owner Doug Putman) announced that it would begin to introduce HMV-branded store-within-a-store departments at its locations, carrying music, home video, and various pop-culture collectibles. The retailer also returned to online trading.

=== Ireland (1986–2013, 2013–2016, 2023–present) ===
HMV established its first shop in Ireland in 1986 following the retailer&#x27;s expansion to Canada. The first shop to open was on Grafton Street which became very popular for numerous big name Irish acts performing live in the shop. The retailer expanded in Dublin with a second shop on Henry Street and that followed with expansion into Cork in the late 1980s before adding a shop in Limerick City in the 1990s. The retailer expanded with numerous shops in the Greater Dublin region and nationwide again into Galway and Newbridge in the early to mid 2000s.

On 5 February 2011 HMV Ireland announced that its profits had fallen by almost 90% to €465,000, compared to €4.1 million the previous year.

On 16 January 2013, HMV Ireland declared receivership which required the company under Irish law to close all its shops immediately.

In April 2013, Hilco also stated that it hoped to reopen a HMV shop in Ireland following the closure of all shops in the country. Later, on 9 June 2013, it was confirmed that Hilco Capital Ireland had purchased HMV Ireland, and would reopen five shops within six weeks. 

In January 2016, HMV Ireland confirmed the closure of its Galway City shop, and its shop on Dublin&#x27;s Grafton Street, with both to close by the end of that month. This followed the closure of many Xtravision and HMV Xtravision branded outlets at the end of December 2015/early January. In late January 2016, the remainder of Xtravision was liquidated.

In July 2016, Hilco announced it would be closing its five remaining Irish shops, in order to refocus HMV in Ireland as a new digital service (HMV Digital) where customers can stream, rent or purchase music and films online. The new HMV digital service was to launch in Ireland before rolling out into the UK and Canada. However, HMV failed to successfully launch its new digital service in Ireland. All shops closed between 29 and 30 August 2016.

In June 2023, it was announced that HMV would return to Ireland, with a shop in Dublin.

=== Japan (1990–present) ===
In 1990, EMI established HMV Japan. Since JVC Kenwood Holdings (through its JVC and Victor Entertainment subsidiaries) controls the His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark in Japan following a break-up from RCA Records, HMV Japan uses a stylised gramophone of its own design as its trademark. As with the former U.S. and Canadian operations, HMV Japan&#x27;s use of the initials &quot;HMV&quot; has never been challenged.

In July 2007, HMV Japan, which operates 62 shops, was sold to DSM Investment Catorce. The brand, shops and website would continue to trade as HMV, but would no longer be owned by HMV Group.

On 28 October 2010 the Japanese convenience shop giant Lawson acquired all shares of HMV Japan from Daiwa Securities SMBCPI for ¥ 1.8 billion. KK HMV Japan became a part of Lawson, and was renamed KK Lawson HMV Entertainment (株式会社 ローソンHMVエンタテイメント) on 1 December in the same year. Terms of the deal were published on official websites. HMV is currently known in Japan as &quot;HMV &amp; Books&quot;.

== Defunct international operations ==

=== Australia (1989–2010) ===
In 1989, HMV established its first Australian shop in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta, closely followed by a second in Chatswood in the same year. In 1990, HMV opened its flagship shop in the Sydney central business district. The 1,207-square-metre superstore in Pitt Street Mall was the largest music shop in the Southern Hemisphere and sold more CDs than any other shop in the country. It was also awarded the ARIA Charts Store of the Year on three occasions. By 1998, a further 27 shops were opened in key retail centres on the eastern seaboard of Australia, including other large units at Melbourne&#x27;s Bourke Street Mall and Brisbane&#x27;s 585-square-meter Queen Street Mall shop.

In March 2000, HMV made local headlines when its larger rival, Sanity, signed a five-year deal with Festival Mushroom Records for a three-year online exclusivity window on all tracks downloaded from that label at Sanity&#x27;s website. Sanity&#x27;s competitors and other online services were meant to be blocked from Festival Mushroom&#x27;s catalogue for that period unless Sanity agreed to deal with them. Chaos.com and Leading Edge Music both made public threats to boycott Festival Mushroom&#x27;s content, but HMV Australia (whose website did not offer downloading) followed through, removing all CDs from their Australian shops, adding they would do the same overseas. By the next week, Festival Mushroom backed down, stating Sanity would simply be the wholesaler of their digital downloads for the next three years, requiring them to make all products available to other retailers at the time of release.

In October 2005, Sanity&#x27;s owner, Brazin Limited acquired the Australian operations of HMV for A$4 million (£1.7 million). The HMV Group&#x27;s agreement with Brazin was to phase out the HMV brand in Australia by 2010. Immediately after this acquisition of HMV&#x27;s 32 outlets, this put Brazin at its peak with its 74 Virgin Megastore and Virgin At Myer stores, in addition to Sanity&#x27;s 215, and EzyDVD&#x27;s 63 outlets around the country (not counting non-entertainment retail chains within Brazin, such as Bras N Things) and was by far Australia&#x27;s largest entertainment retailer with close to 43% of the music retail market. However, most HMV shops in Australia had very high overhead costs due to their large footprints and expensive locations, thus most were gradually closed upon the end of rental leases. The remaining shops were re-branded to Sanity over the next five years. The horizontal merger was approved by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission the same month, leaving Brazin to merge marketing and general operations within the one entertainment division. Also in October, Brazin launched its Pulse loyalty card after a year of testing in the market. It worked by giving the customer one point for every dollar spent across Brazin&#x27;s shop network, receiving a $5 discount voucher or other offers once 100 points were reached.

By December 2006, HMV had shrunk to 22 outlets from its peak of 32 the year before.

At the end of August 2007, HMV&#x27;s Australian flagship shop in Pitt Street Mall was closed, when the Mid City Centre shopping centre it was located in was closed for renovation, and the large Bourke Street Mall shop closed on 19 February 2008. By mid-2010, the last HMV shop was closed in Brisbane by Sanity, and the last re-branded HMV shop trading as Sanity closed at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre in December 2012.

=== Germany (1990s–2000s) ===
As of April 1998, HMV traded in Germany as HMV Tonträger GmbH, with the business later closed in the 2000s.

=== Hong Kong and Singapore (1990s–2010s) ===

In 1994, HMV opened its first store in Hong Kong at Windsor House, 311 Gloucester Road. Following this, HMV expanded into new shopping malls across the region. The Tsim Sha Tsui flagship store, located at the corner of Peking Road and Hankow Road, was the largest record shop in the territory.

In Singapore, HMV was the second international music store established after Tower Records, which eventually closed. HMV operated a store at Marina Square, and previously had locations at 313@Somerset (which replaced a former shop at The Heeren) and the CityLink underground mall. HMV&#x27;s pricing was generally higher than independent stores and local chains like Gramophone and That CD Shop, but it was the only retailer in Singapore to sell a variety of products, including games, T-shirts, books, and audio gear, alongside music and video.

In the 2000s, HMV Hong Kong partnered with Commercial Radio Hong Kong, renaming one of their channels HMV864 and broadcasting it in all HMV stores in the city. HMV Hong Kong was known for higher prices compared to independent record shops, particularly on non-promotional items. The Hong Kong stores were the second globally, after the UK, to introduce in-store digital kiosks, and the first in Asia. Initially, HMV Hong Kong used the same stylized gramophone logo as HMV Japan but later switched to the Nipper the Dog logo used by HMV UK, minus the gramophone.

On February 28, 2013, Deloitte announced that Hong Kong-based private equity firm AID Partners Capital Holdings had acquired HMV&#x27;s businesses in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the rights to the HMV brand in China, Singapore and Taiwan. HMV&#x27;s 313@Somerset store in Singapore closed in November 2013, and the CityLink store closed earlier.

In September 2015, HMV closed its last Singapore store.

By 21 March 2016, China 3D Digital Entertainment Limited acquired HMV Hong Kong operations from AID Partners Capital Limited, later renamed to HMV Digital China Group Limited.

In December 2018, the Hong Kong operations, which included four stores and an HMV-themed restaurant, were closed.

As of May 2023, a company called HMV Brand Pte. Ltd. retains ownership of the defunct &quot;HMV&quot; and &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; brand in China, Singapore and Taiwan.

=== Qatar (2015–2022) ===
In July 2015, it was announced that HMV had struck a deal with the Qatar-based company, Al Mana Lifestyle, for fifteen stores across Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. There were also plans for Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. However, none of these plans came to fruition, and only one HMV store in Qatar&#x27;s Al Mirqab mall was opened, which later closed in 2022. The Al Mana Lifestyle Trading company retain the rights to the HMV brand across Qatar and Oman, whereas the rights to HMV in other Middle East regions, such as the United Arab Emirates, is owned by Palm Green Capital Limited.

=== United States (1990s–2004) ===
In the 1990s, the chain expanded into the United States, opening several stores along the East Coast, including a prominent flagship location in Manhattan. Similar to Canada, EMI in the U.S. did not have rights to use &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;; as this trademark is owned by RCA. Though, HMV in the U.S. was not prevented from using just the &quot;HMV&quot; initials by themselves.

HMV in the U.S. faced significant competition from rivals such as Tower Records, FYE and Virgin Megastores. The final shop in the United States, having lost £500,000 in 2003 and £1 million in 2004, closed on 3 November 2004.

<text>Eiði (&quot;Northern Faroese&quot; [ˈɔiːjɪ];) is a village located on the north-west tip of Eysturoy in the Faroe Islands. It is the seat of Eiði Municipality. It is located 4 km north of Ljósá and 6.5 km west of Funningur.

==History==
Eiði was first mentioned in writing early in the 14th century. Eiði was settled by Norsemen. The earliest sign of settlement was carbondated to approx. 920 CE. Settlement is likely to have happened earlier. In the centre of the village is Eiði Church. It was founded on September 18, 1881, and was designed in 1879 by Danish architect Hans Christian Amberg.

The LORAN-C transmitter Ejde was previously located just east of Eiði. The transmitter was deemed obsolete in 2015 and was turned off for the final time on 1 January, 2016 and dismantled three years later. It was an important station for submarine navigation during the Cold War. At its peak in the 1960s, the station employed 32 workers.

==Sports==
The village&#x27;s football team is EB/Streymur. It was founded 1993 as a merger between Eiðis Bóltfelag and Ítróttarfelagið Streymur.

==Notable residents==
*Grækaris Joensen (1835–1897), teacher, politician and the first mayor of the municipality
*Hans Pauli Samuelsen (born 1984), football player
*Arnbjørn Hansen (born 1986), football player
*Doris Olafsdóttir (born 1986), football player

<doc id="1144848" wikidata="Q901475" url="?curid=1144848" title="Sodium amalgam">
<text>Sodium amalgam, with the common formula Na(Hg), is an alloy of mercury and sodium. The term amalgam is used for alloys, intermetallic compounds, and solutions (both solid solutions and liquid solutions) involving mercury as a major component. Sodium amalgams are often used in reactions as strong reducing agents with better handling properties compared to solid sodium. They are less dangerously reactive toward water and in fact are often used as an aqueous suspension.

Sodium amalgam was used as a reagent as early as 1862. A synthesis method was described by J. Alfred Wanklyn in 1866.

==Structure and compositions==
No particular formula is assigned to &quot;sodium amalgam&quot;. Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg are well defined compounds. In sodium amalgams, the Hg-Hg distances are expanded to around 5 Å vs. about 3 Å for mercury itself. Usually amalgams are classified on the weight percent of sodium. Amalgams with 2% Na are solids at room temperature, whereas some more dilute amalgams remain liquid.

==Preparation==
Metallic sodium dissolves in mercury exothermically, i.e. with the release of heat, therefore, formation of sodium amalgam is famously dangerous for generating sparks. The process causes localised boiling of the mercury and for this reason the formation is usually conducted in a fume hood and often performed using air-free techniques, such as synthesis under anhydrous liquid paraffin. Sodium amalgam may be prepared in the laboratory by dissolving sodium metal in mercury or the reverse. Sodium amalgams can be purchased from chemical supply houses.

==Uses==
Sodium amalgam has been used in organic chemistry as a powerful reducing agent, which is safer to handle than sodium itself. It is used in Emde degradation, and also for reduction of aromatic ketones to hydrols.

A sodium amalgam is used in the design of the high pressure sodium lamp providing sodium to produce the proper color, and mercury to tailor the electrical characteristics of the lamp.

===Mercury cell electrolysis===
Sodium amalgam is a by-product of chlorine made by mercury cell electrolysis. In this cell, brine (concentrated sodium chloride solution) is electrolysed between a liquid mercury cathode and a titanium or graphite anode. Chlorine is formed at the anode, while sodium formed at the cathode dissolves into the mercury, making sodium amalgam. Normally this sodium amalgam is drawn off and reacted with water in a &quot;decomposer cell&quot; to produce hydrogen gas, concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, and mercury to be recycled through the process. In principle, all the mercury should be completely recycled, but inevitably a small portion goes missing. Because of concerns about this mercury escaping into the environment, the mercury cell process is generally being replaced by plants which use a less toxic cathode.

<doc id="1144849" wikidata="Q3566658" url="?curid=1144849" title="Euroflag">
<text>Euroflag was a collaboration of European aerospace companies formed for the development of the Future Large Aircraft project which was eventually to result in the Airbus A400M Atlas. Development eventually moved under the stewardship of Airbus Defence and Space.

==History==
===Origins===
The project began as the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was set up on 16 December 1982 by France&#x27;s Aérospatiale, British Aerospace, Lockheed of the United States, and West Germany&#x27;s Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm to develop a replacement for the C-130 Hercules and C-160 Transall. Varying requirements and the complications of international politics caused slow progress. A new FIMA agreement was created with the four original participants and new members Aeritalia (predecessor of Italy&#x27;s Alenia Aeronautica) and Spain&#x27;s Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) on 3 December 1987, which was the expiration date of the original FIMA agreement. By May 1989, Lockheed was deep into the planning of a second-generation C-130 that would become a competitor to a FIMA aircraft (the C-130J Super Hercules) despite having invested over US$60 million in FIMA-related studies. On 6 June 1989, Aérospatiale announced that the five European members had formed Euroflag to replace FIMA, and that Lockheed was no longer a participant to create the new military transport because the other members did not want to commit to a specific American partner yet.

===Formation===
In July 1991, with the addition of Alenia Aeronautica, CASA, OGMA, and TAI of Turkey, the Future International Military Airlifter group became Euroflag, European future large aircraft group. a joint-venture company based in Rome.

===Succession===
1995 saw the FLA military transport project in charge of requirement-definition and selection processes, with Airbus Military eventually taking over the project.

<doc id="1144853" wikidata="Q4357603" url="?curid=1144853" title="John Straffen">
<text>John Thomas Straffen (27 February 1930 – 19 November 2007) was a British serial killer who committed the murder of three prepubescent girls between the ages of five and nine in the counties of Somerset and Berkshire, England, between 1951 and 1952.

All three of Straffen&#x27;s victims were murdered by strangulation. His first two victims were murdered in Bath, Somerset, in the summer of 1951. Arrested shortly after the murder of his second victim, Straffen denied any sexual or sadistic motive for the murders, which he insisted he had committed to simply &quot;annoy&quot; the police, whom he blamed for most of his problems.

Tried before Mr. Justice Oliver at Taunton Assizes in October 1951, Straffen was found unfit to plead on the grounds of diminished responsibility and committed to indefinite detention within Broadmoor Hospital. He briefly escaped from this facility in April 1952 and murdered a third child in the village of Farley Hill, Berkshire, in the four hours he remained at liberty prior to his recapture.

Straffen was brought to trial for this third murder at Winchester Assizes in July 1952; he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death, although his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by the Home Secretary. He remained incarcerated until his death within HM Prison Frankland in November 2007.

At the time of Straffen&#x27;s death, he was the longest-serving prisoner in British history, having served over 55 years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Early life==
John Thomas Straffen was born on 27 February 1930 at Bordon Camp in Hampshire. He was the third of six children born to John and Elizabeth ( Morgan) Straffen, with one older brother and sister, and three younger sisters. At the time of Straffen&#x27;s birth, his father served in the British Army, and his mother was a homemaker. When Straffen was two years old, his father was deployed overseas and the family spent six years in British India.

Straffen&#x27;s early childhood was unremarkable. His mother would later recollect her son displayed no signs of mental limitation or behavioural problems until after he was stricken with encephalitis at age six during his father&#x27;s tour of military duty in British India. Shortly thereafter, Straffen began to exhibit traits of antisocial behaviour. The family returned to the United Kingdom in March 1938, settling in a suburb of Bath, Somerset. Shortly thereafter, Straffen&#x27;s father was discharged from the Army.

Shortly after his family returned to England, Straffen began committing acts of petty theft in addition to frequently truanting from school. He was referred to a child guidance clinic for this behaviour in October 1938. Eight months later, Straffen first appeared before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a young girl; he was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation. Straffen&#x27;s assigned probation officer discovered that he did not understand the general difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The Straffen family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and his mother—with five other children—had little time to devote exclusively to her son. As such, Straffen&#x27;s probation officer referred him to a psychiatrist, who officially diagnosed Straffen as a mentally defective individual.

In June 1940, the local council referred Straffen to St. Joseph&#x27;s School, a residential school for mentally defective children in Sambourne, Warwickshire, with instruction he remain housed within structured facilities of this nature until age sixteen. The same year, Straffen underwent an intellectual assessment, which revealed his IQ to be 58 and his mental age to be six years.

Straffen would remain at St. Joseph&#x27;s until 1942, when he transferred to Besford Court School in Defford, Worcestershire. Here, he was observed by staff to be something of a solitary individual and markedly resentful of having been placed in a structured environment by authorities. A second intellectual assessment conducted in the mid-1940s revised Straffen&#x27;s IQ to 64; his mental age was also revised to nine years, six months. He would remain at this facility until March 1946.

===Adolescence===
Straffen was released from Besford Court School shortly after his sixteenth birthday; he returned to live with his family in Bath. The same year, an examination by the Medical Officer of Health concluded that although potentially capable of basic manual labour, he still warranted certification under the Mental Deficiency Act. After several short-term menial jobs, Straffen obtained more stable employment as a machinist in a clothing factory. This employment lasted ten months before he was made redundant in 1947. Shortly thereafter, Straffen began to enter unoccupied local homes and steal small items; he is not known to have taken these stolen artifacts home or given these items to others, but instead typically hid or discarded them. As Straffen had no close friends, he invariably committed these burglaries alone.

On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl reported to police that a blond-haired teenager named John had sexually assaulted her after putting his hand over her mouth and saying: &quot;What would you do if I killed you? I have done it before.&quot; The police were unable to locate the assailant and would only link Straffen to this offence much later. Six weeks after committing the sexual assault, Straffen is known to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a teenage girl with whom he had recently argued.

==HM Prison Horfield==
In the autumn of 1947, Straffen was arrested for burglary; he willingly confessed to the offence in addition to having committed thirteen other burglaries—many of which police had not linked to the same offender. He was remanded in custody and, on 10 October, was committed to HM Prison Horfield in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, with his committal paperwork stating Straffen was &quot;not of violent or dangerous propensities.&quot; Straffen would remain at this facility for twenty months, during which he underwent a psychiatric examination by the medical superintendent, who officially classified Straffen as being intellectually disabled.

Straffen was isolated from other inmates at Horfield and well-behaved. As a result, in July 1949 he was transferred to a lower-security agricultural hostel in Winchester. Here, he initially functioned well, but soon relapsed into committing acts of petty theft within the facility. When he stole a bag of walnuts in February 1950, he was sent back to HM Prison Horfield. Six months later, he was disciplined by staff for leaving the facility without authorisation and resisting police when they attempted to return him to Horfield.

===Unsupervised home leave===
In early 1951, Straffen was examined at a Bristol hospital, where an electroencephalograph reading revealed he had suffered &quot;wide and severe damage to the cerebral cortex&quot;—possibly originating from his being stricken with encephalitis at the age of six. However, Straffen was considered sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed short periods of unsupervised home leave. He used the time to obtain a job at a market garden as an odd-job man using the skills he had honed while residing in Winchester.

==Rehabilitation into society==
News of Straffen independently obtaining employment greatly impressed Hortham officials, and he was allowed to keep his horticultural job. Shortly thereafter, staff authorised Straffen to be returned to the care of his family, who by 1951 resided in Fountain Buildings, Bath.

By law, under the Mental Deficiency Act, Straffen underwent a further psychological assessment by Hortham medical staff shortly after his twenty-first birthday; these officials recommended he remain classified as mentally deficient for a further five years. His family disputed the outcome of this assessment and appealed the decision. Shortly thereafter, 10 July 1951, the Medical Officer of Health for Bath re-examined Straffen and found an improvement in his mental age to ten years; he recommended that Straffen&#x27;s certificate of mental deficiency be renewed only for six months with a view to discharge at the end.

Two days prior to this re-assessment, a seven-year-old girl named Christine Vivian Butcher had been murdered in Windsor, Berkshire. The child had been raped, then strangled to death with the belt from her own raincoat. Her murder was never solved. Although Straffen is not considered a suspect in this case, according to author Letitia Fairfield, the intense police and public outrage generated by the case may have led Straffen—with his lifelong &quot;intense resentment&quot; and &quot;smouldering hatred&quot; of police—to believe the act of strangling young girls would cause maximum frustration and outrage to the authorities.

==Murders==
===Brenda Goddard===
On the afternoon of 15 July 1951, Straffen visited the local cinema unaccompanied, as he typically did on a Sunday. His route took him past 1 Camden Crescent in Bath, where 5-year-old Brenda Constance Goddard lived with her foster parents. Although the child was not allowed to venture out of her garden when playing while unsupervised, on this day, she evidently crossed the road to a meadow close to her home to gather buttercups and daisies.

According to Straffen&#x27;s later statement to the police, he initially observed Brenda as she gathered flowers in this meadow and the child &quot;looked up and smiled&quot; at him before he asked her, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; to which Brenda replied &quot;Picking flowers&quot; before extending her arm to display a &quot;bunch of white flowers&quot; as she continued to smile. After learning Brenda&#x27;s name, Straffen stated: &quot;I know a place where there are even more flowers; they&#x27;re in that wood. Shall I show you?&quot; Brenda eagerly agreed.

At the entrance to a nearby copse, Brenda allowed Straffen to lift her over a fence. Almost immediately thereafter, Straffen manually strangled the child although as he was both confused and frustrated that Brenda did not attempt to scream prior to lapsing into unconsciousness, he then repeatedly struck her head against a large stone. Straffen did not make any attempt to hide the body and simply continued to the cinema to watch the film &quot;Shockproof&quot;, after which he returned home.

Brenda&#x27;s foster mother reported her missing at 3:15 p.m.; her body was discovered by a police officer at 7:10 p.m. The location of her body was just three hundred yards from her home. No effort had been made to conceal her body, and numerous clipped white convolvulus flowers were found at the crime scene. The child had not been sexually assaulted, and investigators were unable to determine the actual motive for the crime.

After eliminating Brenda&#x27;s biological and foster family as suspects, police began questioning all locals with criminal records. Straffen was questioned by Bath City Police in relation to Brenda&#x27;s murder on 3 August. He admitted to having worn a navy blue suit on the date of the child&#x27;s death and that he may have been the individual in such attire seen by Brenda&#x27;s foster mother walking past her home shortly before she had noticed Brenda missing from her front garden, but he denied any involvement in the murder. As police had no physical evidence linking Straffen to Brenda&#x27;s murder, they were unable to charge him with the crime.

====Employment dismissal====
Prior to Straffen&#x27;s formal interview regarding Brenda&#x27;s murder, police had also contacted his employer to verify his movements on the date of her death; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July. Although Straffen blamed the police for his dismissal, his employer would later state he had already been planning to &quot;lay [Straffen] off&quot; within days of his own interview with the police due to Straffen&#x27;s recent lack of commitment to his work duties and his bizarre habit of hoarding flowers and vegetables in locations he apparently believed they would not be found.

In a later interview given to a prison psychiatrist, Straffen confirmed that although he was not charged with Brenda&#x27;s murder, he had known he remained under suspicion following his interview and resolved to continue to antagonise the police, with his dismissal likely furthering this desire.
===Cicely Batstone===
On 8 August, Straffen encountered 9-year-old Cicely Dorothy Batstone at the Forum Cinema in Bath as the two watched &quot;Tarzan and the Jungle Queen&quot;. He offered the child a sweet and the two engaged in conversation, with Cicely informing Straffen her mother had allowed her to travel to the cinema alone as it was &quot;children&#x27;s day&quot;—although she was unsure of the exact meaning of this term. In response, Straffen replied the term likely meant children could do as they pleased for the entire day.

Upon the film&#x27;s conclusion, Straffen offered to accompany Cicely to another local cinema to watch the Western &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; with the added promise of paying her admission fee. Cicely agreed, and the two travelled via bus across town. Shortly after alighting the bus, the two were observed walking along Bloomfield Road in the direction of the meadow at approximately 8 p.m. by a woman named Violet Cowley. Cowley—the wife of a policeman—would later state the sight of the two had made her feel &quot;uneasy&quot;.

Shortly after entering a meadow known locally as &quot;The Tumps&quot;, Cicely was manually strangled to death. Straffen then walked home, purchasing fish and chips en route.

===Missing person report===
Cicely&#x27;s parents had been socialising with friends on the afternoon of 8 August upon the understanding her 16-year-old sister, Gladys, would be at the family home at a prearranged time to supervise her sister when she returned from the cinema; however, when Cicely failed to return home, Gladys initially assumed she was with their parents. As such, the child was not reported missing until shortly before 11 p.m. A large-scale manhunt was immediately implemented to locate the child.

Prior to learning of Cicely&#x27;s disappearance, Violet Cowley—mindful of the recent, unsolved murder of Brenda Goddard—had mentioned to her policeman husband having observed a young, dark-haired girl dressed in a grey cardigan and a coloured dress walking in the direction of The Tumps in the company of a blond-haired, slender young man and how the sighting had made her uneasy. Upon learning of Cicely&#x27;s disappearance early the following morning and the manhunt to locate the child, Cowley directed police to the location she had seen the two. Cicely&#x27;s body was discovered beneath a hedge at 8:30 a.m.

===Eyewitness statements===
In addition to Violet Cowley, numerous other eyewitnesses had observed Straffen in Cicely&#x27;s company prior to her murder. These individuals included the driver of the bus Cicely had boarded, who informed investigators on the morning of 9 August the child had been in the company of a young, blond-haired man, the bus conductor—who also recognised Straffen as a former colleague—and a courting couple walking through The Tumps who observed the &quot;laughing child&quot; in the company of an individual matching Straffen&#x27;s description.

==Arrest==

Police drove to Straffen&#x27;s home to question him in relation to Cicely&#x27;s murder on the morning of 9 August. According to investigators, when informed of the purpose of their visit, Straffen replied: &quot;Is it about the girl I was at the pictures with last night?&quot; He was then driven to the Old Police Station to face formal questioning.

===Confession===
Straffen readily admitted to investigators he had been in Cicely&#x27;s company on the afternoon of her murder; however, he initially denied any culpability in her death—insisting the child had been asleep in The Tumps when he last saw her. Shortly thereafter, he revised this statement to admit he knew Cicely was deceased, stating: &quot;She is dead, but you can&#x27;t prove I did it because no-one saw me.&quot; He also willingly confessed to the murder of Brenda Goddard, stating: &quot;The other girl, I did her the same.&quot; When questioned as to why he had killed the children, Straffen stated he had committed both murders to give the police &quot;something to really do&quot; as opposed to continually pursuing him for relatively trivial offences. He was formally charged with the murder of Cicely Batstone the following day.

===Formal charges===
Straffen formally appeared at the Guildhall in Bath on 24 August 1951, charged with both child murders; he pleaded not guilty to the charges on this date and was remanded in custody until 30 August. On 31 August, after a two-day hearing at Bath Magistrates&#x27; Court, a formal date was set for Straffen to stand trial for the murder of Cicely Batstone.

==First murder trial==
Straffen stood trial at Taunton Assize Court on 17 October 1951. He was tried before Mr Justice Oliver.

The only witness to testify at this eight-minute hearing was the medical superintendent at HM Prison Horfield, Peter Parkes, who testified to having reviewed Straffen on numerous occasions between 1947 and 1951 and that his current level of mental deficiency remained &quot;very much the same&quot; as it had in 1947. Parkes also testified as to Straffen&#x27;s inability to appreciate or understand the circumstances and procedures of the legal process.

Following Parkes&#x27; testimony, Judge Oliver instructed the jury: &quot;In this country we do not try people who are insane. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried.&quot; As such, the jury formally ruled that Straffen was insane and unfit to plead. He was ordered to be detained at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure at Broadmoor Hospital (then known as Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane) in Crowthorne, Berkshire.
===Committal to Broadmoor===
Constructed in the 19th century, Broadmoor Hospital had originally been termed a criminal lunatic asylum; however, the Criminal Justice Act 1948 transferred all responsibility for the institution to the Ministry of Health, and those committed to the facility had been reclassified from &quot;inmates&quot; to &quot;patients&quot; by the time of Straffen&#x27;s committal. As such, all patients within the facility were subjected to a more humane regime. Shortly after arriving at this 40-acre institution, Straffen was assigned work as a cleaner.

===Escape===
At 2:25 p.m. on 29 April 1952, Straffen—wearing his own civilian clothing beneath his assigned work uniform—managed to surmount Broadmoor&#x27;s wall by climbing onto the slate roof of a lean-to shed with the assistance of large disinfectant drums placed against the wall of the institution during an assigned work detail to clean a dilapidated outbuilding. He was briefly unsupervised at the time of climbing onto the slate roof after the sole guard assigned to supervise his work detail left him unattended as he oversaw the cleaning work of other inmates. Straffen then scaled the remaining eighteen inches to the top of the perimeter wall and lowered himself to the ground. His escape was quickly noticed, and local police notified. A manhunt to re-apprehend Straffen was immediately implemented.
==Murder of Linda Bowyer==
Upon escaping from Broadmoor, Straffen is known to have discarded his work uniform before travelling approximately over the course of two hours on foot before arriving in the village of Farley Hill where, according to eyewitnesses, he began loitering without apparent purpose.

At approximately 5:30p.m., a resident glanced from a cottage window to observe Straffen sitting on a bench watching five-year-old Linda Bowyer randomly riding her new bicycle around the village. The final reliable eyewitness sighting of the child alive occurred at approximately 5:50p.m. Shortly thereafter, Linda Bowyer was lured to a nearby field and manually strangled to death before Straffen walked to a nearby household to ask the occupant, a Mrs. Loyalty Kenyon, for a glass of water and directions to Wokingham. Shortly thereafter, Straffen thumbed a lift from a female motorist, requesting she drive him to the Bramshill Hunt bus stop.

As the motorist approached the bus stop, Straffen observed several men standing close to the bus stop, causing him to nervously remark: &quot;Is that the police? What are they doing?&quot; He then alighted the vehicle and walked briskly in the direction of a nearby pub as the motorist spoke to the men, whom she learned were Broadmoor staff members and policemen. Straffen was observed talking to several young children in a lane some 150 yards behind the pub minutes later; he was arrested in a field at 6:40p.m. following a brief chase and struggle.

===Body discovery===
Linda&#x27;s mother first noticed her daughter&#x27;s disappearance at 7:30p.m. when the child failed to return home or respond to her subsequent calling her name aloud from her garden gate. With the assistance of soldiers stationed at Arborfield military camp, police immediately implemented a manhunt to locate the child, and Linda&#x27;s fully clothed, strangled body was found beneath an oak tree within a bluebell copse by Sergeant Percy Axford at 5:25 the following morning. An autopsy revealed the child had been deceased for between twelve and fifteen hours, and that she had not been sexually assaulted.

Investigators immediately travelled to Broadmoor to question Straffen as to whether he had committed any further crimes while he had escaped from the institution. When awoken and politely asked by Chief Inspector Frederick Francis whether he had committed &quot;any mischief&quot; the previous day, Straffen simply replied, &quot;I did not kill her&quot; before elaborating: &quot;I know you coppers! I know I killed [Goddard and Batstone], but I did not kill the little girl on the bicycle.&quot;

News of Straffen&#x27;s escape and the fact he had committed a third child murder prior to his recapture sparked intense public outrage, with security within the facility subject to particular scrutiny. According to contemporary press reports, Straffen later claimed before court officials his escape had been to prove he &quot;could be out without killing little children.&quot;
===Further murder charge===
On 1 May 1952, investigators successfully applied for a warrant to formally charge Straffen with the murder of Linda Bowyer. He appeared at Reading Magistrates&#x27; Court the following day to be notified of this formal murder charge and was detained in the hospital wing of HM Prison Brixton to await trial for her murder.

Within months of Straffen&#x27;s recapture, security measures at Broadmoor had sufficiently increased to resemble those within a Category A prison. His escape and further murder also inspired the implementation of the activation of a system of warning sirens around Broadmoor to alert staff and the public alike upon the event of an inmate&#x27;s escape from the facility, with the sirens tested on a weekly basis.

==Second murder trial==
Straffen was brought to trial at Winchester Assizes for the murder of Linda Bowyer on 21 July 1952. He was tried before Mr. Justice Cassels. The prosecution was led by Solicitor-General Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller. Straffen was defended by Henry Elam.

Upon advice from his defence counsel, Straffen pleaded not guilty to the charge and on the trial&#x27;s opening date, his defense lawyer informed jurors his client would not testify on his own behalf as he was mentally defective, stating: &quot;A person found unfit to plead cannot make a proper defence and cannot follow the details of the evidence.&quot; The defence also opted to leave the question of his sanity as an issue to be determined by the jury.

At the request of the prosecution, Mr. Justice Cassels ruled in the trial&#x27;s opening stages that evidence pertaining to Straffen&#x27;s two prior murders would be admissible as similar fact evidence, and the lack of any obvious motive for Linda&#x27;s murder (as had been the case with Brenda Goddard and Cicely Batstone), the ages of the three children, the fact that none of the crime scenes bore any evidence of a physical struggle between the child and her murderer, and the fact no effort had been made to conceal any of the children&#x27;s bodies was discussed at trial by the prosecution and witnesses to testify on their behalf.
===Witness testimony===
The prosecution contention was that Straffen had been the individual who had murdered Linda in the fours hours he had remained at liberty prior to his recapture, with Manningham-Buller informing the jurors police had been able to account for Straffen&#x27;s movements throughout the entire duration of his liberty via eyewitness testimony and the known duration of his movements save for the &quot;vital twenty minutes&quot; between which the child had last been seen alive riding her bicycle within Farley Hill and prior to Straffen knocking on Mrs. Kenyon&#x27;s door to ask for a glass of water. Manningham-Buller further informed the jury a reconstruction of the movements from where Straffen had been observed sitting and watching Linda ride her bicycle to the copse where her body was discovered revealed the route would have taken him approximately six minutes and thirty seconds to walk.

On 23 July, the pathologist who had performed the autopsy on Linda Bowyer, Dr Robert Donald Teare, testified that the pressure applied to the child&#x27;s neck had been &quot;determined and applied at exactly the right points, as if by a person experienced in this method of killing&quot;. Teare further testified that, having studied post-mortem photographs and the autopsy reports of the two children Straffen had confessed to murdering in Bath, he had noted &quot;many similarities&quot; in the method of strangulation applied to Brenda and Cicely that had been applied to Linda.

Straffen&#x27;s defence called several individuals who had previously evaluated their client to give evidence about his mental condition in addition to a woman and her son who had heard the scream of a young girl emanating from the direction of the copse where Linda&#x27;s body was discovered at approximately 6:45p.m. on the date of her disappearance—thus suggesting the child had been murdered after Straffen had been re-apprehended.

In rebuttal to the defence&#x27;s arguments regarding Straffen&#x27;s limited intellect and inability to differentiate right from wrong, Manningham-Buller called several Broadmoor prison medical officers and psychiatrists to testify as to their treatment methods prior to Straffen&#x27;s escape from the facility improving his knowledge and IQ to the extent he knew the difference between right and wrong, and was able to understand the basic principles pertaining to the consequential legal process as a result of his actions. One of these individuals, Dr Thomas Munro—an expert in the treatment of mental deficiency—testified that Straffen had informed him that to commit the act of murder was wrong both because it broke the rule of law and because the act was &quot;one of the commandments&quot;.

==Conviction==
Straffen&#x27;s second murder trial lasted four days. Upon completion of both counsels&#x27; closing arguments, Mr. Justice Cassels delivered his final instructions to the jury, in which he emphasised: &quot;If you are satisfied that the prisoner killed Linda Bowyer, then the [insanity] issue raised by the defence calls for your consideration. To establish a defence of insanity it must be clearly proved that the prisoner at the time of committing the act was labouring under such a defect of reason of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was [committing], or that he did not know it was wrong according to law ... He has been certified as a mental defective and when you look at all the medical evidence on both sides, no witness has said that, even within the meaning of medicine, this man is insane.&quot;

The jury deliberated for just twenty-nine minutes before announcing they had reached a verdict of guilty. Consequently, Mr. Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to death, informing him his crime &quot;was a cruel and brutal act you committed knowingly on that girl.&quot; Straffen displayed no emotion upon hearing the sentence passed, although his mother had to be escorted from the courtroom by her elder son Roy as she exclaimed, &quot;He didn&#x27;t do it!&quot; The mothers of all three of Straffen&#x27;s victims were present within the courtroom to hear the judge sentence Straffen to death.

===Appeal and reprieve===
Straffen appealed his conviction, contending his trial judge had prejudiced the jury by allowing into admission the evidence of his two previous murders as similar fact evidence, and that his verbal statements to investigators on the morning after the Linda&#x27;s murder were also wrongly admitted because they had been made before he was formally cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed on 26 August, and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. His execution date was fixed for 4 September; however, this sentence was commuted to one of life imprisonment by Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe on 29 August, following his personal recommendation to the Queen that Straffen be reprieved.

==Imprisonment==
Following his reprieve, Straffen was moved from Broadmoor to HM Prison Wandsworth. Four years later, in 1956, he was transferred back to HM Prison Horfield after staff uncovered an impending escape attempt by prisoners—including Straffen—to escape from the facility, with Straffen&#x27;s fellow conspirators in this plot reportedly choosing to initially take Straffen with them to divert primary police and public focus away from themselves. The news of Straffen&#x27;s return to a Bristol prison caused intense public outrage in the city, and a petition demanding his transferral from the prison was signed by over 12,000 people, although this petition was unsuccessful. While incarcerated at HM Prison Horfield, Straffen reportedly enquired to the governor each month whether a formal date had been set for his release.

In August 1958, Straffen was transferred to HM Prison Cardiff when the security regime at HM Prison Horfield was adjusted to a less severe level. This transferral was relatively brief and by June 1960, he had been transferred back to a maximum security block within HM Prison Horfield.

Following the completion of the construction of a 28-cell high-security wing at HM Prison Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight in early 1966, Straffen was secretly transferred to this facility on 31 January of that year. Two years later, in May 1968, Straffen was transferred to HM Prison Durham, where he was incarcerated in a high-security section of the prison. Here, he was observed to be taciturn, aloof, and hostile—&quot;circling, banging the fence every couple of minutes&quot; and seldom talking &quot;unless he has to ask for something. Always on his own.&quot;

===Legal barriers===
For the first five decades of Straffen&#x27;s incarceration, the Home Secretary held the power of discretion to overrule any recommendations or decisions made to release any prisoner serving a life sentence either recommended for parole, or who had served the minimum term imposed at trial. Successive individuals appointed to this position refused to consider Straffen for release. A list of twenty prisoners serving life sentences who would never be released from custody compiled by then-Home Secretary Michael Howard in 1994 included Straffen&#x27;s name; this list was later published by the &quot;News of the World&quot; in December 1997.

In 2001, Straffen&#x27;s solicitors formally requested his case be reopened on the grounds that he had never been fit to stand trial as a sane individual. This development was announced shortly after investigative journalist Robert Woffinden, having examined records previously undisclosed to the public, had discovered that Straffen&#x27;s death sentence had actually been reprieved by David Maxwell Fyfe due to the fact the majority of the doctors who had examined Straffen prior to his second trial had actually declared that he was insane. Woffinden also questioned Straffen&#x27;s guilt in the murder of Linda Bowyer because at the time of his arrest, he had bitten his fingernails to the hilt, whereas distinctive fingernail marks were discovered on the child&#x27;s neck in addition to the fact two local witnesses had placed the approximate time of her murder after Straffen&#x27;s recapture.

Straffen&#x27;s application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his conviction reviewed was turned down in December 2002.
===Later developments===
In May 2002, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) began ruling upon decisions made in cases brought by prisoners serving a term of life imprisonment who challenged the authority of the Home Secretary to refuse to release them after the parole board had recommended they be freed. The ECtHR ultimately decided that politicians should not decide the minimum terms of imprisonment for prisoners serving life sentences and that as such, the current practice of Home Secretaries overruling parole board decisions was unlawful. At the time of these developments, Straffen was incarcerated at HM Prison Long Lartin.

==Death==
John Straffen died of natural causes within the health care centre of HM Prison Frankland following a brief illness on the morning of 19 November 2007. At the time of Straffen&#x27;s death, he was 77 years old and had been incarcerated for 55 years, 3 months, and 26 days and was the longest-serving prisoner in British criminal history.

Despite ample circumstantial evidence attesting to his guilt in the murder of Linda Bowyer, Straffen always denied any culpability in her death, although he openly admitted to having murdered Brenda Goddard and Cicely Batstone.

Three days after Straffen&#x27;s death, &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist and investigative journalist Robert Woffinden penned an obituary article in which he opined that Straffen would be remembered by many within the United Kingdom as &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most notorious child murderers&quot;.

<doc id="1144862" wikidata="Q4953900" url="?curid=1144862" title="Brad Duguid">
<text>Brad Duguid (born July 9, 1962) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the riding of Scarborough Centre in Toronto. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne.

==Background==
Duguid was born in Scarborough and graduated from Woburn Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto.

Before seeking elected office, Duguid worked in government services at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, serving as executive assistant to Metro Councillor Scott Cavalier, Ontario MPP Frank Faubert, and Liberal Members of Parliament Catherine Callbeck and Derek Lee.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
In 1994, he was elected as a city councillor in the suburban municipality of Scarborough. In the elections of 1997 and 2000, he was elected as a councillor in the amalgamated &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto. During his time in municipal government, Duguid was known for his work on community safety issues and affordable housing. He drafted a crime-prevention strategy for Toronto in 1999, and was a founder of the &quot;Scarborough Community Safety Council&quot;, the &quot;Scarborough Community Safety Audit Program&quot; and the &quot;Business Crime Prevention Seminar Program&quot;. He was also known as a supporter of then-Mayor of Toronto, Mel Lastman. In the 2003 election, Duguid supported John Tory over David Miller for Mayor of Toronto.

===Provincial===
On May 1, 2003, Duguid was appointed by Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty as the party&#x27;s candidate for Scarborough Centre in the upcoming provincial election. This upset many in the local party association, as 1999 Ontario general election candidate Costas Manios was widely expected to win the nomination again. Manios decided to run against Duguid as an Independent (essentially campaigning as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot;), and many believed he would deny Duguid victory by splitting the Liberal vote. Instead, the provincial trend overrode local factors—Duguid defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Marilyn Mushinski by over 10,000 votes, while Manios finished fourth, behind Michael Laxer of the Ontario New Democratic Party.

On October 23, 2003, Duguid was appointed Parliamentary Assistant on urban issues to John Gerretsen, the Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. As such, he has often clashed with Mayor David Miller over allegations by the mayor that the province has reneged on funding promises to the city.

Following his re-election in 2007, Duguid was appointed Minister of Labour. He ensured job protection for military reservists and improved health and safety in the workplace. He also saw the creation of the new Family Day holiday, allowing Ontario families to spend quality time together.

In a Cabinet shuffle on September 18, 2008, Duguid was appointed as the province&#x27;s Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. As Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 2008 to 2010, Duguid worked at building relationships through agreements with a number of First Nations and Métis organizations, including the framework to transfer Ipperwash Park to the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation. Uniting two of his passions – youth outreach and hockey – Duguid also brought PLAY to First Nations&#x27; youth, a project that provides hockey coaching, mentoring and, potentially, facilities to Aboriginal communities in the north. On January 18, 2010 he was appointed Minister of Energy and Infrastructure.

In the re-election and subsequent Cabinet shuffle, in October 2011, the Cabinet was dissolved, and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure was split into two Ministries. The resulting cabinet Duguid was appointed as the Minister of Energy.

In the Cabinet, post election, on October 20, 2011, Brad Duguid was appointed Minister of Economic Development and Innovation.

In December 2012, CTV London reported that some of Minister Duguid&#x27;s Christmas cards were sent without postage, instead using franking stickers only available to the monarch, federal MPs, senators and certain parliamentary employees. A staffer later resigned over the controversy.

After Kathleen Wynne took over in 2013, she appointed Duguid as the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. Duguid was re-elected in the June 2014 election. After the election he was appointed as the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure.
 On June 13, 2016, Duguid&#x27;s portfolio was changed to Minister of Economic Development and Growth.

In September 2017, Duguid announced he would not be running for re-election in the next 2018 Ontario general election. His constituency was won by the Progressive Conservative candidate, Christina Mitas.

<text>NetNewsWire is a free and open-source RSS reader for macOS and iOS, originally developed by Brent and Sheila Simmons through Ranchero Software. It was first introduced on in 2002 as &quot;NetNewsWire Lite&quot;, a free version with fewer features compared to the commercial release. Ownership transitioned over time, with NewsGator acquiring it in 2005 and Black Pixel in 2011, before Brent Simmons regained the intellectual property in 2018 and released his open source Mac RSS reader, &quot;Evergreen&quot; as NetNewsWire 5.0d1. NetNewsWire has been well received by the community, receiving awards such as Macworld&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Choice.

==History==
NetNewsWire was developed by Brent and Sheila Simmons for their company Ranchero Software. It was introduced on July 12, 2002, with &quot;NetNewsWire Lite&quot;, a free version missing some advanced features of the (then commercial) version, introduced some weeks later. Version 1.0 was released on February 11, 2003, and version 2.0 was released in May 2005. At that time it included custom feed views, custom downloading and opening of podcasts, synchronization of feeds and feed status between computers, Bloglines support, and a built-in tabbed browser.

In October 2005, NewsGator bought NetNewsWire, bringing their NewsGator Online RSS synchronization service to the Mac. Brent Simmons was hired by NewsGator to continue developing the software.

NetNewsWire 3.0 was released on June 5, 2007. The version added Spotlight indexing of news items, integration with iCal, iPhoto, Address Book, and VoodooPad, Growl support, a new user interface, performance enhancements, and more.

The application was originally shareware, but became free with the release of NetNewsWire 3.1 on January 10, 2008. NetNewsWire Lite was discontinued at the same time. NetNewsWire 3.2 moved to an advertisement-supported model with the option to purchase the application to remove ads.

An iOS version of NetNewsWire with support for the iPhone, iPod Touch and later for the iPad was released on the first day of the App Store. It included syncing of unread articles with the desktop version.

NetNewsWire Lite 4.0 was introduced on March 3, 2011, on the Mac App Store. While it misses several of the advanced features included in NetNewsWire 3.2, it includes a completely rewritten codebase which was used in the iOS version of the app and for NetNewsWire 4.0 which was released as shareware.

On June 3, 2011, the acquisition of NetNewsWire by Black Pixel was announced. For two years development had been apparently stalled, with a gap in updates from 2011 through the release of the version 4 Open Beta.

On June 24, 2013, NetNewsWire 4.0 was announced and released as an open beta by Black Pixel. This announcement also brought news that the product would be a commercial product with no free component (though the beta would be free to use through the final release).

The final release of NetNewsWire 4.0 occurred on September 3, 2015.

In 2017 support of JSON Feed was added into the code base.

On August 31, 2018, Black Pixel announced that they had returned the NetNewsWire intellectual property to Brent Simmons.

On September 1, 2018, Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire 5.0d1. It was a renamed version of his open source Mac RSS reader, &quot;Evergreen&quot;. Almost a year later, NetNewsWire 5.0 was released on August 26, 2019 as an open source application.

On December 22, 2019, Brent Simmons started a public beta for the NetNewsWire iOS app which was distributed through TestFlight. The iOS version of NetNewsWire 5.0 was released March 9, 2020.

On March 27, 2021, Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire 6.0 for macOS along with a public beta for iOS which, again, was distributed through TestFlight.

On June 22, 2021, Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire 6.0 for iOS.

==Reception==
NetNewsWire has been well regarded by many users and reviewers. According to FeedBurner, NetNewsWire was the most popular desktop newsreader on all platforms in 2005. The software received a &quot;Macworld&quot; Editor&#x27;s Choice Award in 2003 and 2005 and maintained a 4.8 out of five stars rating among reviewers at VersionTracker (now CNET). &quot;Ars Technica&quot; called NetNewsWire&#x27;s built-in browser &quot;hands-down the best of any Mac newsreader,&quot; and Walter Mossberg, technology columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, said that NetNewsWire is his favorite for the Mac.

NetNewsWire 5.0 was also received well. MacStories praised the RSS reader&#x27;s search engine and general stability, but lamented that some advanced features and customization options had not made it into the release, calling 5.0 &quot;a solid foundation for the future&quot;. Gizmodo wrote that NetNewsWire 5.0 was off to a promising start, but agreed that it lacked some of the features that might be expected by a power user.

<doc id="1144876" wikidata="Q2581459" url="?curid=1144876" title="Willie Johnson (guitarist)">
<text>Willie Johnson (March 4, 1923 – February 26, 1995) was an American electric blues guitarist. He is best known as the principal guitarist in Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s band from 1948 to 1953. His raucous, distorted guitar playing is prominent on Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s Memphis recordings during 1951–1953, including the hit song &quot;How Many More Years&quot; (recorded May 1951).

In 2017, Johnson was posthumously inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
Willie Lee Johnson was born in Senatobia, Mississippi. As the guitarist in the first band led by Howlin&#x27; Wolf, he appeared on most of Wolf&#x27;s recordings between 1951 and 1953. He provided the slightly jazzy yet raucous guitar sound that was the signature of all of Wolf&#x27;s Memphis recordings. Johnson also performed and recorded with other blues artists in the Memphis area, including pianist Willie Love, Willie Nix, Junior Parker, Roscoe Gordon, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland and others.

When Wolf moved to Chicago in around 1953, he could not convince Johnson to join him. Johnson stayed on in Memphis for several years, playing on a number of sessions for Sun Records, including a 1955 collaboration with vocalist Sammy Lewis, &quot;I Feel So Worried&quot;, released under the name Sammy Lewis with Willie Johnson. By the time Johnson relocated to Chicago, Wolf had already hired guitarist Hubert Sumlin as a permanent replacement. James Cotton later recalled that Wolf replaced Johnson because of his heavy drinking.

Johnson occasionally performed and recorded with Howlin&#x27; Wolf after settling in Chicago, and also played briefly in the band of Muddy Waters, as well as a number of other local Chicago blues musicians, including J. T. Brown, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He made his living mainly outside of music for the rest of his life, only occasionally sitting in with the bands of his old friends around Chicago. His final recordings were made for Earwig Music in Chicago in the early 1990s. Johnson died in Chicago on February 26, 1995.

==Namesakes==
Willie Johnson the guitarist should not be confused with Willie Johnson (a member of the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet until joining the Jubilaires in 1948), or with Blind Willie Johnson, an earlier gospel artist.

<text>Melchior Adam (c. 1575 – 26 December 1622) was a German Calvinist literary historian.

==Life==
Adam was born in Grottkau, Nysa, Habsburg Silesia (present-day Grodków, Opole Voivodeship). He visited the college in &quot;Brieg&quot; Brzeg, then studied on various academies with financial support of his benefactor Joachim von Berg. In 1601 he was appointed schoolmaster at the municipal school of Heidelberg, and later became co-rector and professor at the same institution. He died in Heidelberg.

==Works==

His major achievement consists of a collection of literary biographies, which were printed in Stuttgart and Heidelberg in five volumes: &quot;German Philosophers&quot; (including philologists, poets, mathematicians and physicists), &quot;German Theologians&quot;, &quot;Foreign Theologians&quot;, &quot;Jurists and Politicians&quot; and &quot;Medics&quot;. The figures discussed were arranged chronologically by their date of death, most of which lie between 1420 and 1620. His sources were biographical texts, personal records, funeral orations, letters and various academic records.

His 1615 &quot;Vitae Germanorum philosophorum&quot; (Lives of German philosophers) contains one of the earliest biographies of Nicolaus Copernicus.

He discussed Lutheran theologians in a deprecating manner, as he himself was a Calvinist.

<doc id="1144879" wikidata="Q216452" url="?curid=1144879" title="Night of Power">
<text>The Night of Power (; also rendered as the Night of Destiny, Night of Decree, Night of Determination, or the Precious Night), is, in Islamic belief, the night when Muslims believe the Quran was first sent down from heaven to the world, and also the night when its first verses were revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad; it is described as better than a thousand months of worshipping. According to various hadiths, its exact date is uncertain but was one of the odd-numbered nights of the last ten days of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Since that time, Muslims have regarded the last ten nights of Ramadan as being especially blessed. Muslims believe the Night comes again every year, with blessings and mercy of God in abundance. The surah al-Qadr is named after this night, and the purpose of the surah is to describe the greatness of the night. 

== Naming ==
Qadr (قدر), in Arabic, means measure and limit or value of something or destiny. Some reasons have been offered for its naming:

* It is said that it was called al-Qadr because the annual destiny of every person will be determined by God.
* Some say that if one stays awake at this night praying, reading Quran, or repenting, one will reach a high state.
* Some have said that it was called al-Qadr because it is a grand and high-value night.

Other names such as &quot;Laylat al-&#x27;Azama&quot; (Arabic: ليلة العظمة; night of the greatness) and &quot;Laylat al-Sharaf&quot; (Arabic: ليلة الشرف; ) have also been used.

==Revelation to Prophet Muhammad==
Some commentators believe that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad twice; 
*the &#x27;immediate revelation&#x27; happening on the Laylat al-Qadr and 
*&#x27;gradual revelation&#x27; over 23 years.

The Quran uses the word &quot;anzal&quot; () which justifies &#x27;the immediate revelation&#x27;, according to Allamah Tabatabai. Some others believe that the revelation of Quran occurred in two phases, with the first phase being the revelation in its entirety on Laylat al-Qadr to the angel Gabriel (Jibril in Arabic) in the lowest heaven, and then the subsequent verse-by-verse revelation to Muhammad by Gabriel. The revelation started in 610 CE at the Hira cave on Mount Jabal al-Nour in Mecca. The first Surah that was revealed was Sūrat al-ʿAlaq (in Arabic ). During Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation, the first five verses of this Surah, or chapter, were revealed.

Muhammad would usually practice spiritual retreat (Iʿtikāf) during the last ten days of Ramadan, awaiting the Night of Power, fasting and praying throughout the night, and abstaining from sexual relations. He urged his followers to do the same. According to one hadith, Muhammad said: &quot;Whoever stands [in prayer] during the Night of Power out of belief and seeking reward, his previous sins are forgiven.&quot; (Sahih al-Bukhari 1901)

==Date==
A specific date of Laylat al-Qadr is not mentioned in the Quran. Muhammad said God told him the exact date of Laylat al-Qadr in a dream, that he went to tell his companions about that date, and that he saw two people fighting and was caused to forget the date (by God). 

According to the Islamic calendar, an Islamic day begins at &quot;Maghrib&quot; prayer (sunset). The Night of Power extends from Maghrib to &quot;Fajr&quot; prayer (dawn). 

===Sunni Islam===
Sunni Muslims believe that Laylat al-Qadr most likely occurs among the odd-numbered nights of the last ten nights of Ramadan (21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th). Some scholars opine that if a Friday night occurs on an odd numbered night, the night is likely to be Laylat al-Qadr.
=== Shia Islam ===
Shia Muslims similarly believe that Laylat al-Qadr is to be found in the last ten odd-numbered nights of Ramadan but mostly on the 19th, 21st or 23rd of Ramadan with 23rd being the most important night. The 19th, according to the Shia belief, coincides with the night Ali was attacked in the Mihrab while worshipping in the Great Mosque of Kufa. He died on 21 Ramadan.

Shia Muslims say that Ali (the first Shia Imam, and the fourth caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate to Sunnis) had special insight and intimacy with God on this night. Imam Sadiq is quoted as saying (Tafsir &quot;al-Burhan&quot;, vol. 4, p. 487):Once Imam Ali was reciting Surat al-Qadr and his sons, Imam Hasan (a) and Imam Husayn (a) were near him. Imam Husayn (a) asked his father: &quot;Father, how come we feel a different sensation when you recite this surah?&quot; Imam Ali(a) replied, &quot;O son of the Prophet and my son! I know things from this chapter that you are not aware of now. When this surah was sent down to the Prophet he asked me to go to him. When I went to him he recited this surah, then he put his hand on my right shoulder and said: O my brother and my successor! O the leader of my nation after me! O tireless fighter with my enemies! This surah is yours after me, and is for your two sons after you. Gabriel who is my brother among the angels informs me of the events of one year of my nation at the night of Qadr. And after me he will give this information to you. This surah will always have a shining light in your heart and in the heart of your successors until the rising of the dawn of the day of reappearance of Qa&#x27;im [the one who rises, a title for the Islamic Messiah, Mahdi].&quot;Ibn Abbas was aware of both the date and the day of the week. Hence the Shia&#x27;s have generally concluded that it is the 23rd

According to other hadiths, destinies are written on the night of Ramadan 19, are finalized on the night of Ramadan 21, and are ultimately confirmed on the night of Ramadan 23.

Two other possibilities about the time of the Night of Qadr are the nights of Ramadan 27 and Sha&#x27;ban 15.

==Religious importance==
The night is not comparable to any others in view of Muslims and according to a tradition, the blessings due to the acts of worship during this night cannot be equaled even by worshipping throughout an entire lifetime. The reward of acts of worship done in this one single night is more than the reward of a thousand months of worship. 

Surah Al-Qadr of the Quran is about Laylat al-Qadr:

Devout Muslims practice spiritual retreat (Iʿtikāf) during the last ten days of Ramadan, awaiting the Night of Power, fasting and praying throughout the night, and abstaining from sexual relations. Some Muslims practice Iʿtikāf by staying at a mosque throughout the ten days.

== Special prayers (Shi&#x27;a) ==
Shi&#x27;as practice the special prayers (Amaal) of the Night of Qadr every year in mosques, [tekyeh]s, shrines of Imams or children of Imams, Husayniyyas or their own houses. They stay vigilant the whole night until dawn and worship God. The most important practices of the Night of Qadr include congregational prayers, recitation of the Iftitah Supplication, [Abu Hamza al-Thumali] Supplication, and al-Jawshan al-Kabir, and collective supplications while they keep volumes of the Quran on top of their heads. Other rituals of the night include donations of dawn food, payment of their nadhr for the dead, feeding the poor, and emancipation of financial prisoners.

Since the assassination of Ali occurred in the last ten days of the Ramadan month, Shi&#x27;as mourn in these nights.

<doc id="1144884" wikidata="Q7367399" url="?curid=1144884" title="Rosario Marchese">
<text>Rosario Marchese (born January 1, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2014, representing the downtown Toronto riding of Trinity-Spadina and before that the old riding of Fort York.

==Background==
Born in San Nicola da Crissa, Calabria, Marchese arrived in Canada with his family in 1961. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, French and Philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1978, and later received a Bachelor of Education degree. He taught English and French in Toronto and Mississauga. He is also fluent in Italian. As well, he served as Vice-President of the National Congress of Italian Canadians (Toronto), Toronto Public Library Board trustee, and Multilingual Literacy Centre Chair.

==Political life==
In 1980, he ran for school trustee in Ward 4 but finished third behind incumbents Patrick Case and Peter Davis. In 1982 he ran again this time being elected. He ran as a New Democrat aligned trustee.

He served on the Toronto school board from 1982 to 1990. During this period, he was an advocate of lingual and racial rights, worked to establish international language programs, alternative schools and school childcare, and helped to end the practice of streaming students into narrow learning programs.

In 1985 and again in 1988, Marchese voted with other trustees to raise their salaries 35% and 86% respectively. By the end of 1988 salaries had increased from about $18,000 to $44,000. Trustees who supported the increase argued that the salary was too low to attract good candidates. Sheila Cary-Meagher, said, &quot;You have to stop and think... about the people who want to run for the job and who, if we keep it a rich person&#x27;s ghetto, can&#x27;t do it,&quot; she said. In both years trustees rejected citizen recommendations for lower increases.

===Provincial politics===
In 1990, Marchese was elected to the Ontario parliament in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Bob Wong by about 1500 votes in the riding of Fort York.

The NDP won a majority government and Marchese was appointed as the Minister of Culture and Communications on October 1, 1990. One of his first acts as minister was to announce the withdrawal of provincial funds for a proposed opera house in Toronto. Even though the province gave the land to the city for the opera house it was never built. He presided over a significant increase in funding to the Ontario Arts Council and the provincial film industry, but was dropped from cabinet on July 31, 1991. Critics argued that he was dropped from cabinet because he promoted multiculturalism at the expense of some mainstream arts groups.

As a replacement for his cabinet position, Marchese was appointed as parliamentary assistant to Premier Bob Rae focusing on constitutional affairs. In this position he was a proponent of adding a &#x27;social charter&#x27; to the Canadian constitution. This would have promoted equal opportunities, reduce disparities and maintain equalization payments.

In June 1994, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to give Toronto the ability to regulate after hours clubs. The party decided to take over the bill and expanded it to encompass the entire province. It was passed on November 24, 1994.

===Cabinet positions===

===In opposition===
The NDP were defeated in the 1995 election, although Marchese managed to increase his margin of victory against Wong who ran again for the Liberals. In opposition, he managed to distinguish himself as one of the most spirited debaters in the reduced NDP caucus. In the 1999 provincial election he ran in the new riding of Trinity—Spadina and easily won. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007 and 2011. During his tenure in opposition he served as critic for several portfolios and was NDP caucus chair from 2007 to 2014.

In the 2014 provincial election, he was defeated by Liberal candidate Han Dong by 9,175 votes.

<text>Cloak of Deception is a 2001 novel set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy. It is a prequel novel occurring before the events of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. The book was written by James Luceno. The cover art was by Steven Anderson. The book takes place 32.5 years before &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope&quot;.
Narration for the audio version was performed by Alexander Adams. The paperback version included a 15-page excerpt of &quot;Enemy Lines: Rebel Dream&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The Galactic Republic is in a state of decline, mired in greed and corruption and tangled in bureaucracy. In the outlying systems, where the Trade Federation maintains a stranglehold on shipping routes, tensions are boiling over—while back in the comfort of Coruscant, the hub of civilized space and seat of Republic government, few senators seem inclined to investigate the problem. And those who suspect Supreme Chancellor Valorum of having a hand in the machinations are baffled—especially when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi foil an assassination attempt on the Chancellor.

With the crisis escalating, Valorum calls for an emergency trade summit. As humans and aliens gather, conspiracies sealed with large sums of money run rampant, and no one is entirely above suspicion. But the greatest threat of all remains unknown to everyone except three members of the Trade Federation, who have entered into a shadowy alliance with the Sith lord Darth Sidious. While the Federation will be content with more money and fewer problems, Sidious has grander, far more terrifying plans.

==Writing==
While writing the novel, Luceno was granted access to parts of the screenplay drafts and concept art of &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. As such, &quot;Cloak of Deception&quot; marked the first appearance in the series&#x27; chronological timeline of almost all of the new characters from &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, including the Techno Union, and other Separatists.

===Opening crawl===
The back cover of the book features an opening crawl similar to those at the beginning of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films:

<text>WNWO-TV (channel 24) is a television station in Toledo, Ohio, United States, affiliated with NBC. Owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station maintains a transmitter facility on Cousino Road in Jerusalem Township. Its studios are located on South Byrne Road in Toledo.

Channel 24 was the only television station built by entrepreneur Daniel H. Overmyer. It signed on May 2, 1966, as WDHO-TV, Toledo&#x27;s third local station. It had no primary network affiliation until 1969, when it became the area&#x27;s ABC outlet, though it aired shows from the major networks not already seen in the market and was the local affiliate for the short-lived United Network, which Overmyer helped start, in 1967. For most of its first 20 years in operation, the station was burdened by Overmyer&#x27;s other troubled businesses. The sale of his other TV station permits led to a congressional investigation, and Overmyer&#x27;s heavily indebted warehouse interests experienced financial reverses en route to a bankruptcy reorganization filing in 1973. WDHO-TV was involved in two lengthy bankruptcy cases, during which Overmyer committed bankruptcy fraud and the building housing the news department was repossessed by the First National Bank of Boston, which held station stock as collateral. Drained of resources, channel 24 never adequately competed in the area of news, becoming a distant third to the established stations, WTOL and WTVG.

The station was acquired by Toledo Television Investors in 1986 and immediately renamed WNWO-TV. The new owners tried to improve the station&#x27;s news department, but met by viewer indifference and continued low ratings, the station cut back to one newscast a day in 1990. In October 1995, the station switched affiliations from ABC to NBC after WTVG, previously the NBC affiliate in Toledo, was purchased by Capital Cities/ABC. The affiliation switch did not immediately serve as an impetus to revitalize the news operation. That changed after Malrite Communications Group acquired WNWO-TV in 1996 and launched a comprehensive effort including building expansion and expanded newscasts. With the exception of a brief time under Raycom Media ownership, the newscasts failed to attract significant ratings. After Raycom Media acquired WTOL in 2006 and sold WNWO-TV to Barrington Broadcasting, the news department withstood a round of layoffs and gradual decreases in headcount, remaining the laggard in local TV news in spite of a relaunch effort in 2011. Barrington&#x27;s stations were purchased by Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013; shortly after the purchase, Sinclair entered into a seven-month-long retransmission consent dispute with Buckeye CableSystem that saw most Toledo-area cable viewers lose access to WNWO. After the dispute ended, Sinclair attempted another revamp of the news department, to no avail in raising the station&#x27;s flagging ratings fortunes. In March 2017, presentation of its newscasts was outsourced to South Bend, Indiana, and local news was discontinued altogether in May 2023.

==WDHO-TV==
===A third commercial channel for Toledo===
In 1954, at the request of the Detroit-based Woodward Broadcasting Corporation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allotted an additional commercial television channel, ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 79, to Toledo. Woodward obtained a construction permit for a station to use the channel two months later, but it was culled in 1960 as part of a wave of cancellations of unused permits for UHF stations.

Because Toledo only had two commercial allocations in the very high frequency (VHF) band, the city continued to only have two commercial stations. In 1962, FCC chairman Newton Minow told the National Press Club that Toledo was one of several cities that could support a third local commercial station but lacked it in large part because the third allocation was a UHF channel. In February 1963, Springfield Television heeded the call and applied for channel 79. Two months later, Producers, Inc. of Evansville, Indiana, and Daniel H. Overmyer of Toledo made competing applications. Springfield suggested the substitution of a lower channel, 17, and consequent shifts in multiple allotments as distant as Mount Pleasant, Michigan, to make room.

In September 1964, Producers and Springfield Telecasting settled with Overmyer, which reimbursed the two firms a total of $17,200 in expenses incurred in their applications. Now unopposed, Overmyer won an initial decision from an FCC hearing examiner in January 1965. At that time, Overmyer Communications, a new division of Overmyer&#x27;s warehousing operations, began seeking network affiliation and announced its plans to get channel 79 on the air within a year. Later that year, the FCC moved the unbuilt station from channel 79 to channel 24. Overmyer leased office space in Toledo&#x27;s Commodore Perry Hotel.

After delays due to bad weather, WDHO-TV—named for Daniel Harrison Overmyer—began broadcasting on May 2, 1966. The new station had no primary network affiliation and instead aired shows from all three national networks—ABC, CBS, and NBC—that went unaired in Toledo. These were complemented by some syndicated series and a nightly newscast at 11 p.m. When Overmyer sold his other TV station construction permits—all in major markets—to American Viscose Corporation (AVC) in 1967, WDHO-TV was not included in the sale. Another Overmyer project, the Overmyer Network, was sold to a 14-person investor syndicate and renamed the United Network weeks before it launched on May 1, 1967; the unbuilt stations and WDHO were originally to have been network-owned stations, but WDHO was an affiliate for the United Network&#x27;s lone month of existence.

WDHO-TV became an exclusive affiliate of ABC on June 15, 1969, the last network and station to partner after WTOL-TV (channel 11) signed with CBS and WSPD-TV (channel 13) aligned with NBC. While WDHO had local newscasts, a fully-staffed news department was not established until 1972; owing to a lack of space, the news department&#x27;s offices were located in a garage adjacent to their studio building.

=== FCC investigations ===
The sale of Overmyer&#x27;s construction permits to AVC, along with the Overmyer Network, came as the warehouse chain was in the midst of a cash crunch. The lead contractor for the warehouses owed $18 million to shareholders early in 1967, placing that company in financial distress and resulting in liens on multiple unfinished buildings. The warehouse company&#x27;s overhead, particularly with $80,000 in monthly airfare from the financial development team, became equally burdensome. Overmyer agreed to guarantee a debt from the contractor, which restricted company funds even further. Overmyer also sold off both the &quot;Toledo Monitor&quot; and Progress National Bank during this time; both sales were later attributed to this fiscal crisis. The AVC sale was handled as a merger with WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, as AVC created a brand new company in exchange for a $3 million loan to Overmyer; in approving the deal, the FCC waived a proposed rule that limited station group ownership in the top fifty markets.

The FCC&#x27;s deference on the deal resulted in a lengthy investigation by the House Investigations Subcommittee between December 1967 and August 1968. The commissioners, Overmyer, AVC president Dr. Frank H. Reichel, and five FCC staffers were named as witnesses during the second round of hearings, mainly focusing on the FCC&#x27;s overall competence and Overmyer&#x27;s financial qualifications. The Subcommittee&#x27;s report admonished the FCC for granting Overmyer the construction permits in the first place, suggesting that he failed to supply needed financial information and paperwork and violated the FCC&#x27;s out-of-pocket expense policy by effectively disguising a $3 million stock payment as a loan. This prompted the FCC to conduct a hearing on the AVC sale to determine if fraud had been committed and to defer WDHO&#x27;s license renewal.

Administrative law judge Herbert Sharfman, in his initial decision on April 20, 1973, found Overmyer had overstated his total out-of-pocket expenses by $227,000 but ruled there was no direct evidence of maliciousness or fraud. AVC had already sold off the stations purchased from Overmyer after taking almost all of them dark. WXIX-TV in Cincinnati, which was also sold, was the only AVC station to remain on-air continuously. Due to this and Overmyer having paid off the loan in full, the ruling only affected the deferred renewal of WDHO&#x27;s license. The Broadcast Bureau disagreed with Sharfman&#x27;s ruling, regarding the financial misrepresentation as a possible character qualification issue as Overmyer still owned WDHO; the FCC review board remanded the case in January 1974 by Overmyer&#x27;s request, sending it back to Sharfman. Overmyer was cleared by judge Sharfman of the misrepresentation charges in his May 13, 1974, supplemental initial decision, stating there was &quot;a complete failure of the record to inculpate Mr. Overmyer personally, directly or by implication&quot;. The FCC Review Board affirmed Sharfman&#x27;s ruling on August 21, 1975.

=== Bankruptcy and seizure by FNBB ===
In 1971, Overmyer pledged the stock of the subsidiary that held WDHO-TV&#x27;s license to the First National Bank of Boston (FNBB) as security for a $6 million loan. This and other tactics by Overmyer failed to stabilize his financial position, and he held more than $25 million in debt by 1973. Overmyer&#x27;s warehouse companies entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on November 29, 1973. FNBB then sued Overmyer on May 7, 1974; it sought control of 249 shares in WDHO-TV stock, claiming to hold all 500 shares as collateral for the now-defaulted loans that totaled $10.5 million. Overmyer countersued for $200 million, claiming he was forced into insolvency by FNBB. WDHO-TV filed for bankruptcy in January 1976 when FNBB set up an auction for the station&#x27;s assets, with the station placed under a debtor in possession arrangement. During this time, the news department operated out of a leased double-wide trailer parked next to the studio building, which continued for three years (from 1977 to 1980). It was stated at the time the trailer&#x27;s use was discontinued and that it was a station decision to end the lease, but later accounts indicated that FNBB repossessed or nearly repossessed the trailer.

The first bankruptcy proceeding for WDHO was dismissed in 1980. On February 6, 1981, the SDNY denied an appeal by Overmyer; WDHO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again, this time in Cleveland, Ohio. FNBB was awarded control of WDHO on March 25, 1981, by the Cleveland court, despite Overmyer&#x27;s objection that the order violated FCC rules on ownership transfers for licenses. Overmyer was indebted by as much as $22.4 million to FNBB, which regarded the takeover as proper. Prior to the second bankruptcy, WDHO&#x27;s license was renewed by the FCC after ten years of deferrals; the commission rejected a request by the Broadcast Bureau to review the 1975 Review Board report, noting the antiquity of the AVC sale controversy and Overmyer&#x27;s status as an &quot;inactive station owner&quot;. WDHO staffers reportedly cheered after learning of the takeover by FNBB, as their paychecks under Overmyer often bounced.

Cleveland bankruptcy court judge John Ray, Jr., ruled against Overmyer on September 24, 1982, determining that he and an associate, attorney Edmund M. Connery, engaged in fraud against FNBB. Hadar Leasing Company, an Overmyer subsidiary, purchased broadcast equipment for WDHO and leased it back to the station (and, in effect, FNBB) at falsified rates that benefited Overmyer; leases included spare parts and roof repairs. Hadar also filed a proof of claim of $859,481.80 during the WDHO bankruptcy that was also found to be fraudulent. WDHO staff also agreed to payroll deductions to benefit the United Way in 1980 and 1981, but the money collected was never donated until after FNBB took over. Comparing the fraud to Twyne&#x27;s Case of 1601, Judge Ray ordered a constructive trust to dispose of all assets belonging to Overmyer, including WDHO, and FNBB seized outright control of the station. FNBB also seized control of a subsidiary nominally in Overmyer&#x27;s daughters&#x27; name that was applying to construct a new television station in Yuma, Arizona. The bank immediately desired to sell WDHO-TV.

== WNWO-TV ==
=== Sale and relaunch ===
FNBB sold WDHO to Toledo Television Investors, Ltd. (TTI) for $19.6 million in June 1985. TTI was owned by I. Martin Pompadur and Ralph Becker, both of New York. Becker and Pompadur had previously teamed to start Television Station Partners, which was formed from the management buyout of Ziff-Davis Broadcasting in 1982. The sale coincided with the SDNY auctioning Overmyer&#x27;s other assets, including the warehouse adjacent to the WDHO studios. While the sale was closing, Overmyer and Connery were indicted on multiple charges of bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud, and mail fraud; Overmyer was eventually convicted on one charge. The new owners changed the station&#x27;s call letters to the current WNWO-TV, for Northwest Ohio, on June 1, 1986, two weeks after the sale closed. While the call sign change was soon followed by cost cuts, layoffs, and the discontinuation of weekend newscasts, TTI also set out to expand the Byrne Road studios and fill out the station&#x27;s numerous management vacancies: the station had no news director or promotions director. Addressing the staff early in 1987, WNWO&#x27;s newly appointed vice president and general manager likened their situation to General Custer, saying &quot;they could attack in any direction&quot;.

In 1990, the station dropped its underperforming 11 p.m. newscast, which garnered a 1% share of the audience—some 4,000 homes. Management opted to broadcast &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, which had been attracting a larger audience at midnight, in its stead. The early news was returned to 5:30 p.m., where it had aired until January 1989, in hopes of attracting a larger audience and based on the station&#x27;s past relative success with the time slot. &quot;Arsenio&quot; was replaced in 1993 with &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;; that year, WNWO-TV joined other ABC affiliates in refusing to air the new network show &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.

=== Affiliation switch to NBC ===
In October 1994, SJL Inc., the owner of WTVG, agreed to sell it and WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan, to Capital Cities/ABC for $155 million. The sale agreement followed rumors that SJL was considering switching WJRT-TV from ABC to NBC, in light of an affiliation switch impending in the Flint market. While the deal kept WJRT-TV with ABC, it signaled an affiliation switch in Toledo, where WTVG had been the NBC affiliate. Even though the sale of WTVG closed in late August 1995, an affiliation switch was set for no later than January 29, 1996—the day after Super Bowl XXX, which was carried by NBC—when ABC sent a six-month affiliation termination notice in late July.

WTVG wanted to switch in November, but channel 24 was not ready; WNWO&#x27;s general manager, Brett Cornwell, sought to have the switch occur on January 1, 1996, but ABC initially rebuffed the deal. The effect of ABC&#x27;s rejection was to uphold the January 29 date, keeping the Super Bowl on WTVG and depriving channel 24 of advertising revenue. In response, in mid-October, Cornwell began preempting low-rated ABC national news shows, including &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;, in favor of local infomercials and car sales programs that brought in revenue for the station. Shortly after, the stations agreed to switch on October 28, 1995, with NBC loaning satellite dishes to help WNWO make the change.

Shortly before the switch, in September 1995, WNWO moved its newscast from 5:30 to 6 p.m.; while this put it up against the main newscasts from WTOL and WTVG, it satisfied NBC&#x27;s desire for a local news lead-in to the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and allowed the station to air the hour-long syndicated talk show &quot;Montel&quot; at 5 p.m. Even with the change in affiliation, WNWO had no plans to reinstate an 11 p.m. newscast, merely renaming the existing dinner-hour news &quot;NBC 24 News&quot;.

=== &quot;Building a better station for you&quot;: Malrite purchase, news expansion, and sale to Raycom ===

In April 1996, Malrite Communications Group announced its purchase of WNWO from Toledo Television Investors. Malrite already owned two network affiliates in Ohio, WXIX-TV (Fox) in Cincinnati and WOIO (CBS) in Cleveland. It saw an opportunity to improve channel 24&#x27;s local programming to match the ratings of the highly popular NBC; company director of planning David Maltz declared immediately that an 11 p.m. newscast would be started once Malrite took control. Once the new owners took control of WNWO, they began a physical and personnel expansion. Former Cleveland television newsman Grant Zalba was hired as WNWO-TV&#x27;s news director, and Malrite broke ground on a expansion of the Byrne Road studios to offer more studio and newsroom space. After an ad campaign declaring &quot;It&#x27;s no secret that this station has been dead last in local news&quot;, the news relaunch debuted on October 16, 1997, with the slogan &quot;Building a Better Station for You&quot;. The improved newscast product included a new meteorologist, new news set and graphics, and WNWO&#x27;s first regular 11 p.m. newscast since 1990. The affiliation switch and revamp failed to meaningfully change the station&#x27;s news ratings. 

Shortly after unveiling the improvements at WNWO, Malrite sold its television stations to Raycom Media in a deal announced in April 1998. The news was a surprise to station staffers and generated considerable uncertainty, particularly as Raycom already owned WUPW (channel 36) and could only keep one of the two stations. Under news director Lou Hebert, who had worked at channel 24 in the late 1970s and returned in 2002, WNWO&#x27;s newscasts made gains among ratings and critics. The station won a regional Emmy Award for best daily newscast, and it narrowed the gap in total viewership with channels 11 and 13. Momentum was soon lost. Raycom mandated a shift to a more tabloid news presentation. After a story on a local Playboy Playmate inadvertently showed a woman&#x27;s breast on the cover of a magazine, Hebert resigned. He was replaced by a news director from Cincinnati who lacked experience in the Toledo area; assignment editor Matt Zaleski later told &quot;The Blade&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s when my reaction was, &#x27;My God, I&#x27;ve got a front-row seat to a train wreck.&#x27;&quot; Ratings fell in two consecutive ratings surveys in 2005, and morale sank.

During Raycom&#x27;s ownership, WNWO introduced a digital signal on February 8, 2001.

=== Barrington Broadcasting ownership ===
In 2006, Raycom acquired the Liberty Corporation, owner of WTOL. Once more, Raycom was forced to divest one of the two stations. It chose to keep WTOL and sold WNWO-TV, along with a variety of stations in conflict markets like Toledo and areas outside of Raycom&#x27;s focus in the Midwest and Southeast, to Barrington Broadcasting. Under Barrington, WNWO continued to sorely underperform; in 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, Barrington conducted a round of layoffs. That same year, the station shut off its analog signal.
The station replaced its existing logo and &quot;NBC 24&quot; brand, used since the 1996 affiliation switch, in 2011 with a blue square containing the letters WNWO. The new logo was paired with cosmetic changes to the news operation. Interim general manager Ben Tucker, who had been brought back to Toledo in an attempt to boost ratings and morale, noted that the station had struggled with extreme turnover. He counted 25 general managers and 30 to 40 news directors over a 30-year period. In 2013, Jim Blue, a veteran Toledo anchorman who had previously worked at channel 24 from 2002 to 2008, returned to anchor WNWO-TV&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast.

=== Sinclair ownership ===
On February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including WNWO-TV, to Sinclair Broadcast Group; the sale was completed on November 25.

Shortly after the sale was completed, Sinclair and Buckeye CableSystem, the dominant cable television provider in Toledo, entered into a retransmission consent dispute. Toledo-area cable subscribers lost WNWO-TV on December 15, 2013, as the two sides could not agree on a per-subscriber rate to reimburse the station. Buckeye claimed Sinclair was seeking an increase from 24 cents per month to $2 a month, which Sinclair denied. Sinclair invoked network non-duplication: this forced the system to black out Detroit NBC affiliate WDIV-TV across its Ohio service territory for the duration of the dispute, which included the 2014 Winter Olympics, aired by NBC. Buckeye distributed 17,000 antennas to customers to receive WNWO-TV&#x27;s broadcast signal. The station was restored on July 14, 2014, ending the dispute after seven months.

During the dispute, Sinclair installed a new management team for WNWO-TV with a new general manager, news director, general sales manager, digital content manager, and promotions director. All five came from WPTA in Fort Wayne, Indiana. After the dispute ended, in August, longtime Toledo news anchor Laura Emerson—who had spent 16 years at WUPW—returned to the market to co-anchor the station&#x27;s evening newscasts. Over the course of 2014, Sinclair added employees, extended the 5 p.m. newscast to an hour, and introduced an 11:30 a.m. newscast.

In spite of these changes, WNWO-TV&#x27;s news offering remained low-rated and was progressively downgraded. Sinclair announced in November 2016 that newscasts for WNWO-TV would be produced by the company&#x27;s WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana; a local news staff of 11 would provide reporting for the programs, while redundant staff were laid off. Sinclair stated that these changes would &quot;improve both the news product and production efficiencies&quot;. When the changes took effect on March 6, 2017, sports was dropped from the newscasts. The evening anchor team was shared with another newscast produced from South Bend for an out-of-market station: Ryan Cummings and Dayne Marae also presented the local news for WOLF-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Weather segments continued to originate in Toledo. Diane Larson, a former WNWO-TV anchor who became a mainstay at WTVG, later said of the change, &quot;[WNWO-TV] suffered from the fact that everyone knew their anchors were no longer in town, even though they had a couple talented people doing local stories. ... The perception was that they were not a local station anymore.&quot;

===End of local newscasts===
On May 12, 2023, Sinclair ended local news programming in five smaller markets, including Toledo, with low-rated newscasts. On May 15, WNWO began airing Sinclair&#x27;s in-house national news program &quot;The National Desk&quot; in the weekday time slots of the canceled local newscasts at 6:30 a.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m.

<text>The Museumsquartier (MQ) is an area of in the 7th district of the city of Vienna, Austria.

== Highlights ==
The Museumsquartier contains Baroque buildings as well as Modern architecture by the architects Laurids and Manfred Ortner (Ortner &amp; Ortner Baukunst). The renovation of the former court stables began in April 1998. Three years later, the Museumsquartier opened in two stages (June and September 2001). The total cost of the construction was 150 Million Euro (two billion Austria Schilling).

The MQ is home to a range of installations from large art museums like the Leopold Museum and the MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) to contemporary exhibition spaces like the Kunsthalle Wien and festivals like the Wiener Festwochen, an annual summer event that is headquartered in the MuseumsQuartier Wien.

Additional highlights include the &quot;Tanzquartier&quot;, an international, state-of-the-art centre for dance, the Architekturzentrum Wien, production studios for new media, artist studios for artists-in-residence, art and cultural facilities designed for children, and a variety of other events and festivals such as the Viennale film festival, the ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival, Coded Cultures, Techno Sensual, and many others.

The Museumsquartier hosts &quot;quartier21&quot;, which features around 60 alternative art groups, for example eSeL.

Since 2002, an artist-in-residence programme brought over 735 artists to MuseumsQuartier, who have been working and living in the studio spaces. The residency programme is run together with &quot;tranzit.org / ERSTE Stiftung,&quot; the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs and the Research Institute for Arts and Technology&quot;.&quot;

The Museumsquartier station of line U2 of the Vienna U-Bahn, as well as the metro station &quot;Volkstheater&quot; is located next to the premises.

== Controversy ==

There was negative media reaction after it became known that the expensive public buildings had serious shortcomings regarding barrier-free wheelchair accessibility. Not even the recently constructed buildings (Kunsthalle, MUMOK and Leopold Museum) were able to fulfill the most basic requirements. After many negative reports across the media, and the commitment of handicapped interest groups, the majority of the problems were repaired in the following years.

Public Netbase, an internet provider and sponsor of electronic art and culture programs, was not invited to be part of Museumsquartier in 2002. Originally located in a part of the MQ, it had to leave during the renovations, but after the construction was completed, it was not able to return to its former premises.

<doc id="1144915" wikidata="Q1523923" url="?curid=1144915" title="Delgo">
<text>Delgo is a 2008 American animated fantasy adventure film directed by Marc F. Adler and Jason Maurer, written by Scott Biear, Patrick J. Cowan, Carl Dream, and Jennifer A. Jones. The film stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, Anne Bancroft, Chris Kattan, Louis Gossett Jr., Burt Reynolds, Eric Idle, Michael Clarke Duncan, Kelly Ripa, Val Kilmer, and Malcolm McDowell with narration by Sally Kellerman. It was the final film for Bancroft and John Vernon, who both died three years before its release, and was dedicated to the former.

The film was distributed by Freestyle Releasing with music by Geoff Zanelli and produced by Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation and Fathom Studios, a division of Macquarium Intelligent Communications, which began development of the project in 1999.

Despite winning the Best Feature award at Anima Mundi, the film was widely panned by critics and audiences, and its box office was one of the lowest-grossing wide releases in recent history. &quot;Delgo&quot; grossed under $1 million in theaters against an estimated budget of $40 million. The film was released independently with a large screen count (over 2,000 screens) and a small marketing budget. As a result, it became a massive box office bomb, losing an estimated $46 million. 20th Century Fox later acquired the film rights for international and domestic home media distribution.

== Plot ==
After having left their own world due to a loss of natural resources, the winged humanoid Nohrin settle on Jhamora with the permission of the ground-dwelling Lokni. Would-be conqueror Sedessa leads those Nohrin that believe in its own racial superiority and try to take land away from the Lokni. The parents of Delgo, a Lokni, are killed in the resulting conflict. Nohrin King Zahn is horrified by the war and admonishes Sedessa, who then poisons the Queen and almost kills Zahn (who catches her) as well. She is subsequently banished, and her wings are clipped off.

Delgo, meanwhile, is raised by Elder Marley, who tries to teach him how to use the power of magical stones. Delgo grows up, and he gives in to his desire for revenge against all Nohrin. He meets Nohrin Princess Kyla and develops a tentative friendship with her. When she is kidnapped by Nohrin General Raius, who is actually working for Sedessa, Delgo and his friend Filo are blamed and arrested.

In the Nohrin prison, Delgo meets Nohrin General Bogardus, who was forced to illegally gamble with his weapons by Raius, because Bogardus opposed an all out war with the Lokni. Delgo, Filo, and Bogardus escape into some caverns and eventually reach Sedessa&#x27;s stronghold and rescue Kyla. They return too late to avert a war taking place. Bogardus fights and defeats Raius, but he is mortally injured.

Just as Bogardus dies from heavy wounds, Delgo realizes that he was the Nohrin soldier who spared his life many years ago during the first war between the Nohrin and the Lokni. Meanwhile, Sedessa&#x27;s army of monsters joins in the battle. Kyla convinces the Nohrin generals to direct their troops to stop fighting the Lokni and instead pick them up and fly them away from the battlefield. Filo then directs an entire stampede of large animals onto the battlefield, sending Sedessa&#x27;s minions fleeing for their lives.

Delgo goes off to face Sedessa and find King Zahn, whom she has taken prisoner. He finally manages to master the stone magic, and defeats Sedessa. He also puts the past behind him by saving her rather than letting her fall to her death. However, Sedessa then attacks Kyla, who has come to Delgo&#x27;s aid. The two struggle and Sedessa finally falls, injuring herself by the fall and her artificial wings being of no use. Later, during the celebrations, it turns out Raius was not dead, and he makes one last attempt to kill Delgo. He is subdued by a Nohrin, but not before he throws his spear at Delgo. Then, out of nowhere, the spear breaks in midair. Everyone turns to look at Filo, who has finally mastered his slingshot. Delgo and Kyla&#x27;s friendship eventually blossoms into romance when they finally kiss.

== Production ==
Fathom Studios began development on &quot;Delgo&quot; in 1999; animation work began in 2001. The movie was produced by Fathom in conjunction with Electric Eye Entertainment Corporation. In a 2001 interview, Marc Adler said that the film sets itself apart from other recent computer-animated films because it is not a comedy and also because it is &quot;a very human story told in a non-human world&quot;. Maurer said that &quot;the inspiration for the story really came from all of the unrest we have in society today, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, violence – all of those terrible things. We wanted to tell a story where our heroes overcame these things personally and facilitated change among entire peoples.&quot; Fathom launched a &quot;Digital Dailies&quot; feature on the movie&#x27;s official website, allowing fans to follow the production as it happened. Animators would post their work daily on the message board system and fans could see the directors&#x27; and producers&#x27; input as well as subsequent changes to the scenes. Chief Animator and Artistic Director Derek Winslow went on record in the January 2001 issue of &quot;US weekly&quot;, stating that &quot;Delgo would be his finest creation&quot; and &quot;would outperform &quot;Shrek&quot; at the box office&quot;. According to Adler, although the original intent of the dailies was to allow the crew to &quot;be able to offer commentary to other staff members who do not work the same hours&quot;, he also said that offering a learning experience to the public was an important reason for their creation. &quot;By granting public access to our film as a work-in-process we are helping to educate students, burgeoning animators, and film enthusiasts about the procedures involved in the making of a computer animated movie.&quot; Adler said that they were &quot;contacted by professors from the many universities who use[d] the Digital Dailies in their classrooms&quot;. The dailies &quot;were receiving a half-million hits a month&quot;, and some of the crew members started to get offers from Hollywood studios (at one point Adler started hiding the identities of the crew with fancy aliases).

Adler recruited main crew members locally from &quot;Savannah College of Art and Design, Georgia Tech and smaller digital outfits&quot;. Students from the drama department of North Atlanta High School acted out some of the scenes to create reference material for the animators. Adler said that their team created eight main characters, at least twenty &quot;secondary characters&quot;, &quot;twenty-two creatures, thirty plants, and fifty-six sets&quot;, as well as numerous background characters. According to Warren Grubb, Fathom&#x27;s head animation director, one of the challenges with modeling the background elements was that &quot;We couldn&#x27;t even use most of the off-the-shelf systems at the time in creating the background assets because they were based on Earthly vegetation.&quot; The filmmakers put together kits with artwork and actual replicas of the stones used in the film to send to the actors, rather than just an offer letter. Once the cast had signed on, the filmmakers had to travel to where the actors were with all their equipment rather than have the actors come to them to record their voices. Anne Bancroft, the voice of villainess Sedessa, died in 2005, before production finished. On the film&#x27;s end credits, the film is dedicated to her. Aside from the death of Bancroft, the film had several other setbacks which delayed its release. John Vernon, the voice of Judge Nohrin, also died in 2005, making this his final film. The directors acknowledge the influence of artist Roger Dean, specifically his album covers for Yes and Asia, on their backgrounds. A partnership with Dell provided Fathom Studios with the hardware required to render &quot;Delgo&quot;.

In 2004, Playmates Toys expressed in an article how excited they were to make &quot;Delgo&quot; merchandise, which included dolls, action figures, play sets, vehicles and toy accessories. Unfortunately, they never followed through.

== Distribution ==
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was originally expected to release the picture, but an executive restructuring altered these plans. In addition, Kevin Foster, the president of Fathom Studios&#x27; parent company Macquarium, died of heart failure during production, causing attention to be drawn away from the film for almost a year. Distributor-for-hire Freestyle Releasing distributed the film to 2,160 theaters in the United States.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Delgo&quot; bombed at the box office and is notable for producing, at the time, the worst opening ever for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. It is one of the lowest-grossing animated films of all time and was pulled from theaters after one week of release. According to Yahoo! Movies, this averages approximately two viewers per screening. In 2012, another Freestyle Releasing film, &quot;The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure&quot;, became the new holder of this record, earning only $443,901 on its opening weekend. &quot;Delgo&quot; is also the lowest-grossing computer-animated film of all time, with just $915,840 made worldwide, a record formerly held by the 2006 film &quot;Doogal&quot; ($7.2 million in the United States).

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 11%, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 3.6/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Delgo&quot; features a blend of plot elements from earlier (and superior) fantasy films, with weaker animation and dull characters.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;generaly unfavourable reviews&quot;.

Leonard Maltin&#x27;s publication &quot;TV Movies&quot; gave the film a &quot;BOMB&quot; rating, calling it &quot;a complete misfire&quot;. Critics from &quot;Newsday&quot; and &quot;Campus Circle&quot; gave the film acclaim, citing a unique look. Tom Keogh of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; praised Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;excellent voice work&quot; and noted the film was a &quot;busy but decent animated fable that feels like a &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; spin-off&quot;.

=== Awards ===
Despite its performance, &quot;Delgo&quot; was accepted by numerous film festivals, including the three largest animation festivals in the world: SICAF (Korea), Annecy (France), and Anima Mundi (Brazil). &quot;Delgo&quot; received the &quot;Best Feature Film&quot; award at 2008&#x27;s Anima Mundi.

== Home media ==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released &quot;Delgo&quot; on DVD on August 4, 2009. A Blu-ray Disc was released on October 5, 2010. The DVD extras include an audio commentary from the directors, featurettes, six deleted scenes, and the short &quot;Chroma Chameleon&quot;.

== Impact ==
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;the failure of &quot;Delgo&quot; to attract audiences reflects a glut of films in the crowded holiday corridor and highlights the challenges facing films made and marketed outside the Hollywood system.&quot;

On August 26, 2009, the makers of &quot;Delgo&quot; were actually considering suing James Cameron for &quot;Avatar&quot;, claiming that it stole some of assets, ideas, visuals, and concepts from &quot;Delgo&quot;. The case was eventually dropped.

<text>The Clay Springs and Apopka Railroad ran from the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad&#x27;s Orlando Division southeast of Apopka, north and northeast across the Florida Midland Railroad at East Apopka, to Clay Springs (now Wekiwa Springs), Florida, United States. It was operational from around 1890 to sometime after 1919. If it had not already been shut down, the paving of Wekiwa Springs Road (Orange County Bond Project 44) in the late 1920s spelled the demise of the railroad.

<doc id="1144930" wikidata="Q2544896" url="?curid=1144930" title="Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer">
<text>Albert Edward John Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, (23 May 1892 – 9 June 1975), styled The Honourable Albert Spencer until 1910 and Viscount Althorp from 1910 to 1922, and known less formally as Jack Spencer, was a British peer. He was the paternal grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales.

==Early life==
Lord Spencer was born in London, the son of Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, and his wife, the former Margaret Baring, second daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke. His godparents included Edward VII.

He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a friend of Lionel Lupton, who studied the same subject at Trinity. They signed up together to fight in World War I. Lupton&#x27;s sister Olive Middleton was the great grandmother of Catherine Middleton who married the great-grandson of Lord Spencer, Prince William, in April 2011.

==Career==
On 5 August 1914, Spencer was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Life Guards, was promoted to lieutenant on 21 October 1914, appointed an aide-de-camp on 9 May 1917, and promoted to captain on 15 June 1917. When 1st Life Guards merged with the 2nd Life Guards on 18 November 1922, Spencer was appointed a captain in the new regiment. He retired from the army on 20 September 1924, but remained a member of the Regular Army Reserve of Officers until reaching the mandatory retirement age on 2 June 1943.

On 27 August 1924, Lord Spencer was appointed the Honorary Colonel of the 4th (Territorial) Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, remaining in that role when it was renamed 50th (Northampton Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion on 1 October 1937, and throughout its various post-war incarnations until finally relinquishing his appointment on 1 April 1967. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration on 12 September 1944, with two clasps on 20 November 1953.

On 9 April 1935, Lord Spencer was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, and became Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire on 11 March 1952, serving until 31 July 1967. He was made a knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem on 1 July 1955.

Lord Spencer was active in the local politics of Northamptonshire as a Conservative councillor. He opened his ancestral home, Althorp, to the public and was a well-known art connoisseur, being a trustee of the Wallace Collection and chairman of the Royal School of Needlework. He was a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts, and for eight years in the 1960s he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was Chairman of the Governors at Wellingborough School from 1946 to 1972.

==Personal life==
Lord Spencer married Lady Cynthia Hamilton, second daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn, on 26 February 1919 at St. James&#x27;s Church in Piccadilly, London, and they had two children:

*Lady Anne Spencer (4 August 1920 – 24 February 2020) married in 1944 to Captain Christopher Wake-Walker (1920–1998), son of Admiral Sir Frederic Wake-Walker, had issue.
*John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (24 January 1924 – 29 March 1992).

Lord Spencer died at St Matthews Nursing Home, Northampton, after a short illness, and was succeeded by his son, John, who was the father of Diana, Princess of Wales.

<text>Robert J. Woodhead (born 1958 or 1959) is an American entrepreneur, software engineer and former game programmer. He is the co-creator of the &quot;Wizardry&quot; franchise, and the co-founder of both the video game publishing company Sir-Tech and anime licensing company AnimEigo.

He claims that a common thread in his career is &quot;doing weird things with computers&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1979, he co-founded Sirotech (later known as Sir-Tech) with Norman Sirotek and Robert Sirotek. Along with Andrew C. Greenberg, he created the Apple II game &quot;&quot;, one of the first role-playing video games written for a personal computer, as well as several of its sequels. Woodhead designed the 1982 Apple II arcade game &quot;Star Maze&quot;, which was programmed by Gordon Eastman and sold through Sir-Tech. He told &quot;TODAY&quot; magazine in 1983, &quot;I have loads of arcade game ideas, but lack the patience to do the actual coding. I&#x27;m sort of a big project person; I like the challenge of a program like &quot;Wizardry&quot;.&quot;

Later, he authored Interferon and Virex, two of the earliest anti-virus applications for the Macintosh, and co-founded AnimEigo, one of the first US anime releasing companies. As a result of this venture, while living in Japan, he married his translator and interpreter, Natsumi Ueki, together with whom he has two children. He also ran a search engine promotion website called SelfPromotion.com.

As a hobby, he builds combat robots, and his children, James Ueki and Alex Ueki, are the 2004 and 2005 Robot Fighting League National Champions in the 30 lb Featherweight class.

Woodhead made a cameo appearance in the 1982 video game &quot;Ultima II&quot; as an NPC; when the player talked to him he would scream &quot;Copy Protect!&quot;, a sarcastic reference to the extensive copy protection methods used in video games of the time. He also has a screen credit in the film &quot;Real Genius&quot; as their &quot;Hacking Consultant&quot;.

Woodhead has created two successful Kickstarter projects, &quot;&quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray Set&quot; ($153,964 pledged on a $75,000 goal), and &quot;BackerSupport&quot; ($326 pledged on a $100 goal).

Woodhead has also served on the Eve Online Council of Stellar Management with an in-game avatar name of Trebor Daehdoow. He was re-elected for 4 terms, serving in his last term as Chairman.

<doc id="1144937" wikidata="Q1032902" url="?curid=1144937" title="Mucin-16">
<text>Mucin-16 (MUC-16) also known as Ovarian cancer-related tumor marker CA125 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;MUC16&quot; gene. MUC-16 is a member of the mucin family glycoproteins. MUC-16 has found application as a tumor marker or biomarker that may be elevated in the blood of some patients with specific types of cancers, most notably ovarian cancer, or other conditions that are benign.

== Structure ==

Mucin 16 is a membrane associated mucin that possesses a single transmembrane domain. A unique property of MUC16 is its large size. MUC16 is more than twice as long as MUC1 and MUC4 and contains about 22,000 amino acids, making it the largest membrane-associated mucin.

MUC16 is composed of three different domains: 
* An N-terminal domain 
* A tandem repeat domain
* A C-terminal domain

The N-terminal and tandem repeat domains are both entirely extracellular and highly O-glycosylated. All mucins contain a tandem repeat domain that has repeating amino acid sequences high in serine, threonine and proline. The C-terminal domain contains multiple extracellular SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) modules, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region of MUC16 can be released from the cell surface by undergoing proteolytic cleavage. MUC16 is thought to be cleaved at a site in the SEA modules.

== Function ==

MUC16 is a component of the ocular surface (including the cornea and conjunctiva), the respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract epithelia. Since MUC16 is highly glycosylated it creates a hydrophilic environment that acts as a lubricating barrier against foreign particles and infectious agents on the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Also, the cytoplasmic tail of MUC16 has been shown to interact with cytoskeleton by binding members of the ERM protein family. The expression of mucin 16 has been shown to be altered in dry eye, cystic fibrosis, and several types of cancers.

==Role in cancer==

MUC16 (CA-125) has been shown to play a role in advancing tumorigenesis and tumor proliferation by several different mechanisms.

=== As a biomarker ===

Testing of CA-125 blood levels has been proposed as useful in treating ovarian cancer. While the test can give useful information for women already known to have ovarian cancer, CA-125 testing has not been found useful as a screening method because of the uncertain correlation between CA-125 levels and cancer. In addition to ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be elevated in patients who have conditions such as endometrial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. It can also be increased in pregnant women. Because of the wide variety of conditions that can increase serum levels, CA-125 is not used to detect cancer, but it is often used to monitor responses to chemotherapy, relapse, and disease progression in ovarian cancer patients.

===Metastatic invasion===

MUC16 is also thought to participate in cell-to-cell interactions that enable the metastasis of tumor cells. This is supported by evidence showing that MUC16 binds selectively to mesothelin, a glycoprotein normally expressed by the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). MUC16 and mesothelin interactions are thought to provide the first step in tumor cell invasion of the peritoneum. The region (residues 296–359) consisting of 64 amino acids at the N-terminus of cell surface mesothelin has been experimentally established as the functional binding domain (named IAB) for MUC16/CA125. An immunoadhesin (HN125) that consists of the IAB domain of mesothelin and the human Fc portion has the ability to disrupt the heterotypic cancer cell adhesion mediated by the MUC16-mesothelin interaction.

Mesothelin has also been found to be expressed in several types of cancers including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Since mesothelin is also expressed by tumor cells, MUC16 and mesothelial interactions may aid in the gathering of other tumor cells to the location of a metastasis, thus increasing the size of the metastasis.

===Induced motility===

Evidence suggests that expression of the cytoplasmic tail of MUC16 enables tumor cells to grow, promotes cell motility and may facilitate invasion. This appears to be due to the ability of the C-terminal domain of MUC16 to facilitate signaling that leads to a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and increase the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, which are expression patterns consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

===Chemotherapy resistance===

MUC16 may also play a role in reducing the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug therapy. For example, overexpression of MUC16 has been shown to protect cells from the effects of genotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin.

== Discovery ==
CA-125 was initially detected using the murine monoclonal antibody designated OC125. Robert Bast, Robert Knapp and their research team first isolated this monoclonal antibody in 1981. The protein was named &quot;cancer antigen 125&quot; because OC125 was the 125th antibody produced against the ovarian cancer cell line that was being studied.

<text>Cayo Luis Peña, formerly South West Key, is a small uninhabited island off the west coast of Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico. The island is a nature reserve which forms part of the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge. Visitors are allowed on the island for nature walks, snorkeling, and swimming; however, visitors are not allowed to stay on the island overnight. The island is only accessible via private water taxis. This limited access results in relatively few visitors and the island and surrounding reefs are able to stay more pristine as a result. The small number of visitors also makes the island more private for those willing to make the journey. Luis Peña Beach is located on the north side of the island. The island is named after its second owner.

<text>The Collegium Trilingue, often also called Collegium trium linguarum, or, after its creator Collegium Buslidianum (, ), is a university that was founded in 1517 under the patronage of the humanist, Hieronymus van Busleyden. The three languages taught were Latin, Greek and Hebrew. It was the model for the Collège de France founded in 1530. It is located in Leuven, Belgium.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Collegium Trilingue was founded thanks to a bequest of Hieronymus Busleyden (c. 1470–1517). Busleyden was born into an influential Luxembourgish family; his father Gilles was a counsellor to Charles the Bold. He studied law in Louvain (during the 1490s), Orléans (at the close of the fifteenth century), and Padua (1501–1503). 

During his studies he made the acquaintance of Desiderius Erasmus, one of the leading intellectuals of his age. Busleyden served as a diplomat under Philip I of Castile the Handsome, a function he combined with that of Master of Requests at the Great Council of Mechlin. 

Busleyden was also a humanist Maecenas, as well as an art and music lover. In 1503, he started renovating the Mechlin Busleyden Court, turning it into a Renaissance palace whose beauty Thomas admired (&quot;... ut me plane obstupefecerit …&quot;). 

Busleyden died unexpectedly in August 1517, after he had fallen ill during a diplomatic mission to Spain. The date of his will, 22 June 1517, is generally taken as the foundation date of the Collegium Trilingue.

Busleyden had been advised on the structure and organization of the college by his friend Erasmus. Poor students could apply for one of ten scholarships, while high-born students should pay a fee; and there were three scholarships for professors, one for each language. They should teach publicly, the will stated, and their classes should be free of charge. The supervision of the daily activities of the college and its finances was the responsibility of the president. Erasmus never taught at the Collegium Trilingue, nor did he ever serve in the administration of the college. 

The executors of Busleyden&#x27;s will initially wished for the college to be integrated into one of the existing colleges of the University of Louvain. Their wish did not materialize, however, mainly because of the opposition from the members of the Arts Faculty, which organized Latin courses and did not want competition.

In April 1519, the executors acquired a number of buildings in the vicinity of the Vismarkt. The building complex was inaugurated in October 1520, after extensive renovation works. In addition to a chapel and auditoria, the complex consisted of a kitchen, refectory, rooms for students and professors (accessible through the so-called ‘Wentelsteen’, which still exists today) and a library, providing storage for Busleyden’s invaluable collection of books of manuscripts, which had been brought over from Mechlin by boat. The lectures started well before the construction was finished.

At the instigation of Erasmus, Matthaeus Adrianus (c. 1475–after 1521) started with the Hebrew lectures as early as March 1518, and Hadrianus Barlandus (1486–1536; Latin) and Rutger Rescius (c. 1495–1545; Greek) followed suit in September of the same year.

Meanwhile the relationship with the university remained troublesome. The recent Reuchlin affair in Cologne and the stir caused by Luther in Wittenberg only strengthened the theologians&#x27; aversion to the study of Greek and Hebrew, and the Arts Faculty wanted to maintain its monopoly of language teaching. After lingering negotiations and several interventions of important personalities, including the later pope Adrian VI, the Collegium Trilingue was recognized as a university institute by the university council in March 1520. The college was, however, never incorporated into the structure of its natural partner, the Arts Faculty.

===The 16th century===
The Collegium Trilingue experienced a difficult start, which, as mentioned, was partly due to issues of housing and the tense relationship with the different faculties. 

Both the college and its guiding spirit Erasmus were attacked in academic disputes and sermons by numerous theologians, accusing Erasmus of sympathizing with the Lutheran cause and of other heresies, and claiming that the study of languages was useless at best and harmful at worst for the intellectual development of youngsters.

The concerns and critiques that were voiced by the Louvain theologians were compiled and put to paper in the &quot;De trium linguarum et studii theologici ratione dialogus&quot; (1519) of Jacobus Latomus (c. 1475–1544), a professor of theology and advisor to the Inquisition. 

A further complicating factor was the coming and going of lecturers. Adrianus (Hebrew) left Louvain in dubious circumstances in July 1519, and neither of his immediate successors – Robert Wakefield (d. 1537) and Robert Sherwood, both English by birth – stayed long either. Barlandus (Latin) left in November 1519 and was succeeded by Conrad Goclenius (1490–1539). Rescius (Greek) even spent some time in jail.

The story of the Collegium Trilingue during the 16th century is nonetheless one of success, largely due to the enduring popularity of Erasmus’ scientific and theological program. This program was inspired by Italian humanism, and by the Italian humanist practice of reading literary texts from Greek and Latin Antiquity in specific. The notorious polemicist Lorenzo Valla (c. 1407–1457) had extended the method to the study of the Holy Writ in his &quot;Annotationes in Novum Testamentum&quot;. 

Erasmus had discovered a copy of this work in 1504, in the Park Abbey near Louvain, and Valla was the inspiration behind much of Erasmus’ own theological thought. The Valla-Erasmus method can be summarized by the dictum ‘Ad fontes’: the scientific study of theology should be grounded in a critical reading of the source texts, and should not start from the authorities of medieval scholasticism. To engage in such a reading, a solid grasp of the three holy languages – Latin, Greek and Hebrew – is indispensable. This is the need the Collegium Trilingue addressed: the courses that were organized there were specifically intended to provide students with the basic linguistic competences they needed to read and study scripture. 

The college’s program attracted hundreds of students from the early years onward, and already during the 1520s an extension of the existing auditoria was required to accommodate the ever increasing influx of youngsters.

Even after the construction works were finished, Goclenius still had to teach the same class twice due to a lack of space. Throughout the period, the number of people actually living in the college – the president, professors, bursaries, paying students, and staff – remained constant, around twenty in total. Their daily routine included attending masses and participating in communal meals, which were usually copious and varied, particularly on special occasions (as when Erasmus visited). The students additionally carried out small household tasks in the college, and they could make use of the college’s five (i.e., ‘pelotte’) facilities for relaxation.

During the first fifty years after its foundation, the Collegium Trilingue could pride itself on having several prominent figures among its professors. Among them was Petrus Nannius (1496–1557), who held the Latin chair between 1539 and 1557, succeeding to Goclenius, and is known for his work on Virgil (&quot;Deuterologiae sive spicilegia Petri Nannii Alcmariani in quartum librum Aeneidos Virgilii&quot;, 1544).

Nannius’ successor was the Utrecht scholar and teacher of Justus Lipsius (1547–1606), Cornelius Valerius (1512–1578). Valerius was a gifted pedagogue.

Relying on mainly Virgil and Cicero, who both belonged to the household authors at the college, Valerius wrote a series of textbooks, including one on grammar and one on rhetoric, which were both reprinted numerous times well into the seventeenth century (&quot;Grammaticarum institutionum libri&quot;, 1550; &quot;In universam bene dicendi rationem tabula&quot;, 1558).

The college’s alumni from the sixteenth century include several figures who contributed greatly to the advancement of not only philology but a great number of fields of study, including cartography (Mercator), (ancient) history (Lipsius), and medicine (Dodoens, Vesalius).

This period of prosperity came to an abrupt end during the final quarter of the sixteenth century, when Louvain was occupied by Spanish troops in the course of the Eighty Years’ War.

The city and its surrounding area were sacked, and suffered from famine and the plague. Most teaching at the Collegium Trilingue was suspended, after student numbers had dropped drastically (both at the university and at the college), and most professors had fled the city.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In the early 17th century, the Collegium Trilingue was in a deplorable state, despite the appointment of the eminent humanist scholar and philologist Justus Lipsius to the Latin chair in 1592.

A new period of prosperity started when Adrianus Baecx was appointed president in 1606, although the college would never again have the same status as during the early 16th century. Baecx had the buildings of the college restored, and he succeeded in filling the chairs of Greek and Hebrew, which had been vacant ever since the turmoil of the 1580s and 1590s.

Baecx&#x27; new Hebrew professor, Valerius Andreas (1588–1655), was one of the very best Hebraists ever to have taught in the college. The teaching of Latin was put into the competent hands of Erycius Puteanus (1547–1646), a student of Lipsius, who enjoyed an international reputation for his rhetorical skill and pedagogical insight. Puteanus was appointed in 1607, and he held the Latin chair for nearly forty years; he was eventually succeeded by Nicolaus Vernulaeus (1583–1649) in 1646. 

Vernulaeus taught Latin until his death in 1649. Not averse to self-adulation, Vernulaeus emphasized in his &quot;Academia Lovaniensis&quot; (1627) that since its foundation in 1517 the Collegium Trilingue had managed to produce first-rung figures in each and every branch of intellectual inquiry.

After the days of Puteanus and Vernulaeus, the college entered a period of decline. There were occasional resurgences, but they were scarce and usually also short-lived, being due to the activities of one professor specifically. Worthy of mention in this regard is Johannes Gerardus Kerkherderen (1677–1738), who taught Latin in the second quarter of the 18th century, as well as Jean-Noël Paquot (1722–1803). 

Paquot taught Hebrew, and authored the monumental &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire littéraire des dix-sept provinces des Pays-Bas, de la principauté de Liège, et de quelques contrées voisines&quot; (1763–1770, 18 vols.), which to this day is an important source of information regarding the history of the Collegium Trilingue, which survived, but did not flourish.

The Latin chair remained vacant after 1768, and along with the university the Collegium Trilingue was suspended in 1797 during the period of unrest that followed the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. The buildings that constituted the college were sold, and after the reinstatement of the university in 1834 the college was never revived.

In the early 20th century, the rector of the University of Louvain, Paulin Ladeuze, envisaged bringing the buildings of the former college into the possession of the university and turn them into a center of humanist studies once again, but these attempts, during the financially challenging period around the First World War, ultimately proved unsuccessful. 

The 1970s witnessed a second attempt at revival, which did not materialize either. 

During this later period, the buildings of the once-celebrated college served as a social house, printing establishment, ice factory and fish smokehouse, among other things.

<text>SS &quot;Deutschland&quot; was a German ocean liner of the HAPAG line. It was sunk in a British air attack on May 3, 1945. 

==History==
===Commissioning===
One of a group of four ships that included the , , and , the &quot;Deutschland&quot; was launched on 28 April 1923. She began her maiden voyage on 27 March 1924, to Southampton and then on to New York City. The turbine-powered ship had a speed of ; she was later re-engined with larger-geared turbines in 1929, with service speed increased to . This gave the ship a seven-day passage across the Atlantic.

On 11 November 1933, &quot;Deutschland&quot; collided with the American cargo ship in New York Harbor. &quot;Munargo&quot; suffered severe damage and was beached north of Bedloe&#x27;s Island, but was refloated on 18 November 1933.

In October 1938, while en route to New York with 981 persons aboard the ship suffered an explosion in her Number Two hold. After calling for assistance, the crew was able to bring the fire under control and continue on her itinerary.

===World War II===
In 1940, &quot;Deutschland&quot; became an accommodation ship for the German Navy at Gotenhafen. In 1945, on seven Baltic voyages as part of Operation Hannibal, she carried 70,000 refugees from the German eastern territories to the west.

===Sinking===
In April 1945, her conversion into a hospital ship was begun. An attempt was made to paint the vessel white, but there was only sufficient paint available to paint her funnels white, and to paint a Red Cross on one side of one of her funnels. 

Between 16 and 28 April 1945, the concentration camp of Neuengamme was systematically emptied of all its remaining prisoners, other groups of concentration camp inmates and Soviet prisoners of war (POWs); with the intention that they would be relocated to a secret new camp. In the interim, they were to be concealed from the advancing British and Canadian forces; and for this purpose the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; assembled a prison flotilla of decommissioned ships in the Bay of Lübeck, consisting of the liners and &quot;Deutschland&quot;, the freighter , and the motor launch &quot;Athens&quot;. Since the steering motors were out of use in &quot;Thielbek&quot; and the turbines were out of use in &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, &quot;Athens&quot; was used to transfer prisoners from Lübeck to the larger ships and between ships; they were locked below decks and in the holds, and denied food and medical attention. 

During the first days of May 1945, thousands of concentration camp inmates were locked below decks and in the holds, and denied food and medical attention. All people on board the &quot;Deutschland&quot; survived the attack, though two accompanying vessels sank with great loss of life. Subsequently, on 3 May 1945, she was attacked by British Royal Air Force squadrons three times, and capsized and sank in the Bay of Lübeck off Neustadt, but everyone aboard survived. A fourth British air attack that day sank the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; and &quot;Thielbek&quot;, with great loss of life.

In 1949, the wreck was raised and scrapped.

<doc id="1144989" wikidata="Q5634299" url="?curid=1144989" title="HMS Shah (1873)">
<text>The first HMS &quot;Shah&quot; was a nineteenth-century unarmoured iron hulled, wooden sheathed frigate of Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy designed by Sir Edward Reed. She was originally to be named HMS &quot;Blonde&quot; but was renamed following the visit of the Shah of Persia in 1873.

==Building programme==
The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the &quot;Shah&quot; and the other two iron frigates: &quot;Inconstant&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot;. Standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores. 
*Date first commissioned.

Her complement was 469 officers and men, 46 boys and 87 marines.

==Armament==
As of 1888, &quot;Shah&quot; was armed with two 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns, sixteen 7-inch 6½ ton rifled muzzle-loading guns, eight 5-inch breech-loading guns, three quick-firing guns, twelve machine-guns, and four torpedo launchers.

==Service career==
She was only in service for three years. In 1876, she was deployed as flagship of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Pacific Station under Admiral de Horsey, relieving HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;.

On 29 May 1877, in company with the corvette HMS &quot;Amethyst&quot;, she fought an action near Ilo, Peru, the Battle of Pacocha. This was against the Peruvian armoured single-turret ship &quot;Huáscar&quot;, which had been taken over by anti-government rebels, and had boarded some British merchant ships.

The armoured &quot;Huáscar&quot; proved virtually impenetrable to the British guns, but the two unarmoured British ships had to keep clear of the &quot;Huáscar&quot;’s turret guns. Although &quot;Shah&quot; was the fastest battleship then afloat, the smaller &quot;Huáscar&quot; was more maneuverable in the shallow waters. In the course of the action, &quot;Shah&quot; fired the first torpedo to be used in anger, although it missed – being outrun by &quot;Huáscar&quot;.

During her time as flagship she also visited Pitcairn Island. On her voyage home in 1879, she called at St. Helena, where news was received of the British defeat at Isandhlwana. &quot;Shah&quot; was diverted to carry soldiers to Durban in South Africa. She then formed part of a Royal Naval contingent that assisted in the Anglo-Zulu War, before she completed her voyage to Britain.

On 24 October 1879 some of her crew were paid off at Portsmouth and &quot;Shah&quot; was placed in the fourth division of the Steam Reserve, then joined the North America and West Indies Station at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island, Bermuda, to provide accommodation. HMS &quot;Malabar&quot; took over this task in 1897.

In December 1904, &quot;Shah&quot; was converted to a coal storage hulk and renamed &quot;C.470&quot;. The hulk was sold on 19 September 1919. In 1926 the hulk was wrecked, at Bermuda.

According to some sources (primarily Danish), the ship was eventually sold to Danish salvage company Petersen &amp; Albeck in 1934, towed to Copenhagen, and dismantled there. Part of the teakwood interior was later used as floor planks at the Royal Castle in Gråsten in 1936.

Her masts survive. Being iron, they were deemed to be a lighter, more durable, replacement for the wooden masts of HMS &quot;Victory&quot;. They were probably fitted to &quot;Victory&quot; when she was dry docked in 1887, and survive to the present day in her preserved state.

Her stern-plaque, a gift from the Shah of Persia, was restored in 1974 by HMS &quot;Malabar&quot; (Her Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base Bermuda, the remnant of the Royal Naval Dockyard). It is on display at the St. George&#x27;s Historical Society Museum, in the Mitchell House in St. George&#x27;s Town, Bermuda).

There is a monument to the ship&#x27;s crew in Victoria Park, Portsmouth.

<doc id="1144991" wikidata="Q1849822" url="?curid=1144991" title="Virtua Racing">
<text>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing video game developed by Sega AM2 and released for arcades in 1992. &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D graphics platform under development, the &quot;Model 1&quot;. The results were so encouraging that &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was fully developed into a standalone arcade title.

The original arcade game has three circuits, designated into difficulties. Beginner is Big Forest, intermediate is Bay Bridge and expert is Acropolis. Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in &quot;Big Forest&quot;, or the &quot;Bay Bridge&quot; itself, or the tight hairpin of &quot;Acropolis&quot;. When selecting a car, the player can choose different transmission types. &quot;VR&quot; introduced the &quot;V.R. View System&quot; by allowing the player to choose one of four views to play the game. This feature was then used in most other Sega arcade racing games (and is mentioned as a feature in the attract mode of games such as &quot;Daytona USA&quot;).

&quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was among the highest-grossing arcade games of 1992 in Japan and North America, 1993 in Europe, Australia and worldwide, and it successfully received the award for Most Innovative New Technology from the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA). &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygon graphics among a wider audience. It was later ported to home consoles, starting with the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.

==Arcade cabinet versions==
===&quot;Twin&quot;===
&quot;V.R.&quot; was released in a &quot;twin&quot; cabinet – the standard and most common version, which is effectively 2 complete machines built into a single cabinet. The Twin cabinets for the U.S. were manufactured by contract at Grand Products, Inc. in Illinois for Sega and were built using Wells-Gardner 25&quot; monitors. The Twin cabinet that was sold in the rest of the world was built by Sega in Japan and used 29&quot; Nanao monitors.

Also available was an upright (UR), which was a single-player cabinet using the same force-feedback steering as the twin. The cabinet cost between about and £12,000 or .

===&quot;DX&quot;===
There was also a Deluxe version, known as the &quot;V.R. DX&quot; cabinet type, which is also a single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio Hantarex monitor (the first use of a widescreen aspect ratio monitor in an arcade game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and &quot;nudge&quot; the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player&#x27;s back that inflates under braking. The seat is also adjustable via &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;back&quot; buttons using air pressure. &quot;V.R. DX&quot;&#x27;s force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor-and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the steering feel is quite different.

The Deluxe version was manufactured in Sega&#x27;s Japanese factories for worldwide markets, while the Twin version in the US was manufactured domestically by Grand Products. The Deluxe version was priced at $2 per play and the Twin version at $0.75 per play. While Sega had previously charged higher for the R360 cabinet, this was the first time that a mass-production arcade game cost $2 per play. In 1992, the cabinet cost £20,000 or to purchase.

===&quot;Virtua Formula&quot;===
&quot;Virtua Formula&quot; was released in 1993. It was unveiled at the opening of Sega&#x27;s second arcade amusement park Joypolis, where a whole room with 32 machines was dedicated to the game. &quot;Virtua Formula&quot; was effectively a &quot;super DX&quot; version of &quot;V.R.&quot; and the player sat in a full-motion hydraulically actuated Formula One car &#x27;replica&#x27; in front of a 50-inch screen. Most of these units were converted into Sega&#x27;s second-generation Indy car simulator, &quot;Indy 500&quot;, and are commonly found at larger Sega Gameworks locations in the U.S.

All versions of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; are linkable up to 8-players; meaning 4 twin units or 8 &quot;DX&quot;, &quot;UR&quot;, or &quot;Virtua Formula&quot; cabinets can be linked together using fiber-optic cables. In addition to this, there was an optional display known as the &quot;Live Monitor&quot; that would sit atop the twin cabinets and replay action shots of what was occurring with actual players in a &quot;virtual sportscast&quot; by a virtual commentator, &quot;Virt McPolygon&quot;. A four-player &quot;Virtua Formula&quot; cabinet setup cost around £250,000 or in 1994.

==Development==
&quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was developed alongside the Sega Model 1 arcade system, originally called the &quot;CG Board&quot; system prior to completion. The game was directed by Yu Suzuki and designed by Toshihiro Nagoshi.

The origins of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, along with the Model 1, date back to the development of the Mega Drive/Genesis console prior to its launch in 1988. The console was a major leap forward for home video game systems, allowing them to come closer to arcade quality. For Sega&#x27;s arcade games to remain profitable, they needed to maintain a wide gap between arcade and home video games. At a meeting held during the console&#x27;s development, Sega decided to begin development on an arcade system capable of producing 3D polygon graphics. This led to the development of the Sega Model 1, along with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, by the early 1990s. They had arcade competitors (Namco and Atari Games) who predated Sega in the use of 3D polygon graphics, displaying up to 2,000 polygons per frame, so Sega increased their Model 1 system&#x27;s capabilities significantly beyond that to 6,500 polygons per frame.

In 1989, Sega of America&#x27;s Tom Petit mentioned that Sega was &quot;hiring 400 new engineers to research and develop new technology&quot; and that they &quot;have innovative, revolutionary graphics display systems to come&quot; which would make even &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; (their latest arcade racer at the time) &quot;seem like the yesterday of technology.&quot; The Sega Model 1 system was developed internally at Sega between 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Petit stated that, &quot;next year, you will see a new trend of technology that will be instrumental in providing new vitality for our industry&quot; and that it could &quot;have as much impact on the business as&quot; &quot;Hang-On&quot; &quot;did to influence our last growth market&quot; back in 1985.

==Home console versions==
===Sega Mega Drive/Genesis===
Due to the complexity of the Model 1 board, a home console version seemed unlikely, until 1994 when a cartridge design incorporating the Sega Virtua Processor (SVP) on an extra chip was created to enable a version on the Genesis/Mega Drive. This chip was extremely expensive to manufacture, leading Sega to price the Genesis version of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; unusually high: US$100 in the United States and £70 in the United Kingdom.

The game renders 9,000 polygons per second with the SVP chip, significantly higher than what the standard Genesis/Mega Drive hardware is capable of. It also outperformed Nintendo&#x27;s rival SuperFX chip for the Super NES. The game was incompatible with Majesco Entertainment&#x27;s re-released Genesis 3 from 1998, and would not work on any Genesis equipped with a Sega 32X.

===32X===
The Sega 32X version, also known as &quot;Virtua Racing Deluxe&quot;, was released as launch title for North America in 1994, and then a year later in PAL regions. It was developed by Sega AM2, and published by Sega under the Sega Sports label. It performed a bit more closely to the original arcade version and included two extra cars (&quot;Stock&quot; and &quot;Prototype&quot;) as well as two new tracks (&quot;Highland&quot; and &quot;Sand Park&quot;).

===Sega Saturn===
The Sega Saturn version, previously known by the working title &quot;Virtua Racing Saturn&quot;, was released in 1995 and developed and published by Time Warner Interactive. As the developers lacked the original source code, they had to create this version based on observation of the arcade game. The Saturn release has the game soundtrack as standard Red Book audio, which can be listened to in any CD player. The Saturn version also includes seven new courses and four new cars, as well as a secret &quot;F-200 Super Car&quot; unlockable via a cheat code, or by placing first in every race with every car. Unlike other versions, it features Grand Prix mode, where players drive a series of cars and the tracks to earn points.

===PlayStation 2===
A remake, called &quot;Virtua Racing: FlatOut&quot;, was released for the PlayStation 2 under the Sega Ages 2500 label. It was released in Japan in 2004 and in North America and Europe in 2005 as part of the &quot;Sega Classics Collection&quot; titled simply &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. It includes three new courses and four new cars.

===Nintendo Switch===
As part of the Sega Ages series, a port of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; for the Nintendo Switch was released digitally in Japan on April 24, 2019, and elsewhere on June 27. Developed by M2, it is a port of the original arcade version with the frame rate increased to 60fps and presented in the 16:9 aspect ratio. Also new to this port is the ability to play online with up to 2 players and offline with up to 8 players on a single system. The game also features online leaderboards with downloadable replays for the top 50 players on each track, an additional easier steering option and a Grand Prix mode that increases the number of laps to 20. Virt McPolygon also cameos in the game upon replaying a Grand Prix race.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
The arcade game was a major worldwide commercial success upon release, surpassing Sega&#x27;s expectations and with high demand exceeding production output. The Deluxe and Twin cabinets were both selling very well, with the expensive Deluxe version selling about a fifth as many units as the less expensive Twin version during 1992. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their October 15, 1992, issue as the most successful upright/cockpit arcade cabinet of the month. In the United States, it debuted at the top of the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade earnings chart for deluxe cabinets in October 1992. It remained at the top for the rest of 1992, and much of the following year from February 1993 to July 1993, until it was dethroned by Sega AM1&#x27;s &quot;Stadium Cross&quot; (with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; at number two) in August 1993. &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; remained at number-two in October 1993, below &quot;Suzuka 8 Hours&quot;. &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was America&#x27;s third top-grossing arcade game during Summer 1993. The game was also a major commercial success in Europe.

&quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was one of the top ten highest-grossing arcade games of 1992 in Japan and the United States. The following year, it was the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1993 in Japan, and one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1993.

The arcade game was well received by critics upon release. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it a &quot;racing masterpiece&quot; and said its &quot;lifelike racing sensations are extremely impressive and exciting&quot;. They called it &quot;one of the most realistic racing games ever&quot; and concluded that it leaves &quot;all other racing games eating its technological dust&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed &quot;Virtua Formula&quot; in early 1994, stating that it is &quot;one of the most exciting&quot; arcade driving games and praising the &quot;hydraulic control&quot; of the cabinet. They concluded that, while its graphics are not as &quot;drop-dead stunning&quot; as the more recent &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; still has a greater &quot;heart-pumping sense of speed&quot;. Brazilian magazine &quot;Ação Games&quot; gave the game 4/4 on all four categories, and called it the most complex racing game on Earth.

At Japan&#x27;s 1992 , it was nominated for Best Action, Best Direction, and Best Graphics, but lost to &quot;Street Fighter II′: Champion Edition&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, and &quot;Xexex&quot;, respectively. At North America&#x27;s 1993 AMOA Awards, held by the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA), &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; won the award for Most Innovative New Technology.

===Ports===
&quot;GamePro&quot; named the Genesis/Mega Drive version the best Genesis game shown at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, commenting: &quot;While obviously a great deal of graphic clarity, detail, and color was lost, the game play is stunningly faithful to the coin-op. ... this is the best version [of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;] you&#x27;ll see until Sega&#x27;s mystery 32-bit home system leaves orbit&quot;. In their later review, they complimented the game on its inclusion of all the elements of the arcade version aside from the support for up to eight players, and remarked that though the graphics are not as good as the arcade version, they feature faster-moving polygons than any other cartridge game. They criticized the audio and low longevity but nonetheless concluded &quot;VR is the best 16-bit racer yet&quot;. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored it 31 out of 40 (average 7.75 out of 10). Like &quot;GamePro&quot;, they criticized the audio but held that the game, though not as good as the arcade version, was the best racer yet seen on cartridge-based systems. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the Mega Drive version of the game 33 out of 40, calling it a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; port; later in September 1994, their Reader Cross Review gave it an 8 out of 10. &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; stated that &quot;the speed, graphic intensity and addictive gameplay that made the arcade game a major hit are all included in this awe inspiring release&quot;. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at number 4 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the 32X version a highly positive review, stating that it successfully addressed the Genesis version&#x27;s longevity problem with its new cars and new tracks. They also praised the improved graphics, details, and controls, and the retention of on-the-fly view switching even in two-player split-screen mode. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 32X version of the game, &quot;Virtua Racing Deluxe&quot;, and stated that &quot;&quot;VR Deluxe&quot; is a near-perfect conversion of a game that&#x27;s still fun to play&quot;.

The two sports reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Saturn version scores of 8 and 7 out of 10, with the first reviewer praising the added content and overall improvement over the previous home ports, and the second reviewer saying that the game is enjoyable but doesn&#x27;t fully use the graphical capabilities of the Saturn. &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly remarked: &quot;This version not only looks better than both the Genesis and 32X versions, it also has a ton more options&quot;. They remarked that the graphics are not as good as &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, but that the game has better music and is more fun to play. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; felt that &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was antiquated by this time, particularly with the imminent release of &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; on the Saturn. However, he acknowledged that the game had enough historical impact to draw its share of loyalists, and said the Saturn version &quot;is not only arcade-perfect, it also contains crucial features not present in the original&quot;. Rich Leadbetter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised the additional tracks and cars as giving the game more depth than an arcade racer, but countered that what most gamers wanted was a straight conversion of the coin-op &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, not a home-oriented remake. He concluded that the Saturn version is good on its own terms, but completely overshadowed by the Saturn conversion of &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, which was to be released just a few weeks after. &quot;Maximum&quot; made the same comments but were more vehement in their criticism of the fact that the Saturn version is not a straight conversion of the arcade game.

==Legacy==
In 1994, it appeared at 4th place on &quot;Mega&quot;″s list of Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. In 1995, Flux magazine rated the arcade version 36th in its &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, the arcade, 32X, and Saturn versions (but not the Genesis version) appeared at 11th place on &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s list of Top 100 Games of All Time. They noted that their ranking it higher than any other racing game on the list (including &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; and &quot;Daytona USA&quot;) was deliberate, since &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; &quot;drives better&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the arcade version 32nd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; In 1998, Saturn Power listed the game 92nd in its Top 100 Sega Saturn Games. the felt that Virtua Racing is &quot;not as arcade perfect as it should’ve been.&quot;

===Impact===
In January 1993, &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Sega credits &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; with a huge impact on the rest of the coin-op market&quot; and &quot;believes its new hi-tech driver has single-handedly lifted the simulator niche&quot; into &quot;a growth market.&quot; While acknowledging they had arcade competitors who had introduced 3D polygon graphics before them, Sega of America&#x27;s Tom Petit and Ken Anderson said in December 1992 that Sega approached 3D polygons in their own way with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, which had much more advanced technology, was more successful than earlier attempts, and pushed Sega to the forefront of 3D polygon technology. Petit and Anderson noted the game was drawing large casual audiences, stating &quot;it&#x27;s bringing new people into locations&quot; who &quot;never played before&quot; or &quot;ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t enter an amusement environment&quot; but &quot;word of mouth, the new technology and so on are bringing in new players&quot; both young and old, male and female.

Though its use of 3D polygon graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (&quot;Winning Run&quot; in 1988) and Atari Games (&quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; in 1989), &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience.

In 2015, it appeared at 3rd place on IGN&#x27;s list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever, behind &quot;Pole Position&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. According to Luke Reilly, while &quot;Winning Run&quot; was the first racing game with 3D polygons, &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;″s &quot;bleeding-edge 3D models, complex backdrops, and blistering framerate were unlike anything we’d ever seen&quot;. He added that it &quot;allowed us to toggle between four different views, including chase cam and first-person view&quot; which is &quot;hard to imagine a modern racing game without&quot; and said it &quot;showed the masses what the future of racing games was going to look like&quot;. In 2019, a &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; article by Ken Horowitz called it &quot;one of the most influential coin-ops&quot; of all time.

===Patent dispute===
In 1992, Sega applied for a Japanese patent involving an innovative feature they developed for &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;: changing the 3D camera viewpoint with the press of a button. Sega also used the feature in later games such as &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. It took five years for the patent to process before the patent was successfully granted to Sega in 1997. By that time, camera change buttons had become a common feature in 3D video games. This would mean Sega could earn royalties from 3D video games that used a camera change button feature.

Due to being a common feature used in many 3D video games, Sega received royalties from other companies using the feature in their games, both in Japan and internationally. Atari, for example, paid Sega royalties for using the feature in Atari Jaguar games. Sega also successfully took legal action against Nintendo, among other companies, for using the feature in their games. In the late 1990s, Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment decided to work together to challenge Sega&#x27;s patent in Japanese courts. They found that the 3D camera change button feature of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was used in an earlier title, &quot;Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star&quot;, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; video game developed by Japanese company M.N.M Software (later called Mindware) for the Sharp X68000 computer and released exclusively for the Japanese market in 1991. That game&#x27;s development was led by Mikito Ichikawa, who attended court to testify. Sega&#x27;s patent was eventually revoked as a result of Ichikawa&#x27;s testimony, but Ichikawa himself never received any compensation from Nintendo or other companies. However, Ichikawa revealed that the &quot;Star Wars&quot; game wasn&#x27;t the first either, but the first game to use the feature was &quot;Magical Shot&quot;, a billiards game also developed by M.N.M Software for the X68000 and released exclusively for the Japanese market in 1991.

<text>Jonathan Michael Borwein (20 May 1951 – 2 August 2016) was a Scottish mathematician who held an appointment as Laureate Professor of mathematics at the University of Newcastle, Australia. He was a close associate of David H. Bailey, and they have been prominent public advocates of experimental mathematics.

Borwein&#x27;s interests spanned pure mathematics (analysis), applied mathematics (optimization), computational mathematics (numerical and computational analysis), and high performance computing. He authored ten books, including several on experimental mathematics, a monograph on convex functions, and over 400 refereed articles. He was a co-founder in 1995 of software company MathResources, consulting and producing interactive software primarily for school and university mathematics. He was not associated with MathResources at the time of his death. 

Borwein was also an expert on the number pi and especially its computation.

==Early life and education==
Borwein was born in St. Andrews, Scotland, in 1951 into a Jewish family. His father was mathematician David Borwein, with whom he collaborated. His brother Peter Borwein was also a mathematician.

Borwein was married to Judith (née Roots), and had three daughters.

He received his B.A. (Honours Math) from University of Western Ontario in 1971, and his D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1974 as a Rhodes Scholar at Jesus College.

==Career==

Prior to joining Simon Fraser University in 1993, he worked at Dalhousie University (1974–91), Carnegie-Mellon (1980–82) and the University of Waterloo (1991–93).
He was Shrum Professor of Science (1993–2003) and a Canada Research Chair in Information Technology (2001–08) at Simon Fraser University, where he was founding Director of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and developed the Inverse Symbolic Calculator together with his brother and Simon Plouffe. In 2004, he (re-)joined the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University as a Canada Research Chair in Distributed and Collaborative Research, cross-appointed in Mathematics, while preserving an adjunct appointment at Simon Fraser.

Borwein was Governor at large of the Mathematical Association of America (2004–07), was president of the Canadian Mathematical Society (2000–02) and chair of (the Canadian National Science Library) NRC-CISTI Advisory Board (2000–2003). He served as chair of various NATO scientific programs. He was also Chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI). He chaired the Canadian HPC consortium, later Compute Canada, and the International Mathematical Union&#x27;s Committee on Electronic Information and Communications (2002–2008).

==Awards==
Borwein received various awards including the Chauvenet Prize (1993), Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada (1994), Fellowship in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2002), an honorary degree from Limoges (1999), and foreign membership in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (2003). He was elected as a Fellow to the Australian Academy of Science (2010). In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He was an ISI highly cited mathematician for the period 1981–1999.

<doc id="1145017" wikidata="Q2520041" url="?curid=1145017" title="Duplicate bridge">
<text>Duplicate bridge is a variation of contract bridge where the same set of bridge deals (i.e., the distribution of the 52 cards among the four hands) are played by different competitors, and scoring is based on relative performance. In this way, every hand, whether strong or weak, is played in competition with others playing identical cards, and the element of skill is heightened while that of chance is reduced. This stands in contrast to Bridge played without duplication, where each hand is freshly dealt and where scores may be more affected by chance in the short run.

Four-way card holders known as bridge boards are used to enable each player&#x27;s hand to be preserved from table to table, and final scores are calculated by comparing each pair&#x27;s result with others who played the same hand. 

In duplicate bridge, players normally play all the hands with the same partner, and compete either as a partnership (in a &#x27;Pairs tournament&#x27;) or on a team with one or more other partnerships (&#x27;Teams tournament&#x27; - players are usually allowed to change partner within their team at any point if they wish). &#x27;Individual tournaments&#x27; also exist, in which players change partnerships regularly during the tournament and are ranked on their personal performance.

==History==
 The origins of duplicate bridge are based on the emergence of duplicate whist in the game of whist. In the introduction to his book &quot;Duplicate Whist&quot;, the author comments on the early emergence of duplicate whist: 
Mitchell also recounts the Cavendish experiment of 1857 to demonstrate the merits of duplicate whist in reducing the element of luck and to distinguish between the skill levels of better and poorer players. Cavendish concludes: 
Initially, owing to the early clumsy mechanics of card resorting to reconstruct the hands of a just played deal, the problems resulting from errors made in the transferring of cards between tables, and the unaccustomed movement of players between tables and the resultant slower pace of play, duplicate whist did not gain instant popularity. Nevertheless, the evolution of duplicate whist continued and the procedures and apparatus (known as &quot;trays&quot; or now, more commonly, &quot;boards&quot;) for more conveniently maintaining and transferring the cards of each deal for replay had been greatly improved so that by the 1890s duplicate&#x27;s popularity had become widespread. In turn, as the game of whist was superseded by contract bridge, so was duplicate whist by duplicate bridge.

==Game types==

===Pairs game===

In a pairs tournament, each deal is played a number of times by different players, after which all the scores are compared.

The tournament consists of a number of rounds; in each round, a number of boards (i.e. hands), usually two to five, is played against the same opponents. A session typically consists of between 24 and 28 boards in total, but this can vary. Typically around eight boards are played per hour, so a typical session will last 3 hours or slightly more. If there is an odd number of pairs, one pair will have to sit out in each round. Most events are single-session, but tournament events can consist of two, four or more sessions.

Immediately after a board is played, the North player writes the result of that board on the travelling sheet, and the East player checks it. The information recorded includes at least the (identifying) numbers of the North-South and East-West pairs and the score achieved. Usually the contract and the number of tricks won are also recorded, and sometimes also the opening lead. Sometimes the cards in each hand are also written on the traveller, which is useful in case the cards are inadvertently mixed up. The traveller is contained within and travels with the board. This means that the players learn how they did up to that point on each board. This might be regarded as an advantage or as a disadvantage: information about their relative standing in the field might induce a pair to change their strategy (e.g. aggressive or conservative bidding and play) on the remaining hands. Alternatively, the scores for each round may be recorded on pickup slips collected during the event to enable the scorer to start to process the results before the end of the session, so that the results can be announced soon after the end of the session. A modern development is an electronic data-entry device on each table that transmits the results wirelessly to the director&#x27;s computer. This allows results to be posted at a club or on a website very quickly after the end of play.

The usual form of overall scoring for a pairs tournament is Matchpoint scoring; occasionally IMP scoring is used instead.

Every pair plays against a different opposing pair in each successive round, depending on the size of the field. After each round, some or all of the players reseat themselves according to a prescribed &quot;movement&quot;, so that each pair opposes a different pair in each round; the boards are also moved. The movement must be set up so that each pair does not play more than one round against the same opponents; and, of course, does not play the same board more than once.

The tournament director will select the movement depending on the number of pairs playing, to allow them to play the desired number of boards each, without repetition. Tournaments with up to about a dozen tables are usually played either as a Mitchell movement (each North/South pair plays against all or most East/West pairs) or a Howell movement (each pair plays against all or most other pairs, and switches between North/South and East/West as required). A Howell movement is typically used if there are fewer than about 7 tables. With larger fields the tournament can be split into separate sections (every section operates its own separate movement, but the scores are compared across all sections); each section normally plays a Mitchell movement.

===Table movements===
The Mitchell movement is the most common. The North-South pairs remain stationary. After each round, the East-West pairs move to the next higher-numbered table and the boards move to the next lower table. If the number of tables is odd, every E-W pair will play different boards against every N-S pair after the full circle. In case of an even number of tables, the East-West pairs are told to skip a table after about half the rounds so that they do not encounter boards that they have already played; alternatively (&quot;Relay-bystand Mitchell&quot;), a &quot;bystand&quot; (playerless table) is introduced, while the two tables farthest from the bystand share the boards in each round (the &quot;relay&quot;). Usually, the bystand is placed halfway through the field (e.g. between Tables 5 and 6 if there are 10 tables) and the relay between Table 1 and the last table. A &quot;perfect&quot; Mitchell is seven, nine, or thirteen tables, with four, three, or two boards per round respectively: all players play all boards, and all pairs of each direction play against all pairs of the other direction. A variation of the Mitchell movement employs &quot;arrow-switching&quot;. This means that for approximately one-eighth of the boards played, the N-S pairs play the E-W cards and vice versa. This variation is used when it is desired to have one winner rather than two winners (see below).

The Howell movement is sometimes used instead, usually when there are a relatively small number of tables. This movement is more complicated and varies according to the total number of pairs. All boards and most pairs move after every round according to guide cards placed on the tables, or carried by the players (usually one pair, or sometimes more, remain stationary). The Howell is sometimes considered a fairer test than the Mitchell, because each pair faces all or nearly all of the other pairs, not just the pairs sitting in the opposite direction. However the fairness of a movement depends not only on who one plays against but also to a considerable extent on one&#x27;s indirect opponents, i.e. those who play the same cards as you do. The Howell also tends to be more error-prone than the Mitchell due to its greater complexity. Ideally the number of rounds will be one less than the number of pairs competing, so that each pair plays one round against every other pair. Each round will usually consist of either 2, 3, or 4 boards. However, sometimes this produces an inconvenient total number of boards to be played. To avoid this, a &quot;reduced Howell&quot; or &quot;three-quarter Howell&quot; movement is often played, with fewer rounds and usually with more than one stationary pair, so that the number of rounds plus the number of stationary pairs equals the total number of pairs.

Less common is the Chalfant movement. In this movement, the boards remain stationary while the players move according to guide cards. This requires significantly more physical tables, because several tables are not in play on any given round. (Like the Howell movement, this movement is typically used when there is a relatively small number of players, typically no more than 12 pairs. Also like the Howell movement, this movement produces a single winner and pairs face all or almost all of the other pairs in play.) This movement has the advantage that pairs are often moving to a table that was not in use on a previous round, so a slow pair does not delay as many other pairs as in a Howell. Also, for several sizes, this movement is technically superior in that more pairs face all other pairs than in the corresponding Howell movement. This movement has the disadvantage of requiring a larger number of physical tables, and thus more space. It also requires the players to carry guide cards with them and consult them, while the guide cards usually remain on the tables for Howell movements.

Whatever movement is used, if the number of pairs is odd, obviously one pair must sit idle during each round; that situation is referred to as a &quot;bye&quot; or &quot;sit out&quot;. In that undesirable case, the missing pair (sometimes called the &quot;phantom pair&quot;) is treated as if it exists, i.e. the movement is set up for (number of actual pairs + half a table). The phantom pair may be North-South, East-West or an arbitrary pair number in a Howell movement. In a Mitchell movement, having an East-West phantom pair is advantageous in that there are non-phantom players at each table responsible for correct movement of the boards. During the movement, one pair in each round will sit out (&quot;play&quot; against the phantom pair). Since, as result, pairs will usually play unequal numbers of boards, their final results are normally scaled in the final calculation (known as &quot;factoring&quot;), or less commonly they might be awarded &quot;bye points&quot; for that round (normally, a result slightly above average).

Another arrangement for an odd number of pairs is called a &quot;bump&quot; or &quot;rover&quot; movement, in which the number of tables is rounded down to (number of actual pairs - 1)/2. In a Mitchell movement, the extra pair normally sits out the first round and then, according to a schedule, substitutes for a different North-South pair for each subsequent round (the &quot;bumped&quot; pair having a sit out for that round). The extra pair are frequently referred to as the &quot;rover pair&quot; because, unlike the other North-South pairs, they move at each round. In particular, the bump is preferable to the sit out for 11½ tables: it allows every pair to play at least 24 boards while having only 33 boards in play.

In a Howell movement, the extra pair normally sit out the first round and are then allocated fixed seats where they remain for all subsequent rounds. Any position other than that which would normally be occupied by a stationary pair will do. The extra pair thus displace, or &quot;bump&quot;, a different pair (those who would normally move to those seats) at each round. The extra pair are still colloquially known as the &quot;rover pair&quot; even though, in a Howell, they do not actually rove.

A better alternative is for the phantom pair to be allocated a stationary position. This enables all the boards to be played the same number of times (so that all the pairs play all the boards) and the movement in many cases to be completely fair between all the non-stationary pairs.

Trials are usually reserved for high-level competitions (such as regional and national championships, invitation tournaments etc.). There, a fixed number of pairs (usually 16) play a full round-robin tournament (Swiss can be also used to shorten the tournament) with relatively long matches (8-32 boards) against each other, the entire tournament lasting for two to four days. One session consists of only one round, with boards circulating among the tables and pairs remaining seated. Results are calculated after each round using IMP or Calcutta scoring, converted to Victory points, and added up to the running score. The pair with highest VP score becomes the winner.

===Teams game===
In a teams tournament, two pairs normally constitute a team. (Teams of five or six members are often permitted, but each set of boards will only be played by two pairs in the team, i.e. four members of the team.) If there are just two teams, they compete using two tables and having one pair from each team seated at each table, in opposite directions. (For example, Team A may sit North-South at table 1 and East-West at table 2; then Team B would sit East-West at table 1 and North-South at table 2.) Similar arrangements apply if there are more than two teams in the competition. Depending on the number of teams competing and the structure of the tournament, a relatively larger number of boards may be played in each round of the movement (usually six to eight for &quot;Swiss teams&quot;, usually 12, 24, or more for knockout events). The boards are moved (sometimes by a caddy) so that they are all eventually played at both tables (or more if there are four teams or more).

Suppose Team A plays Team B. The first time a hand is played, one partnership from Team A (say) takes the North-South cards and one partnership from Team B takes the East-West cards; when the hand is played again, it is played by the other two partnerships, but this time with Team A holding the East-West cards and Team B holding the North-South cards. Of course the teams may not discuss the deals between the two plays. Normally, each of the two tables deals and plays half of the scheduled boards at the beginning of the match, and they are exchanged halfway through the match. (If there are more than two teams, the movement is more complicated.) After each deal has been played twice, the scores for each deal are compared, and a net score is given depending on the net total score from the two times the deal was played. For example, if one pair scores +620 on a deal, and their teammates score -600, then the team&#x27;s net score on that deal is +20.

Several forms of scoring are then used to calculate the overall winner of the match with IMP scoring and Board-a-match (resembling matchpoint scoring) being the most common.
* At IMP scoring, the net score is converted using an IMPs table that &quot;compresses&quot; big differences in score. For instance if the net score was 20, as in the above example, this would be converted to a score of 1 IMP, while a net score of say 450 (e.g. +620 versus +170) is worth 10 IMPs. If the match between the two teams is part of a larger competition, then usually the total difference in IMPs in a single match is again converted into so-called Victory Points or VPs. The VPs awarded to each team in their matches are summed up to determine the overall team ranking.
* At Board-a-match (BAM), each hand has equal weight; each hand is won, lost, or tied.

Also used are:
* Total point score, known as aggregate scoring in England, uses no conversion whatsoever; total-point scoring was more popular in the past, and is rarely used today. Only one event in England, the Hubert Phillips Bowl for Mixed Pivot teams, uses this form of scoring. Similarly, there is one event in Wales, the Cambria Cup for Mixed Pivot Teams. 
* Patton scoring combines the methods of Board-a-match and Total point scoring. 

===Individual events===
In an individual event, each player is paired with a different partner in each round. Individual events are less popular and much less common than pairs and teams events.

There are various methods for assigning partners. In one method, which can be regarded as an extension of the Mitchell movement, a given set of players always sit North, another set sit South, another set sit East, and a final set always sit West. This can be used to arrange that each pair consists of a relatively experienced or skilled player, and a relatively inexperienced player.

Individual events are more complex to run, as the movement and scoring are more complicated. They ideally require that players establish understandings in bidding and play methods with new partners in every round; this adds to the challenge of the game given the nuances of many bidding and signaling systems and conventions. There is an additional element of luck compared to other types of events: a good player may be less successful with a poor partner on a difficult board than others are with the same partner on a simpler one.

Scoring is usually match points, but IMP pairs scoring can be used.

==Scoring==
===Scoring and tactics===
The type of scoring significantly affects a pair&#x27;s (or team&#x27;s) tactics. For example, at matchpoints, making one more overtrick than everybody else on a board gives the same result (the top) as making a slam that nobody else bid, whereas at IMP scoring, the difference comes down to 1 IMP (30 points) in the first case, but 11 or 13 IMPs (500 or 750 points) in the second case. In general, matchpoint scoring requires a more &quot;vivid&quot; and risk-taking approach, while IMP scoring requires a more cautious approach. People that dislike IMP scoring sometimes refer to it as &quot;cowardly&quot;, while people that dislike matchpoint scoring sometimes refer to it as &quot;not bridge&quot;. The main features of the tactics are:
* Matchpoints
** Overtricks are important.
** Safety play is often neglected in the hunt for overtricks.
** Thin games and slams are avoided.
** Sacrifices are more frequent; e.g. going down 500 points on a doubled contract is a good result if the opponents can score 620 points for a game.
** Penalty doubles are more frequent, as they increase the score for the penalty. For example, &quot;the magic 200&quot; refers to the situation when a vulnerable pair&#x27;s contract is doubled and goes one down — the score of 200 will outscore almost all part-score contracts played at other tables.
** Playing in higher-scoring denominations (notrump or major suits) is important, as it may lead to an extra 10 or 20 points.
** Due to the above, it is often unclear to the defence, and sometimes even to declarer, what their goals are. Thus mastering matchpoints play requires additional skills (sometimes referred to as &quot;not bridge&quot; by those who dislike it) to those required to play IMPs.
* IMPs
** Overtricks are not important, and it is not worth a significant risk of losing a game bonus of 300–500 points = 8–11 IMPs (or to a lesser extent a part score of 110 to 190) for the potential 1 IMP gain for an overtrick.
** Safety play is very important, for the same reason.
** Thin games and slams are often bid. Bidding a game with 40 percent probability of success vulnerable and 45 percent nonvulnerable, or a small slam with 50 percent probability, is worth the risk, and anything over that increases the probability of a positive IMP score in the long run.
** Sacrifices are less frequent, as they may be risky and the relative gain can be less. Conceding -500 points rather than -620 if you might have got the opponents down for +100 is less worthwhile. However, if you can hold the penalty to -100, this is attractive.
** Penalty doubles are less frequent, as they may be risky. Often, when an opponents&#x27; contract is doubled, it turns declarer&#x27;s attention to the bad lie of cards, and may induce him to take a successful line of play that he would not take otherwise.
** The contract itself sets a clear goal for both the defence and declarer, frequently allowing a deeper level of counter-plays between them.

===Contrast with rubber bridge===
Duplicate bridge, especially matchpoint games, differs significantly from rubber bridge in scoring technique, and therefore occasionally somewhat in tactics for bidding and play. Whereas the goal in rubber bridge is to win more points than the pair of people you are playing against, in duplicate bridge the goal is to do better than other pairs playing exactly the same cards. Because of this, strategies are different. In rubber (as in IMP scoring), 30 points above the line for an overtrick is unimportant and hardly worth risking a set. In match-points duplicate, it is common for those 30 points to mean you get a top score instead of average – and may be worth risking going down. In rubber, an occasional 800-point penalty is disastrous, but in matchpoints it is no worse than any other bottom score. International match points is in the middle of these extremes. Huge penalties are worse than small penalties, but 30 point differences are only moderately important.

A more subtle difference is in the bidding of partscore hands. In duplicate bridge, once a pair recognizes that they are playing for part score (less than a game), their objective is to win the auction with the minimum bid. In rubber bridge, it may occasionally be desirable to bid above this minimum as points below the line may be needed to complete a game.

Duplicate bridge also has the unique advantage of largely neutralizing a run of bad luck with the cards because a pair that has had poor hands all night may still have the highest score for the sessionas long as they play their cards more skillfully than the other pairs with the same poor hands. That said, in such cases these pairs will probably have had fewer opportunities to exercise those skills, and their results may depend more heavily on the expertise of their opponents.

== Governance ==
=== Organization ===
The worldwide sports governing body in bridge is the World Bridge Federation, formed 1958 as the joint effort of delegates from Europe, the United States, and South America. In world bridge , Europe and North America, or the EBL and ACBL, are the two largest of eight world Zones or zonal organizations, with about 400,000 and 160,000 registered players.

Registered European players are members of a National Bridge Federation such as the English Bridge Union or the Deutscher Bridge Verband. The NBFs in turn are members of the zonal EBL, which has 49 member &quot;nations&quot; in 2010. In North America the zonal ACBL is an organization of player members. For world competition, however, the ACBL &quot;members&quot; are the NBFs of Canada, Mexico, and the US, which operate a few tournaments that qualify national representatives to some world events.

The ACBL charters more than 300 Units associated with exclusive territories. They are independent organizations that operate some tournaments and promote bridge locally. ACBL members are considered members of Units determined by residence. North America is also divided into 25 Districts that operate some Regional meets. Players may also be members of clubs that operate some bridge competition sanctioned by the ACBL.

===Rules===
The rules for playing duplicate bridge are formally titled &quot;The Laws of Duplicate Bridge&quot; and are issued by the World Bridge Federation and its member governing bodies. The Laws are designed to define correct procedure and to provide an adequate remedy when there is a departure from correct procedure. They are primarily designed not as punishment for irregularities but rather for the rectification of situations where nonoffenders may otherwise be damaged.

While the majority of primary rules are universal in application, authority to prescribe certain rules, procedures, and requirements of competition and participation are delegated to local governing bodies down to and including the club level.

<text>The International Suppliers Network is a system that logs and tracks vendors. Major companies such as General Motors often use the ISN to establish the &quot;trustworthy&quot; status of a new vendor. The ISN also allows companies to import a validated version of a vendor&#x27;s details directly into their own procurement system.

Companies that have an ISN Profile automatically are issued with an ISN Rating, which is a rating of a company&#x27;s stability and ability to manage its business. This made the ISN profile a good International identifier. General ratings range from -10 to 10, with a default value of 1. This is based on a number of key criteria, such as financial stability, and trading history performance.

The ISN is regulated by the International Charter organization.

<text>The Sierra Leone national football team represents Sierra Leone in association football and is governed by the Sierra Leone Football Association. It has qualified for Africa Cup of Nations three times.

==History==
Sierra Leone&#x27;s first match was at home on 10 August 1949 against another British colony, Nigeria, and was lost 2–0. In 1954 it played another British colony and British administered U.N trust territory, Gold Coast and Trans-Volta Togoland, and lost 2–0 away. On 22 April 1961, it hosted Nigeria and lost 4–2. On 12 November 1966, it hosted Liberia in its first match against a non-British colony and earned its first draw, 1–1. A week later, it lost 2–0 in Liberia. On 13 January 1971, it played its first match against a non-African team, West Germany&#x27;s B-team. The match in Sierra Leone was won 1–0 by the Germans. Sierra Leone&#x27;s first match outside Africa was its first against an Asian nation, China. It lost 4–1 in China on 5 April 1974.

In August 2014, Sierra Leone FA cancelled all association football matches in an effort to stop the spread of the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone, a week after Liberian FA did the same. Sierra Leonean players playing outside Sierra Leone, such as Michael Lahoud playing in the United States, were discriminated against, with opposition players refusing to swap shirts, shake hands and allow them to certain places of the stadium because they fear that they could be carrying the disease. The Sierra Leonean national team wasn&#x27;t allowed to play home games and all players had to be foreign-based.

<text>Mary Ella Dignam (Born Mary Ella Williams; 1857–1938) was a Canadian painter, teacher, and art organizer best remembered as the founder and first president of the Women&#x27;s Art Association of Canada (WAAC).

==Life==

Mary Ella Williams was born in Port Burwell, Canada West, on 13 January 1857. She studied art at the Western School of Art and Design in London, Ontario. In 1886 she went to New York City to further her training at the Art Students League, followed by time in Paris, France, at the artist&#x27;s workshop run by Raphaël Collin (1850–1916) and Luc-Olivier Merson (1846–1920).

In 1886, Dignam founded the Women&#x27;s Art Club, which later evolved into the WAAC. During her presidency (1887-1913, 1935-1938), Dignam was the driving force behind production of the Cabot Commemorative State Dinner Service. This was a hand-painted eight-course, 24-place dinner set representing Canadian subjects that had been made by WAAC members to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot&#x27;s discovery of Canada.

Following her return to Canada in 1891, she taught at a ladies&#x27; art school in Toronto, Ontario and later organized the first Art Studios of Moulton Ladies&#x27; College at McMaster University. In 1898, Dignam and Lady Edgar, wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, arranged for members of the House and Senate to subscribe $1,000 to purchase the service, which was formally presented to Lady Aberdeen on the occasion of her husband finishing his assignment as Governor General of Canada. She later helped organize the &quot;International Society of Women Painters and Sculptors&quot; and in 1900, founded the first all-women international art exhibition calling on Women&#x27;s Art Association members &amp; Women&#x27;s International Art.

Dignam was a member of the Art Association of Montreal (1886-1931), the Ontario Society of Artists (1883-1912), the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (1883-1924), and the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (1891-1900). She was also a member of the New Society of Artists in London.
Her works were exhibited across Canada and New York, London, and Paris. Dignam exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

==Death==

She died 6 September 1938 in Toronto, Ontario.

<text>Fontenay-le-Comte (; Poitevin: &quot;Funtenaes&quot; or &quot;Fintenè&quot;) is a commune and subprefecture in the Vendée department in the Pays de la Loire region of Western France. In 2018, it had a population of 13,302, while its functional area had a population of 41,273.

==Geography==
The river Vendée flows through the town. The town has an area of .

==History==
Fontenay was in existence as early as the time of the Gauls. The affix of comte is said to have been applied to it when it was taken by King Louis IX from the family of Lusignan and given to his brother Alphonse, count of Poitou, under whom it became capital of Bas-Poitou. Ceded to the Plantagenets by the Treaty of Brétigny, in 1360 it was retaken in 1372 by Duguesclin. It suffered repeated capture during the Religious Wars of the 16th century, was dismantled in 1621 and was occupied both by the Republicans and the Royalist Vendeans during the Revolt in the Vendée (1793). From 1790 to 1806 it was capital of the Vendée department.

==Population==
==Miscellaneous==
At Maison Laval on rue Rabelais, a townhouse built at the end of the 18th Century, Emperor Napoleon 1st and his wife, Joséphine, spent the night of 7–8 August 1808. On their way from Rochefort to Nantes, they had stopped off in the Bas-Poitou capital of Fontenay-le-Comte where they were the guests of Mayor Laval who, to give them a dignified welcome, had prepared a triumphal arch over the Pont Neuf bridge. That night, the Emperor learned of the defeat of General Dupont at Bailem. The General&#x27;s surrender, which seriously compromised the French army&#x27;s position in Spain, threw the Emperor into a deep rage. If word is to be believed, the Emperor smashed an earthenware vase placed in front of him.

<doc id="1145035" wikidata="Q7369187" url="?curid=1145035" title="Ross Bay Cemetery">
<text>Ross Bay Cemetery is located at 1516 Fairfield Road in Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island, Canada. Many historical figures from the early days of the province and colony of British Columbia are buried at Ross Bay.

==History==
The cemetery was opened in late 1872, with the first burial being Mary Letitia (Pemberton) Pearse, wife of Benjamin Pearse. The 27.5 acre (111,000 m2) cemetery is part of a public park and its south side faces Ross Bay on the Pacific Ocean. It is named after its owner, Isabella Mainville Ross, the first registered independent woman landowner in British Columbia. Isabella was also Indigenous, an Anishinaabe and French Métis woman, which makes her accomplishment even more remarkable. Her Métis son, Alexander Ross, was buried in the cemetery in 1876. His grave marker is the only known original marker left in possession of the Old Cemeteries Society. The old wooden marker is still used as a model for heritage markers. Isabella Ross was buried across the path from Alexander in 1885. In 1994, the Old Cemeteries Society marked Isabella&#x27;s grave with a heritage marker, styled after the one she chose for Alexander.

In 1911, a sea wall had to be constructed because of the severe erosion that occurred as a result of the relentless pounding of the ocean&#x27;s waves. During the 1930s, the City began planting a large number of trees and today the cemetery is quite different from the original that was mainly barren ground.

The Victorian-style Ross Bay Cemetery, contains numerous elaborate mausoleums and tall pillars from the early elite. Because the city of Victoria is the capital of the province of British Columbia, until the second quarter of the 20th century when improved ferry service and air travel made mobility to and from the island much easier, most senior politicians made Victoria their permanent home. As such, Ross Bay Cemetery is the burial site for many of the province&#x27;s premiers.

Although the Ross Bay Cemetery had long been considered full, the City of Victoria discovered approximately 270 unused plots in the cemetery in the late 1990s. Through a lottery process the City of Victoria sold seven of these plots in April 2004,
 and an additional 65 plots in February 2007.
The money raised through the plot sales was used to fund refurbishment work at the Ross Bay Cemetery.

<text>Beta Ray Bill is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Debuting in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the character was initially intended to be a surprise; an apparent monster who unexpectedly turns out to be a great hero. As such, Bill is the first being outside the Marvel Universe&#x27;s Norse pantheon to be introduced as being worthy to wield Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjolnir. After an initial rivalry with Thor for possession of the weapon, the alien warrior was granted a war hammer of his own, called Stormbreaker, and the two reconciled as staunch allies, going on to fight side by side.

Beta Ray Bill has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products, such as animated television series, video games, and merchandise.

==Publication history==
Beta Ray Bill debuted in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #337 (November 1983), being established as an alien of the Korbinite race.

Bill was created by Walt Simonson as a new concept for the title &quot;Thor&quot;. Simonson said,

During a &quot;Thor Spotlight&quot; panel at the Baltimore Comic Con, August 28, 2010, Simonson further stated:

The character&#x27;s introduction continued in &quot;Thor&quot; vol. 1 #338–340. He continued to make appearances in &quot;Thor&quot; sporadically. He appeared in the &quot;Maximum Security&quot; crossover in January 2001 and the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; crossover in 2008. He starred in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill&quot; and its two follow-ups, the one-shot &quot;Beta Ray Bill: The Green of Eden&quot; and three-issue &quot;Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter&quot;. A &quot;Beta Ray Bill&quot; mini-series was published in 2021 with a confrontation with Fin Fang Foom.

==Fictional character biography==

===1980s===
Spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D. detected an alien fleet passing through Earth&#x27;s galaxy, with Director Nick Fury asking Thor to investigate. Thor encounters the advance ship, &quot;Skuttlebutt&quot;, which perceives him to be a threat. Unable to stop Thor, the sentient ship revives Beta Ray Bill, who is in suspended animation. Bill battles Thor to a standstill, until the ship reaches the Solar system, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir comes into effect, which means that Thor will revert to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than 60 seconds; the hammer converts to a cane. Thor and Mjolnir become separated, causing the transformation. Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake&#x27;s cane and, upon striking it, transforms it to Mjolnir. Bill receives Thor&#x27;s power and a variant of his costume.

Once &quot;Skuttlebutt&quot; arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse gods, Odin, who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill&#x27;s origin is revealed. Bill&#x27;s race, the Korbinites, were almost rendered extinct when their galaxy exploded. The remnants of the Korbinite race fled in a fleet of warships, guarded by a sentient ship called &quot;Skuttlebutt&quot; and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbinite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an indigenous wild beast (a process that killed all of Bill&#x27;s predecessors). &quot;Skuttlebutt&quot; attacked Thor because the ship recognized the Asgardian magic as similar to that of the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbinites were being threatened once again.

On discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the fiery Asgardian realm of Skartheim to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other unconscious. Bill&#x27;s resistance to heat allows him to recover first, however, and he is deemed the winner—but he also saves Thor from falling into lava, believing he is too worthy an opponent to die, but he feels he needs the hammer to protect his people. After Bill reconsiders his claim to the hammer, Odin orders the making of a new hammer for Bill: Stormbreaker, equal in power to Mjolnir and created from the same metal and by the same dwarfs led by Eitri. Odin also transfers an enchantment from Mjolnir to Stormbreaker, so that Bill can return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the ground—and Thor can no longer become Donald Blake. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill&#x27;s people was caused by the fire demon Surtur, one of Asgard&#x27;s most powerful enemies, Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.

Bill leads many of Earth&#x27;s heroes against Surtur&#x27;s forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor&#x27;s adopted brother Loki confront Surtur in Asgard. Surtur is eventually defeated, but apparently kills Odin when they both fall through a mystic portal. Bill remains on Earth, aiding the spaceknight Rom against the threat of the alien Dire Wraiths and foes such as Iron Man opponent Titanium Man.

Forming an attachment with the Asgardian goddess Sif, Bill aids Thor against the Dark Elf Kurse in a two-part storyline before returning to his people.

===1990s===
Bill remains a staunch ally of Thor and Asgard before featuring in a storyline involving a creation of Galactus, Tyrant. Bill also features in the storyline &quot;Blood and Thunder&quot;, attempting, alongside Adam Warlock, Thanos and others, to deal with the &quot;warrior madness&quot; of Thor through which he is trying to destroy the universe, although at one point he is struck with enough force to destroy a planet. Together with Thor, Bill joins with other versions of the Thunder God in the &quot;Thor Corps&quot; against the entity Demonstaff. and has several cosmic adventures.

===2000s===
Bill also participates in a battle between the heroes of Earth and several alien races such as the Kree, Shi&#x27;ar, and Z&#x27;Nox. and after several adventures with Thor guest starring in the final storyline, when Thor—determined to end the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth the Asgardians are trapped in—brings about Ragnarök (in Norse mythology this event means the end of Asgard and its gods, as they die in battle against the armies of evil). Although Bill attempts to aid the Asgardians, Thor teleports Bill away as it is not his destiny to die in Ragnarök.

Bill visits his people&#x27;s new homeworld, where he is attacked by his insane predecessor, &quot;Alpha Ray&quot;, defeating him just as the cosmic entity Galactus and his herald Stardust arrive. Despite Bill&#x27;s efforts, Galactus consumes the world and almost kills him, with Bill drifting in space until recovered by &quot;Skuttlebutt&quot;. After finding an orb containing the souls of many of the Korbinites, Bill revisits a desolate Asgard, and joins forces with Stardust to battle a new demonic menace named &quot;Asteroth&quot;.

Although victorious, Bill is mortally wounded, and while near death is healed by an unknown entity that also claims the remaining souls in the orb. Placed in the recently deceased body of a war veteran named &quot;Simon Walters&quot; (a reference to his creator, Walt Simonson) on Earth, Bill has a brief encounter with the villain &quot;Boar&quot; and the hero Spider-Man. Bill eventually finds and joins Canadian superhero team &quot;Omega Flight&quot; against the supervillain team the Wrecking Crew, who release the supernatural Great Beasts. The battle ends with Bill and the Beasts trapped in an alternate dimension.

During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Bill is wounded and captured by the alien Skrulls, who bestow his hammer Stormbreaker on a warrior Super-Skrull called the &quot;Godkiller&quot;. Thor rescues Bill, although Loki starts a rumor that Bill may be a Skrull, causing some Asgardians to go against him despite Balder telling them to stop. Thor throws Mjolnir at Bill, who catches it, proving he really is Bill. After being nursed back to health, the character retrieves his hammer. Although the Godkiller defeats him, with Thor&#x27;s help, he tricks the Godkiller, causing Asgard to fall onto it, killing the Skrull. Thor and Bill then raise the city again.

Bill decides to hunt the cosmic entity Galactus, to avenge the destruction of the Korbinites&#x27; second homeworld, and the seeming eradication of his species. After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the Silver Surfer, who is puzzled by the Korbinite&#x27;s apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character&#x27;s obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy. Equipped with alien weapons, Bill finds Galactus but discovers the entity already under attack by another race. In a moment of conscience, Bill saves Galactus. The grateful entity rewards Bill by creating a Korbinite mate for him, with Bill also regaining the ability to wield Stormbreaker.

===2010s===
When the universe is invaded during &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; storyline, Beta Ray Bill joins Cosmo&#x27;s select group to travel across the Fault and into the Cancerverse. Bill is recruited by Cosmo to join the Annihilators, a new super-group intended to replace the fallen Guardians of the Galaxy. The Annihilators defend Galador from the Dire Wraiths, resulting in a peace between the two groups who have been at war for generations. Later, when trying to end a conflict between warring factions of the Universal Church of Truth, the Annihilators are transported to a Church base on Earth and come into conflict with the Avengers.

During the &quot;Death of the Inhumans&quot; miniseries, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members ask for Beta Ray Bill to help to confront the Kree and their Super-Inhuman Vox as well as rescuing Black Bolt from them. Beta Ray Bill agreed to help them. When they reach the location where Black Bolt is being attacked by Vox, Beta Ray Bill helps Black Bolt, and takes down Vox, who is revealed to be a brainwashed Maximus. He and the Inhuman Royal Family witness something on the Vox costume teleport Crystal away while also killing Maximus.

When Thor became unworthy of Mjolnir after Nick Fury whispered a secret to him, Thor spent months drinking and fighting to avoid thinking about his loss. Bill eventually came to visit Thor- now calling himself &#x27;Odinson&#x27;- and offered his old friend Stormbreaker instead, only for Odinson and Bill to be captured by the Collector as they examined the remains of Asgard where the hammer of an alternate version of Thor had recently crashed. Although the Collector tried to force Odinson to help him find some means of bypassing the worthiness enchantment so that he could lift the hammer himself, Odinson eventually escaped and used the hammer&#x27;s power to return Asgard to its original place. Once free, Odinson told Bill that the secret Fury had shared with him was &quot;Gorr was right&quot;, a reference to Thor&#x27;s old foe Gorr the God Butcher who believed that all gods brought nothing but pain and suffering to the universe. However, Bill assured Odinson that, regardless of his ability to wield Mjolnir, even if the gods were not worthy, Odinson proved himself to be a hero as he continued to fight for humanity even when officially unworthy.

===2020s===
Due to a misunderstanding, a battle between Bill and a cosmically powered All-Father Thor results in Stormbreaker being destroyed. To compensate for the loss of Stormbreaker, Thor appoints Bill as an advisor and allows him unrestricted access to Asgard&#x27;s armory. 

Bill falls into depression as Stormbreaker&#x27;s destruction prevents him from transforming back into his unaltered Korbinite form. After suffering numerous defeats without its powers, Bill departs Asgard on Skuttlebutt to search for a replacement. Accompanied by Skurge and Pip the Troll, Bill encounters Odin who is unable to provide Bill with a weapon that can fix his transformation but cautiously suggests Surtur&#x27;s resurfaced Twilight Sword as a suitable replacement. Bill and his allies venture into the deepest level of Muspelheim, where Bill claims Twilight and uses it to slay Surtur and revert to his unaltered form.

==Powers and abilities==

Beta Ray Bill&#x27;s life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg. Courtesy of highly advanced genetic engineering and cyborg implants, Beta Ray Bill possesses vast superhuman strength, speed, stamina and durability, and a highly extended lifespan. Beta Ray Bill is also a superior hand-to-hand combatant. His combat prowess is such that he was able to fight Thor (noted as one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the Marvel Universe) to a standstill.

Beta Ray Bill&#x27;s weapon, Stormbreaker, has the same properties as Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjolnir, including its ability to transform into a cane when struck upon the ground and return Bill to his unaltered Korbinite form.

Beta Ray Bill has a partner in the form of a Korbinite sentient warship named Skuttlebutt. The same technology that transferred Bill&#x27;s consciousness into his cyborg body was also used to transfer an unknown Korbinite&#x27;s consciousness into a large combat cruiser retrofitted with medical, cargo, and humanitarian equipment and facilities to accommodate the attempt to transport Bill&#x27;s people off planet to avoid the incoming attack by Galactus. Skuttlebutt often uses his medical facilities to repair Bill&#x27;s tissue and implants from damage after battles. Skuttlebutt can also create a female humanoid avatar of itself. 

After Stormbreaker&#x27;s destruction, Beta Ray Bill replaces it with the Twilight Sword, which can generate the flames of Muspelheim. Much like with Stormbreaker, Twilight also has the ability to return Bill to his unaltered Korbinite form.

Bill attacks everyone present until Odin subdues him. Realizing his mistake, Bill reveals he has the ability to read the auras of others; through this ability, he mistook the Asgardians as enemies due to them sharing the exact same auras as Surtur&#x27;s demons.

<text>Villefranche-sur-Mer (, ; ; ) is a resort town in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region on the French Riviera and is located southwest of the Principality of Monaco, which is just west of the French-Italian border.

==Geography==
Villefranche-sur-Mer is immediately to the east of the city of Nice, along Mont Boron, Mont Alban and Mont Vinaigrier, and southwest of Monaco. The bay (&quot;rade&quot;) of Villefranche is one of the deepest natural harbours of any port in the Mediterranean Sea and provides safe anchorage for large ships from easterly winds. Reaching depths of between the Cape of Nice and Cap Ferrat, it extends to the south to form a abyss known as the undersea Canyon of Villefranche about off the coastline. The Bay is the place where the United States Sixth Fleet moors when cruising the Mediterranean coast.

The city limits extend to the hills surrounding the bay climbing from sea level to an altitude of , the highest point of Mont-Leuze, reflecting on land the features found offshore. The Basse Corniche runs through Vlllefranche with the Moyenne Corniche above and the Haute Corniche above that entering the farthest reach to the west of the Alpes-Maritimes.

==History==
The site of what is now Villefranche and surrounding Beaulieu-sur-Mer and Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat has been settled since prehistoric times. Celto-ligurian tribes roamed the area and established farming communities on the surrounding hills. The Greeks and later the Romans used the natural harbour as a stop-over en route to the Greek settlements around the Western Mediterranean. After the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar, the Romans built an extension of the Via Aurelia (Aurelian Way), which passed through the settlement of Montolivo.

By the fall of the Carolingian Empire, the area was part of Lotharingia and later part of the County of Provence. In 1295, Charles II, Duke of Anjou, then Count of Provence, enticed the inhabitants of Montolivo and surroundings to settle closer to the coastline in order to secure the area from pirates. By charter, he established Villefranche as a &quot;free port&quot;, thus the name, granting tax privileges and port fee rights that lasted well into the 18th century.

By 1388, East Provence became part of the Duchy of Savoy as a result of the disputed succession to the heirless Queen Joan I of Naples. For the next 400 years, the area known as the County of Nice was hotly disputed between the Holy Roman Empire to which Savoy was an ally and the French.

In 1543, the Franco-Turkish armies sacked and occupied the city after the siege of Nice, prompting Duke Emmanuel Philibert to secure the site by building an impressive citadel and a fort on nearby Mont Alban. In the late 17th century, the area fell to the French but was returned to Savoy after the Peace of Utrecht.

During the 18th century, the city lost some of its maritime importance to the new harbour being built in Nice but remained a military and naval base. In 1744, a Franco-Spanish army under the Prince of Conti overran the Piedmontese regiments of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia at the Fort of Mont Alban in the heights above the town.

In 1793, the French returned to re-occupy Villefranche and the county of Nice remained part of the Napoleonic Empire until 1814. It was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna.

In 1860, as a consequence of the Risorgimento, it was given to France by treaty following a plebiscite.

By the late 19th century, it had become an important Imperial Russian Navy base and the Russians established an oceanographic laboratory in the old lazaret.

The site was also the winter residence for royalty and wealthy visitors.

Villefranche&#x27;s bay is notable for reaching a significant depth only a short distance from shore. As a result, it has become an important port over the years. Since World War I, the United States Navy has called on a regular basis, making Villefranche the home port of the U.S. 6th Fleet from 1948 to February 1966, when French President Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO and required U.S. forces to leave. Just prior to 1966, the flagship of the Commander Sixth Fleet rotated between and . Since the 1980s Villefranche has been used by cruise ships. It is the most visited cruise ship port of call in France.

==Population==

Villefranche is now part of the Urban community of Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur and so can be considered a suburb of the Nice metropolitan area. The decrease in population in recent years and especially in the 1990s can be attributed to the cost of real estate and an increase of part-time residents, who typically are not counted in the census. But Villefranche&#x27;s aging population, like elsewhere in the eastern part of the Alpes-Maritimes, is not being replaced by younger people at the same rate as in the rest of the département.

==Economy==
The main activity remains tourism, with hotels and restaurants employing a sizeable portion of the population. Traditional activities, like fishing, have now given way to sea-related activities, such as sailing and deep sea diving. Some dockyard activity remains at the harbour of “la Darse” but most of it has now been moved to Antibes.
Residential construction and maintenance, which provided a lot of employment in the mid 20th century, has now subsided considerably.

==Places of interest==

===Churches and chapels===

*&quot;Église Saint-Michel&quot; (Saint Michael&#x27;s Church) in the heart of old town, was built in the 1750s in the baroque Italian-style where originally stood a more modest early fourteenth century church. It houses various works of art, notably a large Saint Michael painting above the marble main altar, a recumbent sculpture Christ (18th century) known as the &quot;Christ of the Galleys&quot; and a polychrome wooden statue of San Rocco. The organ built by the Grinda Brothers in 1790 is one of the oldest of the County of Nice still in operation. The building was included in the French Historic Sites Registry in 1990.
*The &quot;Chapelle Saint-Pierre &quot; (Saint Peter&#x27;s Chapel) dates from the sixteenth century. Used as a storeroom for local fishermen&#x27;s nets and equipment for most of the 19th and early part of the 20th century, it was restored in 1957 with Jean Cocteau adding his now-famous murals depicting the life of the saint and of local fishermen. The building was included in the French Historic Sites Registry in 1995.

==Public collections==

*The Figures, Delta Book of Gabriel Méxène, 2015 (Eight engraved, gilded and painted stones) Collections of the citadel museums. The Delta Book, known as the &quot;Dragon Book of Piedmont-Savoy&quot;, contains 1400 Roman capital letters engraved by hand on Tavel marble.

==Other public buildings==
*The old harbour of la Darse dates back to the 17th century. Built originally for the galleys of the Duke of Savoy, it is now a marina with dockyard activities for yachts. It is also the site of the oceanographic observatory Observatoire Oceanologique de Villefranche of the Pierre and Marie Curie University of Paris and of the French National Centre for Scientific Research with 3 laboratories (oceanology, marine geoscience and cell biology) and 150 personnels attached to it. Buildings and structures surrounding the harbour are also included in the French Historic Sites Registry since 1991.
*The Citadel built in 1557 now houses the Town Hall, a convention centre, three museums and an open-air theatre.
*The or “Dark Street” is a passageway under the harbour front houses which dates back to 1260.
*The Villa Léopolda on the hills surrounding was once the residence of King Leopold II of Belgium and has been tagged as “the most expensive house in the world”..

==Gallery==
===Public beaches===
*Plage des Marinières is the main beach and is located at the north end of the bay. It stretches for under the track of the railway line linking Nice to Italy.
*Plage de la Darse is a smaller pebble beach located behind the main jetty of the harbour of La Darse.

==Media==
The old town and the bay have offered for years a natural set for movie makers. Among many productions to name just a few:

*Raoul Walsh’s &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.&quot;
* &quot;Adventures of Captain Fabian&quot; with Errol Flynn
* Alfred Hitchcock’s &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;
* &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; with Louis Jourdan

Villefranche-sur-Mer is also a harbour for visiting naval forces and particularly US Navy ships.

The façades of the buildings in the harbour were the inspiration for the film set in the Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular at the Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World, Florida.

It was also at Villefranche-Sur-Mer that The Rolling Stones recorded their 1972 album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, at the Belle Epoque-era mansion Nellcôte.

Some scenes in Amy Plum&#x27;s &quot;Revenants&quot; trilogy take place in Villefranche-sur-Mer.

<text>The Florida Midland Railway Company was incorporated under the general incorporation laws of Florida, and surveyed a line from Lake Jessup, in Orange County, to Leesburg, in Lake County.

==History==
The company was reincorporated on February 10, 1885; only had been graded. The new owners were E. W. Henck, S. M. Breuster, Carl Cushing, A. Menser and C. E. Munson of Florida, and Edward Page, Charles W. Morris and Cyrus Carpenter of Boston, Massachusetts.

The line was extended

Land grants were promised, as long as part of the railroad was completed within a year.

Florida state law chapter 3795, approved June 2, 1887, expanded the area from which land grants could be chosen, and extended the deadline to June 1, 1888.

The line actually built was rather different, running from Clifton on Lake Jesup west to Apopka, but then turning south to Kissimmee.

The railroad&#x27;s track was while it was independent, but when it was taken over by the Plant System in the late 1890s, all track north of the narrow gauge section of the Sanford and St. Petersburg Railroad (also taken over by the Plant System) was abandoned and the remaining trackage from Clarcona to Kissimmee was converted to narrow gauge. The two narrow gauge lines were run in conjunction with one another, allowing the usage of the same narrow gauge equipment on both lines. The Plant System became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system in 1902.

==Current conditions==

From Clifton to Apopka, the railroad has been abandoned for over 100 years. Virtually no trace of this section remains, but parts of the right-of-way were used to construct SR 434.

From Apopka to Clarcona, the right-of-way is used for the West Orange Trail.

From Clarcona to Ocoee, the right-of-way is currently owned by CSX Transportation and run by the Florida Central Railroad.

From Ocoee to Kissimmee, the railroad is abandoned, and some elements remain.

==Historic stations==
These are listed from north to south.

<doc id="1145044" wikidata="Q559722" url="?curid=1145044" title="Ma Teng">
<text>Ma Teng () (died June or July 212), courtesy name Shoucheng, was a Chinese military general and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He controlled Liang Province (涼州; covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) with another warlord, Han Sui. Ma Teng and Han Sui were involved in efforts to gain autonomy from the Han central government.

==Life==
Ma Teng was born in Maoling County (), Fufeng Commandery () (present-day Xingping, Shaanxi). He was a descendant of Ma Yuan. His father, Ma Ping (), whose courtesy name was Zishuo (子碩), was a minor official in Tianshui Commandery during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han. Due to unknown reasons, he was dismissed from his post, and went to live among the Qiang people. Ma Ping&#x27;s family was poor and without connections. Therefore, he married a Qiang woman, who gave birth to Ma Teng.

Ma Teng grew up in extreme poverty and made a living selling firewood to the city markets that he collected in the mountains. He was extremely tall, more than eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately 1.84 metres), his appearance large and imposing, his face and nose majestic. He was also known to be virtuous therefore many people admired him.

In 184, towards the end of Emperor Ling&#x27;s reign, the Qiang people in Liang Province rose up against the local government under Beigong Yu () and Liwen Hou (). They were joined by members of the local gentry Han Sui and Bian Zhang. The official Han governor of Liang Province, Geng Bi (), gathered forces to put down the rebellion. He recruited among the locals, people known to be courageous and strong wishing to suppress the rebels. Ma Teng volunteered as a foot soldier.

He impressed the provincial government and local officials; therefore, he was promoted to Assistant Officer in the army, whose role was to manage the troops. His skills in battle against the rebels were further recognised and he was appointed as Major (軍司馬). For his merits, he was reassigned to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) and General Who Subdues the West (征西將軍) stationed in the Shaanxi region.

However, when Geng Bi was killed in battle by the rebel army, Ma Teng switched sides and joined Han Sui. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by the Han general Huangfu Song but Ma Teng escaped along with the rebels. In the end, the central government granted military titles to some of the rebel leaders in order to appease them.

During the &quot;Chuping&quot; era (初平; 190–193) of the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, he was appointed as General Who Subdues the East (征東將軍). He remarked that the western regions were short of food and wrote a memorial to the court, asking for further provisions. He also moved his troops eastwards. However, the local General Wang Cheng and his subordinates feared he would harm them. Therefore, they attacked his camp. Ma Teng was surprised and not ready for the sudden betrayal; he was defeated and fled westward.

When Li Jue and Guo Si seized power over Chang&#x27;an after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s assassination in May 192, Ma Teng and Han Sui at first pledged allegiance to them, and were appointed as General who Attacks the West () and General who Guards the West () respectively. However, the relationship between the two sides quickly soured, and Ma Teng and Han Sui led their armies in an attempt to seize Chang&#x27;an. They allied themselves with the warlord Liu Yan, but suffered defeats from the hands of Li Jue&#x27;s forces led by Guo Si, Fan Chou and Li Li. Not only was the loss of 10,000 soldiers a heavy blow to the morale of the allied forces, they also faced a supply shortage at the time, so the eloquent Han Sui asked Fan Chou for a private talk, during which Han Sui successfully persuaded Fan Chou to abort the pursuit because they shared the same hometown. The allied forces then retreated back to Liang Province safely.

Ma Teng was initially on good terms with Han Sui; they were said to be as close as brothers. However, as conflict arose between their respective retainers, the two went to war against each other over control of Liang Province. The fighting escalated to a point where they became sworn enemies. Once, Ma Teng forced Han Sui to flee, but the latter came back and killed Ma Teng&#x27;s wife and children. From then on, the conflict escalated.

Cao Cao, who at this point had decisively defeated Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, and had Zhong Yao along with Wei Duan (韋端) brokered peace between Ma Teng and Han Sui, who then pledged allegiance to the Han dynasty and sent troops to assist Cao Cao in defeating Yuan Shao&#x27;s successors and remnants. Ma Teng was appointed as General of the Vanguard (前將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Huaili (槐里侯).

While he was in the West, Ma Teng was known to have well defended his lands against aggressive tribes and bandits, caring for the learned scholars and promoting talented people, protected and treated generously the common people therefore he was greatly respected for his achievements.

In 208, Cao Cao wanted to conquer Jing, but feared Ma Teng&#x27;s influence in Guanzhong. He summoned Ma Teng to Ye city with most of his family and wanted them to disband their personal troops. Cao Cao sent Zhang Ji to persuade Ma Teng. As Ma Teng was still hesitant about this, Zhang Ji ordered the counties to prepare supplies for his arrival and had officials of high position sent to welcome him. Ma Teng had no choice but to go east. Already in his old age, he was appointed Minister of the Guards () while his younger sons, Ma Xiu (馬休) and Ma Tie (馬鐵), were appointed Commandant of Equipage (奉車都尉) and Commandant of Iron Cavalry (鐵騎都尉) respectively. His eldest son, Ma Chao, remained behind in Liang Province with Han Sui.

Around early 211, Cao Cao ordered Zhong Yao and Xiahou Yuan to pass through Guanzhong to attack Zhang Lu in Hanzhong. Ma Chao suspected this to be a feint to invade Liang Province. He formed a coalition with Han Sui and other minor warlords in Liang, and started a rebellion against the Han dynasty. While persuading Han Sui to join him, Ma Chao said, &quot;[...] Now, I abandon my father, and I&#x27;m willing to acknowledge you as my father. You should also abandon your son, and treat me like your son.&quot; Cao Cao defeated Ma Chao and his coalition at the Battle of Tong Pass in September 211. In June or July 212, Emperor Xian issued an imperial decree ordering the execution of Ma Teng and the rest of his family who were with him in Ye city at the time.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Ma Teng is portrayed as a loyalist of the declining Han dynasty. He participates in a plot with Liu Bei and Dong Cheng to assassinate Cao Cao, who is depicted as a villain monopolising power and holding Emperor Xian hostage. However, the plot is unsuccessful and Ma Teng returns to Liang Province.

When Ma Teng is later recalled to the imperial capital Xuchang, he decides to again join a plot to assassinate Cao Cao, this time with Huang Kui (). However, the plot is discovered and he is executed along with his sons Ma Xiu () and Ma Tie (). Upon hearing of the death of his father and brothers, Ma Chao becomes filled with rage and goes to war with Cao Cao to avenge his family, starting the Battle of Tong Pass.

== In popular culture ==
Ma Teng is a warlord and playable character in the game &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;. Ma Teng also appears in the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; games, specifically &quot;5&quot; and &quot;9&quot;.

<doc id="1145054" wikidata="Q3841718" url="?curid=1145054" title="MV Joyita">
<text>MV &quot;Joyita&quot; was an American merchant vessel from which 25 passengers and crew mysteriously disappeared in the South Pacific in October 1955. She was found adrift with no one aboard.

The ship was in very poor condition, with corroded pipes and a radio which, while functional, had a range of only about because of faulty wiring. However, the extreme buoyancy of the ship made sinking nearly impossible. Investigators were puzzled as to why the crew had not remained on board and waited for help.

==Vessel description and history==
===Construction===
MV &quot;Joyita&quot; was a wooden ship built in 1931 as a luxury yacht by the Wilmington Boat Works in Los Angeles for movie director Roland West, who named the ship for his wife, actress Jewel Carmen — &quot;joyita&quot; in Spanish meaning &quot;little jewel&quot;. In 1936 the ship was sold and registered to Milton E. Beacon. During this period, she made numerous trips south to Mexico and to the 1939–1940 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. During part of this time, Chester Mills was the captain of the vessel.

The ship&#x27;s hull was constructed of -thick cedar on oak frames. She was long, with beam of and a draft of ; her net tonnage was 47 tons and her gross tonnage approximately 70 tons. She had tanks for of water and of diesel fuel.

===U.S. Navy service in World War II===

In October 1941, two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Joyita&quot; was acquired by the United States Navy and taken to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was outfitted as yard patrol boat YP-108. The Navy used her to patrol the Big Island of Hawaii until the end of World War II.

In 1943 she ran aground and was heavily damaged, but the Navy was badly in need of ships, so she was repaired. At this point, new pipework was made from galvanized iron instead of copper or brass. In 1946, the ship was surplus to Navy requirements and most of her equipment was removed.

===Private purchase===
In 1948, &quot;Joyita&quot; was sold to the firm of Louis Brothers. At this point, cork lining was added to the ship&#x27;s hull along with refrigeration equipment. The ship had two Gray Marine diesel engines providing , and two extra diesel engines for generators. In 1950 William Tavares became the owner; however, he had little use for the vessel, and sold it in 1952 to Dr. Katharine Luomala, a professor at the University of Hawaii. She chartered the boat to her friend, Captain Thomas H. &quot;Dusty&quot; Miller, a British-born sailor living in Samoa. Miller used the ship as a trading and fishing charter boat.

==Disappearance==

About 5:00 AM on 3 October 1955, &quot;Joyita&quot; left Samoa&#x27;s Apia harbour bound for the Tokelau Islands, about away. The boat had been scheduled to leave on the noon tide the previous day but her departure was delayed because her port engine clutch failed. &quot;Joyita&quot; eventually left Samoa on one engine. She was carrying sixteen crew members and nine passengers, including a government official, a doctor (Alfred &quot;Andy&quot; Denis Parsons, a World War II surgeon on his way to perform an amputation), a copra buyer, and two children. Her cargo consisted of medical supplies, timber, 80 empty 45-gallon (200 L) oil drums, and various foodstuffs.

The voyage was expected to take between 41 and 48 hours. &quot;Joyita&quot; was scheduled to arrive in the Tokelau Islands on 5 October. On 6 October, a message from Fakaofo port reported that the ship was overdue. No ship or land-based operator reported receiving a distress signal from the crew. A search-and-rescue mission was launched and, from 6 to 12 October, Sunderlands of the Royal New Zealand Air Force covered a probability area of nearly of ocean, but no sign of &quot;Joyita&quot; or any of her passengers or crew was found.

Five weeks later, on 10 November, Gerald Douglas, captain of the merchant ship &quot;Tuvalu&quot;, en route from Suva to Funafuti, sighted &quot;Joyita&quot; more than west from her scheduled route, drifting north of Vanua Levu. The ship was partially submerged and listing heavily (her port deck rail was awash) and there was no trace of any of the passengers or crew; four tons of cargo were also missing. The recovery party noted that the radio was discovered tuned to 2182 kHz, the international marine radiotelephone distress channel.
* Barnacle growth high above the usual waterline on the port side showed that &quot;Joyita&quot; had been listing heavily for some time.
* There was some damage to the superstructure. Her flying bridge had been smashed away and the deckhouse had light damage and broken windows. A canvas awning had been rigged on top of the deckhouse behind the bridge.
* &quot;Joyita&quot; carried a dinghy and three Carley liferafts, but all were missing. She did not carry enough lifejackets for everyone on board.
* The starboard engine was found to be covered by mattresses, while the port engine&#x27;s clutch was still partially disassembled, showing that the vessel was still running on only one engine. The starter motor of the starboard auxiliary engine was also missing, indicating that this engine was unserviceable. 
* An auxiliary pump had been rigged in the engine room, mounted on a plank of wood slung between the main engines. However, it had not been connected.
* The radio on board was tuned to the international distress channel, but when the equipment was inspected, a break was found in the cable between the set and the aerial. The cable had been painted over, obscuring the break. This would have limited the range of the radio to about .
* The electric clocks on board (wired into the vessel&#x27;s generator) had stopped at 10:25 and the switches for the cabin lighting and navigation lights were on, implying that whatever had occurred happened at night. 
* The ships&#x27; logbook, sextant, mechanical chronometer and other navigational equipment, as well as the firearms Miller kept in the boat, were missing.
* A doctor&#x27;s bag was found on deck, containing a stethoscope, a scalpel, and four lengths of blood-stained bandages.

There was still fuel in &quot;Joyita&quot;″s tanks; from the amount used, it was calculated she made some before the vessel was abandoned, probably within of Tokelau. The leak had probably started after 9 p.m. on the second night of the voyage, with nine hours of darkness ahead.

Although &quot;Joyita&quot; was found with her bilges and lower decks flooded, her hull was sound and once the water was pumped from her hull she floated on a stable and even keel and was easily towed into harbour at Suva. When at her mooring there, investigators heard the sound of water entering the vessel. It was found that a pipe in the raw-water circuit of the port auxiliary engine&#x27;s cooling system had failed due to galvanic corrosion, allowing water into the bilges. The first the crew would have known about the leak was when the water rose above the engine room floorboards, by which time it would have been nearly impossible to locate the leak. Also, the bilge pumps were not fitted with strainers, and had become clogged with debris, meaning that it would have been very difficult to pump the water out.

==Maritime inquiry==
A formal inquiry into the fate of &quot;Joyita&quot; was held in Apia in February 1956. It found that the vessel was in a poor state of repair, but determined that the fate of the passengers and crew was &quot;inexplicable on the evidence submitted at the inquiry.&quot; An especially perplexing point was that the three liferafts &quot;Joyita&quot; carried were missing, but it would not make sense for the crew and passengers to voluntarily abandon the vessel. Fitted out for carrying refrigerated cargo, &quot;Joyita&quot; had of cork lining her holds, making her virtually unsinkable. In addition, further buoyancy was provided by a cargo of empty fuel drums.

The inquiry was able to establish only the reasons for the vessel becoming flooded. It found that the vessel would have begun to flood due to the fractured cooling pipe. The bilge pumps were unserviceable due to becoming blocked. &quot;Joyita&quot; lacked watertight bulkheads or subdivisions in the bilges. The water would have gradually flooded the lower decks. As the boat began to sink lower into the water, the one remaining engine would not have been able to maintain enough speed to steer. &quot;Joyita&quot; then fell beam-on to a heavy swell and took on the heavy list it was found with. While flooded to an extent which would sink a conventional vessel, &quot;Joyita&quot; stayed afloat due to her cork-lined hull and cargo of fuel drums.

The inquiry also placed much of the responsibility for the events on Captain Miller. They found him reckless for setting out on an ocean-going voyage with only one engine and numerous minor faults, and negligent for failing to provide a working radio or properly equipped lifeboat. He was also in breach of maritime law, since he had allowed &quot;Joyita&quot;″s license to carry fare-paying passengers to lapse.

The inquiry made no mention of the used medical equipment found on board.

==Hypotheses==
&quot;Joyita&quot; is sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot;Mary Celeste&quot; of the South Pacific&quot; and has been the subject of several books and documentaries offering explanations that range from rational and conventional to supernatural and paranormal. Numerous hypotheses for the disappearance of &quot;Joyita&quot;″s crew and passengers have been advanced. Many were circulated at the time of the event, and several others have been put forward since. Given the fact that the hull of &quot;Joyita&quot; was sound and her design made her almost unsinkable, a main concern of investigators was determining why the passengers and crew did not stay on board if the events were simply triggered by the flooding in the engine room.

===Injured captain hypothesis===
Captain Miller should have been well aware of the vessel&#x27;s ability to stay afloat, leading some to speculate that he had died or become incapacitated for some reason (someone on board was injured—hence the bloodstained bandages). Without him to reassure the other people on board, they may have panicked when &quot;Joyita&quot; began to flood and taken to the liferafts. However, this in itself would not account for the missing cargo and equipment, unless the vessel had been found abandoned and had her cargo removed.

A friend of Miller, Captain S. B. Brown, was convinced that Miller would never have left &quot;Joyita&quot; alive, given his knowledge of her construction. He was aware of tension between Miller and his American first mate, Chuck Simpson, and felt that their mutual dislike came to blows and both men fell overboard or were severely injured in a struggle. This left the vessel without an experienced seaman and would explain why those remaining on board would panic when the ship began to flood.

===Japanese involvement and other hypotheses===

The Fiji &quot;Times and Herald&quot; quoted at the time from an &quot;impeccable source&quot; to the effect that &quot;Joyita&quot; had passed through a fleet of Japanese fishing boats during its trip and &quot;had observed something the Japanese did not want them to see.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in London hypothesized that some still-active Japanese forces from World War II were to blame for the disappearances, operating from an isolated island base. There was still strong anti-Japanese sentiment in parts of the Pacific, and in Fiji there was specific resentment of Japan being allowed to operate fishing fleets in local waters.

Such theories suddenly gained credence when men clearing &quot;Joyita&quot; found knives stamped &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27;. However, tests on the knives proved negative and it turned out the knives were old and broken - quite possibly left on board from when &quot;Joyita&quot; was used for fishing in the late 1940s.

Also there was a proposition that &quot;the vessel&#x27;s occupants were kidnapped by a Soviet submarine, with the world at the time in the midst of the growing Cold War.&quot;

Early reports that the &quot;Joyita&quot; had been involved in a collision led to speculation that she had been rammed, and that modern sea pirates attacked the vessel, killed the 25 passengers and crew (and cast their bodies into the ocean), and stole the missing four tons of cargo.

===Insurance fraud hypothesis===
It was also revealed that Miller had amassed large debts after a series of unsuccessful fishing trips on &quot;Joyita&quot;. However, it would have been difficult to see the events surrounding &quot;Joyita&quot; as insurance fraud, given that no seacocks were found open and the ship would be almost impossible to scuttle. Also, Miller was relying on &quot;Joyita&quot; being chartered for regular runs between Samoa and Tokelau—these government charters would have quickly cleared his debts.

===Mutiny hypothesis===
A subsequent owner of &quot;Joyita&quot;, British author Robin Maugham, spent many years investigating the vessel&#x27;s past, and published his findings as &quot;The Joyita Mystery&quot; in 1962. Maugham agreed that events were started by the flooding from the broken cooling pipe and the failure of the pumps. The mattresses found covering the starboard engine were used either in an attempt to stem the leak or to protect the electrical switchboard from spray kicked up by the engine&#x27;s flywheel as the water level rose. At the same time, &quot;Joyita&quot; encountered increasingly heavy swells and squally weather.

Captain Miller, knowing &quot;Joyita&quot; to be unsinkable and desperate to reach his destination to clear his debt, pressed on. However, Simpson, and possibly other crew members, demanded that he turn back. This effectively led to mutiny and Miller and the crew struggled, during which Miller sustained a serious injury. By now the ship was entering heavier weather, with winds around , and with one engine and a flooded bilge, was beginning to labor. The flooding in the engine room would have eventually caused the starboard engine to fail, also cutting all the vessel&#x27;s electrical power. Simpson was now in control and made the decision to abandon ship, taking the navigational equipment, logbook and supplies, as well as the injured Miller, with them.

It still seems unlikely that Simpson would choose to abandon a flooded but floating ship to take to small open rafts in the Pacific Ocean. Maugham proposed that they sighted a nearby island or reef and tried to reach it, but in the strong winds and seas the rafts were carried out to sea, leaving &quot;Joyita&quot; drifting and empty. The damage to the lightly-built superstructure was caused by wave damage while the vessel was drifting in heavy seas.

==&quot;Joyita&quot; after 1955==
In July 1956, &quot;Joyita&quot; was auctioned off by her owners for £2,425 to a Fiji Islander, David Simpson (no relation to Chuck Simpson). He refitted and overhauled her and she went to sea again that year. However, she was surrounded by legal disputes over the transfer of her registry from the United States to Britain without permission. In January 1957 she ran aground while carrying thirteen passengers in the Koro Sea. She was repaired and in October 1958 began a regular trade between Levuka and Suva.

&quot;Joyita&quot; again ran aground on a reef in November 1959 at Vatuvalu near Levuka. She floated off the reef assisted by high tide, but while heading for port began to take in water through a split seam. The pumps were started, but it became clear that the valves for the pump had been installed the wrong way round, meaning that water was pumped into the hull, not out. Now with a reputation as an &#x27;unlucky ship&#x27; and with a damaged hull, she was abandoned by her owners and beached. She was stripped of useful equipment and was practically a hulk when she was bought by Maugham. He sold the hulk in 1966 to Major J. Casling-Cottle, who ran a tourist and publicity bureau at Levuka. The Major planned to turn it into a museum and tearoom, but the plan never saw daylight. The hulk disappeared piece by piece and the process of disintegration appears to have been complete by the late 1970s.

On 14 March 1975, the Western Samoa Post Office released a set of five stamps dealing with the mystery of &quot;Joyita&quot;.

In 2009, a walkway was named after Dr Alfred Dennis Parsons near his former Torbay home in Auckland, New Zealand. In 2012, two memory stones in honor of the event were erected in Apia, Samoa and in Fakaofo Village, Tokelau.

== Crew and passengers ==
, all aboard were still declared as &quot;missing&quot;. In 2012 there was a call for a formal declaration that they were dead.

<doc id="1145057" wikidata="Q529855" url="?curid=1145057" title="Sophie Pemberton">
<text>Sophia Theresa &quot;Sophie&quot; Pemberton (13 February 1869 - 31 October 1959) was a Canadian painter who was British Columbia&#x27;s first professional woman artist. Despite the social limitations placed on female artists at the time, she made a noteworthy contribution to Canadian art and, in 1899, was the first woman to win the &quot;Prix Julian&quot; from the Académie Julian for portraiture. Pemberton also was the first artist from British Columbia to receive international acclaim when her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London (1897).

Pemberton married twice with subsequent changes in surname, complicating her visibility as an artist. She lived half her life in England, exhibiting frequently there but infrequently in Canada.She returned to her hometown Victoria on occasion to reconnect with family and friends.

She also played a role in Emily Carr&#x27;s &#x27;discovery&#x27;. The two artists grew up together in the same small city. While in BC in 1921, Pemberton talked with Harold Mortimer-Lamb about Emily Carr. He told Eric Brown, director at the National Gallery of Canada about Carr, leading to an invitation by the National Gallery of Canada for her work to be part of an exhibition on &quot;West Coast Art&quot; in 1927.

==Early years==
Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Sophie, as she was known throughout her life, was the
daughter of Theresa Jane Grautoff and Joseph Despard Pemberton (1821–1893), an engineer and surveyor, employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company on Vancouver Island. He was later a politician and successful businessman.

Pemberton first studied art at Mrs. Cridge&#x27;s Reformed Episcopal School and at age 13 had two watercolour landscapes included in a presentation album for the visiting Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. She often sketched en plein air, and recorded landscapes of the Cowichan Bay and Shawnigan Lake areas north of Victoria as well as the Fraser Valley. She attended finishing school in Brighton, UK where she received preliminary training in oil painting. Working from her studio in the family home, Pemberton aimed at becoming a professional artist.

==Training abroad==
In 1890, she travelled to London and studied with Arthur S. Cope following the curriculum of the South Kensington School of Art, where she excelled in her studies. She returned to Victoria afterward but came back to England, to the Clapham School of Art (1892-1893), taking the South Kensington School exams, receiving first-class grades in drawing from life, the antique, and still life, and had begun to attend the Westminster School of Art when in 1893 her father died and she experienced an emotional and physical breakdown, returning to Victoria the following year to recuperate. Her life would be punctuated, at inconvenient and unexpected moments with episodes of (possibly
psychosomatic) ill health with severe physical weakness.

In London again in 1895, she established herself in a studio in Chelsea, and met a network of artists, among them Anna Nordgren and Canadian artists Sydney Strickland Tully (with whom she shared a painting model) and Florence Carlyle. She went on a sketching trip to Brittany with Nordgren in 1896. Between 1896 and 1898 Pemberton exhibited steadily, receiving positive reviews. She was a member of the women&#x27;s 91 Art Club and was active in the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage. A major breakthrough for Pemberton came when the Royal Academy of Arts accepted &quot;Daffodils&quot;, 1897, a large academic realist oil painting, for its annual London summer exhibition.

In 1898, she enrolled at the Académie Julian in Paris, studying with Jean Paul Laurens and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant. It was a time-period when women artists generally received segregated art training and their accomplishments often were considered secondary to that of men. In 1899, she had the honour of being the first woman to receive the Prix Julian, a gold medal and cash award presented annually for the best student portrait at the academie, in a contest open to both men and women.

The following year she received the Julian-Smith Prix of 300 francs, another important achievement, reflecting the high quality of her portraiture. In 1900, Pemberton returned to live in Victoria following five highly successful years working in Europe. Pemberton&#x27;s goal was a serious one, to become a professional portrait artist, and she did so in a culture and at a time when formal portraiture in her chosen media, oil painting had been largely the domain of men.

==Work==

She painted portraits and landscapes in oil. Also from her earliest days, she painted finely detailed botanical studies in watercolour.

English and European influences can be seen in her work, primarily from the academic tradition of British portraiture and the Barbizon school but there are indications that she was aware of the French Impressionists and the current trends in art as reflected in the public exhibitions and private galleries.

On her retreats home to Victoria, Pemberton also taught painting to local female artists, sharing the experiences of her formal art training. In 1909, she painted a large mural for the non-denominational Pemberton Memorial Chapel gifted by her family to Victoria&#x27;s Royal Jubilee Hospital. This may be her only instance of public art.

==Selected exhibitions==
Pemberton showed her work at many regional galleries in the UK (1895-1898), at the Art Association of Montreal (AAM) (1895 and in 1910), the Royal Canadian Academy (1904, 1907, 1909), the Royal Academy in London (1897, 1898, 1901, 1904, 1907, 1910, 1916), the Paris
Salon with honourable mention medal in 1899 for her painting &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria) (1899, 1900 and 1903), the Canadian section of the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900),in Victoria (1902, 1904), in Vancouver (1904), and in the Canadian exhibition at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair) (1904). She exhibited 30 of her works at the Provincial Agricultural Exhibition in Victoria, B.C. and a show of &quot;The Pemberton Pictures&quot; in Vancouver (both 1904). She had a solo show of 40 oil landscapes at the Doré Gallery in London in 1909. In Victoria, she also had work in the Island Arts and Crafts Society exhibitions in 1916, 1921, and 1922.

A selection of her work was shown in 1949 at the precursor to the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria (AGGV), and a retrospective at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1954. After her death, the AGGV, the main repository of her work, held a small second retrospective, in 1967 and a major one in 1978.

In 2023, the AGGV organized a full-scale retrospective titled &quot;Unexpected: The Life and Art of Sophie Pemberton, Canadian Artist&quot;, guest curated by Dr. Kathryn Bridge who extensively researched Pemberton and discovered that the artist&#x27;s career which had been thought to came to an abrupt end shortly after her first marriage, and move of residence to the UK in 1909, forcing her into relative obscurity, actually was longer. Fascinating examples of her later work were included in this large (70 works, photographs, letters, diaries), important show. Also in 2023 to accompany the show, Bridge wrote, &quot;Sophie Pemberton: Life &amp; Work&quot; for the Art Institute of Canada, available online, which supplied additional information on Pemberton, including her extensive sketching travels in Europe, friendship with Victoria Sackville-West (mother of Vita Sackville-West), her role in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement, and her baffling recurring illnesses.

==Selected public collections==
Pemberton&#x27;s work is in the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Vancouver Art Gallery, Royal British Columbia Museum/B.C. Archives, and the Art Gallery of Hamilton.

==Selected honours and awards==
*1899: first woman to receive the Prix Julian, the Gold Medal awarded annually for the best work done in the Academie Julian in Paris;
*1899: honourable mention medal at the Paris Salon for her painting &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria);
*1900: Julian Smith Foundation Prize of Chicago.

==Memberships==
She was elected an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1906 and was a member of the B.C. Society of Fine Arts.

==Personal life==
In 1905, she married widower Arthur Beanlands, a Canon in the Anglican church,
and lived with him in England from 1909 until his death in 1917. From 1912-1922 she resided in Sevenoaks, Kent. She married again in 1920 to another widower, Horace Deane-Drummond and traveled with him to Ceylon and India. They settled in Gloucestershire. He died in 1930, after which she moved to London, living not far from her early studio and refused to move despite the Blitz bombings of London during the Second World War. 

From 1949 until her death, Pemberton lived in her hometown of Victoria, BC.
She died on October 31, 1959, in Victoria and was interred there in Ross Bay Cemetery.

<text>Michael Colle ( &quot;Cole&quot;; born February 1, 1945) is a Canadian politician who has served as deputy mayor of Toronto since 2023, representing North York. He was elected to represent Ward 8 Eglinton—Lawrence on Toronto City Council in the 2018 election. Colle served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2018 and was a Cabinet minister during Premier Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s tenure. He was formerly a York city councillor and Metro Toronto councillor, where he sat as the chair of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) from 1991 to 1994.

==Background==
Colle moved to Canada at a young age, and was educated at Carleton University. He worked as a teacher of history and economics for eighteen years, including several years at Michael Power High School and St. Michael&#x27;s College School in Toronto, Ontario.

His son Josh was a member of Toronto City Council between 2010 and 2018.

His cousin is former politician Lorenzo Berardinetti. Colle and Berardinetti&#x27;s families lived in the same home in downtown Toronto when they were children and the two cousins served together as Liberal MPPs in Queen&#x27;s Park.

==Politics==

===Early political career===
Colle served on the City of York council for Ward 2 from 1982 to 1985, and on the Metro Toronto Council representing York Eglinton from 1988 to 1994. He was also chair of the Toronto Transit Commission from 1991 to 1994.

===Provincial politics===

Colle was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent Tony Rizzo in the riding of Oakwood. In 1996, Colle supported Dwight Duncan&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become Ontario Liberal Party leader. In the 1999 provincial election, Colle defeated incumbent John Parker in the redistributed riding of Eglinton—Lawrence. The Ontario Progressive Conservative (PC) Party won both elections, and Colle sat in opposition during this period.

====Backbench====
Colle championed environmental causes during his time in the legislature including the protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine. He was a co-chair of Mel Lastman&#x27;s 1997 bid to become Mayor of Toronto.

====2003 election====
The Liberals won the 2003 election. Colle was re-elected in Eglinton—Lawrence.

==== Cabinet ====
Colle was named to cabinet on June 29, 2005 as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. From October 2007 to February 2010 he was Chief Government Whip.

He was criticized for his role in giving out $32 million in government grants to immigrant and cultural groups without official applications or formal statements of purpose. In one case that the auditor general highlighted, the Ontario Cricket Association received $1 million when it asked for $150,000. Premier McGuinty agreed to commission a special report on the matter, to be released in July 2007. Colle was to appear before the Standing Committee on Estimates before the Legislature was prorogued by the premier. Some believe this was arranged to prevent his testimony from going public. On July 26, 2007, Colle resigned as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Gerry Phillips was sworn in as the new Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, in addition to his responsibilities as Minister of Government Services.

==== 2007 election ====
In the 2007 provincial election, Colle was re-elected to serve his fourth term to represent Eglinton—Lawrence.

On February 24, 2009, Colle introduced the &quot;Zero Tolerance to Violence on Public Transit Act, 2009&quot; in an attempt to address the growing incidence of gun violence on Toronto public transit.

On March 25, 2009 Colle appeared to buck his own party by introducing Bill 160: &quot;The Caregiver and Foreign Worker Recruitment Act, 2009.&quot; This was in response to a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; report on the abuse of foreign nannies. After some initial reluctance by the government, Colle was able to convince the labour minister and the government to intervene. The government committed to introducing legislation to license &quot;nanny brokers&quot;, ban placement fees, and post licensed placement agencies on an online registry.

The McGuinty government introduced Bill 210, Employment Protection for Foreign Nationals Act (Live-in Caregivers and Others), 2009 (EPFNA) on October 21, 2009 and passed the &quot;Nanny Protection Act&quot; on December 15, 2009.

In 2010, Colle took on the issue of bedbugs eventually convincing Health Minister Deb Matthews to provide $5 million to fight the scourge with a bedbug strategy.

Colle also spent most of his fourth term advocating to get the Eglinton Crosstown LRT built. The provincial government has committed $8 billion for the new Eglinton line that runs along the southern border of his riding. Colle had advocated for the construction of the LRT following the Mike Harris government cancellation of the construction of the Eglinton West Line in 1996.

====2011 election====
In October 2011 he was re-elected to serve his fifth term to represent Eglinton—Lawrence. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Transportation and the Minister of Infrastructure. During this term Colle organized a petition requesting the addition of Oakwood station on the Eglinton Crosstown LRT line.

====2014 election and 2018 defeat====
In June 2014 he was re-elected to serve his sixth term to represent Eglinton—Lawrence. He served as parliamentary assistant to the minister of transportation. He was also appointed as deputy government whip.

In March 2016 Colle tabled the Tomato Act, proclaiming the tomato as the official vegetable of Ontario and designating July 15 as Tomato Day. The bill died on the order paper.

He was defeated in the 2018 provincial election.

===Return to municipal politics===

==== 2018 election ====
Weeks after the provincial election, Colle registered as a candidate for Toronto City Council&#x27;s Ward 13 (which was essentially Ward 15 from the 2014 election, with some boundary adjustments) in the 2018 Toronto municipal election, after his son Josh Colle, the incumbent Ward 15 city councillor, announced his retirement from politics.

In the last-minute redistricting imposed by the provincial government, Wards 13 and 14 (essentially corresponding to 2014 Wards 15 and 16) became the new Ward 8, so that Colle was now running against Christin Carmichael Greb, incumbent councillor from the former Ward 16. Colle won with 14,094 votes (41% of votes in the ward) to 7,395 for Carmichael Greb.

==== Work on council ====
In April 2019, Colle announced that he is going to introduce a motion that would ask the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) to suspend the liquor licence of bars where gun violence happens frequently.

In September 2020, Colle has requested that protected bike lanes be installed along Yonge Street from south of St. Clair Avenue to north of Lawrence Avenue in conjunction with on-street patios and other traffic-calming measures. The motion was approved by the city council on October 29 in a 19 to 3 vote, Councillor Stephen Holyday, one of the councillors voting against the motion, argued that approving this will create a bottleneck on an already congested thoroughfare that also serves as a vital backup artery for TTC subway replacement. Colle defended the plan claiming that the city’s goal is to move beyond people using cars to travel around the city’s core.

On October 7, 2020, Colle tabled a motion to rename Locksley Avenue, from Eglinton Avenue West to Hopewell Avenue, to Jimmy Wisdom Way. Jimmy Wisdom was a local community icon and renowned musical performer as a young man in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

Mayor Olivia Chow appointed Colle as one of four deputy mayors in 2023.

==== Housing ====
Colle advocates for the reintroduction of a speculation tax as part of a solution to address the rising price of housing in Toronto. Colle asked the province in December 2021 to introduce a tax on the sale of homes that are not principal residences in an effort to discourage speculators and &quot;home flippers.&quot; Ontario previously had such a tax under the government of Bill Davis in the 1970s.

Colle has been described as one of &quot;three Toronto councillors hopelessly exacerbating the housing crisis&quot; by More Neighbours Toronto.

<doc id="1145070" wikidata="Q5296319" url="?curid=1145070" title="Donna Cansfield">
<text>Donna H. Cansfield, (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2014 representing the riding of Etobicoke Centre. She served as a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Cansfield was born in Alberta in 1945. Prior to entering politics she was a homemaker, raising two children with her husband Bill. They live in central Etobicoke.

==Politics==

===School trustee===
In 1988, Cansfield was elected to the Etobicoke Board of Education. During her tenure she served as president of the Ontario Public School Boards&#x27; Association and later as president of the Canadian School Boards Association. She lost this position in 1997 when Ontario withdrew from the national association.

In November 1997 she was elected trustee as a member of the newly amalgamated Toronto District School Board. In December 2001 she was elected by a vote of 12–10 as president of the school board beating her rival Kathleen Wynne. In January 2003 Cansfield agreed to share the board chair position with Shelley Carroll. This came about because the board was deeply split by the province&#x27;s takeover of the school board in 2002 by superintendent Paul Christie. The province took this action because the board could not balance its budget. The dual chair position was to remain in place until the following election in November 2003. However, Cansfield resigned her position as co-chair four months later in order to focus on her run as a candidate in the 2003 provincial election. She retained her position as trustee.

===Provincial politics===
While there was some perception that Cansfield had centre-right or conservative views, she opted to run as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Etobicoke Centre in the 2003 election. Her decision to run for the Liberals rather than the Conservatives may have been driven by her distaste for the way that the Ernie Eves government had dealt with the budget crisis of the Toronto District School Board. She said, &quot;I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel with this government. I&#x27;m tired of people not standing up and saying, &#x27;I believe in public education.&#x27;&quot; She based her campaign on improvements to the education system and handily beat Conservative rival Rose Andrachuk by 4,460 votes.

Cansfield was appointed Parliamentary Assistant (PA) to Energy Minister Dwight Duncan on 23 October 2003. She was appointed as Minister of Energy on 11 October 2005 when Duncan was named as Minister of Finance. She was reassigned as Minister of Transportation on 23 May 2006, when Duncan returned to Energy.

After the 2007 election, Cansfield became Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Natural Resources, where she served until 18 January 2010. Premier McGuinty appointed Cansfield as PA to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing after the January 2010 cabinet shuffle.

In 2011, she was appointed as PA to the Minister of Economic Development and Innovation and in 2012 as PA to the Minister of Finance. In February 2013 as part of the Wynne government, she was appointed as chief government whip.

Cansfield left provincial politics after she declined to seek another term in the 2014 Ontario election.

<text>The KPXM Tower (formerly KXLI Tower) is the tallest structure in Minnesota, a guyed aerial mast rising . It formerly transmitted the signal for KPXM-TV (virtual channel 41 (16 digital), which is an Ion Television network affiliate licensed to serve St. Cloud, Minnesota. The tower is located about halfway between St. Cloud and the core of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, near the city of Big Lake.

The tower was completed in 1982 and is the property of American Tower. KXLI was the call sign of channel 41, which signed on the air the day before Thanksgiving 1982, when the tower was built. It surpassed the height of the KMSP Tower, completed in 1971.

The tallest non-guyed structures in the state are the IDS Center ( or with rooftop antennas) and the Capella Tower () in Minneapolis.

<doc id="1145078" wikidata="Q6933925" url="?curid=1145078" title="Muleskinner (band)">
<text>Muleskinner was an American bluegrass supergroup, active during the early 1970s.

==Early history==
In the late 1960s, Peter Rowan and David Grisman played together in a psychedelic band Earth Opera. The band didn&#x27;t last longer than couple of years and Rowan went on to join Seatrain, where he reconnected with Richard Greene. Rowan and Greene had been members of Bill Monroe&#x27;s Bluegrass Boys in 1964-1966. After two albums with Seatrain, Greene and Rowan went on to form Muleskinner with banjoist Bill Keith, whom Greene had played with in Jim Kweskin and the Jug Band in the early 1960s, and Clarence White, former guitarist of Kentucky Colonels and The Byrds, along with bassist John Kahn and drummer John Guerin, who also worked for The Byrds.

==Planned show with Bill Monroe==
This lineup can be considered as a bluegrass supergroup, a term not often used with bluegrass. The original start of the group was connected with Bill Monroe, as Richard Greene (who played for his Bluegrass Boys before), was asked to put a band together to join him in a television program. However, Monroe&#x27;s bus had some technical problems and Muleskinner had to play the whole evening on their own and it was a success.

==Recording contract==
All this resulted in a recording contract with Warner Bros. and the band recorded its first studio album, &quot;Muleskinner&quot;, which included elements from jazz, country and progressive bluegrass.

==Clarence White death==
The album was successful, but the band ended under tragic circumstances: guitarist Clarence White was killed by a drunken driver just couple of months after the record was released.
The band also recorded a live album in 1973, which was released 25 years later.

<doc id="1145079" wikidata="Q4141602" url="?curid=1145079" title="Laurel Broten">
<text>Laurel C. Broten (born 1967) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2013, who represented the Toronto riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. She served in the cabinets of Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Prior to entering politics, she was a lawyer, community activist, and volunteer. Broten attended McMaster University from 1986 to 1990, and has both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree from the institution. She also received an LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario in 1993. She was a law clerk to Madam Justice Claire L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé at the Supreme Court of Canada from 1993 to 1994, and later had a practice in civil and commercial litigation. She has also served as chair of the board of directors for the Gatehouse, a community centre for survivors of child abuse.

Broten, her husband, and their two children moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2013.

==Provincial politics==
Broten ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999 but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Morley Kells in Etobicoke-Lakeshore by 5,156 votes. She ran again in the 2003 election and defeated Kells by 6,722 votes amid a provincial shift to the Liberals.

===38th Legislative Assembly===
On October 23, 2003, she was named as the Parliamentary Assistant to Premier Dalton McGuinty. In this role, she conducted province-wide consultations to develop reforms to address domestic violence in Ontario. This led to the government&#x27;s Domestic Violence Action Plan which included a public education campaign. She also chaired the Premier&#x27;s Shared Air Summit, which drew scientists and policymakers from across North America to tackle the linked issues of smog and transboundary air pollution.

She introduced two private member&#x27;s bills in 2004. The first, entitled &quot;Kids First Licences Act&quot;, proposed to allow drivers to make charitable donations to children&#x27;s charities whenever they renewed their vehicle licence. The second, called &quot;Workplace Violence and Workplace Harassment&quot; (an amendment to the &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Act&quot;), proposed to impose additional duties and responsibilities in workplaces.

On June 29, 2005, Broten was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. As minister, she developed policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She also introduced the &quot;Clean Water Act&quot; designed to better safeguard Ontario&#x27;s drinking water.

===39th Legislative Assembly===
Broten was re-elected in 2007 and was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. While there, she authored a report detailing a Five Point Action Plan to create more opportunities and reduce barriers for internationally trained doctors in Ontario. Her report formed the basis for new legislation in 2008.

In 2008, she introduced legislation that imposes a duty to report images of child abuse. The following year, she unanimously passed a resolution calling for a review of reporting standards for listed companies.

In 2009, Broten was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. On October 7 that year, she was appointed Minister of Children and Youth Services and Minister Responsible for Women&#x27;s Issues.

===40th Legislative Assembly===
In 2011, Broten was re-elected again. Premier Dalton McGuinty reorganized his cabinet and appointed her as Minister of Education and minister responsible for women&#x27;s issues.

On February 11, 2013, following a long battle with teachers&#x27; unions, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed her as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Laurel resigned from the cabinet and the legislature on July 2, 2013.

On June 23, 2013, Broten announced that she would be &quot;leaving politics effective July 2nd&quot; and moving to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

===Cabinet positions===


===Electoral record===















==Post-political career==
After she resigned from the Ontario Cabinet and legislature, Broten and her family eventually settled in Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia. She had initially stated that she was moving to Halifax, for her husband Paul obtained a job at Emera as special counsel for senior projects.

Not long after Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil&#x27;s Liberal Party swept to electoral victory, she was hired as a government consultant to lead a comprehensive review of the taxation in the province. Her final report, released on November 19, 2014, made 22 recommendations on taxation; these included eliminating the tax bracket for high-income ($150,000 and over) earners, eliminating refundable tax credits, eliminating a tax rebate for seniors, reducing corporate taxes for large businesses, introducing a carbon tax and expanding the HST to include numerous exempt products including books, children&#x27;s clothes, diapers, and feminine hygiene products. Broten&#x27;s report was generally panned, and Nova Scotia Finance Minister Diana Whalen subsequently scheduled several public consultations across the province in the winter of 2015. On March 25, 2015, Whalen said &quot;every recommendation in the Broten review is [being] looked at&quot;, including a carbon tax, but only explicitly ruled out increasing the HST on books and eliminating a volunteer firefighter tax credit.

On January 14, 2015, Broten was selected by the Nova Scotia Business Incorporated (NSBI) board for the position of president and CEO of NSBI. Her initial salary was comparable to that of her predecessor, Stephen Lund.

<doc id="1145084" wikidata="Q787383" url="?curid=1145084" title="North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)">
<text>The North Eastern Railway (NER) was an English railway company. It was incorporated in 1854 by the combination of several existing railway companies. Later, it was amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping in 1923. Its main line survives to the present day as part of the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh.

Unlike many other pre-Grouping companies the NER had a relatively compact territory, in which it had a near monopoly. That district extended through Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumberland, with outposts in Westmorland and Cumberland. The only company penetrating its territory was the Hull &amp; Barnsley, which it absorbed shortly before the main grouping. The NER&#x27;s main line formed the middle link on the Anglo-Scottish &quot;East Coast Main Line&quot; between London and Edinburgh, joining the Great Northern Railway near Doncaster and the North British Railway at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Although primarily a Northern English railway, the NER had a short length of line in Scotland, in Roxburghshire, with stations at Carham and Sprouston on the Tweedmouth-Kelso route (making it the only English railway with sole ownership of any line in Scotland), and was a joint owner of the Forth railway bridge and its approach lines. The NER was the only English railway to run trains regularly into Scotland, over the Berwick-Edinburgh main line as well as on the Tweedmouth-Kelso branch.

The total length of line owned was and the company&#x27;s share capital was £82 million. The headquarters were at York and the works at Darlington, Gateshead, York and elsewhere.

Befitting the successor to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the NER had a reputation for innovation. It was a pioneer in architectural and design matters and in electrification. By 1906 the NER was further ahead than any other British railway in having a set of rules agreed with the trades unions, including arbitration, for resolving disputes. In its final days it also began the collection that became the Railway Museum at York, now the National Railway Museum.

In 1913, the company achieved a total revenue of £11,315,130 () with working expenses of £7,220,784 ().

During the First World War, the NER lost a total of 2,236 men who are commemorated on the North Eastern Railway War Memorial in York. An earlier printed Roll of Honour lists 1,908 men. They also raised two &#x27;Pals Battalions&#x27;, the 17th (N.E.R. Pioneer) Battalion and 32nd (N.E.R. Reserve) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers. This was the first time that a battalion had been raised from one Company. The company also sent two tug boats, &quot;NER No.3&quot;. and &quot;Stranton&quot; The latter became HM Tug Char and was lost at sea on 16 January 1915 with the loss of all hands.

The NER Heraldic Device (seen above the tile map photo) was a combination of the devices of its three major constituents at formation in 1854: the York and North Midland Railway (top; arms of the City of York); the Leeds Northern Railway (lower left; arms of the City of Leeds along with representations of the expected traffic, wool and corn, and connection to the sea via the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway); and the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway (lower right; parts of the arms of the three places in its title)

== Principal stations ==

Having inherited the country&#x27;s first ever great barrel-vault roofed station, Newcastle Central, from its constituent the York Newcastle &amp; Berwick railway, the NER during the next half century with examples at Alnwick, Tynemouth, Gateshead East, Sunderland, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Darlington Bank Top, York and Hull Paragon; the rebuilding and enlargement of the last-named resulting in the last of the type in the country. The four largest, at Newcastle, Darlington, York and Hull survive in transport use, as does Tynemouth. Alnwick is still extant but in non-transport use since 1991 as a second-hand book warehouse, the others having been demolished during the 1950s/60s state-owned railway era, two (Sunderland and Middlesbrough) following Second World War bomb damage.

*York station (York) was the hub of the system, and the headquarters of the line was located here. The basis for the present station was opened on 25 June 1877. From June 1909 to May 1951, when it was replaced by an electric system, the 295-lever Locomotive Yard signal cabin contained the largest mechanical lever frame in Britain.
*Newcastle station (Newcastle), opened on 29 August 1850, became the largest on the NER.
*Leeds New Station (later Leeds City, now Leeds) was a joint undertaking with the London and North Western Railway. It opened in 1869.

==Architects==
The NER was the first railway company in the world to appoint a full-time salaried architect to work with its chief engineer in constructing railway facilities. Some of the men appointed were based in, or active in, Darlington.

* George Townsend Andrews was the first architect associated with the North Eastern Railway. He designed the first permanent station at York, along with others on the NER route. He also designed the Assembly Rooms in York.
* Thomas Prosser held the position from 1854 to 1874. He worked in Newcastle.
* Benjamin Burleigh, served for two years, dying in office. 
* William Peachey, was based in Darlington, and served for two years. Peachey had been architect to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and when this merged into the NER in 1863, he was made Darlington section architect. Most of his work was to extend and improve railway buildings. Elsewhere he built the Zetland Hotel at Saltburn (1861–63), and the Royal Station Hotel at York (1877–82). He also practised privately, designing a few nonconformist chapels, including Grange Road Baptist Chapel in Darlington, 1870–1.

* William Bell worked for the NER for 50 years; he was chief architect for 37 years, between 1877 and 1914. His major contributions were as NER architect. Bank Top (1884–87) is one of the best examples of his station designs, for which he developed a standard system of roof building. He added various elements to the North Road Engineering works between 1884 and 1910. He also designed the offices of the Mechanical Engineer&#x27;s Department in Brinkburn Road in 1912, showing that he could adapt his style to the new influences of the Queen Anne revival.
* Horace Field, with William Bell, designed the Headquarters Offices in York completed in 1906, now The Grand Hotel and Spa. Field also designed the company&#x27;s London office at 4 Cowley Street, Westminster, completed the same year as the York offices, which was later used by the Liberal Democratic Party as its headquarters and is now a private house.
*Arthur Pollard and Stephen Wilkinson each briefly filled the position of chief architect. The department remained in York after the merger of the company into the LNER.

Professional design was carried through to small fixtures and fittings, such as platform seating, for which the NER adopted distinctive &#x27;coiled snake&#x27; bench-ends. Cast-iron footbridges were also produced to a distinctive design. The NER&#x27;s legacy continued to influence the systematic approach to design adopted by the grouped LNER.

==Chairmen and directors==
===Chairmen ===

*James Pulleine (1854–55)
*Harry Stephen Thompson (1855–74)
*George Leeman (1874–80)
*John Dent Dent (1880–94)
*Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, Bart (1895–1902) 
*Viscount Ridley (1902–04)
*Sir Edward Grey, Bart (1904–05)
*John Lloyd Wharton (1906–12)
*Baron Knaresborough (1912–22)

===Directors ===
The initial NER board of directors was drawn from the directors of its four constituent companies. A director of the NER from 1864, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death in 1904, was ironmaster and industrial chemist Sir Lowthian Bell. His son Sir Hugh Bell was also a director; he had a private platform on the line between Middlesbrough and Redcar at the bottom of the garden of his house Red Barns. Gertrude Bell&#x27;s biographer, Georgina Howell, recounts a story about the Bells and the NER:

Among the other famous directors of the NER were George Leeman (director 1854–82, Chairman 1874–80); Henry Pease (director 1861–1881); Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, Bart. (director 1863–1902, Chairman 1895–1902); John Dent Dent (director 1879–94, Chairman 1880–94); Matthew White Ridley, 1st Viscount Ridley (director 1881–1904, Chairman 1902–04); Sir Edward Grey, Bart (see below); George Gibb (solicitor 1882–1891, general manager 1891–1906, director 1906–1910); and Henry Tennant (director 1891–1910).

In 1898 Sir Edward Grey became a director, later becoming Chairman (1904-5; curtailed by his appointment as Foreign Secretary). In his autobiographical work &quot;Twenty-Five Years&quot; Grey later wrote that ‘…the year 1905 was one of the happiest of my life; the work of Chairman of the Railway was agreeable and interesting…’. After leaving the Foreign Office Grey resumed his directorship of the NER in 1917, and when the North Eastern Railway became part of the London and North Eastern Railway he became a director of that company, remaining in this position until 1933. At the Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925, Grey accompanied the Duke and Duchess of York and presented them with silver models of the Stockton and Darlington Railway engine &quot;Locomotion&quot; and the passenger carriage &quot;Experiment&quot;.

The above list only covers the most senior officers of the company and its passenger department. Further lists covering the officers in the Engineering, Locomotive and Docks departments will be summarised here as they appear.

== Operating divisions ==
The Northern and Southern Divisions were established for operating and engineering purposes on the creation of the NER in 1854. When the merger with the Stockton and Darlington Railway took place in 1863 their lines became the ‘Darlington Section’ until 1873, and then the Central Division. In 1888 the boundaries were altered to remove anomalies; for example, the former Clarence Railway routes became part of the Central Division. The engineering and purchasing autonomy of the three divisions brought about diverging styles of infrastructure. In 1899 it was decided to abolish the Central Division and its area was divided between the Northern and Southern Divisions.

==Electrified lines==
The NER was one of the first main line rail companies in Britain to adopt electric traction, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway having opened its first electrified line between Liverpool and Southport one week earlier.

===Tyneside===

The Tyneside scheme commenced public operation on 29 March 1904. The scheme was known as Tyneside Electrics and totalled about 30 miles:
*Newcastle Central via Wallsend, Whitley Bay, Gosforth and New Bridge Street (the Newcastle terminus of the former Blyth &amp; Tyne Railway)
*Heaton to Benton or Backworth via the East Coast Main Line
*Riverside Branch from Byker to Percy Main
*Newcastle Quayside Branch
The last-named was electrically operated from June 1905 and was a 3/4 mile freight-only line from Trafalgar Yard, Manors to Newcastle Quayside Yard.

Further extensions taking the electrification to South Shields were carried out in March 1938 by the London and North Eastern Railway

The lines were originally electrified at 600 V DC using the 3rd rail system, although after 1934 the operating voltage was raised to 630 V DC. On the Newcastle Quayside Branch overhead line of tramway type was used for upper and lower yards (to avoid the danger of shunters and other staff coming into contact with live rails) with 3rd rail in the interconnecting tunnels between the yards.

===Newport-Shildon===

The Newport-Shildon line was electrified on the 1,500 V DC overhead system between 1914 and 1916 and the locomotives which later became British Rail Class EF1 were used on this section.
===Proposed main line electrification===
After the success of the earlier schemes, in 1919 the North Eastern Railway made plans to electrify of the East Coast Main Line between York and Newcastle with a mixture of third rails and overhead lines at 1,500 DC. The scheme advanced as far as a prototype passenger locomotive, however the scheme was dropped on financial grounds by the time of the 1923 grouping, due in large part to the difficult economic climate of the time.

==Traffic==
The NER carried a larger tonnage of mineral and coal traffic than any other principal railway.

The NER was a partner (with the North British and the Great Northern Railway) in the East Coast Joint Stock operation from 1860.

== Signalling ==
The signalling of the NER and its constituent companies in the 1850s and 1860s was, at best, average for the period (with the notable exception of the Stockton and Darlington Railway). Passenger traffic density and train speeds were generally low and, despite the absence of continuous brakes, train crews were usually able to pull up short of an obstruction. The time interval system was in widespread use, and the interlocking of points and signals was very rare. It was only after a spate of accidents (notably at Brockley Whins in 1870, see below), and mounting public pressure, that the NER began to adopt the block system and interlocking. Once this decision had been taken, the company made reasonably speedy progress, aided by the scrutiny of the Railway Inspectorate (Board of Trade) whose officers were supported by increasingly comprehensive legislation. The inception of block signalling in particular brought with it a large increase in manpower to operate and maintain the new equipment, along with the need for staff literacy. This was essential to enable compliance with a large number of new rules and regulations covering block working and the operation of the electric telegraph. In the last years of the Nineteenth Century a combination of changes began to drive modernisation of the signalling systems in the north-east of England. The track layouts installed in the 1870s were no longer adequate to handle the increased traffic and the signalling equipment was worn out or becoming obsolete. Longer and heavier trains were running, often at higher speeds; electricity was playing an increasing role, and finally the managers of Britain’s railways were becoming aware of the radical changes by which the railways in the United States were improving revenues, productivity and safety. The NER made several bold moves towards automatic and power signalling, but these did not always bring the benefits hoped for.

By the end of its independent existence the North Eastern Railway had one of the most advanced signal systems of the LNER constituent companies – the Great Central was also well-equipped – and the progressive attitude of the signal engineers continued to make itself felt in the North Eastern Area of the new company. Despite this, features dating back to the mid- Nineteenth Century remained in use, such as slotted-post semaphore signals and rotating board signals. By 1910 about 1,150 block signal cabins controlled the NER network, along with numerous other signalling installations at level crossings and isolated sidings.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 6 December 1870, a collision between two trains at Brockley Whins, County Durham killed five people. The accident was caused by a lack of interlocking between points and signals, and is generally viewed as having persuaded the NER board to adopt the block system and interlocking.
*In 1870, a freight train overran signals and collided with a London and North Western Railway passenger train at St. Nicholas Crossing, Carlisle, Cumberland. Five people were killed. The driver of the freight was intoxicated.
*On 27 July 1875, the boiler of a locomotive exploded at station, Leeds, Yorkshire.
*On 25 March 1877, an express passenger train was derailed at , Northumberland due to excessive speed on a curve. Five people were killed and seventeen were injured.
*In 1877,the boiler of a locomotive exploded at , Yorkshire.
*On 10 August 1880, an express passenger train hauled by a NER locomotive was derailed on the North British Railway near Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland due to defective track. Three people were killed.
*On 25 October 1887, a freight train overran signals at , Northumberland and was in a head-on collision with a locomotive that was shunting. That locomotive and its wagons were pushed into a stationary passenger train.
*In 1890, a freight train was derailed on the Redheugh Incline, Gateshead, County Durham.
*On 2 November 1892, an express passenger train was in a rear-end collision with a freight train at , Yorkshire due to errors by the driver of the freight train and a signalman. The latter had fallen asleep on the night shift after spending his rest day searching for medical help for his infant daughter. Ten people were killed and 43 were injured.
*On 4 November 1894, a sleeping car train overran signals and collided with a freight train that was being shunted at Castle Hills, Yorkshire. One person was killed.
*On 5 November 1900, a freight train ran away and was derailed by trap points at Lingdale Junction, Yorkshire.
*On 4 July 1901, a freight train was unable to stop and ran off the end of a siding at , County Durham.
*On 27 June 1905, a freight train was derailed at Wallsend, Northumberland.
*On 24 November 1906, a passenger train overran signals and ran into the rear of a freight train at , Yorkshire.

*On 26 March 1907, a passenger train was derailed by heat buckled track at Felling, County Durham (now Tyne and Wear). Two people were killed and six were seriously injured. The accident could have been prevented as the signalman had been warned of the buckle by a member of the public but refused to heed the warning.
*On 28 August 1907, a freight train overran signals and was derailed at , Northumberland. Two people were killed and one was seriously injured.
*On 8 October 1908, an overloaded freight train ran away and crashed into goods wagons at , Yorkshire.
*On 29 May 1909, a freight train was derailed at Skinningrove, Yorkshire due to subsidence of the trackbed.
*On 8 August 1909, a freight train was derailed at Hartley, Cumberland due to the track buckling in the heat of the sun.
*On 15 November 1910, an express freight train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with a freight train at , County Durham.
*On 15 December 1911, a freight train was derailed at Lartington, Yorkshire due to the driver braking too sharply. During recovery operations, a rail-mounted crane overturned.
*On 17 December 1915, a passenger train collided with a light engine at St Bede&#x27;s Junction, Tyne Dock. The light engine had been overlooked by the signalman. An empty carriage train travelling in the opposite direction then ran into the wreckage. The wooden carriages were gas-lit and caught fire; 17 people died and 81 were injured.
*On 3 March 1916, an empty stock train was in a rear-end collision with an electric multiple unit at station, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. Forty-nine people were injured.
*On 15 September 1917, a set of carriages ran away from and was derailed. Three people were killed.
*On 11 August 1918, the carriage sheds at Heaton, Newcastle were destroyed by fire, as were 34 carriages forming a number of NER electric units.
*On 14 February 1920, two freight trains were involved in a head-on collision at Skelton, Yorkshire.
*On 31 March 1920, a passenger train was derailed at station.
*On 22 October 1921, Petrol Inspection Saloon No. 3768 was destroyed by fire at York station.

==Docks==
The company owned the following docks:
*The Hull Docks Company (Queens dock, Humber Dock, Railway Dock, Victoria dock, Albert dock, William Wright Dock, St Andrews dock): acquired 1893. Dealt with a large variety of cargoes, including coal exports, grain, seed, and imports of timber and fruit
**King George Dock (opened 1914) – jointly operated with the Hull and Barnsley Railway.The Dock was used by the 17th (NER Pioneer) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers as a base during its formation in 1915.
*Hartlepool Docks: acquired as part of the West Hartlepool Harbour &amp; Railway in 1865. Major imports of Scandinavian timber (including pit props for coal mines): coal exports from the south Durham coalfield
*Tyne Dock: opened by the NER in 1859. Major coal export terminal; also chemicals and grain exports. Imports including iron ore and esparto grass for paper manufacture.
*Middlesbrough Dock: Opened in 1842 by the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Iron and steel exports; and a worldwide trade in other goods.
The NER also owned coal-shipping staithes at Blyth and Dunston-on-Tyne. The numerous other coal export staiths on the Tyne, the Wear and at Seaham were owned by the colliery companies or the river improvement commissioners. Wilson&#x27;s &amp; North Eastern Railway Shipping Co. Ltd steamers ran between Hull and Antwerp, Ghent and Dunkirk.

One tug, Stranton, used at West Hartlepool Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty during the First World War but was lost at sea in January 1915.

==Coaching stock==

The NER originally operated with short four and six wheeled coaches with a fixed wheelbase. From these were developed the standard six-wheeled, low elliptical roofed coaches which were built in their thousands around the 1880s. One variety alone, the diagram 15, five compartment, full 3rd class, numbered around a thousand. The NER started building bogie stock for general service use in 1894, clerestories for general use with a variation built for use on the tightly curved line from Malton to Whitby. There were also a series of low ark roofed bogie coaches (with birdcage brakes) for use on the coast line north of Scarborough.
Coach manufacture moved to high arched roof vehicles but with substantially the same body design in the early 1900s.

The NER had limited need for vestibuled coaches but from 1900 built a series of vestibuled, corridor coaches with British Standard gangways, for their longer distance services. The company introduced clerestory corridor dining trains on services between London and Edinburgh. The initial trial was run between York and Newcastle in 1 hour 30 minutes on 30 July 1900. The new train consisted of eight coaches and was long (excluding the engine), and had seating for 50 first-class and 211 third-class passengers. At the same time they built (in conjunction with their partners) similar coaches for the East Coast Joint Stock (GNR/NER/NBR) and the Great Northern and North Eastern Joint Stock.

All NER coach building was concentrated at their York Carriage Works, which went on to be the main LNER carriage works after grouping.

With the introduction of the standard 6-wheeled coaches NER carriage livery was standardised as &#x27;deep crimson&#x27; (a deeper colour with more blue in it than that used by the Midland Railway), lined with cream edged on both sides with a thin vermillion line. For a time the cream was replaced with gold leaf. Lettering (&#x27;N.E.R.&#x27; or when there was sufficient space &#x27;North Eastern Railway&#x27; in full, together with &#x27;First&#x27;, &#x27;Third&#x27; and &#x27;Luggage Compt.&#x27; on the appropriate door) and numbering; was in strongly serifed characters, blocked and shaded to give a 3D effect.

The NER&#x27;s bogie coach building programme was such that, almost unique amongst pre-grouping railways, they had sufficient bogie coaches to cover normal service trains; six wheel coaches were reserved for strengthening and excursion trains.

<text>The Comédie-Française () or Théâtre-Français () is one of the few state theatres in France. Founded in 1680, it is the oldest active theatre company in the world. Established as a French state-controlled entity in 1995, it is the only state theatre in France to have its own permanent troupe of actors. The company&#x27;s primary venue is the Salle Richelieu, which is a part of the Palais-Royal complex and located at 2, Rue de Richelieu on Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

The theatre has also been known as the Théâtre de la République and popularly as &quot;La Maison de Molière&quot; (The House of Molière). It acquired the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before his troupe became known as the Comédie-Française, but the company continued to be known as &quot;La Maison de Molière&quot; even after the official change of name.

==History==
The Comédie-Française was founded on 8 August 1680 by a decree of Louis XIV merging the only two Parisian acting troupes of the time, the troupe of the Guénégaud Theatre and that of the Hôtel de Bourgogne. On the death of Molière in 1673, the troupe at the Guénégaud had been formed by a merger of the Théâtre du Marais and the Troupe de Molière. Two years later they received a royal grant of 12,000 livres per year; and seven years later they received their present designation. Thus the Comédie-Française may be said to have an unbroken tradition reaching back to the days of Molière.


The company gave its first performance on 25 August 1680 at the Guénégaud. Its leading actors included Molière&#x27;s widow, Armande Béjart, her husband, Guérin d&#x27;Estriché, La Grange, Mlle Champmeslé, Baron, Hauteroche, and Raymond Poisson. The repertoire consisted of the collection of theatrical works by Molière and Jean Racine, along with a few works by Pierre Corneille, Paul Scarron and Jean Rotrou.

In the 18th century, the Comédie-Française was often enjoyed by the French nobility, since the price to watch at the theater was expensive.

On the performance of Joseph Chénier&#x27;s anti-monarchical play &quot;Charles IX&quot; in 1789, violent political discussions arose among the performers, and ultimately they split into two sections: the Republican party, under the young tragedian Talma, establishing a new theatre under the name &quot;Théâtre de la République,&quot; on the site of the present building in the Rue de Richelieu; while the Royalist section took the title &quot;Théâtre de la Nation&quot;. 

On 16 April 1790 the theatre presented the world premiere of Pierre Laujon&#x27;s &quot;Le Couvent, ou les Fruits du caractère et de l&#x27;éducation&quot;; the first French play to feature a cast made up of only women. On 3 September 1793, during the French Revolution, the Théâtre de la Nation was closed by order of the Committee of Public Safety for putting on the allegedly seditious play &quot;Pamela&quot;, and the actors were imprisoned though gradually released later. On 31 May 1799, the new government made the Salle Richelieu available and allowed the actors to reconstitute the troupe.

The Comédie-Française today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatres in Paris (Salle Richelieu, next to the Palais Royal; théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Théâtre).

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Since October 2020, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Comédie-Française had to close as it is the case for all other theaters in France. The Comédie-Française having a permanent troupe of actors, it was decided to switch temporarily to an online program, including readings of the full text of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, and an online initiative called &quot;Théâtre à la table&quot; where actors of the troupe play works in the repertoire after a one week rehearsal.

Online attendance for this initiative was unexpectedly high, including people outside of Paris and in other countries.

In May 2021 Éric Ruf, the managing director of the Comédie-Française, declared that 30% of the public of the online program never went to the Comédie-Française, and that they would continue this program even after the reopening.

==Theatre buildings==
The Comédie-Française has had several homes since its inception in 1680 in the Salle Guénégaud. In 1689, it was established in a theatre across from the Café Procope. From 1770 to 1782, the Comédie performed in the theatre in the royal palace of the Tuileries. In 1782, the company moved into the Salle du Faubourg Saint-Germain, designed by architects Marie-Joseph Peyre and Charles De Wailly and located on the site of today&#x27;s Odéon. Since 1799, the Comédie-Française has been housed in the Salle Richelieu (architect Victor Louis) at 2, rue de Richelieu. This theatre was enlarged and modified in the 1800s, then rebuilt in 1900 after a severe fire. The actress Jane Henriot was the only casualty of the fire.

==Theatrical troupe==

The membership of the theatrical troupe is divided into and . The former are regular members of the organisation and as such receive a pension after 20 years of service, while the latter are paid actors who may, after a certain length of service, become . The names of nearly all the great actors and dramatists of France have, at some time in their career, been associated with that of the Comédie-Française.

===Homage to Molière===
Every year on 15 January, the company performs an “Homage to Molière” on the anniversary of his christening and possibly his birth. Following that evening’s performance, which nowadays is free, all members of the troupe, and since 2009 of its academy, assemble on the stage behind a bust of Molière, wearing costumes of their choice from the theatre’s repertoire. They first process in ranks to bow to the audience’s applause. Each member then says a line from Molière’s plays, also applauded. In conclusion, the dean introduces to the audience the new members of the academy, the new , and the new , and has the departing applauded.

The tradition was started in 1773 on the centenary of Molière’s death. In 1821, it was moved to his recently-discovered christening date, and the next year approached its present form as the final scene of a play specially written by Justin Gensoul, . In the 19th century, &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; was often performed on that date, as the final divertissement made it possible for the entire troupe to appear. Similar homages became popular at the Odéon, as well as in other theatres when these lost their privilege to perform Molière in 1864; however, the Comédie-Française is the only one that has maintained it.

The (procession) of the Paris Opera Ballet, created in the 20th century, bears similarities to the homage.

==Administrators of the Comédie-Française==
The chief administrator of the Comédie-Française has been given the title &quot;administrateur général&quot; since Simonis&#x27; term of 1850. Before that, a variety of titles were given.

<text>The Argentine Grand Prix (Spanish: &quot;Gran Premio de Argentina&quot;) was a round of the Formula One championship, held intermittently from to , at the Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez in the Argentine national capital of Buenos Aires.

==Origins and history==
The Buenos Aires Grand Prix was an event first started in 1930 as a sportscar event held at the Costanera circuit until 1940 and switched to the Retiro circuit for 1941. After a six-year break and by then Juan Peron in office, racing resumed in 1947 at Retiro with the start of the South American &quot;Temporada&quot; Grand Prix series, competing twice that year under the Formula Libre regulations. Italian Luigi Villoresi won all 1947 Temporada events. The race regularly attracted Brazilian and European drivers and also Argentine drivers competing in Europe, such as Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán González. For the 1948 Grand Prix season, the race was moved to Palermo until the end of 1950. In 1951, the Costanera Norte circuit would host its last three Grand Prix events before completion of the Autodromo 17 de Octubre (October 17), a purpose-built circuit where the championship Formula One Argentine Grand Prix was held on different variants of the facility from 1953 to 1960, 1972 to 1981 and 1995 to 1998.

===Buenos Aires===

Built in 1952 on swampland just outside Buenos Aires, the circuit featured a white archway dedicated to the memory of Admiral William Brown. The circuit opened in March 1952 with the fifth edition of the &quot;Perón Cup&quot;, which was won by Juan Manuel Fangio and in 1953, hosted the first Formula One race to be held in South America.

The track featured four different configurations for Grand Prix racing. From 1953 to 1960, the Argentine Grand Prix was held on the &quot;No. 2&quot; layout, clockwise for the all these years except 1954, when it was run counterclockwise. From 1971 to 1973 the race was held on the &quot;No. 9&quot; configuration, more or less the same as the &quot;No. 2&quot; configuration but for the section after Tobogan which was shortened and the Horquilla turn was made tighter and shorter. Then from 1974 to 1981, the race was run on the &quot;No. 15&quot; configuration, the longest and fastest layout that combined two very fast successive right and left hand corners with two long straights and a spectacular long and wide third corner (called the Curvon Salotto) into the infield section from the previous &quot;No. 9&quot; configuration. For the period from 1995 to 1998, the race was held on the twisty &quot;No. 6&quot; configuration using only the infield section with the S-shaped Los Mixos chicane.

====1953–1960====

The 1953 race saw Fangio retire his Maserati after 36 laps due to a transmission failure; Alberto Ascari&#x27;s victory for Ferrari was overshadowed by an accident which killed nine people and injured many others due to overcrowding along the track. The race was heavily advertised and it is believed that around 400,000 people turned up for the event. The facility was so packed that people were standing on the edges of corners, inches away from the cars apexing the corners.

The following year, the circuit was run in an anticlockwise direction, and Fangio did reach the top of the podium, winning his home Grand Prix on his second attempt; he would go on to win the next three Grands Prix in Argentina, one of which was the 1955 race. It was one of the hottest races on record, at 40C (104F) with track temperatures reaching 51C (122F). Fangio, now driving for Mercedes, was the only driver to complete the 96 laps after three hours without handing his car over to another driver. One of his legs was badly burned by a chassis tube heated by the exhaust, an injury that forced a three-month recovery. In , Stirling Moss took the win, in the penultimate race in Fangio&#x27;s career. It was also the first Formula One championship victory for a rear or mid-engined car and the first for a privateer. New Zealander Bruce McLaren won in 1960. With Fangio&#x27;s retirement and the subsequent retirement of fellow Argentine driver José Froilán González, combined with unstable governments after the exile of Peron (in 1955), the Argentine Grand Prix disappeared from the F1 calendar in 1961 for over a decade.

====1971–1981====

A non-championship Formula One race was held at Buenos Aires in 1971, won by Chris Amon over two heats. In the Argentine Grand Prix returned to the World Championship, with Carlos Reutemann emerging as the new home favorite. The variant used for these two years was similar to the one used before, except the straight leading into the hairpin after the Toboggan esses was shortened. Reutemann took pole position in his world championship debut, becoming only the second driver to achieve this feat. The race was won by world champion Jackie Stewart. 1973 saw Emerson Fittipaldi take victory at the last part of the race from Frenchman François Cevert.

For 1974, the circuit used the faster and longer No. 15 circuit, which included two very fast and slightly banked corners that led into a section that went around a lake, which included a long straight that led into a flat-out right handed 180 corner called the Curvon, and this led into a straight which returned to the twisty arena that had always been used before. The cars were flat-out for 45 whole seconds throughout this whole lake loop: overtaking was rife on this part of the circuit. During the 1974 race, homeland hero Reutemann so very nearly took victory, but the Brabham mechanics apparently did not put enough fuel in the Argentine&#x27;s car and he ran out, and victory went to veteran New Zealander Denny Hulme. 1977 saw South African Jody Scheckter take an amazing victory in the Walter Wolf team&#x27;s first ever Grand Prix in extremely hot weather, and 1978 saw Mario Andretti begin his domination of that season, driving for Lotus. 1979 was an exciting race, the race started with a huge accident at the first two very fast esses; Scheckter and John Watson in a McLaren collided and took out nine cars; six of whom were eliminated on the spot. The race was restarted, and the blue Ligiers of Frenchmen Jacques Laffite and Patrick Depailler lead much of the proceedings, but the wily Reutemann, now driving for Lotus, drove methodically through the field and pressed Laffite, but could not catch the flying Frenchman, and Reutemann finished 2nd.

In 1980, the drivers, led by Emerson Fittipaldi attempted to boycott the race due to the poor state of the track; the new surface was breaking up in many spots because of the hot weather and the extreme suction of the ground-effect cars of the time, and gravel was strewn all over the track from the cracks in the tarmac. The race went ahead anyway after some repairs (which proved not to be good enough, and the track broke up again) and Australian Alan Jones in a Williams, Brazilian Nelson Piquet in a Brabham, Canadian Gilles Villeneuve, Laffite and Reutemann all battled for top positions; Reutemann went out early with engine problems after he went off the circuit after attempting to pass Piquet and he got grass in his radiators. Because of the track breaking apart and being littered with gravel, Jones went off twice at the Ombu section and was passed by Laffite, Villeneuve and Piquet (who all went off at other parts of the track); and he went into the pits, got the grass out of his radiators and came out in 4th. He charged through the field and passed Villeneuve and Piquet; Laffite retired with engine problems; and the Australian took victory followed by Piquet and Keke Rosberg scoring his first podium finish; and Frenchman Alain Prost scored one point in his debut F1 race, driving for McLaren. The 1981 race, which was held in cooler April weather, was a Brabham procession; designer Gordon Murray found a way to circumvent the new regulations with a hydropneumatic suspension which lowered the cars closer to the ground; and therefore were faster around corners than everyone else. Piquet took victory, Reutemann finished 2nd and Prost took 3rd.

The 1982 round was supposed to be held in early March, but the political fallout during the drivers strike just before the South African Grand Prix caused the sponsors of the Argentine Grand Prix to back out of the race; and the race was initially postponed five weeks before it was due to take place; and then the Argentine political situation was problematic and they also entered a brief war with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands in early April, and within the context of an entirely European sport that consisted mostly of British organizations, this caused the Argentine organizers&#x27; contract to be terminated. An attempt to bring back the Argentine Grand Prix to the same circuit in Buenos Aires in 1986 did not work out, and the race did not return for nine years.

====1995–1998====

A private consortium purchased the Buenos Aires track in 1991, renamed it and began to upgrade it. They secured a place on the 1994 F1 season calendar, but the race (set for October) was aborted to continue modernization. The general layout was not changed, but an &quot;S&quot; chicane named after Ayrton Senna was added. The No. 6 arena circuit was used, which did not include the flat-out lake run. This tight, twisty circuit was not well suited to Formula One cars and it was very difficult to pass on this variant because of the corners being so close together. The modernized Argentine Grand Prix returned in , with victory going to Damon Hill. Hill won the event again in (his championship season), and in Jacques Villeneuve won the race in his championship season.

The organizers of the event ran into financial difficulties, and the race was the last running of the Argentine Grand Prix, the checkered flag waving victory to Michael Schumacher, in his ninth win for Ferrari.

====Absence====

A race was scheduled for 1999, but was cancelled pre-season, leaving a five-week gap between the opening two rounds of the 1999 championship.

In February 2012, Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced that negotiations were coming to a close to bring the Grand Prix back to the country by 2013, this time at a street circuit to be created in the seaside resort city of Mar del Plata, scotching stories which surfaced in December 2011 that suggested a new circuit, being constructed at Zárate, was to target F1. Contracts were expected to be signed in May 2012, but this did not happen. Bernie Ecclestone, commercial rights holder of Formula One, said &quot;we are open to racing in Argentina when I can deal with serious people&quot;.

<doc id="1145094" wikidata="Q112333076" url="?curid=1145094" title="Silabenzene">
<text>A silabenzene is a heteroaromatic compound containing one or more silicon atoms instead of carbon atoms in benzene. A single substitution gives silabenzene proper; additional substitutions give a disilabenzene (3 theoretical isomers), trisilabenzene (3 isomers), etc.

Silabenzenes have been the targets of many theoretical and synthetic studies by organic chemists interested in the question of whether analogs of benzene with Group IV elements heavier than carbon, e.g., silabenzene, stannabenzene and germabenzene—so-called &quot;heavy benzenes&quot;—exhibit aromaticity.

Although several heteroaromatic compounds bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms have been known since the early stages of organic chemistry, silabenzene had been considered to be a transient, un-isolable compound and was detected only in low-temperature matrices or as its Diels-Alder adduct for a long time. In recent years, however, a kinetically stabilized silabenzene and other heavy aromatic compounds with silicon or germanium atoms have been reported.

==Synthesis==

Several attempts to synthesize stable silabenzenes have been reported from the late 1970s using well-known bulky substituents such as a &quot;tert&quot;-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) or a TMS (trimethylsilyl) group, but such silabenzenes readily react with themselves to give the corresponding dimer even at low temperature (below -100°C) due to the high reactivity of silicon-carbon &quot;π&quot; bonds. In 1978 Barton and Burns reported that flow pyrolysis of 1methyl-1allyl-1silacyclohexa-2,4diene through a quartz tube heated to 428 °C using either ethyne or perfluoro-2-butyne as both a reactant and a carrier gas afforded the methyl-1silylbenzene Diel-Alder adducts, 1methyl-1sila­bicyclo[2.2.2]­octatriene or 1methyl-2,3bis(trifluoromethyl)-1sila­bicyclo[2.2.2]­octatriene, respectively, by way of a retro-ene reaction.

A computational investigation in 2013 points out a new route to stable silabenzenes at ambient conditions through Brook rearrangement. The [1,3]-Si → O shift of TMS or triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) substituted precursors with tetrahedral silicon atoms to an adjacent carbonyl oxygen lead to aromatic Brook-type silabenzenes.

Following the synthesis of the naphthalene analog 2-silanaphthalene, the first sila-aromatic compound, by Norihiro Tokitoh and Renji Okazaki in 1997, the same group reported thermally stable silabenzene in 2000 taking advantage of a new steric protective group. A 9-silaanthracene derivative has been reported in 2002, a 1-silanaphthalene also in 2002.

A 1,4-disilabenzene was reported in 2002. In 2007, 1,2-disilabenzene was synthesized via formal [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization of a disilyne (Si-Si triple bonded species) and phenylacetylene.

Some theoretical studies suggest that the symmetric 1,3,5-trisilabenzene may be more stable than 1,2-disilabenzene.

==Properties and reactions==
Isolated silabenzene reacts with various reagents at 1,2- or 1,4-positions to give diene-type products, so the aromaticity of the silabenzene is destroyed. It is different from benzene, which reacts with electrophiles to give not dienes but substituted benzenes, so benzene sustains its aromaticity. Silicon is a semi-metal element, so the Si-C &quot;π&quot; bond in the silabenzene is highly polarized and easily broken. The silabenzene is also light-sensitive; Ultraviolet irradiation gives the valence isomer, a silabenzvalene. The theoretical calculations and the NMR chemical shifts of silabenzenes, though, show that silabenzene is an aromatic compound in spite of the different reactivity from benzene and other classical aromatic compounds.

==Hexasilabenzene==
In calculations the all-silicon hexasilabenzene Si6H6 is predicted to have 6-fold symmetry or a chair conformation. It was shown that the deviation from planarity in hexasilabenzene is caused by the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect. A stable hexasilaprismane has been known since 1993 A compound isomeric with hexasilabenzene was first reported in 2010. This compound is reported as stable and with according to X-ray crystallography a chairlike tricyclic silicon frame.

The searching of a planar Si6 analogue to benzene has been extended to anionic cycles and structures bearing lithium atoms replacing hydrogens. Through Density functional theory calculations, it has been shown that from a series of planar and tridimensional structures with molecular formula Si6Li2-8, the global minimum is a Si6Li6 planar ring. This particular ring has D2h symmetry with 4 lithium cations placed between two adjacent silicon atoms –forming three-center two-electron bonds –and two more Li cations located above and below the center of the ring’s plane. A highly symmetric D6h structure analogue to hexalithiumbenzene was found to be higher in energy by 2.04 eV to respect to the minimum.
Aromaticity was also tested using density functional calculations. DFT can be effectively used to calculate the aromaticity of various molecular systems using the B3LYP hybrid density functional; this method has been proved to be the method of choice for computing delocalized systems. The nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) was selected as the quantitative criterion to evaluate the aromatic character of the structures under study. The global minimum (D2h symmetry ring) and the D6h symmetry ring show values of −3.95 and −5.95, respectively. In NICS calculations, negative values indicate aromaticity.
More recently, using a novel genetic algorithm, a Si6Li6 three dimensional structure has been calculated to be more stable than planar isomers.

<text>Moving Hearts is an Irish Celtic rock band formed in 1981. They followed in the footsteps of Horslips in combining Irish traditional music with rock and roll, and also added elements of jazz to their sound.

==Career==
The group was formed in 1981 when Dónal Lunny (bouzouki) and Christy Moore (vocals, guitar and bodhrán), of Planxty, wanted to explore the possibilities of linking contemporary music to Irish traditional music. They initially intended to form a trio with guitarist Declan Sinnott, but then expanded the group to include established Irish musicians Keith Donald (alto sax), Eoghan O&#x27;Neill (bass), Brian Calnan (drums), and Davy Spillane (uilleann pipes). In their first year together, Moving Hearts performed to packed audiences during their three-night-a-week residency at the Baggot Inn on Baggot Street in Dublin.

This laid the basis for a powerful, new Irish sound, which was coupled on the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Moving Hearts&quot; and &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot;, with songs of explicit political engagement, often concerning the situation in Northern Ireland. The band was organised as a cooperative effort, with all profits and costs borne by the seven band members and three members of the road crew.

Calnan was replaced for the group&#x27;s second album by Matt Kelleghan, and, in 1982, Moore left to pursue his solo career and was replaced by Mick Hanly.

Moving Hearts played many prestigious gigs including the Montreux Jazz Festival, The Bottom Line in New York and the Lorient Festival in Brittany, and the line-up with Hanly was recorded on the 1983 album &quot;Live Hearts&quot;. They also played on two tracks on Van Morrison&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;A Sense of Wonder&quot;.

For a period after Hanly&#x27;s departure, Flo McSweeney and Anthony Drennan came in on vocals and lead guitar. The following year the group performed as an instrumental group, recording the album, &quot;The Storm&quot;. At this point the line-up consisted of Spillane and Declan Masterson on uilleann pipes, Lunny on bouzouki, synthesiser &amp; bodhrán, Donald on sax, Noel Eccles on percussion, Matt Kelleghan on drums, O&#x27;Neill on bass and Greg Boland on guitar.

The group ceased touring in 1984, appearing only at occasional festivals such as the Preseli Folk Festival–now the Fishguard Folk Festival–in 1986. In 1990, the band performed at Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre for a sold out farewell concert, with McSweeney on vocals.

Moving Hearts re-formed in 2007, announcing concerts in Dublin and at the Hebridean Celtic Festival in Stornoway. The new line-up was: Lunny, Spillane, O&#x27;Neill, Donald, Kellaghan, Eccles, Drennan, Kevin Glackin and Graham Henderson.

They continue to reunite for occasional concerts every few years. The 2022 line up is Lunny, Spillane, Donald, O&#x27;Neill, Eccles, Drennan, Bradley and Henderson.
