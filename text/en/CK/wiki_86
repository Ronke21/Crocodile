<text>A peritonsillar abscess (PTA), also known as a quinsy, is an accumulation of pus due to an infection behind the tonsil. Symptoms include fever, throat pain, trouble opening the mouth, and a change to the voice. Pain is usually worse on one side. Complications may include blockage of the airway or aspiration pneumonitis.
PTA is typically due to infection by a number of types of bacteria. Often it follows streptococcal pharyngitis. They do not typically occur in those who have had a tonsillectomy. Diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms. Medical imaging may be done to rule out complications.
Treatment is by removing the pus, antibiotics, sufficient fluids, and pain medication. Steroids may also be useful. Admission to hospital is generally not needed. In the United States about 3 per 10,000 people per year are affected. Young adults are most commonly affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
Physical signs of a peritonsillar abscess include redness and swelling in the tonsillar area of the affected side and swelling of the jugulodigastric lymph nodes. The uvula may be displaced towards the unaffected side.

Unlike tonsillitis, which is more common in children, PTA has a more even age spread, from children to adults. Symptoms start appearing two to eight days before the formation of an abscess. A progressively severe sore throat on one side and pain during swallowing (odynophagia) usually are the earliest symptoms. As the abscess develops, persistent pain in the peritonsillar area, fever, a general sense of feeling unwell, headache, and a distortion of vowels informally known as &quot;hot potato voice&quot; may appear. Neck pain associated with tender, swollen lymph nodes, referred ear pain and foul breath are also common. While these signs may be present in tonsillitis itself, a PTA should be specifically considered if there is limited ability to open the mouth (trismus).

===Complications===
While most people recover uneventfully, there is a wide range of possible complications. These may include:
* Retropharyngeal abscess
* Extension of abscess in other deep neck spaces leading to airway compromise (see Ludwig&#x27;s angina)
* Airway obstruction
* Aspiration pneumonitis 
* Lung abscess (following rupture)
* Sepsis
* Life-threatening hemorrhage (following erosion or septic necrosis into the carotid sheath of the neck)
* Glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever (chronic complications of strep throat)

Difficulty swallowing can lead to decreased oral intake and dehydration.

==Causes==
PTA usually arises as a complication of an untreated or partially treated episode of acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these cases, spreads to the peritonsillar area (peritonsillitis). This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to formation of an abscess. PTA can also occur &quot;&quot;. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be causative. Commonly involved aerobic pathogens include &quot;Streptococcus, Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Haemophilus&quot;. The most common anaerobic species include &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot;, &quot; Peptostreptococcus&quot;, &quot;Prevotella species&quot;, and &quot;Bacteroides&quot;.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms. Medical imaging may be done to rule out complications. Medical imaging may include CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound is also useful in diagnosis.

==Treatment==
Medical treatment with antibiotics, volume repletion with fluids, and pain medication is usually adequate, although in cases where airway obstruction or systemic sepsis occurs, surgical drainage may be necessary. Corticosteroids may also be useful. Admission to hospital is generally not needed.

===Medication===
The infection is frequently penicillin resistant. There are a number of antibiotics options including amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, or metronidazole in combination with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) or penicillin V. Piperacillin/tazobactam may also be used.

===Surgery===
The pus can be removed by a number of methods including needle aspiration, incision and drainage, and tonsillectomy. Incision and drainage may be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration but the evidence is very uncertain. Needle aspiration may be less painful but again the evidence is very uncertain.

Treatment can also be given while a patient is under anesthesia, but this is usually reserved for children or anxious patients. Tonsillectomy can be indicated if a patient has recurring peritonsillar abscesses or a history of tonsillitis. For patients with their first peritonsillar abscess most ENT-surgeons prefer to &quot;wait and observe&quot; before recommending tonsillectomy.

==Epidemiology==
It is a commonly encountered otorhinolaryngological (ENT) emergency.

The number of new cases per year of peritonsillar abscess in the United States has been estimated approximately at 30 cases per 100,000 people. In a study in Northern Ireland, the number of new cases was 10 cases per 100,000 people per year.
In Denmark, the number of new cases is higher and reaches 41 cases per 100,000 people per year. Younger children who develop a peritonsillar abscess are often immunocompromised and in them, the infection can cause airway obstruction.

==Etymology==
The condition is often referred to as &quot;quincy&quot;, &quot;quinsy&quot;, or &quot;quinsey&quot;, anglicised versions of the French word &quot;esquinancie&quot; which was originally rendered as squinsey and subsequently quinsy.

==Notable cases==
* Sultan Tekish of Kwarezm
* Osceola
* Michel de Montaigne
* Dan Minogue, the captain/coach of Australian Rules football team Richmond was rumoured to be dead a week before the 1920 VFL Grand Final, but in fact, was in his hometown of Bendigo recovering from quinsy.
* Eiichiro Oda, author of the best-selling &quot;One Piece&quot; manga, was hospitalized due to complications.
* Ian Maclaren died of complications from quinsy while on a lecture tour of the United States.

The ancient Roman goddess Angerona was claimed to cure quinsy (Latin &quot;angina&quot;) in humans and sheep.

<text>The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a compilation album by Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 11 May 1998.

Cave asked each of the Bad Seeds members, past and present, to choose their favourite tracks from the ten albums—their lists would then be discussed until a final list was produced. Only guitarist and founding Bad Seed Mick Harvey responded, and it is his listing, unchanged, that makes up &quot;The Best of&quot;.

As of 2001, the album has sold 500,000 copies worldwide.

<doc id="1145116" wikidata="Q1526499" url="?curid=1145116" title="Climbing Mount Improbable">
<text>Climbing Mount Improbable is a 1996 popular science book by Richard Dawkins. The book is about probability and how it applies to the theory of evolution. It is designed to debunk claims by creationists about the probability of naturalistic mechanisms like natural selection.

The main metaphorical treatment is of a geographical landscape upon which evolution can ascend only gradually and cannot climb cliffs (that is known as an adaptive landscape). In the book, Dawkins gives ideas about a seemingly complex mechanism coming about from many gradual steps that were previously unseen.

The book grew out of the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, which Dawkins delivered in 1991 (see &quot;Growing Up in the Universe&quot;). It is illustrated by Dawkins&#x27; wife at the time, Lalla Ward, and is dedicated to Robert Winston, &quot;a good doctor and a good man&quot;.

<text>Yaxley is a village and civil parish in the Huntingdonshire district in Cambridgeshire, England. Yaxley lies approximately south of Peterborough, just off the A15 road. The village is located near the Hampton township, and is approximately three miles northeast of junction 16 of the A1(M) at Norman Cross.

== History ==
Yaxley was listed as &quot;Lacheslei&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire. In 1086 there was one manor at Yaxley and 39 households.

The Church of England Parish Church of St Peter is a Grade I listed building.

Norman Cross Prison, the earliest known prisoner-of-war camp, was constructed between Yaxley and the villages of Folksworth and Stilton from 1796-97 for the purpose of holding captured troops during the French Revolutionary Wars.

== Government ==

As a civil parish, Yaxley has a parish council. The parish council is elected by the residents of the parish who have registered on the electoral roll; the parish council is the lowest tier of government in England. A parish council is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including allotments and a cemetery; grass cutting and tree planting within public open spaces such as a village green or playing fields. The parish council reviews all planning applications that might affect the parish and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the local planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises its own tax to pay for these services, known as the parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax.

Yaxley was in the constituency of Huntingdonshire from 1290 until 1885 and again from 1918 until 1965, with it being part of the constituency of Ramsey during the intermittent years. Prior to this, Yaxley was located within the hundred of Norman Cross within Huntingdonshire from as early as the 10th century. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Yaxley became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire. Yaxley was represented by the rural district of Norman Cross from 1894 until the district was abolished under the Local Government Act.

The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council which is a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire and has its headquarters in Huntingdon. Huntingdonshire District Council has 52 councillors representing 29 district wards. Huntingdonshire District Council collects the council tax, and provides services such as building regulations, local planning, environmental health, leisure and tourism. Yaxley is a part of the district ward of &quot;Yaxley and Farcet&quot; and is represented on the district council by three councillors. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council.

For Yaxley the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, education, social services, libraries and heritage services. Cambridgeshire County Council consists of 61 councillors representing 59 electoral divisions. Yaxley is part of the electoral division of &quot;Yaxley and Farcet&quot; and is represented on the county council by one councillor. Councillor Mac McGuire of the Conservatives, who previously represented Sawtry from 1985 to 1992, represented Yaxley from 1997 until his death was announced in January 2024. The current councillor is Liberal Democrat Andrew Wood, whom was elected in March 2024.

<text>Association Sportive de Saint-Étienne Loire (), abbreviated as A.S.S.E. () and commonly known as Saint-Étienne, is a French professional football club based in Saint-Étienne, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. The club was founded in 1933 and competes in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Saint-Étienne&#x27;s home ground is the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

Saint-Étienne have won ten Ligue 1 titles, six Coupe de France titles, a Coupe de la Ligue title and five Trophée des Champions. They have also won the Ligue 2 championship on three occasions. The club achieved most of its honours in the 1960s and 1970s under the leadership of managers Jean Snella, Albert Batteux, and Robert Herbin. In 1976, the club reached the final of the UEFA Champions League.

Saint-Étienne is known as &quot;Les Verts&quot; meaning &quot;the Greens&quot; due to its home colours. They have a longstanding rivalry with nearby team Olympique Lyonnais, against whom they contest the &quot;Derby Rhône-Alpes&quot;. In 2009, the club added a female section.

== History ==
===Early history===
AS Saint-Étienne was founded in 1919 by employees of the Saint-Étienne-based grocery store chain Groupe Casino under the name Amicale des Employés de la Société des Magasins Casino (ASC). The club adopted green as its primary color mainly due to it being the principal colour of Groupe Casino. In 1920, due to the French Football Federation (FFF) prohibiting the use of trademarks in sports club, the club dropped &quot;Casino&quot; from its name and changed its name to simply Amical Sporting Club to retain the ASC acronym. In 1927, Pierre Guichard took over as president of the club and, after merging with local club Stade Forézien Universitaire, changed its name to Association sportive Stéphanoise.

In July 1930, the National Council of the FFF voted 128–20 in support of professionalism in French football. In 1933, Stéphanoise turned professional and changed its name to its current version. The club was inserted into the second division and became inaugural members of the league after finishing runner-up in the South Group. Saint-Étienne remained in Division 2 for four more seasons before earning promotion to Division 1 for the 1938–39 season under the leadership of the Englishman Teddy Duckworth. However, the team&#x27;s debut appearance in the first division was short-lived due to the onset of World War II. Saint-Étienne returned to the first division after the war under the Austrian-born Frenchman Ignace Tax and surprised many by finishing runner-up to Lille in the first season after the war. The club failed to improve upon that finish in following seasons under Tax and, ahead of the 1950–51 season, Tax was let go and replaced by former Saint-Étienne player Jean Snella.

===Ten league titles (1956–1981)===

Under Snella, Saint-Étienne achieved its first honour after winning the Coupe Charles Drago in 1955. Two seasons later, the club won its first domestic league title. Led by goalkeeper Claude Abbes, defender Robert Herbin, as well as midfielders René Ferrier and Kees Rijvers and striker Georges Peyroche, Saint-Étienne won the league by four points over Lens. In 1958, Saint-Étienne won the Coupe Drago for the second time. After the following season, in which the club finished sixth, Snella departed the club. He was replaced by René Vernier. In the team&#x27;s first season under Vernier, Saint-Étienne finished 12th, the club&#x27;s worst finish since finishing 11th eight seasons ago. In the following season, François Wicart joined the coaching staff. In 1961, Roger Rocher became president of the club and quickly became one of the club&#x27;s chief investors. After two seasons under Wicart, Saint-Étienne were relegated after finishing 17th in the 1961–62 season. However, Wicart did lead the club to its first Coupe de France title in 1962, alongside co-manager Henri Guérin with the team defeating Nancy 1–0 in the final. He also led the club back to Division 1 after one season in the second division, but after the season, Wicart was replaced by Snella, who returned as manager after a successful stint in Switzerland with Servette.

In Snella&#x27;s first season back, Saint-Étienne won its second league title and, three seasons later, captured its third. Snella&#x27;s third and final title with the club coincided with the arrival of Georges Bereta, Bernard Bosquier, Gérard Farison and Hervé Revelli to the team. After the season, Snella returned to Servette and former Reims manager Albert Batteux replaced him. In Batteux&#x27;s first season in 1967–68, Saint-Étienne captured the double after winning the league and the Coupe de France. In the next season, Batteux won the league and, in the ensuing season, won the double again. The club&#x27;s fast rise into French football led to a high-level of confidence from the club&#x27;s ownership and supporters and, following two seasons without a trophy, Batteux was let go and replaced by former Saint-Étienne player Robert Herbin.

In Herbin&#x27;s first season in charge, Saint-Étienne finished fourth in the league and reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. In the next two seasons, the club won the double, its seventh and eighth career league title and its third and fourth Coupe de France title. In 1976, Saint-Étienne became the first French club since Reims in 1959 to reach the final of the European Cup. In the match, played at Hampden Park in Scotland, Saint-Étienne faced German club Bayern Munich, who were the reigning champions and arguably the world&#x27;s best team at the time. The match was hotly contested with Saint-Étienne failing to score after numerous chances by Jacques Santini, Dominique Bathenay and Osvaldo Piazza, among others. A single goal by Franz Roth eventually decided the outcome and Saint-Étienne supporters departed Scotland in tears, however, not without nicknaming the goalposts &quot;les poteaux carrés&quot; (&quot;the square posts&quot;). Saint-Étienne did earn a consolation prize by winning the league to cap off a successful season and, in the following season, the team won the Coupe de France. In 1981, Saint-Étienne, captained by Michel Platini, won its final league title to date after winning the league for the tenth time. After two more seasons in charge, Herbin departed the club for archrivals Lyon.

===Decline and recent history===
In 1982, a financial scandal involving a controversial slush fund led to the departure and eventual jailing of long-time president Roger Rocher. Saint-Étienne subsequently suffered a free-fall with the club suffering relegation in the 1983–84 season. The club returned to the first division in 1986 under the leadership of goalkeeper Jean Castaneda who had remained with the club, despite its financial state. Saint-Étienne kept its place in the first division for nearly a decade with the club reaching the semi-finals of the Coupe de France in 1990 and 1993 during the stint. In 1996, Saint-Étienne was relegated to the second division and returned to Division 1 in 1999. In the 2000–01 season, the club was supervised by five different managers and had to deal with a scandal that involved two players (Brazilian Alex Dias and Ukrainian goalkeeper Maksym Levytsky) who utilised fake Portuguese and Greek passports. Both players were suspended for four months and, at the end of a judicial inquiry, which linked some of the club&#x27;s management staff to the passport forgeries, Saint-Étienne was docked seven league points and relegated.

Saint-Étienne played three seasons in the second division and returned to the first division, now called Ligue 1, for the 2004–05 season. They came fifth in the 2007–08 season, which resulted in the club qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time since 1982. Saint-Étienne was influenced by several youngsters within the team such as Bafétimbi Gomis, Loïc Perrin, Blaise Matuidi and Dimitri Payet. The club followed up its fifth-place finish by finishing 17th in the next two seasons.

Having won the Coupe de la Ligue in April 2013, their first major domestic trophy for more than 30 years, Saint-Étienne qualified for the third preliminary round of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League campaign. Following crowd trouble towards the end of the 2012–13 season, Saint-Étienne were handed a one-match stadium ban which would have forced the team to open their campaign behind closed doors. However, on 23 July 2013, this ban was lifted. On 30 November 2014, Saint-Etienne defeated fierce rivals Lyon 3–0 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard for the first time since 1994.

The 2017–18 Ligue 1 season started badly for Saint-Etienne and culminated in a 5–0 derby loss to Lyon, after which Óscar García Junyent was dismissed as manager and replaced by former player Julien Sablé. Sable was replaced in December by Jean-Louis Gasset because he did not hold the required qualifications to coach in Ligue 1, and the club were fined €25,000 for every game played with Sable in charge. Under Gasset, Saint-Etienne went 13 games unbeaten and finished 7th in the table at the end of the season.

In the 2018–19 season, Saint-Etienne came fourth, the best finish since their promotion, after which Gasset elected to leave the club. The following year they were 17th when the season was ended by the coronavirus pandemic. They also reached the Coupe de France final in this season, which they lost 1–0 to Paris Saint-Germain.

In the 2020–21 season, Saint-Etienne started poorly and hovered above the relegation zone for most of the season before winning five of their last ten matches to finish 11th on the table. During that season, the club&#x27;s board of directors announced, in a public letter on 14 April 2021, that the club was up for sale.

During the beginning of the 2021–22, the team suffered a catastrophic record; the culmination of 12 consecutive games without a win in Ligue 1. On 5 December 2021, after a 5–0 defeat against Rennes, manager Claude Puel was relieved from his duties. Julien Sablé, the assistant coach, took over as caretaker manager, before Pascal Dupraz was appointed as the new manager on 15 December 2021. The team eventually finished 18th in the season, and were relegated to the Ligue 2 after losing in a penalty shootout to Auxerre in the relegation play-offs. Saint-Etienne was sanctioned with a deduction of three points and four matches behind closed doors after serious incidents that occurred on the field after the game. With a total of 18 points at the half of the 2022–23 season, Saint-Étienne was in the relegation zone ranked 18th in the table; however, they managed to finish the campaign in 8th place. The incidents led to over 30 people injured.
The 2022–23 season was also the first season of Saint-Etienne with their new logo.
In the 2023–24 Ligue 2 season, Saint-Etienne finished inside the playoff places and would eventually reach the relegation/promotion playoff against Metz. Saint-Etienne would win the two legged playoff 4-3 on aggregate to earn promotion back to Ligue 1.

<text>In psychoanalysis, psychosexual development is a central element of the sexual drive theory. According to Freud, personality develops through a series of childhood stages in which pleasure seeking energies from the child become focused on certain erogenous areas. An erogenous zone is characterized as an area of the body that is particularly sensitive to stimulation. The five psychosexual stages are the oral, the anal, the phallic, the latent, and the genital. The erogenous zone associated with each stage serves as a source of pleasure. Being unsatisfied at any particular stage can result in fixation. On the other hand, being satisfied can result in a healthy personality. Sigmund Freud proposed that if the child experienced frustration at any of the psychosexual developmental stages, they would experience anxiety that would persist into adulthood as a neurosis, a functional mental disorder.

== Background ==
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) observed that during the predictable stages of early childhood development, the child&#x27;s behavior is oriented towards certain parts of their body, for example the mouth during breast-feeding or the anus during toilet-training. In psychoanalysis, the adult neurosis (functional mental disorder) is thought to be rooted in fixations or conflicts encountered during the developmental stages of childhood sexuality. According to Freud, human beings are born &quot;polymorphous perverse&quot;: infants can derive sexual pleasure from any part of their bodies and any object. Over time the socialization process channels the (originally non-specific) libido into its more fixed mature forms. Given the predictable timeline of childhood behavior, he proposed &quot;libido development&quot; as a model of normal childhood sexual development, wherein the child progresses through five psychosexual stagesthe oral; the anal; the phallic; the latent; and the genitalin which the source pleasure is in a different erogenous zone.

== Freudian psychosexual development ==

Sexual infantilism: in pursuing and satisfying their libido (sexual drive), the child might experience failure (parental and societal disapproval) and thus might associate anxiety with the given erogenous zone. To avoid anxiety, the child becomes fixated, preoccupied with the psychological themes related to the erogenous zone in question. The fixation persists into adulthood and underlies the personality and psychopathology of the individual. It may manifest as mental ailments such as neurosis, hysteria, &quot;female hysteria&quot;, or personality disorder.

=== Id, Ego, and Superego ===

===Oral stage===
The first stage of psychosexual development is the oral stage, spanning from birth until the age of one year, wherein the infant&#x27;s mouth is the focus of libidinal gratification derived from the pleasure of feeding at the mother&#x27;s breast, and from the oral exploration of their environment, i.e. the tendency to place objects in the mouth. The child focuses on nursing, with the intrinsic pleasure of sucking and accepting things into the mouth. Since the ego is not developed beyond the most rudimentary form at this stage, every action is based upon the pleasure principle of the id. Nonetheless, the infantile ego is in the process of forming during the oral stage. In developing a body image, infants are aware of themselves as discrete from the external world; for example, the child understands pain when it is applied to their body, thus identifying the physical boundaries between body and environment. The experience of delayed gratification leads to understanding that specific behaviors satisfy some needs; for example, crying gratifies certain needs.

Weaning is the key experience in the infant&#x27;s oral stage of psychosexual development, their first feeling of loss consequent to losing the physical intimacy of feeding at their mother&#x27;s breast. The child is not only deprived of the sensory pleasures of nursing but also of the psychological pleasure of being cared for, mothered, and held. However, weaning increases the infant&#x27;s self-awareness, through learning that they do not control their environment. The experience of delayed gratification leads to the formation of capacities for &quot;independence&quot; (awareness of the limits of the self) and &quot;trust&quot; (behaviors leading to gratification). Thwarting of the oral-stage – too much or too little gratification of desire – might lead to an oral-stage fixation, which can be the root of neurotic tendencies in the developed personality. In the case of too much gratification, the child does not adequately learn that they do not control the environment, and that gratification is not always immediate, thereby forming an immature personality. In the case of too little gratification, the infant might become passive upon learning that gratification is not forthcoming, despite having produced the gratifying behavior.

===Anal stage===

The second stage of psychosexual development is the anal stage, spanning from the age of eighteen months to three years, wherein the infant&#x27;s erogenous zone changes from the mouth (the upper digestive tract) to the anus (the lower digestive tract), while ego formation continues. Toilet training is the child&#x27;s key anal-stage experience, occurring at about the age of two years. It involves conflict between the id (demanding immediate gratification) and the ego (demanding delayed gratification) in eliminating bodily wastes, and handling related activities (e.g. manipulating excrement, coping with parental demands). The child may respond with defiance, resulting in an &#x27;anal expulsive character&#x27;—often messy, reckless, and defiant—or with retention, leading to an &#x27;anal retentive character&#x27;—typically neat, precise, and passive-aggressive. The style of parenting influences the resolution of the conflict, which can be either gradual and psychologically uneventful, or which can be sudden and psychologically traumatic.

The ideal resolution of the conflict is that the child adjusts to moderate parental demands that teach the value and importance of physical cleanliness and environmental order, thus producing a self-controlled adult. The outcome of this stage can permanently affect the individual&#x27;s propensities toward possession and attitudes toward authority. If the parents make immoderate demands of the child, by too strictly enforcing toilet training, it might lead to the development of a compulsive personality, a person too concerned with neatness and order. If the parents consistently allow the child to indulge the impulse, the child might develop a self-indulgent personality characterized by personal slovenliness and environmental disorder.

===Phallic stage===
The third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage, spanning the ages of three to six years, wherein the child&#x27;s genitalia are their primary erogenous zone. It is in this third infantile development stage that children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents; they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring each other as well as their genitals, and so learn the physical (sexual) differences between male and female and their associated social roles. In the phallic stage, a boy&#x27;s decisive psychosexual experience is the Oedipus complex—his son–father competition for possession of his mother. The name derives from the 5th-century BC Greek mythologic character Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and sexually possessed his mother. In the young male, the Oedipus conflict stems from his natural love for his mother, a love which becomes sexual as his libidinal energy transfers from the anal region to the genital. The boy observes that his father stands in the way of his love and desire for possession of his mother. He therefore feels aggression and envy towards his father, but also a fear that his (much stronger) rival will strike back at him. As the boy has noticed that women, his mother in particular, have no penises, he is particularly struck by the fear that his father will remove his penis too. This castration anxiety surpasses his desire for his mother, so the desire is repressed. Although the boy sees that he cannot possess his mother, he reasons that he can possess her vicariously by identifying with his father and becoming as much like him as possible: this identification is the primary experience guiding the boy&#x27;s entry into his appropriate sexual role in life. A lasting trace of the oedipal conflict is the superego, the voice of the father within the boy. By thus resolving his incestuous conundrum, the boy passes into the latency period, a period of libidinal dormancy.

Initially, Freud applied the theory of the Oedipus complex to the psychosexual development of boys, but later developed the female aspects of the theory as the &quot;feminine Oedipus attitude&quot; and the &quot;negative Oedipus complex&quot;. The feminine Oedipus complex has its roots in the little girl&#x27;s discovery that she, along with her mother and all other women, lack the penis which her father and other men possess. Her love for her father then becomes both erotic and envious, as she yearns for a penis of her own. She comes to blame her mother for her perceived castration, and is struck by penis envy, the apparent counterpart to the boy&#x27;s castration anxiety.

Freud&#x27;s student–collaborator, Carl Jung, coined the term &quot;Electra complex&quot; in 1913. The name derives from the 5th-century BC Greek mythologic character Electra, who plotted matricidal revenge with her brother Orestes, against their mother and stepfather, for the murder of their father. (cf. &quot;Electra&quot;, by Sophocles). According to Jung, a girl&#x27;s decisive psychosexual experience is her daughter–mother competition for psychosexual possession of her father. Freud rejected Jung&#x27;s term as psychoanalytically inaccurate: &quot;that what we have said about the Oedipus complex applies with complete strictness to the male child only, and that we are right in rejecting the term &#x27;Electra complex&#x27;, which seeks to emphasize the analogy between the attitude of the two sexes&quot;.

The resolution of the feminine Oedipus complex is less clear-cut than the resolution of the Oedipus complex in males. Freud stated that the resolution comes much later and is never truly complete. Just as the boy learned his sexual role by identifying with his father, so the girl learns her role by identifying with her mother in an attempt to possess her father vicariously. At the eventual resolution of the conflict, the girl passes into the latency period, though Freud implies that she always remains slightly fixated at the phallic stage.

Despite the mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child&#x27;s desires, the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity – &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;girl&quot; – that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become the focus of infantile libidinal energy. The boy focuses his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother, and focuses jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father – because it is he who sleeps with the mother. Seeking to be united with his mother, the boy desires the death of his father, but the ego, pragmatically based upon the reality principle, knows that the father is the stronger of the two males competing to possess the one female. Nevertheless, the boy remains ambivalent about his father&#x27;s place in the family, which is manifested as fear of castration by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile Id. &#x27;Penis envy&#x27; in the girl is rooted in anatomic fact: without a penis, she cannot sexually possess the mother, as the infantile id demands. As a result, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union toward the father; thus, she progresses towards heterosexual femininity that ideally culminates in bearing a child who replaces the absent penis. After the phallic stage, the girl&#x27;s psychosexual development includes transferring her primary erogenous zone from the infantile clitoris to the adult vagina. Freud considered a girl&#x27;s Oedipal conflict to be more emotionally intense than that of a boy, potentially resulting in a submissive woman of insecure personality.

In both sexes, defense mechanisms provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the Id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is &quot;repression&quot;, the blocking of anxiety-inducing impulses and ideas from the conscious mind. The second defense mechanism is &quot;Identification&quot;, by which the child incorporates, to their ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. The boy thus diminishes his castration anxiety, because his identification with the father reduces the rivalry and suggests the promise of a future potency. The girl identifies with the mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus they are not antagonists.

===Latency stage===

The fourth stage of psychosexual development is the latency stage (from the age of 6 until puberty), wherein the child consolidates the character habits they developed in the three earlier stages. Whether or not the child has successfully resolved the Oedipal conflict, the instinctual drives of the child are inaccessible to the ego, because they have been subject to the mechanism of repression during the phallic stage. Hence, because the drives are latent (hidden) and gratification is indefinitely delayed, the child must derive the pleasure of gratification from secondary process-thinking that directs the energy of the drives towards external activities, such as schooling, friendships, hobbies, etc. Any neuroses established during the latent stage of psychosexual development might derive from the inadequate resolution of the Oedipus conflict, or from the ego&#x27;s failure in attempts to direct the energies towards socially acceptable activities.

===Genital stage===

The fifth stage of psychosexual development is the genital stage (from puberty through adult life) and usually represents the greater part of a person&#x27;s life. Its aim is the psychological detachment and independence from the parents. In the genital stage the person confronts and seeks to resolve their remaining psychosexual childhood conflicts. As in the phallic stage, the genital stage is centered upon the genitalia, but the sexuality is consensual and adult, rather than solitary and infantile. The psychological difference between the phallic and genital stages is that the ego is established in the latter; the person&#x27;s concern shifts from primary-drive gratification (instinct) to applying secondary process-thinking to gratify desire symbolically and intellectually by means of friendships, a love relationship, family and adult responsibility.

== Criticisms ==
===Scientific===
According to Frank Cioffi, a criticism of the scientific validity of the psychoanalytical theory of human psychosexual development is that Freud was personally fixated upon human sexuality.

Freud stated that his patients commonly had memories and fantasies of childhood seduction. According to Frederick Crews, critics hold that these were more likely to have been constructs that Freud created and forced upon his patients.

===Feminist===

Some feminists criticize Freud&#x27;s psychosexual development theory as being sexist and phallocentric, arguing that it was overly informed by his own self-analysis. In response to the Freudian concept of penis envy in the development of the feminine Oedipus complex, the German Neo-Freudian psychoanalyst Karen Horney, counter-proposed that girls instead develop &quot;Power envy&quot; rather than penis envy. She also proposed the concept of &quot;womb and vagina envy&quot;, the male&#x27;s envy of the female ability to bear children. Some contemporary theorists suggest, in addition to this, the envy of the woman&#x27;s perceived right to be the kind parent.

===Anthropologic===

Contemporary cultural considerations have questioned the normative presumptions of the Freudian psychodynamic perspective that posits the son–father conflict of the Oedipal complex as universal and essential to human psychologic development.

The anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski&#x27;s studies of the Trobriand islanders challenged the Freudian proposal that psychosexual development (e.g. the Oedipus complex) was universal. He reported that in the insular matriarchal society of the Trobriand, boys are disciplined by their maternal uncles, not their fathers (impartial, avuncular discipline). In &quot;Sex and Repression in Savage Society&quot; (1927), Malinowski reported that boys dreamed of feared uncles, not of beloved fathers, thus, power – not sexual jealousy – is the source of Oedipal conflict in such non–Western societies. Furthermore, contemporary research confirms that although personality traits corresponding to the oral stage, the anal stage, the phallic stage, the latent stage, and the genital stage are observable, they remain undetermined as fixed stages of childhood, and as adult personality traits derived from childhood.

<text>The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) was one of the two smallest of the five major Scottish railway companies prior to the 1923 Grouping, operating in the north-east of the country. Formed in 1845, it carried its first passengers the from Kittybrewster, in Aberdeen, to Huntly on 20 September 1854. By 1867 it owned of line and operated over a further .

The early expansion was followed by a period of forced economy, but in the 1880s the railway was refurbished, express services began to run and by the end of that decade there was a suburban service in Aberdeen. The railway operated its main line between Aberdeen and and two routes west to , connections could be made at both Keith and Elgin for Highland Railway services to Inverness. There were other junctions with the Highland Railway at and , and at Aberdeen connections for journeys south over the Caledonian and North British Railways. Its eventual area encompassed the three Scottish counties of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Moray, with short lengths of line in Inverness-shire and Kincardineshire.

Fish from the North Sea ports and whisky from the distilleries of Speyside became important goods traffic. The Royal Family used the Deeside Line for travel to and from Balmoral Castle and when they were in residence a daily special &#x27;Messenger Train&#x27; ran from Aberdeen; for most of the railway&#x27;s life this was its only Sunday service. The company ran three hotels, and a network of feeder bus services was developed in the early 20th century. In 1923, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway as its Northern Scottish area, passing on of line and 122 steam locomotives, most of them 4-4-0 tender locomotives. The railway had several branches, but only its main line remains today as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line.
==History==

===Half way to Inverness, 1845–1858===

====Establishment and construction====

In 1845 the Great North of Scotland Railway was formed to build a railway from Aberdeen to Inverness. The proposed route, which needed few major engineering works, followed the River Don to Inverurie, via Huntly and Keith to a crossing of the River Spey, and then to Elgin and along the coast via Nairn to Inverness. Branch lines to Banff, Portsoy, Garmouth and Burghead would total . At the same time the Perth &amp; Inverness Railway proposed a direct route over the Grampian Mountains to Perth, and the Aberdeen, Banff &amp; Elgin Railway suggested a route that followed the coast to better serve the Banffshire and Morayshire fishing ports. Three private bills were presented to Parliament seeking permission to build a railway, but the Aberdeen, Banff &amp; Elgin failed to raise funds, and the Perth &amp; Inverness Railway was rejected because the railway would be at altitudes that approached and needed steep gradients. The Great North of Scotland Railway Act 1846 received royal assent on 26 June 1846.

In the aftermath of the railway mania railway companies became an unpopular investment and the necessary finance could not be raised. The company suggested at a meeting in November 1849 that whereas £650,000 was needed for a double-track railway from Aberdeen to Inverness, only £375,000 would be needed for a single-track railway from Kittybrewster, from Aberdeen, to Keith, halfway to Inverness. The meeting recommended that the bridges and works be built wide enough for a second track when this was needed. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit to Huntly, short of Keith, with William Cubitt as engineer. The severe winter the following year delayed work. Between Inverurie and Aberdeen the line took over the Aberdeenshire Canal, the purchase of which delayed construction as it was necessary to settle the claims of each shareholder individually.

====Opening====

After an inspection by the Board of Trade, the railway opened to goods on 12 September 1854 and approval for the carriage of passengers was given two days later. The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11 am. The number of passengers had grown to about 650 by the time the train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12 pm. Public services began the following day.

There were stations at:
*Buxburn ( after 1897)
*Dyce
*Kinaldie (open after 1 December)
*Kintore
*Inverury ( after 1866)
*Pitcaple
*Oyne
*Buchanstone (open after 1 December)
*Insch
*Wardhouse (open after 1 December)
*Kennethmont
*Gartly
*Huntly

The railway was single track with passing loops at the termini and at Kintore, Inverurie and Insch; the loop at Kittybrewster was clear of the platform to allow the locomotive to run round the carriages and push them into the station. A daily goods train took up to 3 hours 40 minutes for the , the goods to Aberdeen also carried passengers and mail and spared cattle a two-day drive to market. Initially there were three passenger services a day taking two hours, fares being old pence (d) a mile for first class and d for third; on one train a day in each direction it was possible to travel for the statutory fare of 1d a mile. Although cheaper than travelling by coach, these fares and the charges for the transport of goods were considered high but not reduced for thirty years.

The railway opened short of rolling stock as only half of the twelve locomotives and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall &amp; Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed to hold on to the lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.

====Waterloo, Keith and Inverness====

The Aberdeen Railway (AR) opened from the south to Ferryhill, south of Aberdeen, in April 1850. It had been previously arranged that the Aberdeen and Great North would amalgamate, but this was annulled that year and the Aberdeen was seeking alliances with railways to the south. In 1854 the AR opened its Guild Street terminus in Aberdeen and the Great North sought and obtained powers for a branch that followed the Aberdeenshire Canal from Kittybrewster to a terminus at Waterloo by the docks. The line was opened to goods traffic on 24 September 1855 and passengers on 1 April 1856. Kittybrewster station was rebuilt with through platforms and the offices moved to Waterloo station from premises at 75 Union Street. The stations were apart and a goods line was built though the docks linking the two railways, worked by horses as steam locomotives were prohibited.

The Inverness &amp; Nairn Railway was authorised in 1854 to build a railway from Inverness to Nairn. The Great North, still seeking to reach Inverness, had objected but withdrew after running rights over the railway were promised. The line was opened on 6 November 1855, and Inverness &amp; Elgin Junction Railway was formed to extend this line to Elgin. The Great North objected again, this time citing the expense of crossing the Spey, but withdrew after it was suggested that the cost of a bridge would be shared. The new company changed its name to Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway, but no final undertaking on running rights was made.

The extension of the Great North to Keith was opened on 10 October 1856, with two intermediate stations at and Grange. Initially five services a day ran between Aberdeen and Keith, taking between 2 hours 40 minutes and 3 hours 5 minutes, although the number of services was later reduced to four. The route between Nairn and Keith authorised on 21 July 1856 required less earthwork, reducing cost, but had steeper gradients than had originally been proposed, and the Great North contributed £40,000 towards a bridge over the Spey. The line reached Dalvey (near Forres) in 1857, and Keith on 18 August 1858. Three services a day ran the between Aberdeen and Inverness, increasing to five a day east of Keith, and the journey to Inverness took between 5 hours and 55 minutes and 6 hours 30 minutes. The Great North did not insist on running rights west of Keith, but through carriages were probably provided from the start.

===Expansion, 1854–1866===
====Formartine and Buchan Railway====

Permission to build a line to serve the fishing ports at Peterhead and Fraserburgh was received in 1846, but this lapsed during the financial collapse that had followed. Two rival bills were presented in 1856, one by the Formartine and Buchan Railway and backed by the Great North, and another by the Aberdeen, Peterhead &amp; Fraserburgh Railway. Both companies failed to obtain permission for two years, but in 1858 the Formartine and Buchan Railway was successful. A long railway from Dyce to Old Deer (renamed in 1867) opened on 18 July 1861 and the main line between Kittybrewster and Dyce was doubled. The branch was extended the to a station at Peterhead the following year and a long branch north from to Fraserburgh station opened on 24 April 1865. Three or four services a day ran between Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, with the trains dividing at Maud; travel times were between and hours. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

====Alford Valley Railway====
The Alford Valley Railway left the main line at Kintore for . The railway was authorised in 1856 with the backing of the Great North; most of the company&#x27;s directors were also on the board of the Great North. The line was steeply graded over a summit at Tillyfourie, at between 1 in 70 and 1 in 75. The line opened in 1859 with a service of four trains a day calling at , and . In 1862 the Great North guaranteed the company&#x27;s debts and it was subsequently absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

====Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway====

The branch from Inverurie, backed by local residents with funding from the Great North, was authorised on 15 June 1855. The official opening took place on 26 June 1856 with public services starting on 1 July. Journeys took from 18 to 20 minutes to cover the to Old Meldrum with a stop at ; a further station opened in 1866 at . In June 1858 the line was leased to the Great North for a rental of £650 per year (). The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

====Banff, Macduff and Turriff Railways====

Plans to reach fishing ports at Macduff and Banff from Inverurie were proposed when the Great North was first suggested, but failed because of the lack of financial support. A different route, from Milton Inveramsay, allowed for a shorter route with easier gradients. Unable to raise sufficient money for a line to the coast, a shorter line to was built. The Great North invested in the railway, and directors sat on the board of the Junction Railway. The new line, together with a junction station at , opened on 5 September 1857. A separate company, the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Extension Railway, built an extension to a station called . The line was operated by the Great North from 4 June 1860, and served an inconvenient terminus high on a hill from Macduff and from the bridge across the River Deveron to Banff. Four trains a day ran from Inveramsay, taking between 1 hour 30 minutes and 1 hour 50 minutes, with connections with services to Aberdeen. Both railways were absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line was extended to a new station in 1872.

====Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway====
The railway was authorised in 1857 from Grange, on the Great North main line, to Banff, with a branch from to . The chairman of the company, Thomas Bruce, was also deputy chairman of the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway, with the other directors being made up of local men; most of the investments were raised locally and in small amounts. Most of the line was built with gradients up to 1 in 70, but the half-mile of 1 in 30 goods line to the harbour at Portsoy was restricted to one locomotive and four wagons. The railway opened on 30 July 1859, with public services starting on 2 August following a derailment on the opening day. Services connected with the Great North at Grange. With the railway struggling to pay the interest on its debt, in 1863 the Great North took over running the services and the line renamed the Banffshire Railway. The Great North provided three trains a day between Grange and Banff that connected at Tillynaught for Portsoy, and two trains a day along the coast between Banff and Portsoy. Permission for a extension from Portsoy to Portgordon was given, but the necessary investment could not be found. Amalgamation with the Great North was authorised in 1866, but financial problems delayed this until 12 August 1867, and the Portgordon extension was abandoned.

====Keith and Dufftown Railway====

The Great North sought to have its own route west of Keith, with Grantown-on-Spey as an objective, where it hoped to meet any possible line between Perth and Inverness. To this end, it invested in the Keith and Dufftown Railway; this company was incorporated on 27 July 1857, but lack of money slowed progress. Powers for a longer, but cheaper, route between the two towns were secured on 25 May 1860. The revised route included steeper gradients than those planned in 1857; the maximum gradient was now 1 in 60 instead of 1 in 70. There was a viaduct over the Fiddich of two spans, and there were three intermediate stations: Earlsmill (renamed in 1897), Botriphnie (renamed in 1862) and . When the line opened on 21 February 1862, the trains were worked by the Great North under an agreement dating from the formation of the company. The railway was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866.

====Strathspey Railway====
With promises of substantial goods traffic of iron and timber and from the local whisky distilleries, extension of the line to Dufftown into Strathspey was sought and obtained on 17 May 1861. The Strathspey Railway was sponsored by the Keith &amp; Dufftown and Great North of Scotland Railways, who appointed directors to the board, and the Great North undertook to run the services. The line first headed north to meet an extension of the Morayshire Railway at Strathspey Junction (called from 1864), before following the River Spey to Abernethy. The Act also permitted a branch to the proposed Inverness &amp; Perth Junction Railway at Grantown-on-Spey. The gradients were not severe, but the route required the Spey and its tributaries to be crossed many times, with three bridges built over the river itself. The line was placed in cuttings greater than deep, and there was one long tunnel. The line was opened on 1 July 1863 to Abernethy (later called ). The line between Dufftown and Craigellachie became the main line and services continued over the Morayshire Railway, opening up a route between Keith and independent of the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR). The IAJR kept most of the through traffic as its line was more direct, only instead of via the Great North route. The Great North ran four trains a day from Elgin to Keith via Craigellachie, with through carriages or connections for three trains for Aberdeen at Keith. Connections at Elgin were poor because travel over the two routes took a different length of time.

The line from Craigellachie became a branch with three trains a day calling at all stations at an average speed of about . The link to Grantown-on-Spey was not built, but on 1 August 1866 services were extended to meet the IAJR (now the Highland Railway) at . The railways met north of Boat and conflict arose over the manning of the signalbox at the junction, with the Highland refusing to make any contribution. For a while between March and June 1868 Great North services terminated at Nethy Bridge, after which separate tracks side by side were provided for both companies to Boat. Prompt connections were available with the Great North at Craigellachie, but there was usually a long wait for connections with the Highland at Boat. The railway&#x27;s was absorbed by the Great North of Scotland Railway on 1 August 1866, and the line&#x27;s main source of income came from the local distilleries.

====Morayshire Railway====

A double-track railway had been proposed from Lossiemouth to Craigellachie in 1841 and necessary permissions granted in 1846, the route having changed to take advantage of the proposed Great North of Scotland Railway between Elgin and Orton. The financial situation delayed construction, but work eventually started on the section from Lossiemouth to Elgin in 1851. The line opened on 10 August 1852 with a special train from Elgin to festivities in Lossiemouth. Public services started the next day with five services a day, each taking 15 minutes with two request stops. First and second class accommodation was provided at d and 1d a mile. However, it was the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR) who was to build the line from Elgin to Orton; permission to build a branch from this line to Rothes was granted to the Morayshire on 14 July 1856. The IAJR built its own station at Elgin, linked to the Morayshire&#x27;s station by a junction to the east. The IAJR opened on 18 August 1858 and the Morayshire Railway started running services on 23 August.

Initially the Morayshire ran trains over the IAJR, but its lightweight locomotives struggled with the gradients and proved unreliable, and after six weeks carriages were attached and detached from IAJR trains at Elgin and Orton. Conflict arose over through ticketing, and the directors of the Morayshire responded with plans to build its own line between the two stations. The Great North sponsored the new line and offered to provide services after the lines had been physically connected. Permission was granted on 3 July 1860, goods were carried from 30 December 1861 and passengers from 1 January 1862, reducing the travel time from 55 to 45 minutes. The Morayshire station at Elgin was enlarged in anticipation of Great North services, albeit in wood.

In 1861 permission was granted to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission was given to the Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.
====Aberdeen joint station====

The wooden station building at Waterloo was a from the Aberdeen and Deeside&#x27;s Guild Street station and passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid for in the through fare and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The Great North refused to hold its trains to connect with those arriving at Guild Street and insisted that tickets were purchased at least five minutes before the train was due to depart. The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. This inconvenienced passengers, as was pointed out to the general manager during a parliamentary committee meeting by a member of parliament who had missed a connection, although his family and luggage had been sent on. The Great North promoted onward traffic by sea and approached the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company to see if rates could be reduced for through traffic and through ticketing by rail was not available until 1859, when the Great North joined the Railway Clearing House.

A joint line through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had approached the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness &amp; Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness &amp; Perth Junction and Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.

The Limpet Mill Scheme was a line presented in an 1862 bill by the nominally independent Scottish Northern Junction Railway, but supported by the SNER. This proposed a long railway between Limpet Mill, to the north of on the SNER, to the Great North at Kintore. A junction with the Deeside Railway was also planned, over which the SNER unsuccessfully tried to obtain running rights. Unpopular, this was given permission by parliament, but the Great North succeeded in inserting a clause that this would be suspended if it obtained an Act by 1 September 1863. The Great North proposed a route, known locally as the &quot;Circumbendibus&quot;, that was longer but cheaper than the direct route through the Denburn Valley. Despite local opposition, the route was approved by parliament in 1863, but was revoked the following year when the SNER obtained permission for a railway through the Denburn Valley. The Great North contributed the £125,000 that its Circumbendibus line would have cost and the SNER contributed £70,000 out of the £90,000 it had been prepared to advance the Limpet Mill Scheme. The SNER built the double-track railway, culverting the Denburn and digging two short tunnels. The joint station opened on 4 November 1867 and consisted of three through tracks, one with a long platform, together with two bay platforms for terminating trains at either end. Two lines to the west were provided for goods traffic, and the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street closed to passengers and became goods terminals. The line to the north of the station passed to the Great North and the long Hutcheon Street tunnel became its longest.

====Deeside Railway====

A railway to serve Deeside was authorised on 16 July 1846, but it was decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were still hard to find, but a line as far as Banchory was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside Railway used a horse to shunt wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen&#x27;s Guild Street station which opened the same year.

A new company, the Aboyne Extension, was formed to reach . Instead of building two bridges across the Dee, as had been proposed in 1846, the railway instead took a cheaper but longer route through Lumphanan, and services were extended over the new line on 2 December 1859. The Aboyne &amp; Braemar Railway was formed to build a line from Aboyne the to Braemar. The line was to follow the Dee before crossing it from Braemar, but the plans were modified to terminate the line at Bridge of Gairn with the passenger terminus short at . This route opened to Ballater on 17 October 1866, and the line to Bridge of Gairn remained unfinished. By 1855 there five services a day over the long line, taking between 1 hour 50 minutes and hours.

The Royal Family used the line from 1853 to travel to Balmoral Castle; in September 1866 the British Royal Train used Ballater station nearly a month before public services reached the station. At first Queen Victoria visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after Edward VII became king in 1901. From 8 October 1865 a daily &#x27;Messenger Train&#x27; ran when the Royal Family was at Balmoral. First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the SNER proposed a new line that crossed the Deeside Railway. Whilst in discussions with the SNER about a link from this new line to the Deeside, a lease for the Deeside Railway was offered to the Great North, which was rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne &amp; Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the Great North.

====Amalgamation====

After opening to Keith in 1854 the Great North of Scotland Railway operated over of line. Ten years later this had almost quadrupled but more than three-quarters was over leased or subsidiary railways. Eventual amalgamation with many of these railways had been prompted from the start. The necessary authority was sought and on 30 July 1866 the &quot;Great North of Scotland Railway (Amalgamation) Act&quot; received Royal Assent, this Act also permitting the Great North to lease the Deeside Railway. The other companies merged two days later, except the Banffshire and Morayshire, which had started as separate undertakings and were not included in the 1866 Act, although permission for the Banffshire to merge was gained the following year. After the extension of the Deeside opened in 1866 and the merger of the Banffshire the following year the Great North of Scotland Railway owned of line and operated over a further .

===Austerity, 1866–1879===
In 1855, the first full year after opening, the Great North of Scotland declared a dividend of per cent, which rose to the following year and 5 per cent in 1859. The dividend reached a maximum of per cent in 1862 before dropping to 7 per cent the following year and 5 per cent in 1864, but in 1865 the directors could not pay any dividend on ordinary shares. At the directors&#x27; suggestion a committee was set up to look into their actions; the report&#x27;s main recommendation was the abandonment of the Port Gordon extension. The opening of direct route over the Highland Railway to the south had lost the through mail business, resulting in the withdrawal of Sunday services, and had lost revenue equivalent to a five per cent dividend. Joining the Clearing House system had resulted in the loss of twenty-five per cent of goods traffic income and the conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen had been expensive and resulted in an overpriced lease on the Deeside. The collapse of Overend, Gurney and Company Bank in 1866 meant that for three months the bank rate rose to 10 per cent, making the company&#x27;s financial situation worse.

The whole board resigned and six members did not seek re-appointment. At the beginning of 1867 the company owed £800,000 () and the new board imposed austerity measures. It would be 1874 before most of the company&#x27;s debt was settled and it became possible to pay a dividend again. The only line built in the early 70s was the to Macduff and few carriages and no locomotives were built until 1876. The Deeside Railway merged in 1875, the Aboyne &amp; Braemar extension to Ballater in January 1876, and the Morayshire Railway was absorbed in 1880. After an engine boiler exploded at Nethy Bridge in September 1878, the inquiry found the testing of boilers infrequent and inadequate. It was sixteen months before the locomotive was repaired.

===Renaissance, 1879–1899===
====Renewal and extension====
In 1879 the chairman, Lord Provost Leslie, died and was replaced by William Ferguson of Kinmundy. The following year both the Secretary and General Manager resigned and William Moffatt was appointed to both posts, and A.G. Reid became Superintendent of the Line. The railway was now paying a dividend and seeing increased traffic, but rolling stock, track, signals and stations all needed replacing in a project that was to cost £250,000 (). By June 1880 the main line was doubled as far as Kintore, and over the next five years of iron rail track, much of it without fishplates, was replaced with steel rails and the main line doubled between Dyce and Inveramsay. The railway had acquired a reputation for running slow trains on a perverse timetable and ill-treating its passengers, and now resolved to address this. By the mid-1880s services were faster, there was upholstery in third class and the branches saw an accelerated service as a result of running fewer mixed trains.

On 27 November 1882 Inverythan Bridge on the Macduff Branch near collapsed as a locomotive hauling five goods wagons, a brake van and four carriages crossed. The locomotive and tender crossed the bridge, but the wagons and carriages fell to the road below, killing five people who had been travelling in the first and second carriages and injuring fifteen others. The Board of Trade report found that the collapse was due to an internal fault in a cast-iron beam that had been fitted when the bridge had been built in 1857.

A bill was introduced to parliament in 1881 to extend the line from Portsoy along the Moray Firth to Buckie, to be opposed by the Highland and rejected. The following year both the Great North and Highland railways applied to parliament, the Great North for a line from Portsoy along the coast through Buckie to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to Buckie and Cullen. Authority was granted, but in the case of the Highland Railway only for a line as far as Portessie, with running rights over the Great North coast line between Buckie and Portsoy and the Great North obtaining reciprocal rights over the Highland railway between Elgin and Forres. The coast line opened in stages, the outer sections from Portsoy to Tochieneal and Elgin to Garmouth opening in 1884. The centre section, which involved heavy engineering, with a long viaduct with a central span of over the Spey at Garmouth and embankments and viaducts at Cullen, opened in May 1886. The line was served by four trains a day and a fast through train from Aberdeen that reached Elgin in hours. The Highland Portessie branch had opened in 1884 and the Highland did not exercise its running rights over the Coast Line, thus preventing the Great North running over its lines west of Elgin.

The Great North had opened using a system of telegraphic train orders, and as the signalling was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens in a process that frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.

====Aberdeen to Inverness====
The Great North and Highland had agreed in 1865 that Keith would be the exchange point for traffic between the two railways, but in 1886 the Great North had two lines to Elgin that, although longer than the Highland&#x27;s direct line, served more populous areas. The coastal route between Keith and Elgin was long but had easier gradients than the via Craigellachie. The Highland&#x27;s main line south from Inverness was via Forres, the Great North believing that their competitors treated the line to Elgin as a branch. In 1883 a shorter route south from Inverness was promoted by an independent company, the bill defeated in parliament only after the Highland had promised to request authority for a shorter line. The following year, as well as the Highland&#x27;s more direct line from Aviemore, the Great North proposed a branch from its Speyside Section to Inverness. The Highland Railway route was chosen, but the Great North won a concession that goods and passengers that could be exchanged at any junction with through bookings and with services conveniently arranged.
In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10 am Aberdeen service to reach Keith at 11:50 am with through carriages that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1 pm. This connected with a Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed to connect with the Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.

In 1893 the Highland cancelled the traffic agreement and withdrew two connecting trains, complaining that they were unprofitable. One of the trains was reinstated after an appeal was made to the Railway &amp; Canal Commissioners and a frustrated Great North applied to parliament in 1895 for running powers to Inverness, but withdrew after it was agreed that the Railway &amp; Canal Commissioners would arbitrate in the matter. With no judgement by 1897, the Great North prepared to apply again for running powers over the Highland to Inverness, this time agreeing to double track the line, but the commissioners published their finding before the bill was submitted to parliament. Traffic was to be exchanged at both Elgin and Keith, the services exchanged at Elgin needed to include through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast routes, and the timetable had to be approved by the commissioners. The resulting Commissioners&#x27; Service started in 1897 with eight through services, four via the Highland to Keith taking between and 5 hours, and four with carriages exchanged at Elgin with portions that travelled via Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking hours. The 3 pm from Inverness to Aberdeen via Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes. Initially portions for the coast and Craigellachie divided at Huntly, but Cairnie Platform was opened at Grange Junction in summer 1898. The main line was double track to Huntly in 1896 and Keith in 1898, except for a single-track bridge over the Deveron between Avochie and Rothiemay, which was replaced by a double-track bridge in 1900.

====Subbies and hotels====
In 1880 an express was introduced on the Deeside Line, taking 90 minutes to travel from Aberdeen to Ballater; by 1886 this had reduced to 75 minutes. In 1887 the service between Aberdeen and Dyce had improved with more local trains and new stations; by the end of that year there were twelve trains a day, eventually becoming twenty trains a day calling at nine stops in twenty minutes. The trains were initially called the &quot;Jubilees&quot;, as it was Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, but became known as the &quot;Subbies&quot;. Suburban services were also introduced between Aberdeen and Culter on the Deeside Line in 1894, after the track had been doubled, starting with ten down and nine up trains calling at seven stops in twenty-two minutes. The number of trains was eventually doubled and an additional station provided.

In 1891 the company offices were moved from Waterloo to a new building in Guild Street with direct access to the station. The same year the Great North took over the Palace Hotel (closed after a fire in 1941), near the joint railway station in Aberdeen and modernised it, installing electric lighting and building a covered way between the hotel and station. Encouraged by its success, the company obtained permission in 1893 to build an hotel and golf course at Cruden Bay, about north of Aberdeen. The hotel was linked to the Great North by the Boddam Branch, a new single-track branch from Ellon, on the Buchan section, which served Cruden Bay and fishing town at Boddam. The line opened in 1897 with services from Ellon taking about forty minutes. The hotel opened in 1899, connected to the railway station by the Cruden Bay Hotel Tramway. This was nearly long, with a gauge of and operated by electric tramcars that took power from an overhead line. Seasonal through services to Aberdeen began in 1899 with an up service in the morning; for some years an afternoon up service returned in the evening. Excursions for tourists had operated on the Deeside Line from 1881, later joined by special services on the Strathspey Line and the Coast Line alongside the Moray Firth, promoted as the &quot;Scottish Riviera&quot;.

===Maturity, 1900–1914===
There was interest at the end of the 19th century in using the new &quot;Light Railways Act 1896&quot; to approve lines to serve rural areas. The long Aberdeenshire Light Railway was independently promoted in 1896 to serve Skene and Echt, with tracks laid along the public roads in Aberdeen. The Great North proposed an alternative Echt Light Railway and a line to Newburgh that would both use the Aberdeen tramway tracks in the city. In 1897 a line from Echt to Aberdeen was approved, but only as far the city outskirts after opposition to laying tracks in the public roads or using the tramways for goods traffic. The plans were changed to connect the line with the Great North at Kittybrewster, but the scheme abandoned after the costs had started to rise.

The Great North was granted a Light Railway Order on 8 September 1899 for a light railway from Fraserburgh to St Combs. The Order included a clause, unusual for the time, permitting the use of electric traction; but the company opted for steam traction, and the locomotives were fitted with cowcatchers as the line was unfenced. Services started on 1 July 1903, with six trains a day that took 17 minutes to complete the journey. A light railway was proposed to cover the from Fraserburgh to Rosehearty, but the scheme was abandoned after opposition to laying tracks on the public road.

Finding its locomotive works at Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction on a new works at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer the works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902.

The Great North rebuilt Elgin station in 1902 to replace a temporary wooden building dating from the 1860s, a joint structure with the adjacent station having been declined by the Highland Railway. Following negotiations, amalgamation of the Highland and the Great North of Scotland Railways was accepted by the Great North shareholders in early 1906, but the Highland board withdrew after opposition from a minority of its shareholders. The Aberdeen and Inverness trains were jointly worked after 1908 and locomotives were no longer exchanged at Keith or Elgin; between 1914 and 1916 the Highland paid the Great North to provide locomotives for all of the services through to Inverness.

In spring 1904 the Great North began a motor omnibus service to Braemar, connecting with trains at Ballater. These early buses had solid tyres and a legal speed limit of , but were faster than the horse-drawn coaches they replaced. By 1907 buses connected with Great North train services and conveyed passengers to Strathdon, Midmar, Echt, Cluny Castle and Aberchirder, between Cock Bridge and Tomintoul a horse-drawn coach was used as the motor buses could not ascend the steep road. Services from Aberdeen connected with trains at , where a refreshment room was built. In 1914 the railway had 35 passenger road vehicles that, together with 15 five-ton lorries, worked daily.

Aberdeen joint station was congested, resulting in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime due to the large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms on the western side opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.

===War and grouping, 1914–1922===
With Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on the German Empire on 4 August 1914, the government took control of the railways under the &quot;Regulation of the Forces Act 1871&quot;. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Great North of Scotland&#x27;s main role was providing a relief route when the Highland Railway route south to Perth was congested, on one Sunday conveying twenty-one troop specials from Keith to Aberdeen. Timber from the forests of the north of Scotland were carried from sidings at Kemnay, Knockando and Nethy Bridge. A total of 609 staff left to serve in the war, and a memorial to the 93 who died in action was erected at the offices in Aberdeen. Services were maintained until 1916, when staff shortages reduced services, although no lines were closed.
The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an eight-hour day and increased price of coal. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by parliament as the &quot;Railways Act 1921&quot;. At the start of the 20th century the company&#x27;s shares had been restructured; the final dividends were 3 per cent on preferred stock, unaltered from previously, and per cent on ordinary stock, slightly above average. Before grouping the Great North of Scotland Railway operated of track.

===London and North Eastern Railway===
On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became an isolated part of the Scottish division of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), the Caledonian to the south and Highland to the west both becoming part of a different group, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. That summer a sleeping carriage operated between Lossiemouth and , and a through carriage ran from to Cruden Bay on Fridays. Sunday services were re-introduced; from 1928 Aberdeen suburban services ran hourly during the afternoon and evenings. Afterwards the economic situation deteriorated and the railway companies advised the trade unions in 1928 that wages would need to be cut; this was implemented in August 1930 after the Wall Street crash the previous year. Economy measures were introduced and unprofitable passenger services withdrawn, the Oldmeldrum branch closing on 2 November 1931 and the branch to Cruden Bay and Boddam on 31 October 1932. Road transport was arranged for guests at the Cruden Bay hotel, from Ellon for the first summer season, and then from Aberdeen.

Carriages were transferred in to replace the older four-wheelers, former North Eastern Railway vehicles in 1924–25 and fifty former Great Eastern Railway six-wheelers between 1926 and 1929 for the Aberdeen suburban services. By 1936 more up to date Gresley bogie carriages were used on the primary trains. Optimism returned and traffic increased after 1933, and a luxury rail land cruise, the &quot;Northern Belle&quot;, ran over former Great North lines. However, the Aberdeen subbies had been losing money for some time as a result of competition from the local buses, and from 5 April 1937 the local services between Aberdeen, Dyce and Culter were withdrawn and most of the intermediate stations closed.

The railways were again placed under government control on 1 September 1939, and Britain was at war two days later. The Cruden Bay Hotel was used as an army hospital and the tramway ceased operating in 1941. Handed back to the railway in 1945, it never reopened. The Palace Hotel burnt down in 1941. The Station Hotel was used as an admiralty administrative centre, and reopened in 1950 after refurbishment.

===British Railways===
Britain&#x27;s railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines were placed under the control of the Scottish Region of British Railways. To reduce costs the Alford branch was closed to passengers on 2 January 1950, followed by the Macduff Branch on 1 October 1951.
The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known formally as the &quot;Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways&quot;, was published in December 1954, and with the aim of increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. In 1958 a battery-electric railcar was introduced on the Deeside Line and a diesel railbus on the Speyside Section. Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) took over services to Peterhead and Fraserburgh in 1959 and from 1960 cross-country types were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed hours for four stops. By 1961 the only service still using steam locomotives was the branch from Tillynaught to Banff.

In 1963 Dr Beeching published his report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, which recommended closing the network&#x27;s least used stations and lines. Only the Aberdeen to Keith main line survived, albeit without its stopping services and the remaining former Great North lines closed to passengers. The Lossiemouth and Banff branch closed in 1964 and the following year the St Combs branch, line from Dyce to Peterhead and Fraserburgh and the Speyside section closed and local services to Inverurie were withdrawn. Attempts to save the Deeside section to Banchory failed and it closed in 1966. On 6 May 1968 services were withdrawn on the Coast Line, the former Great North line via Craigellachie and the local services between Aberdeen and Elgin. The Beeching Report had recommended Inverurie and Insch stations for closure, but these were saved by the subsequent inquiry.

The goods service at individual stations was also withdrawn after Beeching&#x27;s report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 the line between Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 &quot;Super Sprinter&quot; and then Class 158 &quot;Express&quot; and Class 170 units.

===Legacy===

The Aberdeen to Inverness Line currently uses the former Great North of Scotland Railway line as far Keith with stations at Dyce, Inverurie, Insch, Huntly and Keith. Eleven trains a day run between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking about hours, supplemented between Aberdeen and Inverurie by approximately the same number of local trains. In a project scheduled for completion in 2030, the line is to be improved to allow a regular hourly Aberdeen to Inverness service, additional commuter trains into Inverness and Aberdeen and new stations at Kintore and Dalcross, near Inverness airport.

Heritage and tourist railways also use the former Great North of Scotland Railway alignment. The Keith and Dufftown Railway runs seasonal services over the between Keith Town and Dufftown using Class 108 diesel multiple units. The Strathspey Railway operates seasonal services over the former Highland Railway route from to Grantown-on-Spey via the joint Highland and Great North Boat of Garten station. The Royal Deeside Railway operates over of former Deeside Railway at Milton of Crathes near Banchory during summer weekends and in December, and based at Alford railway station is the Alford Valley Railway, which seasonally operates a narrow gauge railway.

Former alignments have been opened as long distance rail trails for pedestrians, cyclists and horses. The Formartine and Buchan Way runs from Dyce to Maud before dividing to follow the two branches to Peterhead and Fraserburgh. The Deeside Way is open between Aberdeen and Kincardine O&#x27;Neil and Aboyne and Ballater.

Nestrans (The North East of Scotland Transport Partnership), the organization responsible for local transport strategy, consider that building new railways along these routes would not be beneficial at the moment but the alignments are protected from development. The Speyside Way, one of Scotland&#x27;s Long Distance Routes, mostly follows the route of the Speyside section between Craigellachie and Ballindalloch and Grantown and Nethy Bridge.

===Locomotives===
====Early locomotives====

The first locomotives were 2-4-0 tender engines, built by Wm Fairbairn in Manchester to the design of the locomotive superintendent Daniel Kinnear Clark. Twelve were ordered for the opening of the first line, seven passenger and five goods. They were all fitted with Clark&#x27;s patent smoke preventing system that improved fuel economy and painted green with black borders, and red buffer beams. There was no protection for the driver or fireman and braking was by wooden blocks on the four wheels of the tender. The railway opened with only five locomotives, and within days one had been seriously damaged in the collision at and a second had a mechanical fault. Two more locomotives had arrived by the end of 1854, and the order was complete by summer 1855. Four more passenger locomotives were ordered in 1857, weatherboards and sanding equipment had been fitted by 1860, and cabs added in the 1880s. John Folds Ruthven replaced Clark in 1855 and an order was placed with Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. for two 0-4-0 tank engines to bank trains on the line to Waterloo near Aberdeen harbour. After William Cowan became locomotive superintendent nine more locomotives arrived in 1859–61. These were followed by nine 4-4-0s, also built by R. Stephenson &amp; Co., and delivered between 1862 and 1864. Six more powerful 4-4-0 locomotives arrived from Neilsons in 1866, and were fitted with a more modern bogie. Three passed to the London and North Eastern Railway after the 1923 Grouping, and No. 45 hauled a train at the Railway Centenary celebrations in 1925 before being scrapped.

In 1863 the Great North took over the operation of the Banffshire and Morayshire Railways and absorbed their locomotives. The Banffshire had four locomotives, two 0-4-2 tanks, named &quot;Banff&quot; and &quot;Portsoy&quot;, built by Hawthorns of Leith for the line&#x27;s opening in 1859. The other two locomotives were 0-4-2 tender engines, one bought secondhand from the Scottish Central Railway, having been built in 1848 by the Vulcan Foundry in Warrington and named &quot;Keith&quot;, and a similar tender engine built by Hawthorns. The Morayshire Railway had started services in 1852 with two 2-2-0 engines designed by James Samuel and built by Neilsons. The locomotives had proved inadequate and were replaced by two larger 2-4-0 tank engines. The Great North took over the operation of the Deeside Railway in 1866. Its first two locomotives were 0-4-2 tank engines, built by Hawthorns and arrived in 1854. No. 3, a tender locomotive, was delivered in 1854 from Dodds &amp; Son of Rotherham, but this had mechanical defects and was never satisfactory. Between 1857 and 1866 four 0-4-2 tender locomotives arrived from Hawthorns; these were similar to the Banffshire&#x27;s Nos. 3 and 4; the Deeside also bought the Banffshire&#x27;s No. 4 in 1864. One of these locomotives was given a large six-wheeled tender to allow it to haul the Royal Trains from Aberdeen to without stopping. The tender locomotives were found to be unstable at high speeds were all withdrawn by 1880.
The company&#x27;s financial difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives were built in 1876 by Neilson&#x27;s, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and were the first to be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson &amp; Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson &amp; Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson&#x27;s later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.

====Class S and later====

In 1890 Manson was replaced as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, the son of Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark&#x27;s smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so they were the same as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.
William Pickersgill replaced Johnson in 1894, and between 1895 and 1898 twenty-six new locomotives were purchased from Neilsons. Similar to Johnson&#x27;s Class S, they were recorded at speeds of and running the from to in 23 minutes 46 seconds. A further order for ten was placed in 1899, but train mileage had been reduced and five were sold to the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway. Pickersgill saw the works move from Kittybrewster to Inverurie before Thomas Heywood took over in 1914, three months before the outbreak of war. The railway took over the working of the Aberdeen harbour railway and in 1915 purchased four 0-4-2 tank locomotives from Manning Wardle. After the war, six more locomotives were built in 1920 by the North British Locomotive Company, and two locomotives the following year at Inverurie. Similar to the 1899 locomotives but with Robinson superheaters, these were given names. Heywood changed the livery during the war, and the traditional green being replaced by black lined with yellow and red.

On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland became a part of the Scottish division of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, &quot;Gordon Highlander&quot; was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood&#x27;s lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo&#x27;ness.

===Carriages===

The first carriages were four-wheelers, long. Painted a dark brown with yellow lining and lettering, they had Newall&#x27;s chain brake and a seat for the guard on the roof. Two classes of accommodation were provided: the first class carriages were divided into three compartments each with six upholstered seats and lit by two oil lamps hung between the partitions. Third class passengers were seated on wooden benches in a carriage seating 40 passengers sharing one oil lamp. The Great North never owned any second class carriages. Built by Brown, Marshall &amp; Co, only half the number of carriages ordered had arrived for the start of public services in 1854. Later the guard&#x27;s seat was removed and longer vehicles with six wheels were built. Accommodation for third class passengers was improved in the 1880s and the seats were upholstered.

The Westinghouse air brake was trialled on carriages in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the Highland Railway used vacuum brakes, carriages used on the Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone&#x27;s system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, long and weighing were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a clerestory roof. This was long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant&#x27;s coupe, which was fitted with a cooking stove. Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted in the early years of the twentieth century. No. 34, a 6-wheel carriage built in the 1890s is preserved at the Embsay &amp; Bolton Abbey Steam Railway as part of the Stately Trains collection.

In 1905 the Great North introduced two articulated steam railcars. The locomotive unit was mounted on four wheels, one pair driven and with the Cochran patent boiler that was common on stationary engines, but an unusual design for a locomotive. The saloon carriage accommodated 46 third class passengers on reversible lath-and-space seats and a position for the driver with controls using cables over the carriage roof. The cars were introduced on the Lossiemouth branch and the St Combs Light Railway, but when in motion there was considerable vibration that was uncomfortable for the passengers and caused problems for the steam engine. Before they were withdrawn in 1909–10, one was tried on Deeside suburban services, but had insufficient accommodation and was unable to maintain the schedule.

==Constituent railways==
The Great North of Scotland Railway absorbed the following railways in 1866:

*Aberdeen and Turriff Railway had been the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway prior to 1859. The Great North supported the railway, operated the services from opening and was guarantor from 1862.
*Banff, Macduff and Turriff Extension Railway extended the Aberdeen and Turriff from Turriff. Services were extended by the Great North over the new line from opening.
*Most of the Alford Valley Railway&#x27;s directors also served on the board of the Great North, which operated services from opening and was guarantor from 1862.
*Formartine and Buchan Railway was worked by the Great North from opening in 1861, with services from Aberdeen. The Great North was guarantor from 1863.
*Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway opened in 1856, the line was leased to the Great North from 1858.
*Keith and Dufftown Railway was worked as an extension of the main line, services operated by the Great North from opening in 1862.
*Strathspey Railway was sponsored by the Great North, which operated services from opening.

These companies operated by the Great North in 1866 were merged later:
*Banffshire Railway had been Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway when it opened in 1859, the Great North taking over the operation of services from 1863 and the company renamed. Amalgamation was authorised in an 1867 Act.
*Deeside Railway leased from 1 September 1866, merged 1 August 1875.
*Aboyne &amp; Braemar Railway was the extension of the Deeside to Ballater, and was operated by the Great North from its opening on 17 October 1866. Merged 31 January 1876.
*Morayshire Railway was opened in 1852, worked by the Great North from 1863 when the extension to Craigellachie opened. The 1866 Act provided for the merging of the two companies when terms where agreed, and the companies were merged in 1880.

<doc id="1145148" wikidata="Q182093" url="?curid=1145148" title="McDonnell Douglas MD-12">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas MD-12 was a large wide-body airliner concept planned by the McDonnell Douglas company in the 1990s. It was first conceived as a trijet larger than the MD-11, then stretched to a quadjet airliner. It was to be similar in size to the Boeing 747, but with greater passenger capacity through two full-length passenger decks. However, the MD-12 received no orders and was canceled. McDonnell Douglas then studied larger MD-11 derivatives named &quot;MD-XX&quot; without proceeding.

==Design and development==
===Background===
McDonnell Douglas studied improved, stretched versions of the MD-11 trijet, named MD-12X with a possible lower-front passenger deck with panoramic windows. The MDC board of directors agreed in October 1991 to offer the MD-12X design to airlines. The MD-12X had a length of and a wingspan of . In November 1991, McDonnell Douglas and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding to form a company to produce the new design. The new company would have McDonnell Douglas as the majority shareholder (51%) with Taiwan Aerospace (40%) and other Asian companies (9%) having the remaining shares.

===MD-12=== 

In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas made a move to separate its civil and military divisions in a bid to raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X trijet. Separating the costly development of the military C-17 airlifter, which had been a drain on the company&#x27;s resources, from the profit-making production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X.

The design grew into the much larger MD-12 with four engines and two passenger decks extending the length of the fuselage. The length of the main MD-12 variants was with a wingspan of . The fuselage was wide by high.

McDonnell Douglas unveiled its MD-12 design in April 1992. The design was similar in concept to the Airbus A3XX and Boeing New Large Airplane, and it would have been larger than the Boeing 747 with which it would have directly competed. Douglas Aircraft also studied a smaller double-decker design in the 1960s for the aircraft that would eventually become the DC-10.

The first flight of the MD-12 was to take place in late 1995, with delivery in 1997. Despite aggressive marketing and initial excitement, especially in the aviation press, no orders were placed for the aircraft. MDC lacked the resources after Taiwan Aerospace left the project. Some skeptics believed that MDC launched the project to lure Boeing into paying a higher price for the company. A new double-deck widebody has proved to be extremely expensive and complex to develop, even for the remaining aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus, although the massive Airbus A380, a similar concept to the MD-12, was later brought to fruition, but was not a financial success.

===MD-XX===
With the MD-12 program over, McDonnell Douglas focused on 300 to 400–seat MD-11 derivatives. At the 1996 Farnborough International Air Show, the company presented plans for a new trijet with high-seating and long-range named &quot;MD-XX&quot;. The MD-XX was offered in two variants; MD-XX Stretch with a longer fuselage and MD-XX LR for longer range. Both MD-XX variant designs had wingspan, the same as MD-12. The MD-XX Stretch was lengthened over the MD-11 and had seating for 375 in a typical 3-class arrangement and 515 in all-economy seating. Its range was to be . The MD-XX LR was the same length as the MD-11, had seating for 309 in a typical 3-class arrangement and featured a range of . However, the MDC board of directors decided to end the MD-XX program in October 1996, stating the financial investment for the program was too large for the company.

==Variants==
The MD-12 was offered in a few proposed variants as listed below.

*MD-12 HC (High Capacity)
*MD-12 LR (Long Range)
*MD-12 ST (Stretch)
*MD-12 Twin (two-engine version)

<text>National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute) () is a public technical university in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1942 as the Moscow Mechanical Institute of Munitions, but was soon renamed the Moscow Mechanical Institute. Its original mission was to train skilled personnel for the Soviet military and Soviet atomic bomb project. It was renamed the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute in 1953, which was its name until 2009.

By the Order of the Government of Russia on April 8, 2009 (#480-r) on behalf of Russian President&#x27;s Decree of October 7, 2008 (#1448) &quot;On the pilot project launching on creating National Research Universities&quot; MEPhI was granted this new status. The university was reorganized. The aim of the university existence is now preparing the specialists by giving them higher professional, post-graduation professional, secondary professional and additional professional education, as well as educational and scientific activities.

In 2022, QS World University rankings rated the university #308 in the world, World University Rankings by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked the university #401 in the world, and in 2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rated the university #483 in the world.

==Academics==
Today, MEPhI has nine main departments (faculties or institutes):

* Institute of Nuclear Physics and Engineering
* Institute for Laser and Plasma Technologies
* Institute of Engineering Physics for Biomedicine
* Institute of Nanoengineering in Electronics, Spintronics and Photonics
* Institute of Cyber Intelligence Systems
* Institute of Financial and Economic Security
* Institute of International Relations
* Faculty of Physics and Technology
* Faculty of Business Informatics and Complex Systems Management

The university offers bachelor, masters (and similar degree &#x27;Specialist&#x27;), and post-graduate degrees in physics, mathematics, computer science and other areas. MEPhI facilities include a 2.5 MW (thermal) pool-type research reactor and Neutrino Water Detector NEVOD. The university has about 35,000 students at branches in Moscow and other towns. In Moscow are around 7,500 students (including over 1300 foreigners). It normally takes 4 – 5.5 (some sub-departments take six) years for a student to graduate from MEPhI. The curriculum of the first two years consists exclusively of required courses (core), with emphasis on mathematics, physics, experimental work and English. After the two first years of studying students on a competition basis enroll in the sub-departments which specialize in different branches of physics, computer science, information security, mathematics, etc.
== Rankings ==

In 2022, QS World University rankings rated the university #308 in the world, World University Rankings by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked the university #401 in the world, and in 2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rated the university #483 in the world.

==Student population==

The student population is predominantly male. During the first years from MEPhI&#x27;s foundation there was a ban against accepting women. In recent years this situation has changed.

==Location==

It is a 15-minute walk (or a five-minute bus ride) from the university to the Kashirskaya station on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line of the Moscow Metro.

== Online resources ==
During 2016–18 MEPhI increased its presence in online educational platforms, namely Coursera, edX, Universarium and CLP4NET. By the end of 2018, MEPhI had provided 43 courses via those platforms, including 25 on Coursera and 11 on edX. In 2018, the number of students that joined MEPhI&#x27;s online courses on the online platforms reached approximately 160,000 persons from 150 countries.

<text>Moral Maze is a live discussion programme on BBC Radio 4, broadcast since 1990. Since November 2011, it has also been available as a podcast.

==Structure==
Four regular panellists discuss moral and ethical issues raised by a recent news story. Michael Buerk delivers a preamble launching the topic, then a series of &#x27;witnesses&#x27; – experts or other relevant people – are questioned by the panellists, who then discuss what each witness said.

==Panellists==
The regular panellists are:
* Nazir Afzal
* Andrew Doyle
* Giles Fraser
* Nesrine Malik
* Anne McElvoy
* Melanie Phillips
* Ash Sarkar
* Mona Siddiqui
* Tim Stanley
* Matthew Taylor
* Inaya Folarin Iman

Notable former panellists include Rabbi Hugo Gryn (who died in 1996), Janet Daley, Edward Pearce, Geoffrey Robertson, Michael Mansfield, politician Michael Gove, Claire Fox, Michael Portillo, Ian Hargreaves, Kenan Malik, scientist Steven Rose, philosophers Simon Blackburn, Roger Scruton, and Galen Strawson; and, historian David Starkey, who often attracted controversy for his blunt manner.

==History==
The first programme on Monday 20 August 1990, was forty minutes long from 11am, and followed by &quot;Poetry Please&quot;. It was made by the Factual Unit of Religious Programmes (later called Factual Programmes Religion) at BBC North in Manchester. It was hoped that the programme format would involve the panellists&#x27; views being revised during the course of a programme, but this rarely happened.

In April 1991, it had moved to Tuesdays, and followed the 9am news, until 9:45am (a slot similar to the current &quot;In Our Time&quot;). In July 1991, it had moved to 8:05pm until 8:50pm on Fridays, replacing &quot;Any Questions?&quot; for the summer recess. There was then a repeat at 1pm on the following Saturday, and a phone-in from 2 to 2:30pm, replacing &quot;Any Answers?&quot;. There was also an end-of-year programme. In July 1992, it had moved to Thursday mornings following the 9am news. It became a &quot;de rigueur&quot; listen for Westminster MPs. By 1997, it was fifty-five minutes long, lasting until 10am. It moved to Wednesday evenings from 13 May 1998, in the 1998 schedule changes, with a repeat of the forty-five-minute programme on Saturday night at 10:15pm.

Michael Buerk has presented the programme since August 1990. David Aaronovitch has presented occasional episodes during Buerk&#x27;s absence. More recently Edward Stourton and William Crawley have deputised.

Originally produced at the BBC North West&#x27;s New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester, the programme production base is Salford Quays. The programme is broadcast live from BBC Broadcasting House in London.

===TV pilot===
In early 1994, a television version was considered, which eventually took off on Saturday 10 September 1994, on BBC2 as a trial series of six 45-minute-long programmes broadcast around midnight, perhaps influenced by Channel 4&#x27;s successful late-night discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;. The pilot had audiences of around 1.3 million. It was last broadcast on 15 October 1994, at 11pm.

==Criticism==
In his book &quot;Bad Thoughts&quot; (US title &quot;Crimes Against Logic&quot;), libertarian philosopher Jamie Whyte, who has been a witness on the programme, advises readers to listen to &quot;The Moral Maze&quot; for innumerable examples of faulty reasoning. Journalist and author Nick Cohen has also criticised the programme, in a piece highlighting the media careers of Trotskyite-turned-libertarian former cadres of the Revolutionary Communist Party, centred on &quot;Spiked&quot; magazine.

On 2 April 2021, Scottish broadcaster Lesley Riddoch criticised the programme, for taking an approach where observers and experts would discuss a particular problem, without the actual participants being part of the discussion. Riddoch also stated that the programme was too selective, elitist and abstract.

<doc id="1145173" wikidata="Q221196" url="?curid=1145173" title="Gaara">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Originally debuting as an antagonist, Gaara is a shinobi affiliated with Sunagakure and is the son of Sunagakure&#x27;s leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born as a demon&#x27;s host as part of his father&#x27;s intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. Only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki does Gaara earn a change of perspective, as he eventually becomes Sunagakure&#x27;s and gains acceptance by his people. Gaara has appeared in several pieces of &quot;Naruto&quot; media, including two of the featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and several video games.

Gaara was created a foil to the series&#x27; eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, as the two were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent major changes in the making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O&#x27;Brien voices him in the English dub.

Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Gaara&#x27;s character. Multiple series called Naruto&#x27;s fight against Gaara the high point of the entire series due to their similarities and Gaara&#x27;s role in the aftermath as he attempts to redeem himself. Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara&#x27;s likeness, including plush dolls, key chains, and action figures.

==Creation and conception==

&quot;Naruto&quot; author Masashi Kishimoto created Gaara as a foil to the series&#x27; protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto and he have a similar background: he was rejected by his peers and fellow villagers for being the host of One-Tailed beast, Shukaku, a situation that Kishimoto describes as &quot;very much like Naruto&#x27;s&quot;. Gaara&#x27;s development from this state into a highly withdrawn, sadistic character was intended to induce sympathy for him from readers, as it was contrasted against Naruto&#x27;s development into a cheerful troublemaker. Additionally, his design was designed to look like the Tanuki since Kishimoto thought that it would make him a good rival for Naruto&#x27;s Nine-Tailed Demon Fox since several parts from the Shukaku were considered by Kishimoto to be opposite ones from the Demon Fox.

Gaara&#x27;s backstory became one of Kishimoto&#x27;s favorite stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara&#x27;s mental state. The character was originally going to be called Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto&#x27;s editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named &quot;Kumomaru&quot; but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto&#x27;s foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for &quot;love&quot; in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara&#x27;s name can be read as &quot;love&quot;).

Gaara&#x27;s initial attire, along with the costumes of his siblings, was difficult for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave the three of them simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites &quot;The Matrix&quot;, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara&#x27;s new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara&#x27;s body. This shot was inspired by &quot;Akira&quot;, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.

In the Japanese version of &quot;Naruto&quot;″s animated versions Akira Ishida voices Gaara. Liam O&#x27;Brien takes his place for the English dub. The Western actor, before being selected to voice Gaara, had already heard about the series&#x27; popularity. O&#x27;Brien went for an early audition in Los Angeles with hopes of doing Gaara&#x27;s voice but failed it. However, O&#x27;Brien later went through another audition and got Gaara&#x27;s role.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Naruto&quot;===
Before he was born, Gaara&#x27;s father, the 4th Kazekage Rasa, had Chiyo make Gaara into the Jinchuriki for the tailed beast while he was still in his mother&#x27;s womb before she died giving birth to him. Though believed at the time to be Shukaku&#x27;s power in action, Gaara can manipulate sand, which subconsciously protects him. Rasa intended to use Gaara as the village&#x27;s personal weapon, but Shukaku&#x27;s bloodlust proved too much for Gaara as he suffered night terrors brought about by the tailed beast&#x27;s influence. With Gaara&#x27;s sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated. Gaara had the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, after Yashamaru, the only person who he thought loved him, tried to kill him, on the order of his father; he felt he had to kill others to confirm the value of his own existence. He thus became narcissistic, even permanently scarring his left temple with the kanji for for his new drive.

Gaara first appears in the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, to take part in the Chunin Exams alongside his older siblings Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara&#x27;s defenses, who, enraged, breaks Lee&#x27;s arm and leg, claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha gives Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him, with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help prevent Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which had become an enemy of Sunagakure once it was revealed that Orochimaru had murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he helps Lee fight Orochimaru&#x27;s servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from leaving Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara&#x27;s fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.

In Part II of the series, three years after his mission, Deidara, a member of the criminal organization Akatsuki, is sent to Sunagakure to capture Gaara. Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body. Gaara dies in the process but an elder from the village named Chiyo sacrifices her own life to revive him. Sometime later, he attends the Five Kage Summit, and the Akatsuki&#x27;s leader, Tobi, breaks into the meeting and announces the Fourth Great Ninja War, to capture the last two Tailed-Beasts. Gaara later joins the new Shinobi Alliance as its field commander to protect Naruto and Killer Bee, using Naruto&#x27;s philosophy of love against the Akatsuki&#x27;s philosophy of hatred to unite the army, which had nearly imploded from internal strife. On the second day of the war, Gaara encounters his reanimated father. Rasa reveals the truth to Gaara: that Yashamaru&#x27;s final action was his doing, and that Gaara&#x27;s mother always loved him, and Gaara is moved to tears after learning his mother&#x27;s will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated. Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage, and joins the other Kage to fight Madara Uchiha, who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result. Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara moves to assist in the battle against the Ten-Tails. Before Shukaku is absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara makes his peace with the tailed beast, thanking it for ensuring that he would meet Naruto. Gaara helps rescue Naruto and briefly holds off Madara before Naruto is successfully revived. Once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is activated, Gaara is caught in the illusion before being freed by Naruto and Sasuke. By the series epilogue, having the Hidden Leaf Village&#x27;s Nara Clan as in-laws through Temari, Gaara remains active as the Kazekage.

===In other media===
Gaara has made several appearances outside of the &quot;Naruto&quot; anime and manga. He is present in the second and sixth &quot;Naruto&quot; feature films, &quot;Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel&quot; and &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire&quot;. In the former, he protects the Land of Wind from an assault by Haido, the antagonist of the film, and later battles the lightning user Ranke, one of Haido&#x27;s subordinates, and defeats her, while in the latter, he temporarily becomes enemies of Konohagakure as they are the prime suspect of a pitfall attack on him while he is about to attend a meeting with Tsunade, in reality being done by a missing nin, Hiruko, and briefly battles Naruto, although after the confusion is cleared, he allies himself with them again. Gaara is also present in the third original video animation released in the series, in which he participates in a tournament of various characters from across the series. In &quot;&quot;, Gaara has adopted a child named Shinki. Gaara and the other Kage attend the Chunin exam in Konoha before they engage in combat against Momoshiki and Kinshiki in a rescue mission led by Sasuke after Naruto was kidnapped. This role is retitled in the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga sequel, &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Naruto&quot; video games commonly feature Gaara, including the and . In some games, he uses his Shukaku form for combat, as well as other moves not seen in the anime or manga. &quot;&quot; marks the first appearance of Gaara in his Part II appearance in a video game.

Gaara also appears in light novels from the series. He makes a cameo in &quot;Kakashi&#x27;s Story&quot; alongside the other Kage. In &quot;Shikamaru Hiden&quot; he joins his sister Temari and Naruto in the search for the missing Shikamaru Nara whom Gaara values due to his close relationship with Temari. In &quot;Sakura&#x27;s Hiden&quot;, Gaara assists the Konohagakure ninja upon their news that a man resembling Sasuke Uchiha is planning to attack the village. In &quot;Konoha Hiden&quot;, Gaara visits Konohagakure to see the wedding of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga. He also appears as the protagonist of &quot;Gaara Hiden&quot; which follows his works as the Fifth Kazekage while dealing with his sister&#x27;s wedding with Shikamaru.

==Reception==

Gaara has ranked highly in the popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top ten. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Gaara was in 4th place. Several pieces of Gaara merchandise have been released; including key chains, plush dolls and action figures of his Part I and Part II appearance. AnimeCentral listed him as eighth best villain in anime with comments focused on how flashbacks made him a tragic character and at the same time similar to Naruto Uzumaki. Additionally, his fight against Rock Lee was listed as the second best one in anime for exchanges in moves and its conclusion. In 2014, IGN listed him as the third best &quot;Naruto&quot; character when the series ended. &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; author Kōhei Horikoshi regarded Gaara as his favorite &quot;Naruto&quot; character in the Chuunin Exams for his portrayal as the author claimed that most high school students enjoyed his strength.

Anime and manga publications have mostly praised Gaara&#x27;s character. IGN noted that Gaara was an &quot;anti-Naruto&quot;, possessing a &quot;dark, solemn character&quot; as opposed to Naruto&#x27;s continuous cheer and excitement. In another review, IGN also called Gaara&#x27;s background &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;a tad creepy&quot; due to the disparity between the development of Naruto&#x27;s and Gaara&#x27;s personalities. Anime News Network celebrated the &quot;depth and emotion&quot; that Naruto&#x27;s and Gaara&#x27;s similarities added to the plot, and commented that &quot;nowhere in the entire series run does &quot;Naruto&quot; shine brighter than in the peak period of his battle against Gaara&quot;. They also complimented Kishimoto&#x27;s visual presentation of Gaara in the manga, referring to &quot;chilling [glimpses] of Gaara&#x27;s crazed, exposed face&quot;. Mania Entertainment noted that Gaara and Sasuke&#x27;s first fight shows how the former has a &quot;fragile&quot; psyche despite his violent attitude. His backstory was also praised by Mania Entertainment since it includes &quot;a ton of legitimate emotion&quot; allowing viewers from the series to understand more Gaara&#x27;s personality. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. enjoyed the similarities between Gaara and Naruto as well as the former&#x27;s state after being defeated by the latter. His return to aid the Konohagakure ninjas to fight has been praised by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime who was mostly focused on Gaara&#x27;s change of hearts. Liam O&#x27;Brien, Gaara&#x27;s voice actor in the English dubbed version of the anime, has been praised. IGN noted that he did an &quot;excellent job&quot; of making Gaara sound terrifying to the viewer, and Anime News Network noted him as one of the best voice actors in the series. Akira Ishida was also noted to be one of the most famous actors from &quot;Naruto&quot; due to his experience in the 1990s before the anime&#x27;s release as well as the several characterizations he gave to Gaara.

Gaara&#x27;s promotion to leader from Sunagakure in Part II of the series was deemed as the most surprising development in the series by Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment. UK Anime Network&#x27;s Kevin Leathers stated that while in the first part of the series, Gaara was a fearsome villain, in the following one he became &quot;much more three-dimensional.&quot; Similarly, Douglass Jr. praised Gaara&#x27;s development in later episodes from &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; owing to his relationship&#x27;s expansion with Naruto. His fight against Deidara has also received positive response, with critics praising the revisit of Gaara&#x27;s popular moves and the strategy both fighters employed. On the other hand, Jason Thompson from Anime News Network noted that, while Gaara had developed ever since his introduction in Part I, it felt wrong that Gaara was accepted as the new Kazekage due to his previous wishes to kill people. During the last episodes of Part II&#x27;s adaptation, Amy McNulty, also from Anime News Network, enjoyed how Gaara was handled as a comic relief alongside other recurring character. Nevertheless, she found important how Gaara now thought of Naruto as a friend rather than as a hero in contrast to the early story arcs of Part II.

CDB debt is owned by local banks and treated as a risk-free asset under the proposed People&#x27;s Republic of China capital adequacy rules (i.e. the same treatment as PRC government bonds).

== History ==

The China Development Bank (CDB) was established in 1994 to provide development-oriented financing for high-priority government projects, particularly major infrastructure and projects that raise quality of life. It is under the direct jurisdiction of the State Council and the People&#x27;s Central Government. At present, it has 35 branches across the country and one representative office. 

The main objective as a state financial institution is to support the macroeconomic policies of the central government and to support national economic development and strategic structural changes in the economy. The bank provides financing for national projects such as infrastructure development, basic industries, energy, and transportation. Most of CDB&#x27;s loans are for domestic projects, and it began lending for projects abroad in the early 2000s.

From 1994 to 1998, CDB&#x27;s fundraising was subject to a higher degree of state control than in later periods. In the 1990s, CDB facilitated the creation of China&#x27;s interbank bond market. Initially, the People&#x27;s Bank of China (PBOC) required domestic financial institutions such as commercial banks to buy policy bank bonds. At this stage, the PBOC usually set high yields and did not permit the apportioned bonds to be sold on the secondary market. In February 1996, CDB began its first overseas bond issuance in Japan, followed a year later by an issuance in the United States. Overseas issuance helped CDB diversify its funding sources. Ultimately, the issuance of bonds allowed CDB to become a financially independent bank without the state&#x27;s tax revenues.

In April 1998, former PBOC deputy governor Chen Yuan, the eldest son of Chen Yun, was appointed CDB&#x27;s governor. Chen implemented reforms designed to increase CDB&#x27;s autonomy by reducing state involvement in CDB&#x27;s fundraising and lending.

From 1998 to 2008, CDB increased its fundraising autonomy and used an auction-based bond issuance mechanism to raise its funds. In 1999, CDB offered China&#x27;s first floating rate bond.

CDB plays a major role in alleviating infrastructure and energy bottlenecks in the Chinese economy. In 2003, CDB made loan arrangements for, or evaluated and underwrote, a total of 460 national debt projects and issued 246.8 billion yuan in loans. This accounted for 41% of its total investment. CDB&#x27;s loans to the &quot;bottleneck&quot; investments that the government prioritizes amounted to 91% of its total loan count. It also issued a total of 357.5 billion yuan in loans to western areas and more than 174.2 billion yuan to old industrial bases in Northeast China. These loans substantially increased the economic growth and structural readjustments of the Chinese economy.

In 2005 and 2006, CDB successfully issued two pilot Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) products in the domestic China market. Along with other ABS products issued by China Construction Bank, CDB has created a foundation for a promising debt capital and structured finance market.

China and Venezuela established the China-Venezuela Joint Fund in 2007, with the goal of offering capital funding for infrastructure projects in Venezuela which can be performed by Chinese companies. CDB lent $4 billion to the fund and the Venezuelan Economic and Social Development Bank (BANDES) contributed $2 billion.

As part of China&#x27;s response to the 2008 global financial crisis, emphasis on CDB&#x27;s policy aspects increased and the state formalized its credit guarantee for CDB. CDB was one of the financial agencies implementing China&#x27;s stimulus plan and vastly increased its lending for infrastructure and industrial projects.

From 2009 to 2019, CDB has issued 1.6 trillion yuan in loans to more than 4,000 projects involving infrastructure, communications, transportation, and basic industries. The investments are spread along the Yellow River, and both south and north of the Yangtze River. CDB has been increasingly focusing on developing the western and northwestern provinces in China. This could help reduce the growing economic disparity in the western provinces, and it has the potential to revitalize the old industrial bases of northeast China.

In 2010, CDB provided $30 billion in financing to Chinese solar power manufacturers.

At the end of 2010, CDB held US$687.8 billion in loans, more than twice the amount of the World Bank.

After Chen left the governorship of CDB in 2013, the bank&#x27;s institutional power decreased. 

The next CDB governor, Hu Huaibang, removed CDB personnel to staff the bank with personnel loyal to himself. Hu then leveraged his personal influence to approve large amounts of industrial loans which ultimately failed. Hu was removed from office in 2018 on suspicion of corruption and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2021 for accepting bribes to approve projects that should not have passed CDB criteria. Following these events, CDB became significantly more cautious in its financing decisions.

CDB is among the state entities which contribute to the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which was established in an effort to decrease China&#x27;s reliance on foreign semiconductor companies. The fund was established in 2014.

In 2014, CDB was one of the funders of the Silk Road Fund, along with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China Investment Corporation, and Export-Import Bank of China.

In 2015, China used its foreign exchange reserves to recapitalize CDB, which in turn empowered it to make significant foreign loans.

In 2017, CDB provided RMB 130 billion to fund infrastructure and environmental upgrading in Xiong&#x27;an.

As of December 2018, outstanding loans to 11 provincial-level regions along the belt amounted to 3.85 trillion yuan (about 575 billion U.S. dollars), according to the CDB. New yuan loans to these regions reached 304.5 billion yuan last year, accounting for 48 percent of the bank&#x27;s total new yuan loans. The funds mainly went to major projects in the fields of ecological protection and restoration, infrastructure connectivity, and industrial transformation and upgrading. The CDB will continue to support ecological protection and green development of the Yangtze River in 2019, said CDB Chairman Zhao Huan. China issued a development plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt in September 2016 and a guideline for green development of the belt in 2017. The Yangtze River Economic Belt consists of nine provinces and two municipalities that cover roughly one-fifth of China&#x27;s land. It has a population of 600 million and generates more than 40 percent of the country&#x27;s GDP.

As of at least 2018, CDB was the world&#x27;s largest development bank, with total assets exceeding 16 trillion RMB.

In 2020, China joined the G20-led Debt Service Suspension Initiative, through which official bilateral creditors suspended debt repayments of 73 of the poorest debtor countries. China did not include CDB loans as part of the initiative under the logic that CDB was a commercial lender rather than an official bilateral creditor.

Along with the Silk Road Fund and the Export-Import Bank of China, the China Development Bank is one of the primary financing sources for Belt and Road Initiative projects in Africa, and is an important funder of BRI projects more generally.

== Organizational structure ==
The Governors of the bank report to a Board of Supervisors, who are accountable to the central government. There are four vice governors and two assistant governors. At the end of 2004, CDB had about 3,500 employees. About 1,000 of CDB&#x27;s employees work at the Beijing Headquarters, with the rest in 35 mainland branches; including a representative office in Tibet and a branch in Hong Kong.

As of 2021, the CDB has more than 9,000 employees.

CDB does not accept deposits from individuals. Its depositors are other financial agencies that are collaborating with CDB or entities which are repaying loans borrowed from CDB.

=== Ownership ===
CDB is wholly state-owned through multiple state bodies. As of 2019, the owners were Central Huijin Investment Ltd. (one of China&#x27;s sovereign funds), Buttonwood Investment Holding Company Ltd. (owned by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange), and the National Council for Social Security Fund.

===Subsidiaries===
* China Development Bank International Investment

==Leadership==
CDB has a thirteen member board of directors. Three are the executives in charge of managing CDB. Six are directors from the agencies that hold shares of CDB. The four &quot;government-ministry directors&quot; come from the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, and the People&#x27;s Bank of China.

<text>Frederick William Chesson (1833 – 29 April 1888) was an English journalist and prominent anti-slavery campaigner. He was active in the London Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society and Emancipation Committee, and met Harriet Jacobs when she was in England in 1858; and was a vocal supporter of the Union side during the American Civil War.

In 1855 he married Amelia Thompson, daughter of activist George Thompson (1804–1878). He was also a leading supporter of Sir Charles Dilke, his Member of Parliament, during Dilke&#x27;s scandalous divorce case.

In 1859, Chesson and Thompson founded the London Emancipation Society which strongly supported the Unionist side in the American Civil War. He wrote on Richard Cobden, for his major biography.

<doc id="1145184" wikidata="Q1756576" url="?curid=1145184" title="Submission (2004 film)">
<text>Submission is a 2004 English-language Dutch short drama film produced and directed by Theo van Gogh, and written by Ayaan Hirsi Ali (a former member of the Dutch House of Representatives for the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy); it was shown on NPO 3, a Dutch public broadcasting network, on 29 August 2004. The film&#x27;s title is one of the possible translations of the Arabic word &quot;Islam&quot;. An Islamist reacted to the film by assassinating Van Gogh.

==Content==

The film tells the story of four fictional characters played by a single actress wearing a veil, but clad in a see-through Hijab, her naked body painted with verses from the Quran. The characters are Muslim women who have been abused in various ways. The film contains monologues of these women and dramatically highlights three verses of the Quran (, and ), by showing them painted on women’s bodies.

==Motivation==
Writer Hirsi Ali has said &quot;it is written in the Quran a woman may be slapped if she is disobedient. This is one of the evils I wish to point out in the film&quot;. In an answer to a question about whether the film would offend Muslims, Hirsi Ali said that &quot;if you&#x27;re a Muslim woman and you read the Quran, and you read in there that you should be raped if you say &#x27;no&#x27; to your husband, that is offensive. And that is insulting.&quot;

Director Theo Van Gogh, who was known as a controversial and provocative personality, called the film a &quot;political pamphlet.&quot;

==Reception==
The film drew praise for portraying the ways in which women are abused in accordance with fundamentalist Islamic law, as well as anger for criticising Islamic canon itself. It drew the following comment from movie critic Phill Hall, &quot;&quot;Submission&quot; was bold in openly questioning misogyny and a culture of violence against women because of Koranic interpretations. The questions raised in the film deserve to be asked: is it divine will to assault or kill women? Is there holiness in holding women at substandard levels, denying them the right to free will and independent thought? And ultimately, how can such a mindframe exist in the 21st century?&quot; Film critic Dennis Lim, on the other hand, stated that, &quot;It&#x27;s depressing to think that this morsel of glib effrontery could pass as a serious critique of conservative Islam.&quot; Another (unnamed) critic referred to the stories told in the film as &quot;simplistic, even caricatures&quot;.

After the film&#x27;s broadcast on Dutch television, newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; reported claims of plagiarism against Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh, made by Internet journalist Francisco van Jole. Van Jole said the duo had &quot;aped&quot; the ideas of Iranian-American video artist Shirin Neshat. Neshat&#x27;s work, which made abundant use of Persian calligraphy projected onto bodies, had been shown in the Netherlands in 1997 and 2000.

==Murder of Theo van Gogh==

On 2 November 2004, Van Gogh was assassinated in public by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim with a Dutch passport. A letter, stabbed through and affixed to the body by a dagger, linked the murder to Van Gogh&#x27;s film and his views regarding Islam. It was addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and called for a &quot;jihad&quot; against &quot;kafir&quot; (unbelievers or infidels), against America, Europe, the Netherlands, and Hirsi Ali herself. Following the murder of Van Gogh, tens of thousands gathered in the center of Amsterdam to mourn Van Gogh&#x27;s death. Besides Bouyeri, eleven other Muslim men were arrested and charged with conspiracy to assassinate Hirsi Ali. Bouyeri was jailed for life, for which in the Netherlands there is no possibility of parole, and pardons are rarely granted. Some of the others were convicted of other offences in relation to their involvement in the so-called Hofstad Network, but not for a direct connection with the Van Gogh murder.

<text>Culver Academies is a college preparatory boarding school located in Culver, Indiana, which is composed of three entities: Culver Military Academy (CMA) for boys, Culver Girls Academy (CGA), and the Culver Summer Schools and Camps (CSSC). Culver Military Academy was founded in 1894 by Henry Harrison Culver.

==Facilities==
The Eugene C. Eppley Foundation donated the funds for three classroom buildings that comprise the Gignilliat Memorial Quadrangle. Eppley Auditorium, built in 1959, seats 1,492 people. The new Steinbrenner Performing Arts Center consists of a scene shop, dance studio, and private dance studio.

Culver Academies was expanded with the addition of the 47,000 sq. ft. Huffington Library on October 1, 1993. The building provides a southern terminus to the academic quadrangle while affording library patrons a view of Lake Maxinkuckee. It houses a collection of approximately 55,000 volumes and the academies&#x27; information technology resources.

Henderson Arena is home to Culver Military Academy and Culver Girls Academy hockey teams.

On October 5, 2012, Culver dedicated the White-Devries Rowing Center for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crew teams.
On February 9, 2022, it was announced that Culver Military Academy alumnus George Roberts &#x27;62 has donated $65 million to the construction of Roberts Residential Quadrangle that will replace the existing Main, North, and East barracks.

<text>Brunhilda ( 543 – 613) was queen consort of Austrasia, part of Francia, by marriage to the Merovingian king Sigebert I of Austrasia, and regent for her son, grandson and great-grandson.

In her long and complicated career she ruled the eastern Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Burgundy for three periods as regent for her son Childebert II from 575 until 583; her grandsons Theudebert II and Theuderic II from 595 until 599; and her great-grandson Sigebert II in 613. The period was marked by tension between the royal house and the powerful nobles vying for power.

Brunhilda was apparently an efficient ruler, but this and her forceful personality brought her into conflict with her nobles, the church, and the other Merovingians. Her history is marked by a bitter feud with the former slave Fredegund, mistress and later wife of Chilperic I of Neustria. Fredegund is said to have murdered or ordered the murder of Brunhilda&#x27;s sister, Queen Galswintha (c. 568), to make herself queen. This event launched the 45-year feud which would eventually see Fredegund order the murder of Brunhilda&#x27;s husband, and even have Brunhilda imprisoned for a time. Even after Fredegund&#x27;s death in 597, the feud was continued by her son, Chlothar II, who in 613 defeated Brunhilda in battle and had her executed by being pulled apart by four horses.

==Life==
Brunhilda was possibly born about 543 in the Visigothic capital of Toledo, the younger of the two daughters of Athanagild and Goiswintha. She was only eleven years old when her father was made king in 554. She was educated in Toledo as an Arian Christian.

===First marriage===
In 567, she was married to King Sigebert I of Austrasia, a grandson of Clovis I, who had sent an embassy to Toledo loaded with gifts. She joined him at Metz. Upon their marriage, she converted to Catholicism.

Sigebert&#x27;s father, Chlothar I, had reunited the four kingdoms of the Franks, but when he died, Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. According to historian and bishop Gregory of Tours, Sigebert&#x27;s marriage to a Visigothic princess was a criticism of his brothers&#x27; choices in wives. Instead of marrying a low-born woman, Sigebert chose a princess of education and morals.

In response to Sigebert&#x27;s noble marriage, his brother, Chilperic I of Neustria, sent for Brunhilda&#x27;s sister, Galswintha. Gregory of Tours suggests that he proposed because he envied his brother&#x27;s marriage to Brunhilda; however, Galswintha ordered him to purge his court of courtesans and mistresses and he soon grew tired of her. He and his favorite mistress, Fredegund, conspired to murder her. In 568, an unknown assailant strangled Galswintha while she slept in her bed and Chilperic married Fredegund.

Brunhilda so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister—and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated—that the two queens persuaded their husbands to go to war. Sigebert persuaded their other brother, the elder Guntram of Burgundy, to mediate the dispute between the queens. He decided that Galswintha&#x27;s dower of Bordeaux, Limoges, Cahors, Béarn and Bigorre should be turned over to Brunhilda in restitution. However, Chilperic did not easily give up the cities and Brunhilda did not forget the murder. Bishop Germain of Paris negotiated a brief peace between them.

Between 567 and 570, Brunhilda bore Sigebert three children: Ingund, Chlodosind and Childebert.

The peace was then broken by Chilperic, who invaded Sigebert&#x27;s dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to Tournai. The people of Paris hailed Sigebert as a conqueror when he arrived with Brunhilda and their children. Bishop Germain wrote to Brunhilda, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of his life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at Vitry-en-Artois with poisoned daggers (scramsaxi, according to Gregory). Brunhilda was captured and imprisoned at Rouen.

===Second marriage===
Merovech, the son of Chilperic and his first wife Audovera, went to Rouen on pretext of visiting his mother. While there, he decided to marry the widowed Brunhilda and thus strengthen his chances of becoming a king. His stepmother, Fredegund, was determined that only her sons should succeed as kings and eliminated her husband&#x27;s sons by other women. Merovech and Brunhilda were married by the Bishop of Rouen, Praetextatus. However, since Brunhilda was Merovech&#x27;s aunt the marriage was contrary to canon law.

Chilperic soon besieged them in the church of St Martin on the walls. Eventually he made peace with them, but he took Merovech away with him to Soissons. In an effort to nullify the marriage, Chilperic had Merovech tonsured and sent to the monastery of Le Mans to become a priest. Merovech fled to the sanctuary of St Martin at Tours, which was Gregory&#x27;s church (who was thus an eyewitness to these events), and later to Champagne. He finally returned to Tours in 578 and when his bid for power failed, he asked his servant to kill him.

===First regency===
Brunhilda now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son Childebert II, but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire briefly to the court of Guntram of Burgundy before obtaining her goal. At that time, she ruled Austrasia as regent. Not being a fighter, she was primarily an administrative reformer, with a Visigothic education. She repaired the old Roman roads, built many churches and abbeys, constructed the necessary fortresses, reorganised the royal finances, and restructured the royal army. However, she antagonised the nobles by her continued imposition of royal authority wherever it was lax. To reinforce her positions and the crown&#x27;s prestige and power, she convinced Guntram, newly heirless, to adopt Childebert as his own son and heir. This he did in 577. In 579, she married her daughter Ingunda, then only thirteen, to the Visigothic prince Hermenegild, allying her house to that of the king of her native land. However, Hermenegild converted to Catholicism and he and his wife both died in the ensuing religious wars which tore apart the Visigothic kingdom in Spain.

Brunhilda ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in 583, at the traditional Merovingian majority of thirteen.

===Relations with King Guntram===
The conflict with Fredegund flared up once more upon the death of Chilperic. Now in the regency in Neustria, Fredegund was in a position to renew the war with her old enemy. Simultaneously, Brunhilda had to deal with her own internal enemies.

Many of the dukes strongly opposed her influence over her son Childebert, the king. Three of them—Rauching, Ursio and Berthefrid—conspired to assassinate Childebert; however, their plot was found out. Rauching was killed and Ursio and Berthefrid fled to a fortress. Upon this, Guntram immediately begged for Childebert, Brunhilda and Childebert&#x27;s two sons to take refuge at his court. This they did and soon Ursio and Berthefrid were killed. In 587, Guntram, Childebert and Brunhilda settled the Pact of Andelot securing for Childebert the Burgundian succession and a continuing alliance of the two realms of Austrasia and Burgundy for the rest of Guntram&#x27;s life.

In that same year, King Reccared I of the Visigoths sent embassies to both Childebert and Guntram, the former accepting them and consolidating an alliance and the latter refusing to see them. Thus, when Brunhilda and Childebert negotiated a marriage for the king&#x27;s sister Chlodosind with the king of Spain, it was rejected by Guntram and abandoned. In 592, Guntram died and Childebert, per the treaty, succeeded to his kingdom, immediately making war on Clotaire II of Neustria, Chilperic&#x27;s son by Fredegund. Under Fredegund&#x27;s leadership, Brunhilda&#x27;s troops were routed in the 593 Battle of Droizy. Childebert died in 596 at the age of twenty-six.

===Second regency===
Upon Childebert&#x27;s death, Brunhilda attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons Theudebert II and Theuderic II. Theudebert became king of Austrasia, and Theuderic, king of Burgundy. Though she attributed the death of Childebert to Fredegund, the latter died in 597 and the direct conflict between her and Brunhilda ended. Peace would elude the Franks, however, for many years more as the conflict raged between the two queens&#x27; descendants.

In 599, Brunhilda&#x27;s elder grandson, Theudebert, at whose court she was staying, exiled her. She was found wandering near Arcis in Champagne by a peasant, who brought her to Theuderic. The peasant was rewarded with the bishopric of Auxerre, as the legend goes. Theuderic welcomed her and readily fell under her influence, which was now inclined to vengeance against Theudebert. Soon the brothers were at war.

It is at this point that Brunhilda, now in her later fifties and having survived all the previous tribulations, began to display that ruthlessness which led to her especially violent demise. Brunhilda first took Protadius as lover and, desiring to promote him to high office, conspired to have Berthoald, the mayor of the palace, killed. In 604, she convinced Theuderic to send Berthoald to inspect the royal &quot;villae&quot; along the Seine. Clotaire, in accordance with Brunhilda&#x27;s bidding, sent his own mayor Landric (a former paramour of Fredegund) to meet Berthoald, who had only a small contingent of men with him. Realising that he had been the victim of courtly plotting, Berthoald, in the ensuing confrontation, overchased the enemy until he was surrounded and killed. Protadius was promptly put in his place.

Brunhilda and Protadius soon persuaded Theuderic to return to war with Theudebert, but the mayor was murdered by his warriors, who did not wish to fight to assuage the ego of the queen. The man who ordered Protadius&#x27; execution, Duke Uncelen, was soon arrested by Brunhilda and tortured and executed. He was not the first ducal victim of the queen&#x27;s vengeance.

It was also during these later regencies that Desiderius, Bishop of Vienne (later Saint Didier), publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in 612 before her and Theuderic, with whom she then hired three assassins to murder the bishop at the village now-called Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne.

===Third regency===
The successor of Theuderic II was his son Sigebert, a child. The mayor of the palace of Austrasia, Warnachar, fearing that at his young age he would fall under the influence of his great-grandmother, brought him before a national assembly, where he was proclaimed king by the nobles, who then did homage to him ruling over both his father&#x27;s kingdoms. Nonetheless, he could not be kept out of the influence of Brunhilda. Thus, for the last time in a long life (now in her seventies), she was regent of the Franks, this time for her own great-grandson.

But Warnachar and Rado, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, along with Pepin of Landen and Arnulf of Metz, resentful of her regency, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda over the young king and joined with her old antagonist Clotaire II, promising not to rise in defence of the queen-regent and recognising Clotaire as rightful regent and guardian of Sigebert. Brunhilda, with Sigebert, met Clotaire&#x27;s army on the Aisne, but the dukes yet again betrayed her: the Patrician Aletheus, Duke Rocco and Duke Sigvald deserted her and she and her king had to flee. They fled as far as the city of Orbe (in today French Switzerland), hoping to enlist the aid of certain German tribes, but Clotaire&#x27;s minions caught up with them by Lake Neuchâtel. The young king and his brother Corbo were both killed: thus ended the long and bloody feud between Austrasia and Neustria, and, reuniting the two kingdoms, Clotaire held the entire realm of the Franks.

Clotaire then accused Brunhilda of the death of ten kings of the Franks.
The identity of the ten kings comes from the Fourth Book of the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;. It is usually said to include Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Theudebert II, Theuderic II, Sigebert II, Merovech (Chilperic&#x27;s son), Merovech (Theuderic&#x27;s son), Corbo (Theuderic&#x27;s son) and Childebert (Theuderic&#x27;s son) and the sons of Theudebert, along with many churchmen, including Desiderius. According to the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;:Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted onto a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally she died. Her final grave was the fire. Her bones were burnt.
One legend has her being dragged by a wild mare down the Roman road &quot;La Chaussée Brunehaut&quot; at Abbeville.

==Religion==

Brunhilda was raised as an Arian Christian, but upon her marriage to Sigebert, converted to Catholic Christianity. In general, she protected the church and treated Pope Gregory the Great with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her. Then in 597 he found her useful in resolving a problem that needed redress in the Frankish kingdom, that is, the continued pagan worship of idols and trees, practices which her bishop, Syagrius of Autun, had not sufficiently addressed. When Brunhilda wrote Gregory seeking the pallium for Syagrius, the pope saw his opportunity to address the bishop&#x27;s derelictions, agreeing to grant the request on condition that Brunhilda restrain, under the regulation of discipline, those who were practicing the acts which Syagrius had ignored.

Gregory of Tours was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with Columbanus, abbot of Luxeuil, whom she eventually exiled to Italy, where he founded Bobbio. Brunhilda also played a role in perpetuating the diocese of Maurienne as a suffragan bishopric of the archdiocese of Vienne. In 576, Brunhilda&#x27;s protector, Sigebert&#x27;s brother Guntram, had founded the new bishopric at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, separating the Maurienne Valley and the neighboring Susa Valley from the Diocese of Turin. The Bishop of Turin protested this to Brunhilda for more than twenty years, but even when Pope Gregory the Great supported his complaint in 599, Brunhilda dismissed it.

Brunhilda was buried in the abbey of St. Martin at Autun that she founded in 602 on the spot where the bishop of Tours had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey and her tomb [containing bone, ash and part of a wheel] were destroyed in 1793; however two parts of the cover of Brunhilda&#x27;s sarcophagus are now in the Musée Rolin in Autun.

Brunhilda commissioned the building of several churches and the abbey of St. Vincent at Laon (founded in 580). She is also credited with founding the castle of Bruniquel and having a Roman road resurfaced near Alligny-en-Morvan (where the name of a nearby hill &quot;Terreau Bruneau&quot; is believed to be derived from hers). The part of Mauves-sur-Loire known as &quot;la Fontaine Bruneau&quot; is named after Brunhilda who may have cooled herself with the fountain&#x27;s water when she suffered heat exhaustion.

==In legend==
Many scholars have seen Brunhilda as inspiration for both Brunhild and Kriemhild, two rival characters from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Kriemhild married Siegfried, who in many respects resembles Sigebert, Brunhilda&#x27;s husband. There is resemblance between a multitude of characters and events in the Nibelungenlied and those of the latter half of the sixth century in Merovingian Gaul. As Thomas Hodgkin remarks:

<doc id="1145207" wikidata="Q1328038" url="?curid=1145207" title="Orix Buffaloes">
<text>The are a Nippon Professional Baseball team formed as a result of the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment by the merger of the Orix BlueWave of Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes of Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The team plays in the Pacific League and is under ownership by Orix, a financial services company founded in Osaka.

The combined team began play in 2005. The Buffaloes split home games between Kyocera Dome Osaka, the home of the original Buffaloes franchise, and Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium, the former home of the BlueWave, when the Hanshin Tigers have to use Kyocera Dome. The Tigers&#x27; main home stadium, Hanshin Koshien Stadium, is used for the two biggest high-school tournaments in Japan, the Senbatsu in March, coliding with the opening of the NPB season, and during the Japanese High School Baseball Championship in August.

Through 2022, the club&#x27;s all-time record is 5,543–5,297–410 (.511).

==Franchise history==

===Hankyu/Orix (1936–2004)===

====Hankyu Braves====
The franchise that eventually became the Orix Buffaloes was founded in 1936 under the ownership of a Japanese railway company , as . Later nicknamed the Hankyu Braves, it was one of the first professional baseball teams in Japan, and the oldest surviving team in the Pacific League.

In the early 1950s, the franchise made a dedicated effort to attract foreign talent, particularly African-American veterans of Negro league baseball, including infielders John Britton and Larry Raines, and pitchers Jimmy Newberry and Jonas Gaines. These players were the first Americans other than Wally Yonamine to play Nippon Professional Baseball after World War II.

Starting in the mid-1960s, the Braves became one of the dominant teams not only in the Pacific League but in all of Japanese professional baseball. Between 1967 and 1972, the Hankyu Braves won the Pacific League pennant five times but lost the Japan Series each time against the Yomiuri Giants. Manager Yukio Nishimoto was known as &quot;the great manager in tragedy&quot; because of those losses. But the Hankyu Braves won Japan Series three times in a row from 1975, against the Tokyo Giants in 1976 and 1977, led by manager Toshiharu Ueda. At that time, many good players in Japanese baseball history played for the Hankyu Braves, including pitcher Hisashi Yamada and outfielder Yutaka Fukumoto.

In the 1980s, the team still was a strong contender in the Pacific League, but lost the PL pennant to the Seibu Lions every year except 1984; that year, the Braves fell to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in the Japan Series in seven games.

On October 19, 1988, Hankyu Railway sold the franchise to the lease company Orient Lease (since 1989 known as Orix Group), in what was known as &quot;the longest day of the Pacific League&quot;. The reason is that when the franchise sale occurred, the Kintetsu Buffaloes played the legendary &quot;10.19&quot; double-header for the Pacific League pennant, only to miss the pennant out because of the second game ending in a tie. For Kintetsu to win the pennant, they had to win both games in the doubleheader against the Lotte Orions. The sale was a surprise; at that time, it was much rarer for a Japanese professional baseball team to change owners, not to mention for a large company to sell one of its parts. In that case, Hankyu Railway was thought of as one of the big companies that would never need to do such a thing. The sale was also a surprise, given that prior to Hankyu founder Ichizo Kobayashi&#x27;s death in 1957, he decreed that under any circumstances, Hankyu must never sell the Braves and the Takarazuka Revue, both of which were passion projects of his. As it turned out, however, the Braves had to be sold in order for Hankyu to keep the Revue afloat.

The sale was not without two assurances: the team name would remain &quot;Braves&quot;, and the franchise would stay in Nishinomiya. During the first two years of new ownership, the team was known as the Orix Braves and played in Nishinomiya.

====BlueWave====
In 1991, the team moved to Kobe and became the Orix BlueWave. Orix put out a poll to decide the new name, and unsurprisingly, people voted Braves. It was said that Orix put out another poll and told fans &quot;Braves&quot; was not allowed. What made it worse was in that second poll, &quot;Thunder&quot; was the winning name, which fit the new color scheme (when Orix bought the team, they changed their colors from black and red to navy blue and gold), and because the team&#x27;s batting lineup was named . But, Orix went with &quot;BlueWave&quot;. Longtime fans were shocked by these changes. One member of the Braves&#x27; cheering squad (応援団 &quot;ouendan&quot;) said that &quot;the race was decided before the gun even went off&quot;. Another thing that did not make sense to fans was they were named BlueWave while playing in then-named Green Stadium (now Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium) in a city whose official color is green. However, since Nishinomiya and Kobe are close to one another, and the new home field of the team was better than the old one, most fans accepted the move, although with some nostalgia for the historic &quot;Braves&quot; name. The team was sometimes called by fans and the baseball media, which means &quot;blue wave&quot; in Japanese.

Led by Ichiro Suzuki in 1995 and 1996, the Orix BlueWave won the Pacific League pennant. In 1996, they also won the Japan Series. In 2001, Suzuki moved to the Seattle Mariners and led the Mariners to a 116 win season, the most wins by an American League team.

===Orix Buffaloes (2005 to present)===
Following the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment, the BlueWave merged with the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes. The team struggled since its merger, only finishing in the top half (or A Class) of the Pacific league once from 2005 to 2013. In 2008, The Buffaloes finished second in the Pacific League, going 75–68–1 and finishing games behind the Saitama Seibu Lions, but were swept by the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters at home in the first stage of the Climax Series. After two seasons of finishing last in the Pacific League, they finished first in 2021, going 70–55–18. They swept the Chiba Lotte Marines in the final stage of the Climax Series to make their first Japan Series appearance since 1996. Ultimately, they were defeated by the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in six games. In 2022, despite a rough start to the season, the Buffaloes finished 1st after a 5–2 win over the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles on the final day of the Pacific League regular season, combined with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks losing to the Marines, 5–2, at the same time the game was happening, and also because they had 5 more wins against the Hawks during the regular season, 15–10. The Buffaloes would defeat the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks in the Final Stage of the 2022 Pacific League Climax Series, 4 games to 1, which set up a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s Japan Series, but this time the Buffaloes would exact revenge on the Swallows, defeating them 4 games to 2. Following that campaign, Masataka Yoshida requested to be posted to MLB, and signed with the Boston Red Sox that offseason. In 2023, an 86-53-4 record yielded them their 3rd straight Pacific League pennant, alongside Yamamoto winning his 3rd consecutive Triple Crown. They swept the Chiba Lotte Marines in the final stage of the Climax Series to make their third Japan Series appearance. But, the Buffaloes were defeated by the Hanshin Tigers in seven games. Yoshinobu Yamamoto&#x27;s posting to MLB proved to be too much for the Buffaloes to handle, as without their legendary ace, the Buffaloes fell to a record of 63-77-3, ending the year in 5th place. Following that season, manager Satoshi Nakajima announced he was stepping down after he failed to guide the Buffaloes to their 4th straight pennant. He was replaced with Mamoru Kishida.

<text>From 1839 the trustees of the Marquis of Bute, operated a large dock operation in Cardiff, the &quot;Bute Docks&quot;. This was very successful, but was overwhelmed by the huge volume of coal exported through Cardiff. At the same time it was seen that railway companies, especially the Taff Vale Railway (TVR), were making money conveying the coal to the docks.

The Bute Docks company decided to build a railway from Pontypridd to their dock; they obtained an act of Parliament, the Cardiff Railway Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. cclxii), giving authority for part of the route in 1898, and changed the company name to the Cardiff Railway. To be successful, they needed to make a junction with their main rival, the TVR, at Treforest. A single mineral train traversed the junction in 1909 but legal challenges prevented any further use. The Cardiff Railway had built an expensive railway line that failed to connect with the collieries beyond Pontypridd. The company became part of the Great Western Railway (as did the TVR) in 1923.

A low-key passenger service was operated, and a colliery at Nantgarw was served until 1952. The passenger service was cut back to Coryton in 1931 and continues to operate today.

==Bute Docks==
Already in the 18th century, it was obvious that some improved means was needed to convey coal mined in the South Wales Valleys to wharves on the Bristol Channel. For many of the pits, Cardiff was the nearest and most convenient location, and in 1790 the Glamorganshire Canal opened from Navigation House (Abercynon) to Cardiff.

This represented huge progress, but the canal had 49 locks and did not directly reach the majority of the mineral sites. As iron smelting developed on an industrial scale, the demands of that industry too soon outstripped the transport facilities available.

The first large dock opened in Cardiff on 9 October 1839; it was named the Bute Dock after Lord Bute who was the principal owner. From 8 October 1840 the Taff Vale Railway opened, in stages, from Merthyr to the Bute Dock, later connecting in pits in the Rhondda and elsewhere. The Rhymney Railway too opened its line from the upper part of the valleys, also reaching the Bute Dock.

In 1850 the South Wales Railway opened part of its main line; instead of bringing down minerals from the upper part of the valleys, the South Wales Railway was a trunk line, conceived to connect London (through the developing network of the Great Western Railway) with Milford Haven, and from there to generate a transatlantic shipping connection. The South Wales Railway also required a dock connection in Cardiff, for minerals it brought there from along its own line, and this demand put yet further strain on the docks. A second dock was built, and as the Bute East Dock, it opened on 20 July 1855; the original Bute Dock was renamed the Bute West Dock.

From these years there was continual feuding between the Taff Vale Railway and the Rhymney Railway. Finally on 7 October 1871 the London and North Western Railway secured access to the docks by virtue of running powers over the Rhymney Railway.

==Other docks==
The Bute docks in Cardiff were not the only docks available. From the outset Newport Docks had been a serious rival. Further west, the small harbour at Porthcawl, and the Port Talbot docks were important alternatives, although Porthcawl never developed much. Swansea too, after a late start, became the home of an important dock operation.

Nevertheless, the huge expansion of South Wales steam coal overwhelmed the available dock facilities, and this led to corresponding hostility to the Bute Docks Trustees, who were seen with some justification as happy to take excessive charges for the use of the dock without making adequate steps to enhance the capacity, and more importantly, to modernise the mechanical handling facilities in their dock.

This feeling led to a long-standing desire to build alternative dock facilities in the Cardiff general area. These included Penarth Dock, developed by the Taff Vale Railway, Roath, also developed by the TVR and reached by the building of a new branch line opened in 1888, and Barry Docks. This last was an extensive dock facility laid out with plenty of space and the latest loading aids, with the benefit of new access railways not constrained by the capacity of the existing railways. The Taff Vale Railway had long been criticised for congestion of its lines leading to the Bute docks.

==Building a new railway==
Against this background the trustees of the Earl of Bute decided that they should build a railway line to get access to the lucrative traffic in coal and other minerals from the Rhondda and the upper part of the Taff Valley and the Cynon Valley. This, they believed, would enhance their income from transport to their docks as well as the operation of the docks as such. In 1885 they purchased the moribund Glamorganshire Canal and the Aberdare Canal, with the intention of converting them both into railway lines. This was not proceeded with at once, but in the 1896 session of Parliament the trustees submitted a bill for the purpose.

The Taff Vale Railway saw this as an obvious assault on its established near-monopoly in those areas, and sought to counter-attack by proposing yet another dock near Cardiff, on the east bank of the River Ely opposite Penarth, and a bill was submitted for this work in the 1896 session. Both this and the Bute Bills were rejected, however.
In the following session, both companies tried their proposals once again in Parliament, and this time the Bute Trustees were successful. Their act of Parliament, (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. ccvii), of 6 August 1897 authorised a line from a junction with the Rhymney Railway at Heath to the Taff Vale at Pontypridd, with a junction to the Taff Vale Railway at Treforest. The act authorised the change of name from the Bute Docks to the &quot;Cardiff Railway&quot;, although the dock operation was to be included in the new company&#x27;s activity.


The Taff Vale Railway was alarmed at this development, as it could only result in traffic, and income, being diverted from its line to the Cardiff Railway. Having found success, the Cardiff Railway promoted a further bill in the following session, and was authorised as the (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. cclxii) on 12 August 1898 to build a railway from Roath Dock to its newly authorised line, joining the Rhymney Railway near the junction. Also proposed in the bill was a new line from Heath Junction to the docks, which would have made the Cardiff Railway independent of other lines at the southern end, but this was rejected by Parliament.

==The junction at Treforest==
On 30 January 1902 the board was informed that the construction to Tongwynlais was substantially completed, and at this time the company put details of its proposed junction with the Taff Vale Railway at Treforest to that company for approval.

The terrain at the point chosen by the Cardiff Railway for its junction with the Taff Vale was extremely awkward. The Taff Vale Railway run down the west bank of the River Taff and was closely hemmed in by the hills to the west. Immediately to the east was the River Taff and the Glamorganshire Canal, and then the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway, and then more hills.

The Taff Vale Railway at this point was quadruple track, with the passenger lines on the east side and goods and mineral tracks on the west side. Immediately north of the proposed point of junction, southbound trains could diverge to the lines of the Barry Railway Company. It was a point of contention that many mineral trains were divided at this location, on the running line, with one portion for Cardiff TVR and one for the Barry line.

The Cardiff Railway proposed to join the passenger lines and then make crossovers to the mineral lines—the main object of their railway was of course the mineral traffic. The existing traffic on the TVR was remarkably intensive at this time, and the proposal alarmed the company. They examined the rights of the Cardiff Railway and saw that there were no running powers granted on their own line, nor powers to connect to all four tracks; moreover, they claimed, the alignment proposed by the Cardiff Railway was outside the limits of deviation permitted by the Cardiff Railway Act.



The question went to arbitration, and then to litigation, and judgment was eventually given against the Cardiff Railway. The CR now went to Parliament to seek the powers that had not been granted before, and they obtained an act of Parliament, the (6 Edw. 7. c. clvii), on 4 August 1906, authorising the junction and crossovers they desired. However the junction was not to be opened until the Cardiff Railway had constructed exchange sidings on their own property short of the TVR main line, so that CR engines need not enter TVR tracks.

The space available for the purpose of building the sidings was constrained by the point at which the CR line crossed the River Taff, but the sidings were squeezed in. New proposals for the junction were submitted to the TVR, which again rejected them. The design was said to be dangerous; the location was very busy: 294 trains passed the location in 24 hours, and in addition the Barry section of many trains was separated there; long mineral trains were divided on the running line. The Barry Railway also objected, fearing interference with their own traffic. The exchange sidings were said to be insufficiently long to hold full length trains; the space available was clearly not long enough, unless the sidings were extended over the Taff, which would require a series of bridges for them. There was now a dispute about how long a standard wagon was, and whether new Railway Clearing House recommendations for wagon sizes had been allowed for.

Once again the matter went to arbitration, held by J. C. Inglis of the Great Western Railway, and at length Inglis found in favour of the CR in May 1908; it was now six years after the issue was first raised.

At this time the TVR offered to purchase the Cardiff Railway. With the CR docks operation, this would have been highly advantageous to the TVR, enabling them to take control of the transport of minerals to the docks and loading there. At the same time the Cardiff Railway was now in financial difficulty, having expended a major outlay on the railway and having gained no income from it. Terms were agreed, and the matter went to Parliament in the 1909 session, but Parliament rejected the proposal on the grounds of the reduction in competition that would be caused. The Barry Railway and the Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway Company had opposed it, as well as the TVR.

Meanwhile, having obtained Inglis&#x27;s adjudication in their favour, the Cardiff Railway laid in a temporary junction at Treforest. On 15 May 1909 a revenue-earning coal train from the Bute Colliery at Treherbert passed from the TVR system on to the Cardiff Railway. A directors&#x27; saloon was attached to the train and the Marquis of Bute and directors of the Cardiff Railway travelled in the train; the Marquis travelled on the engine for the actual crossing of the junction. Immediately after this apparent triumph, the Taff Vale Railway demanded that the temporary junction be removed, on the grounds that it was unauthorised and in a location not permitted by Parliament. (In addition it seems likely that Board of Trade approval for the configuration and working of the junction had not been obtained; as it lay in the TVR passenger line this was a requirement.)

==Construction==
The line had been expensive to construct; the &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; described the structure on the line:

The construction of the Cardiff Railway has involved a number of heavy engineering works. There are nine skew bridges, five crossing the Merthyr river, three across the Glamorganshire Canal, and one across the River Taff. Near Nantgawr the River Taff has been diverted. The various cuttings and embankments are mostly of an extensive character. Ten retaining walls, 12 under bridges, 10 over bridges, a short tunnel and a viaduct contributed to the difficult nature of the work. The engineers were Sir Douglas Fox and Mr. H. White, Mr. Herbert E. Allen, M.I.C.E., being resident engineer.

==Impasse==
The Cardiff Railway were now unable to operate across the junction, and indeed never did so again. Having had no income from the line, they decided now to operate a passenger and local goods service on the part of the line up to the junction but short of it.
The line was inspected by Colonel Druitt of the Board of Trade on 18 October 1910, for passenger operation from Heath Junction (with the Rhymney Railway) to &quot;the termination in a field at Treforest&quot;. However the stations were not ready and rolling stock had not even been ordered, and Druitt declined approval.

A second inspection took place on 30 January 1911. This time approval was given. Most of the halts were merely small cleared areas of ground at ground level, and authority was given for operation by single railcars only.
At this time many railway companies had been experimenting with railmotors, generally single coaches with an integrated small steam locomotive. The idea was to enable passenger operation from very low-cost stopping places. In most cases they had retractable steps so that passengers could join and alight at ground level. This was the Cardiff Railway&#x27;s intended passenger operation; in fact at first only Heath had a conventional elevated passenger platform.
The first steam railmotor was delivered from the Gloucester Carriage and Wagon Company on 23 February 1911, and a trailer vehicle a few days later.

A public passenger service was started on 1 March 1911. There were eleven trips each way on weekdays, and five on Sundays. A second railmotor was delivered during March, and during occasional non-availability of the vehicles, a conventional engine was hired in from the Great Western Railway to cover the service. The locomotive sections were subcontracted to Sissons of Gloucester; the passenger sections had first and third class accommodation.

An editorial in the &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; was enthusiastic:
On February 27th the first passenger trip was run on the new railway in one of the handsome rail motor cars which have been built for the Company… The train was started on the Cardiff Railway by the Marquis of Bute, who for a short time took up the position of driver. The passenger train service was publicly commenced on March 1st. The rail motor car by which the traffic is at present conducted makes 11 double journeys daily (5 on Sundays), but, pending the completion of the junction at Treforest, the terminus is at Rhyd-y-Felin.

The first stations were at Heath, Rhubina (the spelling was changed later), Whitchurch, Coryton (originally intended to be called &quot;Asylum&quot;), Glan-y-llyn, Nantgarw, Upper Boat and Rhyd-y-felin. A &quot;Portobello&quot; station was proposed, between Tongwynlais and Glan-y-llyn, but this was not built. Birchgrove was built in GWR days. A station called Treforest, as close as possible to the TVR main line, was contemplated, but probably not actually built and certainly never opened; there would have been difficult pedestrian access problems.
The line was double track throughout and all the stations had &quot;platforms&quot; on both tracks.

There were goods sheds at Whitchurch and Glan-y-llyn, and the goods and mineral traffic was also available to operate from 1 March 1911, but there was very little demand for some considerable time. There was a colliery at Nantgarw on the line, but it too was very slow to pick up, only being commercially productive from 1920.

In 1912 the public passenger service was reduced as an economy measure.

==Grouping==
After World War I the government decided that most of the railways of Great Britain would be compulsorily restructured into one or other of four new large companies, the &quot;groups&quot;. The relevant legislation was the Railways Act 1921. The so-called &quot;Western Group&quot; was eventually named the Great Western Railway, and the old GWR was naturally the dominant part of the new company. Nevertheless, because of the important dock activity, the Cardiff Railway was considered a constituent (not merely a &quot;subsidiary&quot;) of the new GWR.

The Cardiff Railway reported £5.95 million of issued capital, and an income in the year 1921 of £193,973. It had distributed a dividend of 1% on ordinary stock in 1921. It handed over to the GWR 36 locomotives, mostly dock shunters, and 8 passenger vehicles and 43 freight wagons. There were 2,702 employees, reflecting the size of the dock activity rather than the railway.

The new company now had some passenger stations with duplicate names, so that from 1 July 1924 Heath became Heath Halt Low Level; Rhydyfelin became Rhydyfelin Halt Low Level; Whitchurch and Coryton acquired the geographical suffix &quot;Glamorganshire&quot; (or &quot;Glam&quot;).

The section of line north of Rhydyfelin had been retained in operational condition for political reasons by the CR, but as the GWR now owned the TVR lines as well, there was no point in this, and the section north of Rhydeyfelin was placed out of use from 16 September 1924.

The light traffic on the line resulted in a decision to single the line north of Whitchurch, and this was done from 16 May 1928. The passenger business continued to decline due to bus competition, and it was reported that the takings from the passenger business at station north of Coryton were £30 a week in 1930. The line north of Coryton was therefore closed to passenger traffic on 20 July 1931.

==British Railways==
In 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were taken into national ownership, under British Railways. The Nantgarw colliery was buoyant at this time, and the access to it from Coryton was causing operational difficulties, as the signalling had been substantially reduced there. A new connection was installed from the former TVR main line at Taffs Well, crossing the River Taff and joining the extremity of the CR line, giving a new access to the Nantgarw mine, and enabling complete closure of the CR line north of Coryton. This was commissioned on 16 June 1952. The colliery came under threat of closure due to geological exhaustion in 1986 and the spur line was closed in 1990.

==The present day==
The line continued an uneventful existence operating passenger trains to Cardiff.

It has developed into a useful commuter line into Cardiff from Coryton; in 2018 trains run typically at 30-minute intervals; the journey time from Coryton to Cardiff Queen Street is 14 minutes with five intermediate stops.

==Locomotives==
The Cardiff Railway had 36 steam locomotives, all built by private manufacturers, which were acquired by the GWR on 1 January 1922. For details see Locomotives of the Great Western Railway

Only one locomotive survives. Built in 1898, ex-Cardiff Railway 0-4-0ST No.5, GWR No.1338, is restored to working order, and currently preserved at the Didcot Railway Centre.

<text>The United States men&#x27;s national rugby union team, nicknamed the Eagles, represents the United States of America Rugby Football Union in men&#x27;s international rugby union. USA Rugby is the national governing body for the sport of rugby union in the United States, and is a member of Rugby Americas North, one of six regional governing bodies under World Rugby. Until rugby returned to Olympic competition, with sevens at the 2016 Rio Games, the United States was the reigning Olympic rugby champion, having won gold at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics.

 the men&#x27;s Eagles are ranked 15th in the world by the World Rugby Rankings. Their previous highest ranking was 12th, achieved ahead of the 2019 World Cup. The team&#x27;s lowest ranking was 20th, first following a winless campaign in the 2008 Churchill Cup and second for a single week in 2022 during the 2023 World Cup qualifying tournament.

The highest profile tournament in which the men&#x27;s Eagles play is the Rugby World Cup. The men&#x27;s Eagles have played in all but two Rugby World Cups since the tournament began in 1987. The United States is hosting the 2031 Rugby World Cup.

The United States currently compete in the Pacific Nations Cup every Summer. Previously, the U.S. has competed in the now-defunct Churchill Cup and the Pan American Championship. In April 2015, USA Rugby announced the creation of a new, annual International Championship to be contested among the top-6 ranked rugby nations in the Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Uruguay and the United States. The contest was named the Americas Rugby Championship and began in 2016 with the final tournament taking place in 2019. The United States won the 2017 Americas Rugby Championship after drawing with Argentina XV. It was the United States&#x27; first 15-a-side rugby union title in over 90 years. 
== History ==
===Early years: 1872–1913===

Informal football games such as rugby became popular in the United States in the mid-19th century. Rugby union was played as early as 1872 among rugby clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area composed mainly of British expatriates. On December 2, 1882, the first Californian representative rugby team to play an outside opponent, took on a group of rugby-playing ex-Britons, who called themselves the Phoenix Rugby Club of San Francisco. California lost to the Phoenix club 7–4.
The first recorded rugby game in the U.S. was played in May 1874 when local Harvard University hosted Canadian McGill University. The game sparked an interest on college campuses nationwide. In 1876 Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, which largely used the rugby code. In 1886 Harvard&#x27;s Oscar Shafter Howard introduced these rules to the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.

American football was fierce, and as injuries mounted, the public became alarmed at its brutalities and President Theodore Roosevelt threatened to outlaw the sport. Beginning in 1906, rugby union became the game of choice at Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and several other colleges in California. Rugby&#x27;s popularity, however, was short lived, and the sport had died out by the outbreak of World War I.

A California student team toured Australia and New Zealand in 1910, and invited their hosts to return the visit. Australia obliged by touring North America in 1912, and the U.S. national team played its first international match on November 16, 1912 against Australia in Berkeley, California. The visitors won 12–8. A year later, the U.S. hosted New Zealand at the same venue on November 15, 1913, but the Kiwis ran away with the contest 51–3 in front of 10,000 spectators.

===Olympic Gold: 1920 and 1924===
 Following the end of World War I, the U.S. participated in the Inter-Allied Games where they defeated Romania, before losing to a France XV side, a match in which no caps were awarded. Rugby union had not been played competitively in most of the U.S. for more than a decade before the 1920 Olympics. The U.S. Olympic committee decided that because &quot;California is the only state playing Rugby in the US, the Committee will give sanction but no financial aid&quot;. Harry Maloney, coach at Stanford University and then-president of the California rugby union, assembled a mostly California-based team, with seven players from Stanford and six from the University of California, Berkeley. The Olympic Games Committee of the Amateur Athletic Union paid the expenses to transport the team from California to the games in Antwerp. By the time the US Rugby team arrived in Europe, Czechoslovakia and Romania had withdrawn from the competition. France and the U.S. were the only teams left to compete. The U.S. won a shock 8–0 victory over France to earn the gold medal.

The stunned French suggested that the U.S. team tour France, which they did; winning three out of the four matches they played. Between 1920 and 1924, however, rugby union virtually disappeared once again in the U.S., as American football soared in popularity.
The 1924 Paris Olympics caused France to challenge the U.S. to defend its title. Once again, the U.S. Olympic Committee granted permission but no funds. Nonetheless, seven players of the 1920 team dusted off their boots, raised $20,000, found 15 new players including some American football players who had never played in a rugby union match. The assembled U.S. team was again based heavily from Northern California, with 9 Stanford alumni, 5 from Santa Clara, and 3 from Cal. The team headed for England to play some tuneup matches, where they were beaten four times.

The French Olympic Committee (FOC) had scheduled the rugby event to kick off the 1924 Paris Games at Colombes Stadium in Paris. Romania and the U.S. were expected to provide only token opposition for the European champions. On Sunday, May 11, the U.S. defeated Romania 39 to 0, including nine tries.
The final was played at Colombes Stadium on May 18 before an estimated crowd of 30,000–50,000 that had gathered to watch the rugby final and the awarding of the first medal of the 1924 Olympics. Bookmakers set the odds at five to one with a 20-point spread. However, the Americans were not intimidated, and the American captain Babe Slater wrote in his diary before the match &quot;we are sure going to let them know they have been in a battle.&quot; Despite the odds, the U.S. team started well, led by captain Colby &quot;Babe&quot; Slater, and led 3–0 at the half. Heavy tackling by the Americans, derived from American football, intimidated and exhausted the French, as the U.S. scored four tries in the second half to defeat the French 17–3. Rare vintage film footage of the 1924 gold medal match was released in the documentary, &quot;A Giant Awakens: the Rise of American Rugby&quot;.

Shortly after the 1924 Olympics, however, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) removed rugby union as an Olympic sport. Without the Olympic incentive, the sport&#x27;s growth in America collapsed and the game remained dormant.

=== Modern history ===
===The 1960s and 1970s===
The sport then enjoyed a renaissance, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. This created the need for a national governing body to represent the United States in the international rugby community. The United States of America Rugby Football Union (now known as USA Rugby) was formed in 1975 by four territorial organizations (Pacific Coast, West, Midwest, and East). The first Eagles match was played against Australia in 1976, before a crowd of 7,000 at Glover Stadium in Anaheim. The Wallabies won 24–12.

The U.S. also performed well against France in Chicago, losing the game 14–33, in front of 8,000 fans. The next season the Eagles played two internationals, one against England (XV-not capped) at Twickenham on their 1977 United States rugby union tour of England, which they lost 37–11, and the other against Canada, which they also lost, 17–6. The U.S. played the Canadians again in 1978, and defeated them 12–7 in Baltimore. They then travelled to Canada in 1979 and lost 19–12 in Toronto.

===The 1980s===
The U.S. national team came to further prominence during the 1980s, and from the start of the decade, were playing a notably larger number of games every season. They did however lose all three of their games in 1980, all at home. They could not muster up a win in 1981 either, losing 3–6 to Canada, and 7–38 to South Africa, in what was considered to be the lowest attended international rugby match, with only 30 spectators present at a private polo ground in Glenville, New York. In 1982, the U.S. drew Canada 3–3. They travelled to Australia in 1983 to play the Wallabies, and lost 49–3 in Sydney. The U.S. played its first-ever match against Japan in 1985, winning 16–15 at the Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium.

The U.S. participated in 1987 in the first ever Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia. The U.S. were in Pool 1, alongside co-hosts Australia, England and Japan. The U.S. won their first ever World Cup game, defeating Japan 21–18 at Ballymore Stadium in Brisbane, with fullback Ray Nelson scoring 13 points. The U.S. lost both subsequent matches; 47–12 against the Wallabies and 34–6 against England. The U.S. finished third in the pool, out of contention for the quarterfinals.

The Eagles first met Wales at Cardiff in November 1987 as the final match of their 1987 tour, where Wales, who had just finished third in the inaugural Rugby World Cup, enjoyed a 46–0 win. In 1988, the Eagles had mixed success in their tour of Europe, defeating Romania but losing to the Soviet Union.

===The 1990s===
The U.S. notched three consecutive wins from September 1990 to May 1991 — all against Japan — for the first three-match win streak in U.S. team history.

The U.S. made their way through a qualifying tournament to reach the 1991 Rugby World Cup in the United Kingdom, pooled with defending champions New Zealand, hosts England, and Italy in a tough group. In their first match of the tournament, Italy defeated them 30–9. Next, New Zealand defeated them 46–6. Hosts England won 37–9 at Twickenham. The U.S. finished fourth in the pool.

The Eagles came close to beating an Australian XV side, at Riverside in 1993, losing 22–26.

In round one of the Americas qualifying tournament for the 1995 Rugby World Cup the U.S. defeated Bermuda 60–3 to advance to round two. Argentina defeated the Eagles twice in close games in the series to qualify, leaving the U.S. missing out on the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa.

The Eagles had a successful tour of Europe in 1998, beating Spain and Portugal. Also in 1998, the U.S. played Fiji for the first time, losing 9–18 in Suva.

The Eagles set out to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. In round four of the Americas qualifying tournament in Buenos Aires, the United States lost 52–24 to Argentina and 31–14 to Canada, but defeated Uruguay 21–16 in their last game to qualify for the 1999 tournament. The U.S. played in the 1999 Pacific Rim Championship, notching its first-ever victories over Fiji (25–14) and Tonga (30–10).

However, the Eagles subsequently suffered their heaviest defeat ever, losing 106–8 to England in a warmup match before the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

The Eagles entered the 1999 Rugby World Cup in pool E alongside Australia, Ireland and Romania. In their first game, the United States went down 53–8 to Ireland. They then lost to Romania 27–25. Australia defeated the Eagles 55–19 in their final game of the tournament, seeing the Eagles finish fourth in the pool. The Eagles, however, had the honor of being the only side to score a try against the eventual champions, Australia, during the entire tournament.

===The 2000s===
In qualifying matches for the 2003 Rugby World Cup the U.S. finished third in the Americas. The U.S. won the repechage and qualified for the 2003 tournament by beating Spain 62–13 and 58–13. The Super Powers Cup was first contested in 2003 between Japan, Russia and the United States. The U.S. then followed up with victories over Japan and Canada. This was the first time the Eagles had won four consecutive tests since making their international debut in 1976.

At the 2003 Rugby World Cup the Eagles finished fourth of five in their pool. In the first match against Fiji, the Americans led 13–3 early in the second half, but Fiji regained the lead and secured a 19–18 win, with the Eagles suffering their ninth consecutive World Cup loss. The U.S. then lost to Scotland. The Americans defeated Japan 39–26, behind 17 points by Mike Hercus, for their first win in a Rugby World Cup since 1987 (also against Japan). The U.S. closed the tournament with a loss to France, concluding the tournament with a 1–3 record.

The 2004 Super Powers Cup saw the addition of Canada. The U.S. beat Russia in the third-place play-off. The U.S. toured Europe in November 2004, losing 55–6 to Ireland and 43–25 to Italy. The 2005 Super Cup took part between the U.S., Canada, Japan and Romania. The U.S. lost 30–26 to Canada but beat a Romanian team stripped of their France-based players 23–16 in the third place play-off.
The U.S. campaign to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup began in 2006. The U.S. lost 56–7 to Canada, resulting in a home/away play-off against Uruguay. The U.S. defeated Uruguay 42–13 in the first match and 26–7 in the second to send them through to the Rugby World Cup.

In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the U.S. joined England, Samoa, South Africa and Tonga in Pool A. The Eagles, ranked 13th in the world standings, lost all 4 games in Pool A, scoring 1 bonus point in the game against Samoa. Coached by New Zealander Peter Thorburn, the Eagles started off with tough match against the defending world champions England, losing 28–10. The U.S. was then beaten by Tonga 25–15, lost to Samoa 25–21, and lost their final match to highly favored South Africa 64–15. The Eagles, however, had a major highlight in the South Africa match. After a Todd Clever interception and a pair of passes, Takudzwa Ngwenya sped down the sideline and outran the speedster Bryan Habana to score a try that received Try of the Year honors at the 2007 IRB Awards.

Following the resignation of Scott Johnson, on March 5, 2009 Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan was named the new national coach.

The Eagles finished a solid 2009 campaign at a mark of 4–5, with a 4–3 record in full internationals. In the 2009 Churchill Cup, the Eagles lost to Ireland and Wales, but defeated Georgia to take home the Bowl.

===The 2011 Rugby World Cup cycle===
The Eagles split a World Cup qualifying series with Canada, but lost on aggregate points. The Eagles then faced Uruguay in a two-game playoff. In November 2009, the United States booked their place at the 2011 Rugby World Cup with two wins against Uruguay, winning the home leg 27–6 in Florida.

The Eagles played 7 matches in 2010: 3 home matches in June at the Churchill Cup, finishing with a 1–2 record, and 4 matches in Europe in the Fall, finishing 1–3.
In the June 2010 Churchill Cup, the US beat Russia 39–22, before losing to the England Saxons 32–9 and France A 24–10. 
For the November 2010 tests, the Eagles traveled to Europe. The Eagles defeated Portugal 22–17, but lost to Scotland A 25–0, and lost to Georgia 19–17. 
The Eagles finished 2010 ranked 16th in the world, and with a record in test matches of 2 wins (Russia, Portugal) and 1 loss (Georgia).

The buildup to the 2011 Rugby World Cup started in June with three matches in the Churchill Cup. The Eagles dropped their first matches to the England Saxons 87–8 and to Tonga 44–13, before defeating Russia 32–25. 2011 was the final Churchill Cup.
The Eagles finalized their 2011 Rugby World Cup preparations with three test matches in August. The Eagles lost to Canada 28–22, lost their second match against Canada 27–7. and lost to Japan 20–14. The Eagles had a 1–5 record in test matches for the year in their preparations for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
In their 2011 Rugby World Cup opening match against Ireland the Eagles defense initially held, before conceding their first try at the 39&#x27; mark. The final tally was 22–10.
The Eagles came into the World Cup with their measuring mark for success as being a win over Russia. The Americans took a 10–3 lead into the half, and held on to win 13–6.
For their third match, Australia dominated, leading to the final result of 67–5, the worst defeat a U.S. team has ever suffered to Australia.
The final match saw the Eagles playing Italy for a third-place finish in Pool C. The Italians finished with a 27–10 victory. The defeat marked the end of the 2011 Rugby World Cup for the U.S.

The Eagles finished 2011 with a record of 2–7 in full tests. The performances in the Rugby World Cup showed improvement, and the win over Russia left the team with a 1–3 RWC record and feeling as a modest success. The World Cup also saw prop Mike MacDonald become both the most capped Eagle in World Cup play (11 caps) and the most capped Eagle of all time at 65 caps. Also notable was the performance of lock John van der Giessen, who achieved the most lineout steals of all players in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, despite appearing in only three matches.

===The 2015 Rugby World Cup cycle===
The Eagles played three matches in North America during the 2012 June international window. This was a regular series of international tests for the United States against Tier 1 (Italy) and Tier 2 (Canada, Georgia) opponents, as the Churchill Cup is no longer held. The highlights of the June tests were a win over higher-ranked Georgia, and a match against Italy at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston that drew a record crowd of 17,214.
The Eagles also played three matches in Europe during the November 2012 tests. The Eagles finished their European tour with 2 wins (Romania, Russia) and 1 loss (Tonga) — the first time since 1998 that the Eagles had concluded a European tour with a winning record — and improved in ranking from 17th to 16th.

The U.S. played five matches during the June 2013 international test window, with one test match against Ireland and four matches as part of the 2013 IRB Pacific Nations Cup. The U.S. started with competitive matches against Canada (9–16), Ireland (12–15), and Tonga (9–18), but finished with double-digit losses against Fiji (10–35) and Japan (20–38), and sliding to #18 in the rankings.
In August 2013, the U.S. played a home-and-away series against Canada as part of qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The U.S. lost both matches by an aggregate score of 20–40, meaning the U.S. must play Uruguay in 2014 as part of 2015 RWC qualifying.
In November 2013, the U.S. lost 19–29 to the Māori All Blacks at PPL Park in Philadelphia before a sold-out crowd of 18,500.

Throughout late 2013 and early 2014, a number of U.S. players signed contracts to play professionally overseas. Of the players called into the U.S. national team in March 2014 for two home-and-away 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay, 14 of the 26 were playing professionally overseas, with 10 playing professionally in England.
The Eagles defeated Uruguay 59–40 on aggregate over two tests during 2014 to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. During the June 2014 test window, the U.S. played competitive matches against higher ranked Scotland and Japan, and the test window culminated with a 38–35 victory over Canada. Subsequently, in November 2014 the Eagles were defeated 74–6 by New Zealand in a match played in front of a crowd of more than 61,000 spectators at Soldier Field, Chicago.

The Eagles began a lengthy assembly in build up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup with the 2015 Pacific Nations Cup. On July 18, the U.S. dropped the opening PNC match 21–16 to Samoa. The team bounced back to upset Japan 23–18. The Eagles, however, fell to Tonga in the final preliminary match for the PNC 33–19. In the resulting fifth-place match, the Eagles edged rival Canada 15–13. The victory was the second consecutive over team Canada. Three weeks later, Canada and the U.S. met again in a World Cup warmup match. For the first time, the U.S. laid claim to a three-match win streak over team Canada after defeating the Canadians 41–23. Continuing on the road to the World Cup, the U.S. faced off against English Premiership side Harlequins, where the Americans fell to the visitors 24–19. The Eagles returned to Soldier Field to compete against the #2 ranked Australia Wallabies. The Americans trailed 14–10 at the half. In the second half, the Wallabies capitalized on American errors and pushed the match out of reach: Australia 47, the U.S. 10.

===Professionalization of the domestic league (2016–present)===

The Professional Rugby Organization (PRO Rugby) began a professional rugby competition in 2016. Five teams played a 10-match schedule from April to July. Each PRO Rugby team had a quota for overseas players and U.S. Eagles internationals. The U.S. national team included 14 professionals in the starting lineup for the June 2015 test against Italy — six U.S.-based professionals and eight overseas professionals. PRO Rugby did not last long, however, with the competition folding after only one season.

Professional rugby returned in 2018 with the advent of Major League Rugby, a seven-team competition that runs from April to early July. U.S. head coach Gary Gold called up an all-professional squad for the June 2018 tests, drawing from a mix of Major League Rugby players and overseas professionals. During the June 2018 tests, the U.S. defeated Scotland 30–29 to give the U.S. its first win over a Tier 1 nation since beating France at the 1924 Olympics. In the November tests, the U.S added wins against Canada (42–17), Samoa (30–29), and Romania (31–5) to ensure their longest full international test win streak in team history with 10. The streak ended with a defeat to Ireland in Dublin. In their first match of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, they were defeated (45–7) against England.

In 2022, the Eagles failed to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since the 1995 edition having participated in the prior six tournaments. In the Final Qualification Tournament they drew with Portugal 16–16, but as a result of a points difference, Portugal advanced to their second-ever Rugby World Cup. Earlier in the qualification process the U.S. lost a two-game series, 50–34 to Uruguay and then lost by a single point to Chile on aggregate.

===Record against Tier 1 teams===
The following table shows the top ten best U.S. results in test matches against Tier 1 opponents.

==Rivalry with Canada ==
The United States&#x27; biggest rival is Canada, having played more test matches against Canada than any other nation. The two teams first met in 1977, and have played every year since then with the exceptions of 2010 and 2020, 2022–2023. As of the end of 2024, the two sides have met 66 times, with 25 wins for the U.S., 39 wins for Canada, and 2 draws.

The U.S. and Canada routinely play each other in qualifying matches for the Rugby World Cup. They have met in the qualification stages for every tournament, with the exception of the 1987 invitational tournament and the 1995 tournament, for which Canada had automatically qualified by reaching the quarterfinals in the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Between 2016 and 2019, the teams played each other annually in the now defunct Americas Rugby Championship.

==Rugby World Cup==

The United States has qualified for every Rugby World Cup except the 1995 and 2023 tournament. The best result that the U.S. has managed at a Rugby World Cup is to win one game, which it accomplished in 1987, 2003, and again in 2011.

==Stadiums and attendance==
The Eagles do not have an official home stadium. Boxer Stadium in San Francisco was the unofficial home of the Eagles from 1996 to 2000, hosting 12 of their 17 test matches. The Eagles also played several of their home games at Infinity Park in Glendale, Colorado. The Eagles played a home match against a Tier 1 nation every June between 2012 and 2014, in front of large crowds at BBVA Stadium in Houston, Texas. Since 2012, the Eagles have played at other MLS stadiums, such as Talen Energy Stadium in Philadelphia and the Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles. The Eagles play some of their less high-profile matches at smaller soccer venues.

The highest attended matches with greater than 10,000 fans played in the U.S. involving the U.S. national team are:

;Notes

*The international rugby match in the U.S. with the largest crowd did not involve the United States national team; 61,500 watched Ireland defeat New Zealand 40–29 at Soldier Field on November 5, 2016.

==Other U.S. national teams==
===USA Falcons===

The USA Falcons, formerly the USA Selects is the second national rugby team for the United States. The USA Falcons is a developmental team, usually fielding younger players looking to break into the U.S. national team, and sometimes including amateur domestic U.S. national team players who need more high-level matches.

The USA Selects formerly participated in the Americas Rugby Championship, when the tournament only featured &quot;A&quot; sides for Argentina, Canada, the United States, and Uruguay. The USA Selects best results in the ARC were their second-place finishes in 2013 and 2014 Since 2016, the ARC only features an A team from Argentina along with the national sides of Brazil, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, and the United States. The USA Falcons now play in a separate tournament known as the Americas Pacific Challenge.

===Women&#x27;s national team===

The U.S. women&#x27;s national team, officially formed in 1987, has been an international powerhouse since its inception, although more recently have fallen behind other powerhouses such as England and New Zealand on the world rankings. The Eagles won the first official World Cup in 1991, and finished second in the two following World Cups (1994, 1998). The Eagles have set a high standard for international competition, leading an ensuing wave of women&#x27;s rugby growth and game development worldwide. The US finished 7th in the 2002 tournament. The women&#x27;s national team traveled to the United Kingdom in January 2006 to play Scotland, Ireland and England, winning all three games. The 2006 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup was held in Edmonton, Canada.

<text>DSC Arminia Bielefeld (; full name: ; commonly known as Arminia Bielefeld (), also known as &quot;Die Arminen&quot; or &quot;Die Blauen&quot; ), or just Arminia (), is a German sports club from Bielefeld, North Rhine-Westphalia. Arminia is most well known as a professional football club, having participated in the first tier of German Football, the Bundesliga, for a total of 19 seasons. In addition to football, the club offers field hockey, figure skating, and cue sports departments. The club has over 15,000 members and the club colours are black, white and blue. Arminia&#x27;s name derives from the Cheruscan chieftain Arminius, who defeated a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

The club currently participates in the 3. Liga, the third tier of German Football. Arminia has earned a reputation as a Yo-yo club, or &quot;Fahrstuhlmannschaft&quot; in German, for its regular promotions and relegations. The club tied the record for most promotions to the Bundesliga in 2020 with their eighth promotion, a record they hold jointly with 1. FC Nürnberg. In the 2010s, the club primarily participated in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier, with two relegations into the third tier. Notable successful periods for the club include the 1980s and 2000s; two separate eras when the club played for five consecutive years in the Bundesliga. In addition, the 1920s were successful for the club, during which two West German Championships were won in 1922 and 1923. Unsuccessful eras for the club include the 1950s and early 1990s, wherein the club participated in the regional third tier of German football for eight and seven consecutive seasons, respectively.

Arminia has played their home games at the Bielefelder Alm Stadium since 1926. The stadium has been entirely rebuilt since the club first played there, with the last major renovations being completed in 2008. The stadiums current capacity of 27,332 consists of space for 7,940 in terracing and 19,392 seats. Since 2004, the stadium has been named &quot;SchücoArena&quot; through a sponsorship deal.

Arminia&#x27;s fans primarily originate from the Eastern Westphalia and Lippe regions, or &quot;Ostwestfalen-Lippe&quot; region in German. As of 2020, the club had 241 active Supporters&#x27; groups. The first organized supporters group formed in 1974, influenced by similar groups in English Football. Organized support from such groups at home matches is provided by fans in the south stand of the stadium.

==History==

===Founding and early years (1905–1918)===
Arminia Bielefeld was founded on 3 May 1905 as &quot;1. Bielefelder FC Arminia&quot;. The fourteen men who founded the club were from the local bourgeoisie. Two weeks later, the club played its first match against a team from Osnabrück. Neither the name of the opponent nor the result are known. The club was admitted to the German Football Association in the same year and started to play in a league (in one consisting only of Arminia and three teams from Osnabrück, at first) in 1906. In 1907, local rivals &quot;FC Siegfried&quot; joined Arminia, a move which strengthened Arminia&#x27;s squad. Soon other clubs from Bielefeld joined League football.

After playing on various grounds, Arminia moved to a new home at the Pottenau in 1910. Their first league championship came during the 1912–13 season, when they won the Westphalian championship beating BV 04 Dortmund 5–1 in the final. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Arminia&#x27;s rise, and between 1914 and 1918 the club played at the district level.

===West German Champions and &quot;The Alm&quot; (1918–1933)===
In 1919, Arminia merged with &quot;Bielefelder Turngemeinde 1848&quot; to form &quot;TG Arminia Bielefeld&quot;. However, the two merged teams dissolved the merger in 1922 and both parent clubs were formed again. Arminia won the West German championship in 1922. Originally, they were level on points with Kölner BC 01, but Köln fielded an ineligible player in one match. Arminia played for the first time in the German Championships, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 0–5 to FC Wacker München. In 1923, Arminia won their second West German championship in a dramatic way. They trailed TuRU Düsseldorf 1–3 at half time of the final, but came from behind to win 4–3 after extra time. Arminia faced Union Oberschöneweide in the quarter-finals of the German championships. The match ended goalless, so a replay was held. Arminia led 1–0 and conceded the equalizer in injury time. The Berlin side won the match after extra time. Walter Claus-Oehler became Arminia&#x27;s first player to win a cap in the German national team. Arminia won further Westphalian titles from 1924 to 1927, but were unable to repeat their success in the West German Championships. A match between SC Preußen Münster and Arminia in November 1925 was the first football match to be broadcast on German Radio. On 30 January 1926, the club took its current name &quot;Deutscher Sportclub Arminia Bielefeld&quot;. Their next piece of silverware was won in 1932 by winning the Westphalian cup.

===Arminia during the Nazi regime (1933–1945)===
In 1933, Arminia qualified for the Gauliga Westfalen, from which they were relegated after the inaugural season. Three attempts of gaining promotion failed before their return to the top flight was won in 1938. Their best performance in the Gauliga was the 1939–40 campaign, where Arminia finished second. Two years later, Arminia was one of only two teams to win a match at Schalke 04. On 25 July 1943 Arminia merged with local rivals &quot;VfB 03 Bielefeld&quot;. The merger finished the 1943–44 season in last place.

===Post World War II years (1945–1962)===

After World War II, a new league with all teams who competed in the Gauliga Westfalen was formed. Arminia were relegated and were unable to win re-promotion. In 1947–48, Arminia were a third division side for the first time in their history. After a dominating season in the Bezirksklasse, Arminia was docked 14 points because they fielded an ineligible player. The next season was already under way when the Landesliga (II) was expanded by two teams. Arminia took their chance, won the league and gained promotion to the Oberliga West.

Arminia&#x27;s time in the Oberliga lasted only one season. Arminia beat Schalke 04 4–2 at home but finished only second from the bottom. In 1954, Arminia were even relegated to the third tier, the &quot;Landesliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen&quot;, a league only covering the north-eastern part of Westphalia. In 1956, Arminia qualified for a new third tier, the &quot;Verbandsliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen&quot;, which encompassed a slightly larger area.

===Promotion to the Bundesliga (1962–1970)===
In 1962 Arminia become a second division side again (then: 2. Liga West, covering the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia). In 1962–63 they finished in seventh place to secure a spot in the newly formed Regionalliga West, which was situated directly below the new Bundesliga.

Arminia finished their first season in mid-table, but recorded a top-half finish in 4 of the following 5 seasons. In 1966, Arminia beat Alemannia Aachen to win the West German Cup for the first time. A year later, forward Ernst Kuster joined the team; he would become the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer (more than half a century later, Fabian Klos would beat his record). A 0–1 loss to Wuppertaler SV on the last day of the 1966–67 season stopped Arminia entering the Bundesliga promotion play-offs. Arminia were runners-up in the 1969–70 season, and won their first promotion to the Bundesliga after a 2–0 win at Tennis Borussia Berlin in the play-offs.

===Bundesliga scandal and return (1970–1980)===
Halfway through their first Bundesliga season, Arminia was in 17th place, a relegation position, but went on to finish the season in 14th. However, near the end of the season, Horst-Gregorio Canellas revealed that Arminia had engaged in match-fixing; three of the ten Bundesliga games proven by the DFB to have been manipulated through bribery directly involved Arminia. Two players at the club were banned from football for life (Waldemar Slomiany and Jürgen Neumann). Arminia participated in the 1971–72 Bundesliga season while the investigation was ongoing, but were ultimately found guilty of match fixing by the DFB and were denied a license and forcibly relegated at the conclusion. Arminia finished mid-table in the following seasons, but did qualify for the newly formed 2. Bundesliga in 1974.

After two seasons in mid-table, Arminia became &quot;Herbstmeister&quot;, during the 1976–77 2. Bundesliga season, but ultimately finished as runner-up behind FC St. Pauli. They faced TSV 1860 München in a two-legged play-off whose winner would win promotion to the top flight. Arminia won the first match at home 4–0, but lost the second leg in Munich 0–4. A third match had to be played in Frankfurt, which Munich won 2–0.

The team returned to win promotion to the Bundesliga during the following 1977-78 season. Arminia started mid-table and on 10 March 1979, they won 4–0 at Bayern Munich. However, Arminia finished the season in 16th place, unable to avoid relegation. The club kept the team together and were promoted back to the Bundesliga after a record-breaking 1979–80 season. They won 30 of 38 matches, scored 120 goals, had a 28 match unbeaten streak and set a league record by beating Arminia Hannover 11–0.

===Establishment in the Bundesliga (1980–1985)===
Arminia had difficulty avoiding relegation, but stayed in the Bundesliga for five years, a period which included two eighth-place finishes at the end of the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons. Furthermore, Arminia took part in the UEFA Intertoto Cup three times.

Arminia Bielefeld midfielder Ewald Lienen was victim to what the press referred to as &quot;the most brutal foul in Bundesliga history&quot; on August 14, 1981. Werder Bremen defender Norbert Siegmann slashed Lienen&#x27;s right thigh in a tackle, exposing his muscles and femur. Despite the clubs&#x27; record high Bundesliga eighth-place finish in 1983 and 1984, attendances declined in the mid-1980s enlarging the club&#x27;s financial problems. In 1984–85, Arminia finished third from the bottom, and lost the relegation play-offs against 1. FC Saarbrücken.

===Decline to the Oberliga (1985–1994)===
The team did not gain promotion and in the fall of 1987, Arminia had debts of 4.5 million Marks. In 1987–88 the club finished in last place in the 2. Bundesliga as a result of these debts and was relegated into the Oberliga Westfalen. Ernst Middendorp became the new manager and assembled a young team for the new season. Arminia led the way in the Oberliga, but finished in second position in 1988–89. They won the Oberliga a year later, but the promotion play-offs against VfB Oldenburg and TSV Havelse did not got their way. Four seasons of not qualifying for the 2. Bundesliga promotion playoffs followed, in which the team started well, but were unable to compete for the championship. In 1991, Arminia won the Westphalian Cup, the regional qualification cup for the DFB-Pokal, and beat FSV Mainz 05 in the first round of the 1991-92 DFB-Pokal.

===Resurgence and yo-yo era (1994–2004)===
In the spring of 1994, Arminia signed veteran Bundesliga players Thomas von Heesen, Armin Eck and Fritz Walter. Arminia struggled at first but went on to become champions of the newly formed Regionalliga West/Südwest and runners-up in the 1995–96 2. Bundesliga. Arminia signed Stefan Kuntz for the 1996–97 Bundesliga season, their first in 11 years and finished in 14th position.

The club signed the first two Iranian Bundesliga players in 1997 with the addition of Ali Daei and Karim Bagheri. In addition, former SK Brann player Geirmund Brendesæter was signed and played 13 matches for the club in 1997. However, after a poor run after the winter break, Arminia were relegated shortly after Brendesæter had left the club. Bruno Labbadia became the league&#x27;s top scorer with 28 goals during the 1998–99 season and the club immediately regained promotion to the Bundesliga by winning the 2. Bundesliga. The club entered the 1999–2000 season with a smaller budget due to financial problems and was subsequently relegated after becoming the third team in history to lose ten matches in a row.

Arminia struggled against relegation again the next season and avoided to drop into the Regionalliga with a 13th-place finish. In the following year, Arminia won their sixth promotion to the Bundesliga in 2001–02, with Artur Wichniarek scoring 18 goals. Arminia were unable to avoid relegation the following season, earning only two points from the last six matches.

===Bundesliga reestablishment (2004–2009)===
The team earned promotion to the Bundesliga again in 2003–04, with Ghanaian striker Isaac Boakye scoring 14 goals in his debut season. They stayed in the top flight until 2009. In 2004–05, Patrick Owomoyela became Arminia&#x27;s most capped German player with his third appearance for the national team. Owomoyela went on to appear in 6 national team matches at Bielefeld, a club record that still stands as of 2024. Both Owomoyela and Delron Buckley, scorer of 15 Bundesliga goals during the 2004–05 season, departed the club. In the DFB-Pokal, Arminia reached the semi-finals in 2005 and 2006. In both seasons, Arminia also kept away from the relegation zone virtually the whole time (except the season&#x27;s beginnings). The campaign &quot;Aktion 5000 +&quot; began to in an effort to increase club membership beyond their 5,000th member, after reaching the 5,000th member milestone at the end of 2005. The 2007 demolition of the East Stand drew the attention of fans and the local media, with the club establishing a webcam to follow the project, as well as a daily attendance of roughly 300 fans to witness the works. The East Stand was notable at the time as being the last terraced stand along the touch line.

Players from the 2004–05 and the 2005–06 season departed the club, including Fatmir Vata and Heiko Westermann in 2007, Mathias Hain, Sibusiso Zuma and Petr Gabriel in 2008. Arminia avoided relegation during the 2006–07 season in part by winning four matches from the 30th to the 33rd matchday, led by manager Ernst Middendorp. The 2007–08 season began with the club winning 3 of its first 5 matches, resulting in the club being in second place by the fifth matchday. Despite this second place start, Arminia recorded its second largest Bundesliga defeat three matchdays later with an 8:1 away loss to Werder Bremen. Relegation was avoided only on the final matchday with 34 points due to 1. FC Nürnberg losing at home while Arminia drew against VfB Stuttgart. The following season, Arminia finished in last place and were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga.

===Financial trouble and 3. Liga (2009–2015)===
Players Rüdiger Kauf, Dennis Eilhoff, Jonas Kamper and Radim Kučera remained a part of the squad for the 2009–10 2. Bundesliga season. On 16 March 2010, Arminia were deducted four points for breaching the DFL&#x27;s licensing regulations. Arminia were in 5th place prior to the point deduction, and finished the season in 7th place. their chances of promotion. The financial situation worsened, especially as costs for constructing the East Stand had proven to be much higher than originally planned for in 2007. The coach, the managing director and the club&#x27;s president were replaced in the summer break. The 2010–11 season started with Arminia in last place after 11 matchdays, having earned only 4 points. In November manager Christian Ziege was let go and replaced by Ewald Lienen, former Bielefeld player and member of the fan-voted &quot;Best XI&quot; of all time. However, Arminia picked up 16 points and won only four games all season resulting in a last place finish and relegation to the 3. Liga.
A new team had to be formed with players formerly unknown in Bielefeld who would leave their mark on the following seasons: Patrick Platins, Manuel Hornig, Tom Schütz, Sebastian Hille, Thomas Hübener, Patrick Schönfeld, Johannes Rahn and from the second half of the season onwards especially Fabian Klos who would coin a whole era. Another formative player, Stefan Ortega Moreno, joined from the club&#x27;s youth. After a poor start, they ended the 2011–12 season in 13th place. They also won the Westphalia Cup, in a final against arch rival SC Preußen Münster. By reaching the final, they also qualified for the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal, where they beat SC Paderborn 07, a team playing in the 2. Bundesliga, but lost in the second round in a close match against Bayer 04 Leverkusen, a Europa League participant. On 11 May 2013, Bielefeld beat VfL Osnabrück 1–0 to guarantee a top two finish and promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga for the 2013–14 season.

That season began quite hopeful: Arminia qualified for the second round of the DFB-Pokal again and at the 8th matchday they had even climbed up to the 3rd rank in the league table. But after a disastrous autumn and a mediocre winter Arminia fell down onto the 17th rank and the popular coach Stefan Krämer – the first manager having held office for more than two years since 2004 – had to leave. His successor Norbert Meier at first had only little more success: Arminia finished 16th in the 2. Bundesliga, and lost a playoff against SV Darmstadt 98 on away goals after a 122nd minute (extra time) goal gave Darmstadt the victory. Arminia had to go back into the 3. Liga.

But the next season could wipe out the bitterness of that disaster: In the 2014–15 DFB-Pokal, as a 3. Liga club, Arminia reached the semi-finals by defeating three Bundesliga teams (Hertha BSC, SV Werder Bremen and VfL Borussia Mönchengladbach). They also were the top team in the 3. Liga (after a bad beginning with only four points from the first four matches) for most part of the season. After the loss against VfL Wolfsburg in the semi-final of the DFB-Pokal, Arminia seemed to have lost their ability to win their matches in the 3. Liga as well. Even the qualification for the 2. Bundesliga seemed to become doubtful, but was secured after a 2–2 draw against SSV Jahn Regensburg, the last team in the league table, at the 37th matchday. Liberated from the pressure of a possible non-qualification, they also won the 3. Liga with a final 1–0 victory at the last matchday.

===Sporting and financial recovery (2015–2020)===
A stable season with a defeat in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, a lot of draws in the league (especially in the beginning: eight out of ten matches; in the end Arminia reached a record of 18) and only very few goals scored at home (only eight until the 30th matchday) followed so that the 4–2 over Greuther Fürth at the 31st matchday which secured Arminia&#x27;s staying up was only Arminia&#x27;s third win at home. That season&#x27;s highlights probably were the draws against all three top teams away. In the league table Arminia never went deeper than rank 14 and finished 12th.

After the season, the coach Norbert Meier was bought by SV Darmstadt 98. A difficult 2016–17 season with two manager sackings followed. Arminia found themselves among the lowest four teams in the league table from the fourth matchday onwards, mostly on the 16th or 17th rank. On the other hand, Arminia reached the quarter-final in the DFB-Pokal. They avoided relegation as they finished in 15th after a 6–0 win over promotion candidate Eintracht Braunschweig and a 1–1 against Dynamo Dresden at the last two matchdays.

The 2017–18 season turned out easier. Having gathered 10 points out of the first four matches, Arminia hardly ever left the upper half of the league table (only at the 19th matchday: rank 10) and finished on the 4th rank – though in that season&#x27;s very close league table this never meant much. In that season, Arminia also made a big step in lowering its debts through an alliance of sponsors and Fabian Klos replaced Ernst Kuster as the club&#x27;s all-time top scorer.

In November 2018, Arminia were practically free of debt but had to sell its stadium. The team faced a more difficult situation when December started: Having gained less than one point per match on average, only the weakness of the competing relegation candidates kept them up and they were already out of the DFB-Pokal after a 0–3 defeat at home against MSV Duisburg – another relegation candidate – in the second round. Thus, the popular coach Jeff Saibene was replaced by Uwe Neuhaus, who managed Arminia back into mid table within four matchdays and into 7th place by the last matchday.
The 2019–20 season would turn out even better. When Arminia had climbed on the 3rd rank of the league table after a 2–0 victory away against Hannover 96 – who were originally regarded as a promotion candidate – at the 6th matchday, hardly anyone guessed they would stay in the promotion area of the league table for the rest of the season. They had just reached the second rank of the league table when they met FC Schalke 04 in the 2nd round of the DFB-Pokal on 29 October. In spite of Schalke clearly dominating the match in the first 70 minutes, Arminia thrilled the supporters in the last 20 minutes by scoring two goals and only closely missing extra time. They finished the 15th matchday on 1 December on the first rank of the league table where they would stay for the rest of the season in spite of competing with Hamburger SV and VfB Stuttgart who were originally estimated as main promotion candidates. After Arminia&#x27;s 1–1 draw in Stuttgart on 9 March 2020 (25th matchday) the season was interrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even this interruption did not affect them: they finished the season with 68 points – 10 points more than VfB Stuttgart who finished 2nd.

===Bundesliga return and double relegation (2020–present)===
In the 2020–21 season, they were the team with the lowest budget in the Bundesliga. After a defeat in the first round of the DFB-Pokal they had a quite promising start in the Bundesliga season, but from the 4th matchday onwards they could be found among the last five teams in the league table, from the 6th matchday onwards amongst the last four teams. In March, the popular manager Uwe Neuhaus was replaced by Frank Kramer. A 2–0 win over VfB Stuttgart on the final matchday secured their spot in the 2021–22 Bundesliga.

That season turned out even more difficult. At the end of October, they were in danger of losing touch with the 16th rank. They started November with a 1–0 win away over VfB Stuttgart, their first win in the whole Bundesliga season. That match appeared to have stabilized Arminia&#x27;s performance. In February they climbed up to 14th after a 1–0 win over 1. FC Union Berlin. However, this would be their last win of the season. They ended in 17th place and were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. The following season, Arminia finished in 16th place, and lost the relegation playoff to Wehen Wiesbaden, thus suffering the indignity of suffering back-to-back relegations. In their fourth season in the 3. Liga, team captain Fabian Klos announced his retirement from professional football, thus also ending his 13-year history with the club.

==Colours and crest==

Arminia took the club colours blue, white and black upon their foundation in 1905. The colours have not changed, though the current club colours are black, white and blue. Despite this, Arminia played their first match in an orange kit. Arminia&#x27;s home kit was blue for most of the time, while their shorts and socks were white. The team that won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970 wore a blue shirt with thick white stripes. The away kit was mostly all white, while green shirts were worn in the 1990s.

The crest consists of a flag with the club&#x27;s colours black, white and blue from left to right. The white part of the flag includes the letter A for Arminia. The flag is surrounded by a laurel wreath.

Arminia played their first home matches at the &quot;Kesselbrink&quot; in downtown Bielefeld. They moved to a new ground at the &quot;Kaiserstraße&quot; (today: &quot;August-Bebel-Straße&quot;) in 1907, and to the &quot;Pottenau&quot; in 1910. In 1926, Arminia leased a ground from a farmer named Lohmann. The ground did not look like a football pitch. The club member Heinrich Pahl said that the area looks like an Alm (German for &quot;alpine grassland&quot;). The stadium was known as the Alm. Arminia played its first match against Victoria Hamburg on 1 May 1926. The first grandstands were constructed in 1954. When Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970, the Alm underwent a general development. A main stand with seats was built and the northern and eastern stands were enlarged. The Alm had a capacity of 30,000 and floodlights were installed. In 1978, a roof was added to the main stands and the other stands were enlarged again. The stadium had a capacity of 35,000 then.

When Arminia was relegated to the Oberliga in 1988, the northern and the southern stand were torn down because both stands did not match the new safety regulations. The eastern stand was also made smaller and a roof was added. The capacity was reduced to about 15,000. After Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1996, the main and northern stands were demolished and completely rebuilt. The same happened to the south stand in 1999. In 2004, Arminia signed a sponsorship deal with Schüco and the stadium was named &quot;SchücoArena&quot;. The latest redevelopment saw the Eastern Stand being rebuilt in 2008.

The Bielefelder Alm has a capacity of 27,300, including 20,381 seats. Bielefelder Alm was a candidate to host matches of the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

==Supporters==
Arminia have a large number of loyal supporters. Even in 2011–12, Arminia had an average attendance of 8,930, which was the highest in the 3. Liga. In 2014–15, Arminia had an average attendance of 14,540, which was the second highest in that 3. Liga season. The numbers also show the risen popularity of the 3. Liga. Arminia&#x27;s matches during the 2013–14 2. Bundesliga were attended by 16,890 on average. These numbers only count league matches. Arminia&#x27;s matches in the 2014–15 DFB-Pokal were attended by 21,763 on average. The core of the fans can be found on the terraces of the Southern Stand.

Arminia&#x27;s fans come primarily from the Ostwestfalen-Lippe region with a catchment area of about 100 kilometers around Bielefeld. There are around 140 fanclubs, mostly from Ostwestfalen-Lippe. However, there are fanclubs in Berlin, Stuttgart, London, Birmingham, Taunton, Austria and the Netherlands.
There is a traditional rivalry with SC Preußen Münster. The match against them in March 2012, which was the first one taking place in Bielefeld after nearly 20 years, was attended by 21,203 spectators. No other match in the 3. Liga had such a high attendance. One year later, the stadium was nearly sold out in that derby. An earlier rival was VfB 03 Bielefeld from the east of Bielefeld, but the rivalry lessened, and, nowadays, friendly matches between Arminia and VfB Fichte Bielefeld, as the club nowadays is called, take place every year. Another rival is VfL Bochum, especially since the late 90s, and there were &quot;fashion rivalries&quot; with other clubs from the Ruhr, because that area also belongs to Westphalia. Many SC Paderborn 07 supporters consider Arminia as their main rival, but Arminia fans generally do not feel the same about them. Also the matches against VfL Osnabrück are a small derby (somehow oscillating between friendship and rivalry). There are friendly relations to the supporters of the Hamburger SV, with both clubs sharing the same colours (black, white and blue), resulting in the chant &quot;Schwarz, weiß, blau – Arminia und der HSV&quot; (&quot;Black, white, blue – Arminia and HSV&quot;) among supporters of both clubs. For many fans this friendship also involves friendly ties to Hannover 96, whose fans share a friendship with Hamburg as well. All three clubs are sometimes dubbed the &quot;Nordallianz&quot; (&quot;Northern Alliance&quot;), despite the fact that Bielefeld (other than Hamburg and Hannover) is not located in what is considered Northern Germany.

The team&#x27;s games are regularly broadcast by local radio station &quot;Radio Bielefeld&quot; and commentator Ulrich Zwetz.

==100 year team==
To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the club&#x27;s formation, a fan poll was taken to determine the club&#x27;s greatest starting XI, as well as seven substitutes and a manager. The following players were chosen:

==Arminia players in national teams==
The player who has won the most international caps while at the club (from 1997 to 2000) is Karim Bagheri with 28 for Iran. He and his team-mate Ali Daei were important Iranian players in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. They are the only footballers having taken part in a World Cup&#x27;s final tournament while playing for Arminia. Other remarkable Arminia players who represented foreign countries while at the club are Pasi Rautiainen, Artur Wichniarek, Markus Weissenberger, Fatmir Vata, Isaac Boakye, Delron Buckley, Sibusiso Zuma, Rowen Fernández, Christopher Katongo, Jonas Kamper, Ritsu Dōan and Alessandro Schöpf.

Four players were capped by Germany during their time with Arminia: Walter Claus-Oehler in 1923, Stefan Kuntz in 1996, Ronald Maul in 1999 and Patrick Owomoyela in 2004 and 2005. He played six matches for Germany in this time and thus holds the record. Some of the most famous former Arminia players played for their national teams only between their times with Arminia (Uli Stein and Jörg Böhme) or after their years with Arminia (Dieter Burdenski, Thomas Helmer, Arne Friedrich, Heiko Westermann and Jonathan Clauss).

<doc id="1145232" wikidata="Q718965" url="?curid=1145232" title="Hinata Hyuga">
<text>is a fictional character in the anime and manga &quot;Naruto&quot;, created by Masashi Kishimoto. Hinata is a beautiful 
kunoichi and the former heiress of the Hyūga clan from the fictional village of Konoha. She is also a member of Team 8, which consists of herself, Kiba Inuzuka with his ninja dog — Akamaru, Shino Aburame, and team leader Kurenai Yuhi. At the start of the series, Hinata has strong admiration toward the main protagonist — Naruto Uzumaki, which eventually turns into love as the story progresses. Hinata has appeared several times in the series&#x27; feature films, most notably &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2014), which revolves around her relationship with Naruto. She has also been present in other media related to the franchise, including video games, original video animations, and the manga and anime sequel &quot;&quot; (2016), in which she has become the mother of Naruto’s three children and is now named .

In the making of the series, Kishimoto had decided Hinata would marry Naruto; however, the plot regarding their romance was conceived by screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka. Hinata&#x27;s design has been modified by Kishimoto throughout the franchise&#x27;s story in order to fit the character&#x27;s growth. She is voiced by Nana Mizuki in the original animated series and Stephanie Sheh in the English adaptations. Critical reception to the character has been mostly positive due to her actions in the series and her bigger role in &quot;The Last&quot; — her interactions with Naruto and her engagement in a conflict with the film&#x27;s villain have been praised. Hinata has also been popular with the &quot;Naruto&quot; reader base, placing high in some polls. Merchandise based on Hinata have been released, including action figures, key chains and figurines and plushies

==Creation and conception==

In creating Hinata Hyuga, Masashi Kishimoto originally designed a sketch which was shown to one of his assistants. In this sketch, Hinata was not a ninja and instead wore a fashion dress. Kishimoto remarked he had created this design for fun, emphasizing that he wanted Hinata to have a different personality. Nonetheless, the final design changed drastically, with Hinata becoming a ninja and a modern girl at the same time.

In 2017, Kishimoto said in an interview that he had decided on Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata getting married from the early stages of the manga. He felt that their relationship was meant to be as Hinata had been supportive of Naruto since the beginning, even before Iruka Umino; however, this angered his wife, who wanted Naruto to end up with Sakura Haruno instead. As the character&#x27;s popularity was increasing, Kishimoto decided that Hinata would have a bigger role in the final arc. As a result, he conceived the idea of killing Hinata&#x27;s cousin, Neji Hyuga, in order for her to offer support to Naruto while being protected by Neji before his death. Animator Chengxi Huang behind multiple &quot;Naruto&quot; series took a liking to this couple ever since he started working in &quot;Naruto Shippuden&quot;, often aiming to draw scenes of the two and most notably a scene from the final arc when Hinata slaps Naruto to calm him following the death of Neji Hyuga. In the making of the film, he thanked Kishimoto for accepting to do &quot;The Last&quot; where the couple was explored furthermore. He later created a video which showed a nude Hinata and Naruto in bed together, posted to his work Instagram, but removed it after the video received fan backlash for being inappropriate for the demographic.

In the film &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2014), Hinata knits a red scarf for Naruto. This was based on how Kishimoto&#x27;s wife had actually once done for him, which brought laughs to the staff while developing the film. Screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka said he wanted to depict a love triangle between Naruto, Hinata, and Toneri Otsutsuki in &quot;The Last&quot;. Hinata&#x27;s character was also developed in the film, with Kyozuka saying that she had to put aside her feelings for Naruto to accept Toneri&#x27;s proposal so that she could rescue Hanabi Hyuga, her sister. Kishimoto felt embarrassment when it came to the romance in the film, stating that he was not sure if he would be able to look at the scene depicting Naruto and Hinata&#x27;s kiss. Nevertheless, he felt a combination of satisfaction and sadness due to the couple&#x27;s development, stating that he considered them his children.

For the series&#x27; Part II, Hinata was designed to look like a woman who is beautiful but avoids using make-up and is more focused on fighting. Hinata&#x27;s appearance was altered when she became a young adult. The clothing she wore varied from girlish clothing to clothing that brought about an adult atmosphere. The character viewed being able to move her feet as important, so she wore clothes with low heels. To make her more like an adult woman, Kishimoto designed her with a strong image in mind. However, drawing Hinata with a pretty and feminine face was difficult, so he largely left the task to Tetsuya Nishio, who was in charge of aiding the author with the character designs. Also, he conceptualized her with a fixed design behind her waist so that her pouch would not get in the way. Different from always being embarrassed in front of Naruto, Hinata wore a languorous expression, which is characteristic of a woman that is deeply in love.

For the film &quot;&quot; (2015) and the following projects, Hinata was further redesigned. Kishimoto made her hair shorter since it had become a hindrance for her due to her interactions with her growing children. Her clothes were created in order to fit her growth as a mature woman and mother while still retaining the fashion she likes.

===Voice actresses===

Nana Mizuki, Hinata&#x27;s Japanese voice actress, was surprised by the focus her character received. After seeing Hinata as a young adult, Mizuki commented that she was amazed by how womanly and mature Hinata had become. She expressed similar feelings regarding Hinata&#x27;s interactions with Naruto&#x27;s young adult self. The character&#x27;s attributes such as her personality and her unwillingness to give up regardless of the situation were what made Mizuki like Hinata. Her favorite scene in the film was Naruto&#x27;s love confession to Hinata. Mizuki was happy for what this meant to her character, but she did not enjoy the moment when Hinata took Toneri&#x27;s side.

Stephanie Sheh, Hinata&#x27;s English voice actress, originally auditioned for both Hinata and Sakura Haruno. She felt pleasure when she received Hinata&#x27;s role as she found her relatable due to her self-esteem issues. She stated that she wanted her character to end up with Naruto due to her feelings for him.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Naruto&quot;===
Hinata, the eldest of Hiashi Hyuga&#x27;s two children, is raised as the heiress to Hyuga clan&#x27;s main household due to Hiashi being the elder between him and his twin brother, Hizashi, and thereby making Hiashi head of the clan while Hizashi is demoted to the Branch House whose only purpose is to serve the upper branch. Hinata is nearly kidnapped at a young age, though saved by her father; this serves as the catalyst of the Hyuga Affair, which ends with Hizashi willingly taking the place of Hiashi to compensate for the death of the head ninja who tried to kidnap Hinata so that a breach in the treaty between the Hyuga clan&#x27;s village of Konohagakure and Kumogakure is prevented. Growing up, Hinata is trained by Hiashi, but he begins to have doubts about her ability to lead the clan after seeing her struggles during their sessions. As a result, he apparently disowns her, having her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, as the heiress. Hinata also meets Naruto Uzumaki during her youth, developing an interest in him after he defends her while she is being bullied because of her eyes. That event and Naruto&#x27;s refusal to give up against adversity inspire Hinata to become a stronger person. However, Hinata&#x27;s admiration for Naruto gradually turns into romantic feelings.

Hinata is introduced in Part I of the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga during the Chunin Exams, a series of tests that are meant to upgrade her status as a rookie, along with her teammates — Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame. She reaches the third examination, where she is forced to fight her cousin, Neji Hyuga. Despite her fears, Naruto encourages her to battle him. She is nearly killed in combat, and Naruto decides to avenge her. At the end of Part I, after Naruto leaves to be trained by Jiraiya, Hinata vows to become a stronger person. In Part II, two-and-a-half years after the events of Part I, Hinata has been promoted to Chunin and reunites with Naruto, fainting at seeing him for the first time in years. Hinata and her team aid Team Kakashi on a collaborative mission to find both Naruto&#x27;s rival and former teammate Sasuke Uchiha and his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, though the mission is ultimately a failure. After the Akatsuki terrorist leader, Pain, attacks Konohagakure and overwhelms Naruto in combat, Hinata attempts to save the latter while finally admitting her feelings for him. Though, impaled by Pain as means to force Naruto to see the world from his perspective, Hinata survives and her injuries are healed soon afterward by Sakura Haruno. When the Fourth Great Ninja War begins, Hinata is placed in the same division as Neji, and she joins Naruto in the battle against the Ten-Tails after her cousin sacrifices himself to protect them. She manages to defeat the clone of the Ten-Tails but later gets caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi, imagining a relationship with Naruto before being released. After Naruto is able to defeat and reform Sasuke, Hinata and everyone else are released from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. She later attends Neji&#x27;s funeral alongside Naruto and the rest of the Konohagakure shinobi. In the following years, Hinata and Naruto marry and have two children, a son named Boruto Uzumaki, and a daughter named Himawari Uzumaki.

===In &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;===
The events of &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; take place two years after the Fourth Great Ninja War in the series&#x27; Part II. At the age of 19, Hinata hopes to give Naruto a red scarf she knitted herself as a gift of love (which is reminiscent of the scarf he wore when they met as children, which was torn apart by bullies he was defending her from). But she becomes doubtful he&#x27;ll accept it when he receives a wide variety of gifts from other women due to his newfound popularity and begins wearing a blue scarf he recently found. Soon after this, Toneri Otsutsuki infiltrates Konohagakure and kidnaps Hinata&#x27;s sister, Hanabi, in order to use her as his new eyes. Hinata joins Team Kakashi and Shikamaru Nara on the mission to save her sister. 

During their journey through the abandoned Shinobi village of the Otsutsuki Clan, Naruto returns Hinata&#x27;s feelings for him after he is caught in a genjutsu and relives some of her memories. Despite this, Hinata has been contacted by the spirit of her ancestor, Hamura Otsutsuki, to aid him as the &quot;Byakugan Princess&quot;; thus, she allows herself to be captured by Toneri under his belief that they will be getting married. In truth, it is so that she can destroy the . However, Toneri discovers the deception and mind-controls Hinata after destroying the scarf she originally created for Naruto. Naruto&#x27;s team finally catches up, and a massive attack on Toneri&#x27;s palace begins. The team splits, with Naruto disrupting the wedding ceremony just as Toneri was about to kiss Hinata, while the others secure Hanabi. Hinata carries out Hamura&#x27;s will by helping Naruto destroy the Tenseigan and stop Toneri. 

In spite of this, Toneri&#x27;s Tenseigan chakra cloak grants him the power to slice the moon in half, placing Hinata in a giant bird cage. Naruto enters Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, and a huge duel ensues. Near the end, Naruto grasps the last remaining shred of Hinata&#x27;s scarf and channels his chakra to deliver a punch strong enough to pin Toneri against the wall and depower him, stopping the moon from falling. Hinata takes Hanabi&#x27;s eyes back from Toneri and returns them to her sister. Soon after, Hinata and Naruto reaffirm their mutual love and kiss for first time as they enter into a relationship that leads to their marriage and the start of their family.

===In &quot;Boruto&quot;===
In &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Hinata tries to make the best of Himawari&#x27;s birthday by planning a party in Naruto&#x27;s absence due to his new duties as Hokage. She then watches Boruto while he competes in the Chunin Exams, being approached by Naruto to use her Byakugan to confirm his suspicions that their son is cheating by using a particular ninja tool. After Momoshiki Otsutsuki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki attack and subsequently kidnap Naruto, Hinata tries to rescue him by chasing after them, only to be swept aside and wounded; she is then healed by Sakura. While Hinata is against Boruto joining Sasuke&#x27;s rescue team, she eventually gives in. With Naruto then rescued, Hinata tends to the damage of Boruto&#x27;s jacket before he declines.

===In other media===
Besides &quot; The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; and &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Hinata appears in five other &quot;Naruto&quot; feature films; in &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie&quot; (2007), she and Shino briefly cross paths with Team 7; in &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds&quot; (2008), Hinata, Naruto and Sakura are on a mission to escort Amaru and Shinno to their respective villages, with Hinata incorrectly confirming the death of Amaru and being captured along with the villagers, though later being freed by Amaru; in &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire&quot; (2009), she goes in search of Naruto and Sakura who are themselves looking for Kakashi Hatake, and she joins Neji in attacking the flying beast fusion of Ni, Ichi and San, afterward combining their attacks to destroy it; in &quot;Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison&quot; (2011), Hinata works in a team to bring Naruto back from the Blood Prison; in &quot;Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2012), taking place prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, Hinata fights off an attack from the Akatsuki while an alternate version of her, who wears less clothing and has more confidence and assertiveness, appears in the Genjutsu World created by Obito Uchiha, who has used the tailed beasts in his possession. A light novel titled &quot;Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze&quot; (2015), written by Tomohito Ōsaki and illustrated by Kishimoto, details a date between Hinata and Naruto, the pair trying to save Sakura after her kidnapping by Kido Tsumiki but being too late to rescue her as Sakura has already saved herself.

==Reception==

Hinata is a popular character among &quot;Naruto&quot; fans, ranking tenth in the first annual character popularity poll, sixth in both the second and third, 12th in the fourth, ninth in the fifth, 13th in the sixth, and tenth in the seventh. Amy McNulty of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; complimented the voice work of Stephanie Sheh for &quot;simultaneously conveying the character&#x27;s shyness, anxiety and determination&quot;. Hinata merchandise has been released, including figurines. In a poll from 2021, Hinata was voted as the fourth most popular character in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;. In 2023, in the first global poll, Hinata was found to be the franchise&#x27;s tenth most popular character overall, and the second most popular female character behind Sakura Haruno.

Reviewing one of the series&#x27; early story arcs, Carl Kimlinger of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; said that her fight stimulated her &quot;determination to change&quot; because of her weak personality. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Charles White enjoyed Hinata&#x27;s character arc in the first anime series, praising how she fought alone in order to save Naruto from the antagonist Jiga. During the series&#x27; final arc, Chris Beveridge of &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; liked the way Hinata supported Naruto and helped him to keep fighting against their enemies alongside her. Critic Yukari Fujimoto stated that Hinata, along with other female characters, prioritized love, treating it as more important than excelling as a ninja. After seeing her in the series&#x27; Part II for the first time, Jason Thompson enjoyed Hinata&#x27;s design and expected that she and Naruto would form a couple in the future. For the finale, Ramsey Isler of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that while Hinata and Naruto ending up together was not a surprise, it nonetheless disappointed some fans who wanted Naruto to start a relationship with Sakura Haruno.

Critical reception to the development of Naruto and Hinata&#x27;s relationship in &quot;The Last&quot; was generally positive. Charles Solomon of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; regarded their relation in the film as an &quot;awkward romance&quot;, while &quot;Japanator.com&quot; wrote that Hinata&#x27;s struggles with romance were part of the film&#x27;s favorable aspects. McNulty said that, while the romance might have come off as awkward at first, it became much more appealing to the viewers as the film went on. Brendan Ha of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; felt that while many readers had known Hinata&#x27;s feelings for Naruto ever since her early appearances in the series, Naruto&#x27;s feelings for her had never been seen and thus &quot;The Last&quot; helped to show them. Ha praised the way Hinata tried to confess her love to Naruto, making the film &quot;touching&quot;. Beveridge found the two characters&#x27; development appealing, but he also stated that he wished the film had been condensed in order to focus on the main couple only. &quot;UK Anime Network&quot; writer Dan Rhodes agreed with Beveridge, saying the main storyline&#x27;s focus was Hinata and Naruto&#x27;s relationship rather than the appearance of the film&#x27;s villain, whom he considered forgettable. Chris Homer, another &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; writer, felt that &quot;Naruto&quot; fans had wanted to see this particular pair together for over fifteen years and stated the film &quot;delivers&quot;; he also praised the relationship between Hinata and Sakura as the latter tried to help Hinata confess her love to Naruto. David West of &quot;Neo&quot; said that Hinata and Naruto&#x27;s relationship was well executed, and he praised the inclusion of previous events from the series in which the two characters were together. He also enjoyed Hinata&#x27;s role in the film and what happened between her and the antagonist.

In March 2018, Chinese animator Chengxi Huang posted a video of Naruto and Hinata embracing each other naked in bed, to his public work Instagram. The video received fan backlash for being inappropriate for the demographic. Huang&#x27;s apology stated that the animation was simply practice, and that he wanted to portray the everyday life of a married couple but still deleted the video in response.

<text>Cobdenism is an economic ideology (and the associated popular movement) which perceives international free trade and a non-interventionist foreign policy as the key requirements for prosperity and world peace. It is named after the British statesman and economist Richard Cobden and had its heyday of political influence in the British Empire during the mid-19th century, amidst and after the endeavour to abolish the Corn Laws.

Based on Adam Smith&#x27;s assertion that full employment and economic growth require access to foreign markets, Cobden perceived the expansion of foreign trade as the main means of increasing global prosperity and emphasized the importance of the international division of labour for economic progress. Akin to his ideal of Britain as an industrial society of small cooperating property owners, he believed in an international order of small, independent nations attaining shared prosperity through international trade. As Cobden saw Britain&#x27;s involvement in empire as an unwelcome distraction of domestic investment into its industrial capacity, his writings became influential in anti-imperialist circles, being picked up by e.g. John A. Hobson. Moreover, it influenced the economic thinking of John Maynard Keynes, who was a staunch adherent of Richard Cobden&#x27;s theories prior to the First World War, after which he abandoned Cobdenism in favor of &quot;insular capitalism&quot;.

Rarely used today and already in decline by the end of the 19th century, Cobdenism was revived by some academics during the 1980s to support the liberalization of the British economy.

<text>Jiraiya (自来也 or 児雷也, literally &quot;Young Thunder&quot;), originally known as Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki (尾形周馬寛行), is the toad-riding protagonist of the Japanese folk tale &quot;Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari&quot; (報仇奇談自来也説話, &quot;The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya&quot;). The tale was originally a Yomihon that was published in 1806–1807, and was adapted into a serialized novel that was written by different authors and published in 43 installments from 1839 to 1868; one of its illustrators was woodblock artist Kunisada. Kawatake Mokuami then wrote a kabuki drama based on the first ten parts of the novel, which premiered in Edo in 1852, starring Ichikawa Danjūrō VIII in the leading role. Since then the story has been adapted into several films, video games, manga, and has also influenced various other works.

== Classic tale – &quot;Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari&quot; ==
&quot;Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari&quot; (報仇奇談自来也説話)  is considered the first novel or Yomihon to be adapted into a kabuki play, the novel was written by Kanwatei Onitake (感和亭鬼武) and was published between 1806 and 1807. The story was later adapted many more times with variations in the story.

=== Part 1: (books 1–5) ===
The tale of Jiraiya starts with a poor, masterless samurai named Isami Gentaro, who&#x27;s wrongfully jailed because he could not afford the rent for his farm. His family manages to get the money to pay his bail so Isami&#x27;s father, Kirakusai, travels alongside his grandson, Tomokichi, to pay Isami&#x27;s bail. However, on the way to free Isami, Kirakusai is attacked and killed by Master Rokuyaon Gun who kidnaps the two-year-old Tomokichi and abandons him in a valley. During this time, a masterless samurai of the Miyoshi House, Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, better known as &quot;Jiraiya&quot;, happens upon the young Tomokichi and decides to raise him as his son.

Gentaro is later released with the help of other villagers and becomes a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa after proving his courage as a samurai at the same time as Master Gun. Gentaro and Master Gun then begin working together to capture Jiraiya as he is a wanted criminal. Fortunately, though caught, Jiraiya manages to scheme his way out of jail. Gentaro eventually meets his wife, Soe (who now goes by &quot;Seino&quot;), and they discuss the former&#x27;s hatred for whoever killed his father and son, both unaware the latter is alive. Master Gun eavesdrops on this conversation and decides to steal their Amulet of Protection, also known as the &quot;Seitensō&quot; (西天草), and proceeds to kill both Gentaro and Soe. Tomokichi—whilst engaged in a duel with Master Gun for Midori, the stepdaughter of Gentaro—learns that it was he who murdered his family. While this allows Tomokichi a chance to exact his revenge, he is unable to take it as Master Gun uses the Amulet of Protection to escape.

Master Gun is chased to Mt. Miyoko by Tomokichi and, upon reaching the mountain, is accosted by the spirits of the dead until he arrives to a grotto where the Immortal Toad Ascetic lives. They converse, and the immortal sees all of Master Guns&#x27; sins and even tells him that, since there are dead souls haunting him, he must be a murderer and that he&#x27;ll die from his sins. Terrified, Master Gun begs the immortal to save him, to which he agrees but saying he will only help him once. The immortal then uses his magic arts to send Master Gun down the mountain before warning him if he tells anyone of this encounter he will die. However, later that night, after getting drunk with one of Jiraiya&#x27;s followers, Master Gun tells him of the events at Mt. Miyoko. The morning after Master Gun leaves, Jiraiya goes to Mt. Miyoko to visit the Immortal. The Toad Ascetic then appears in front of Jiraiya and tells him that, even though he is a bandit who committed innumerable sins, he&#x27;ll teach him one magic art as he admires Jiraiya&#x27;s loyalty. While Master Gun and Jiraiya are visiting the immortal, Tomokichi sets out to find them and, upon finally locating Jiraiya, recounts to his stepfather of what has happened to his family. Jiraiya vows to assist Tomokichi in his revenge and will be there to help when he is needed, sending his troops to steal the Seitenso from Master Gun so as to lure him out in order to kill him.

After luring Master Gun to a place called Kagamigaura, Tomokichi and Master Gun then engage in battle. While Tomokichi almost fails, he is able to turn the tide thanks to Jiraiya&#x27;s encouragement, announces he&#x27;ll avenge his grandfather and parents, and finally cuts off Master Guns&#x27; head, ending part one and the first revenge story.

=== Part 2: (books 5–10) ===
The second part opens up with the immortal on Mt. Miyoko appearing to Jiraiya in his dreams asking for his assistance in return for teaching him more magic arts. Jiraiya sets off towards the mountain to save his master and, when he arrives, sees a monstrous snake fighting his master, who&#x27;s taken on the form of a giant toad. Jiraiya manages to kill the snake and is rewarded by the immortal with more magic arts, which he then uses to rob a wealthy man right after learning them. Since Jiraiya is wanted by the government, he became a pirate and started plundering commercial ships, until one night at sea the ghost of his former lord, Miyoshi Nagashige asks him to take revenge on the Ishido family, more specifically Ishido Haruchika. Jiraiya agrees and he soon after saves a vassal of Ishido named Agawa Uneo, and his companion Nagisa, the younger sister of another vassal named Madeno Hamanosuke, to which he tosses Agawa Uneo into the sea and takes Nagisa hostage. Agawa Uneo is then saved by a former member of his group and begins to pursue Jiraiya immediately after recovering. During this time, Madeno Hamanosuke goes to Mt. Kinki to pray to Benzaiten, a god related to snakes, for the safety of his lord. He is answered by a goddess who appears before him and gives him the Stone Conch, otherwise known as the &quot;Ishihara&quot; (石螺), which holds the power to negate magic arts and repel evil.

Meanwhile, Tomokichi has become a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa after taking revenge on Master Gun and is ordered to take back the Amulet of Protection from Jiraiya, to which he sets off in search of his adoptive father. After finding Jiraiya, Tomokichi asks him to return the Amulet of Protection to which the former agrees, but only after the next six months as he needs it to complete his revenge. In order to keep this meeting a secret, Jiraiya summons a powerful tsunami to kill all of Tomokichi&#x27;s troops despite the latter&#x27;s pleads for mercy to his men. After all is said and done, Jiraiya invites Tomokichi to go with him on his revenge quest so that he would not be punished.

Jiraiya then begins his plan, first by robbing betrothal gifts for Ishido Haruchika&#x27;s daughter, Tamahitohime, which leads to the death of Nagisa. After sneaking into the Nitsuki House, Jiraiya summons a tsunami to kill all of the servants in order for his troops to pose as them and sneak into the Ishido residence. Jiraiya then finds a mountain hermit who was going to treat one of Ishido Haruchika&#x27;s sick daughters and kills him, he then pretends to be the mountain hermit in order to sneak into the Ishido House. After sneaking into Ishido Haruchikas&#x27;s room, Jiraiya then cuts off his head.

Afterwards, Jiraiya calls on Tomokichi to return the Amulet of Protection as promised. However, Madeno Hamanosuke shows up and announces the head of the man Jiraiya cut off actually belonged to Agawa Uneo and all of his troops were captured because a member of the Jiraiya&#x27;s group, Asazuma was a vassal of Ishido and warned the Ishido house of his plan. Jiraiya tries to use his magic arts to defeat Madeno Hamanosuke, however, Madeno uses the Stone Conch that was given to him by Benzaiten to negate Jiraiya&#x27;s magic arts. Jiraiya finally realizes that his death is at hand as he lived a sinful life and this is his justice so, before anyone can kill him, he commits suicide and turns to stone.

== English translation – Jiraiya, or the Magic Frog ==

=== Plot ===
A popular version of the story was translated by William Elliot Griffis. The story starts with Jiraiya&#x27;s father, who was a castle lord, but was killed during one of many civil wars. After he is killed, young Jiraiya is hidden by a retainer and is able to escape, but they are attacked by a band of robbers and the retainer is killed after resisting. Jiraiya goes to a place called Echigo where he spent the rest of his childhood. Jiraiya now led a wandering life in several provinces but wished to restore his family name. His swordsmanship talent and exceptional bravery allowed Jiraiya to soon become a chief of his own band of robbers, where he would sneak in disguise to places he robbed in order to learn where the treasure was stored. He would then come back and steal said treasure later.

One day, Jiraiya heard of an old man who lived in Shinano and so he started off to rob him. The land was a place full of mountains and was full of snow in the winter. During the journey, he was beset by a great snowstorm and he took refuge in a small house that he happened upon, inside was a beautiful woman who treated him with great kindness. This did not change Jiraiya&#x27;s nature as a robber though and after midnight he went to kill her with his sword while she was reading. However, in a flash, her body changed to a very old man who grabbed the heavy steel blade and easily broke it into pieces. He then announces his name as Senso Dojin, and that he is a giant frog that has lived on the mountain for hundreds of years. He pardons Jiraiya after telling him he could kill him easily and then teaches him magic arts. Jiraiya stayed with Senso Dojin for several weeks learning the magic arts of the mountain sprites in order to control the weather as well as to control frogs and change their shape and size at will. After Senso teaches him he forbids him from robbing or injuring the poor and helpless and to instead take from those who use and acquire money dishonestly and to help the needy and suffering. He then turns into a giant frog and hops away.

After this Jiraiya sets out on his journey to help the poor and needy by helping a poor farmer whose crops failed and he could not pay his rent or loan on time. As well whenever a miser was robbed they would say that the young thunder had struck, as Jiraiya was very popular with the poor people of the time.

During this time when Jiraiya was helping the poor and needy, a young maiden named Tsunade also lived in the same province of Kiushiu. She was a model daughter and was always obedient and kind. One day during her trip into the mountains for firewood she met a very old man who approached her and told her he had lived in the mountains for hundreds of years and that his body was really that of a snail. He then offers to teach Tsunade the powers of magic he possesses. She gladly accepted and began training daily with the old man. Once she had mastered the magic, she was advised to use her powers to defend the poor and destroy wicked robbers, and to join her powers with Jiraiya in the form of marriage. The old man then turns into a snail and crawls away. Tsunade then remarks that she and Jiraiya with the combination of slug magic and frog magic would be able to destroy a robber named Orochimaru, who was the son of a serpent. Tsunade and Jiraiya eventually met and were married soon after.

Soon after Jiraiya and Tsunade were married war broke out in Japan between the Tsukikage and the Inukage. In the war, the Tsukikage sought out the help of Jiraiya and Tsunade who agreed to help them with the war, while the other clan the Inukage sought the help of Orochimaru otherwise known as Dragon-coil. Orochimaru was known as a very wicked robber whose father was a man and mother was a serpent that lived at the bottom of lake Takura, he was skilled in the magic of the serpent and would spew venom on the strongest of warriors to destroy them.

During a respite between the conflicts, Jiraiya and Tsunade were resting in a monastery. In the monastery, there was also a princess named Tagoto that had fled from Orochimaru as he wanted her to be his bride. She hated Orochimaru and did not want to marry him, however, when Orochimaru upon hearing that Tagoto and Jiraiya were in the same monastery, immediately made his way to the monastery. He then kidnapped the princess Tagoto and poured poisonous venom onto the sleeping Jiraiya and Tsunade. After they are poisoned one of Jiraiya&#x27;s pages, Rikimatsu, volunteers to go to India to retrieve the only antidote to cure Jiraiya and Tsunade. Rikimatsu then uses the magic he learned from the Tengus of the mountains he flies to India and back in one day and one night to deliver the antidote. After Jiraiya and his wife recovered the war broke out again, and in a great battle Orochimaru was killed and Tagoto was rescued. Jiraiya was rewarded by being made a daimyo of Idzu.

At this point, Jiraiya had grown tired of war and the hardships that an active life brought, and he was glad to settle down to a peaceful life in Idzu. He spent the remainder of his day in peace and tranquility among his children and his grandchildren.

<doc id="1145259" wikidata="Q30334" url="?curid=1145259" title="Shikamaru Nara">
<text>is a fictional character in the manga and anime franchise, &quot;Naruto&quot;, created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the manga, Shikamaru is a shinobi affiliated with the village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a member of Team 10, a group of ninja consisting of himself, Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and team leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character, unwilling to apply his prodigious intelligence; Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature. Outside the &quot;Naruto&quot; anime and manga, Shikamaru has appeared in several other media in the franchise, including video games, original video animations, and six feature films.

Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Shikamaru&#x27;s character. Many reviewers commented on his laziness and intelligence, and noted his transformation into a leader; Anime News Network celebrated Shikamaru&#x27;s emergence in the &quot;Naruto&quot; storyline. Shikamaru has also been highly popular with the &quot;Naruto&quot; reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches.

== Creation and conception ==
Shikamaru Nara is known for being one of the smartest characters in the anime manga series Naruto. Masashi Kishimoto originally created Shikamaru in order for him to be the only winner of an early &quot;Naruto&quot; arc: the Chunin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However, recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto deciding to interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends up becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.

Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha&#x27;s intelligent but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru&#x27;s Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.

During Part II, Shikamaru&#x27;s teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, dies while battling the Akatsuki terrorist member Hidan and Shikamaru starts smoking Asuma&#x27;s cigars. Kishimoto feared that Shueisha would censor this since Shikamaru was still a teenager and the manga&#x27;s magazine was aimed at young demographic. However, these scenes were not censored.
==Appearances==

===In &quot;Naruto&quot;===
Shikamaru&#x27;s first major appearance in the series is during the Chunin Exams; held twice a year, Genin take part in them to advance their ranks. He is part of Team 10 alongside Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. He is a highly unenthusiastic person, and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort. Contrary to his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent; his teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, determined that Shikamaru&#x27;s IQ was over 200. Shikamaru&#x27;s abilities are based on the , the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent&#x27;s shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru&#x27;s movements. As the series progresses, Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways. By Part II of the series, Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow-based techniques at once and can lift his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects; for instance, he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons.

Shikamaru approaches the exams with a sense of apathy; when he battles the Sunagakure ninja Temari, he defeats her but forfeits his match to her, due to his chakra being low. Despite this loss, he is the only ninja among his peers to be promoted to the rank of Chunin, as the overseers of the exams were impressed by the insight and intelligence he demonstrated against Temari. As a Chunin, Shikamaru is appointed the leader of a team to prevent Sasuke Uchiha from defecting to the village of Otogakure. Although Shikamaru&#x27;s team manages to defeat the Otogakure ninja barring their way, Sasuke manages to escape.

In Part II of the series, Shikamaru is assigned the task of locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki. While his team manages to find their targets, the immortal Akatsuki member Hidan kills Asuma Sarutobi during the course of the battle despite Shikamaru&#x27;s best efforts. After Asuma&#x27;s funeral, Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 to avenge their mentor with the aid of Kakashi Hatake. As the others deal with Hidan&#x27;s partner Kakuzu, Shikamaru avenges Asuma by defeating Hidan and making sure the Akatsuki member&#x27;s body is never found. Following the fight, Shikamaru vows to protect Kurenai Yuhi and Asuma&#x27;s newborn daughter. He is later assigned to the Fourth Division alongside Temari and Choji. He is named a proxy general under Gaara. In the series epilogue, stating his personal desire during the series of final battles, Shikamaru becomes advisor to the Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki after marrying Temari and gaining a son in Shikadai Nara. During Part 2 of Boruto, following Naruto&#x27;s disappearance and presumed murder, for which Boruto was framed, Shikamaru serves de facto as the Eighth Hokage, without however having been officially inaugurated.

=== Appearances in other media ===

== Reception ==
Shikamaru has ranked highly in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top ten and reaching fourth place in one poll. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Shikamaru was in ninth place, behind Sasori and ahead of Hinata. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has also been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches in both his Part I and Part II appearance. NTT customers voted him as their sixteenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Shikamaru as one of his favorite characters from &quot;Naruto&quot;.

Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have commented on Shikamaru&#x27;s character. IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as &quot;the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X&quot; due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru&#x27;s emergence as &quot;an unlikely hero&quot; one of the highlights of the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru&#x27;s team were critically injured, IGN lauded the &quot;great moment&quot; in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment&#x27;s Justin Rich celebrated his &quot;sheer intellect&quot;, calling him &quot;one of the most fascinating characters in the series&quot; and &quot;one of the few truly brilliant fighters in &quot;shōnen&quot; anime&quot;. Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was &quot;one of the better fights involving the supporting players&quot;.

Javier Lugo from Manga Life found Shikamaru&#x27;s fight in the series&#x27; fourteenth volume good despite how threatening it is for him. For Part II, Park Cooper from the same site acclaimed Shikamaru&#x27;s strategy in dealing with the members from the series&#x27; antagonist, Akatsuki. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network praised how Shikamaru&#x27;s epilogue episodes helps to expand his characterization as he decides to aid Naruto when he becomes the Hokage. Reviewing the anime &quot;&quot;″s third episode, Sam Stewart from IGN enjoyed the adult Shikamaru&#x27;s characterization for how he helps his sons Shikadai but ultimately felt he was overshadowed by his wife Temari.

<doc id="1145261" wikidata="Q52852" url="?curid=1145261" title="Rock Lee">
<text>is a fictional character in the anime and manga series &quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Naruto Shippuden&quot; created by Masashi Kishimoto. At first Masashi designed Lee to symbolize human strength. In the anime and manga, Lee is a ninja affiliated with the village of Konohagakure, and is a member of Team Guy, which consists of himself, Neji Hyuga, Tenten, and Might Guy—the team&#x27;s leader. Unable to use most ninja techniques, Lee dedicates himself to using solely taijutsu, ninja techniques similar to martial arts. Lee dreams of becoming a &quot;splendid ninja&quot; despite his inabilities. Lee has appeared in several pieces of &quot;Naruto&quot; media, including the third and fourth featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and multiple video games.

Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Lee&#x27;s character. IGN compared Lee to Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher, and Anime News Network called Lee the &quot;goofiest looking character&quot; in the series. Among the &quot;Naruto&quot; reader base, Lee has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Lee&#x27;s likeness, including figurines and plush dolls.

== Creation and conception ==
In an interview in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s &quot;Naruto Anime interview Episodes 1-37&quot;, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee more than any other character in the series. When designing Lee&#x27;s appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto&#x27;s first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee&#x27;s appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto&#x27;s design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee&#x27;s popularity among fans. He intended to write more about him but the timing was never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered over the course of the series, Kishimoto tends to place him toward the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.

In an interview, Brian Donovan, the voice actor for Rock Lee in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that he likes Lee because he felt he was attempting to be a &quot;knight in shining armor but bumbling and stumbling at the same time&quot;.

== Appearances ==

=== In &quot;Naruto&quot; ===

Rock Lee is a ninja from Konohagakure part of Team Guy, a four-man cell of ninja led by Might Guy. Inspired by Lee&#x27;s determination to become stronger despite his inability to perform basic ninja techniques, Guy takes a personal interest in him, deciding to help him achieve his dream of becoming a powerful ninja by using only taijutsu that is primary hand-to-hand combat. This relationship with Guy causes Lee to acquire many of Guy&#x27;s traits. Lee believes he can surpass the natural talents of others through hard work and passion; throughout the series, he attempts to surpass Neji Hyuga, who is labeled a &quot;genius&quot;. Lee first appears in the series as a participant in the Chunin Exams, twice a year exams for ninja who wish to increase their rank. During the Chunin Exams, Lee battles Gaara, a ninja from the village of Sunagakure. In the fight, Lee opens the five of the eight chakra gates, limits on the body&#x27;s ability to use chakra, using a forbidden technique known as the Hidden Lotus, increasing his natural abilities at the cost of his health. Despite his effort, Gaara cripples Lee by crushing his left arm and leg, injuring Lee to the point that he must abandon being a ninja.

When Tsunade, a Konohagakure medical ninja, returns to lead the village as the Fifth Hokage, she offers to operate on him. Despite the procedure&#x27;s fifty percent chance of failure, Guy encourages Lee to have the operation. Ultimately, Lee undergoes the surgery, which succeeds in healing his arm and leg. Immediately after the operation, Lee follows a team of ninja led by Shikamaru Nara who attempt to stop Sasuke Uchiha from defecting from Konohagakure to the village of Otogakure. Lee battles the Otogakure ninja Kimimaro through using the fighting style in which he becomes inebriated with unpredictable attacks. When Kimimaro is on the verge of defeating Lee, Gaara intervenes, continuing the battle.

In Part II, Lee obtains the rank of Chunin, and is dispatched with his team to help save Gaara following his abduction by the criminal organization Akatsuki. During the events of the Fourth Shinobi War Lee is assigned to the Third Division, Lee helps in fighting the Kabuto Yakushi&#x27;s reanimated army and later aids Naruto Uzumaki in the fight against Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha. Years after the war, Lee marries an unknown woman and has a son named Metal Lee. In the epilogue, Lee is last seen many years later, training with his son. In &quot;&quot;, Lee hosts the third stage of the Chunin Exam.

=== In other media ===
Lee has made several appearances outside of the &quot;Naruto&quot; anime and manga. In the third featured film in the series, &quot;Naruto the Movie 3: The Animal Riot of Crescent Moon Island&quot;, Lee acts as a member of Team 7 for the duration of the film. In the , which is set in Part II, Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Neji Hyuga, and Lee are assigned to escort the maiden Shion, who needs to perform a ritual to seal a demonic army. Lee also appears in the third original video animation, participating in a tournament.

Lee is a playable character in nearly every &quot;Naruto&quot; video game, including the and the . In some games, he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or manga. &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; marks his first appearance in video games set in Part II. Rock Lee is also the main character of a spin-off manga by Kenji Taira that follows his training in comical misadventures. The manga was adapted into an anime series titled &quot;Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals&quot;.

== Reception ==
Lee has ranked highly in the &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; popularity polls for the series, initially continuously placing in the top ten and reaching fifth place once. In later polls, Lee lost his top ten status. Also, several pieces of merchandise based on Lee have also been released, including action figures of his Part I and Part II appearances, plush dolls, and keychains. &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; author Kōhei Horikoshi said that Rock Lee&#x27;s inhability to use ninjutsu and instead use hand-to-hand combat made him highly stand out in the manga. He also praised how heroic is Rock Lee&#x27;s portrayal in the Chunnin Exams when facing Orochimaru&#x27;s underlings.

Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other media have provided commentary on Lee&#x27;s character. IGN&#x27;s A.E. Sparrow called Lee one of his favorite characters in the series and compared his personality to that of Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher. Fellow editor Ramsey Isler ranked him as the eight best character on the series and said he &quot;was the true underdog of the series.&quot; Isler added, &quot;Perhaps a little too intense, but always fiercely devoted to his cause, Rock Lee added all sorts of flavor to the series.&quot; However, Rock Lee&#x27;s profile on IGN describes him as &quot;kind of stiff&quot; because of his very polite demeanor. Active Anime celebrated Lee&#x27;s introduction in the series as a comedic relief to the growing tension of the story at that point. &quot;Anime Insider&quot; listed him in their top five list for &quot;pure-hearted heroes&quot; from anime and manga publications, ranking at number five. &quot;Insider&quot; praised him for &quot;never [giving] up, even in the face of people with actual ninja powers.&quot;

Anime News Network referred to Lee as the &quot;star of [the Chunin Exam arc]&quot;, and claimed that he &quot;almost single-handedly rescues this arc from being tossed into the &#x27;entertaining but disposable&#x27; bin&quot;. His fight against Gaara in the exams was listed as second best one in anime by AnimeCentral. Anime News Network also called Lee the &quot;goofiest looking character&quot; in the series and praised Kishimoto&#x27;s &quot;ninja-punk visual sensibilities&quot; that allowed him to make Lee &quot;damn cool when the action starts&quot;. In the NEO Awards 2007 from &quot;Neo&quot;, Rock Lee won in the category &quot;Best Anime Character&quot;. He was also listed as one of the three &quot;Honorable Mentions&quot; from &quot;Naruto&quot; by Wizard Entertainment&#x27;s Danica Davidson with comments from the article being focused on Lee&#x27;s determination. When the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga ended, writer Yūto Kubota expressed that Lee was his favorite character.

<text>Jane is a fictional character in Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&quot; series. She is an energy based artificial sentient creature called an Aiúa that was placed within the ansible network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances. She has appeared in the novels &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, and &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, and in a short story &quot;Investment Counselor&quot;. Her &#x27;face&#x27;, a computer-generated hologram that she uses to talk to Ender, is described as plain and young, and it is illustrated in &quot;First Meetings&quot; as having a bun.

This article is arranged to reflect the Ender timeline. However, the Ender Quartet: &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; (1985), &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; (1986), &quot;Xenocide&quot; (1990), and &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; (1994) was written first; then &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1999), &quot;First Meetings&quot; (2004), and &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot; (2005).

==Origin==
===&quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;===
The Fantasy Game is the faculty&#x27;s primary method of obtaining information about their students in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. It is designed to secretly map out the psyche of the players, providing valuable data on each student&#x27;s thoughts and decision-making processes. Colonel Graff refers to the game sarcastically as the Mind Game. In the course of its service at the Battle School, the Game successfully analyzes every student but one: Bean, who realizes the game&#x27;s true purpose and refuses to play.

The student chooses a character and plays through a number of scenarios. One scenario, called the Giant&#x27;s Drink, offers the player a choice between two beverages, with the promise of admission to &quot;Fairyland&quot; with the correct choice. However, the scenario is actually a no-win situation which invariably results in the player&#x27;s death. By tracking how frequently a player attempts it, the Giant&#x27;s Drink detects and warns teachers of suicidal tendencies among the students. To their consternation, Ender confronts the Giant obsessively, failing dozens of times. Finally, he refuses to choose a drink and instead attacks the Giant, killing it and becoming the first student to enter Fairyland; the Game generates this new scenario on the spot, orienting it specifically to Ender himself. This creates a deep connection between him and the Game, with significant consequences later on.

===&quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;===
The Fantasy Game is discussed in greater depth in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;. It is described by the teachers themselves as an extremely complex program that generates content procedurally. The Mind Game is never meant to be conclusive, it only makes connections and discovers patterns that are too subtle for the human eye.

===&quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot;===
In &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot;, when Bean suspects Peter Wiggin of embezzling Ender&#x27;s trust fund for his Hegemony uses, he recalls the nature of the Fantasy Game and requests that Graff place it in charge of Ender&#x27;s trust fund. The Game, whose original purpose was to seek out patterns across wide fields of data, is modified to predict markets and invest Ender&#x27;s trust fund appropriately. Alarmingly effective in this new capacity, it is later called upon to review demographic data and help Bean find seven of his eight stolen embryos/children. The Fantasy Game is assumed to have grown in complexity during the 3000-year gap between &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, especially as Graff describes the Mind Game as being able to reprogram itself, and finally becomes the sentient Jane.

==Appearances==
===&quot;First Meetings&quot;===
&quot;Investment Counselor&quot;, a short story in &quot;First Meetings&quot;, describes the first meeting between Jane and Ender where Jane presents herself to Ender as a computerized program meant to help with taxes. Ender takes her up on the offer, and begins a lifelong friendship with this computer entity.

===&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;===
Jane is first introduced in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; as an advanced computer program. She is extremely complex, capable of performing trillions of tasks simultaneously, and has millions of levels of attention, even her most unaware one being much more alert than a human. Jane is hesitant to reveal herself to humanity, because she knows that she is the epitome of humanity&#x27;s fear: an intelligent, thinking, computer program that cannot be controlled. She decided to reveal herself to Ender after she found out he wrote &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; and &quot;The Hegemon&quot;, in hopes that he would eventually understand her and one day reveal her true nature to humanity. She also &quot;remembered&quot; he was the only student to pass the Giant&#x27;s Drink, one of the many Fantasy Game situations.

An electronic &quot;jewel&quot; in Ender&#x27;s ear allows both of them to communicate and for her to see and hear everything from Ender&#x27;s vantage point. She helps Ender with many things. For example, in the very beginning, she contacts an orbiting ship and pays $40 billion for it and the cargo. Ender&#x27;s reliance on Jane becomes obvious when she no longer helps him; he must ask young Olhado to help him with his finances and computer searches, and does not know the password to his own bank account.

Jane plays a pivotal role in the development of the book. Jane guides Ender to Lusitania and helps him out considerably in obtaining information. In a pivotal scene, Ender impatiently disconnects her by turning off the jewel; Jane panics and is forced to reorient her vast amount of concentration which was focused on him. Concluding that Ender needs a common enemy to unite all of Lusitania together to help the piggies, she runs analysis on data and subversively gets Starways Congress to order the destruction of the planet. She makes it appear as if Lusitania has cut off their ansible (she did this mainly to save a xenologer from being killed), triggering Starways Congress to send the &quot;Evacuation Fleet,&quot; which is actually carrying the Molecular Disruption Device to destroy the planet. With the threat, Ender unites the colony to form a treaty with the piggies to assure mutual cooperation and peaceful coexistence.

No longer attached to Ender, she bonds with Miro, Ender&#x27;s depressed paralyzed stepson.

===&quot;Xenocide&quot;===
In this novel, she silences the Lusitania Fleet by making it disappear from all ansibles. Starways Congress contracts the brightest mind on a world of geniuses, Han Fei-Tzu, to discover what happened to the fleet, as previous attempts have failed. He passes the task to his daughter, Han Qing-Jao. Jane has left no evidence, however, and it is precisely this lack of evidence that leads Qing-Jao to conclude that some unseen force is operating and monitoring all the ansibles at once. Although she suspects that it is the work of the gods, Jane realizes that Qing-Jao will eventually discover her existence.

Facing defeat, Jane reveals herself to Qing-Jao and her intellectually neglected servant, Si Wang-Mu. After a heated discussion, Qing-Jao despairs because Jane&#x27;s power is vast; Jane can shut down all the ansibles, making it impossible for Qing-Jao to reveal Jane&#x27;s presence. However, Jane knows that she cannot continue to silence Qing-Jao&#x27;s message forever, since it would snowball into cutting off the entire planet of Path. Thus, Jane refuses to silence the ansible, Qing-Jao sends the message, and Starways Congress plans the systematic silencing of all ansibles to kill Jane.

In this book it is revealed that the Hive Queens, who were seeking a way to contact Ender during his crusade, attempted to construct a philotic &#x27;bridge&#x27; so that they could contact him. This bridge was meant to be a connection between Ender, whose philotic web they did not understand, and a structure whose philotic web they &quot;did&quot; understand; for this baseline, they chose the Fantasy Game, since Ender was so deeply focused upon it and since its structure was sufficiently orderly. Jane was the bridge they constructed, imbuing her with the quality which all living things have, an &quot;aiúa&quot; (resembling a soul). Jane, in other words, is an intelligent being, not just a collection of software. The Hive Queen further explains that Jane&#x27;s &quot;aiúa&quot; was called from a space outside of the universe, just as all &quot;aiúas&quot; are. Grego and Olhado, hearing this, hypothesize that, if someone can somehow contain all the information on how a spaceship&#x27;s philotes are organized (i.e., its structure down to a subatomic level), that person could essentially &quot;will&quot; the spaceship Outside and In again, instantaneously (that is, without any time passing). This will be entirely dependent on Jane, since no other being possesses the ample mental capacity to hold the complete structure of an object in its mind.

Jane&#x27;s test flight consists of a sealed box with a door, Ender (to whom Jane is inextricably philotically linked; indeed, her &quot;aiúa&quot; resides within him), Miro (for the same reason), and Ela (so that she can create the recolada virus once they are Outside). While Outside, Ela creates the recolada virus, Miro recreates his healthy body and possesses it, and Ender unconsciously creates duplicates of his childhood brother and sister.

===&quot;Children of the Mind&quot;===
In the conclusion of the Ender Saga, Jane finds herself rapidly running out of processing power due to Starways Congress shutting down her active ansible connections one at a time in an attempt to deactivate her for good. The Congress completes the shutdown of all universal ansible connections, forcing Jane&#x27;s &quot;aiúa&quot; (the term Jane uses to describe the entity of life which all living things have) to seek refuge amongst the Philotic Web of the Pequenino Mother-Trees.

Jane is also simultaneously responsible for instantaneous travel. A simple spacecraft is constructed (later deemed unnecessary due to Jane&#x27;s precision in transportation), and through holding the image of the traveler in her consciousness, Jane can pick up the image and place it anywhere in the universe instantly. This advancement is threatened by Congress&#x27; attempt to deactivate her &quot;program.&quot;

In the end, Jane is given corporeal form in the body created in the form of young Valentine, made of a portion of Ender&#x27;s aiúa. Jane&#x27;s aiúa is capable of transcending this corporeal form and returning to the philotic link of the Mother-Trees, or the reconstructed ansible network of which she was born, thus preserving the instantaneous method of travel. Jane, now in the possession of Val&#x27;s body, marries Miro in a double-wedding ceremony along with Peter and Si-Wang-Mu.

==Development==
Card wasn&#x27;t aware at the time of writing &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; that the computer that Ender interacted with would become a character. Card considers Jane&#x27;s character pivotal in developing Ender&#x27;s adult persona and in the process, she became a living thing as well. Her character became a major theme of the &quot;Xenocide&quot;. After killing the Buggers, Ender is responsible for reconciling the differences between the Piggies and Humans. In the process, Jane&#x27;s character, as the sole member of her species, also must face reconciling with humanity.

==Critical reception==
In a collection of criticism columns, David Langford commented that Jane&#x27;s character was &quot;unnecessary to the main action&quot; of the story. In Sarah Kember&#x27;s &quot;Cyberfeminism and Artificial Life&quot;, Jane is compared to HAL from &quot;A Space Odyssey&quot;. Unlike HAL, which Kember described as artificial intelligence, Jane is artificial life and capable of asking critical questions about the nature of her existence.

<doc id="1145263" wikidata="Q1245875" url="?curid=1145263" title="Missouri Pacific Railroad">
<text>The Missouri Pacific Railroad , commonly abbreviated as MoPac, was one of the first railroads in the United States west of the Mississippi River. MoPac was a Class I railroad growing from dozens of predecessors and mergers. In 1967, the railroad operated 9,041 miles of road and 13,318 miles of track, not including , NO&amp;LC, T&amp;P, and its subsidiaries C&amp;EI and Missouri-Illinois.

Union Pacific Corporation, the parent company of the Union Pacific Railroad, agreed to buy the Missouri Pacific Railroad on January 8, 1980. Lawsuits filed by competing railroads delayed approval of the merger until September 13, 1982. After the Supreme Court denied a trial to the Southern Pacific, the merger took effect on December 22, 1982. However, due to outstanding bonds of the Missouri Pacific, its full merger into the Union Pacific Railroad did not become official until January 1, 1997.

== History ==
On July 4, 1851, ground was broken at St. Louis on the Pacific Railroad, the predecessor of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The first section of track was completed in 1852; in 1865, it was the first railroad in Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railway by new investors after a railroad debt crisis. Because of corporate ties extending back to the Pacific Railroad, Missouri Pacific at one time advertised itself as being &quot;The First Railroad West of the Mississippi&quot;.

Other predecessors included the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (SLIMS), Texas and Pacific Railway (TP), Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (C&amp;EI), St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway (SLBM), Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (KO&amp;G), Midland Valley Railroad (MV), San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad (SAU&amp;G), Gulf Coast Lines (GC), International-Great Northern Railroad (IGN), Kansas, Nebraska &amp; Dakota Railroad, New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway (NOTM), Missouri-Illinois Railroad (MI), as well as the small Central Branch Railway (an early predecessor of MP in Kansas and south-central Nebraska), and joint ventures such as the Alton and Southern Railroad (AS).

Missouri Pacific was under the control of New York financier Jay Gould from 1879 until his death in 1892. Gould developed a system extending through Colorado, Nebraska, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. His son George Gould inherited control upon his father&#x27;s death, but lost control of the company after it declared bankruptcy in 1915. The line was merged with the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (SLIMS) and reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1917. Missouri Pacific later acquired or gained a controlling interest in other lines in Texas, including the Gulf Coast Lines, International-Great Northern Railroad, and the Texas and Pacific Railway.

The railroad&#x27;s first heavy repair shops were built in Sedalia, Missouri in 1872. In 1905 several smaller shop sites were consolidated at Sedalia when the old shops were closed and moved to a new site along Marshall Avenue. The MoPac began using the Baring Cross Shops of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1882. A fire in 1900 caused them to be rebuilt on a larger scale that would ultimately become the primary MoPac shop site (now known as the Downing B. Jenks Shops). Minor locomotive repairs were carried out at the terminals in St. Louis and Kansas City. 

MoPac declared bankruptcy again in 1933, during the Great Depression, and entered into trusteeship. The company was reorganized and the trusteeship ended in 1956.

By the 1980s, the system owned of rail line over 11 states bounded by Chicago to the east, Pueblo, Colorado, in the west, north to Omaha, south to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, and southeast along the Gulf seaports of Louisiana and Texas. MoPac operated a fleet of more than 1,500 diesel locomotives, almost all purchased within the previous 10 years. Under the leadership of Downing B. Jenks, who became president and chief executive in 1961, the company became a pioneer in the early days of computer-guided rail technology. It was a major hauler of coal, grain, ore, autos, dry goods and shipping containers. At the time of its mega-merger in 1982, the MoPac owned more and newer locomotives and operated more track than partner Union Pacific Railroad.

On December 22, 1982, the Missouri Pacific was purchased by the Union Pacific Corporation and combined with the Western Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad to form one large railroad system. The new entity was called Pacific Rail Systems; though part of the Union Pacific Corporation, all three railroads maintained their own corporate and commercial identity. On December 1, 1989, the Missouri Kansas Texas and the Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson were merged into the Missouri Pacific after having been acquired by the Union Pacific Corporation in 1988.

By 1994, all motive power of the Missouri Pacific was repainted and on January 1, 1997, the Missouri Pacific was officially merged into the Union Pacific Railroad by the Union Pacific Corporation. UP continued to use the MoPac headquarters building at 210 N. 13th St. in downtown St. Louis for its customer service center until February 15, 2005. The former MoPac building has undergone rehab as apartments and is now known as Park Pacific.

In this table, &quot;MP&quot; includes New Orleans Texas &amp; Mexico and all its subsidiary railroads (Beaumont Sour Lake &amp; Western, I-GN, StLB&amp;M, etc.) that officially merged into MP in 1956. Ton-miles for C&amp;EI in 1970 presumably don&#x27;t include the L&amp;N portion.

By that same definition, MP operated 10,431 route-miles at the end of 1929, after A&amp;G, SAS and Sugar Land had come under NOT&amp;M; NO&amp;LC operated 60 and DK&amp;S (not subsidiary until 1931) operated 6. At the end of 1960, MP operated 9,362 route-miles, NO&amp;LC and DK&amp;S were the same, and M-I operated 172 miles.

&quot;T&amp;P&quot; includes its subsidiary roads (A&amp;S, D&amp;PS, T-NM etc.); operated route-miles totaled 2,259 at the end of 1929 (after C≠, PVS and TSL had become subsidiaries) and 2,033 at the end of 1960.

== Passenger train service ==

In the early years of the 20th century, most Missouri Pacific and St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern passenger trains were designated by number only, with little emphasis on premier name trains. This changed in May, 1915, with the inauguration of the &quot;Scenic Limited&quot; between St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Between Pueblo, Colorado and Salt Lake City, the &quot;Scenic Limited&quot; operated through the Royal Gorge over the tracks of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. From Salt Lake City to San Francisco, the &quot;Scenic Limited&quot; operated over the Western Pacific Railroad. A second premier train, the &quot;Sunshine Special&quot; began operating on December 5, 1915, between St. Louis and San Antonio via Little Rock and Austin. Another named train, the &quot;Rainbow Special&quot;, was placed in service in July 1921 between Kansas City and Little Rock. The &quot;Sunshine Special&quot; soon eclipsed the other trains in travel volume, becoming the signature train of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. An advertising slogan in 1933 proclaimed: &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s 70-degrees in the &quot;Sunshine&quot; when it&#x27;s 100-degrees in the shade&quot;,&quot; referring to the fact that the &quot;Sunshine Special&quot; was one of the first air-conditioned trains in the southwest. When new streamlined trains were delivered, the &quot;Scenic Limited&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Special&quot; names faded, but the &quot;Sunshine Special&quot; had sufficient name recognition to co-exist along with the new streamliners into the late 1950s.

In the streamliner era, the Missouri Pacific&#x27;s premier passenger trains were collectively known as the &quot;Eagles&quot;. A variety of &quot;Eagle&quot; trains were operated, with the first such train inaugurated in 1940. These routes included the &quot;Missouri River Eagle&quot; (St. Louis-Kansas City-Omaha), the &quot;Delta Eagle&quot; (Memphis, Tennessee-Tallulah, Louisiana), the &quot;Colorado Eagle&quot; (St. Louis-Pueblo-Denver), the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (St. Louis to Texas), and the &quot;Valley Eagle&quot; (Houston-Corpus Christi-Brownsville, Texas).

Other notable MoPac trains operated included:

*the &quot;Houstonian&quot; (between New Orleans and Houston);
*&quot;Missourian&quot; (between St. Louis and Kansas City);
*&quot;Orleanean&quot; (between Houston and New Orleans);
*&quot;Ozarker&quot; (between St. Louis and Little Rock);
*&quot;Pioneer&quot; (between Houston and Brownsville);
*&quot;Southerner&quot; (service from Kansas City and St. Louis to New Orleans, via Little Rock);
*&quot;Southern Scenic&quot; (between Kansas City and Memphis);
*&quot;Sunflower&quot; (between St. Louis and Wichita); and
*the &quot;Texan&quot; (between St. Louis and Fort Worth).

Missouri Pacific gained a reputation for aggressively discontinuing passenger trains after the mid-1960s. When the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) assumed passenger train operations on May 1, 1971, the only Missouri Pacific route included as part of Amtrak&#x27;s basic system was its main line from St. Louis to Kansas City. This route is now served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; (named for the fact that it runs mostly parallel to the Missouri River). On March 13, 1974, Amtrak restored passenger train service over segments of Missouri Pacific-Texas and Pacific&#x27;s original &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; route between St. Louis, Little Rock, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Laredo with the &quot;Inter-American.&quot; This train was renamed the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; in 1981, resurrecting the name of the famous MoPac train. The Amtrak version runs over former MoPac and T&amp;P trackage for much of its route.
== Honorary tribute ==
On July 30, 2005, UP unveiled a brand new EMD SD70ACe locomotive, Union Pacific 1982, with Missouri Pacific paint and logos, as part of a new heritage program.

<doc id="1145273" wikidata="Q3177110" url="?curid=1145273" title="Tsunade">
<text>Tsunade (), featured in the Japanese folktale , is Jiraiya&#x27;s wife and is taught slug magic by an old man whose real body turns out to be a slug. Her magic is strong against snake magic.

== English translation – Jiraiya, or the Magic Frog ==

=== Plot ===
A popular version of the story was translated by William Elliot Griffis. In his version, a young maiden named Tsunade lived in a province of Kiushiu. She was a model daughter and was always obedient and kind. One day during her trip into the mountains for firewood she met a very old man who approached her and told her he had lived in the mountains for hundreds of years and that his body was really that of a snail. He then offers to teach Tsunade the powers of magic he possesses. She gladly accepted and began training daily with the old man. Once she had mastered the magic, she was advised to use her powers to defend the poor and destroy wicked robbers, and to join her powers with Jiraiya in the form of marriage. The old man then turns into a snail and crawls away. Tsunade then remarks that she and Jiraiya with the combination of slug magic and frog magic would be able to destroy a robber named Orochimaru, who was the son of a serpent. Tsunade and Jiraiya eventually met and were married soon after.

Soon after Jiraiya and Tsunade were married war broke out in Japan between the Tsukikage and the Inukage. In the war, the Tsukikage sought out the help of Jiraiya and Tsunade who agreed to help them with the war, while the other clan the Inukage sought the help of Orochimaru otherwise known as Dragon-coil. Orochimaru was known as a very wicked robber whose father was a man and mother was a serpent that lived at the bottom of lake Takura, he was skilled in the magic of the serpent and would spew venom on the strongest of warriors to destroy them.

During a respite between the conflicts, Jiraiya and Tsunade were resting in a monastery. In the monastery, there was also a princess named Tagoto that had fled from Orochimaru as he wanted her to be his bride. She hated Orochimaru and did not want to marry him, however, when Orochimaru upon hearing that Tagoto and Jiraiya were in the same monastery, immediately made his way to the monastery. He then kidnapped the princess Tagoto and poured poisonous venom onto the sleeping Jiraiya and Tsunade. After they are poisoned one of Jiraiya&#x27;s pages, Rikimatsu, volunteers to go to India to retrieve the only antidote to cure Jiraiya and Tsunade. Rikimatsu then uses the magic he learned from the Tengus of the mountains he flies to India and back in one day and one night to deliver the antidote. After Jiraiya and his wife recovered the war broke out again, and in a great battle Orochimaru was killed and Tagoto was rescued. Jiraiya was rewarded by being made a daimyo of Idzu.

At this point, Jiraiya had grown tired of war and the hardships that an active life brought, and he and Tsunade settled down to a peaceful life in Idzu. They spent the remainder of their days in peace and tranquility among their children and grandchildren.

== Influences on fiction ==
In the manga and anime series &quot;Naruto&quot;, characters named Tsunade, Jiraiya, and Orochimaru appear as three legendary ninja known as the &quot;Densetsu no Sannin&quot; (伝説の三忍).

<text>Avery Island (historically ) is a salt dome best known as the source of Tabasco sauce. Located in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, United States, it is about inland from Vermilion Bay, which opens onto the Gulf of Mexico. A small human population lives on the island. The island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Native Americans discovered that the island&#x27;s verdant flora covered a precious natural resource: a massive salt dome. They boiled the island&#x27;s briny spring water to extract salt, which they traded to other tribes as far away as central Texas, Arkansas, and Ohio.

The island had been named Petite Anse Island by 1818, when it was purchased by John Craig Marsh of New Jersey, according to records maintained before 1999 in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Marsh operated a sugar plantation on the island&#x27;s fertile soil. In 1837, his daughter Sarah Craig Marsh married Daniel Dudley Avery a jurist from Baton Rouge. In 1849, Avery became co-owner of his in-law&#x27;s sugar plantation, and in 1855 he became sole owner.

Edmund McIlhenny joined the Avery family before the Civil War, marrying Daniel and Sarah&#x27;s daughter Mary Eliza Avery.
In 1868, McIlhenny founded McIlhenny Company, and began manufacturing Tabasco brand pepper sauce. In 1870, he received letters patent for his sauce-processing formula. That same basic process is still used today.

In 1938, his son, Edward Avery McIlhenny established a nutria farm on Avery Island, Louisiana, near the factory where the company that bears his family name makes Tabasco sauce. According to company history, McIlhenny bought his stock of nutrias from a farm near New Orleans, so he was not the first to introduce the creature, a native of southern Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, to North America. What is certain, though, is that McIlhenny, for reasons unknown, released an unknown but probably large number of nutrias into the wild from the confines of Avery Island, and from there they fanned out and proliferated.

Avery Island was hit hard in September 2005 by Hurricane Rita. According to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; the family spent $5 million on constructing a -high levee, pumps, and back-up generators to ensure that future hurricanes will not disrupt Tabasco sauce production.

===Bird sanctuary===

Under the Avery/McIlhenny family&#x27;s management, Avery Island has remained somewhat protected, inhabited by many animal species, although the many plants are non-native.
Edward Avery McIlhenny, or &quot;Mr. Ned&quot; as he was affectionately known, founded this bird colony—later called Bird City—around 1895 after plume hunters had slaughtered egrets by the thousands to provide feathers for ladies&#x27; hats. Edward gathered eight young egrets, raised them in captivity on the island, and released them in the fall to migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The following spring the birds returned to the island with others of their species, a migration that continues today.

McIlhenny&#x27;s illustrated and written documentation of plant and animal life on Avery Island was donated to the Louisiana State University library.

===Non-native plants===
Edward McIlhenny introduced numerous varieties of azaleas, camellias, papyrus sedge, and other non-native plants to the Island&#x27;s ecosystem. When oil was discovered on the Island in 1942, he ensured that production crews bypassed live oak trees and buried pipelines (or painted them green) so the petroleum extraction didn&#x27;t harm the aesthetics.

Avery Island is surrounded on all sides by bayous (slow-moving, muddy rivers), salt marsh, and swampland; it sits about west of New Orleans. The island was a sugar plantation formerly known as &quot;Petite Anse Island&quot;. (&quot;Petite Anse&quot; means &quot;Little Cove&quot; in Cajun French.) Access to the island is via a toll road (technically a very low toll bridge), though a toll is no longer charged for visitors, including tourists.

At its highest point, the island is above mean sea level. It covers about and is about across at its widest point.

===Geology===
Avery Island is actually a huge dome of rock salt, long and wide. It was created by the upwelling of ancient evaporite (salt) deposits that exist beneath the Mississippi River Delta region. These upwellings are known as &quot;salt domes&quot;. Avery Island is one of five salt dome islands that rise above the flat Louisiana Gulf coast. The Five Islands from northwest to southeast are Jefferson Island, Avery Island, Weeks Island, Cote Blanche Island and Belle Isle.

==Government and infrastructure==
The United States Postal Service operates the Avery Island Post Office.

==Education==
The Iberia Parish School System operates the public schools in the area. Students attend schools in New Iberia. Students are zoned to Center Street Elementary School, Iberia Middle School, and New Iberia Senior High School.

Avery Island Elementary School (K-6) formerly served the community. After the 2007–2008 school year, students from Avery Island Elementary were moved to Center Street Elementary School. At the time, 118 children attended Avery Island Elementary. While Avery Island Elementary operated, it fed into the same middle and high schools that Center Street feeds into: Iberia MS and New Iberia HS.

Iberia Parish is in the service area of Fletcher Technical Community College and of South Louisiana Community College.

<doc id="1145284" wikidata="Q4861983" url="?curid=1145284" title="Barnstorm (album)">
<text>Barnstorm is the debut studio album by the American rock band Barnstorm, which was formed by guitarist Joe Walsh after he left the James Gang. The album was released in October 1972 on the labels ABC and Dunhill. It was the first album to be recorded at Caribou Ranch in Colorado.

== History ==

With this album, Walsh moved away from the hard rock sound of the James Gang, with Barnstorm exploring a more folk-based, acoustic sound, influenced by such artists as James Taylor and Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

Taking a cue from The Who&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend, Walsh utilized the ARP Odyssey synthesizer on such songs as &quot;Mother Says&quot; and &quot;Here We Go.&quot; Walsh also experimented with acoustic guitar, slide guitar, fuzzboxes and keyboards as well as running his guitar straight into a Leslie 122 speaker to get swirly, organ-like guitar tones. The lone hard rock track on &quot;Barnstorm&quot;, &quot;Turn To Stone&quot;, has become the best known song from the album, since Walsh later re-recorded it for his solo album &quot;So What&quot;.

At the time of its release, &quot;Barnstorm&quot; was only moderately successful. For many years, the only CD version available was an expensive Japanese import. Nonetheless, the album became a cult classic among Walsh fans. It was later reissued in the U.S. on CD by Hip-O Select/Geffen Records in January 2006.

== Critical reception ==

Writing for AllMusic, critic Thom Jurek called the track &quot;Birdcall Morning&quot; a masterpiece and one of the greatest rock and roll love songs of the early 1970s. In his review, he wrote of the album &quot;While it&#x27;s true that Walsh established himself as a late-&#x27;60s/early-&#x27;70s guitar hero on the Gang&#x27;s more boogie-oriented rock numbers, it&#x27;s Walsh&#x27;s love of lushly textured production and spacey, open-ended songs featuring both acoustic and electric guitars that is showcased here on this wildly adventurous and forgotten unqualified masterpiece... Walsh tips the scales one more time back to the mysterious in the acoustic guitar and harmonica moment &quot;Comin&#x27; Down.&quot; It&#x27;s another love song, which evokes the notion of the past as a way of creating a hopeful present. And it just whispers to a close, leaving the listener literally stunned at what has just transpired in the space of 35 minutes.&quot;

== 2011 reissue ==
On 29 December 2011, the original mix of the album was reissued in Japan in a miniature replica of the original album artwork. The album was remastered using Direct Stream Digital (DSD) to transfer the digital files. The release was a limited edition in the SHM-CD format. The reissue included a picture of the original vinyl label.

== Track listing ==
All songs written and composed by Joe Walsh, unless otherwise noted.
&quot;I&#x27;ll Tell the World&quot; is titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Tell the World About You&quot; on the ABC Dunhill Label fixed to the album.

<doc id="1145302" wikidata="Q5600102" url="?curid=1145302" title="Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance">
<text>Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance is the debut album by the Australian band TISM. The album peaked at No. 48 on the ARIA Charts in October 1988.

The vinyl version has a different vocal mix on the track, &quot;Saturday Night Palsy&quot;, including an alternate line of lyrics, with the line &quot;I want to shoot heroin through the eye&quot; replaced by &quot;I want to shove a red-hot poker through the eye&quot; on the CD.

The title is derived from the band&#x27;s first album-length recording, which was recorded in December 1982, shortly after the group&#x27;s formation.

In March 2022, LP and CD reissues were announced, with the CD containing a bonus album with 40 minutes of unreleased content. A cassette reissue, featuring the bonus content and the LP version of the cover art on cassette for the first time, had been released that February. The CD was released that May, with the LP following in August due to delays involving the cover art.

==Singles==
* &quot;40 Years – Then Death&quot; was released in September 1987 as the album&#x27;s lead single. The song details an early-twenties male&#x27;s despondent view of his remaining sex life: 40 more years of &quot;living&quot; then &quot;death&quot;. In 2024, the song was rewritten with new lyrics and retitled &quot;14 Years - Then Death&quot;.
* &quot;The Ballad of John Bonham&#x27;s Coke Roadie&quot; was released in May 1988. The song deals with the assistant to Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham, whose job was to procure cocaine for the musician. Throughout the song the musician compares his life to that of an ordinary person whose life is racked with misery and spousal unfaithfulness, contrasted with that of the roadie, whose only concern is the acquisition of cocaine.
* &quot;I&#x27;m Interested in Apathy&quot; was released in September 1988 as the album&#x27;s third single. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989, the song won ARIA Award for Best Independent Release.
*&quot;Saturday Night Palsy&quot; was released in January 1989 as the fourth single. The song focuses on a man who has the inability to decide on matters, particularly, in which manner to harm himself. The song continues through with various opposing scenarios offered by the man, but at the end nothing has been resolved. A music video was directed by Peter Bain-Hog and featured a handsome man spending his day getting ready to go out dancing. Eventually he finds himself outside of a TISM concert and denied entry, at the end of the video, he is so dejected by the experience that he commits suicide by hanging himself in a nearby alley. TISM performed the song Australian variety TV show, &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;.
*&quot;Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a Jovial Fellow&quot; was released in June 1989 as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single. The song deals with the dark and often depressing nature of Scorsese&#x27;s subjects and the way that a normally happy or perky person would also be quite depressed after watching one of his films.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Age&quot;″s Shaun Carney, in September 1988, described &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; as &quot;a fine piece of work. Clever clever they might be on occasions, but if a few more bands applied even half the humor, social observation and melodic intervention that TISM seems to simply toss off, the world would be a, um, groovier place.&quot;

Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic rated the album as four-and-a-half stars out of five, he explained &quot;Completely tasteless and musically mediocre, the album was nonetheless fresh, witty, and extremely funny. The album is more or less standard guitar rock, but it is the song lyrics that make this album great.&quot;

In December 2004 &quot;FasterLouder&quot;″s Kathryn Kernohan felt the group had &quot;always written simple, direct pop songs... [their] basic structure has remained the same – danceable guitar and keyboard lines coupled with catchy choruses. The band’s ability to write a ridiculously good pop song is second-to-none and this is no better exemplified than in &quot;Great Truckin’ Songs&quot; opening tracks.&quot; She noticed that &quot;The second record of the double-vinyl set (it&#x27;s not as much fun on CD, is it?) contains various odds and ends, including snippets of a Triple R interview in which the band rode into the studio on lawnmowers.&quot;

==Track listing==

The team bears the nickname &quot;Amavubi&quot; (Kinyarwanda for &quot;The Wasps&quot;), and primarily plays its home games at the Stade Amahoro in Kigali, the nation&#x27;s capital. They have never qualified for a World Cup finals, and reached their only Africa Cup of Nations in 2004.

==History==
Rwanda qualified for its first ever Africa Cup of Nations in the 2004 edition. At the tournament, they lost their opening match 2–1 to Tunisia before winning their first ever point in the competition after a 1–1 draw against Guinea. Rwanda went on to beat DR Congo in their final group match by a 1–0 scoreline, but it wasn&#x27;t enough, as elsewhere in the group, Guinea and Tunisia drew, meaning both teams progressed to the quarter-finals, and Rwanda were eliminated.

===Kit===
In 2001, after adopting the new flag of Rwanda, The Federation &quot;(FERWAFA)&quot; changed the color of the team kit. The new team kit consists of a yellow jersey, blue shorts and green socks for home matches, while their away kit is either all white or all blue. Adidas has generally been the manufacturer for the Rwandan team since 2001. However, between 2004 and 2009, Rwanda used L-sport as their outfitter, and in 2015 the side started wearing kit provided by AMS, an emerging Australian supplier.

===Names===
Under the official FIFA Trigramme the team&#x27;s name is abbreviated as RWA; this acronym is used by FIFA, the CAF and the CECAFA to identify the team in official competitions. However the team was more commonly known as the RR, the acronym for the country&#x27;s official name, &quot;Repubulika y&#x27;u Rwanda&quot; or &quot;République du Rwanda&quot;, which the local press used when they referred to the team as the RR XI. The national team is often referred to as &quot;Amavubi&quot; (The Wasps).

<text>Anza Vista is a neighborhood in the Western Addition district of San Francisco, California. It is named after Juan Bautista de Anza, the first Spanish explorer to reach San Francisco.

==History==

It sits atop the former location of the San Francisco Calvary Cemetery. Graves in this cemetery, along with all graves in San Francisco, were moved in the 1930s and 1940s to Colma after burials in San Francisco were banned in 1902 at all but two cemeteries to increase available real estate.

==Geography==
Anza Vista is located between Geary Boulevard to the north, Turk Street to the south, Masonic Avenue to the west and Divisadero Street to the east. Some of the surrounding areas between The Presidio, Golden Gate Park, the Panhandle, and the Western Addition may sometimes be referred to as part of the Anza Vista neighborhood.

==Economy==
A Target-anchored shopping center, The City Center, is located on Geary Boulevard and Masonic Avenue in the northwestern corner of the neighborhood.

Anza Vista is also the location of a Kaiser Permanente hospital on Geary Boulevard at St. Joseph&#x27;s Avenue, and the Raoul Wallenberg Traditional High School on Nido Avenue.

<doc id="1145313" wikidata="Q1585455" url="?curid=1145313" title="Saoshyant">
<text>Saoshyant ( ) is an Avestan-language term that literally means &quot;one who brings benefit&quot;, and which is used in several different ways in Zoroastrian scripture and tradition. In particular, the expression is the proper name of &quot;the&quot; Saoshyant, an eschatological saviour figure who brings about &quot;Frashokereti&quot;, the final renovation of the world in which evil is finally destroyed. The term was contracted to &quot;Soshans&quot; in Zoroastrian tradition and came to apply to three saviour figures that were prophesied to progressively bring about the final renovation.

==Etymology==
The Avestan word &quot;Saoshyant&quot; derives from an active participle (indicated by the ) of the future stem of the verbal root /, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;&quot; &#x27;to swell&#x27;. The Avestan &#x27;strong&#x27; and &#x27;ever-thriving&#x27; derive from this root. Over time, the verbal root acquired the extended meanings &#x27;to be of use, profit, advantage&#x27; and &#x27;to create profit, use, advantage, to further&#x27;. It is in this extended sense that the word &quot;Saoshyant&quot; was understood by Zoroastrians. In stanzas 128 and 129 of &quot;Yasht&quot; 13, the following explanation of the word&#x27;s etymology is given: &quot;we worship the of righteous , who will be the Victorious by name ... (he is called) because he will further () all material life&quot;.

==In scripture==
In the Gathas, the most sacred hymns of Zoroastrianism, believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the term is used as a common noun to refer to the prophet&#x27;s own mission and to his community of followers, who &quot;bring benefit&quot; to humanity. The common noun also appears in the Younger Avesta (e.g. &quot;Yasna&quot; 61.5), where it generically denotes religious leaders, including Zoroaster (e.g. &quot;Yasna&quot; 46.3) Another common noun &quot;airyaman&quot; &quot;member of community&quot; is an epithet of these &quot;saoshyant&quot;s. In contrast, the standing epithet of the saviour figure(s) is &quot;embodying righteousness,&quot; which has &quot;arta&quot;/&quot;asha&quot; &quot;Truth&quot; as an element of the name. These saviours are those who follow Ahura Mazda&#x27;s teaching &quot;with acts inspired by &quot;asha&quot;&quot; (&quot;Yasna&quot; 48.12).

&quot;Saoshyant&quot; first appears as a proper name in the Younger Avesta, explicitly so in &quot;Yasht&quot; 13.129 where it is used in the singular and where Astvat-ereta develops into an alternate name of the Saoshyant. The singular also appears in &quot;Yasna&quot; 59.1 where Verethragna is said to be Saoshyant&#x27;s weapon in overcoming resistance. A plural form appears for instance in &quot;Yasht&quot; 17.1 where Ashi—the divinity of &quot;recompense&quot;—is described to give the Saoshyants the power of &quot;making wonderful&quot; (&quot;frasho.kereti&quot;). The term may also be rendered as &quot;Renovation&quot; and can be translated etymologically as &quot;juicy-making&quot;. 

The role of the Saoshyant, or Astvat-ereta, as a future saviour of the world is briefly described in Yasht 19.88-96, where it is stated that he will achieve the Frashokereti, that he will make the world perfect and immortal, and evil and Druj will disappear. He is identified as the son of Vîspa.taurwairî and it is stated that he will come forth from Lake Kansaoya/Kansava and will carry the same weapon Verethragna that a number of Iranian epic heroes and kings have used in the past against various demonic foes. Haurvatat, Ameretat, the righteous Dūraoša and other similar entities will be his companions and together, they will vanquish the evil creations of Angra Mainyu.

==In tradition==
Already alluded to in scripture (e.g. &quot;Yasht&quot; 19.88-96, see above), but only properly developed in the 9th–12th century texts, is the role of the Saoshyant during the final renovation. In these Middle Persian texts, the name is contracted to &quot;Soshans&quot; or similar (&quot;Sōshans&quot; in living Zoroastrianism).

Those medieval works of Zoroastrian tradition envision three future saviours, each of them a Soshans/Saoshyant, with one for the end of each thousand-year period that comprise the last 3,000 years of the world (these three millennia follow the &quot;millennium of Zoroaster&quot;). According to the tradition (found e.g. in the &quot;Jamasp Namag&quot;), the first Saoshyant will be named (H)Ushedar, the second (H)Ushedarmah and the third will again be &quot;the&quot; Saoshyant, who will lead humanity in the final battle against evil. The medieval works also transmit a tradition in which the three future saviours are mythologised as born of maidens, conceived while their mothers bathed in a lake that miraculously preserved the seed of the prophet Zoroaster himself. 

The story of the Saoshyant&#x27;s conception and early life are described in &quot;Denkard&quot; 7.10.15ff as follows: Thirty years before the decisive final battle, a maiden named Eredat-fedhri (&quot;Victorious Helper&quot;) and whose nickname is &quot;Body-maker&quot; will enter a lake (in Yasht 19.92, this is &quot;Lake Kansava&quot;). Sitting in the water, the girl, who has &quot;not associated with men&quot; will receive &quot;victorious knowledge.&quot; Her son, when born, will not know nourishment from his mother, his body will be sun-like, and the &quot;royal glory&quot; of the Khvarenah will be with him. Then, for the next 57 years he will subsist on only vegetables (17 years), then only water (30 years) and then for the final 10 years only on &quot;spiritual food.&quot;

The events of the final renovation are described in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (30.1ff): In the final battle with evil, the yazatas Airyaman and Atar will &quot;melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river&quot; (&quot;Bundahishn&quot; 34.18) but the righteous (i.e., the &quot;ashavan&quot;) will not be harmed. Eventually, Ahura Mazda will triumph, and his agent Saoshyant will resurrect the dead, whose bodies will be restored to eternal perfection, and whose souls will be cleansed and reunited with God. Time will then end, and &quot;asha&quot; and immortality will thereafter be everlasting.

==In the Bahá&#x27;í Faith==

Bahá&#x27;í tradition considers the prophecies of the Saoshyant (Bahá&#x27;i &#x27;Soshyosh&#x27;) to have been fulfilled in the person of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, while the prior two Soshans of Zoroastrian tradition are interpreted as referring to Muhammad and the Báb, respectively.

<text>The Venta (Latvian pronunciation , Lithuanian , , , Livonian &quot;Vǟnta joug&quot;) is a river in north-western Lithuania and western Latvia. Its source is near Kuršėnai in the Lithuanian Šiauliai County. It flows into the Baltic Sea at Ventspils in Latvia.

On the territory of Lithuania along the Venta are cities Užventis, Kuršėnai, Venta, Viekšniai and Mažeikiai. In Latvia, the cities of Skrunda, Kuldīga, Piltene and Ventspils are located on the Venta river.

Venta Rapid, the widest waterfall in Europe, is on Venta river in Kuldīga, Latvia.

==Basin system==
The river has only one tributary longer than 100 km, the Abava. Other major tributaries include the Virvyčia (99.7 km) and the Varduva (96 km), which flows into the Venta at the Latvia–Lithuania border.

Smaller tributaries include the Avižlys, which runs for 20 kilometers and flows into the Venta River and the 30 kilometre Uogys which joins the Venta less than 1 km upstream of the Avižlys at Akmenė district municipality, Šiauliai County, northern Lithuania.

<doc id="1145321" wikidata="Q6158806" url="?curid=1145321" title="Japanese loanwords in Hawaii">
<text>Loanwords from the Japanese language in Hawaiʻi appear in various parts of the culture. Many loanwords in Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaiian Creole English) derive from the Japanese language. The linguistic influences of the Japanese in Hawaiʻi began with the first immigrants from Japan in 1868 and continues with the large Japanese American population in Hawaiʻi today.

==Background==
There are other Japanese words common among the Japanese American population (such as &quot;okazu&quot; and &quot;obaachan&quot;), but not as well-known among Hawaiʻi&#x27;s general population. Such words have not been included here, nor have Japanese words which have entered the English language on a national level, such as &quot;anime&quot; (), &quot;karaoke&quot; (), &quot;samurai&quot; (), and &quot;sushi&quot; (). Hawaiʻi is also unique in the United States in that Japanese loanwords often retain Japanese pronunciation, as in the tapped &quot;r&quot; sound even in words that have entered the American English dictionary such as &quot;karaoke&quot; and &quot;karate.&quot;

However, as several varieties of Japanese cultural influence in the US in general has increased over the years, it has further bolstered the uses of Japanese terminology in Hawaiʻi. Japanese food has increased in popularity and availability, most notably in the history of sushi in the US and Top Ramen, plus in the 21st century, ramen restaurants. Poke restaurants, centered around the Hawaiian dish, also have food with Japanese influences. Another variety of cultural influence has been the increasing fandom and availability of anime and manga as early as the 1980s with that era&#x27;s Viz Japanese comics in English and &quot;Mangajin&quot; magazine. This fandom brought in the name &quot;cosplay&quot; and expanded its practice in a wider audience. 

Some words are not from the standard Japanese language. They instead originated from Japan&#x27;s regional dialects. For example, the word &quot;bobora&quot; is said to be spoken only in certain prefectures, especially in western Japan where many of the Japanese immigrants came from. It originates from the Portuguese word &quot;abóbora&quot; meaning Japanese pumpkin. 

==Food==

* Anpan (:ja:あんパン, 餡パン): A sweet bread filled with azuki bean paste and sprinkled on top with sesame seeds. Usually larger than the Japanese variety.
* Bentō (:ja:弁当, べんとう): Box lunch geared for portability for picnics, etc. It typically has rice, a main dish of meat or fish, and side dishes. It used to be food on a paper plate placed inside a thin cardboard box. Now, it&#x27;s all in convenient styrofoam containers molded for each dish.
* Furikake: A seaweed and sesame seed based condiment commonly used to season rice.
* Manjū (:ja:饅頭): Confection with sweet azuki bean paste inside a flour-based outside.
* Miso soup (:ja:味噌汁): Soup made of fermented soybean paste called miso. &quot;Miso-shiru&quot; in Japanese.
* Mochi (:ja:餅): Rice cake made of a special kind of rice that has been pounded into a sticky mass. Mochi may be sweetened or unsweetened. Commonly pounded and eaten during New Year&#x27;s, as in Japan. Sweetened azuki beans are commonly included with mochi as part of a confection.
:* Mochi crunch: Rice crackers seasoned with shoyu. Also called &quot;kaki mochi&quot;. Called &quot;arare&quot; in standard Japanese.
:* Mochi ice cream: Ice cream coated with a thin layer of frozen mochi.
* Musubi: Rice triangle wrapped in dried seaweed; may or may not have something in the middle, like a pickled &quot;ume&quot; or bits of fish. Spam musubi has a piece of SPAM luncheon meat on top. In Japanese the word &quot;onigiri&quot; is more commonly used for rice balls. Without further clarification, &quot;musubi&quot; usually implies the triangle variety (round balls of rice are only eaten at funerals).
* Shoyu (:ja:醤油): Soy sauce. &quot;Shoyu rice&quot; is &quot;soy sauce&quot; sprinkled over rice. &quot;Shoyu &quot;x&quot;&quot; is some ingredient &quot;x&quot; cooked in soy sauce, e.g. &quot;Shoyu chicken&quot;, &quot;shoyu pork&quot;, &quot;shoyu tofu&quot;. This term is so widely used that most Hawaii residents are unaware that is not the widely used English language term for soy sauce.
* Sukiyaki (:ja:すき焼き): Thin slices of beef, vegetables, and tofu simmered in a skillet or pan in sukiyaki sauce. (It is also the title of a No. 1 hit song in the U.S. made popular by Kyu Sakamoto in 1963. The Japanese title of the song is &quot;Ue o muite arukō—it has nothing to do with the food product.)
* Teriyaki (:ja:照り焼き): Grilled meat basted with a sauce made of shoyu and sugar. Meat words such as &quot;chicken&quot; are often appended. A common dish in plate lunches. Often shortened to &quot;teri&quot;, e.g. &quot;teri burger&quot;.
* Tako (:ja:タコ): Octopus. Often used in a local dish called poke in which case it is called &quot;tako poke&quot;.

==Objects==
* Benjo (:ja:便所): Toilet, interchangeable with Hawaiian-derived &quot;lua&quot;. Although originally a Japanese word with no particular connotation, in Japan, it is now considered to be crude, and many Japanese people find this term offensive. (See also: Japanese toilet).
* Bobora: A country hick fresh off the boat from Japan. Also called &quot;Japan bobora&quot;. Originally from a regional Japanese dialect, based on the Portuguese word &quot;abóbora&quot;, meaning a Japanese squash.
* Boro boros: Dirty clothes, rags. Old clothes worn for activities like house painting, car repair, etc.
* Chawan cut: A hairstyle that was common among little Japanese girls. It looked like someone put a bowl (茶碗, &quot;chawan&quot;) over the head and cut around the rim. In Japanese, it is called &quot;okappa&quot;, after the Japanese mythological creature called kappa which sports a similar haircut.
* Daikon legs: Daikon (:ja:ダイコン or 大根) are large white radishes having a stubby shape. The term refers to Japanese women&#x27;s legs which seem short and stubby. This is rumored to be the result of sitting on the floor for long periods. The Japanese equivalent is &quot;daikon ashi&quot;.
* Giri-giri: The cowlick. &quot;Giri giri&quot; is an onomatopoeic word with a different meaning in standard Japanese. This use of the word originates from local dialects spoken in mainly western Japan where it means &quot;tsumuji&quot;, the standard Japanese word for the cowlick.
* Hanakuso: Dried nasal mucus. &quot;Hana&quot; means nose, and &quot;kuso&quot; means waste. &quot;Kuso&quot; in Japanese typically refers to human excrement. This compound is also found in standard Japanese.
* Hanabuddah (or hanabata): The fluid version of &quot;hanakuso&quot;. &quot;Bata&quot; is from English &quot;butter&quot;. The term in Japanese is usually &quot;hanamizu&quot; (&quot;nose water&quot;).
* Hanabuddah days: Hanabuddah is most commonly seen on young children who neglect to wipe their runny noses. Thus, hanabuddah days refers to one&#x27;s youth in Hawaiʻi.
* Hashi (also ohashi): Chopsticks, as in Japanese.
* &quot;Kikaida&quot;: After the television series of the same name become enormously popular in Hawaiʻi, &quot;Kikaida&quot; became a generic name for children&#x27;s shows featuring superheroes.
* Shishi: Urine or urination, used in &quot;go shishi&quot; or &quot;make shishi&quot;. The Double-Tongued Dictionary gives three possible etymologies for &quot;shishi&quot;: imitative from the sound of urinating, Japanese reduplicated &quot;shi&quot; from &quot;shiko&quot; &quot;urinate&quot; (sic., probably &quot;shito&quot; 尿 &quot;urine&quot;), or Portuguese &quot;&quot; &quot;urinate&quot;. There is a Japanese kanji joke based on 五-四-四 &quot;5-4-4&quot;, which can be read &quot;go-shi-shi&quot; in Japanese. Thus, “I gotta five-four-four” is a Pidgin euphemism for &quot;I gotta go shishi&quot;.
* Zori: Rubber thonged slippers, often called flip-flops in the continental U.S. Also zoris (plural). Synonymous with &quot;slippers&quot; or &quot;slippahs&quot;. From the Japanese word &quot;zori&quot; (:ja:草履). Called &quot;beach sandal&quot; (:ja:ビーチサンダル) in standard Japanese.

==Miscellaneous==
* Bocha: Take a bath. Originally from &quot;bocha-bocha&quot; Japanese onomatopoeia for splashing noises.
* Bon dance (:ja:盆踊り): From the Japanese Bon Festival. An annual summer dance held outside at Buddhist temples to greet the returning souls of the deceased. They dance in a circle around a tower where people sing and beat taiko drums. The most famous bon dance song is &quot;Tanko-bushi&quot; (炭坑節).
* Buddhahead: Hawaii person of Japanese descent. In this context, “Buddha” is likely a corruption of Japanese “豚 (buta)”, meaning “pig”. In contrast, the term “Katonk” means a Japanese-American from the US mainland.
* Habut/Habuteru: To feel grumpy or resentful, especially after feeling offended by something. Not standard Japanese but from Hiroshima dialect.
* Jan ken po: The children&#x27;s game of rock (fist), paper (open hand), and scissors (peace sign). In Japanese, either &quot;jan ken&quot; or &quot;jan ken pon&quot;. The Japanese also do not say the prelude as used in Hawaiʻi (&quot;janken na manken an saka saka po ...&quot;) before they show their hands. This jan-ken-po prelude can also differ depending on the island and is mainly used by children.

* Shibai: A false act. Often refers to politicians or other influential persons who put on a false face. From the Japanese word &quot;shibai&quot;, meaning &quot;a (theatre) play.&quot;
* Skebe: Horny. From Japanese &quot;sukebe&quot;. In Japanese, &quot;H&quot; (&quot;ecchi&quot;) is used for the same purpose, and &quot;sukebe&quot; refers to a pervert.
* Skosh: Just a little. From Japanese &quot;sukoshi&quot; &quot;a little&quot;.

<doc id="1145326" wikidata="Q1723544" url="?curid=1145326" title="2006 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 2006 Canadian federal election was held on January 23, 2006, to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 39th Parliament of Canada.

New details of the sponsorship scandal were released through the Gomery Commission, and the three opposition parties aimed to bring down Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s minority government, contending that it was corrupt. On November 28, 2005, Martin&#x27;s government was defeated on a motion of non-confidence. A day later, Martin met with Governor General Michaëlle Jean to dissolve parliament, triggering an unusual winter election.

The Conservative Party, that was formed in 2003 from the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance, scored its first-ever victory as they won the greatest number of seats in the House of Commons, winning 124 out of 308, up from 99 seats in 2004. Due to the emerging details of the sponsorship scandal, as well as a unified right-of-centre party, the Tories led by Stephen Harper went on to end over 12 years of Liberal rule. Harper formed the smallest minority government in Canadian history (in terms of proportion of seats), becoming prime minister. The New Democratic Party experienced a modest boost in support whereas the Bloc Québécois&#x27; seat count nearly stayed the same. This is the most recent election in which the winning federal party did not win New Brunswick and Ontario.

== Cause of the election ==
This unusual winter general election was caused by a motion of no confidence passed by the House of Commons on November 28, 2005, with Canada&#x27;s three opposition parties contending that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin was corrupt. The following morning Martin met with Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who then dissolved parliament, summoned the next parliament, and ordered the issuance of writs of election. The last set January 23, 2006, as election day and February 13 as the date for return of the writs. The campaign was almost eight weeks in length, the longest in two decades, in order to allow time for the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Recent political events, most notably testimony to the Gomery Commission investigating the sponsorship scandal, significantly weakened the Liberals (who, under Martin, had formed the first Liberal minority government since the Trudeau era) by allegations of criminal corruption in the party. The first Gomery report, released November 1, 2005, had found a &quot;culture of entitlement&quot; to exist within the Government. Although the next election was not legally required until 2009, the opposition had enough votes to force the dissolution of Parliament earlier. While Prime Minister Martin had committed in April 2005 to dissolve Parliament within a month of the tabling of the second Gomery Report (which was released on schedule on February 1, 2006), all three opposition parties—the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois, and New Democratic Party (NDP)—and three of the four independents decided that the issue at hand was how to correct the Liberal corruption, and the motion of non-confidence passed 171–133. 

== Parties ==
Most observers believed only the Liberals and the Conservatives were capable of forming a government in this election, although Canadian political history is not without examples of wholly unexpected outcomes, such as Ontario&#x27;s provincial election in 1990. However, with the exception of the Unionist government of 1917 (which combined members of both the Conservatives and the Liberals), at the Federal stage, only Liberals or Conservatives have formed government. With the end of the campaign at hand, pollsters and pundits placed the Conservatives ahead of the Liberals.

Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberals hoped to recapture their majority, and this appeared likely at one point during the campaign; but it would have required holding back Bloc pressure in Quebec plus picking up some new seats there while also gaining seats in English Canada, most likely in rural Ontario and southwestern British Columbia. Towards the end of the campaign, even high-profile Liberals were beginning to concede defeat, and the best the Liberals could have achieved was a razor-thin minority.

Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives succeeded in bringing their new party into power in Canada. While continuing weaknesses in Quebec and urban areas rightfully prompted most observers to consider a Conservative majority government to be mathematically difficult to achieve, early on, Harper&#x27;s stated goal was to achieve one nonetheless. Though the Conservatives were ahead of the Liberals in Quebec, they remained far behind the Bloc Québécois, and additional gains in rural and suburban Ontario would have been necessary to meet Stephen Harper&#x27;s goal. The polls had remained pretty well static over the course of December, with the real shift coming in the first few days of the New Year. That is when the Conservatives took the lead and kept it for the rest of the campaign.

Harper started off the first month of the campaign with a policy-per-day strategy, which included a GST reduction and a child-care allowance. The Liberals opted to hold any major announcements until after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the campaign and was able to define his platform and insulate it from expected Liberal attacks. On December 27, 2005, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced it was investigating allegations that Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale&#x27;s office had engaged in insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. The RCMP indicated that they had no evidence of wrongdoing or criminal activity from any party associated with the investigation, including Goodale. However, the story dominated news coverage for the following week and prevented the Liberals from making their key policy announcements, allowing the Conservatives to refocus their previous attacks about corruption within the Liberal party. The Conservatives soon found themselves leading in the polls. By early January, they made a major breakthrough in Quebec, pushing the Liberals to second place.

As their lead solidified, media coverage of the Conservatives was much more positive, while Liberals found themselves increasingly criticized for running a poor campaign and making numerous gaffes.

The NDP has claimed that last minute tactical voting cost them several seats last time, as left-of-centre voters moved to the Liberals so that they could prevent a Harper-led government. Jack Layton avoided stating his party&#x27;s goal was to win the election outright, instead calling for enough New Democrats to be elected to hold the balance of power in a Liberal or Conservative minority government. Political commentators have long argued that the NDP&#x27;s main medium-term goal is to serve as junior partners to the Liberals in Canada&#x27;s first-ever true coalition government. NDP leader Jack Layton was concerned last time over people voting Liberal so that they could avoid a Conservative government. Over the course of the last week of the campaign, Jack Layton called on Liberal voters disgusted with the corruption to &quot;lend&quot; their votes to the NDP to elect more NDP members to the House and hold the Conservatives to a minority.

The Bloc Québécois had a very successful result in the 2004 election, with the Liberals reduced to the core areas of federalist support in portions of Montreal and the Outaouais. Oddly enough, this meant that there were comparatively few winnable Bloc seats left—perhaps eight or so—for the party to target. With provincial allies the Parti Québécois widely tipped to regain power in 2007, a large sovereigntist contingent in the House could play a major role in reopening the matter of Quebec independence. The Bloc Québécois only runs candidates in the province of Quebec. However, Gilles Duceppe&#x27;s dream of winning 50%+ of the popular vote was dashed when the polls broke after the New Year, and the Conservatives became a real threat to that vision in Quebec.

In addition to the four sitting parties, the Green Party of Canada ran candidates in all 308 federal ridings for the second consecutive election. Though the Greens had been an official party since the 1984 election, this campaign was the first in which they had stable financial support with which to campaign. After a breakthrough in the 2004 election, they exceeded the minimum 2% of the popular vote to receive federal funding. Supporters and sympathisers criticize that the party were not invited to the nationally televised debates even with its official status. The party has occasionally polled as high as 19% in British Columbia and 11% nationwide. Critics of the Green Party contend that, by drawing away left-of-centre votes, the Green Party actually assists the Conservative Party in some ridings. The Greens deny this.

Other parties are listed in the table of results above.

== Events during the 38th Parliament ==
An early election seemed likely because the 2004 federal election, held on June 28, 2004, resulted in the election of a Liberal minority government. In the past, minority governments have had an average lifespan of a year and a half. Some people considered the 38th parliament to be particularly unstable. It involved four parties, and only very implausible ideological combinations (e.g., Liberals + Conservatives; Liberals + BQ; Conservatives + BQ + NDP) could actually command a majority of the seats, a necessity if a government is to retain power. From its earliest moments, there was some threat of the government falling as even the Speech from the Throne almost resulted in a non-confidence vote.

=== Brinkmanship in the spring of 2005 ===
The Liberal government came close to falling when testimony from the Gomery Commission caused public opinion to move sharply against the government. The Bloc Québécois were eager from the beginning to have an early election. The Conservatives announced they had also lost confidence in the government&#x27;s moral authority. Thus, during much of spring 2005, there was a widespread belief that the Liberals would lose a confidence vote, prompting an election taking place in the spring or summer of 2005.

In a televised speech on April 21, Martin promised to request a dissolution of Parliament and begin an election campaign within 30 days of the Gomery Commission&#x27;s final report. The release date of that report would later solidify as February 1, 2006; Martin then clarified that he intended to schedule the election call so as to have the polling day in April 2006.

Later that week, the NDP, who had initially opposed the budget, opted to endorse Martin&#x27;s proposal for a later election. The Liberals agreed to take corporate tax cuts out of the budget on April 26 in exchange for NDP support on votes of confidence, but even with NDP support the Liberals still fell three votes short of a majority. However, a surprise defection of former Conservative leadership candidate Belinda Stronach to the Liberal party on May 17 changed the balance of power in the House. Independents Chuck Cadman and Carolyn Parrish provided the last two votes needed for the Liberals to win the budget vote.

The deal turned out to be rather unnecessary, as the Conservatives opted to ensure the government&#x27;s survival on the motion of confidence surrounding the original budget, expressing support to the tax cuts and defence spending therein. When Parliament voted on second reading and referral of the budget and the amendment on May 19, the previous events kept the government alive. The original budget bill, C-43, passed easily, as expected, but the amendment bill, C-48, resulted in an equality of votes, and the Speaker of the House broke the tie to continue the parliament. The government never got as close to falling after that date. Third reading of Bill C-48 was held late at night on an unexpected day, and several Conservatives being absent, the motion passed easily, guaranteeing there would be no election in the near future.

=== Aftermath of the first Gomery report ===
On November 1, John Gomery released his interim report, and the scandal returned to prominence. Liberal support again fell, with some polls registering an immediate ten percent drop. The Conservatives and Bloc thus resumed their push for an election before Martin&#x27;s April date. The NDP stated that their support was contingent on the Liberals agreeing to move against the private provision of healthcare. The Liberals and NDP failed to come to an agreement, however, and the NDP joined the two other opposition parties in demanding an election.

However, the Liberals had intentionally scheduled the mandatory &quot;opposition days&quot; (where a specified opposition party controls the agenda) on November 15 (Conservative), November 17 (Bloc Québécois) and November 24 (NDP). These days meant that any election would come over the Christmas season, an unpopular idea. Following negotiations between the opposition parties, they instead issued an ultimatum to the Prime Minister to call an election immediately after the Christmas holidays or face an immediate non-confidence vote which would prompt a holiday-spanning campaign.

To that end, the NDP introduced a parliamentary motion demanding that the government drop the writ in January 2006 for a February 13 election date; however, only the prime minister has the authority to advise the Governor General on an election date, the government was therefore not bound by the NDP&#x27;s motion. Martin had indicated that he remained committed to his April 2006 date, and would disregard the motion, which the opposition parties managed to pass, as expected, on November 21 by a vote of 167–129.

The three opposition leaders had agreed to delay the tabling of the no-confidence motion until the 24th, to ensure that a conference between the government and aboriginal leaders scheduled on the 24th would not be disrupted by the campaign. Parliamentary procedure dictated that the vote be deferred until the 28th. Even if the opposition had not put forward the non-confidence motion, the government was still expected to fall—there was to have been a vote on supplementary budget estimates on December 8, and if it had been defeated, loss of Supply would have toppled the Liberals.

Conservative leader Stephen Harper, the leader of the Opposition, introduced a motion of no confidence on November 24, which NDP leader Jack Layton seconded. The motion was voted upon and passed in the evening of November 28, with all present MPs from the NDP, Bloc Québécois, and Conservatives and 3 Independents (Bev Desjarlais, David Kilgour and Pat O&#x27;Brien), voting with a combined strength of 171 votes for the motion and 132 Liberals and one Independent (Carolyn Parrish) voting against. One Bloc Québécois MP was absent from the vote. It is the fifth time a Canadian government has lost the confidence of Parliament, but the first time this has happened on a straight motion of no confidence. The four previous instances have been due to loss of supply or votes of censure.

Martin visited Governor General Michaëlle Jean the following morning, where he formally advised her to dissolve Parliament and schedule an election for January 23. In accordance with Canadian constitutional practice, she consented (such a request has only been turned down once in Canadian history), officially beginning an election campaign that had been simmering for months.

Early on in the campaign, polls showed the Liberals with a solid 5–10 point lead over the Conservatives, and poised to form a strong minority government at worst. Around Christmas, after reports of an RCMP investigation into allegations of insider trading within the Finance department, this situation changed dramatically, leading to the opposition parties to consistently attack the Liberals on corruption. Almost at the same time, the Boxing Day shooting, an unusually violent gun fight between rival gangs on December 26 in downtown Toronto (resulting in the death of 15-year-old Jane Creba, an innocent bystander), may have swayed some Ontario voters to support the more hardline CPC policies on crime. The Conservatives enjoyed a fairly significant lead in polls leading up to the election, but the gap narrowed in the last few days.

== Issues ==

Several issues—some long-standing (notably fiscal imbalance, the gun registry, abortion, and Quebec sovereigntism), others recently brought forth by media coverage (including redressing the Chinese Canadian community for long-standing wrongs that forced both parties to back-track on their position in the national and ethnic media, particularly in key British Columbia and Alberta ridings), or court decisions (the sponsorship scandal, same-sex marriages, income trusts, or Canada–United States relations)—took the fore in debate among the parties and also influenced aspects of the parties&#x27; electoral platforms.

Elections Canada later investigated improper election spending by the Conservative Party, which became widely known as the In and Out scandal. In 2011, charges against senior Conservatives were dropped in a plea deal that saw the party and its fundraising arm plead guilty and receive the maximum possible fines, totaling $52,000.

== Opinion polls ==


Prior to and during the election campaign, opinion polling showed variable support for the governing Liberals and opposition Conservatives. In November 2005, the first report by Justice John Gomery was released to the public; subsequently, poll numbers for the Liberals again dropped. Just days later, polling showed the Liberals were already bouncing back; upon the election call, the Liberals held a small lead over the Conservatives and maintained this for much of December. Renewed accusations of corruption and impropriety at the end of 2005 – amid Royal Canadian Mounted Police criminal probes of possible government leaks regarding income trust tax changes and advertising sponsorships – led to an upswing of Conservative support again and gave them a lead over the Liberals, portending a change in government. Ultimately this scandal was linked to a blackberry exchange to a banking official by Liberal candidate Scott Brison. Polling figures for the NDP increased slightly, while Bloc figures experienced a slight dip; figures for the Green Party did not change appreciably throughout the campaign.

== Exit poll ==
An exit poll was carried out by Ipsos Reid polling firm. The poll overestimated the NDP&#x27;s support and underestimated the Liberals&#x27; support. Here is a results breakdown by demographics:
== Candidates ==
The election involved the same 308 electoral districts as in 2004, except in New Brunswick, where the boundary between Acadie—Bathurst and Miramichi was ruled to be illegal. Many of the candidates were also the same: fewer incumbents chose to leave than if they had served a full term, and the parties have generally blocked challenges to sitting MPs for the duration of the minority government, although there had been some exceptions.

=== Gender breakdown of candidates ===
An ongoing issue in Canadian politics is the imbalance between the genders in selection by political parties of candidates. Although in the past some parties, particularly the New Democrats, have focused on the necessity of having equal gender representation in Parliament, no major party has ever nominated as many or more women than men in a given election. In 2006, the New Democrats had the highest percentage of female candidates (35.1%) of any party aside from the Animal Alliance, which only had one candidate, its leader, Liz White. The proportion of female New Democrats elected was greater than the proportion nominated, indicating female New Democrats were nominated in winnable ridings. 12.3% of Conservative candidates and 25.6% of Liberal candidates were female.



== Campaign slogans ==
The parties&#x27; campaign slogans for the 2006 election:

== Endorsements ==
== Target ridings ==
== Incumbent MPs who did not run for re-election ==
==Electoral district changes==
The following name changes were made to the electoral districts after the 2004 election:

In 2005, further changes were made:

:* Battle River and Kitchener—Wilmot—Wellesley—Woolwich reverted to their prior names, following passage of two private member&#x27;s bills.
:* A minor boundary adjustment was made between Acadie—Bathurst and Miramichi.

== Results ==

The election was held on January 23, 2006. The first polls closed at 7:00 p.m. ET (0000 UTC); Elections Canada started to publish preliminary results on its website at 10:00 p.m. ET as the last polls closed. Harper was reelected in Calgary Southwest, which he has held since 2002, ensuring that he had a seat in the new parliament. Shortly after midnight (ET) that night, incumbent Prime Minister Paul Martin conceded defeat, and announced that he would resign as leader of the Liberal Party. At 9:30 a.m. on January 24, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would not form a government and intended to resign as Prime Minister. Later that day, at 6:45 p.m., Jean invited Harper to form a government. Martin formally resigned and Harper was formally appointed and sworn in as Prime Minister on February 6.

Choosing not to take on the office of Leader of the Opposition, the first defeated Prime Minister who had retained his seat not to do so, Martin stepped down as parliamentary leader of his party on February 1, and the Liberal caucus appointed Bill Graham, MP for Toronto Centre and outgoing Defence Minister, as his interim successor. It was announced a month later that there would be a Liberal leadership convention later in the year, during which Stéphane Dion won the leadership of the Liberal Party. Martin continued to sit as a Member of Parliament representing LaSalle—Émard, the Montreal-area riding he had held since 1988, until his retirement in 2008.

=== Overall results ===
The elections resulted in a Conservative minority government with 124 seats in parliament with a Liberal opposition and a strengthened NDP. In his speech following the loss, Martin stated he would not lead the Liberal Party of Canada in another election. Preliminary results indicated that 64.9% of registered voters cast a ballot, a notable increase over 2004&#x27;s 60.9%.

The NDP won new seats in British Columbia and Ontario as their overall popular vote increased 2% from 2004. The Bloc managed to win almost as many seats as in 2004 despite losing a significant percentage of the vote. Most of the Conservatives&#x27; gains were in rural Ontario and Quebec as they took a net loss in the west, but won back the only remaining Liberal seat in Alberta. The popular vote of the Conservatives and Liberals were almost the mirror image of 2004, though the Conservatives were not able to translate this into as many seats as the Liberals did in 2004.

A judicial recount was automatically scheduled in the Parry Sound-Muskoka riding, where early results showed Conservative Tony Clement only 21 votes ahead of Liberal Andy Mitchell, because the difference of votes cast between the two leading candidates was less than 0.1%. Clement was confirmed as the winner by 28 votes.

Conservative candidate Jeremy Harrison, narrowly defeated by Liberal Gary Merasty in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River by 72 votes, alleged electoral fraud but decided not to pursue the matter. A judicial recount was ordered in the riding, which certified Gary Merasty the winner by a reduced margin of 68 votes.

===Synopsis of results===

: = went to a judicial recount
: = Open seat
: = turnout is above national average
: = Incumbent had switched allegiance
: = Previously incumbent in another riding
: = Not incumbent; was previously elected to the House
: = Incumbency arose from by-election gain

<doc id="1145328" wikidata="Q4115400" url="?curid=1145328" title="Metal fabrication">
<text>Metal fabrication is the creation of metal structures by cutting, bending and assembling processes. It is a value-added process involving the creation of machines, parts, and structures from various raw materials. 

Typically, a fabrication shop bids on a job, usually based on engineering drawings, and if awarded the contract, builds the product. Large fab shops employ a multitude of value-added processes, including welding, cutting, forming and machining. 

As with other manufacturing processes, both human labor and automation are commonly used. A fabricated product may be called a &quot;fabrication&quot;, and shops specializing in this type of work are called &quot;fab shops&quot;. The end products of other common types of metalworking, such as machining, metal stamping, forging, and casting, may be similar in shape and function, but those processes are not classified as fabrication.

==Processes==
*&quot;Cutting&quot; is done by sawing, shearing, or chiselling (all with manual and powered variants); torching with handheld torches (such as oxy-fuel torches or plasma torches); and via numerical control (CNC) cutters (using a laser, mill bits, torch, or water jet).
*&quot;Bending&quot; is done by hammering (manual or powered) or via press brakes, tube benders and similar tools. Modern metal fabricators use press brakes to coin or air-bend metal sheet into form. CNC-controlled backgauges use hard stops to position cut parts to place bend lines in specific positions.
* &quot;Assembling&quot; (joining of pieces) is done by welding, binding with adhesives, riveting, threaded fasteners, or further bending in the form of crimped seams. Structural steel and sheet metal are the usual materials for fabrication; welding wire, flux and/or fasteners are used to join the cut pieces. 

Fabrication comprises or overlaps with various metalworking specialties:

* Fabrication shops and machine shops have overlapping capabilities, but fabrication shops generally concentrate on metal preparation and assembly (as described above). Machine shops cut metal, but focus primarily on the machining of parts on machine tools. Some firms do both fab work and machining.
* Blacksmithing has always involved fabrication, although that term has not always been used.
*Welder-produced products, often referred to as &quot;weldments&quot;, are examples of fabrication.
* Boilermakers originally specialized in fabricating boilers, but the term is now used more broadly.
*Millwrights originally specialized in setting up grain mills and saw mills, but now perform a wide range of fabrication.
* Ironworkers, also known as steel erectors, also engage in fabrication. They often work with prefabricated segments, produced in fab shops, that are delivered to the site.

== Raw materials ==
Standard metal fabrication materials are:
*Plate metal
*Formed and expanded metal
**Tube stock
*Welding wire/welding rod
*Casting

== Cutting and burning ==
A variety of tools are used to cut raw material. The most common cutting method is shearing.

Special band saws for cutting metal have hardened blades and feed mechanisms for even cutting. Abrasive cut-off saws, also known as chop saws, are similar to miter saws but have a steel-cutting abrasive disks. Cutting torches can cut large sections of steel with little effort.

Burn tables are CNC (computer-operated) cutting torches, usually powered by natural gas. Plasma and laser cutting tables, and water jet cutters, are also common. Plate steel is loaded on the table and the parts are cut out as programmed. The support table consists of a grid of bars that can be replaced when worn. Higher-end burn tables may include CNC punch capability using a carousel of punches and taps. In fabrication of structural steel by plasma and laser cutting, robots move the cutting head in three dimensions around the cut material.

== Forming ==
Forming converts flat sheet metal into 3-D parts by applying force without adding or removing material. The force must be great enough to change the metal&#x27;s initial shape. Forming can be controlled with tools such as punches and dies. Machinery can regulate force magnitude and direction. Machine-based forming can combine forming and welding to produce lengths of fabricated sheeting (e.g. linear grating for water drainage). Most metallic materials, being at least somewhat ductile and capable of considerable permanent deformation without cracking or breaking, lend themselves particularly well to these techniques.

Proper design and use of tools with machinery creates a repeatable form that can be used to create products for many industries, including jewelry, aerospace, automotive, construction, civil and architectural.

== Machining == 
Machining is a specialized trade of removing material from a block of metal to make it a desired shape. Fab shops generally have some machining capability, using metal lathes, mills, drills, and other portable machining tools. Most solid components, such as gears, bolts, screws and nuts, are machined.

== Welding ==
Welding is the main focus of steel fabrication. Formed and machined parts are assembled and tack-welded in place, then rechecked for accuracy. If multiple weldments have been ordered, a fixture may be used to locate parts for welding. A welder then finishes the work according to engineering drawings (for detailed welding) or by their own experience and judgement (if no details are provided).

Special measures may be needed to prevent or correct of weldments due to heat. These may include redesigning the piece to require less welding, employing staggered welding, using a stout fixture, covering the weldment in sand as it cools, and post-weld straightening.

Straightening of warped steel weldments is done with an oxyacetylene torch. In this highly specialized work, heat is selectively applied to the steel in a slow, linear sweep, causing the steel to contract in the direction of the sweep as it cools. A highly skilled welder can remove significant warpage this way.

Steel weldments are occasionally annealed in a low-temperature oven to relieve residual stresses. Such weldments, particularly those for engine blocks, may be line-bored after heat treatment.

After the weldment has cooled, seams are usually ground clean, and the assembly can be sandblasted, primed and painted. Any additional manufacturing is then performed, and the finished product is inspected and shipped.

<text>The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get is the second studio album by American rock guitarist and singer Joe Walsh, released in 1973 by ABC-Dunhill Records in the United States and the United Kingdom, and was also released in Germany. It proved to be his commercial breakthrough, largely on the strength of the Top 40 hit single, &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;, which helped propel the album into the Top 10.

On this album, Walsh shares the vocals and songwriting with the other three members of Barnstorm: drummer/multi-instrumentalist Joe Vitale, bassist Kenny Passarelli, and new member, keyboardist Rocke Grace. As a result, a variety of styles are explored on this album; there are elements of blues, jazz, folk, pop, and even Caribbean music. However, the album is only credited to Walsh as a solo artist, not to Barnstorm, which led to the band&#x27;s demise. After the success of this album, Walsh continued making albums as a solo artist.

==Cover artwork==
The cover art for the album features a First World War era British Sopwith Snipe fighter plane, with fanciful coloration.

==Critical reception==

Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Ben Davies wrote of the album &quot;Walsh&#x27;s ability to swing wildly from one end of the rock scale to the other is unparalleled and makes for an album to suit many tastes... [it] features some of the most remembered Joe Walsh tracks, but it&#x27;s not just these that make the album a success. Each of the nine tracks is a song to be proud of. This is a superb album by anyone&#x27;s standards.&quot;

==Release history==
In addition to the usual two channel stereo version this album was also released in a four channel quadraphonic edition on LP and 8-track tape in 1974. The quad LP is encoded using the QS Regular Matrix system. Audio Fidelity issued a limited 24-karat gold edition CD in 2009. This was followed in 2011 by a version in Japan with a miniature replica of the original sleeve in the SHM-CD format.

<text>&quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (originally known as &quot;Carol of the Drum&quot;) is a popular Christmas song written by American composer Katherine Kennicott Davis in 1941. First recorded in 1951 by the Austrian Trapp Family, the song was further popularized by a 1958 recording by the Harry Simeone Chorale; the Simeone version was re-released successfully for several years, and the song has been recorded many times since.

In the lyrics, the singer relates how, as a poor young boy, he was summoned by the Magi to the Nativity of Jesus. Without a gift for the Infant, the little drummer boy played his drum with approval from Jesus&#x27;s mother, Mary, recalling, &quot;I played my best for him&quot; and &quot;He smiled at me&quot;. The story of a drummer at the manger is not from the Bible.

==Origins and history==
The song was originally titled &quot;Carol of the Drum&quot;. While speculation has been made that the song is very loosely based on the Czech carol &quot;Hajej, nynej&quot;, Claire Fontijn, the chair of the music department at Davis&#x27;s alma mater Wellesley College claims otherwise.

Davis&#x27;s interest was in producing material for amateur and girls&#x27; choirs: Her manuscript is set as a chorale, in which the tune is in the soprano melody with alto harmony, tenor and bass parts producing the &quot;drum rhythm&quot; and a keyboard accompaniment &quot;for rehearsal only&quot;. It is headed &quot;Czech Carol freely transcribed by K.K.D.&quot;, these initials then crossed out and replaced with &quot;C.R.W. Robinson&quot;, a name under which Davis sometimes published.

&quot;Carol of the Drum&quot; appealed to the Austrian Trapp Family Singers, who first brought the song to wider prominence when they recorded it for Decca Records in 1951 on their first album for the label. Their version was credited solely to Davis and published by Belwin-Mills.
In 1957, the song was recorded with an altered arrangement by Jack Halloran for his Jack Halloran Singers on their Dot Records album &quot;Christmas Is A-Comin&quot;&#x27;. This arrangement is the one commonly sung today. However, the recording was not released as a single that year. In response to this, Dot producer Henry Onorati, who left Dot to become the new head of 20th Century-Fox Records in 1958, introduced the song to Harry Simeone. When 20th Century-Fox Records contracted with Simeone to record a Christmas album, Simeone hired many of the same singers who had sung in Halloran&#x27;s version and made a near-identical recording with his newly created Harry Simeone Chorale. It was released as a single in 1958, and later on the album, &quot;Sing We Now of Christmas&quot;, later retitled &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. The only difference between Simeone&#x27;s and Halloran&#x27;s versions was that Simeone&#x27;s contained finger cymbals, and the song&#x27;s title had been changed to &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. Simeone and Onorati claimed and received joint composition credits with Davis, although the two did not actually compose or arrange it. Halloran never received a joint writing credit for the song, something his family disagrees with.

The album and the song were an enormous success, with the single scoring in the top 40 of the U.S. music charts from 1958 to 1962. In 1965, Simeone, who had signed with Kapp Records in 1964, re-recorded a new version of the song for his album &quot;O&#x27; Bambino: The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. This version (3:18 play time) was recorded in stereo, had a slightly slower tempo, and contained different-sounding cymbals. Simeone recorded the song a third and final time in 1981 (3:08 play time), for an album, again titled &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, on the budget Holiday Records label.

==Renditions==

&quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; has been recorded by many artists:
* Ray Conniff as the lead song on his 1962 album We Wish You a Merry Christmas.
* Bert Kaempfert as the lead song on his 1963 album Christmas Wonderland.
* Frank Sinatra covered the song on the 1964 album &quot;12 Songs of Christmas&quot;.
* In Spain, the song &quot;&quot; is associated with Raphael, who sang it for the first time in 1965 for a TVE Christmas special.
* Vince Guaraldi as the 3rd track, titled “My Little Drum”, on his 1965 album &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.
* Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, whose version got to No. 13 in the UK charts at Christmas 1972
* Jazz/funk musician Stix Hooper, drummer and percussionist for the group The Crusaders, who recorded the song in 1979 as the final track on &quot;The World Within&quot;, his first album as a lead artist.
* Pop group Boney M., who recorded a version of the song for their 1981 &quot;Christmas Album&quot;. The single peaked at No. 20 in Germany.
* Also in 1981, a pop punk/hard rock version served as the final track on Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&#x27;s album &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;. Jett&#x27;s version includes a return of the traditional lyrics of &quot;ass and lamb&quot; instead of &quot;ox and lamb&quot;, and another line, traditionally &quot;Mary nodded&quot;, is rendered in apparent nonsense words. Besides these and a climactic electric guitar breakdown, the song is otherwise performed fairly earnestly.
* A duet by the unusual pairing of Bing Crosby and David Bowie on Crosby&#x27;s final holiday TV special (&quot;Bing Crosby&#x27;s Merrie Olde Christmas&quot;, 1977) as a medley titled &quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot;. In 1982 it reached No. 3 on the UK chart.
* Ringo Starr included a version of the song on his 1999 holiday album &quot;I Wanna Be Santa Claus.&quot;
* Terry Wogan and Aled Jones recorded a cover of the 1977 David Bowie/Bing Crosby duet, &quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot;; after a brief campaign amongst listeners of BBC Radio 2 instigated by Chris Evans to get the song released in support of the Children in Need charity, it was released as a single on 8 December 2008, reaching No. 3 in the UK Top 40 singles chart.
* Norwegian electronic musician Hans-Peter Lindstrøm recorded a 42-minute version of the song in 2009. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed it at number 20 on their list of the 50 greatest Christmas songs.
* Justin Bieber released a version of the song, simply named &quot;Drummer Boy&quot;, with Busta Rhymes on his 2011 Christmas album, &quot;Under the Mistletoe&quot;, adding rap verses. The song is listed among the Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs chart by &quot;Billboard&quot;.
* Pentatonix released it as a digital single, in 2013, which both debuted and peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.
* The band For King &amp; Country recorded a popular version of the song in which they featured on their 2017 live album &quot;&quot;, as well as a studio version of the song from their 2020 album &quot;A Drummer Boy Christmas&quot;, which was nominated and won a GMA Dove Award for Christmas / Special Event Album of the Year.

<text>Sam Houston Jones State Park is a park near the city of Lake Charles, Calcasieu Parish, in southwestern Louisiana (USA), located where the Houston River joins the Calcasieu River and Indian Bayou. It consists of of woodlands, lakes and rivers. Prominent in the park are many bald cypress trees. Tree-filled lagoons and a mixed pine and hardwood forest combine to create a unique natural environment. The area hosts an abundance of wildlife, including deer, squirrels, bobcats, rabbits, alligators, otters, nutria rats, raccoons, foxes and diverse bird life. Ducks and geese are usually found swimming in the ponds.

Originally named for Sam Houston, the Texas folk hero who traveled extensively in the western reaches of Louisiana, its current name is in honor of the former Louisiana governor Sam Houston Jones, who was instrumental in setting aside this tract of land for the public to enjoy. Facilities include campsites, cabins, a boat launch, rental boats, a scenic picnic area with pavilions, a playground and restrooms.

The site is located in the Central Migratory Flyway and just north of the most productive birding region in Louisiana. In the spring and fall, migratory patterns bring nearly 200 bird species within of the park site.

The numerous waterways in this area make water sports a natural highlight at the park. Two boat launches are conveniently located on the West Fork of the Calcasieu River, providing access to the Gulf of Mexico, only a few miles away. Rental boats are available those who simply wish to take in the serene beauty of the park&#x27;s ponds or for fishing.

The three hiking trails winding through this beautiful park make strolling or serious hiking, pleasurable. Hikers may visit the old stagecoach road to explore the park and the banks of the various tributaries to the Calcasieu River.

Hours of Operation are 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday to Thursday. All park sites close at 10 p.m. on Friday, on Saturdays and days preceding holidays.

<doc id="1145345" wikidata="Q423401" url="?curid=1145345" title="Isosorbide mononitrate">
<text>Isosorbide mononitrate, sold under many brand names, is a medication used for heart-related chest pain (angina), heart failure and esophageal spasms. It can be used both to treat and to prevent heart-related chest pain; however, it is generally less preferred than beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure with standing, blurry vision, and skin flushing. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure especially if also exposed to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. Use is not recommended in pregnancy. It is believed to work by relaxing smooth muscle within blood vessels.
It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, isosorbide was the 119th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate-class drug used for the prevention of angina pectoris. The sublingual patch has an onset of five minutes and a duration of action of one hour. The oral, slow release tablet has an onset of thirty minutes, and a duration of 8 hours. 

==Adverse effects==
The following adverse effects have been reported in studies with isosorbide mononitrate:

Very common: Headache predominates (up to 30%) necessitating withdrawal of 2 to 3% of patients, but the incidence reduces rapidly as treatment continues.

Common: Tiredness, sleep disturbances (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) have been reported during clinical trials with isosorbide mononitrate modified-release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%)

Adverse effects associated with the clinical use of the drug are as expected with all nitrate preparations. They occur mainly in the early stages of treatment.

Hypotension (4%) with symptoms such as dizziness and nausea (1%) have been reported. In general, these symptoms disappear during long-term treatment.

Other reactions that have been reported with isosorbide mononitrate-modified release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo, and heartburn.

==Interactions==
* Sildenafil (Viagra). Concomitant administration of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate with the potential result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy.
* Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The metabolism of organic nitrates to nitric oxide is dependent on the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with angina pectoris and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with isosorbide mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and captopril may produce a similar interaction.
* Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. The addition of a calcium channel blocker of the verapamil type, such as gallopamil 75 mg, has been shown to further improve left ventricular functional parameters when given in combination with isosorbide mononitrate in a sustained-release formulation.
* Propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate to propranolol treatment in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension caused a marked fall in portal pressure, a reduction in hepatic blood flow, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure, but no additional change in azygos blood flow. The additional effect of isosorbide mononitrate was especially evident in patients whose portal pressure was not reduced by propranolol.
* Calcium antagonists (general). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium antagonists and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agent may be necessary.

==Brand names==
It is sold in the US by Lannett Company, under the brand name Monoket, and was also sold in the US under the name Imdur, and marketed in the UK under the trade names: Isotard, Monosorb, Chemydur. In India, this drug is available under the brand names of Ismo, Imdur, Isonorm, Monotrate, Solotrate, and Monit. In Russia it is occasionally used under the brand names Monocinque and Pektrol. In Australia, this drug is available under the brand name Duride.

<doc id="1145346" wikidata="Q342530" url="?curid=1145346" title="Mikael Forssell">
<text>Mikael Kaj Forssell (born 15 March 1981) is a Finnish former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is currently working as an assistant coach of HJK Helsinki, having previously worked as a youth coach for the club.

Forssell began his professional career in 1997 for HJK, having progressed through the team&#x27;s youth teams, but he only remained at the club for a single season, making 17 league appearances, before he moved to England to join Chelsea in 1998. He never broke into the Chelsea team, making 33 league appearances in seven years, and spent two loan spells at Crystal Palace, one at Borussia Mönchengladbach, and two at Birmingham City. He switched permanently to the latter club in 2005, but injury problems restricted him to 65 league appearances in three seasons. He joined German side Hannover 96 in July 2008 on a free transfer, but once again struggled with form and injury problems, and he left the club in 2011, having made 44 league appearances. This was followed by an unsuccessful season back in England, this time with Leeds United; 15 league games failed to yield a single goal. Forssell returned to HJK in October 2012.

Forssell made his full international debut for Finland in 1999, and was a regular player for his country for the next 15 years. He earned 87 caps for his country, and scored 29 goals, making him Finland&#x27;s sixth most capped player and second highest goalscorer.

On 2 October 2022, Forssell was named in the HJK Hall of Fame.

==Club career==
Born in Steinfurt, Germany, and considered one of the most talented Finnish footballers of all time, Forssell made his Veikkausliiga debut for HJK at the age of just 16.

===Chelsea===
His goal-scoring form for Finland&#x27;s youth teams made him a target for a host of Europe&#x27;s top clubs, and in 1998, the 17-year-old striker was snapped up by Chelsea who at the time were managed by Gianluca Vialli. He made his debut as a substitute in a league game against Arsenal in January 1999 and then three days later, Forssell made his first start for the club when he scored two goals against Oxford United in the FA Cup. His first league goal came three weeks later, when he scored against Nottingham Forest. However, when Chelsea signed Chris Sutton for £10 million, Forssell was loaned out twice to Crystal Palace of the then First Division, scoring 16 league goals in just over 50 appearances.

Forssell found it hard to find a place in the Chelsea first team with Gianfranco Zola, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Tore Andre Flo and Eiður Guðjohnsen, who were all ahead of him in the pecking order. After initially impressing new manager Claudio Ranieri, scoring in four consecutive games, he was sent out on loan again and had spells at Borussia Mönchengladbach of the German Bundesliga and twice to Birmingham City of the Premier League. Forssell scored seven Bundesliga goals for Mönchengladbach in the spring of 2003 and then 17 Premier League goals for Birmingham in the 2003–04 season (more league goals than any other Chelsea player), during which he was the division&#x27;s fifth highest goalscorer. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for March 2004, a month in which he scored twice in a 4–1 win against Leeds United, and won Birmingham&#x27;s Player of the Year award.

He returned to Birmingham on loan for the 2004–05 season, but suffered the second serious knee injury of his career. He returned to Chelsea to recuperate, and made occasional appearances for Chelsea that season, playing against Bayern Munich in the Champions League and in the last home match, against Charlton Athletic, as Chelsea celebrated winning their first top-flight title for 50 years.

===Birmingham City===
In the summer of 2005, Forssell joined Birmingham on a three-year deal for a fee of £3.5 million, after Chelsea decided that he did not figure in their long-term plans. He struggled in the 2005–06 season, not having found his best form after his injury, and could not save Birmingham from relegation. Forssell suffered another cruel injury blow to his other knee during training in October 2006. This left him on the sidelines until he returned to training in February 2007 after undergoing operations on both knees. He remained at Birmingham to have another go at resurrecting his career.

His 2007–08 pre-season performances were good, he scored five goals in five games. His manager, Steve Bruce, was enthusiastic about his return to form. He continued his good form into the start of the season, scoring the opening goal of the match against Chelsea and consolidating his good form with two assists in the next three matches. He scored his first hat-trick at club level on 1 March 2008, in the 4–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, a so-called &quot;perfect hat-trick&quot; – one goal scored with the left foot, one with the right, and one with the head. In his final season at Birmingham, he finished the season as their top scorer with nine goals as the club were relegated from the Premier League.

===Hannover 96===
In May 2008, following the club&#x27;s relegation from Premier League, Forssell signed a pre-contract agreement to join Hannover 96 on a free transfer when his Birmingham contract expired at the end of June. His contract with Hannover ran out at the end of the 2010–11 season.

On his pre-season debut for Hannover, he scored 10 goals including an eight-minute hat-trick in one friendly game against amateurs FC Boffzen. The game ended up as a 23–0 win.

===Leeds United===
After leaving Hannover when his contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season, Forssell had trials with clubs including West Ham United and Leeds United of the English Football League Championship (second tier). On 8 September he returned from international duty with Finland to sign a contract with Leeds until the end of the 2011–12 season. Forssell was handed the number 18 shirt and took his place on the bench two days later against his former club Crystal Palace. He came on as a second-half substitute to make his Leeds debut and assisted Ross McCormack for their winning goal in a 3–2 victory. He came on as a substitute against fierce rivals Manchester United in a 3–0 League Cup defeat.

After mainly being used as a substitute and failing to score a single goal for Leeds, Forssell was told by Neil Warnock that his one-year contract wouldn&#x27;t be renewed at the end of the 2011–12 season and that he would be released from the club at the expiry of his contract.

===Return to HJK===
On 29 October 2012, it was announced that Forssell would be returning to Finland after spending 14 years abroad, signing a two-year contract with his former club HJK. On 22 April 2013, Forssell opened the scoring by a header, in a 2–0 away win over rivals Honka. He finished the season with 14 league goals, the club&#x27;s top goalscorer as HJK won their fifth consecutive championship.

After a stint with German side VfL Bochum, Forssell rejoined HJK on 3 March 2016.

===HIFK and retirement===
On 10 April 2017, Forssell signed a contract for one year with HIFK. Forssell announced his retirement in May 2018.

==International career==
Forssell was a regular for the Finnish national team for most of the 2000s. He played his first match for Finland on 9 June 1999 against Moldova, and scored his first goal on 28 February 2001 against Luxembourg. He often partnered Jari Litmanen. Forssell also played for Finland in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.

Forssell scored twice against Germany in a 2002 World Cup qualifier; the match ended 2–2.

Forssell scored two hat-tricks for Finland. On 7 September 2005, in Tampere, he scored three goals against FYR Macedonia in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. On 17 November 2010, Forssell scored three of Finland&#x27;s eight goals against San Marino in the Euro 2012 qualifying.

==Coaching career==

<doc id="1145348" wikidata="Q1194636" url="?curid=1145348" title="Alive 1997">
<text>Alive 1997 is the first live album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 1 October 2001 by Virgin Records. It contains a 45-minute excerpt of a live performance recorded during Daftendirektour at Birmingham&#x27;s Que Club on 8 November 1997. 

The album was generally positively received by critics. &quot;Alive 1997&quot; peaked at number 25 on the French Albums Chart.

==Background==
The album was initially released online as part of the Daft Club service. Early pressings of the Daft Punk album &quot;Discovery&quot; contained a card that would allow access to the Daft Club website containing remixes and the live recording. The Daft Club service ended in 2003. The performance at Birmingham&#x27;s Que Club was considered by Daft Punk to be one of their favorite live sets at the time of its release.

&quot;Alive 1997&quot; prominently features elements of &quot;Daftendirekt&quot;, &quot;Da Funk&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; &amp; Scratchin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; from their &quot;Homework&quot; album. There are also prominent elements of Armand Van Helden&#x27;s &quot;Ten Minutes of Funk&quot; remix of &quot;Da Funk&quot;. The live performance also contains elements of what would later become the track &quot;Short Circuit&quot; featured in &quot;Discovery&quot;.

&quot;Alive 1997&quot; contains the 45-minute excerpt as a continuous track. The physical releases contain no tracklisting. The CD and vinyl packaging included a set of Daft Punk stickers. The layout for the album was done by Åbäke, and the photography by Serge Paulet. In 2022, the album was reissued for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Homework&quot;.
==Critical reception==
Reception to &quot;Alive 1997&quot; was generally positive upon release. John Bush of AllMusic noted how &quot;radically different&quot; the live versions of Daft Punk&#x27;s tracks are compared to the originals, and that the release accurately captured the energy of the stage show. Fiona Reid of &quot;Hot Press&quot; felt that the audible audience enhanced the record, making it reminiscent to sound effects heard in &quot;Homework&quot;. An &quot;NME&quot; review called &quot;Alive 1997&quot; &quot;an immaculately executed product&quot;, expressing that it was preferred over the &quot;sleek sophistication&quot; of &quot;Discovery&quot;. Sputnikmusic also felt that it was superior to the duo&#x27;s later live album &quot;Alive 2007&quot;, in particular highlighting the singular continuous flow of the 1997 performance. &quot;Q&quot; called &quot;Alive 1997&quot; &quot;45 minutes of breathless electronic excitement&quot; while &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that it &quot;has a shrill rawness that vividly captures a night of sweat-stained gymnastics&quot;.

<doc id="1145351" wikidata="Q1280105" url="?curid=1145351" title="Nuba peoples">
<text>The Nuba people are indigenous inhabitants of southern Sudan. The Nuba are made up of 50 various indigenous ethnic groups who inhabit the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan state in Sudan, encompassing multiple distinct people that speak different languages which belong to at least two unrelated language families. Estimates of the Nuba population vary widely; the Sudanese government estimated that they numbered 2.07 million in 2003.

The term Nuba should not be confused with the Nubians, an unrelated ethnic group speaking the Nubian languages living in northern Sudan and southern Egypt, although the Hill Nubians, who live in the Nuba Mountains, are also considered part of the Nubian people.

==Overview==
===Dwellings===

The Nuba people reside in the foothills of the Nuba Mountains. Villages consist of family compounds. A family compound consists of a rectangular compound enclosing two round mud huts thatched with sorghum stalks facing each other called a &quot;shal&quot;. The &quot;shal&quot; is fenced with wooden posts interwoven with straw. Two benches run down the each side of the &quot;shal&quot; with a fire in the middle where families will tell stories and oral traditions. Around the &quot;shal&quot; is the much larger yard, the &quot;tog&quot; placed in front. The fence of the &quot;tog&quot; is made of strong tree branches as high as the roof of the huts. Small livestock like goats and chickens and donkeys are kept in the tog. Each compound has tall conical granaries called &quot;durs&quot; which stand on one side of the &quot;tog&quot;. At the back of the compound is a small yard where maize and vegetables like pumpkin, beans and peanuts are grown.

===Languages===
The Nuba people speak various languages not closely related to each other. Most of the Nuba people speak one of the many languages in the geographic Kordofanian languages group of the Nuba Mountains. This language group is primarily in the major Niger–Congo language family. Several Nuba languages are in the Nilo-Saharan language family.

Over one hundred languages are spoken in the area and are considered Nuba languages, although many of the Nuba also speak Sudanese Arabic, the common language of Sudan.

===Culture===
The Nuba people are primarily farmers, as well as herders who keep cattle, chickens, and other domestic animals. They often maintain three different farms: a garden near their homes where vegetables needing constant attention, such as onions, peppers and beans, are grown; fields further up the hills where quick growing crops such as red millet can be cultivated without irrigation; and farms farther away, where white millet and other crops are planted.

A distinctive characteristic of the Nuba people is their passion for athletic competition, particularly traditional wrestling. The strongest young men of a community compete with athletes from other villages for the chance to promote their personal and their village&#x27;s pride and strength. In some villages, older men participate in club- or spear-fighting contests. The Nubas’ passion for physical excellence is also displayed through the young men&#x27;s vanity—they often spend hours painting their bodies with complex patterns and decorations. This vanity reflects the basic Nuba belief in the power and importance of strength and beauty.

====Religions====
The primary religion of many Nuba people is Islam, with some Christians, and traditional shamanistic beliefs also prevailing. Muslim Men wear a sarong and occasionally a skull cap. Older women and young women wear beads and wrap a sarong over their legs and sometimes a cloak tie on the shoulder. Both sexes practice scarification and circumcision for boys and female genital mutilation for girls. Some men shave their heads, older Muslim men wear skull caps and grow beards, women and girls braid their hair in strands and string it with beads.

The majority of the Nuba living in the east, west and northern parts of the mountains are Muslims, while those living to the south are either Christians or practice traditional animistic religions. In those areas of the Nuba mountains where Islam has not deeply penetrated, ritual specialists and priests hold as much control as the clan elders, for it is they who are responsible for rain control, keeping the peace, and rituals to ensure successful crops. Many are guardians of the shrines where items are kept to insure positive outcomes of the rituals (such as rain stones for the rain magic), and some also undergo what they recognize as spiritual possession.

====Politics====
In the 1986 elections, the National Umma Party lost several seats to the Nuba Mountains General Union and to the Sudan National Party, due to the reduced level of support from the Nuba Mountains region. There is reason to believe that attacks by the government-supported militia, the Popular Defense Force (PDF), on several Nuba villages were meant to be in retaliation for this drop in support, which was seen as signaling increased support of the SPLA. The PDF attacks were particularly violent, and have been cited as examples of crimes against humanity that took place during the Second Sudanese Civil War

During the military dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir, Nuba people in the capital Khartoum were repeatedly attacked and some even killed by pro-government students and agents of the National Intelligence and Security Service. As a result of discrimination by governments and parts of the Sudanese society, Nuba people have been largely excluded from the official national Sudanese identity, and hardly ever been represented in the government.

=== Nuba people in Khartoum ===
Following the Nuba Cultural Heritage Festival in 2011 in Omdurman, Nuba residents of Greater Khartoum have been celebrating Nuba culture in the capital. Part of these celebrations has been the selection of educated, young Nuba women as Beauty Queens of the Nuba Mountains. In 2014, Natalina Yacoub, at the time a student at Ahfad University for Women, was chosen as Nuba Beauty Queen and subsequently gave the first TEDx talk of a Nuba person. Being a member of the Christian minority in Sudan, she presented a Christmas gift on 24 December 2019 to then-Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who subsequently tweeted: &quot;This is the Sudan we dream of. One that respects diversity and enables all Sudanese citizens to practice their faith in a safe and dignified environment.&quot;

== Nuba Mountains ==
 In the Middle Ages, the Nuba Mountains were part of the kingdom of Alodia. The Nuba people reside in one of the most remote and inaccessible places in all of Sudan, the foothills of the Nuba Mountains in central Sudan. At one time the area was considered a place of refuge, bringing together people of many different tongues and backgrounds who were fleeing oppressive governments and slave traders.

The Nuba Mountains mark the southern border of the sands of the desert and the northern limit of good soils washed down by the Nile River. Many Nuba, however, have migrated to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to escape persecution and the effects of Sudan&#x27;s civil war. Most of the rest of the 1,000,000 Nuba people live in villages and towns of between 1,000 and 50,000 inhabitants in areas in and surrounding the Nuba mountains. Nuba villages are often built where valleys run from the hills out on to the surrounding plains, because water is easier to find at such points and wells can be used all year long. There is no political unity among the various Nuba groups who live on the hills. Often the villages do not have chiefs, but are instead organized into clans or extended family groups with village authority left in the hands of clan elders.

== War in the Nuba Mountains ==
===Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005)===
After some earlier incursions by the SPLA, the Second Sudanese Civil War started full scale in the Nuba Mountains when the Volcano Battalion of the SPLA under the command of the Nuba Yousif Kuwa Mekki and Abdel Aziz Adam al-Hillu entered the mountains and began to recruit Nuba volunteers and send them to SPLA training facilities in Ethiopia. The volunteers walked to Ethiopia and back and many of them perished on the way.

During the war, the SPLA generally held the mountains, while the Sudanese Army held the towns and fertile lands at the feet of the mountains, but was generally unable to dislodge the SPLA, even though the latter was usually undersupplied. The Governments of Sudan under Sadiq al-Mahdi and Omar al-Bashir also armed militias of Baggara Arabs to fight the Nuba and transferred many Nuba forcibly to camps.

In early 2002, the Government and the SPLA agreed on an internationally supervised ceasefire. International observers and advisors were quickly dispatched to Kadugli and several deployed into the mountains to co-located with SPLA command elements, with the base camp located in Kauda.

At that time, al-Hillu was the governor of the Nuba Mountains. During the course of the following months, relief supplies from the UN were airdropped to stem the starvation of many in the mountains.

The ceasefire in Nuba Mountains was the foundation for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in January 2005. This fragile peace remains in force, but infighting in the south, plus the Government of Sudan involvement in Darfur have resulted in issues which may break the peace agreement.

===Secession of South Sudan (2011)===
Southern Sudan voted to secede from Sudan in the 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum. This provision was agreed to in the CPA. This resulted in the formation of a new country, South Sudan, from the southern portion of Sudan. However, conflict between northern and southern forces, and against the Nuba peoples was renewed again in the region in 2011 in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

==Media==
* Local filmmaker Roopa Gogineni documented &quot;Bisha TV&quot;, a satirical muppet show popular throughout the Nuba lands, which serves as an &quot;example of how people use comedy to deal with authoritarian rule.&quot; The show mocks Sudan&#x27;s President Omar al-Bashir, depicting him as the killer of children and bomber of hospitals. A short documentary by Gogineni includes an apparent bombing of Kauda by an Antonov An-12 aircraft, as well as a public screening of &quot;Bisha TV&quot; in front of dozens of local residents.
* &quot;Eyes and Ears Of God – Video surveillance of Sudan&quot; (2012) film by peace activist Tomo Križnar on YouTube. The documentary film shows ethnic Nuba civilians defending themselves with the help of over 400 cameras distributed by Križnar and Klemen Mihelič, the founder of humanitarian organisation H.O.P.E., to volunteers across the war zones in the Nuba Mountains, the Blue Nile, and Darfur, documenting the (North) Sudanese military&#x27;s war crimes against local populations.
* Leni Riefenstahl, known for her 1930s documentary films &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; and &quot;Olympia&quot; of Nazi Germany, published two collections of her photographs of Nuba peoples, entitled &quot;The Last of the Nuba&quot; (1973) and &quot;The People of Kau&quot; (1976).

<text>The Rolls-Royce Meteor later renamed the Rover Meteor is a British tank engine that was developed during the Second World War. It was used in British tanks up to 1964. It was a result of co-operation between Leyland Motors and Rolls-Royce who between them in 1941 had suggested that a specialised de-rated version of the Merlin aero-engine would be highly suitable for use in armoured fighting vehicles.

The Meteor was developed from the Merlin by W. A. Robotham and his chassis design and development division at Clan Foundry, Belper, as they were not involved in aero-engine work and his engineers were under-used. With the aid of engineers from Leyland, who were engaged in tank work, he considered RR&#x27;s two V12s; the Kestrel, while having more power than the existing &quot;Liberty&quot; or Meadows engines, did not provide the desirable 20 bhp per ton (producing only 475 bhp on &quot;pool&quot; petrol) required, so the 1,030 bhp (770 kW) Merlin III was chosen. Also, the Merlin was being produced in two factories, and some components not suitable for an aero engine could be used in a &quot;derated&quot; Meteor engine (unlike an aero engine, a tank engine did not require continuous maximum power, even when driven hard). Robotham was at pains to point out that Rolls-Royce could not manufacture the engines, so would not benefit commercially. 

On 27 April 1941, the Directorate of Tank Design (DTD) supported production of the Meteor, eventually placing orders direct with Rolls-Royce to maintain development in connection with the Cromwell tank. A new tank specification, A27M, was produced for design of the Meteor-powered tank. The Meteor engine went on to become one of the most successful British tank engines.

In 1942, after the British Tank Mission visit to America in April, there was some pressure from British car and commercial vehicle manufacturers to adopt the new Ford V8 tank engine (to be used in the M4 Sherman tank) for use in British tanks, rather than the Meteor then under development, because an adapted aero engine &quot;would not be suitable as a rugged tank engine&quot;. But the Ford V8 had &quot;teething problems&quot;, which were not overcome until after the Normandy landings in 1944.

==Design and development==

===Engine design===

Development started with the use of recovered Merlin engine parts from crashed aircraft. While unsuitable for re-use in aircraft, the Rolls-Royce chassis division had begun collecting and refurbishing them in the hope of finding a use. Robotham was approached by Henry Spurrier, of Leyland Mechanization and Aero, to ask about help with tank powerplants. Based on Spurrier&#x27;s requirement, the first prototype Meteor engine (and subsequent production of Mark 1 engines) was assembled on the basis of recovered Merlin parts.

The major change for tank use was to reverse the direction of engine rotation. Automotive gearboxes ran the opposite way to an aircraft propeller and changing direction required modification of the camshaft lobes (most Merlins were &quot;right-hand tractor&quot;, i.e. the propeller rotated clockwise when viewed from the rear). For the Meteor, the Merlin supercharger, reduction gear and other equipment were removed from its crankshaft, greatly simplifying its construction. Many aircraft-specific parts were deleted, such as the propeller reduction gear and the aircraft-style starter. That meant the dimensions of the engine became similar to the Nuffield &quot;Liberty&quot; engine, and it would fit into the space for the Liberty Mark VI version in the Crusader tank. It retained the Merlin dual ignition system — each cylinder had two spark plugs, driven from separate magnetos.

On 6 April 1941, the first Merlin prepared for tank use was despatched to Aldershot in a modified Crusader tank, which was tested on the Army standard speed course behind Farnborough. A &quot;maximum revolution recorder&quot; recorded &quot;something in excess of &quot;. The officers with stopwatches at each end of the run were meant to signal each other by dropping handkerchiefs, but were so nonplussed that neither got a timing. Some spectators by the course took fright, running away and leaping over a hedge. The corporal driving kept his foot down, and failed to take a corner on the run-off section at the end, decapitating a telegraph pole and spreading coils of wire in all directions. So the concept was proved, surpassing all expectations.

The engine was commissioned for use in the new Cromwell tank and changes were made to the Cromwell development programme to accommodate it. To enable fitting it in-line with a Merrit-Brown gear (and steering) box, the engine was lowered. A new flat sump was created, the oil pumps changed and the crankshaft lined up with the new gearbox. The new engine had cast pistons, rather than forged ones, and was de-rated to around 600 bhp (447 kW), running on lower-octane pool petrol instead of high-octane avgas (aviation fuel). British Thomson-Houston (BTH) magnetos were changed for Simms units.

===Expansion into tank design===

The engine, and the Rolls-Royce team&#x27;s fresh look at tank development, had a major impact on British tank design. As development of the engine progressed, the Rolls-Royce team became more and more involved in development of the tank. Despite his lack of experience in tank design or warfare, Robotham was made Chief Engineer of Tank Design in the Ministry of Supply and joined the Tank Board. He was involved in the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank. The Rolls-Royce chassis division, which had commenced the Meteor design, evolved into its Tank Division at Belper and was involved with the overall design of four versions of the Cromwell tank, using a standard set of components.

==Production==

Early prototypes were produced by Rolls-Royce. In 1941, Leyland, which had an order for 1,200 Meteor engines, was still advocating its own diesel tank engine for the Cromwell tank. It would deliver only , but Leyland was concerned with the problem of sufficient cooling for the Meteor within the confines of the tank engine bay. When Leyland withdrew its support, Robotham took the problem to Ernest Hives. Hives took the problem to the Ministry of Supply, telling Lord Beaverbrook that he already had his hands full making Merlin aero engines, and Rolls-Royce would want £1 million to its credit and &#x27;no interference&#x27; to make tank engines, The Beaver telegrammed back:

An order for 1,000 engines followed with, and a new tank design specification was created: A27M, splitting design of the Meteor powered Cromwell away from Leyland to Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&amp;W). They resolved the cooling problems, ultimately delivering before Leyland&#x27;s version, although production leadership later switched back to Leyland when BRC&amp;W could not keep up with demand.

The Meteor was initially produced by Rolls-Royce but manufacturing capacity was severely limited due to the demand for Merlin engines. Early units were still manufactured using recovered Merlin parts and many early Meteors still showed crash damage. When engine manufacturing needed to increase output, brand new engines had to be made. Because weight saving was not so important for a tank engine, some of the Merlin&#x27;s more expensive light-alloy components were replaced with cheaper, steel versions. It was also envisaged that the Meteor would use some components rejected on quality grounds for the Merlin, but suitable for a derated Meteor engine. Many of these rejected parts while not meeting strict standards for airworthiness, were perfectly adequate for use in ground vehicles where the crew or operators were not subject to the inherent hazards involved in flight.

To increase production, Meadows produced some Meteors but the small factory of 2,000 men was producing 40 types of engine. To make enough Meteors for the Cromwell build programme, Rolls-Royce agreed to move Meteor production to the Rover Company at Tyseley and Morris at Coventry.

Rolls-Royce was also aiding the development of production jet engines at Rover, but progress there was slow and there were disputes between Power Jets designers of the engine. Rover became disillusioned. Backed by the MAP who were unable to force Power Jets to become part of Rover, Hives struck a deal in December 1942 with Spencer Wilks of Rover to trade W.2B/23 production and the Rover jet design team at Barnoldswick for the Rolls-Royce tank engine factory in Nottingham and production of the Meteor, to become officially effective on 1 April 1943. In 1943, an acute shortage of blocks was met by dismantling surplus older marks of Merlin.

Rover took over the Meteor in January 1944 and in 1946 the British Government made Rover responsible for research and development of large military engines. In this role, Rover continued the development and production of the Meteor Mk IVb and various derivatives, including the Meteorite V8 and the M120 V12. Rover ceased this activity in 1964, having produced approximately 9,000 engines. The Land Rover success required more manufacturing capacity, so Rolls-Royce again became responsible for the manufacture of spare parts. Future engines for British tanks were manufactured by the engine division Rolls-Royce Diesels of Shrewsbury, which in 1969 had a seven-figure unfulfilled order for Meteor spares&quot;.&quot; It was acquired by Perkins in the 1980s. Perkins was taken over by Caterpillar Inc in 1997.

==Performance==

Previously British tanks had been regarded as underpowered and unreliable and the Meteor is considered to be the engine that, for the first time, gave British tanks ample, reliable power. Replacing the earlier Liberty L-12 licence-built by Nuffield and used in the Crusader, the Meteor engine in the Cromwell tank provided almost twice the performance in virtually the same displacement. Reliability was significantly improved against previous tank engines. With a Rolls-Royce Merlin origin, the Meteor was very lightly stressed and reliable. W. A. Robotham was surprised and pleased when in 1963 Duncan Sandys said &quot;I regard the adoption of the Meteor tank engine as the absolute turning-point in the history of British tank development&quot;, at the opening of the Rolls-Royce aero engine factory at East Kilbride. Sandys had been wartime Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply and Robotham who resigned from the Ministry in 1943 wrote that Sandys was knowledgeable on army matters. 

With the introduction of the Meteor engine in the Cromwell, originally intended for the Liberty, the boost to gave the vehicle exceptional mobility and speed. This increase in power made it possible to integrate greater armour on following tanks. Designers and military planners started to consider the possibility of a Universal tank, able to undertake both high-armour (Infantry tank) and high-mobility (Cruiser tank) roles. Ultimately, this resulted in the Centurion tank and evolved into the main battle tank concept.

==Applications==

The Meteor was used in the following vehicles:
* Cromwell
* Challenger
* Avenger, a reworked design of Challenger for use as self-propelled artillery.
* Comet
* Centurion
* Charioteer
* Tortoise experimental assault tank.
* Caernarvon, used to train crews for Conqueror
* Conqueror post war heavy tank
* Helmover torpedo, also known as the Helmore Projector, an experimental, 30 ft long remote-controlled heavy torpedo

<doc id="1145353" wikidata="Q1238121" url="?curid=1145353" title="Dominion theology">
<text>Dominion theology, also known as dominionism, is a group of far-right Christian political ideologies that seek to institute a nation governed by Christians and based on their understandings of biblical law. Extents of rule and ways of acquiring governing authority are varied. For example, dominion theology can include theonomy but does not necessarily involve advocacy of adherence to the Mosaic Law as the basis of government. The label is primarily applied to groups of Christians in the United States.

Prominent adherents of those ideologies include Calvinist Christian reconstructionism, Charismatic and Pentecostal Kingdom Now theology, and the New Apostolic Reformation. Most of the contemporary movements that are labeled dominion theology arose in the 1970s from religious movements asserting aspects of Christian nationalism. Roman Catholic integralism is also sometimes considered to fall under the dominionist umbrella, but the Catholic integralist movement is much older and theologically markedly different from Protestant dominionism since it is tied to the doctrine that the Catholic Church is the only true church.

== Etymology ==
Dominion theology is a reference to the King James Bible&#x27;s rendering of Genesis 1:28 in which God grants humanity &quot;dominion&quot; over the Earth.

And God blessed them, and God said unto them, &quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot;

In the late 1980s, several prominent Evangelical authors used the phrase &quot;dominion theology&quot; and other terms such as &quot;dominionism&quot; to label a loose grouping of theological movements that made direct appeals to the passage in Genesis. Christians typically interpret the passage as meaning that God gave mankind responsibility over the Earth, but one of the most distinctive aspects of dominion theology is that it is interpreted as a mandate for Christian stewardship in civil affairs, no less than in other human matters.

== Types ==
=== Protestant Christian reconstructionism ===
An example of dominionism in Reformed theology is Christian reconstructionism, which originated in the teachings of R. J. Rushdoony in the 1960s and the 1970s. His theology focuses on theonomy, the rule of the Law of God, and his belief that all of society should be ordered according to the laws that governed the Israelites in the Old Testament. His ideas on biblical law in civil government are laid out most comprehensively in &quot;The Institutes of Biblical Law&quot;, but he wrote many other books dealing with the subject. Rushdoony&#x27;s proposed system is strongly Calvinistic by emphasizing the sovereignty of God over human freedom and action, and denying the operation of charismatic gifts in the present day (cessationism). Both of those aspects are in direct opposition to Kingdom Now theology (see below).

Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among most Christians. Dave Hunt, Albert James Dager, Hal Lindsey, and Thomas Ice specifically criticize Christian reconstructionism from a Christian viewpoint and disagree on theological grounds with its theocratic elements as well as its Calvinism and postmillennialism. J. Ligon Duncan, Sherman Isbell, Vern Poythress, Robert Godfrey, and Sinclair Ferguson analyze reconstructionism as conservative Calvinists, primarily giving a theological critique of its theocratic elements. Michael J. McVicar has noted that many leading Christian reconstructionists are also leading writers in paleolibertarian circles.

Some social scientists have used the word &quot;dominionism&quot; to refer to adherence to Christian reconstructionism.

=== Catholic integralism ===
Catholic integralism has been characterized as a form of dominionist theology, but in reality, it is much older and theologically distinct from the dominionism that is espoused by Protestants. Antonio Spadaro and Marcelo Figueroa have said that Catholic integralists have entered into a nontraditional ecumenical alliance with Protestant reconstructionists who share &quot;the same desire for religious influence in the political sphere.&quot; Likewise, in the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, Joshua J. McElwee wrote that Catholic integralists, along with their Protestant counterparts, wish to establish a &quot;theocratic type of state.&quot; But ultimately, the goals of Protestant dominionists and Catholic integralists are divergent, as Catholic integralists adhere to the doctrine that the Catholic Church is the &quot;only true church&quot; and that every form of Protestantism is &quot;heretical.&quot; That has not prevented cooperation between them, however, when it has been mutually beneficial.

Catholic integralism has a much longer history than the Protestant dominionism that arose in the U.S. in the 1970s and in fact has its root in traditional Catholic doctrine on church-state relations that developed when the governments of Europe were nearly all Catholic confessional states and had Catholicism as their official religion. Such a political conception was referred to as &quot;Christendom&quot; with the summit of political authority held by the Holy Roman Emperor and the summit of spiritual authority held by the Supreme Pontiff (Pope). After the movement toward liberal secularism and disestablishmentarianism, several modern states eventually reacted with a revived integralism, often in a fascistic or proto-fascistic form, such as in Spain under the leadership of Francisco Franco, Portugal under Antonio Salazar, and Austria under Engelbert Dollfuß and his Fatherland Front. Today, only a handful of states remain with Catholicism as the official established religion of state, but there are still movements in other nations and among some in the Catholic hierarchy who support a revival of integralism in states that have become secular.
In recent years, a &quot;revived Catholic integralism&quot; has been noted among the younger generation of Catholics writing for websites such as &quot;The Josias&quot;. Integralism could be said to merely be the modern continuation of the traditional Catholic conception of church–state relations elucidated by Pope Gelasius I and expounded upon throughout the centuries until the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, which condemned the idea that the separation of church and state is a moral good. For example, some Catholics have praised the actions of Pius IX in the 1858 Mortara case in which he ordered the abduction of a six-year-old Jewish boy who had been baptized without his parents&#x27; consent. A systematic account of Catholic integralism as a coherent political philosophy has been written by the Catholic theologians Thomas Crean and Alan Fimister: &quot;Integralism: a manual of political philosophy&quot;.

Today, the Catholic Church&#x27;s political treaties with various countries, known as concordats, are criticized by some liberal and democratic human rights groups for advancing Catholic integralism. More than 200 concordats are in force. Some of them explicitly guarantee that Catholicism is recognized as the official religion of state in several countries and others grant historical recognition of the Catholic faith and grant certain rights and privileges to the Church.

=== Pentecostal Kingdom Now theology ===
Kingdom Now theology is a branch of dominion theology that has a following within Pentecostalism and attracted attention in the late 1980s.

Kingdom Now theology states that although Satan has been in control of the world since the Fall of Man, God is looking for people who will help him take back dominion. Those who yield themselves to the authority of God&#x27;s apostles and prophets will take control of the kingdoms of this world, being defined as all social institutions, the &quot;kingdom&quot; of education, the &quot;kingdom&quot; of science, the &quot;kingdom&quot; of the arts, etc. C. Peter Wagner, the founder of the New Apostolic Reformation, writes: &quot;The practical theology that best builds a foundation under social transformation is dominion theology, sometimes called &#x27;Kingdom Now&#x27;. Its history can be traced back through R. J. Rushdoony and Abraham Kuyper to John Calvin.&quot;

Kingdom Now theology is influenced by the Latter Rain movement, and critics have connected it to the New Apostolic Reformation, &quot;Spiritual Warfare Christianity,&quot; and Fivefold ministry thinking.

Seven Mountains Dominionism, also known as the Seven Mountains Mandate or 7MM, has become a more prevalent manifestation of Kingdom Now theology since the early 2010s. Bill Bright, Loren Cunningham, and Francis Schaeffer are often credited as having been given the same divine vision that revealed the Seven Mountain Mandate in 1975. The mandate proposes that there are seven &quot;mountains&quot; that Christians must control to establish a global Christian theocracy and prepare the world for Jesus&#x27; return: government, education, media, arts and entertainment, religion, family, and business. The mandate is based on two Biblical passages: Isaiah 2:2-3, which says, &quot;In the last days the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains,&quot; and Revelation 17:1–18, which describes &quot;a scarlet beast... [with] had seven heads and ten horns.&quot; Prominent Christian leaders who support Seven Mountains Dominionism include David Barton, James Dobson, John Hagee, Bill Johnson, Lance Wallnau, and Paula White. Notable politicians who have embraced it include Michele Bachmann, Sam Brownback, Ted Cruz, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, Charlie Kirk, Sarah Palin, and Rick Perry.

Kingdom Now theology should not be confused with Kingdom theology, which is related to inaugurated eschatology.

== Christian right ==

In the late 1980s, the sociologist Sara Diamond started to write about the intersection of dominion theology with the political activism of the Christian right. Diamond argued that &quot;the primary importance of the [Christian reconstructionist] ideology is its role as a catalyst for what is loosely called &#x27;dominion theology.&#x27;&quot; According to Diamond, &quot;Largely through the impact of Rushdoony&#x27;s and North&#x27;s writings, the concept that Christians are Biblically mandated to &#x27;occupy&#x27; all secular institutions has become the &quot;central unifying ideology&quot; for the Christian Right&quot; in the United States.

While acknowledging the small number of actual adherents, authors such as Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have argued that postmillennial Christian reconstructionism played a major role in pushing the primarily premillennial Christian right to adopt a more aggressive dominionist stance.

Misztal and Shupe concur with Sara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson by arguing, &quot;Reconstructionists have many more sympathizers who fall somewhere within the dominionist framework, but who are not card-carrying members.&quot; According to Diamond, &quot;Reconstructionism is the most intellectually grounded, though esoteric, brand of dominion theology.&quot;

The journalist Frederick Clarkson defined &quot;dominionism&quot; as a movement that includes dominion theology and reconstructionism as subsets but is much broader in scope and extends to much of the Christian right in the United States.

In his 1992 study of dominion theology and its influence on the Christian right, Bruce Barron wrote:
In the context of American evangelical efforts to penetrate and transform public life, the distinguishing mark of a dominionist is a commitment to defining and carrying out an approach to building society that is &quot;self-consciously defined as exclusively Christian,&quot; and dependent specifically on the work of Christians, rather than based on a broader consensus.

In 1995, Diamond called the influence of dominion theology &quot;prevalent on the Christian Right.&quot;

The journalist Chip Berlet added in 1998 that although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists assert a Christian duty to take &quot;control of a sinful secular society.&quot;

In 2005, Clarkson enumerated the following characteristics shared by all forms of dominionism:
#Dominionists celebrate Christian nationalism, in that they believe that the United States once was, and should once again be, a Christian nation. In this way, they deny the Enlightenment roots of American democracy.
#Dominionists promote religious supremacy, insofar as they generally do not respect the equality of other religions, or even other versions of Christianity.
#Dominionists endorse theocratic visions, insofar as they believe that the Ten Commandments, or &quot;biblical law,&quot; should be the foundation of American law, and that the U.S. Constitution should be seen as a vehicle for implementing Biblical principles.
The essayist Katherine Yurica began using the term &quot;dominionism&quot; in her articles in 2004, beginning with &quot;The Despoiling of America&quot; (February 11, 2004). Authors who also use the term &quot;dominionism&quot; in the broader sense include the journalist Chris Hedges, Marion Maddox, James Rudin, Michelle Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Sam Harris, Ryan Lizza, Frank Schaeffer, and the group TheocracyWatch. Some authors have applied the term to a broader spectrum of people than have Diamond, Clarkson, and Berlet.

Sarah Posner in &quot;Salon&quot; argues that there are various &quot;iterations of dominionism that call on Christians to enter... government, law, media and so forth... so that they are controlled by Christians.&quot; According to Posner, &quot;Christian right figures promoted dominionism... and the GOP courted... religious leaders for the votes of their followers.&quot; She added: &quot;If people really understood dominionism, they’d worry about it between election cycles.&quot;

Michelle Goldberg notes that George Grant wrote in his 1987 book &quot;The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action&quot;:

=== Spectrum of dominionism ===
Writers including Chip Berlet and Frederick Clarkson distinguish between what they term &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; dominionism. Such commentators define &quot;soft&quot; dominionism as the belief that &quot;America is a Christian nation&quot; and opposition to separation of church and state, but &quot;hard&quot; dominionism refers to dominion theology and Christian reconstructionism.

Michelle Goldberg uses the terms &quot;Christian nationalism&quot; and &quot;dominionism&quot; for the former view. According to Goldberg:

In many ways, Dominionism is more a political phenomenon than a theological one. It cuts across Christian denominations, from stern, austere sects to the signs-and-wonders culture of modern megachurches. Think of it like political Islamism, which shapes the activism of a number of antagonistic fundamentalist movements, from Sunni Wahabis in the Arab world to Shiite fundamentalists in Iran.

Berlet and Clarkson have agreed, &quot;Soft Dominionists are Christian nationalists.&quot; Unlike &quot;dominionism&quot;, the phrase &quot;Christian nation&quot; occurs commonly in the writings of leaders of the Christian right. Proponents of the idea (such as David Barton and D. James Kennedy) argue that the Founding Fathers of the United States were overwhelmingly Christian, that founding documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are based on Christian principles, and that a Christian character is fundamental to American culture. They cite, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s comment in 1892 that &quot;this [the United States] is a Christian nation&quot; after they cite numerous historical and legal arguments in support of that statement.

Kennedy characterized his perspective on Christian political involvement as more akin to participatory democracy than to dominionism. In an interview with NPR&#x27;s Terry Gross, Kennedy was asked whether he wanted all public office holders to be Christians. Kennedy answered, &quot;We have people who are secular and humanist and unbelievers who are constantly supporting in every way possible other people who share those views. And I don&#x27;t object to that. That&#x27;s their privilege. And I think that Christians should be allowed the same privilege to vote for people whom they believe share their views about life and government. And that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m talking about.&quot;

== Criticism of usage of term ==
Those labelled dominionists rarely use the terms &quot;dominionist&quot; and &quot;dominionism&quot; for self-description, and some people have attacked the use of such words. The journalist and conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz, writing for the &quot;National Review&quot;, labeled it &quot;conspiratorial nonsense,&quot; &quot;political paranoia,&quot; and &quot;guilt by association&quot;, and decried Hedges&#x27; &quot;vague characterizations&quot; that allow him to &quot;paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless &#x27;Dominionist&#x27; Christian mass&quot;. Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian reconstructionism:

The notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it&#x27;s downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside &#x27;the old polite rules of democracy.&#x27; So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians—by any means necessary.

Joe Carter of &quot;First Things&quot; writes:

[T]here is no &quot;school of thought&quot; known as &quot;dominionism.&quot; The term was coined in the 1980s by Diamond and is never used outside liberal blogs and websites. No reputable scholars use the term for it is a meaningless neologism that Diamond concocted for her dissertation.

Diamond denies that she coined the broader sense of the term &quot;dominionism&quot;, which appears in her dissertation and in &quot;Roads to Dominion&quot; solely to describe dominion theology. Nevertheless, Diamond originated the idea that dominion theology is the &quot;central unifying ideology for the Christian Right.&quot;

Jeremy Pierce of &quot;First Things&quot; coined the word &quot;dominionismist&quot; to describe those who promote the idea that there is a dominionist conspiracy and wrote:

It strikes me as irresponsible to lump [Rushdoony] together with Francis Schaeffer and those influenced by him, especially given Schaeffer&#x27;s many recorded instances of resisting exactly the kinds of views Rushdoony developed. Indeed, it strikes me as an error of the magnitude of some of Rushdoony&#x27;s own historical nonsense to consider there to be such a view called Dominionism that Rushdoony, Schaeffer, James Dobson, and all the other people in the list somehow share and that it seeks to get Christians and only Christians into all the influential positions in secular society.

Lisa Miller of &quot;Newsweek&quot; writes that dominionism&#x27; is the paranoid &quot;&quot;&quot; and that &quot;certain journalists use &#x27;dominionist&#x27; the way some folks on Fox News use the word &quot;sharia&quot;. Its strangeness scares people. Without history or context, the word creates a siege mentality in which &#x27;we&#x27; need to guard against &#x27;them&#x27;.&quot; Ross Douthat of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;many of the people that writers like Diamond and others describe as &#x27;dominionists&#x27; would disavow the label, many definitions of dominionism conflate several very different Christian political theologies, and there&#x27;s a lively debate about whether the term is even useful at all.&quot;

Other criticism has focused on the proper use of the term. Berlet wrote that &quot;just because some critics of the Christian Right have stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point does not mean we should abandon the term,&quot; and argued that rather than label conservatives as extremists, it would be better to &quot;talk to these people&quot; and &quot;engage them.&quot; Diamond wrote, &quot;Liberals&#x27; writing about the Christian Right&#x27;s take-over plans has generally taken the form of conspiracy theory&quot; and argued that instead, one should &quot;analyze the subtle ways&quot; that ideas like Dominionism &quot;take hold within movements and why.&quot; The authors Robert Gagnon and Edith Humphrey argued strongly against the use of the term in reference to the US presidential candidate Ted Cruz in a 2016 op-ed for &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.

<text>Thymolphthalein is a phthalein dye used as an acid–base (pH) indicator. Its transition range is around pH 9.3–10.5. Below this pH, it is colorless; above, it is blue. The molar extinction coefficient for the blue thymolphthalein dianion is 38,000 M−1 cm−1 at 595 nm.

Thymolphthalein is also known to have use as a laxative and for disappearing ink.

==Preparation==
Thymolphthalein can be synthesized from thymol and phthalic anhydride.

<doc id="1145357" wikidata="Q7549595" url="?curid=1145357" title="So What (Joe Walsh album)">
<text>So What is the third studio album by the American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. It was released in late 1974 on ABC-Dunhill Records.

It contains hard rock songs such as &quot;Welcome To The Club&quot; and a remake of the Barnstorm track, &quot;Turn To Stone&quot;. It also contains more introspective material such as &quot;Help Me Through the Night&quot; and &quot;Song For Emma&quot;.

On a few tracks, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and Randy Meisner of the Eagles contributed backing vocals. Over a year and a half later, Walsh would be drafted into the Eagles to replace founding member Bernie Leadon, playing on their best-selling studio album &quot;Hotel California&quot;.

==Production and recording==
Two months before the release of the album, Walsh was asked about the album, and he said &quot;I know this album&#x27;s going to be an important one for me, but it&#x27;s not easy to just crank them out anymore, I&#x27;ve got, what, six or seven albums out. I don&#x27;t want the next album to sound like a bunch of outtakes from Smoker. I want it to be the difference between &quot;Revolver&quot; and Sgt. Pepper. I&#x27;ve held back [the album&#x27;s release] until that development was there, even though the record company&#x27;s been screaming for it. I want it to be a big, big step… in thoughts, vocals, playing and maturity.&quot;

Don Henley wrote the lyrics for &quot;Falling Down&quot; with Henley providing backing vocals on &quot;Falling Down&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot;. The album features three of the four members of Eagles; Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner providing backing vocals for &quot;Turn to Stone&quot; and &quot;Help Me Through The Night&quot;. This would be the first time that the band members would appear on an album with the future Eagle.

&quot;Song for Emma&quot; was written as a memorial for Walsh&#x27;s almost-three-year-old daughter who had been killed in a car crash on April 1, 1974, four weeks shy of her third birthday. The accident was caused by a driver who failed to stop at a stop sign, hitting the Porsche driven by his then-wife Stefany with Emma in the car. Later, Stevie Nicks wrote &quot;Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?&quot; for Walsh after visiting Emma&#x27;s grave with him.

Producer Bill Szymczyk had the following written on the run out groove of the vinyl &quot;THAT&#x27;S NO BANANY, THATS MY NOZE&quot; on the first pressings of the vinyl.

==Critical reception==

Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Ben Davies wrote of the album &quot;A number of classic Walsh tracks are featured, including a more polished version of &quot;Turn to Stone,&quot; originally featured on his debut album, Barnstorm, in a somewhat more riotous style... Most of the nine tracks feature solos of unquestionable quality in his usual rock style. The classic rock genre that the man so well defined with his earlier albums is present here throughout, and it is pulled off with the usual unparalleled Joe Walsh ability.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; said &quot;Time Out&quot; has &quot;the perfect combination of [Walsh&#x27;s] tasty, extended guitar licks and his vital vocal/lyric capabilities.&quot;

==Release history==

The album was re-issued by MCA Records in 1979 as &quot;Joe Walsh&quot; and minus &quot;All Night Laundry Mat Blues&quot;. It appeared in 2011 in Japan in a limited edition miniature replica sleeve in the SHM-CD format. Audio Fidelity released the album on the Super Audio CD format in 2015.

<text>The article is about China&#x27;s first-level administrative divisions by their gross domestic product per capita in main years. All figures are given in the national currency, renminbi (CNY), and in USD at nominal values, according to China official exchange rates as well as according to purchasing power parity (PPP). The average CNY exchange rate used here is from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and CNY PPP exchange rates are estimated according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Since the implementation of reform and opening up in mainland China in 1978, its economy has developed rapidly. In 1995, the GDP per capita of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai reached more than 1,000 US dollars; by 2000, there were 10 provinces with GDP per capita exceeding 1,000 US dollars, of which Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai exceeded 2,000 US dollars. Per capita GDP exceeded US$10,000 for the first time in Beijing (US$10,402) and Shanghai (US$10,593) in 2009. Mainland China&#x27;s per capita GDP (US$10,158) exceeded US$10,000 for the first time in the year of 2019, and 11 provinces including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia and Shandong had per capita GDP exceeding US$10,000, among which the per capita GDP in Beijing and Shanghai overtook US$20,000 in the year. By 2022, only Gansu Province had per capita GDP of US$6,638, while the others all were above US$7,500.

Apart from the national capital of Beijing and the financial capital of Shanghai, coastal provinces lead the per capita GDP rankings within China, as these coastal provinces are most heavily exposed to export-oriented industrialization. The seaports present within the coastal provinces enable the provinces&#x27; greater exposure to international trade and allow both local and foreign companies, which are recipients of foreign direct investment into China, to export goods and reach global markets faster.

For comparison purposes, this article also displays the GDPs of the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau, which maintain separate economic systems and currencies. These figures are shown in USD based on PPP, as estimated by the International Monetary Fund.

<doc id="1145366" wikidata="Q4994410" url="?curid=1145366" title="Sun-Maid">
<text>Sun-Maid Growers of California is an American farmer-owned cooperative of raisin growers headquartered in Fresno, California. Sun-Maid is one of the largest raisin and dried fruit processors in the world. As a cooperative, Sun-Maid is made up of approximately 850 family farmers who grow raisin grapes within a radius of the processing plant. Sun-Maid also sources dried fruit beyond this geographical area.

Sun-Maid raisins are packaged in a red box featuring the “Sun-Maid Girl” wearing a red sunbonnet and holding a tray of fresh grapes. Sun-Maid raisins are grown in the Central Valley of California, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a region known for its climate perfect for growing grapes to make raisins. The grapes are picked at harvest time, usually late August to early September, and dried in the sun, either by hand-picking them and laying them on paper trays, or allowing them to dry on the vine (DOV) for mechanical harvesting. Sun-Maid ships to customers throughout the United States and more than 60 countries around the world.

Sun-Maid produces more than of natural raisins annually. Nearly half of all Sun-Maid raisins are packed for consumer sales, whether in a box, a bag, or a canister in varying sizes. The other half are sold as an ingredient to bakeries and cereal companies as raisin paste and raisin concentrate. The Thompson Seedless grape is the most popular variety used to make raisins. 

Besides raisins, Sun-Maid sells a full line of dried fruit, such as figs, dates, cranberries, apples, prunes, apricots, and tropical fruits. Sun-Maid also sells yogurt-covered raisins.

The company maintains extensive brand licensing and food service operations. The Promotion in Motion Companies, Inc. under license from Sun-Maid, produces Sun-Maid raisins covered in milk chocolate.

==History==
In 1873, Francis T. Eisen planted an experimental vineyard of Muscat grapes on along Fancher Creek, just east of Fresno. By 1878, packaged raisins were being shipped out of the state, and by 1903, California was producing 120 million pounds of raisins a year.

Packing houses quickly became a vital link between the grower and the consumer, and dozens sprouted up across the San Joaquin Valley. Employing hundreds of immigrant people, these facilities received the sun-dried raisins from growers, which they stored, processed, packaged, and shipped throughout the United States and to countries around the world. When the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, farmers and immigrants from the East settled the area for the first time, and growers were able to quickly transport products from the West to new markets. In 1872, Leland Stanford brought the Central Pacific Railroad to the San Joaquin Valley, choosing a location in present-day downtown Fresno as the rail stop, Fresno Station. Depots in surrounding communities soon followed. As the railroads expanded, so too did the area surrounding Fresno Station, attracting farmers to grow agricultural products to satisfy the increasing demand from faraway markets. Many of the families suffered due to harmful chemicals that they were faced with while working on the farms.

Once raisins were established as a marketable crop which grew and dried well under the Californian sun, raisin grape-growing areas expanded rapidly in the late 19th century. The earliest successful efforts to form a cooperative business by raisin growers began in 1898. With community support, the California Associated Raisin Company was established in 1912. In 1915, the brand name Sun-Maid, coined by advertising executive E.A. Berg, was launched; and in 1918 the company opened a new facility near downtown Fresno, California.

By the early 1920s, the California Associated Raisin Company’s membership comprised 85 percent of the state’s raisin growers. The organization changed its name to Sun-Maid Growers of California in 1922 to identify more closely with its nationally recognized brand.

In 1964, further modernization and growth led to the construction of, and move to, a new facility in neighboring Kingsburg. The facility sits on more than , and is located south of Fresno. To this day, the Kingsburg plant serves as the international headquarters of Sun-Maid Growers of California, but the corporate headquarters is located in Fresno, California.

In 2012, Sun-Maid celebrated its 100th anniversary as a grower cooperative.

==Sun-Maid Girl==

The original &quot;Sun-Maid Girl&quot; was a real person named Lorraine Collett. She attended the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco as one of several young girls representing the California Associated Raisin Company. The Sun-Maid girls promoted the raisin industry by handing out raisin samples to visitors of the Expo while wearing white blouses with blue piping and blue sunbonnets.

A photograph of Collett appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot; in 1915 and promoted Sun-Maid’s activities at the Exposition. While working at the Expo in San Francisco, Collett posed at the Post Street studio of artist Fanny Scafford in the morning, and then spent the rest of the day working the Expo, where the Sun-Maid girls were by then all wearing red bonnets. The artist experimented with a variety of positions and props, finally settling on the pose with an overflowing tray of grapes and a glowing sunburst in the background.

In May 1916, company executives agreed Collett would become the personification of the company. Her image with the sunbonnet and the tray of grapes was updated in 1956 and again in 1970, using drawings made a decade earlier of company employee Delia von Meyer (Pacheco). Collett continued to make special appearances as the original Sun-Maid Girl until her death at the age of 90.

The current version was created in 1970 by John Lichtenwalner, a freelance commercial artist in San Francisco. Lichtenwalner, a graduate of Art Center in Los Angeles, used the previous versions of the Sun-Maid Girl to create a cleaner version of the character. The model for the updated portrait was a young actress/model, Liz Weide. The portrait was centered over a figurative sunburst. The artwork, sold as piecework to the Sun-Maid Raisin Co., has been reproduced internationally and is perhaps the artist&#x27;s best-known work, unchanged for more than 40 years.

In 2006, the Sun-Maid Girl was animated for television commercials in which she walked and talked for the first time. The commercials were designed and produced by Synthespian Studios.

<doc id="1145369" wikidata="Q239725" url="?curid=1145369" title="Black House (novel)">
<text>Black House is a horror (collaborative) novel by American writers Stephen King and Peter Straub. Published in 2001, it is the sequel to &quot;The Talisman&quot;.
This is one of King&#x27;s numerous novels, such as &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Insomnia&quot;, which tie in with the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. &quot;Black House&quot; was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel.

The novel is set in Straub&#x27;s homeland of Wisconsin, rather than in King&#x27;s frequently used backdrop of Maine. The town of &quot;French Landing&quot; is a fictionalized version of Trempealeau, Wisconsin. Many nearby areas are mentioned, such as Onalaska, Sparta, and Madison, or fictionalized, such as La Riviere for La Crosse, Arden for Arcadia, and Centralia, named for nearby Centerville, located at the intersection of Hwy 93 and Hwy 35. A chapter of the book is written around Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;.

In 2023, King has expressed the possibility of finally writing the third installment of &quot;The Talisman&quot; series despite the passing of Peter Straub, saying: &quot;Before he died, Peter sent me this long letter and said we oughta do the third one, and he gave me a really cool idea and I had some ideas of my own.&quot; Later, in January 2025, King confirmed he had started writing the third book, tentatively titled &quot;Talisman 3&quot;.

==Plot summary==

A series of murders has begun to plague the town of French Landing, Wisconsin. The murderer is dubbed &quot;The Fisherman,&quot; due to a conscious effort by the killer to emulate the methods of serial killer Albert Fish. Like Fish, French Landing&#x27;s killer targets children and indulges in cannibalism of the bodies. Two victims have already been discovered as the story opens, with a third awaiting discovery. The nature of the crimes, and the local police&#x27;s inability to capture the killer, have led people all over the region to become more anxious with each passing day, and certain elements of the local media exacerbate the situation with inflammatory and provocative coverage.

After the events of &quot;The Talisman&quot;, Jack Sawyer has repressed the memories of his adventures in &quot;The Territories&quot; and his hunt for the Talisman as a twelve-year-old boy, though the residue of these events has served to subtly affect his life even after he has forgotten them. Jack grew up to become a lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department, where his professionalism and uncanny talent have helped him establish a nearly legendary reputation. When a series of murders in Los Angeles are traced to a farm insurance salesman from French Landing, Wisconsin, Jack cooperates with the French Landing police to capture the killer. While in Wisconsin, Jack is irresistibly enraptured by the natural beauty of the Coulee Country, echoing his reaction to The Territories as a child. When he later intrudes upon a homicide investigation in Santa Monica, certain aspects of the crime scene threaten to revive his repressed memories. He subsequently resigns from the LAPD, moving to French Landing to enjoy his early retirement.

When the Fisherman begins to terrorize French Landing, the police all but beg &quot;Hollywood&quot; Jack Sawyer for his assistance and are surprised when he flatly refuses. Memories of the Santa Monica event threaten to overwhelm Jack, and he fears that involving himself in the investigation may affect his sanity. When a fourth child is taken by the Fisherman, events no longer allow Jack to remain aloof. It quickly becomes apparent to him that the Fisherman is much more than a serial killer. In fact, he is an agent of the Crimson King, and his task is to find children with the potential to serve as Breakers. The fourth victim, Tyler Marshall, is one of the most powerful Breakers there has ever been, and he may be all the Crimson King needs to break the remaining beams of the Dark Tower and bring an end to all worlds. As the Fisherman also proves capable of &quot;flipping&quot; into The Territories, Jack Sawyer is the only hope of not just French Landing, but of all existence.

==Terms==
* Abbalah: The Crimson King.
* Coppiceman: A word that Jack uses to refer to policemen, most notably himself. The word was taken from Wolf&#x27;s erroneous pronunciation of policeman in the previous book, &quot;The Talisman&quot;.
* D&#x27;Yamba: A magic word Jack uses that invokes the power of good.
* Opopanax: Jack is almost haunted by the word opopanax at the beginning of the story. Its meaning is given as: &quot;describing a word that cannot be found in the dictionary.&quot; It is also the name of the feather in &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; that is used to summon the Calla folken to a palaver - and also passed to anyone desiring to speak during the palaver. 
*Twinner: A twinner is a person&#x27;s counterpart or double in another world. In the language of the Territories, &quot;twinner&quot; translates as &quot;harp,&quot; which in Jack&#x27;s mind conjures the image of two strings &quot;a finger touch away&quot;.

<text>Symphonic metal is a cross-generic style designation for the symphonic subsets of heavy metal music subgenres. It is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements. The style features the heavy drums and guitars of metal with different elements of orchestral classical music, such as symphonic instruments, choirs and sometimes a full orchestra, or just keyboard orchestration.

Symphonic metal bands can feature classically trained vocalists, in which case they can be attributed nicknames such as opera metal or operatic metal. Perhaps the most prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Swedish band Therion, Finnish band Nightwish, German band Xandria, Italian band Rhapsody of Fire, American bands Lorna Shore and Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Dutch bands Epica and Within Temptation. Those bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. Many people who participate in this genre of metal music have a degree in musical thought or have been taught how to sing in a classical style.

==Musical characteristics==
The metal subgenres most typically featuring a subset of symphonic bands are gothic metal, power metal, black metal, death metal and classic heavy metal. As with many other metal bands, those adopting a symphonic style may feature influences from several metal subgenres.
Music workstation keyboards and orchestras are often a key feature of the style, distinguishing symphonic from non-symphonic bands within the same metal subgenre. Other instruments, including guitars, bass and drums, may at times play relatively simple parts in contrast to the complex and nuanced keyboard and/or orchestral parts. Bands that do not use live orchestral instrumentation on their recordings or when playing live typically utilize factory presets on workstation keyboards (i. e., strings, choirs, pianos, pipe organs, etc.) to conjure up a &quot;pseudo-orchestral&quot; sound, where parts are played idiomatically according to keyboard technique. This is particularly characteristic of lesser-known bands on tighter budgets. Some symphonic metal bands abstain from using keyboards entirely, preferring to use orchestral backing tracks pre-recorded by a live symphony orchestra and/or choir during an album session, or recorded using virtual software instruments in a sequencer. This is particularly characteristic of bands that feature deeper and more complex arrangements which could be more difficult for one or two keyboardists to reproduce faithfully in a live performance.

It is more difficult to generalize about the role of the classic metal instruments (guitars, bass and drums), as they vary depending on the metal subgenre to which the symphonic band mostly associates. With varying frequency, symphonic bands may employ these instruments (as well as the lead vocals) to play more simple, catchy melodies than non-symphonic bands, which arguably make the symphonic metal style one of the most accessible in metal.

Songs are often highly atmospheric, though more upbeat than those of many non-symphonic metal bands; songs with morbid themes routinely feature prominent major-key fanfares. Particularly central to creating mood and atmosphere is the choice of keyboard timbre.

Lyrics cover a broad range of topics. As with two of its often overlapping elements, power metal and opera (including symphonic progressive rock), fantasy and mythological themes are common. Concept albums styled after operas or epic poems are not uncommon.
Bands in this genre may often feature a female lead vocalist, usually a soprano. Male vocalists (baritone or bass-baritone), are also common in gothic metal. Growling, death-metal-style vocals are not unknown but tend to be used less frequently than in other metal subgenres (a notable exception being Mark Jansen in Epica). Backing vocals, often consisting of a choral ensemble or full choir, may be employed.

It is common for bands, particularly female-fronted bands, to feature operatic lead vocals. Such bands may be referred to as &quot;operatic symphonic metal&quot; and include the likes of Epica, Nightwish (Tarja Turunen, then Floor Jansen), Haggard, Therion, Operatika, Dremora, Dol Ammad, Visions of Atlantis, Aesma Daeva, and Almora, among countless others. The operatic style is not tied exclusively to symphonic metal, but may appear in avant-garde metal, progressive metal and gothic metal. Many bands featuring operatic female vocalists also have a male vocalist who uses harsh vocals for contrast, in a vocal style often referred to as &quot;beauty and the beast&quot;.

==Origins and evolution==
Among the first rock bands to use orchestral elements were Deep Purple, with &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, a three-movement epic performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Moody Blues, with &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, and the Nice, with &quot;Five Bridges&quot;. Black Sabbath followed suit with &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; and &quot;Supertzar&quot;. Other bands began to experiment with heavier songs with arrangements, such as &quot;Ma Ma Ma Belle&quot; by Electric Light Orchestra. Symphonic metal can be traced to some early death metal and gothic metal bands who made use of symphonic elements in their music, notably Swiss extreme metal pioneers Celtic Frost, using French horn on their 1985 release &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; (which inspired the naming of symphonic metal pioneers Therion) and more prominent symphonic orchestra on their 1987 album &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;. NWOBHM band Golgotha&#x27;s &quot;Orchestral Stab&quot; (1988)later remixed as &quot;Unmaker of Worlds&quot; (1990)also combined metal and heavily orchestrated sections.

An early prototypical symphonic metal song was &quot;Dies Irae&quot; by American Christian thrash metal group Believer. Appearing on their 1990 album &quot;Sanity Obscure&quot;, it foreshadowed the operatic approach used by the bands Therion and Nightwish. According to Jeff Wagner in his book &quot;Mean Deviation&quot;, the song was a creative watershed in metal, and except for Mekong Delta, no other extreme metal band at the time had merged the genre with classical music so seamlessly. The gothic metal band Saviour Machine, which formed in 1989 and released its first studio album in 1993, has also been referred to as symphonic metal.

The band Therion were influential in forming the genre through their use of a live orchestra and classical compositional techniques; gradually these elements became a more important part of Therion&#x27;s music than their death metal roots. Another key early influence was Finnish progressive metal band Waltari&#x27;s album &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C&quot;. In mid-1996 Rage released &quot;Lingua Mortis&quot;, the band&#x27;s first collaboration with the Prague Symphony Orchestra.

Nightwish, Rhapsody of Fire and Within Temptation all released their first album in 1997. Within Temptation&#x27;s sound was usually defined as gothic metal, being overall simpler than Nightwish&#x27;s power metal, but both bands shared two frequent symphonic metal elements: powerful female lead vocals from Tarja Turunen and Sharon den Adel respectively, and the heavy use of classically influenced keyboard playing. Haggard, which started as a progressive death metal band, had released some demos and EPs in their early years in a simple death metal style, but in 1997 went a step forward. They changed their style to a mix of classical music with real classical and medieval instruments such as violin, viola, cello, flute, oboe, clarinet, crumhorn, keyboards and death metal, releasing their first symphonic metal studio album.

Many new symphonic bands appeared or came to wide attention in the early to mid 2000s, including Rain Fell Within, After Forever, Epica, Delain, Leaves&#x27; Eyes, Xandria, and Edenbridge, all featuring female vocals and the characteristic keyboards. Power metal, with its relatively upbeat fantasy themes and stylized keyboard sounds, tended to be an important influence on these groups.

The term &quot;symphonic metal&quot; has sometimes been applied to individual songs or albums by bands that belong primarily to the basic, non-symphonic style of their subgenre. However, the term is sometimes used to describe stylistic elements increasingly present in a growing number of metal music subgenres.

==The symphonic style in metal subgenres==

The term &quot;symphonic metal&quot; denotes any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements; &quot;symphonic metal&quot; then is not so much a subgenre but rather a cross-generic designation. A few bands simply refer to themselves as &quot;symphonic metal&quot;, particularly Aesma Daeva, and the term is applied by some to generically ambiguous metal bands like Epica and post-2002 Nightwish. Following heavy metal&#x27;s tradition of classifying its subgenres based on the differences among the musical structures in the electric, &quot;metal&quot; part of bands&#x27; sound, the label &quot;symphonic&quot; is usually prefixed to the subgenre to which a band mostly belongs. No &quot;symphonic metal&quot; band being simply symphonic, a subgenre definition could be attributable to any bands simply defining themselves as symphonic metal. Symphonic heavy metal and symphonic gothic metal bands are the main objects of such neglect of classification, originating the misperception of &quot;symphonic metal&quot; as a coherent and separated metal subgenre excluding symphonic black, death, and power metal bands. Symphonic elements are often implemented in songs by bands of other subgenres.

===Symphonic black metal===

Symphonic black metal has similar components as melodic black metal, but uses keyboarding or instruments normally found in symphonic or classical music. It can also include black metal bands that make heavy usage of atmospheric keyboarding in the music, akin to symphonic metal or gothic metal. The symphonic aspects of this genre are normally integral parts of a band, and as such are commonly used throughout the whole duration of a song. The prototypical symphonic black metal bands are Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, Emperor and Carach Angren.

===Symphonic power metal===

Symphonic power metal refers to power metal bands that make extensive usage of keyboards, or instruments normally found in classical music, similar to symphonic metal. These additional elements are often used as key elements of the music when compared to regular power metal, contributing not only an extra layer to the music, but a greater variety of sound. Bands in this genre often feature clean vocals, with some bands adding relatively small quantities of screams or growls.

The first prototypical symphonic power metal song was &quot;Art of Life&quot;, a twenty-nine-minute song performed by Japanese heavy metal band X Japan in 1993. A defining role for the style&#x27;s development was played by Italian band Rhapsody of Fire since their groundbreaking 1997 debut, &quot;Legendary Tales&quot;, first with a baroque approach influenced by Vivaldi and Paganini, and subsequently with a growing film-score-oriented turn employing full orchestras and choirs. The influence of symphonic and operatic music are equally audible in cognate bands Luca Turilli&#x27;s Rhapsody and Turilli / Lione Rhapsody. Rhapsody&#x27;s contributions to symphonic metal are best exemplified by short songs like &quot;Emerald Sword&quot;, &quot;Dawn of Victory&quot; and &quot;Lamento Eroico&quot;, and long suites such as &quot;Gargoyles, Angels of Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Mystic Prophecy of the Demonknight&quot; and &quot;Erian&#x27;s Mystical Rhymes&quot;. Finnish band Nightwish, who debuted the same year, also performed symphonic power metal, their style being well exemplified by songs like &quot;Wishmaster&quot; from the album &quot;Wishmaster&quot; and the rest of their discography until the year 2000. Since the album &quot;Century Child&quot;, they gradually decreased their power metal influences, with songs like &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; from the album &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&quot; from the album &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; from the album &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot; as the best examples of their new course making a more extensive use of orchestral elements.

German band Blind Guardian also introduced some symphonic elements in the album &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;, although it wasn&#x27;t until 2002 with &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; when they established their symphonic power metal style, mainly with the song &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot;. They gradually composed more and more symphonic songs such as &quot;Sacred Worlds&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, both featured on the album &quot;At the Edge of Time&quot;, and &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, &quot;At the Edge of Time&quot;, &quot;The Throne&quot; and &quot;Grand Parade&quot; from their latest album, &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot;. They also made orchestral versions of previously released songs like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;, both included on the compilation album &quot;The Forgotten Tales&quot;. Blind Guardian went deeper into symphonic music with the album &quot;Legacy of the Dark Lands&quot;, a fully orchestral album composed by singer Hansi Kürsch and guitarist André Olbrich that kept the band&#x27;s spirit but was credited to the Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra, as Hansi was the only member of the band to perform on the album.

===Symphonic gothic metal===
Symphonic gothic metal was first pioneered by American band Saviour Machine. One of the first gothic metal bands to release a full album featuring &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; vocals, where death metal vocals are contrasted with clean female vocals, was the Norwegian Theatre of Tragedy in 1995. From then on after the departure of lead singer Liv Kristine in 2003, she and her future husband, Alexander Krull, formed the symphonic metal band Leaves&#x27; Eyes. The band is one of the pioneers of the &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; vocal style. The contrasting styles of vocals are also sometimes performed by only one vocalist, an example of this being Ambre Vourvahis of Xandria, combining and layering her clean (and occasionally operatic) vocals with her deep gutturals on the band&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;The Wonders Still Awaiting&quot;. Other bands, such as the Dutch Within Temptation in 1996, expanded on this approach. A debut album, &quot;Enter&quot;, was unveiled in the following year, followed shortly by an EP, &quot;The Dance&quot;. Both releases made use of the beauty-and-beast approach delivered by vocalists Sharon den Adel and Robert Westerholt. Their second full-length, &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, was released in 2000 and dispensed entirely with the death metal vocals, instead &quot;relying solely on den Adel&#x27;s majestic vocal ability&quot;, apart from one B-side track that did not make the final album release. The album was a commercial success, with their lead single, &quot;Ice Queen&quot;, topping the charts in Belgium and their native Netherlands. Their third album, &quot;The Silent Force&quot;, arrived in 2004 as an &quot;ambitious project featuring a full orchestra and 80-voice choir accompanying the band&quot;. The result was another commercial success across Europe and introduced &quot;the world of heavy guitars and female vocals&quot; to &quot;a mainstream audience&quot;.

Within Temptation&#x27;s brand of gothic metal combines &quot;the guitar-driven force of hard rock with the sweep and grandeur of symphonic music&quot;. The critic Chad Bowar of About.com describes their style as &quot;the optimum balance&quot; between &quot;the melody and hooks of mainstream rock, the depth and complexity of classical music and the dark edge of gothic metal&quot;. The commercial success of Within Temptation has since resulted in the emergence of a large number of other female-fronted gothic metal bands, particularly in the Netherlands. A typical example of their most symphonic sound can be heard in the songs &quot;Jillian (I&#x27;d give my Heart)&quot; and &quot;Our Solemn Hour&quot;.

Another Dutch band in the symphonic gothic metal strain is After Forever. Their debut album, &quot;Prison of Desire&quot; in 2000, was &quot;a courageous, albeit flawed first study into an admittedly daunting undertaking: to wed heavy metal with progressive rock arrangements and classical music orchestration - then top it all off with equal parts gruesome cookie-monster vocals and a fully qualified opera singer&quot;. Founding member, guitarist and vocalist Mark Jansen departed After Forever a few months after the release of their second album, &quot;Decipher&quot;. Jansen would go on to form Epica, another Dutch band that performs a blend of gothic and symphonic metal. Their debut album, &quot;The Phantom Agony&quot;, emerged in 2003 with music that combines Jansen&#x27;s death grunts with the &quot;angelic tones of a classically trained soprano, Simone Simons, over a lush foundation of symphonic power metal&quot;. The music of Epica has been described as combination of &quot;a dark, haunting gothic atmosphere with bombastic and symphonic music&quot;. Like Within Temptation and After Forever, Epica has made use of an orchestra. Their 2007 album &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot; was a chart success in their home country.

This blend of symphonic and gothic metal has also been arrived at from the opposite direction. The band Nightwish from Finland began as a symphonic power metal act and introduced gothic elements on their 2004 album &quot;Once&quot;, particularly on the single &quot;Nemo&quot;. They continued to mix their style of &quot;bombastic, symphonic and cinematic&quot; metal with a gothic atmosphere on their next album, &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, in 2007. The Swedish group Therion also introduced gothic elements to their brand of symphonic metal on their 2007 album &quot;Gothic Kabbalah&quot;.

=== Symphonic death metal ===

Bands described as symphonic death metal include Ex Deo, Septicflesh, Children of Bodom, MaYaN, and Fleshgod Apocalypse. Haggard&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Awaking the Centuries&quot;, has been described as death metal–styled symphonic metal. Eternal Tears of Sorrow adds gothic/symphonic elements to melodic death metal. Mechina combines symphonic death metal with industrial metal.

The symphonic death metal scene includes deathcore bands mixing the two genres together, starting in the late 2000s with Winds of Plague. In the early 2010s, Make Them Suffer developed the symphonic deathcore subgenre further in their earlier material, as did Betraying the Martyrs, known to &quot;temper the punishing brutality of deathcore with melodic flourishes pulled from symphonic and progressive metal, giving it a theatricality that feels distinctly European.&quot; It was not until the late 2010s and early 2020s when the symphonic deathcore scene started rising in popularity with bands like Shadow of Intent, Lorna Shore, and A Wake in Providence. Carnifex in their later albums and Mental Cruelty combine the genre with symphonic black metal.

<text>A snubber is a device used to suppress (&quot;&quot;) a phenomenon such as voltage transients in electrical systems, pressure transients in fluid systems (caused by for example water hammer) or excess force or rapid movement in mechanical systems.

==Electrical systems==
Snubbers are frequently used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow leads to a large counter-electromotive force: a rise in voltage across the current switching device that opposes the change in current, in accordance with Faraday&#x27;s law. This transient can be a source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be safely discharged. Inductive elements are often unintentional, arising from the current loops implied by physical circuitry like long and/or tortuous wires. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches, or electrical interference, or the welding of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).

===Resistor-capacitor (RC) ===


A simple RC snubber uses a small resistor (R) in series with a small capacitor (C). This combination can be used to suppress the rapid rise in voltage across a thyristor, preventing the erroneous turn-on of the thyristor; it does this by limiting the rate of rise in voltage ( formula_1 ) across the thyristor to a value which will not trigger it. An appropriately designed RC snubber can be used with either DC or AC loads. This sort of snubber is commonly used with inductive loads such as electric motors. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so a decreasing transient current will flow through it for a fraction of a second, allowing the voltage across the switch to increase more slowly when the switch is opened. Determination of voltage rating can be difficult owing to the nature of transient waveforms, and may be defined simply by the power rating of the snubber components and the application. RC snubbers can be made discretely and are also built as a single component (see also Boucherot cell).

===Diodes===

When the current flowing is DC, a simple rectifier diode is often employed as a snubber. The snubber diode is wired in parallel with an inductive load (such as a relay coil or electric motor). The diode is installed so that it does not conduct under normal conditions. When the external driving current is interrupted, the inductor current flows instead through the diode. The stored energy of the inductor is then gradually dissipated by the diode voltage drop and the resistance of the inductor itself. One disadvantage of using a simple rectifier diode as a snubber is that the diode allows current to continue flowing for some time, causing the inductor to remain active for slightly longer than desired. When such a snubber is utilized in a relay, this effect may cause a significant delay in the &quot;drop out&quot;, or disengagement, of the actuator.

The diode must immediately enter into forward conduction mode as the driving current is interrupted. Most ordinary diodes, even &quot;slow&quot; power silicon diodes, are able to turn on very quickly, in contrast to their slow reverse recovery time. These are sufficient for snubbing electromechanical devices such as relays and motors.

In high-speed cases, where the switching is faster than 10 nanoseconds, such as in certain switching power regulators, &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;ultrafast&quot;, or Schottky diodes may be required.

===Resistor-capacitor-diode===
More sophisticated designs use a diode with an RC network.

===Solid-state devices===
In some DC circuits, a varistor made of inexpensive metal oxide, called a metal oxide varistor (MOV) is used. 

They may be unipolar or bipolar, like two inverse-series silicon Zener diodes, but are prone to wear out after about a dozen max-rated joules of energy absorption such as lightning protection, but are suitable for lower energy. 

Now with lower series resistance (Rs) in semiconductors they are generally called transient voltage suppressors (TVS), or surge protection devices (SPD).

Transient voltage suppressors (TVS) may be used instead of the simple diode. The coil diode clamp makes the relay turn off slower ( formula_2 ) and thus increases contact arc if with a motor load which also needs a snubber. The diode clamp works well for coasting a uni-directional motor to a stop, but for bi-directional motors, a bipolar TVS is used. 

A higher voltage Zener-like TVS may make the relay open faster than it would with a simple rectifier diode clamp, as R is higher while the voltage rises to the clamp level. A Zener diode connected to ground will protect against positive transients that go over the Zener&#x27;s breakdown voltage, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal forward diode drop. 

Transient-voltage-suppression diodes are like silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) which trigger from overvoltage then clamp like Darlington transistors for lower voltage drop over a longer time period. 

In AC circuits a rectifier diode snubber cannot be used; if a simple RC snubber is not adequate a more complex bidirectional snubber design must be used.

==Mechanical and hydraulic systems==
Snubbers for pipes and equipment are used to control movement during abnormal conditions such as earthquakes, turbine trips, safety valve closure, relief valve closure, or hydraulic fuse closure. Snubbers allow for free thermal movement of a component during regular conditions, but restrain the component in irregular conditions. A hydraulic snubber allows for pipe deflection under normal operating conditions. When subjected to an impulse load, the snubber becomes activated and acts as a restraint in order to restrict pipe movement. A mechanical snubber uses mechanical means to provide the restraint force.

<text>Maria Anna/Anna Marie &quot;Nanny&quot; Adamberger (23 October 1752 – 5 November 1807), born Jaquet, was an Austrian actress. She played &quot;ingénue&quot; roles in comedies and originated the role of Madame Vogelsang in &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; (&quot;The Impresario&quot;) by Mozart.

== Career ==
Adamberger received her training from her father, actor Karl J. Jacquet (1726–1813). She started playing in the &quot;Theater nächst der Burg&quot; (&quot;Theatre Next to the Castle&quot;) in 1760, at the age of 8, and became a member of the company in 1768, aged 16. After playing some tragic roles and not being satisfied with the success she achieved in them, she decided to perform only in comedies.

She became known as an excellent &quot;ingénue&quot; playing the roles of naïve or lively and whimsical young women in comedies and achieved considerable success and fame. In 1786, she originated the spoken role of Madame Vogelsang in Woflgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s (&quot;The Impresario&quot;), playing opposite of her husband as Monsieur Vogelsang. She retired in 1798, aged 46, her last role being that of Gurli in (&quot;Indians in England&quot;). 

Adamberger remained a favourite of audiences throughout her whole career, and contemporary Viennese poets such as Heinrich Joseph von Collin wrote many poems praising her. She was one of the first actors whose picture was included in the (&quot;Gallery of Honour&quot;) of the company, depicting her in her role as Rofine in (&quot;The Lawyer and the Peasant&quot;). Ernst Brandes wrote about her that &quot;it would not be possible&quot; to play a mischievous peasant woman or a naughty city girl in a &quot;truer and more endearing&quot; way. He described her as charming with a &quot;gracefully built&quot; body and a pleasant face, her facial expressions as admirable. She also had a technique for delivering confessions that her character did not want to make: she bit down on the words in a very natural way.

According to Mener, she belonged &quot;only in &quot;, a specifically German and bourgeois type of comedy as opposed to the French courtly comedies of Molière and the coarser genres of (&quot;farce with singing&quot;) and . He also asserted that whoever saw her play in &quot;forgot that there could be anything outside of the comedy&quot; and that she could &quot;entertain the mind, move the heart and delight the soul&quot;. He agreed that she was &quot;unique, peculiar, inimitable and charming&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Adamberger was born on 23 October 1752 in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria, the daughter of court actor Karl J. Jaquet (1726–1813). She had a younger sister, Katharina (1760–1786). from an early age, her father wanted her to become an actress, and trained her himself. She married operatic tenor (Josef) Valentin Adamberger &quot;Valentino Adamonti&quot; (1743–1804) in 1781 and had one daughter with him, actress Antonie &quot;Toni&quot; von Arnet (born Adamberger) (1790–1867), born 31 December 1790. Maria was widowed in 1804 and died on 5 November 1807 in Vienna, aged 55.

<text>Arrecife (; ; ) is the capital city and a municipality of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. It was made the island&#x27;s capital in 1852. The city owes its name to the rock reef (&quot;arrecife&quot; being Spanish for &quot;reef&quot;) which covers its local beach. It also gives its name to the nearby Arrecife Airport. The population of the municipality was 64,645 in 2020. Its area is .

Arrecife is located south of Teguise and east of San Bartolomé, and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to its southeast. It is a port town, served by ferries to the other Canary Islands, Europe, and Africa. The LZ1 road connects Arrecife to the northeast of the island, the LZ2 road connects it to the southwest, and the LZ3 road serves as the city&#x27;s beltway. The tallest building in Lanzarote is the Arrecife Gran Hotel, which is located on the seafront alongside the harbour.

== History ==
The earliest records of Arrecife date from the fifteenth century when it was a small fishing settlement. The name, given then as &quot;Arrecifes&quot;, refers to the black volcanic reefs behind which boats could hide, protected from sudden pirate attacks.

Towards the end of the sixteenth century the settlement began to grow in response to a need for accommodation and warehousing to support growing trade between the old and new worlds. The first church was constructed at this time, consecrated to the first bishop of Arrecife, &quot;San Ginés&quot;. Growing prosperity increased the attractiveness of the town as a pirate target: in 1571 a pirate named &quot;Dogan&quot; plundered and almost completely destroyed the little port town.

In 1964 Arrecife became the site of Lanzarote&#x27;s first sea-water desalination plant.

== Climate ==
Arrecife has a tropical hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen climate classification. The little precipitation is concentrated in the winter months.

== Historical population ==
==Economy==
The Port of Arrecife is the main port facility for Lanzarote and the second busiest in the Canary Islands in terms of passengers. It handles passenger ferries, cruise ships, and ro-ro cargo, but also bulk, breakbulk, containers, and liquid bulk, and has a large fishing port.

<text>Unode is a short form of underground node: a script or program that combines other programs for creating a decentralized anonymous encrypted communication network. Other programs include: Entropy, Mixmaster, GPG, NEWSPOST, plus Plugins for more.

Unode is a project to create a set of bash scripts to help Activists communicate without revealing their IP, or other personal data.

Some of these scripts are used to forward email lists to the newsgroup alt.activism.underground. By doing this, activists can read important action alerts and other information without being included on the servers email lists that run the lists. Email headers are removed from these posts, as well as email addresses themselves are altered to help avoid spam.

Unix bash scripts are used because it is easy for other to alter or correct errors in the scripts, and because it is an easy way to try out new ideas. It is used as a rough draft, before the eventual move to stable binary programs.

<text>Edward Brewster Sheldon (February 4, 1886, in Chicago, Illinois – April 1, 1946, in New York City) was an American dramatist. His plays include &quot;Salvation Nell&quot; (1908) and &quot;Romance&quot; (1913), which was made into a motion picture with Greta Garbo.

After becoming ill at age 29 with crippling rheumatoid arthritis, which eventually claimed his sight (around 1930), Sheldon became a source of emotional and creative support for his many friends, notably Minnie Maddern Fiske (he wrote &quot;Salvation Nell&quot; for her), Julia Marlowe, John Barrymore (his closest friend and confidante), Thornton Wilder, Alexander Woollcott, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Ruth Gordon, Helen Hayes. While in hospital his advice was received by those in the theatrical profession as gospel. Actress and librettist Dorothy Donnelly formed a close friendship with Sheldon, and after he became bedridden often assisted with transcribing, editing, and supporting his work.

In May 1915 Sheldon narrowly missed sailing on the &quot;Lusitania&quot;&#x27;s infamous last voyage. He had been asked by theater impresario Charles Frohman to accompany him to England. A Harvard classmate of Sheldon&#x27;s was getting married on May 11 and asked Sheldon to be best man. Sheldon then declined Frohman&#x27;s offer.

A 1936 lawsuit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for copyright infringement claimed that the script MGM used for the 1932 motion picture &quot;Letty Lynton&quot; plagiarized material from the play &quot;Dishonored Lady&quot; by Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes. After being heard before various courts, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States as &quot;Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.&quot;; in 1940 the Supreme Court awarded a fifth of the profits. The film is still unavailable today because of this lawsuit.

His life is detailed in &quot;The Man Who Lived Twice&quot; by Eric Wollencott Barnes. In this biography Barnes states that Sheldon was in love all his adult life with Doris Keane, the actress who starred in &quot;Romance&quot; in 1913.

<text>Julian Raymond Marvin Gray (born 21 September 1979) is an English football coach and former professional player.

He played in the Football League and Premier League for Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Cardiff City, Birmingham City, Coventry City, Fulham, Barnsley and Walsall, and in Cyprus for Nea Salamis Famagusta.

==Club career==
Gray was born in Lewisham, in south London. He began his association with Arsenal as a seven-year-old, and made one substitute for the first team before making a switch across London in July 2000 to join Crystal Palace for a £500,000 fee. He is an attacking left winger who can also play as an auxiliary striker, and has learnt full-back duties so he can help out in defence. Gray played a key part in helping them achieve promotion in the 2003–04 season, despite missing the play-off final through suspension. In addition to his successes during that season he spent a two-month spell on loan with Cardiff City. One of Gray&#x27;s most memorable games for Palace was when he scored in a man-of-the-match performance as Palace surprisingly knocked Liverpool out of the 2002–03 FA Cup at Anfield.
Gray&#x27;s contract expired in June 2004, allowing him to sign for Birmingham City on a free transfer. He made 32 Premier League appearances in his first season in the Midlands, and remained a key part of manager Steve Bruce&#x27;s plans during the 2005–06 season, although an ankle injury kept him out for several weeks towards the end of the campaign, but started only twice as the team returned to the Premier League in 2007 and was released at the end of that season.

He joined Coventry City on 10 July 2007. He signed for Fulham on a season-long loan on 1 September 2008, and despite not playing a single league game for the club, the move was made permanent for an undisclosed fee on 2 February 2009. He made only one substitute appearance for Fulham, and was released at the end of the season.

In July 2009 Gray went on Sheffield United&#x27;s pre-season tour of Malta as part of a trial with the club, and the following month he had a trial with former club Cardiff City. Gray signed for Barnsley on 15 September, initially on a monthly contract. He was released after two months, during which he made seven appearances in all competitions and started only one Championship game. Gray joined Walsall in February 2010, and was offered a new deal by the club at the end of the season. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the 2–1 victory over Brentford with a volley from a Darren Byfield cross.

After leaving Walsall when his contract expired, Gray spent two seasons in Cyprus with Nea Salamis Famagusta. He returned to England in 2013, and trained with Walsall before signing a contract with them on 27 September, to run until January of the following year. Gray made his second debut for the club on 12 October, as a 71st-minute substitute for James Baxendale in a 1–1 draw away at Colchester United. He was released when his contract expired.

==Coaching career==
Gray joined the staff of Arsenal&#x27;s academy in 2019, and became under-18s assistant coach in 2021. He holds the UEFA A Licence. He was appointed as lead under-15s coach in Birmingham City&#x27;s academy in August 2024.

<doc id="1145404" wikidata="Q883484" url="?curid=1145404" title="Lead zirconate titanate">
<text>Lead zirconate titanate, also called lead zirconium titanate and commonly abbreviated as PZT, is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a ceramic perovskite material that shows a marked piezoelectric effect, meaning that the compound changes shape when an electric field is applied. It is used in a number of practical applications such as ultrasonic transducers and piezoelectric resonators. It is a white to off-white solid.

Lead zirconium titanate was first developed around 1952 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Compared to barium titanate, a previously discovered metallic-oxide-based piezoelectric material, lead zirconium titanate exhibits greater sensitivity and has a higher operating temperature. Piezoelectric ceramics are chosen for applications because of their physical strength, chemical inertness and their relatively low manufacturing cost. PZT ceramic is the most commonly used piezoelectric ceramic because it has an even greater sensitivity and higher operating temperature than other piezoceramics. Recently, there has been a large push towards finding alternatives to PZT due to legislations in many countries restricting the use of lead alloys and compounds in commercial products.

==Electroceramic properties==
Being piezoelectric, lead zirconate titanate develops a voltage (or potential difference) across two of its faces when compressed (useful for sensor applications), and physically changes shape when an external electric field is applied (useful for actuator applications). The relative permittivity of lead zirconate titanate can range from 300 to 20000, depending upon orientation and doping.

Being pyroelectric, this material develops a voltage difference across two of its faces under changing temperature conditions; consequently, lead zirconate titanate can be used as a heat sensor. Lead zirconate titanate is also ferroelectric, which means that it has a spontaneous electric polarization (electric dipole) that can be reversed in the presence of an electric field.

The material features an extremely large relative permittivity at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near &quot;x&quot; = 0.52.

Some formulations are ohmic until at least (), after which current grows exponentially with field strength before reaching avalanche breakdown; but lead zirconate titanate exhibits time-dependent dielectric breakdown — breakdown may occur under constant-voltage stress after minutes or hours, depending on voltage and temperature, so its dielectric strength depends on the time scale over which it is measured. Other formulations have dielectric strengths measured in the range.

==Uses==
Lead zirconate titanate-based materials are components of ceramic capacitors and STM/AFM actuators (tubes).

Lead zirconate titanate is used to make ultrasound transducers and other sensors and actuators, as well as high-value ceramic capacitors and FRAM chips. Lead zirconate titanate is also used in the manufacture of ceramic resonators for reference timing in electronic circuitry. Anti-flash goggles featuring PLZT protect aircrew from burns and blindness in case of a nuclear explosion. The PLZT lenses could turn opaque in less than 150 microseconds.

Commercially, it is usually not used in its pure form, rather it is doped with either acceptors, which create oxygen (anion) vacancies, or donors, which create metal (cation) vacancies and facilitate domain wall motion in the material. In general, acceptor doping creates &quot;hard&quot; lead zirconate titanate, while donor doping creates &quot;soft&quot; lead zirconate titanate. Hard and soft lead zirconate titanate generally differ in their piezoelectric constants. Piezoelectric constants are proportional to the polarization or to the electrical field generated per unit of mechanical stress, or alternatively is the mechanical strain produced by per unit of electric field applied. In general, &quot;soft&quot; lead zirconate titanate has a higher piezoelectric constant, but larger losses in the material due to internal friction. In &quot;hard&quot; lead zirconate titanate, domain wall motion is pinned by the impurities, thereby lowering the losses in the material, but at the expense of a reduced piezoelectric constant.

==Varieties==
One of the commonly studied chemical composition is . The increased piezoelectric response and poling efficiency near to &quot;x&quot; = 0.52 is due to the increased number of allowable domain states at the MPB. At this boundary, the 6 possible domain states from the tetragonal phase ⟨100⟩ and the 8 possible domain states from the rhombohedral phase ⟨111⟩ are equally favorable energetically, thereby allowing a maximum 14 possible domain states.

Like structurally similar lead scandium tantalate and barium strontium titanate, lead zirconate titanate can be used for manufacture of uncooled staring array infrared imaging sensors for thermographic cameras. Both thin film (usually obtained by chemical vapor deposition) and bulk structures are used. The formula of the material used usually approaches (called lead zirconate titanate 30/70). Its properties may be modified by doping it with lanthanum, resulting in lanthanum-doped lead zirconium titanate (lead zirconate titanate, also called lead lanthanum zirconium titanate), with formula (lead zirconate titanate 17/30/70).

<text>You Can&#x27;t Argue with a Sick Mind is a live solo album by the American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Walsh. The album was released in early 1976 as Walsh&#x27;s last album for ABC Records. It was recorded live just before Walsh joined the Eagles. Three members of that group appear on the song &quot;Help Me Through the Night&quot;.

== Recording ==
The album was compiled from recordings taken from a taping of &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;, filmed on November 26, 1975. The episode was titled &quot;Joe Walsh and Friends&quot; and featured various additional artists, including some of Walsh&#x27;s soon-to-be Eagles bandmates. Out of the six tracks on the album, five were taken from the broadcast, while &quot;Time Out&quot; was a new release. Songs performed on the episode that did not appear on the album included Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Club,&quot; Barnstorm&#x27;s &quot;Mother Says,&quot; and covers of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; and the Spencer Davis Groups&#x27; &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic James Chrispell wrote of the album &quot;Recorded live just before Joe Walsh joined up with the Eagles full-time... you&#x27;ve got one heck of a Joe Walsh concert souvenir.&quot;

==Release history==
The album was reissued in 1979 by MCA Records. In 2011 the album was reissued in Japan in a miniature replica sleeve in the SHM-CD format.
