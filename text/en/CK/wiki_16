<text>Yinz (see below for other spellings) is a second-person plural pronoun used mainly in Western Pennsylvania English. It is most prominent in Pittsburgh, but it is also found throughout the cultural region known as Appalachia, located within the geographical region of the Appalachians.

==History and usage==
&quot;Yinz&quot; is a derivation from the original Scots-Irish forms &quot;Yin(s)&quot; (meaning &#x27;One(s)) and related contractions of &quot;you ones&quot;, &quot;yous ones&quot; and &quot;ye &#x27;uns&quot;, a form of the second-person plural that is commonly heard in Scotland, Ulster and parts of Ireland and Northern England. In the first- and third-person, standard English speakers use distinct pronouns to denote singular and plural. In the first person, for example, speakers use the singular &quot;I&quot; and the plural &quot;we&quot;. However, the second-person pronoun &quot;you&quot; performs a double duty since it is both the singular form and the plural form. Crozier (1984) suggests that during the 19th century, when many Irish-speakers switched to speaking English, they filled that gap with &quot;you ones&quot;, primarily because Irish has both the singular second-person pronoun &quot;tú&quot; and the plural form &quot;sibh&quot;. The following, therefore, is the most likely path from &quot;you ones&quot; to &quot;yinz&quot;: &quot;you ones&quot; &gt; &quot;you&#x27;uns&quot; &gt; &quot;youns&quot; &gt; &quot;yunz&quot; &gt; &quot;yinz&quot; . Because there are still speakers who use each form, there is no stable second-person plural pronoun form in the southwest or central Pennsylvania area, so the pronoun is variably referred to or spelled as you&#x27;uns, y&#x27;ins, y&#x27;uns, yunz, yuns, yinz, yenz, yins, or ynz.

In other parts of the United States, similarly regional British, Irish and Scots-Irish speakers brought over different dialectal second-person plural forms. Examples include &quot;yunz&quot;, which is used in and around Middletown, Pennsylvania; &quot;youse&quot;, which is found mainly in New York City and Chicago, the Philadelphia dialect and New Jersey; and &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, which is ubiquitous in the South.

A similar form with similar Irish and Scots roots is found in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. Rarely written, it is spelled &quot;yous&quot; and is usually pronounced as or something between and . It is sometimes combined with &quot;all&quot; for emphasis, as in, &quot;are yous all coming to the party?&quot; That usage is also common within Carbon and Schuylkill Counties, Pennsylvania.

==In popular culture==
Being one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s most famous regionalisms makes &quot;yinz&quot; a badge of pride. For example, a group of Pittsburgh area radical cheerleaders call themselves &quot;Yinz Cheer&quot;, and an area literary magazine was called &quot;The New Yinzer&quot;, a take-off of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Those perceived to be stereotypical blue collar Pittsburgh residents are often referred to as &quot;Yinzers&quot;.

Yinztagram is a software program with a Pittsburgh theme.

YinzCam is a Pittsburgh-based software development company.

At the end of every episode of &quot;VH-1&#x27;s Top 20 Countdown&quot;, host Jim Shearer always says &quot;I&#x27;m Jim Shearer, and I&#x27;ll see yinz later.&quot;

In the TV series &quot;One Dollar&quot; (2018), set in a rust belt town (shot in and around Pittsburgh), the Yinz address is frequently used.

Waypoint YINZZ in Newell, West Virginia marks the approach to Pittsburgh International Airport.

<text>The 1952 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 22 June 1952 at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 3 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used.

==Report==
Maserati&#x27;s new A6GCM was still not ready, and, to compound this, their lead driver Juan Manuel Fangio had suffered back injuries at the non-championship Monza Grand Prix. This meant that Ferrari were once again favoured for success in the race, with their driver lineup consisting of Alberto Ascari (in place of André Simon), Nino Farina and Piero Taruffi. There were also two privateer Ferrari entries: local driver Charles de Tornaco of Ecurie Francorchamps, and Louis Rosier. The Gordini team expanded their lineup to include Belgian driver Johnny Claes, alongside Behra, Manzon and Bira. American Robert O&#x27;Brien also drove a Simca-Gordini for this race. HWM also recruited a pair of Belgian drivers — Paul Frère and Roger Laurent — who raced alongside regular drivers Peter Collins and Lance Macklin. Stirling Moss switched from HWM to ERA for this race. A handful of other privateer entrants also took part, including future World Champion Mike Hawthorn, who made his debut in a Cooper-Bristol.

Ascari headed an all-Ferrari front row, with teammates Farina and Taruffi in second and third, respectively. The Gordinis of Manzon and Behra made up row two, while the third row consisted of Hawthorn, Ken Wharton (in a Frazer-Nash), and Frère, who was the highest qualifier of the five Belgian drivers on the grid.

Taruffi started badly in the rain, dropping to ninth by the end of the first lap, while Behra overhauled the two leading Ferraris to take the lead of the race. Moss also started well, before his car broke down halfway through the first lap. Behra&#x27;s lead was short-lived, as both Ascari and Farina overtook him on the second lap, subsequently holding first and second for the remainder of the race. Behra dropped to fourth when the recovering Taruffi passed him on lap 13. On the following lap Taruffi spun at Malmédy and Behra hit him, causing both to retire. Manzon overtook Hawthorn to assume what was now third place. Despite suffering from fuel leakage problems, Hawthorn was able to maintain fourth place until the end of the race. His fellow debutant Paul Frère also finished in the points, in fifth.

Ascari&#x27;s win (with fastest lap), and Taruffi&#x27;s retirement, meant that the two now shared the lead of the Championship, on nine points each. Indianapolis 500 winner Troy Ruttman was in third, while Farina&#x27;s second-place finish raised him to fourth in the standings, three points adrift of the joint Championship leaders.

<text>The 1952 French Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 6 July 1952 at Rouen-Les-Essarts. It was race 4 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. Unusually this race was run over a duration of 3 hours, rather than a fixed distance.

==Report==
Having won the previous weekend&#x27;s Grand Prix de la Marne, Jean Behra, racing for Equipe Gordini, was among the favourites for the first French Grand Prix to be held at Rouen-Les-Essarts. Also driving for Gordini were regulars Robert Manzon and Prince Bira, alongside Maurice Trintignant, who replaced Johnny Claes from the lineup for the previous round. Claes entered the race in a Simca-Gordini under his own &#x27;Ecurie Belge&#x27; label, which he had used in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. Ferrari retained their lineup of Ascari, Farina and Taruffi, who had locked out the front row of the grid in Belgium. There were also several privateer Ferrari entries: the Swiss duo of Rudi Fischer and Peter Hirt, representing Ecurie Espadon, the Italian pairing of Franco Comotti and Piero Carini, for Scuderia Marzotto, and Louis Rosier. HWM again ran regular drivers Lance Macklin and Peter Collins, this time alongside Frenchman Yves Giraud-Cabantous. While the factory Maserati team remained absent, their new car, the A6GCM, made its World Championship debut, driven by Philippe Étancelin of Escuderia Bandeirantes. Enrico Platé entered a pair of older Maseratis, the 4CLT/48 model, for Toulo de Graffenried and Harry Schell. Completing the grid were Peter Whitehead, in a privately run Alta, and Mike Hawthorn, who again took part in a Cooper-Bristol.

Ascari took his second consecutive pole position, with his Ferrari teammates Farina and Taruffi again joining him on the front row of the grid. The Gordini team locked out the second row, with Behra and Manzon qualifying in fourth and fifth, respectively. Their teammates Trintignant and Bira started from the third row, alongside Peter Collins in the fastest of the HWMs. The new Maserati A6GCM proved a disappointment, with Philippe Étancelin only managing to qualify on the seventh row of the grid (out of eight).

The Ferraris once again dominated the race, with Alberto Ascari leading Farina from start to finish, thus taking his second consecutive victory in the World Championship. Despite a good start from the Gordinis of Manzon and Behra, that saw them take third and fourth place, respectively, by the end of the first lap, Piero Taruffi managed to regain third place on lap 4 and subsequently held it for the remainder of the race, ensuring that it was an all-Ferrari podium. Manzon finished fourth, a lap behind Taruffi, while his teammate Maurice Trintignant took the final points-scoring position of fifth. HWM driver Peter Collins took sixth, two laps behind Trintignant, ahead of Jean Behra, for whom seventh represented something of a recovery, having been in last place at the end of lap 3. His race had been compromised when he crashed and consequently needed to pit.

Ascari&#x27;s win, and fastest lap, ensured that he took a five-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, ahead of fellow Ferrari driver Piero Taruffi. Farina&#x27;s second consecutive second-place finish took him to third in the standings, one point adrift of Taruffi. Indianapolis 500 winner Troy Ruttman was a further four points behind in fourth, one point ahead of Gordini driver Robert Manzon.

==Entries==
: — Piero Taruffi qualified and drove the entire race in the #12 Ferrari. Luigi Villoresi, who was also entered in the same car, was unable to participate due to injury.

<text>The 1952 British Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 19 July 1952 at Silverstone Circuit. It was race 5 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used.

New pit facilities had been built on the straight between Woodcote and Copse corners; the original pits were located between Abbey and Woodcote.

==Report==
Jean Behra was unable to take part in the British Grand Prix, having broken his shoulder blade at the non-championship Grand Prix de Sables d&#x27;Olonne the previous weekend. Consequently, Maurice Trintignant took over Behra&#x27;s Gordini T16 for Silverstone, having driven a Simca-Gordini T15 at Rouen-Les-Essarts. The Gordini team also fielded regular drivers Robert Manzon and Prince Bira. As in the previous race, Belgian driver Johnny Claes entered a privateer Simca-Gordini under the &#x27;Ecurie Belge&#x27; moniker. Ferrari stuck with the same three drivers — Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina and Piero Taruffi — who had monopolised the podium positions at the French Grand Prix. There were also a number of privateer Ferrari entrants: Fischer and Hirt for Ecurie Espadon, Peter Whitehead and Roy Salvadori. HWM continued their policy of partnering regulars Peter Collins and Lance Macklin with a local driver, in this case Duncan Hamilton. The Connaught team ran a quartet of Lea Francis-engined entries — McAlpine, Downing, Thompson and Poore — while the remainder of the grid was made up of a series of privateers of various constructors, including Coopers and Maseratis.

The three works Ferraris, led on this occasion by Farina, again qualified in the top three positions on the grid, this time being joined on the four-car front row by Manzon. The second row consisted of Downing alongside Reg Parnell and Mike Hawthorn in a pair of Cooper-Bristols. The Connaughts of Poore and Thompson shared row three with Bira&#x27;s Gordini and Hamilton in his HWM.

Ascari took the lead at the start of the race and held onto it for the whole 85 laps, taking his third consecutive victory in the World Championship. Polesitter Nino Farina was in second place for the first 26 laps but he dropped down the field when he needed to pit to change spark plugs, eventually finishing in sixth, just outside the points. Despite making a bad start that saw him drop to ninth by the end of the first lap, fellow Ferrari driver Taruffi recovered to take second place, finishing a lap behind Ascari. Dennis Poore, who had been running in third after Farina&#x27;s pit stop, needed to make a stop of his own in order to refuel his car. This allowed Hawthorn to inherit third place, which he held for the remainder of the race. He finished a lap behind Taruffi and took his first World Championship podium in just his third race. Poore took fourth, ahead of Connaught teammate Eric Thompson in the fifth and final points position.

Ascari&#x27;s win, coupled with yet another fastest lap, allowed him to extend his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship once again. He now enjoyed an eight-point lead over fellow Ferrari driver Taruffi. Farina, having not scored any points, was seven points adrift of Taruffi.

==Entries==
: — Roy Salvadori qualified and drove the entire race in the #14 Ferrari. Bobbie Baird, named substitute driver for the car, was not used during the Grand Prix.
: — Louis Rosier and Ken Wharton both withdrew from the event prior to practice.

<text>The 1952 German Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 3 August 1952 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. It was race 6 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. The 18-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from pole position. His teammates Giuseppe Farina and Rudi Fischer finished in second and third places.

== Report ==
The Maserati factory team finally appeared with their new car, the A6GCM, which was driven by Felice Bonetto. Also racing A6GCMs were the Escuderia Bandeirantes drivers Bianco and Cantoni. Ferrari once again entered the successful trio of Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina and Piero Taruffi, while there were privateer Ferrari entries for Rudi Fischer and Rudolf Schoeller of Ecurie Espadon, Roger Laurent of Ecurie Francorchamps, and Piero Carini of Scuderia Marzotto. Jean Behra returned to action for the Gordini team, having recovered from his shoulder injury. He replaced Prince Bira, and was partnered by teammates Robert Manzon and Maurice Trintignant. HWM entered three cars, with regular Peter Collins joined by the Belgian pairing of Paul Frère and Johnny Claes, while Australian Tony Gaze drove a privateer HWM. Bill Aston drove an Aston Butterworth, and the field was completed by a plethora of privateer German cars (Veritas, AFM and BMW).

Ferrari were once again fastest in qualifying, with Ascari and Farina being joined on the front row of the grid by the Gordinis of Trintignant and Manzon. The remaining works Ferrari driver, Taruffi, started from the second row, alongside the Ecurie Espadon-entered Ferrari of Fischer and Paul Pietsch in a Veritas. Bonetto&#x27;s works Maserati made the third row, along with the Gordini of Jean Behra, and a pair of local entrants: Hans Klenk&#x27;s Veritas, and Willi Heeks in an AFM.

The race turned out to be rather a processional event, with Ascari leading Farina all the way in the first 16 laps. Two laps from home, he had to dive into the pits for oil, emerging 10 seconds behind Farina-which he rattled off on the next lap, catching Farina just a mile from home to win by several seconds after an otherwise dull race. Piero Taruffi had been running in third behind his teammates, but he lost the position to Rudi Fischer towards the end of the race when he encountered problems due to his suspension breaking. Fischer&#x27;s podium and Taruffi&#x27;s fourth place-finish ensured that it was a Ferrari 1-2-3-4. Manzon, who had been running in fourth for much of the first half of the race, between Taruffi and Fischer, was forced to retire when a wheel fell off his car. This meant that his teammate Behra was left to take the final points in fifth position in his Gordini, ahead of Roger Laurent&#x27;s Ferrari. Felice Bonetto, of the factory Maserati team, was disqualified for receiving a push start after his first lap spin.

Ascari, who had taken his fourth consecutive victory, along with a fourth consecutive fastest lap, had now scored the maximum of 36 points for the season, as only a driver&#x27;s four best results counted. As a result, he clinched the world championship, making him the first driver to win the championship with two races left to go. The date was 3 August, the earliest anyone would claim the Championship until Jim Clark seized the crown on 1 August in 1965, also at the Nürburgring. Ascari&#x27;s teammates, Taruffi and Farina, remained in second and third, respectively, in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, while Swiss driver Fischer&#x27;s second podium of the season raised him up to fourth in the standings.

<text>The 1952 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 17 August 1952 at the Circuit Zandvoort. It was race 7 of 8 in the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. The 90-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from pole position. His teammates Giuseppe Farina and Luigi Villoresi finished in second and third places. Ascari overtook Fangio&#x27;s record for the most race wins, scoring his seventh at this race.

== Race report == 
Luigi Villoresi, absent from the World Championship since the final round of the 1951 season, returned to the Ferrari lineup for the Dutch Grand Prix, replacing Piero Taruffi, alongside regulars Nino Farina and Alberto Ascari, the latter of which had clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship title two weeks previously. Charles de Tornaco also drove a Ferrari at Zandvoort, on behalf of the Ecurie Francorchamps team. Gordini entered the same three drivers from the previous event, the French trio of Behra, Manzon and Trintignant, while Belgian driver Paul Frère drove an Ecurie Belge-entered Simca-Gordini. The HWM team partnered Britons Lance Macklin and Duncan Hamilton with the local driver Dries van der Lof. The only other Dutch driver on the grid was Jan Flinterman, who took part in a Maserati for Escuderia Bandeirantes alongside Chico Landi and Gino Bianco. The works Maserati team were once again absent from the grid, following an unsuccessful appearance in Germany. The field was completed by the Connaught of Ken Downing, Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s Cooper-Bristol, Ken Wharton&#x27;s Frazer-Nash and Stirling Moss in an ERA.

The Ferraris once again dominated qualifying, with Ascari taking his fourth pole position of the season, ahead of Farina in second. Mike Hawthorn shone in practice, gaining a front-row start for his little Cooper-Bristol, relegating Villoresi&#x27;s Ferrari to the second row of the grid. Trintignant&#x27;s Gordini completed row two, while his teammates Behra and Manzon were joined on the third row by Wharton in the sole Frazer-Nash.

Hawthorn fought valiantly with the Ferraris for five laps before they resumed their usual formation. Ascari led Farina and Villoresi home in another Ferrari procession, with Hawthorn gaining fourth place, two laps behind the Ferrari trio. This was Ascari&#x27;s fifth consecutive victory (along with a fifth consecutive fastest lap), and his seventh victory in total, breaking Fangio&#x27;s record for the most World Championship race wins. The Gordinis of Manzon and Trintignant finished a further lap behind Hawthorn, taking fifth and sixth place, respectively. Stirling Moss got up as high as seventh in the ERA before having to retire.

Farina&#x27;s podium finish took him to second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings, overtaking the absentee Taruffi. Swiss driver Rudi Fischer, also not present at the Dutch Grand Prix, remained in fourth, while Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s result took him to fifth in the standings, level on points with Fischer.

<text>In the Rain is the eighth studio album by the English band Sol Invictus, released in 1995 by the record label Tursa. On this recording, Sol Invictus wed trumpet, violin and cello to folk arrangements. Lyrically, the album focuses on the fragility of life and the certainty of death.

==Recording and production==
&quot;In the Rain&quot; was the first Sol Invictus album to fully incorporate classical instrumentation. It was the last on which the musicians David Mellor and Sarah Bradshaw participated.

The frontman Tony Wakeford has described it as his most personal album. According to the book &quot;Looking for Europe: Neofolk und Hintergründe&quot;, the song &quot;An English Garden&quot; appears to be inspired by the film &quot;The Innocents&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James. The album liner notes include drawings by Tor Lundvall.

==Reception==
John Bush of AllMusic described &quot;In the Rain&quot; as &quot;a good collection of pop songs&quot; but criticised Wakeford&#x27;s vocals for being &quot;occasionally erratic&quot;. The music scholar Isabella van Elferen analyzed the track &quot;An English Garden&quot; in 2013. She used its lyrics as an example of the nostalgia and sense of &quot;not-belonging&quot; present in goth music, and wrote that the instrumentation, song structure and chords evoke the &quot;idealised British home of Goth&quot;, which becomes &quot;musically disclosed as the locus of nothing less than the uncanny itself&quot;. The French music critic wrote in 2016 that the album significantly changed the genre of neofolk, because it added cello, violin, piano and trumpet to the acoustic guitar and vocals, creating a new formula based on &quot;slick production and the simple but effective beauty of the melodies&quot;. Cesare Buttaboni and Marco De Baptistis of &quot;&quot; call it &quot;undoubtedly Sol Invictus&#x27; masterpiece up to that point&quot;, highlighting the album&#x27;s relatively varied vocals, the absence of filler tracks and how the lyrics attribute spiritual value to everyday details, which creates a message that is pessimistic but open to hope.

<text>The 1952 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 7 September 1952 at Monza. It was the eighth and final round of the 1952 World Championship of Drivers, in which each Grand Prix was run to Formula Two rules rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. The 80-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from pole position. José Froilán González finished second for the Maserati team and Ascari&#x27;s teammate Luigi Villoresi came in third.

== Race report ==
Due to the dominance of the Ferrari team throughout 1952, the World Drivers&#x27; Championship had already been clinched a month prior to the season-ending Italian Grand Prix. Nevertheless, Ferrari entered five drivers for their home race, with their Dutch Grand Prix trio—World Champion Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina and Luigi Villoresi—being joined by Piero Taruffi and André Simon, both of whom had competed for the Scuderia at various points of the season. There were also a number of privateer Ferraris, including the Ecurie Espadon pairing of Fischer and Stuck, as well as Charles de Tornaco of Ecurie Francorchamps, Louis Rosier and Peter Whitehead. The works Maserati team appeared for the first and only time in the 1952 World Championship, running three cars for Felice Bonetto, Franco Rol and José Froilán González. Also running A6GCMs were the Escuderia Bandeirantes trio of Bianco, Cantoni and Landi, while Enrico Platé&#x27;s drivers—Toulo de Graffenried and debutant Alberto Crespo—ran the older 4CLT/48 equipped with the team&#x27;s own revised engines. Gordini retained their previous driver lineup of Behra, Manzon and Trintignant, while Johnny Claes drove a privateer Simca-Gordini at Monza. HWM entered a pair of cars for Peter Collins and Lance Macklin, with Australian Tony Gaze running a privateer HWM. The Connaught team, absent since the British Grand Prix, returned to the Championship with a three-car entry consisting of Stirling Moss (who had driven for ERA at the previous event), Dennis Poore and Kenneth McAlpine.

For this event, only 24 cars were allowed to take the start, meaning that 11 of the 35 drivers who had entered the race failed to qualify. These included all of the HWMs, three of the privateer Ferraris, and both of the Enrico Platé-entered Maseratis. Ascari took his third consecutive pole position (and his fifth of the season), and the front row was completed by his teammates Villoresi and Farina, and the Gordini of Trintignant. The Maserati of González started from the second row, alongside the remaining works Ferraris of Taruffi and Simon, and the Gordini of Robert Manzon. Row three consisted of Stirling Moss in the leading Connaught, Frenchman Élie Bayol in the sole OSCA, Behra in the third and final works Gordini, and Mike Hawthorn in his privateer Cooper-Bristol. The remaining works Maseratis of Bonetto and Rol were only able to make the fourth row of the grid, starting from 13th and 16th, respectively.

José Froilán González emerged in first place at the start of the race, ahead of Ascari in second. The Argentine remained in the lead for the first 36 laps of the race, until a slow pit stop allowed the Ferraris of Ascari and Villoresi to pass him for first and second, respectively. Ascari held the lead for the remainder of the race, and, in so doing, took his sixth consecutive World Championship race victory. González caught up with Villoresi and passed him to take second place in his only Championship race of the season. Villoresi completed the podium by taking his second consecutive third-place finish. Farina was not far behind in fourth place, while the second Maserati of Felice Bonetto took the final points position in fifth, finishing a lap down on the leaders. The remaining works Ferraris of Simon and Taruffi finished in sixth and seventh place, respectively.

As Taruffi finished outside the points, he was unable to overtake Nino Farina in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings. The Ferrari team monopolised the top three positions, with World Champion Alberto Ascari ahead of teammates Farina and Taruffi.

<text>The 1953 Argentine Grand Prix was race 1 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two regulations in 1952 and 1953. The race was held in Buenos Aires on 18 January 1953, at the Autódromo Gálvez (official name: Autódromo Juan y Óscar Gálvez, also known as the Autódromo 17 de Octubre) and was the first World Drivers&#x27; Championship race in South America.

==Race report==

The inaugural Argentine Grand Prix, held in mid-January, was attended by four of the major works teams: Maserati, Ferrari, Cooper, and Gordini. Former World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio, who had not competed in the Championship since clinching the 1951 title in Spain, raced for Maserati alongside fellow Argentines José Froilán González and Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, and Italian driver Felice Bonetto. Ferrari lined up with the familiar trio of reigning World Champion Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina, and Luigi Villoresi, as well as their new signing Mike Hawthorn, who had driven a privateer Cooper the previous year. The Cooper team entered the British pair of Alan Brown and John Barber alongside the local driver Adolfo Schwelm Cruz. Gordini retained their 1952 trio of Robert Manzon, Maurice Trintignant, and Jean Behra, who were joined by a pair of Argentines—Carlos Menditeguy and Pablo Birger—the latter of which drove a Simca-Gordini.

Ascari was once again the fastest qualifier, taking his fourth consecutive World Championship pole position. His teammates Villoresi and Farina lined up third and fourth, but the returning Fangio prevented a Ferrari front row lockout by qualifying second in his Maserati. González, in the second Maserati, started from row two alongside Hawthorn, making his first appearance for Ferrari, and the Gordini of Trintignant. The remaining Gordinis of Manzon, Menditeguy, and Behra made up the third row with Gálvez in his Maserati. Row four consisted of the Coopers of Brown and Schwelm Cruz, and Birger in the sole Simca-Gordini. At the back of the grid were the Maserati of Bonetto and Barber in the final Cooper.

Due to President Juan Perón&#x27;s decision to allow free access to the circuit, there were an excessive number of spectators and they lined the track as the race began. One of the spectators wandered onto the track, and, in order to avoid hitting him, Nino Farina was forced to swerve. Farina ultimately lost control of his car and crashed into the crowd on lap 31, killing 13 spectators. In the resulting mass panic, a boy ran in front of Brown&#x27;s Cooper and was killed.

Ascari, who started from pole, led the entirety of the race, taking his seventh consecutive World Championship race victory, and, in so doing, established an early lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Fangio was in second until a transmission issue forced him to retire from the race. Manzon initially inherited the position, but Villoresi ultimately took second place, a lap behind his teammate. Hawthorn had been running in third, although he was eventually overtaken by González, preventing a Ferrari 1-2-3. Hawthorn finished fourth, ahead of Gálvez, who took the final points in his first and only World Championship race.

==Entries==
: — Maurice Trintignant qualified and drove 50 laps of the race in the #28 Gordini. Harry Schell took over the car for the remainder of the race.

<text>The 37th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1953. The event was part of the 1953 AAA National Championship, and was race 2 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers. Bill Vukovich, after falling just short a year before, dominated the race, leading 195 of the 200 laps. Vukovich won the first of two consecutive &quot;500&quot; victories, finishing more than three minutes ahead of second place Art Cross.

With the temperature in the high 90s (°F), and the track temperature exceeding , this race is often known as the &quot;Hottest 500&quot;. Only twelve cars were running at the finish. Many starters needed relief drivers, and some relief drivers required their own relief drivers. Vukovich and Cross, however, both ran the full 500 miles solo. Owing to the excruciating conditions, driver Carl Scarborough dropped out of the race, and later died at the infield hospital due to heat prostration. Not only were drivers and crew members suffering from the intense heat, but spectators as well. According to one of the doctors at the infield hospital, the number of persons requiring treatment at the hospital was &quot;beyond comprehension&quot;. This included at least eleven members of the Purdue Band, who marched and performed during pre-race ceremonies.

==Time trials==
On Friday May 15, one day prior to the opening of time trials, sixteen-year race veteran Chet Miller died in a crash in turn one. Going into the race, Miller was the 1-lap (139.600 mph) and 4-lap (139.034 mph) track record holder (139.600 mph), a mark that he set in 1952. After completing a fast lap of over 138 mph, Miller went low going into turn one. The back end got loose, then the car turned to the right and drove head-on into the outside retaining wall. The car slid along the outside wall for about 100 yards, and came to rest in the south short chute. Miller, was found dead of a basal skull fracture and brain hemorrhage and likely was killed instantly.

===Saturday May 16===
The first day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 15, but was rained out. Pole qualifying was rescheduled for Sunday at 12 p.m.

===Sunday May 17===
Morning rain delayed the start of time trials until about 2:20 p.m. Only twelve drivers managed to take to the track, and seven completed a qualifying attempt. Manny Ayulo was the first driver in the field, completing his run at a speed of 136.384 mph. Bill Vukovich won the pole position with a four-lap average speed of 138.392 mph, which was not a new track record. Vukovich famously completed his qualifying run in the rain. On his third lap, his car slid sideways going into turn one due to increasing dampness, but he stayed with it. On his fourth and final lap, as Vukovich was coming out of turn four, the skies opened up and a downpour ensued. The speed on his last lap slipped to 137 mph, but he nevertheless took the checkered flag. The track was closed and Vukovich secured the pole position.

===Saturday May 23===
The third day of time trials opened with 26 spots still open in the starting grid. With as many as 66 cars in the paddock looking for a chance to qualify, the schedule for time trials was extended to 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. A very busy day saw 45 total qualifying attempts; 27 cars completed an attempt. The field was filled to 33 cars, and one car (Joe Barzda) was bumped.

Johnnie Parsons, the 1950 winner, was the fastest driver of the day. His speed of 137.667 mph wound up being the third-fastest overall in the field, but as a third day qualifier, he was forced to line up in 8th starting spot (middle of row 3). The threat of rain added to the urgency of the day. However, the rain held off throughout most of the afternoon. Two drivers (Marshall Teague and Eddie Johnson) exhausted all three of their allotted attempts. Teague slid sideways in turn two during his attempt, but would hold on to make the field. Johnson would later be bumped.

No incidents were reported during the day. Art Cross threw a rod during his first attempt. He took over the car of Jimmy Reece, and qualified 12th. Among those not yet in the field was Henry Banks.

===Sunday May 24===
Bump Day, the fourth and final day of time trials, was held on Sunday May 24. With the field already filled to 33 cars, the bumping process began right away. A total of six cars were bumped. Len Duncan was the first driver bumped for the day, after the successful run of Jimmy Bryan. Duncan later got in a backup car, but wrecked it in a practice run. Frank Armi spun out in turn two and also failed to make the race. Both Duncan and Armi would return to the make the race in 1954.

Bill Holland, the 1949 winner, returned to Indianapolis after being suspended by AAA for competing in &quot;outlaw&quot; races. Holland&#x27;s car from the previous Sunday was bumped, but he took over the John Finch machine. He put in a speed of 137.868 mph, and became the second-fastest car overall in the field. Johnnie Tolan got out on the track with five seconds left before the 7 o&#x27;clock gun. His speed of 134.852 mph, however, was too slow to make the field.

==Race summary==
===First half===
Race day dawned hot, with temperatures climbing into the 90s. The command to start engines was given at 10:54 a.m., and the field pulled away for the pace lap. At start, Bill Vukovich took the lead from the pole position, and led the field into turn one. Manny Ayulo and Tony Bettenhausen battled for second as Vukovich pulled out to a comfortable lead. On lap 4, Andy Linden crashed in turn three. Jerry Hoyt spun to the infield grass to avoid the wreck. Linden was out, but Hoyt was able to continue in the race. The yellow light stayed on for about one lap, and Linden was not injured.

Vukovich surrendered the lead during his first pit stop on lap 48. That put Fred Agabashian in the lead for one lap, followed by Jim Rathmann, then Sam Hanks for two laps. After the leaders cycled through their stops, Vukovich was back in the lead on lap 54. At the same time, Gene Hartley spun out in turn four bringing out the second yellow of the day. Hartley was taken to the infield hospital, but was released and would be able to serve as a relief driver later in the day.

The grueling conditions were starting to take a toll on the field. Several cars dropped out with mechanical problems before the halfway point. Jimmy Davies came into the pits without brakes, and brushed the inside wall to slow the car down. He would stay in the race to finish 10th, but several laps down. When Duke Nalon came in for his pit stop, his crew dumped a bucket of water over his head. On lap 70, Carl Scarborough came into the pits, feeling sick from the heat and fumes. Due to a fuel spill, a small fire broke out on the side of the car. The fire was quickly extinguished, and Scarborough climbed over the pit wall where he collapsed onto a chair. Bob Scott, who had already dropped out with an oil leak, took over behind the wheel. Scarborough was taken to the infield hospital where his temperature was recorded as . Physicians unsuccessfully performed open-heart massage, but he died of what was reported as heat prostration. According to speedway historian Donald Davidson, Scarborough may have inhaled carbon dioxide from the fire extinguishers, which may have contributed to, or been the actual cause of death.

With 80 laps completed, Bill Vukovich was still leading, with Art Cross second and Fred Agabashian third. Don Freeland lost a wheel in turn one on the leader&#x27;s lap 81, and he spun down to the infield grass. He was unhurt, but the car was finished. Johnnie Parsons dropped out with a blown engine on lap 86, and Duane Carter was out with ignition problems.

===Second half===
At the halfway point, Bill Vukovich led with Fred Agabashian in second and Sam Hanks in third. Agabashian came in for a pit stop on lap 104. Agabashian was overcome by the heat and the engine fumes, and had to be replaced in the cockpit by relief driver Paul Russo. Jim Rathmann did the same, handing his car over to Eddie Johnson on lap 113. Vukovich came in for his second pit stop on lap 112, followed by Hanks four laps later. Back out on the track, Vukovich had a 50-second lead over Hanks.

Pat Flaherty hit the wall in the northchute on the leaders&#x27; lap 118. The yellow light was turned on for 6 minutes and 50 seconds to clean up the oil and fluids that spilled on the track. The next driver to fall by the wayside was Tony Bettenhausen. After completing 115 laps, Bettenhausen came into the pits signaling for a relief driver. Chuck Stevenson took over the car as Bettenhausen passed out and collapsed to the ground from the heat. After a lengthy period of rest, Jim Rathmann got back in the race. Rathmann took over the car of Bill Holland, but it ultimately broke down with a magneto failure.

At the 150-lap mark (375 miles), Bill Vukovich had lapped the field. Manny Ayulo was running second, and Sam Hanks in third. Ayulo&#x27;s day ended after 184 laps with engine failure. Hanks came in on lap 151, and he was the next to need a relief driver. Duane Carter got behind the wheel, but the team lost considerable time as the crew had to repair a broken exhaust pipe before he could get the car back out. Marshall Teague came in on lap 169 needing assistance climbing out of the car. Cal Niday was preparing to take over behind the wheel, but in the meantime, the crew discovered an irreparable oil leak and the car was done for the day.

Bill Vukovich made his final pit stop on lap 171. Henry Banks was reportedly standing by in Vukovich&#x27;s pit, with his helmet on ready to drive relief. Vukovich, however, refused the help and insisted on driving the full 500 miles solo. He drank a cup of water, poured some water down the back of his shirt, and went back out on the track. After witnessing this, radio network reporter Luke Walton labeled Vukovich the &quot;ironman&quot; of the race. Walton described the day as the &quot;hottest day we&#x27;ve had in Hoosierland since Willkie accepted the nomination in Elwood back in 1940&quot;.

Vukovich cruised over the final 30 laps and won his first &quot;500&quot; by 3 minutes and 30 seconds (about 3 laps) over second place Art Cross. Duane Carter (driving the car of Sam Hanks) came home third, with Paul Russo (driving the car of Fred Agabashian) fourth. As Vukovich was headed to victory lane, the action on the track was still hot. Gene Hartley (driving Tony Bettenhausen&#x27;s car) crashed, as did Duke Nalon. Officials flagged the race after the first eight cars finished. Only four other cars were still running.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live flag-to-flag on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Instead of being produced by 1070 WIBC-AM, the network pooled together talent and technical staff from all five of the major radio stations in Indianapolis. The broadcast was anchored by Sid Collins, and featured on-air talent from WIBC, WFBM, WISH, WIRE, and WXLW.

The broadcast signed on at 10:45 a.m. local time, and carried live through the conclusion, until 3:45 p.m. local time. The broadcast was carried on 135 stations in at least 35 states across the country, and on Armed Forced Network to Europe and Asia. Towards the end of the race, chief announcer Sid Collins departed the booth in order to report from victory lane. Charlie Brockman, the color commentator and co-announcer, called the last few laps including the finish.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1953 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 9 on the 1953 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Race winner Bill Vukovich earned 9 points towards the World Championship (8 points for first place, and 1 point for the fastest lap). Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished seventh in the final season standings.

<text>John Douglas Coleman (23 November 1928 – 5 April 1973) was an Australian rules footballer who played for and coached the Essendon Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Coleman is widely regarded as one of the greatest-ever Australian rules footballers. In a relatively short playing career, Coleman has the second-highest goal average in the history of the VFL/AFL (with 5.48), kicking 537 goals in 98 matches; he is behind only Peter Hudson (with 5.64). As of 2023, they are the only VFL/AFL players to average more than five goals per game. He was also known for his high-flying spectacular marks, in some cases jumping cleanly over opponents. After a knee injury ended his playing career at age 25, he returned to coach Essendon to premiership success. Coleman died in 1973, at the age of 44, of sudden coronary atheroma.

In 1981, the VFL named the Coleman Medal in his honour, awarding it to the League&#x27;s leading goalkicker at the end of the home-and-away rounds. In 1996 he was one of 12 inaugural Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees bestowed &quot;Legend&quot; status. He is the only player amongst them to have played fewer than 100 games at senior level.

== Early life ==
Born at Port Fairy in the Western District of Victoria on 23 November 1928 to Albert Ernest Coleman (a manager) and his wife Ella Elizabeth (née Matthews), Coleman was the youngest of four siblings; his three older siblings were Lawna Ella, Thurla Margaret and Albert Edwin.

Coleman was introduced to football at Port Fairy Higher Elementary School. During the early war years, the family moved to Melbourne, where Coleman was enrolled at Ascot Vale West State School. He later attended Moonee Ponds Central School, where he became dux of the school. 

== Football career ==

=== Promising junior ===
At the age of 12, Coleman was already playing in a local under-18 Australian rules football team. Two years later, in 1943, Coleman&#x27;s mother took the children to live at Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula as her husband remained in the city to look after his business. Coleman then divided his time between Melbourne, where he was a student at University High School, and Hastings, playing on Saturdays for the local football team which competed in the Mornington Peninsula League.

 first invited Coleman to train at the club in 1946, but they considered him too young to be able to play senior football.

In the following two seasons, Coleman completed pre-season training with Essendon and played in practice matches. However, both times he was sent back to Hastings, where he kicked 296 goals in 37 games over two years, including 23 in one game against Sorrento in August 1948.

=== Instant sensation ===

The 1949 season was a make-or-break time for the budding forward. He again trained with Essendon, but he was frustrated by many of the senior players who ignored his leads. Coleman&#x27;s potential was noted by a number of other clubs, and Richmond made an attempt to sign him. However, Essendon finally selected him for the opening-round match against Hawthorn.

From his first match, when he not only kicked a to-this-day unbeaten record of 12 goals on debut but also a goal with his first kick, Coleman was the star player in the game, which was experiencing a boom in the immediate post-war years. His 12 goals in the first home-and-away match of a season also equalled the Essendon record set by Ted Freyer against Melbourne on 27 April 1935 

Standing 185 cm tall, with a pale complexion and slight build, the 20-year-old Coleman did not appear at all imposing. He looked listless as he stood in the goal square, often a metre behind the full-back, with his long-sleeved guernsey (number 10) rolled up to his elbows. Then, with explosive speed, Coleman would slip the guard of his opponent and sprint into open space on the lead or leap onto a pack of players to take a spectacular mark. This innate ability to make position and his prodigious leap immediately caught the public imagination. He needed only a few opportunities to significantly influence the outcome of a game.

Later, one of his teammates, ruckman Geoff Leek, recalled one of his 1949 marks:

He usually converted from most of his set shots by way of a long, flat punt kick. Notwithstanding this, however, he was also an excellent drop kick. Ted Rippon, Coleman&#x27;s former business associate and vice-president of the football club, recalled that Coleman had kicked 14 goals in a match in Perth against a Western Australian side, and six of those goals had been drop-kicked against the wind.

Coleman capped his brilliant debut year in storybook fashion: he booted his one hundredth goal in the dying moments of a record Grand Final win over Carlton. As of 2023, he remains the only player to kick one hundred goals in his first year.

=== Second premiership ===
The next year, 1950, was Coleman&#x27;s most prolific season, kicking 120 goals despite missing one match with the flu, and he was a major factor in Essendon&#x27;s premiership win over North Melbourne. Coleman&#x27;s feat of kicking more than 100 goals in consecutive seasons had only been matched by Collingwood&#x27;s Gordon Coventry, South Melbourne&#x27;s Bob Pratt, and Collingwood&#x27;s Ron Todd, all of whom achieved the feat much later in their careers when they were older, stronger, and more experienced.

North Melbourne back pocket Pat Kelly said he would never forget playing against Essendon in Round 17 [of 1950]. Alf Brown of &quot;The Herald&quot; wrote:

Late in the 1950 second semi-final, Essendon was trailing North Melbourne by three points with just 30 seconds remaining. In driving rain, North&#x27;s Jock McCorkell unexpectedly punched a ball that was already rolling out over the boundary line back into play just before it crossed the line. Coleman pounced on the ball, and passed it to Ron McEwin in the goal square. McEwin kicked the goal, and Essendon won by three points, 11.14 (80) to 11.11 (77). Essendon had lost only one match during the season to that point.

In an unexpectedly one-sided grand final (many had thought that North Melbourne could win the rematch), with a rain-lashed third quarter, North Melbourne &quot;went the knuckle&quot;, rather than playing football, and specifically targeted Essendon players Dick Reynolds, Ron McEwin, Bill Snell, Bert Harper, Ted Leehane and, of course, Coleman. Essendon eventually won 13.14 (92) to North Melbourne&#x27;s 7.12 (54) in front of a crowd of 87,601.

Opposition coaches and full-backs stopped at nothing to curb Coleman&#x27;s influence. In a one-on-one duel, close-checking, spoiling defenders fared best, but few could outrun him, and certainly no one could match him in the air. Often pitted against two, or even three opponents, Coleman&#x27;s equilibrium could be upset by needling, jostling and physical contact, which often happened behind the play. Coleman&#x27;s occasionally fiery temper ensured that he never backed away from a confrontation.

=== Controversial suspension ===

Despite specific instructions having been given to the umpires in relation to the protection of forwards from &quot;interference&quot; from opposing backmen, and in the absence of any sort of protection at all from the field umpires, these problems with Coleman&#x27;s response to the ever-increasing level of provocation, abuse, headlocks, hair-tugging, and thuggery came to a head quite sensationally when Coleman was reported in the last minutes of the second quarter of Essendon&#x27;s last match of the 1951 home-and-away season against Carlton at Princes Park. He was reported for striking Carlton&#x27;s journeyman back-pocket ruckman Harry Caspar; Caspar was also reported for striking Coleman.

Today, it is well established that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman&#x27;s neck; that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was at the other end of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar&#x27;s thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match, bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.

He was finally persuaded to take the field for the second half, and once on the field, he was so &quot;full of fire&quot; that, according to the recollection of ruckman Geoff Leek, at the time resting in the forward pocket, he took two of the most amazing marks that Leek had ever seen:

At the tribunal, Caspar&#x27;s case was heard first. Caspar was suspended for four weeks. Coleman&#x27;s defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation; the players&#x27; advocate Dan Minogue was thought to have made a good case for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he were a man at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.

Given that those who retaliated were thought to have been given more lenient penalties than those who instigated, and given that – because Carlton were not in the finals – Caspar&#x27;s penalty represented the first four home-and-home games in 1952, and given that Essendon were, indeed, playing in the 1951 finals, it was generally thought by those present at the tribunal that, if Coleman was to receive any penalty at all, he would be given no more than two weeks. The chairman announced a penalty of four weeks. Many years later, the tribunal&#x27;s chairman, Tom Hammond, agreed that whilst the tribunal had been technically correct in its penalty, given that &quot;there was no precedent&quot; for regarding retaliation as a lesser offence, he now believed that the tribunal had been wrong and that it easily could have created such a precedent.

Coleman broke down and wept with anger, disbelief and disappointment. As his friends and colleagues tried to assist Coleman from the tribunal&#x27;s building, the impact of the rush of the large waiting crowd hurled Coleman against a traffic signal-box. He struck his head and collapsed on the pavement. He was eventually assisted into one of his friend&#x27;s cars.

Eventually, the Bombers went on, without Coleman—and with Dick Reynolds coming out of retirement as 20th man—to lose the grand final by eleven points, and Essendon supporters to this day blame Coleman&#x27;s suspension for Essendon&#x27;s failure to win its third successive premiership.
=== A goalless afternoon ===
On Saturday, 28 June 1952, in round ten of the 1952 season, at a very muddy (and narrow) Brunswick Street Oval, Coleman played opposite the champion Fitzroy fullback Vic Chanter. In a tough, rugged match, Fitzroy 13.12 (90) defeated Essendon 5.8 (38). Coleman, who would finish the 1952 season with 103 goals, did not score a goal in the match; this was the first (and only) time that Coleman was held goalless in his entire 98-game career. He had less than half a dozen kicks for the entire match—despite being moved to centre half-forward for a while during the second quarter—and was only able to score two behinds, one of which was effected with the last scoring kick of the match.

=== Career-ending injury ===
After six successive years in the finals, Essendon dropped down the ladder as an era ended. Coleman continued to be the best forward in the game, winning the VFL goalkicking by scoring 103 goals in 1952 and 97 in 1953. In the seventh game of the 1954 season, he kicked his best-ever tally of 14 goals against Fitzroy. But at Windy Hill a week later, Coleman fell heavily and dislocated his knee in what proved to be his last game. His attempts to return drew many headlines over the next two years, but, despite surgery, he was forced to concede defeat in the lead-up to the 1956 season. There were revelations in early 1958 that Coleman&#x27;s knee was sufficiently repaired to play on and his true reasons for not playing were unrelated to his knee.

Coleman kicked 537 goals in just 98 appearances, at an average of 5.48 goals per game. At the time of his retirement, it was the highest goals-per-game average by any player, exceeding the next-best total of Bob Pratt (4.31 goals per game) by more than a goal. Coleman&#x27;s feats were even more impressive by virtue of the fact that he achieved them at a time when the rules of the game were less favourable to full-forwards: between 1925 and 1939, a free kick was always awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which resulted in teams of the era adopting a direct game plan which favoured strong full-forwards, thus it was an era which produced many of the league&#x27;s heaviest goalscorers, including Pratt, Gordon Coventry, Bill Mohr and Ron Todd. However, Coleman played after the boundary throw-in had been re-introduced, resulting in more play along the wings and less prominence from full-forwards. As of 2023, Coleman&#x27;s VFL/AFL record average has been surpassed by only Peter Hudson (5.64 goals per game).

== After football ==
Coleman was a capable businessman who understood the commercial potential of his fame. Football had interrupted his commerce studies at Melbourne University in 1949, but the game helped him to launch a career managing pubs. Essendon vice president Ted Rippon, also an Essendon footballer before the Second World War, made him the manager of the Auburn Hotel, and their association continued when Coleman became licensee of the Essendon Hotel. Subsequently, he went into business on his own, running the West Brunswick Hotel.

He also developed media interests, writing for the &quot;Herald&quot; newspaper from 1954 and appearing as a commentator on television after its introduction in 1956.

==Coaching career==
Coleman&#x27;s business and family life took an unexpected turn in 1961, when Essendon – who, in recent times, were being increasingly referred to as &quot;the Gliders&quot;, rather than &quot;the Bombers&quot;, because of their poor performances at the business end of the season – considered replacing Dick Reynolds as coach (he had been at Essendon for 27 years, 21 as coach), and declared the coaching position open. Essendon received three applications for the coaching position: 1960 coach Dick Reynolds, 1960 team captain Jack Clarke, and John Coleman (then 32 and out of football for 6 years), who had been persuaded to apply despite having no coaching experience. Coleman was not the committee&#x27;s unanimous choice, with both Reynolds and Clarke receiving some support, but he received an almost two-to-one majority of the final vote.

Coleman was appointed coach on a day of mixed emotion; his father had died the day before. Coleman&#x27;s brief was to inject more vigour into the side and get them to play as Coleman had done. He proved to be a clever tactician, eschewing the histrionics of a &quot;hot-gospelling&quot; style, instead concentrating his efforts on quietly harnessing the individual talents of his players, expressing the view that team spirit was, to him, just as important as physical fitness for eventual team success. Coleman was unable to supervise his first training session until 6 April 1961 (the first home-and-away match was 15 April 1961), because he had come down with hepatitis on his return to Australia, following a two-month holiday with his wife Monica in India and Sri Lanka.

After a disappointing first season when the team seemed to have trouble adjusting to his style, Coleman surprised many by leading the Bombers to the premiership in 1962. The team performed brilliantly, losing only two games for the season and crushing Carlton in the grand final. During his playing days, Coleman had developed a special loathing for umpires, and they were often the target of his venomous tongue as a coach.

Essendon suffered a premiership hangover and finished fifth in the 1963 season. They were subsequently eliminated in the first semi-final of the 1964 finals series. Another flag followed in 1965 when Essendon achieved the rare feat of winning from fourth place. With two premierships in the bag as a coach, Coleman could rest assured that his reputation was secure.

By now, though, his health had begun to cause him some concern. Coleman&#x27;s knee injury prevented him from actively participating in training, and he suffered badly from thrombosis. However, he reluctantly agreed to return for the 1967 season. The Bombers missed the finals, and Coleman voluntarily handed the coaching job over to Clarke.

== Personal life ==
Coleman married his Sri Lankan wife, Reine Monica Fernando, in March 1955. They had two daughters, Anne-Marie and Jennifer.

Following his coaching career, Coleman moved to the Mornington Peninsula, buying a rural property at Arthurs Seat and running the Dromana Hotel.

== Death ==
In the early hours of 5 April 1973, Coleman died suddenly of coronary atheroma. in his hotel at Dromana. The public was stunned and saddened. He was just 44 years old.

Two days later, the opening round of the VFL season included a match held at Windy Hill between Essendon and Richmond, which in effect became a John Coleman memorial. Richmond defeated Essendon by 2 points that day, with the decisive last goal of the game kicked by Richmond&#x27;s Kevin Sheedy, who would go on to be Essendon&#x27;s next premiership-winning coach (in 1984) after Coleman. Following a large funeral conducted at St Thomas&#x27; Church of England in Moonee Ponds (the church in which he had married) by Archdeacon Randal Hugh Deasey the next Monday, Coleman was cremated. Some 400 people, including many of Melbourne&#x27;s sporting community, packed into the church, and another 600 stood outside the church listening to the service broadcast over loudspeakers.

The pallbearers included Coleman&#x27;s brother Albert, his former business associate Ted Rippon, and the former Essendon full-forward Ted Fordham. The mourners included former Lord mayor Sir Maurice Nathan and Ralph Lane from the VFL, and Essendon footballers John Birt, Russell Blew, Jack Clarke, Ken Fraser, Geoff Leek, Greg Sewell, David Shaw, John Somerville, and John Williams.

His estate was sworn for probate at $280,279.82, which is the equivalent of roughly $2.4 million (2015).

<text>The 1953 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 7 June 1953 at the Circuit Zandvoort. It was race 3 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. The 90-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from pole position. His teammate Nino Farina finished second and Maserati drivers José Froilán González and Felice Bonetto came in third

==Race report==

The Dutch Grand Prix, which had been held in August the previous year, moved to an earlier June calendar slot in 1953. Ferrari retained the same four drivers who had competed at Buenos Aires—Alberto Ascari, Luigi Villoresi, Nino Farina and Mike Hawthorn—while there was also a privateer Ferrari for Frenchman Louis Rosier. The Scuderia&#x27;s most significant competition came from the Maserati team, who came to Zandvoort with three of their four drivers from the Argentine Grand Prix: Juan Manuel Fangio, José Froilán González and Felice Bonetto. Swiss driver Toulo de Graffenried raced in a privateer Maserati for Enrico Platé&#x27;s team. Gordini also entered three cars for this event, with Maurice Trintignant and Harry Schell (who had shared Trintignant&#x27;s car at Buenos Aires) being retained from their lineup for Argentina. Roberto Mieres made his Grand Prix debut in the team&#x27;s third car. The Connaught works team retained Kenneth McAlpine and Stirling Moss from their lineup for the previous European race, the Italian Grand Prix, while fellow British driver Roy Salvadori also drove for the team, and Johnny Claes entered a privateer Connaught. HWM also stuck with the drivers who had competed for them in Monza—Peter Collins and Lance Macklin—while Ken Wharton completed the field in his privateer Cooper-Bristol.

Ascari took his fifth consecutive pole position (excluding the Indy 500, in which none of the European teams competed), and he was joined on the front row by Fangio in his Maserati and the second Ferrari of Farina. Villoresi in the third Ferrari started from the second row, alongside the Maserati of González, while the third row consisted of Hawthorn in the remaining works Ferrari and a pair of privateers—de Graffenried in a Maserati and Rosier in his Ferrari. The final works Maserati of Bonetto could only manage to qualify on the fifth row of the grid, starting from thirteenth.

The race was held in very difficult conditions – the track was made slippery by loose grit. The Ferraris had better road holding and once again Alberto Ascari led from start to finish, while the main competition for second place was between his teammates Farina and Villoresi. Farina ultimately finished second, while Villoresi, who took the point for fastest lap, was forced to retire with a throttle issue. A problem with his suspension forced González to retire. Three laps later, however, he took over his teammate Felice Bonetto&#x27;s car and ran out the winner of an exciting duel with Mike Hawthorn, once again depriving Ferrari of a 1-2-3. González and Bonetto shared the four points for third place. Fangio retired with a broken back axle, having been in fourth behind the leading Ferrari trio at the time. Toulo de Graffenried took the final points position in fifth, his first points since the 1951 Swiss Grand Prix.

Ascari&#x27;s eight consecutive World Championship race victory (ignoring the Indianapolis 500) gave him a clear lead in the points standings. He was eight points clear of Bill Vukovich, the winner at Indianapolis, while his nearest genuine rivals for the Drivers&#x27; Championship were his teammates Villoresi and Farina, who were in third and fourth, respectively. González and Hawthorn were level on points with Farina, eleven points adrift of Ascari.

==Entries==
: — Felice Bonetto qualified and drove 25 laps of the race in the #16 Maserati. José Froilán González, whose own car had already retired, took over the car for the remainder of the race.
: — Jean Behra was initially due to drive the #22 Gordini, but, due to injuries suffered at the non-championship Pau Grand Prix, he was unable to participate, and so was replaced by Roberto Mieres.
: — Fred Wacker neither set a qualifying time nor started the race, as his engine was used by Harry Schell.

<text>The 1953 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 21 June 1953 at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 4 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. The 36-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from second position. His teammate Luigi Villoresi finished second and Maserati driver Onofre Marimón came in third.

==Race report==
Two weeks after the previous World Championship race, the Dutch Grand Prix, the teams headed to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. Ferrari were once again unchanged from the previous race, retaining the lineup of Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina, Luigi Villoresi and Mike Hawthorn, while there were also privateer Ferraris for Louis Rosier and the Ecurie Francorchamps duo of Jacques Swaters and Charles de Tornaco. The Maserati factory team added Johnny Claes and a third Argentine, Onofre Marimón, to their lineup of Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán González, while Felice Bonetto missed this race. Toulo de Graffenried drove the only privateer Maserati at Spa. Jean Behra, whose injuries prevented his participation at Zandvoort, returned for Gordini alongside Maurice Trintignant, and the American pairing of Harry Schell and Fred Wacker, while HWM called on the services of Paul Frère (as they had done the previous year) in their third car in addition to regulars Peter Collins and Lance Macklin. The field was completed by several privateers—Berger in a Simca-Gordini, Legat in a Veritas and Pilette in a Connaught.

A record crowd of over 100,000 spectators crammed into the forest track to watch this dramatic race. The Maseratis were definitely capable of matching the Ferraris for sheer speed – Juan Manuel Fangio put in a record-shattering practice lap of 117 mph, breaking Ascari&#x27;s run of five consecutive pole positions (excluding the Indianapolis 500). The defending World Champion had to settle for second place on the grid this time. The Maserati of González completed the front row, while row two consisted of the Ferraris of Farina and Villoresi. On the third row were Marimón in a Maserati, the remaining works Ferrari of Hawthorn, and Trintignant in the leading Gordini. Toulo de Graffenried, in his own Maserati, out-qualified the fourth works Maserati of Johnny Claes, with both starting from row four, while the remaining Gordinis were split between the fifth and sixth rows of the grid.

At the flag, Fangio waved González past and stunned everyone with another blitzkrieg lap of 110 mph from a standing start. After 11 laps, González had pulled out a full minute&#x27;s lead, but it had taken its toll on his engine which expired, leaving Fangio half a minute clear. On lap 13, it was the other Argentine&#x27;s turn to fall prey to engine troubles and so Ascari inherited the lead, initially ahead of Farina, before his race was ended by engine problems, handing second place to Hawthorn, while Marimón and Villoresi were third and fourth, respectively. Engine problems for Marimón allowed Villoresi to move up to third on lap 28, and a fuel leak for Hawthorn meant that Villoresi inherited second place on the following lap. Shortly after his own car had retired, Fangio took over Claes&#x27;s, and made something of a charge through the field: before Fangio retired on lap 14, Claes had been in ninth; by lap 30, Fangio had taken the car to third, behind only Ascari and Villoresi, who took another 1–2 victory. However, Fangio crashed heavily on the final lap of the race, giving his teammate Onofre Marimón his first podium position in the process. The remaining points were taken by the privateer Maserati of de Graffenried and the Gordini of Trintignant, while Hawthorn, in sixth place, just missed out.

Alberto Ascari, who had taken his ninth consecutive World Championship victory (ignoring the Indy 500), already had a large lead in the points standings. He was twelve points ahead of his teammate Villoresi, while Bill Vukovich, who won at Indianapolis, was third. González, who took the fastest lap point for this race, now had seven points, putting him eighteen points behind Ascari, and the remaining Ferraris of Farina and Hawthorn only had six points each.

==Entries==
: — Johnny Claes qualified and drove 14 laps of the race in the #6 Maserati. Juan Manuel Fangio, whose own car had already retired, took over the car for the remainder of the race.

<text>The 1953 French Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 5 July 1953 at Reims. It was race 5 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used.

It is popularly known as The Race of the Century because of the sixty lap battle between Briton Mike Hawthorn and Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio. Hawthorn won the duel after they reportedly swapped the lead at virtually every corner on the Reims circuit. In addition, after 500 km of racing, the four lead cars were less than 5 seconds apart.

== Background ==
For 1953, the Reims-Gueux circuit&#x27;s layout changed. The new, faster and slightly longer circuit bypassed the town of Gueux and as a result, the circuit was now called just &quot;Reims&quot;.

Coming into the French Grand Prix, Ferrari driver, and 1952 World Champion Alberto Ascari had a large lead in the championship, having won the first three races of the season (not including the Indianapolis 500 in which none of the Grand Prix contenders took part). Meanwhile, early favourite, 1951 World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio, driving for Maserati, had yet to even finish a World Championship qualifying event in 1953.

Unlike in 1952, in 1953 Maserati and Ferrari were quite evenly matched. The Maseratis had slightly more power, and hence straight-line speed, but the Ferraris had slightly better brakes, road holding, and low-end acceleration. Both works teams sent four drivers. For Ferrari there was Ascari, Luigi Villoresi, Nino Farina and Mike Hawthorn. Maserati had Fangio, José Froilán González, Onofre Marimón and Felice Bonetto. Both Ferrari and Maserati were also represented by a single private entry each, Louis Rosier driving a Ferrari and Toulo de Graffenried a Maserati.

All of the other entries had little chance of winning, as they had significantly less power than the Ferraris and Maseratis, as well as generally worse road holding. They consisted of two privately entered OSCAs (one to be driven by Louis Chiron in his last French Grand Prix start), four works Gordinis and three of each of Connaught, HWM and Cooper. The works Gordinis were poorly prepared, the team instead focusing on the 12 hour race which ran from midnight to midday on the same day as the Grand Prix. Two of the Connaughts were works entries, and were notable as the first fuel injected cars to start the French Grand Prix.

== Entries ==
== Practice and qualifying == 
There was very little activity in the earlier practice sessions, with the Ferrari team only arriving just in time for the final session. González was the early pacesetter for Maserati, but was eventually outdone by both Villoresi and Ascari for Ferrari. González would again set the fastest time of 2:41.5, but in Bonetto&#x27;s car, but Ascari would finally take pole position with a time of 2:41.2 late in the session. The front row of the 3-2-3 grid was therefore Ascari, Bonetto and Villoresi, with Fangio and González sharing row two.

The fastest six cars were separated by just 1.3 seconds, with the Ferraris and Maseratis clearly quite evenly matched. The first non-Ferrari or Maserati was the Connaught of Prince Bira with 2:53.2, 12 seconds slower than Ascari and around 2 seconds slower than Rosier in the slowest Ferrari.

=== Qualifying classification ===

;Notes
* – González set the second placed time of 2:41.5, however he was driving Bonetto&#x27;s car. Thus Bonetto started from second place, while González started in fifth with his fastest time in his own car of 2:42.4

== Pre-race controversy ==
The Grand Prix was preceded by the 12 hour sportscar race which ran from midnight to midday. During that race, the leading Ferrari, driven by Umberto Maglioli and Piero Carini, was disqualified, ostensibly for receiving a push start, and for switching off sidelights before the appointed time. Many, including Ferrari team manager Ugolini, felt this quite unfair, since the push-start had been to get clear of spilt petrol in the pitlane, and nearly every other car in the race had already switched off their sidelights by the time Maglioli did the same. Many in the crowd also disagreed with the disqualification, with the crowd booing and throwing rubbish at head officials Charles Faroux and Toto Roche.

As a result, Ferrari threatened to withdraw their cars from the Grand Prix, which would have surely handed Maserati an easy win. However, after several phone calls between Reims and Modena, the Ferraris were eventually allowed to start in the Grand Prix.

== Race ==
For the race, González decided to start with half a tank of fuel and make a pitstop in the race, while all of the other main contenders started with full tanks hoping to last the whole distance. This of course meant that González would need to build a large enough gap to make his pitstop.

At the start, from the front row Bonetto and Ascari both made good starts, while Villoresi was slow away, leaving a gap for González to quickly move into the lead with his much lighter car. At the end of the first lap González had built a 2.8 second gap over the other Italian cars, the order being Ascari, Villoresi, Bonetto, Fangio, Hawthorn, Farina and Marimón, with the gap from second to eighth just 2.2 seconds. Further back was the first of the non-Italian cars, with Bira just ahead of the Gordini of Maurice Trintignant, who had started from the back having not set a lap in practice.

On the second lap, González continued to pull away from the main pack, now led by the Ferraris of Ascari, Villoresi and Hawthorn, all disputing second place, with Farina close behind. They were followed by the Maseratis of Fangio and Marimón, with Bonetto dropping to ninth after a spin, behind Trintignant, Bira and de Graffenried. Apart from the three Ferraris contesting second place, the order near the front remained the same for the next 20 laps or so, at which point González ceased increasing his lead, making it unlikely he would be able to hold it when he made his stop.

On lap 23, Fangio overtook Farina, who responded by setting the then fastest lap of the race and retaking the position. On the following lap Fangio overtook Farina again, setting the fastest lap of the race in the process. This increase in pace of Fangio and Farina had now placed them in the middle of the three Ferraris, Fangio now in third place. Some shuffling of the pack took place by the time González made his pitstop on lap 29, with Fangio now leading it ahead of Hawthorn, with Villoresi dropping back to Marimón. González&#x27;s pitstop took just 27 seconds, but this allowed Fangio into the lead, with González dropping all the way down to sixth, ahead of Villoresi but behind Marimón who had just passed him.

At half distance, Fangio lead Hawthorn and Ascari, the top three separated by less than a second, followed at small intervals by Farina, Marimón, then González and Villoresi just a second apart, around 20 seconds behind Fangio. Bonetto was over a minute and 20 seconds behind Fangio, and no other drivers were still on the lead lap.

Over the next few laps, Fangio and Hawthorn would swap the lead several times, sometimes more than once a lap, pulling slowly away from Ascari who was locked in a close battle with Farina, González and Marimón. Villoresi, meanwhile, fell back, but not enough to be challenged for seventh place. González continued to push, catching and overtaking Farina then Ascari on lap 37. This spurred Ascari on, and he and González duelled for third place over the following 20 laps. Both the duels, for first place and for third place, would last until very near the end of the race, with the drivers separated by not more than a carlength at any stage.

With two laps to go, Fangio and Hawthorn crossed the finish line side by side, followed less than a second later by González and Ascari, also side by side. Hawthorn led into the last lap, with González very close now, but Ascari well off the pace having eased off. Coming into the final straight González was able to overlap slightly on Fangio, but Hawthorn lead the pair, winning the race by just one second from Fangio, with González just 0.4 seconds behind in third place.

<text>The 1953 German Grand Prix was a Formula Two motor racing event held on 2 August 1953 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. It was race 7 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. This race had the highest number of cars on the grid of any World Drivers&#x27; Championship race, with 34 starters.

This race was won by Nino Farina in a Ferrari, just over 1 minute ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio. This was Farina&#x27;s last victory in Formula One.

Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari clinched his second consecutive World Drivers&#x27; Championship as neither Mike Hawthorn nor Juan Manuel Fangio won the race and now couldn&#x27;t beat his points total with two races left.

Four East German drivers partook in this race; these four drivers were the only ever drivers to race under an East German licence. This race was the last time any driver competed under an East German licence: Theo Fitzau, Ernst Klodwig and Rudolf Krause would never race in Formula One again, while Edgar Barth would race again under a West German licence.

During his tour of Europe that saw Japan&#x27;s 19-year old Crown Prince Akihito visit the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, he also attended the German Grand Prix.

<text>The 1953 Swiss Grand Prix was a Formula Two race held on 23 August 1953 at Bremgarten Circuit. It was race 8 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. World Champion Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari won the race, the last race win and finish of his career.

The race marked the brief return of Grand Prix-era legend Hermann Lang. He was given a chance to participate in Formula 1 racing driving for Officine Alfieri Maserati after one of their team drivers was injured. He raced in two World Drivers&#x27; Championship events overall—one in 1953 and one in 1954—and his result here, a fifth-place finish, was his best result.

It was the ninth and final race in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. This made it the last World Championship race to run under the Formula Two regulations. The 80-lap race was won by Maserati driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from second position. Nino Farina finished second for the Ferrari team and his teammate Luigi Villoresi came in third.

== Race report ==
The initial part of the race was a four-way battle between Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Onofre Marimón. With five drivers running together on the last lap, the race saw a spectacular finish with Ascari and Farina ahead of Fangio approaching the last corner. Ascari made a mistake and spun. To avoid him, Farina pulled to the grass but recovered later. Fangio pounced on this window of opportunity and took a famous win. Ascari claimed the World Championship for Drivers&#x27; for the second, and final, time.

<text>Spenard is a neighborhood in the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska, United States and was historically a separate city from Anchorage. The road that bears its name, Spenard Road, begins at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport at its southern end, and continues north toward downtown before ending at Westchester Lagoon, where it turns and becomes part of I Street.

==History==

Before unification of the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975, Spenard was an unincorporated suburban community of Anchorage. It is arguably older than Anchorage itself, although records are not clear. Anchorage was founded on Ship Creek during construction of the Alaska Railroad. Spenard began as a lumber camp. The road from the lumber camp to the tent city on Ship Creek was subsequently named &quot;Spenard Road&quot; for Joe Spenard, an owner of the lumber camp. Joe Spenard built a dance hall/resort on the shores of Spenard Lake, which burned down after a brief period of great success.
For years, Spenard contained one of many &quot;red light districts&quot; in the region (other red light districts were found in downtown Anchorage on Fourth Avenue, in Fairview, and in the nearby neighborhood of Mountain View). During construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the City of Anchorage successfully cleaned up Fourth Avenue by literally bulldozing dozens of buildings. However, the proximity of Spenard to Anchorage International Airport resulted in unprecedented growth of bars, nightclubs, prostitution outlets, gambling clubs, and other disreputable businesses, which catered to pipeline workers laden with money after long stints in isolated construction camps. Today, Spenard still features a large number of bars and a somewhat higher rate of drunken crime than the rest of Anchorage, despite extensive efforts during the post-Pipeline era to &quot;clean up&quot; the community.

==Transportation==

There is much redevelopment (in the form of mixed-use, transit-oriented development) planned for the Spenard Road corridor, especially in the vicinity of 36th Avenue &amp; Spenard Road. In order to support this development, the neighborhood was placed on the People Mover&#x27;s &quot;frequent network&quot;, with the #40 bus operating every 15 minutes down Spenard Road on weekdays (weekend service operates every 30 minutes). There is also the #65 (once per hour), which takes neighborhood residents to/from the Dimond Center Mall via Jewel Lake Road.

== Race summary ==
Bill Vukovich had to work much harder in this race due to his car was now 2 years old and the team had trouble getting it up to speed leading to a 19th place starting spot inside of row 7 for the race. Vukovich did not see the lead until lap 61 when he led 1 lap. He then after losing positions during pitstops worked his way forward, seeing the lead again on lap 92 leading for the next 38 laps until falling back due to another round of pitstops. Then Vukovich took the lead for good on 150 to win his second consecutive 500, setting a record (at the time) 130.840 mph average race speed. The record would stand until the 1957 Indianapolis 500. Vukovich died the following year attempting to win his third consecutive Indy 500.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live flag-to-flag on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. It was the second time the race was carried in its entirety. The broadcast was anchored by Sid Collins, his third as chief announcer, and seventh year overall with the crew. Charlie Brockman served as booth analyst and statistician, and also reported from victory lane. For the first time ever, a female reporter was part of the radio crew. Paula Carr of WIRE served as a roving reporter, interviewing celebrities and other special guests.

Of note, the network expanded its coverage to include four qualifying wrap-up shows during time trials weekends.

The network expanded to include four qualifying wrap-up shows, and the number of affiliate stations increased to 210. All five major radio stations in Indianapolis carried the broadcast. The 1954 broadcast is notable in that it featured for the first time the famous phrase &quot;Stay tuned for the Greatest Spectacle in Racing.&quot; Due to the increased number of affiliates at the time, the network needed a scripted &quot;out-cue&quot; to alert producers when to manually insert local commercials. A young WIBC marketing staff member named Alice Greene (née Bunger) is credited with inventing the phrase, and chief announcer Sid Collins coined it on-air. It has been used ever since, with all of the chief announcers proudly reciting it during their respective tenures.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1954 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 9 on the 1954 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Race winner Bill Vukovich earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished sixth in the final season standings.

<text>The 1954 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 20 June 1954. It was race 3 of 9 in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. The 36-lap race was won by Maserati driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from pole position. Maurice Trintignant finished second for the Ferrari team with Fangio&#x27;s teammate Stirling Moss in third.

== Background ==

The opening race of the 1954 Formula One season was held in Argentina in January and won by Juan Manuel Fangio driving a Maserati. The second race that counted towards the year&#x27;s World Championship of Drivers, the 1954 Indianapolis 500, was, as in the years before, not attended by the European drivers (and won for the second time by Bill Vukovich). After the cancellation of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, the Belgian Grand Prix was the season&#x27;s first championship race on European soil, held five months after the season opener.

While most of the other drivers had competed in the various non-championship races, it was the first appearance of the season in Europe for Fangio, the championship leader. Fangio had signed with the Mercedes team for the season, but since their new car was not finished in time for the Francorchamps race, he competed in the Maserati 250F as he did at his home Grand Prix. Alongside him in the Maserati team were compatriot Onofre Marimón and Italian Sergio Mantovani, while Stirling Moss, Prince Bira and Roberto Mieres entered Maseratis for private teams.

After recovering from an accident at the Mille Miglia, 1950 World Champion Giuseppe Farina returned to the field in his Ferrari 553. The team was completed by José Froilán González, and in last year&#x27;s cars Maurice Trintignant and Mike Hawthorn. Jacques Swaters entered another Ferrari for his home Grand Prix.

The field was completed by the Gordini team with their drivers Jean Behra, Paul Frère and André Pilette. 
Although the newly formed Lancia team did make an entry for the Belgian Grand Prix, they withdrew, resulting in reigning World Champion Alberto Ascari missing another race of the season. Therefore, the field at Spa-Francorchamps only consisted of 14 drivers.

== Qualifying ==

On the first day of practise only the Ferraris were making an appearance. The battle for Pole Position became interesting, when Juan Manuel Fangio showed up on the second day. In his Maserati he managed to pulverize his own track record (set in 1951 in the Alfa Romeo 159) and qualified fastest with a time of 4:22.1. Behind him on second place was González who was very pleased with the improved handling of his Ferrari. Over two seconds behind him was Farina who wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all with the car&#x27;s set-up.

== Race ==

On 20 June 1954 the 14 cars lined up for the Belgian Grand Prix. Behind them a 15th car, the Maserati of Emmanuel de Graffenried was ready for the start to film authentic race footage for the upcoming movie &quot;The Racers&quot; starring Kirk Douglas. The start saw González take the lead in front of Farina while Fangio dropped back. During the first round the Maserati of Mieres caught on fire, but the driver was able to jump out of the moving car, getting away with only minor burns. Meanwhile, González&#x27; lead was only short lived; he had to retire after lap 1 with engine failure (as well as Swaters and two laps later Marimón). Farina led Hawthorn and Fangio, who managed to pull in front on lap 3.
At lap 10 Fangio lost the lead due to a broken visor strap that forced him into the pit. However, he quickly recovered and retook the lead. Farina had to retire with engine failure on lap 14, which left Fangio quite unchallenged with Hawthorn over a minute behind in second.

Hawthorn, who had not quite recovered from an accident at Syracuse, was slowing down during the following laps and therefore the Ferrari Team flagged him into the pits and had the car taken over by González, after a collapsed Hawthorn had to be lifted out of his car. Trintignant was therefore in second place. González soon discovered the reason for Hawthorn passing out: a broken exhaust pipe was allowing fumes in the cockpit, so the Argentinian pulled into the pits to have it fixed, losing a whole lap in the process.

Meanwhile, Fangio was sitting in a comfortable lead and rode to his second victory of the season, as well as recording the fastest lap of the race. Only seven cars were able to finish. The retirements had put Trintignant in second and Moss (who scored his first podium in a World Championship race) in his privately entered Maserati in third. After his long pit stop González managed to recover and finished fourth in front of Pilette, Bira and Mantovani. For Pilette it was his first and only finish in the points of his career.

<text>The 1954 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 4 July 1954. It was race 4 of 9 in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. The 61-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from pole position. His teammate Karl Kling finished second and Ferrari driver Robert Manzon came in third.

== Race report ==

The long-awaited Mercedes W196 with its straight-8 fuel-injection engine made its debut with Juan Manuel Fangio transferring from Maserati to join an otherwise all-German line-up of Hans Herrmann, Karl Kling and pre-war driver Hermann Lang. It was a dominant return with Fangio recording a practice lap of 124.31 mph. He and Kling led away and continued to race side by side around the Rheims track. The Ferrari drivers simply couldn&#x27;t cope with the pace. José Froilán González retired after 12 laps and Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s car blew up spectacularly. Former Ferrari double World Champion (1952 and 1953) Alberto Ascari drove a Maserati, as the Lancia D50 was not yet ready for racing, and lasted only 1 lap after starting on the outside of the front row. Herrmann set fastest lap before retiring, but Fangio and Kling continued their duel until the last lap when team orders were put in force and Fangio led Kling over the line by a mere 0.1 seconds-half a car length. Only six cars finished the gruelling race.

<text>The 1954 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 17 July 1954. It was race 5 of 9 in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. The 90-lap race was won by Ferrari driver José Froilán González after he started from second position. His teammate Mike Hawthorn finished second and Maserati driver Onofre Marimón came in third.

== Race report ==
A huge crowd turned out at Silverstone to see if Mercedes could repeat their Reims rout. In the end, just two silver cars arrived (for Fangio and Kling). In contrast, Maserati had nine cars, whilst Ferrari had three for the experienced trio of Hawthorn, Gonzalez and Trintignant. Fangio set Silverstone&#x27;s fastest ever lap, breaking the 100 mph barrier with a lap of 100.35 mph. It was Gonzalez who led away and held the lead until the flag. Behind him, Fangio passed Hawthorn for second but after colliding several times with oil drums in a difficult handling car, he dropped to fourth. Moss took over the position but retired with rear axle problems, leaving Hawthorn to follow home for a Ferrari 1–2 and young Onofre Marimón to take his second (and last) podium place.

<text>The 1954 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 1 August 1954. It was race 6 of 9 in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. It was the 17th German Grand Prix since the race was first held in 1926 and the 16th to be held at the Nürburgring complex of circuits. The race was won by 1951 world champion, Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio driving a Mercedes-Benz W196. Ferrari 625 drivers Mike Hawthorn (in a shared drive with José Froilán González) and Maurice Trintignant finished second and third for Scuderia Ferrari.

== Race report ==
The race was lengthened from 18 to 22 laps, bringing the German Grand Prix up to the approximately 500 kilometre race distance used by the majority of Formula One Grands Prix at the time. Mercedes had brought to the Nürburgring their new open-wheeled version of the W196 for Fangio, Kling and Hermann Lang (in a one-off drive) after Mercedes&#x27;s defeat at Silverstone in their streamlined cars. Hans Herrmann drove a streamlined W196s. Qualifying saw Fangio take pole position from Hawthorn, but practice was marred by the death of official Maserati driver Onofre Marimón. Going into the Wehrseifen slight right hand/sharp left hand turn, Marimón&#x27;s Maserati 250F failed to negotiate the corner while going down the downhill run to the corner, plunged down an embankment, the car somersaulted. Marimón was given the last rites by a Catholic priest before dying a few minutes after rescue workers freed him. Marimón&#x27;s teammate Luigi Villoresi withdrew from the race, as did the Maserati of Ken Wharton (entered by Owen Racing) but the team&#x27;s third car for Sergio Mantovani made the race start. Stirling Moss qualified third in his privately entered Maserati 250F ahead of Hans Herrmann (Mercedes-Benz W196s), Gonzalez and Paul Frère (Gordini T16).

Fangio and Karl Kling led the way in their two Mercedes. Hawthorn was an early retirement with a broken axle as were Moss, Frère and privateer Maserati driver Roberto Mieres. Hermann Lang, one of the pre-war stars of the Mercedes &#x27;silver arrows&#x27; spun out of his final Grand Prix appearance after ten laps. Gonzalez started and was running third but was so upset by Marimón&#x27;s death he was called in after 16 laps to hand over to Hawthorn, who set off in pursuit of the Mercedes. He moved into second when Kling pitted and pursued Fangio relentlessly. Late in the race, drizzle forced him to slow and he held second from Trintignant. Kling finished fourth ahead of Mantovani, the last driver to travel the full race distance, getting some points for a saddened Maserati. Kling claimed the fastest lap point.

Just ten of the 23 qualifiers finished the gruelling race. With an elapsed time of 3 hours 45 minutes 45.8 seconds this was the longest (non Indy 500) F1 championship race in history, until the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix, which lasted just over four hours (but in this case it&#x27;s also considered the time with race suspended). The win pushed Fangio further ahead in the championship, now to the point where he had more than double the points of his nearest rival Gonzalez. A win in the next race at the Swiss Grand Prix could wrap up his second championship.

<text>The 1954 Swiss Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Bremgarten on 22 August 1954. It was race 7 of 9 in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. The 66-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from second position. José Froilán González finished second for the Ferrari team and Fangio&#x27;s teammate Hans Herrmann came in third. 

== Race report ==

The Mercedes dominance continued as Juan Manuel Fangio led from start to finish. Stirling Moss soon passed José Froilán González for 2nd and battled ferociously to catch Fangio. However, he was himself soon under pressure as Mike Hawthorn caught him. The two duelled furiously in a superb patriotic spectacle, which ended only when Moss&#x27;s engine gave way. Hawthorn himself succumbed to fuel feed problems. Gonzalez thus ended in second, whilst Fangio lapped the entire field up to second, winning by nearly a minute. Hans Herrmann in the sister Mercedes took the final podium spot.

The Driver&#x27;s championship was to be decided at this race. Works Ferrari driver José Froilán González needed to win to stay in contention to beat Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio on points and after finishing 2nd to Fangio, he still had 23 1/7 points to Fangio&#x27;s 42. With the rules in place at the time, González could not overhaul Fangio&#x27;s total with 2 races left, and so the title went to Fangio for the 2nd time.

This would be the last F1 race in Switzerland. Following the 1955 Le Mans disaster the Swiss government banned all forms of motor racing. Swiss Grands Prix were subsequently held in 1975 (non-championship) and 1982 but both races took place in France.

There would not be any form of circuit motor racing in Switzerland for nearly sixty four years. In 2015, Switzerland lifted their ban on motor racing for electric vehicles only. The first race organized after the ban was lifted was a Formula E Championship race taking place in the streets of Zürich in 2018.

<text>Jani Lane (born John Kennedy Oswald; February 1, 1964 – August 11, 2011) was an American singer and the lead vocalist, frontman, lyricist and main songwriter for the glam metal band Warrant. From Hollywood, California, the band experienced success from 1989 to 1996 with five albums reaching international sales of over 10 million. Lane left Warrant in 2004 and again in 2008 after a brief reunion. Lane also released a solo album, &quot;Back Down to One,&quot; in 2003, and the album &quot;Love the Sin, Hate the Sinner&quot; with a new group, Saints of the Underground, in 2008. Lane contributed lead vocals and songwriting to various projects throughout his career.

== Childhood and youth ==
Lane was born John Kennedy Oswald (later changed to John Patrick Oswald), on February 1, 1964, in Akron, Ohio to Robert and Eileen Oswald. He was raised in Brimfield with four older siblings: sisters Marcine Williams, Michelle Robinson and Victoria Ley, plus older brother Eric, already an accomplished guitarist. With sisters Micki and Vicky and brother Eric harmonizing and playing guitar, Lane taught himself to play drums, guitar and piano by ear by age five. He grew up listening to Cleveland rock station WMMS (100.7 FM &quot;The Buzzard&quot;) and was introduced to a variety of music by his older siblings.

With connections from his brother Eric around the music scene (and with his parents&#x27; help), Lane made a name for himself at a very young age. He played drums under the pseudonym &quot;Mitch Dynamite&quot; in clubs by age 11 especially with a local band &quot;Pokerface.&quot; By that time, his siblings had left for college or marriage, Lane&#x27;s Father &quot;Ozzie&quot; continued to network with local bands and club owners to help promote Jani&#x27;s musical talent in pursuit of his dream. Lane graduated from Field High School in Brimfield in 1982.

Lane is credited as the vocalist/drummer on Warrant&#x27;s &quot;Latest and Greatest&quot; CD. Throughout his career, Lane would sometimes play drums/acoustic guitar and piano with his band and played the drums in various formats and gigs with other musicians.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
After high school, Lane joined the band Cyren, featuring vocalist Skip Hammonds, guitarist John Weakland, bassist Don Hoover (and later Rusty Fohner) with Lane on drums and vocals. Many of Cyren&#x27;s shows opened for a popular local band called Risqué. When Risqué&#x27;s bassist, Al Collins, noticed Lane&#x27;s vocal talents, he convinced Lane to form a new band they eventually called Dorian Gray. The new band also included Steven Chamberlin on drums and Dave Chamberlin on lead guitar. Dorian Gray was designed to have Lane as the lead vocalist and to perform original material, but Lane wasn&#x27;t ready to be the lead singer and quickly returned to the drum kit. Billy Denmead was hired as lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. After only a few shows, Collins left the band, vowing to put a band together when Lane was ready to be a lead vocalist.

Lane moved to Florida in 1983 with Dorian Gray. Eventually deciding to assume a lead vocalist role, he formed Plain Jane with Collins and Chamberlin, adopting the stage name &quot;Jani Lane&quot; (Chamberlin would also soon rechristen himself Steven Sweet). He took the name &quot;Jani&quot; from his German grandparents, who spelled his name &quot;Jani&quot; and pronounced it &quot;Yay-nee.&quot; Lane began vocal training with vocal coach/trainer Ron Feldmann, who introduced him to Creative Engineering, Inc. in Orlando. Lane worked there as a programmer of the animatronic character Dook LaRue, the drummer for The Rock-afire Explosion. His vocal debut was at The Station in Fern Park, Florida.

Lane, Collins, and Chamberlin recorded the first Plain Jane four-track demos at their rented house in Winter Park, Florida. Although reluctant to leave Florida, they rented a trailer in the spring of 1984 and moved to California with hopes of landing a record deal. They were broke by the time they landed at the Hollywood Bowl Motel and resorted to making sandwiches with mustard packets while taking turns calling their parents for cash.

Struggling to make ends meet as a musician, Lane resorted to working in a pornographic video warehouse. The band, along with a new road crew and a few girlfriends, pooled their wages and lived in a two-bedroom condominium rented by new Plain Jane guitarist Paul Noble. At one time, there were 13 people living in the crowded space.

By 1985, Plain Jane had become a regular feature on the Los Angeles club circuit and opened many shows for a band called Warrant. Plain Jane&#x27;s bassist and guitarist both left the band on the same day Warrant&#x27;s singer and drummer quit. Erik Turner, who had founded Warrant in July 1984, was impressed by Plain Jane&#x27;s songwriting and vocal performance and invited Lane and Sweet to jam with his band at Hollywood&#x27;s db Sound in September 1986.

=== Warrant ===
After generating notoriety on the club circuit, Warrant began to attract the attention of record labels. Following an abortive deal with A&amp;M Records over a contribution to the soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure,&quot; the band signed with Columbia Records. The Columbia deal came via the partnering of Warrant and manager Tom Hulett, known for working with The Beach Boys, Elvis Presley, The Moody Blues and others. Hulett became Lane&#x27;s mentor and friend until Hulett&#x27;s death from cancer in 1993.

As lead vocalist with Warrant, Lane wrote all of the material for the band&#x27;s 1989 debut double platinum album, &quot;Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich&quot;, including four Top 40 hit singles: &quot;Down Boys&quot;, &quot;Sometimes She Cries&quot;, &quot;Big Talk&quot; and the No. 2 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit &quot;Heaven.&quot; The album peaked at no. 10 on The Billboard 200. Lane also wrote four Top 40 hit singles (&quot;Cherry Pie,&quot; &quot;I Saw Red,&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;Blind Faith&quot;) for the second album, the 1990 double platinum &quot;Cherry Pie,&quot; which peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard 200. Lane also co-wrote and performed with Warrant the song &quot;The Power&quot; in the 1992 movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;. In 1992, Warrant released &quot;Dog Eat Dog,&quot; their gold third album, which peaked at no. 25 on the Billboard 200.

Lane left Warrant in March 1993 to pursue a solo career. He returned six months later, helping the band secure a new record with Tom Lipsky of CMC International. Warrant recorded &quot;Ultraphobic&quot; in 1995, &quot;Belly to Belly&quot; in 1996, &quot;Greatest &amp; Latest&quot; in 1999 and a cover album, &quot;Under the Influence,&quot; in 2001.

Due to personal and business disagreements, Lane left Warrant again in 2004. In January 2008, the band&#x27;s agent, The William Morris Agency, issued a new photograph of the band with Lane prominently featured, confirming his return to the band. It was the first time that all original members had been in the band since 1993. The band&#x27;s first show with all original members was in May 2008 in Nashville, Tennessee. Warrant performed a series of shows during the summer of 2008, but by September, the band and Lane agreed to move forward separately due to &quot;too much water under the bridge.&quot; Warrant and Lane both continued to perform Lane&#x27;s compositions live and Lane continued to write for himself and other artists.

=== Solo career ===
Lane became involved in acting in the early 1990s. He made a brief appearance in &quot;Caged Fear&quot; and appeared in &quot;High Strung&quot; in 1991.

In 1993, Lane started working on his first solo project. Titled &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; the album represented a significant musical departure from previous work. Between 1997 and 2000, demos of Lane&#x27;s solo material began surfacing on the Internet, with some bids on eBay reaching an estimated $100 per copy. In 2002, Lane decided to postpone the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; project and released a new project as his debut solo album. The &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; project remained unreleased.

Lane&#x27;s official debut solo album, &quot;Back Down to One&quot;, was released on June 17, 2003, through &quot;Z Records&quot; and in the U.S. in 2006 on Immortal/Sidewinder Records. It carried a &quot;power pop&quot; sound more closely aligned with the sound of Warrant than &quot;Jabberwocky.&quot; Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Lane was admitted to a rehabilitation center for alcohol and drug-related exhaustion.

In August 2004, Lane withdrew from the &quot;Bad Boys of Metal&quot; tour after only eight shows.

In the fall of 2004, Lane contributed lead vocals for the first ever theme song to a novel, Billy McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Devil of Shakespeare,&quot; along with James Young from Styx, Ron Flynt of 20/20 and Chip Z&#x27;Nuff of Enuff Z&#x27;Nuff.

Lane contributed vocals on the track &quot;Bastille Day&quot; and &quot;2112 Overture/Temples of Syrinx&quot; for the Magna Carta 2005 Rush tribute album &quot;Subdivisions.&quot;

Lane had success with the &quot;VH1 Classic Metal Mania: Stripped&quot; discs, where the acoustic version of &quot;I Saw Red&quot; was included on disc 1, a new acoustic swinging version of &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; featured on disc 2, and a new acoustic version of &quot;Heaven&quot; featured on disc 3.

In 2005, Lane became a fan favorite on the popular VH1 series &quot;Celebrity Fit Club 2&quot;. His problems with alcohol were highlighted and many viewers supported his efforts at recovery.

With the reissue and U.S. release of &quot;Back Down to One&quot; in 2006, Lane attempted to restart his version of Warrant. Although &quot;Back Down to One&quot; was credited as a solo release, Lane assembled a new touring band called &quot;Jani Lane&#x27;s Warrant.&quot; The band&#x27;s first shows in Michigan were stopped by legal action from former bandmates objecting to his use of the Warrant logo on his posters. Lane subsequently continued touring without the Warrant name and logo.

Lane lent his vocals to numerous tribute CDs during the 2000s. In 2007, he released a solo cover album titled &quot;Photograph,&quot; featuring a collection of his tribute contributions.

Keri Kelli and Lane wrote a song for Alice Cooper titled &quot;The One That Got Away.&quot; It was recorded by Cooper on his 2008 record &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;. Lane also finished work on a side project, Saints of the Underground, which included Kelli and Bobby Blotzer and Robbie Crane, (both from Ratt). Their album, &quot;Love the Sin, Hate the Sinner,&quot; was released on April 22, 2008, by Warrior Records, and was mixed by producer/engineer Andy Johns, who&#x27;d worked with The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. The album featured additional bass work by Chuck Wright (Quiet Riot, House of Lords). The band was originally called &quot;Angel City Outlaws&quot; when they posted their first two promo singles, &quot;Bruised&quot; and &quot;Exit.&quot;

In summer 2010, Lane toured with Great White, filling in for singer Jack Russell, who was recuperating from surgery after suffering internal complications.

== Personal life ==
During the shooting of Warrant&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; video, Lane met model Bobbie Brown, who starred in the video, and they married in July 1991. They had a daughter, Taylar, in 1992 and divorced in 1993. Their relationship was recounted in Brown&#x27;s 2013 autobiography, &quot;Dirty Rocker Boys&quot;, co-written with Caroline Ryder. In 1996, Lane married actress Rowanne Brewer, a former Miss Maryland USA. They had a daughter, Madison, in 1997 and divorced in 2005. In 2011, Lane married his third wife, Kimberly Nash.

== Death ==
On August 11, 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department and local news stations announced that Lane was found dead of acute alcohol poisoning at a Comfort Inn hotel in Woodland Hills, California at the age of 47. Lane was pronounced dead by fire department personnel who responded to a call shortly before 5:30 p.m.

A public memorial concert with performances by Great White, Quiet Riot, Enuff Z&#x27;Nuff, Dario, and L.A. Guns was held on August 29 at the Key Club in Hollywood.

In 2011, a biopic titled &quot;Cherry Pie Guy&quot; about Lane&#x27;s life was announced. Radio personality and comedian Jeff Dandurand was said to portray Jani and also direct the film. As of 2022, the film was still in development and was expected to start filming in 2023.

<text>Linköping Football Club is an association football club from Linköping, Sweden. The club was established in 2003 when Kenty DFF women&#x27;s football club decided to merge with the premier division ice hockey club Linköping HC under the new name Linköping FC. The club&#x27;s goal was both to establish women&#x27;s football as a sport in Linköping and eventually become one of the top four teams.

==History==
In 2004, Linköping FC finished their first year in the women&#x27;s premier division (Damallsvenskan) in sixth place. The following two seasons the club reached its goal of finishing top four in the league with a fourth-place finish in 2005 and a third-place finish in 2006. The club also won Svenska Cupen (&quot;The Swedish Cup&quot;) for the first time in 2006, defeating Umeå IK 3–2 in the cup final. They finished sixth in 2007 which was a failure for the club. In 2008 they led a long time through the series but still they finished second behind Swedish giants Umeå IK. Though, some consolation came when they won Svenska Cupen the same season, beating Umeå 1–0 in the final.

From 2004 to 2007 Linköping FC increased their annual turnover from 2,4 million SEK to 5,0 million SEK. At the same time their average attendance dropped from 1,609 in the 2004 season to 997 in 2006. In 2007, Frida Östberg left the team after two years. Later, the team signed Jessica Landström after her debut for the national team. In February, they signed Brazilian internationals Cristiane and Daniela.

<text>Politeia () is an ancient Greek word used in Greek political thought, especially that of Plato and Aristotle. Derived from the word &quot;polis&quot; (&quot;city-state&quot;), it has a range of meanings from &quot;the rights of citizens&quot; to a &quot;form of government&quot;.

==English translations of the Greek word==
According to Liddell and Scott&#x27;s &quot;Greek-English Lexicon&quot; a meaning of &quot;politeia&quot; is &quot;the conditions and rights of the citizen, or citizenship&quot;, analogous to the Latin &quot;civitas&quot;.

&quot;Politeia&quot;, in Greek means the community of citizens in a city / state. It should not be confused with &quot;regime&quot; that is meant by &quot;politeuma&quot; or &quot;Status quo&quot; that is meant by &quot;&quot;. &quot;Politeuma&quot; is the word describing the political situation of the community of citizens in a city/state, and &quot;kathestos&quot; means also the general situation of an object, an agreement, or something else.

&quot;Politeia&quot; is derived from both the root word &quot;polis&quot; meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;state&quot;, and from the verb &quot;politeuomai&quot; that means &quot;I am living as an active citizen of the polis&quot;.

People living in a Greek city/state were not necessarily citizens. A person that was ostracized from the active matrix of the city was an example of such. Another example was people who lived in the city but were not active citizens who had a say in the political processes of the community. Women, slaves and others who Greek men deemed unworthy were not in the active matrix of the political formations of that city state, making them not-citizens, so not part of &quot;politeia&quot;.

In the works of ancient Greek philosophers, the principal meaning of &quot;politeia&quot; appears to be: &quot;how a polis is run; constitution&quot;. A &quot;politeia&quot; differs from modern written constitutions in two respects: first, not all Greek states put their laws in writing; more importantly, the Greeks did not normally distinguish between ordinary and constitutional legislation. If a certain body had the power to change the laws, it had the power to change the laws controlling its own power and membership—even to abolish itself and set up a new governing body.

The phrases &quot;system of government&quot;, &quot;state organisation&quot;, &quot;form of government&quot;, and, more recently, &quot;régime&quot; have also been used to translate &quot;politeia&quot;. &quot;Régime&quot; has drawbacks: it is ambiguous where &quot;politeia&quot; is not. It has a negative tone in English, which &quot;politeia&quot; does not in Greek. It is also a loan-word; and in that regard, has no advantage over simply adopting &quot;politeia&quot; itself.

Some translators thus use a different term for this second meaning of &quot;politeia&quot;. Most common is the vague term polity. Specific translations of this second meaning as &quot;constitutional democracy&quot; or &quot;republic&quot; are at least anachronistic, and in most instances contentious and/or inaccurate. Some translators feel it is incorrect to translate the same word in different ways, arguing that the ambiguity must have been deliberate and that it is impossible to always know which way the word should be rendered.

In the Greek New Testament &quot;politeia&quot; is translated as &quot;commonwealth&quot; or &quot;freedom&quot; in Ephesians 2:12 and Acts 22:28.

==&quot;Politeia&quot; in the work of the authors of Antiquity==

===Plato and Cicero===
&quot;Politeia&quot; is the original title of the book by Plato now commonly known in English as &quot;Republic&quot;. Cicero translated &quot;politeia&quot; as &quot;res publica&quot; (see also: &quot;De re publica&quot;), from which the modern word republic comes. Note that the meanings the ancient Romans attached to &quot;res publica&quot; were also multiple and only partially overlapping with the Greek &quot;politeia&quot;, and further that few of the multiple meanings of &quot;politeia&quot; or &quot;res publica&quot; are much of an equivalent to &quot;republic&quot; as it is understood in modern political science.

===Aristotle===
In the &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot; (&quot;Athenaion Politeia&quot;), Aristotle uses &quot;politeia&quot; for eleven states of the Athenian government up to his own time, from the absolute monarchy of Ionia and the tyranny of the Thirty to the democratic Assembly and selection by lot of Pericles&#x27;s time and his own. He may have added that the absolute monarchy of Ion was &quot;less political&quot; than that of Theseus or the later constitutions, but the text is doubtful.

In his &quot;Politics&quot;, Aristotle clearly uses &quot;politeia&quot; both as above and also in a more restricted sense. Exactly what this sense is, and whether Aristotle is using it in a consistent manner, have both been long debated. By careful choice of quotation (a comprehensive list of quotations along with their respective cross-references is found in ), all of the following can be defended:
*A specific form of government. Aristotle classified constitutions on two grounds: how many citizens had a voice in making the laws; and whether they did so considering the good of all citizens, or only their own. Along with monarchy and aristocracy, &quot;politeia&quot; is one of the three virtuous forms of government. While monarchy is the rule by the single most virtuous one, and aristocracy is the rule by the several most virtuous few, &quot;politeia&quot; is the rule by the multitude of virtuous citizens. 
*A constitution that does not fit into this sixfold classification, because it has features of more than one of them: the constitutions of Carthage, Sparta, and [at least one of the cities of] Crete.
*A constitution which mixes oligarchy and democracy (terms which, as used by Aristotle, refer to vicious types of constitutions).
*A constitution in which the hoplites governed. This is more restrictive than the Athens of Aristotle&#x27;s time. Athens was a naval power, and many citizens were allowed to vote, and served the state well in war, who could not afford massive metal armor.

In Book III of his &quot;Politics&quot; (1279a), Aristotle seems to indicate that, in principle, &quot;politeia&quot; refers generically to any form of government or constitution, although he uses the word also to call a particular form of government: &quot;When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments &quot;(politeion)&quot;, government (&quot;politeia&quot;).&quot;

Why Aristotle uses the same term to refer to at least two distinct ideas has confused readers for millennia. For instance, later Aristotle refers to the ideal &quot;politeia&quot; as one using a mixed government. But it is uncertain whether he is referring to governments in general or to a specific form.

In the New Testament &quot;politeia&quot; refers both the Greek World as well as to the nation of Israel. Strong&#x27;s Concordance defines the term as: Signifies (a) &quot;the relation in which a citizen stands to the state, the condition of a citizen, citizenship&quot;, Acts 22:28, &quot;with a great sum obtained I this citizenship&quot; (KJV, &quot;freedom&quot;). While Paul&#x27;s &quot;citizenship&quot; of Tarsus was not of advantage outside that city, yet his Roman &quot;citizenship&quot; availed throughout the Roman Empire and, besides private rights, included (1) exemption from all degrading punishments; (2) a right of appeal to the emperor after a sentence; (3) a right to be sent to Rome for trial before the emperor if charged with a capital offense. Paul&#x27;s father might have obtained &quot;citizenship&quot; (1) by manumission; (2) as a reward of merit; (3) by purchase; the contrast implied in Acts 22:28 is perhaps against the last mentioned; (b) &quot;a civil polity, the condition of a state, a commonwealth&quot;, said of Israel, Ephesians 2:12.

<text>Richard Michael &quot;Kip&quot; Carpenter (14 August 1929 – 26 February 2012) was an English screenwriter, author and actor. He created a number of British television series, including &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; and &quot;Catweazle&quot;.

==Early life==
Carpenter was born in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, and educated at Downham Market Grammar School (now Downham Market Academy. He attended the Old Vic Theatre School before starting an acting career by working in repertory theatre.

==Career==
Carpenter appeared in occasional films, but was mostly active on British TV in the 1960s as a character actor, on one occasion opposite Tony Hancock in one of his last shows for the BBC, commonly known as &quot;The Bowmans&quot;. Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;The Baron&quot;.

In 1969, Carpenter created &quot;Catweazle&quot;, the children&#x27;s series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers&#x27; Guild award for creating the cult children&#x27;s TV series.

During the 1970s, he wrote the series &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot; (1976–1978), &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1979–1982), parts of the series &quot;The Famous Five&quot; and &quot;Doctor Snuggles&quot;, and 17 episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Black Beauty&quot; for ITV; and &quot;Cloud Burst&quot;, &quot;The Boy from Space &quot; and &quot;The King&#x27;s Dragon&quot; as part of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Look and Read&quot; (1967–2004) programme for schools, He presented all episodes of &quot;Cloud Burst&quot;.

In the 1980s came the historical adventures &quot;Smuggler (TV series)&quot; and its later antipodean-based follow-up &quot;Adventurer (TV series)  &quot; and between them, the lavish HTV production &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, which ran for three series. 

As Anthony Hayward wrote in this cited obituary:
Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s (&quot;The Winjin&#x27; Pom&quot;, &quot;Stanley&#x27;s Dragon&quot; and &quot;Out of Sight&quot;), some of which (&quot;The Borrowers&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Borrowers&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;) were based on classic novels.

Carpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created: &quot;Catweazle&quot;, &quot;Cloud Burst&quot;, &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot;, &quot;Smuggler&quot;, &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (two books) and two books of &quot;Dick Turpin&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carpenter married Annabelle Lee in 1954. They lived in Ayot Bury, Ayot St Peter near Welwyn in Hertfordshire, had two children and remained married until his death.

==Death==
On 26 February 2012, at the age of 82, Carpenter died in Hertfordshire from a pulmonary embolism.

<text>The Old Gaol, also known as the Manor Office, is a custodial building in Hallgate in Hexham, Northumberland, England. The building, which now operates as a museum, is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The gaol was commissioned by the Archbishop of York, William Melton. It was designed in the Medieval style, built in rubble masonry and was completed in January 1332.

The design involved a three-storey rectangular building facing onto Hallgate. On the ground floor, there was originally a doorway on the left: this was subsequently replaced by a bi-partite mullioned window with cusped heads, and a new arched doorway with an architrave was inserted in the centre. The upper floors were originally largely blind: new fenestration was later added to these floors: on the first floor, additions included two pairs of lancet windows on the right and a single lancet window on the left, while on the second floor, additions included a bi-partite mullioned window with cusped heads on the right and two small single windows on the left. The building was surmounted by heavily corbeled eaves. Internally, the principal rooms were the two vaulted cells in the basement. The spaces on the other floors were largely for the administration of the prison.

The building held prisoners from Hexhamshire and, in the 16th century, also from the English Middle March: the prisoners were held in the gaol on a temporary basis awaiting their trial in the courtroom in the nearby Moot Hall. The building remains one of the oldest purpose-built prisons in England.

During the Hexham Riot in 1761, when a crowd protesting about changes in the criteria for serving in the militia, rioters were fired upon by troops from the North Yorkshire Militia in the Market Place. Some 45 protesters were killed, and many others were incarcerated in the gaol. After the prisoners had been transferred to Morpeth Gaol, the prison closed in 1820. It was then converted for use as a bank and a solicitor&#x27;s office.

The old gaol became the home of the 2nd Northumberland Rifle Volunteers when it was formed in 1860 and remained in use as such until Hencotes drill hall was completed in 1891. During the Second World War, it served as a fire lookout tower. The building reopened as a museum in 1980. Topics covered include archaeology, archives, costume and textiles, law and order, music, photography, social history, weapons and war. The collections include 15th and 16th century arms and armour, and objects of local historical interest. The Border Library holds the &quot;Butler Collection&quot;, which is a series of books, recordings and music relating to the culture of the Borders, assembled by the former Chairman of the Northumbria Tourist Board, William Butler.

<doc id="1122120" wikidata="Q3181636" url="?curid=1122120" title="John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath">
<text>John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath PC (29 August 1628 – 22 August 1701) was an English landowner who served in the Royalist army during the First English Civil War and was rewarded for his services after the 1660 Stuart Restoration with a title and various appointments.

==Personal details==
John was born on 29 August 1628 at Kilkhampton in Cornwall, the third son of Sir Bevil Grenville (1596–1643) and Grace Smythe (died 1647). His aunt Elizabeth Smythe was the mother of George Monck who played a leading role in the 1660 Stuart Restoration and it was this connection that later resulted in Grenville being raised to the peerage as Earl of Bath.

One of thirteen children, John&#x27;s two elder brothers died prematurely, making him heir to his father&#x27;s considerable estates when Sir Bevil was killed at the Battle of Lansdowne in 1643.

==Career==

During the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Granville fought in the regiment raised by his father for Charles I (1625–1649). Created a knight after the Storming of Bristol in 1643, he was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the future Charles II and accompanied him into exile. When the Second English Civil War began in 1648, Charles appointed him Governor of the Scilly Isles, which had rebelled against its Parliamentary garrison. As a base for Royalist privateers attacking English and Dutch vessels in the Western Approaches, this was a vital source of funding for the exiled Court; in May 1651, Parliamentary forces under Robert Blake retook the islands and Granville was captured.

On his release, Granville remained in England and continued to be active in Royalist conspiracies. In 1660, he served as an intermediary in the negotiations between Charles and his distant relative George Monck that led to the Restoration. To his disappointment, the Dukedom of Albemarle went to Monck, whom Charles also rewarded with the then-enormous pension of £7,000 per year. Instead, he was created Baron Granville, Viscount Granville and Earl of Bath in 1661, and a Privy Councillor in 1663.

In 1665, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, although he never went there and spent large sums of time and money on rebuilding the family home of Stowe House in Cornwall. Widely admired, it was dismantled in 1739, although many of its ornamental features, including entire rooms, can be seen at the Guildhall in South Molton, Devon. Albemarle also expanded his own ancestral seat of Potheridge, about 18 miles to the east; unfinished on his death, it was badly damaged by fire and demolished in 1734.

Granville was a signatory to &quot;The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa&quot;, a document published in 1667 which led to the creation of the Royal Africa Company. This is speculated to have been influenced by the fact that Granville was close friends with the Royal African Company&#x27;s leader, the Duke of York (and future King James II), who was brother to Charles II.

Under James II, Granville served as colonel of the Earl of Bath&#x27;s Regiment, later 10th Foot, first during the June 1685 Monmouth Rebellion and again in 1688. During the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, he commanded the key ports of Exeter and Plymouth but defected to William III on 18 November.

He was rewarded by being made Lord Lieutenant of Devon but again failed to gain the title of Albemarle and the legal dispute over the Albemarle estate almost bankrupted him. Two weeks after his death in August 1701, his son Charles shot himself, apparently overwhelmed by the debts he had inherited.

==Marriage and progeny==

In October 1652 at Kilkhampton John Granville married Jane Wyche, a daughter of Sir Peter Wyche, English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. By his wife, he had five children:

===Sons===
*Charles Granville, 2nd Earl of Bath (1661–1701), eldest son and heir. He died from a gunshot wound during the preparations for his father&#x27;s funeral, possibly suicide. He was twice married, firstly to Lady Martha Osborne, daughter of Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds (d. 11 September 1689, aged 25), and secondly, on 10 March 1691, to Isabella van Nassau (bapt. 20 April 1668, d. in childbirth on 30 January 1692 at London), sister of Henry Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham. He had no children by his first wife, but by his second wife was the father of:
**William Henry Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692–1711), who died of smallpox aged 19 without progeny when the earldom became extinct.
*John Granville, 1st Baron Granville of Potheridge (1665–1707). Potheridge in Devon was the ancient seat of the Monck family, where the 1st Earl of Bath&#x27;s cousin, close friend and collaborator in the Restoration of the Monarchy, George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608–1670) had built a grand mansion. It was settled on the 1st Earl of Bath by the Duke&#x27;s childless son Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (1653–1688), and eventually passed to the Leveson-Gower family (see below).

===Daughters===
*Lady Jane Granville (d. 27 February 1696), wife of Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet and mother of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Baron Gower. The progeny of this marriage were co-heirs to the 3rd Earl of Bath. Her great-grandson was Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford (1721–1803) one of whose younger sons was Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville (1773–1846).
*Lady Catherine Granville, wife of Craven Peyton, Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge 1705–1713. Without progeny.

*Lady Grace Granville, &quot;suo jure&quot; 1st Countess Granville (3 September 1654 – 18 October 1744), wife of George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret of Haynes Park, Bedfordshire, and mother of John Carteret, 2nd Baron Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. The progeny of this marriage, Barons Carteret, Earls Granville, and Marquesses of Bath (Thynne), were co-heirs to the 3rd Earl of Bath.

==Death==
He died in London in 1701, one week before his 73rd birthday.

==Armorials==
The armorials of the family of Granville / Grenville of Glamorgan, Devon and Cornwall are of certain form but uncertain blazon. The charges appear in the form of musical pipes of a wind instrument, similar to pan-pipes. Authoritative sources on heraldry suggest the charges to be variously &quot;clarions&quot; (used by Guillim (d. 1621)), the most usual blazon, which are, however, generally defined as a form of trumpet; &quot;rests&quot; is another common blazon, denoting lance-rests supposedly used by a mounted knight; &quot;organ-rests&quot; is also met with, a seemingly meaningless term (Gibbon (1682)). Other terms are &quot;clavicymbal&quot;, &quot;clarichord&quot; and &quot;sufflue&quot; (used by Leigh in his Armory of 1562 and by Boswell, 1572), the latter being a device for blowing (French: souffler) air into an organ. Guillim suggested the charge may be a rudder, but in which case it is shown upside down, when compared to that charge used for example on the tomb at Callington of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke. Certainly in the brasses on the chest tomb of Sir John Bassett (d. 1529) in Atherington Church, Devon, the charges are engraved in tubular forms with vents or reeds as used in true organ pipes.

<text>The 1954 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 24 October 1954 at Pedralbes. It was the ninth and final race in the 1954 World Championship of Drivers. The 80-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Mike Hawthorn after he started from third position. Luigi Musso finished second for the Maserati team and Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio came in third.

== Race report ==

The long-awaited Lancia D50s arrived-using their 90 degree V8 engine as a stiffening aid for the chassis; they were simple but brilliantly designed. Alberto Ascari immediately set the fastest practice lap and led from pole.

Luigi Villoresi in the fellow Lancia retired with brake trouble after just 1 lap and Ascari succumbed to clutch problems after 9 laps. 

Various other drivers took the lead and then retired; Harry Schell spun off, Maurice Trintignant had mechanical problems and Stirling Moss overheated (one of several retirements caused by flying newspaper jamming the radiator ducts). The race boiled down to a duel between Mike Hawthorn and Juan Manuel Fangio but the Argentine was losing oil and lost second place to Luigi Musso. Hawthorn hung on to take the win with Fangio driving well to claim the final podium position.

This proved to be the last major race held at the Pedralbes street circuit. The Le Mans disaster in 1955 meant tighter safety regulations, and the spectator-lined street circuit in the Pedralbes neighborhood of Barcelona was abandoned and has not been used since.

<text>The 1955 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Buenos Aires on 16 January 1955. It was race 1 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers and the third running of the Argentine Grand Prix.

The race was won from third on the grid by Juan Manuel Fangio for Mercedes. Ferrari drivers Nino Farina and Maurice Trintignant finished both second and third in two three-way shared drives with José Froilán González and Umberto Maglioli respectively. The high temperatures of the Argentinian summer proved to be very taxing for both drivers and cars. Fangio and Roberto Mieres were the only two drivers able to complete the race without handing their car to another driver.

According to former Ferrari and Maserati chief mechanic Giulio Borsari, Fangio acclimatized himself by moving to Argentina one month prior to the race and reducing his water consumption to one liter a day to cope with the extreme heat. Fangio also suffered severe burns to his leg which, for the entire duration of the race, was rubbing against the chassis frame which was being heated by the exhaust. It took him 3 months to recover; his next race in Monaco was not until late May. It left a permanent scar on his leg later in life.

<text>The 1955 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 22 May 1955. It was race 2 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers and was given an honorary name, &quot;Grand Prix d&#x27;Europe&quot;. The 100-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Maurice Trintignant after he started from ninth position. Eugenio Castellotti finished second for the Lancia team and Maserati drivers Jean Behra and Cesare Perdisa came in third.

== Race report ==

Stirling Moss had been signed by Mercedes for the new season and Maserati had replaced him with Jean Behra. The Silver Arrows of Fangio and Moss dominated, running 1–2 until half distance, trailed by Ascari and Castellotti. At the halfway mark, Fangio retired with transmission trouble, giving the lead to Moss. Almost a lap ahead, a seemingly sure win for Moss was ended on Lap 80 when his Benz&#x27;s engine blew. The new leader, Ascari, miscalculated the chicane coming out of the tunnel, and his Lancia crashed through the barriers into the harbour. Ascari had to swim to safety. Maurice Trintignant, in a Ferrari 625 thought to be uncompetitive, inherited the lead and scored his first Formula One victory.

Mercedes driver Hans Herrmann injured himself in practice and was replaced by André Simon.

This race marked the Grand Prix debut for Cesare Perdisa. It was the only Grand Prix appearance for Ted Whiteaway. This was the last Grand Prix appearance for Alberto Ascari; he was killed four days later testing a Ferrari sports car at Monza.

It was the first win for Maurice Trintignant and Englebert tyres. It was also the first podium and points for Eugenio Castellotti and Cesare Perdisa, and the first win for a French Formula One driver.

;Notes
* – 1 point for fastest lap

==Shared drives==
** Car #34: Jean Behra (42 laps) and Cesare Perdisa (57 laps). They shared the 4 points for third place.
** Car #48: Piero Taruffi (50 laps) and Paul Frère (36 laps).
** Car #40: Cesare Perdisa (40 laps) and Jean Behra (46 laps).

==Summary==
* Formula 1 debut for Cesare Perdisa, who shared third place drive with Jean Behra, and Ted Whiteaway, who failed to quality
* Juan Manuel Fangio broke the track record that had stood since 1937, when Rudolf Caracciola turned a lap in 1:46.5 in a 5.6-litre Mercedes W125, running the circuit in 1:41.1 on the first day of practice in his Mercedes W196.
* Alberto Ascari matched Fangio&#x27;s time in his Lancia D50 during the Saturday practice, though the order had been set on the first day of practice in a singular exception to the policy of the time of all practice laps counting towards grid position.
* In practice, Mercedes youngster Hans Herrmann crashed into a harbour wall and suffered injuries that took him out for the rest of the season.
* Ascari was driving the number 26 car, the same number that had been on the P2 Alfa Romeo his father, Antonio Ascari, had been driving when killed in the 26 July 1925 French Grand Prix. The superstitious Ascari was between Mercedes drivers Fangio and Stirling Moss in the numbers 2 and 6 respectively.
* Andre Simon&#x27;s was the first Mercedes to leave the race, with engine failure. Of the other Mercedes, Fangio left the race with transmission problems on lap 50, leaving Stirling Moss in first and Ascari in second. Lap 80 saw Moss taken out by a minor problem in his car&#x27;s sophisticated valve train, leaving Ascari in first. Ascari never made it past the pits to see that, however: his Lancia didn&#x27;t make the chicane (possibly losing traction on oil from Moss&#x27;s engine failure) and he flipped over the barrier and into the harbour. His Lancia was craned out of 25 feet of water while he spent the night in the hospital.
* Later events indicate that he probably should have kept his superstitions up and taken this as an omen, but his motivation wouldn&#x27;t quit and four days later he was back in the cockpit at Monza, where he was killed in a bizarre accident testing a Ferrari on the 26th of the month. There are no definite explanations for either of Ascari&#x27;s accidents, but the Monza incident was, apart from possible undetected brain injuries after the Monaco crash, probably caused by an improperly-sized tire – 7.00x16 rather than 6.50x16 – combined with an imperfect track surface.
* Mercedes also had not seen the last of their troubles – after all three cars left contention with mechanical problems at Monaco, the worst accident in racing history involved a Mercedes.
* Louis Chiron&#x27;s start made him the oldest driver to start a Grand Prix (55 years, 292 days).

<text>The 39th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday, May 30, 1955. The event was race 1 of 11 of the 1955 AAA National Championship Trail and was race 3 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers.

The race is notable to many as the race in which Bill Vukovich was killed in a crash while seemingly on his way to an unprecedented third consecutive Indy 500 win.

==Time trials==
Time trials was scheduled for four days.

===Saturday May 14 – Pole Day time trials===

Gusty winds, as well as the threat of rain, was observed on pole day, therefore nearly all of the competitors stayed off the track. Around the garage area, the drivers and teams agreed amongst themselves to sit out time trials for the afternoon, and instead qualify together in better conditions on Sunday. However, in the final 20 minutes, Jerry Hoyt, who had not been informed about the agreement, suddenly put his car in line, and pulled away for an unexpected qualifying attempt. His speed of 140.045 mph was not spectacular, but as the fastest (and only) car thus far of the day, he sat on the pole position. Without hesitation, Tony Bettenhausen, Sr. took to the track moments later. After two fast laps, he was slowed by a gust of wind, and qualified second. Sam Hanks and Pat O&#x27;Connor got their cars ready, but neither were able to complete attempts. The day closed with only two cars in the field, and Hoyt the surprising pole winner – to the dismay of several in the garage area.

===Sunday May 15 – Second day time trials===

Qualifying resumed in better conditions, and most of the drivers who stayed off the track Saturday took to the track on Sunday. Jack McGrath (142.580 mph) was the fastest qualifier, and lined up third. Hoyt&#x27;s pole-winning speed from the day before ended up being only the 8th-fastest overall in the field – a record slowest ranked pole speed.

Near the end of the day, Manny Ayulo crashed due to a possible steering fault and died the following day.

===Saturday May 21 – Third day time trials===
Paul Russo, attempting to qualify the #18 Novi for Troy Ruttman, suffers a broken gearbox. This was the last appearance of a front-drive car at Indy.

===Sunday May 22 – Fourth day time trials===

==Race recap==
===Start===
Jack McGrath, starting from the outside despite the fastest qualifying time, grabbed the initial lead, but was quickly challenged by Bill Vukovich, who was looking for his third consecutive win. Vukovich took the lead on lap four, surrendering it back to McGrath on lap 15 but regaining it on lap 16. Fred Agabashian, who had finished in the top ten the previous two years spun on lap 39 and could not continue. McGrath chased Vukovich until lap 54, when he pulled over with mechanical problems. Despite getting out of the car and attempting to repair it himself, he was forced to drop out with a magneto issue.

===Lap 56, Vukovich crash===
With Vukovich having a considerable lead on lap 56, Rodger Ward, several laps down, flipped over twice, either due to a problem with the wind, oil, or breaking an axle. Although he landed on his wheels, the car was facing the wrong way. Al Keller, attempting to avoid Ward, turned to the inside, going close to or on to the grass, before turning hard to the right and coming quickly back up the track and contacting Johnny Boyd. Boyd&#x27;s car careened into Vukovich, who appeared to be attempting to also go to the left of Ward. Vukovich made a last-second attempt to avoid Boyd to the right, but Boyd&#x27;s car sent Vukovich hard into the outside barrier. Vukovich&#x27;s front end also lifted into the air, causing the front to clear the barrier and the car to contact it with the rear, sending the car into a cartwheel, during which it hit several vehicles parked outside the track, and possibly a pole. The car burst into flames after it came to rest, and Vukovich died from injuries from the crash. Boyd&#x27;s car also flipped but he and the other drivers escaped major injury. Driver Ed Elisian stopped his car on the infield and ran across the track in an attempt to help Vukovich.

===Remainder of race===
After 27 minutes of running under caution, Jimmy Bryan took over the lead of the race, but was forced to retire after ninety laps with a fuel pump issue, when the lead was taken over by Bob Sweikert. The only other driver to retire due to contact for the remainder of the race was Cal Niday on lap 170. Art Cross led the race from laps 133 to 156, but after surrendering the lead to Don Freeland was forced to retire due to mechanical trouble on lap 168. Freeland similarly was passed by Sweikert on lap 160, and retired on lap 178. Sweikert led the remainder of the race. Sweikert stated that the winds made racing difficult, and perhaps led to a decision of racing cautiously and taking advantage of other&#x27;s difficulty.

== Aftermath ==
The two deaths in the 500 were part of a particularly deadly year for motorsports, which also included four other Indy drivers dying in other races, Alberto Ascari being killed while testing a sports car at Monza, and a horrific accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans which saw nearly 100 fatalities including Pierre Levegh who was driving at the time of the accident. Following the year the American Automobile Association ceased sanctioning auto races (including the Indy 500) and the United States Auto Club (USAC) was formed to handle sanctioning duties. It would take until 1959 for fire suits to be made mandatory for all drivers and roll bars for all cars after Jerry Unser&#x27;s fatal accident at the 1959 Indianapolis 500.

===Race statistics===



== Additional stats ==
* Pole position: Jerry Hoyt – 1:04.27 (while Hoyt started on the pole, Jack McGrath set the fastest time but started on the outside of the first row)
* Fastest Lead Lap: Bill Vukovich – 1:03.67
* Shared Drives:
** Car #10: Tony Bettenhausen (123 laps) and Paul Russo (77 laps). They shared the 6 points for second place.
** Car #77: Walt Faulkner (176 laps) and Bill Homeier (24 laps). They shared the 2 points for fifth place.
* While in the lead, Bill Vukovich hit the 3-car pileup of Al Keller, Johnny Boyd, and Rodger Ward. He was killed (by fracture to the skull) when his car became airborne and went out of the course on the back long straightaway, landing upside down and on fire. His death concluded a streak of three straight years leading the most laps in the race (likely to have been four straight, 1955 inclusive), a feat unequaled since.
* Formula 1 championship debut for Keith Andrews, Johnny Boyd, Ray Crawford, Al Herman, Al Keller, Eddie Russo, Shorty Templeman and Chuck Weyant

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. The broadcast was carried by 237 affiliates in all 48 states, as well as Armed Forces Radio. The broadcast was dedicated to the memory of Wilbur Shaw, who was killed in a plane crash in October.

Luke Walton reported from the north pits for the third year. Charlie Brockman, in his fourth appearance on the network, conducted the winner&#x27;s interview in victory lane.

All five of the major radio stations in the Indianapolis area carried the broadcast. The broadcast was notable as it reported the fatal crash of Bill Vukovich.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1955 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 7 on the 1955 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Race winner Bob Sweikert earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished seventh in the final season standings.

<text>The 1955 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on June 5, 1955. It was race 4 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers. The 36-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from second position. His teammate Stirling Moss finished second and Ferrari driver Nino Farina came in third.

== Race report ==

Harry Schell set a grid time but his car was driven by teammate Maurice Trintignant. This was the easiest of wins for Mercedes. With the absence of Lancia, there was very little competition. Fangio disappeared into the distance with Moss tracking him round. Private entrant Eugenio Castellotti retired after 16 laps, Jean Behra crashed and Hawthorn&#x27;s Vanwall had an oil leak.
The domination of the silver cars was such that they came in over 2 minutes ahead of Farina in third place after he had lost a great deal of time attempting unsuccessfully to pass Castellotti.

<text>The 1955 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on June 19, 1955. It was race 5 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers. The 100-lap race was won by Mercedes driver Juan Manuel Fangio after he started from pole position. His teammate Stirling Moss finished second and Maserati driver Luigi Musso came in third.

This ended a 35-race streak of a Ferrari (powered car) ending on a podium since the 1950 French Grand Prix (excluding the Indianapolis 500). 

== Race report ==

Despite a track made slippery by continuous drizzle, the record crowd was treated to some outstanding driving as the masters slid their machines through the sand-dunes. Fangio and Moss again took up the lead with Musso&#x27;s Maserati in pursuit. Kling and Behra were chasing furiously until the German spun into the sand and retired. Mieres then took up the challenge, passing Behra and closing the gap.

However, Musso was too far ahead and was even catching the Mercedes pair who were having to go at full pelt to keep ahead. It was only when he spun off and dropped back that they could relax slightly.

It was another impressive 1-2 for them, despite Moss sustaining a smoking engine late on in the race. Musso had given them a hard challenge and Fangio was the first to congratulate him on his podium finish.

<text>The 1955 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Aintree on 16 July 1955. It was race 6 of 7 in the 1955 World Championship of Drivers. British driver Stirling Moss led a Mercedes 1–2–3–4 domination of the race, to win his first Formula One race narrowly ahead of his illustrious Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Several people, including Moss, believed that the Argentine allowed his British protégé to claim his debut win in front of his home crowd. This was, however, at Moss&#x27; inquiry, consistently denied by Fangio, who claimed that Moss &quot;was simply faster that day.&quot;

In the wake of the Le Mans disaster, the French, German, Swiss and Spanish Grands Prix which were to take place at existing circuits had all been cancelled. The Aintree circuit was an all-new circuit around the Grand National horse racing course in Liverpool; it was built to be at the time one of the safest and most modern racing facilities in Europe.

With only one Championship round therefore remaining (the Italian Grand Prix some 2 months later), Fangio&#x27;s points advantage over Moss was sufficient to secure his third World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

This was the last all-Mercedes-powered podium until the 2014 Italian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1955 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, in Monza, Italy on 11 September 1955. It was the seventh and final race of the 1955 World Championship of Drivers.

In the wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster, the championship was still open after the British Grand Prix; although after that race (with the French Grand Prix already having been cancelled) the German, Swiss and Spanish Grands Prix were all cancelled. This meant that Fangio won the world driver&#x27;s championship for the 3rd time and the 2nd time in succession.

The Monza circuit near Milan had been revamped and resurfaced, and had been given all new pit and safety facilities. A new concrete banking had been constructed over where the original slightly banked version was, and the combined 10 km (6.214 mi) Monza circuit was used for the first time since 1933. The Curva Sud had also been modified from 2 right hand corners into one sweeping right-hander known as the &quot;Parabolica&quot;, where run-off area was implemented.

Of the 4 factory Mercedes cars in the race, Fangio and Moss drove the streamlined, closed-wheel W196&#x27;s, while Kling and Taruffi drove open-wheel W196&#x27;s. This was the 4th and last appearance of the streamlined Mercedes cars at a championship GP as well as the third and last time in Formula One history that a race had been won by a closed-wheel car.

This was the last Grand Prix race for 1950 world champion Nino Farina. This was also the last Grand Prix win for a Mercedes-Benz as an engine manufacturer until David Coulthard won the 1997 Australian Grand Prix and the last Grand Prix win for Mercedes-Benz as a constructor until Nico Rosberg won the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix, and also the last 1-2 finish for Mercedes-Benz as an engine manufacturer until Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard at the 1997 European Grand Prix, as well as the last 1-2 finish for Mercedes-Benz as a constructor until Lewis Hamilton and Rosberg at the 2014 Malaysian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1956 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 22 January 1956 at Buenos Aires. It was race 1 of 8 in the 1956 World Championship of Drivers. With the withdrawal of Mercedes from Formula One, Fangio and Moss would begin the season with new teams. Fangio would join Ferrari while Moss would lead the Maserati team. The grid in Argentina was composed entirely of Italian cars. Ferrari and Maserati showed up with five cars each. The other three cars were also Maseratis: two private entries and Hawthorn for the B.R.M. team.

Ferrari dominated practice and occupied the first three grid positions, with Fangio&#x27;s pole time 2.2 sec faster than second. Maserati dominated the early race with Menditeguy and Moss leading the field. Fangio was a non-factor with a faulty fuel pump. He took over Musso&#x27;s car after 30 laps and re-entered without losing Musso&#x27;s fifth place in the race. Meanwhile, Musso took over Fangio&#x27;s ailing car but did not manage to finish in it even a single lap. Fangio quickly passed Behra but lost his position after spinning. On laps 40–43, disaster struck the leaders. While third, Castellotti&#x27;s gearbox broke, Menditeguy left the lead with a broken driveshaft, and new leader Moss&#x27;s engine began to smoke. Fangio, who had overtaken Behra, passed the ailing Moss on lap 67, and finished unchallenged after Behra spun late in the race. The race was not without controversy when the Maserati team manager lodged a protest that Fangio was push-started after the earlier spin. The protest was ultimately rejected by both the stewards and the FIA.

<text>The 1956 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 13 May 1956 at Monaco. It was race 2 of 8 in the 1956 World Championship of Drivers.

The Owen&#x27;s BRM made their first appearance but after qualifying both cars were withdrawn due to engine valve problems. The other two non-starters were the too-slow Scarlatti and Chiron due to his engine blowing up in practice.

Moss, starting from the middle of the front row, took the lead at Gasworks on the first lap and led every lap. Fangio was not having a good day. He hit the straw bales on lap 2, causing Schell and Musso to retire when trying to avoid him, and on lap 32 he hit the harbour wall, bending a rear wheel. He turned the car over to Castellotti after the pit stop to fix the wheel. On lap 54 while second, Collins came in the pit and turned his car over to Fangio. He resumed in third and passed Behra for second on lap 70, but he was 47 seconds behind Moss. On lap 86 Perdisa&#x27;s brakes locked when being lapped by Moss, the resulting contact caused Moss&#x27;s bonnet to lift allowing Fangio to close the gap by two seconds each lap but Moss won with a 6-second cushion.

<text>Víkar (&quot;Old Norse nominative case form&quot; Víkarr; &quot;Latin&quot; Wicarus) was a legendary Norwegian king who found himself and his ships becalmed for a long period. To raise a wind, a human blood sacrifice was needed, and the lots fell on King Víkar himself. Starkad (&quot;Starkaðr&quot;), Víkar&#x27;s counselor urged a mock hanging from a tree instead, but in giving this advice Starkad had been prompted by the god Odin, who desired Víkar&#x27;s death. According to the account in &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, when Starkad let loose the branch, the apparent reed-stalk with which Starkad stabbed at the king was seen to be a real spear, the stump under Víkar&#x27;s feet fell away, and the calf guts which had been used instead of rope turned into a strong withy. Víkar died. Saxo Grammaticus in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 6) refers to a similar version relating a magic transformation, but prefers or invents a more rational account in which Starkad tied the osier very tightly so that Víkar could hardly breathe and then stabbed Víkar with his sword. This was the first of Starkad&#x27;s three great crimes.

==From &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
Saxo&#x27;s account is short, seemingly a summary. He claims that Odin had given Starkad three times the span of a mortal life in order to commit a proportionate number of crimes. But this follows on a 
discussion about Odin and Thor which interrupts his story and seems out of place. The discussion may have been inspired by a fuller account such as the version in &quot;Gautrek&#x27;s saga&quot; where Starkad&#x27;s fate is decided by an interchange of blessings and curses laid on Starkad by Odin and Thor alternately.

For Saxo, Vikar (&quot;Wicarus&quot;) is simply &quot;king of Norway&quot; rather than of king of Hördaland (modern Hordaland) or some other region within Norway. After Starkad&#x27;s destiny was laid on him, Starkad came to Vikar (perhaps for the first time) for the purpose of accomplishing Vikar&#x27;s death. Starkad lodged with King Víkar, and so was present on the raiding expedition where Vikar was becalmed for the greater part of a year.

==From &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;==
According to &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, Víkar was the son of a king of Agdir (&quot;Agðir&quot;) named Harald Agder-king (&quot;Haraldr inn egðski&quot;) whose ancestry is not given. After the death of Starkad&#x27;s father Stóvirk (&quot;Stórvirkr&quot;), young Starkad was brought up in Harald&#x27;s court along with Harald&#x27;s son Víkar. King Herthjóf (&quot;Herþjófr&quot;) of Hördaland made a surprise attack one night, slew Harald Agder-king and took his son Víkar hostage to ensure the behavior of Harald&#x27;s former subjects. This Herthjóf was son of King Hunthjóf (&quot;Hunþjófr&quot;) son of Fridthjóf the Bold (&quot;Friðþjófr inn frækna&quot;), the protagonist of &quot;Fridthjófs saga ins frækna&quot;.

But after some years Víkar gathered some champions to himself, including the young Starkad, made a surprise attack on Herthjóf&#x27;s hall, and slew King Herthjóf and thirty of his men. Víkar then became king of Agdir, Jadar (&quot;Jaðar&quot;, modern Jaederen in Hördaland), and Hardang (&quot;Harðangr&quot;, modern Hardanger) which Herthjóf had also ruled. The tale then tells of Víkar&#x27;s successful battle at Lake Vænir (Lake Vänern) against King Sísar (&quot;Sísarr&quot;, conjectured to refer to the Slavic title of цѣсарь/цьсарь) of Kiev, of Víkar&#x27;s defeat of Herthjóf&#x27;s brother King Geirthjóf (&quot;Geirþjófr&quot;) of the Uplands in a war in which Geirthjóf fell in the First Battle of Telemark, and how Víkar then took over not only the Uplands but also Telemark which belonged to Geirthjóf&#x27;s brother Fridthjóf who was not there at the time. When Fridthjóf returned and attacked, Víkar defeated him with the aid of King Óláf the Keen-eyed (&quot;Óláfr inn skyggni&quot;), king of Nærríki in Sweden (modern Närke). Fridthjóf agreed to a treaty by which his kingdom was turned over to Víkar but Fridthjóf kept his life and freedom. At the Second Battle of Telemark In all these battles Starkad was Víkar&#x27;s greatest warrior.

After all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to Hördaland with a large army, Víkar was becalmed. Divination showed Odin required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and Víkar&#x27;s lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair (&quot;Hrosshárs-Grani&quot;), Starkad&#x27;s foster father, took Stakad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be Odin. After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King Víkar in payment for Odin&#x27;s blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death.

==From &quot;Hálfs saga&quot;==
&quot;Hálfs saga og hálfsrekka&quot; provides a different King. Here Víkar is the son of King Alrek (&quot;Alrekr&quot;) of Hördaland with no mention of King Harald of Agdir or King Herthjóf of Hördaland. Alrek&#x27;s ancestry is not given in the saga, but according to the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; (genealogies&#x27; attached to &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;), Alrek was the son of Eirík the Eloquent (&quot;Eiríkr inn málspaki&quot;), son of Alrek, son of Eirík, son of Skjöld (&quot;Skǫldr&quot;) son of Skelfir, king of Vörs (&quot;Vǫrs&quot;), modern Voss in northern Hordaland. Skelfir was the ancestor of the Skilfings. See Scylfing for further details and comment.

Alrek dwelt at Alreksstead (&quot;Alreksstaðr&quot;, modern Alrekstad), presumably named after himself. Alrek had married Signý, daughter of an unnamed king of Vörs, but was urged by Koll (&quot;Kollr&quot;), one of his men, to also look at Geirhild (&quot;Geirhildr&quot;) daughter of Dríf (&quot;Drífr&quot;). Meanwhile, Odin came to Geirhild in the guise of a man named Hött (&quot;Hǫttr&quot; &#x27;hood&#x27;) and bargained with Geirhild that he would make her into Alrek&#x27;s wife if Geirhild agreed to call on Hött in all things. Geirhild accepted. When Alrek saw Geirhild, he took her as his second wife. But Signý and Geirhild quarreled to the point that Alrek decided to give up one of them and announced he would keep whoever had brewed the best beer when he returned from his raiding. Signý called on Freyja but Geirhild prayed to Hött, who appeared before her, spat into the beer, but said he would be back to take what was between herself and the beer vat in exchange, meaning the child of Alrek in Geirhild&#x27;s womb. When Alrek returned he judged Geirhild&#x27;s beer the best and so kept her as his wife, but said he that foresaw her son on a gallows, sacrificed to Odin.

The account then tells how Alrek was slain by King Jösur (&quot;Jǫsurr&quot;) of Rogaland in a war Alrek made against Koll of Kollsey. Alrek had died and Jösur had already departed before Alrek&#x27;s son Víkar arrived at the battlefield. But years later, when Jösur was again in Kollsey, King Víkar attacked Jösur and slew him along with all the farmers in the area, leaving only the women, whence the area was purportedly afterwards known as Kvennaherad (&quot;Kvennaherað&quot; &#x27;Women&#x27;s hundred&#x27;). War continued between King Víkar and King Jösur&#x27;s son Hjör (&quot;Hjǫrr&quot;) until at last they agreed to make peace. Since Hjör and his descendants are afterwards called kings of Hördaland.

At that point Víkar is out of the story which does not relate his death, being concerned instead with Hjör, his son Hjörleif (Hjǫleifr), and then Hjörleif&#x27;s son Hálf (&quot;Hálfr&quot;) who is the central figure in the saga.

==Descendants of Víkar==

===From &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;===
According to &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; Víkar had two sons named Harald and Neri. During his life, Víkar made Harald the King of Telemark and Neri Jarl of the Uplands. Upon Víkar&#x27;s death, the brothers came to an agreement by which Harald became King of Agdir and Hördaland and Neri became Jarl of Telemark and the Uplands.

===From &quot;Hálf&#x27;s saga&quot; and the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;===
According to &quot;Hálf&#x27;s saga&quot; and the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, Víkar had a son named Vatnar whom &quot;Hálfs saga&quot; says was buried in Vatnar&#x27;s Howe (&quot;Vatnarshaugr&quot;).

Vatnar fathered two sons.

&quot;Half&#x27;s saga&quot; names Vartnar&#x27;s sons as Snjall (&quot;Snjallr&quot;) and Hjall (&quot;Hjallr&quot;) whose bodies lay in the Brothers&#x27; Howe (&quot;Bræðrahaugr&quot;).

In the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; the two sons are instead named Ímald (&quot;Ímaldr&quot;) and Eirík, Eirík being the father of Gyda (&quot;Gyða&quot;) who married Harald Fairhair. This is the King Eirík of Hördaland who appears in the &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair&quot; in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

==Commentary==
There are resemblances between the variant back stories of Víkar found in &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; and &quot;Hálfs saga&quot;. In both Vikar&#x27;s father is slain in battle by another king and in both Víkar in turn attacked and slew that king some years later. An heir to that king then made war on Víkar, either a younger brother or a son. This war ends with a peace agreement.

That Víkar&#x27;s opponents and father and descendants are differently named may in part come from varying ideas of when Víkar lived. The accounts provide three contradictory synchronisms with the dynasty of Yngling kings in the Ynglinga saga.

&quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, in the material about Starkad, relates that after Víkar&#x27;s sacrificial death, which was Starkad&#x27;s first crime, Starkad took refuge in Sweden with the kings Alrek and Eirík. In the Ynglinga saga Starkad is mentioned in a single reference to Starkad&#x27;s third crime, the slaying of Áli the Bold (&quot;Áli inn frækni&quot;). Áli had usurped the Swedish throne from King Aun the Old, the great-grandson of King Alrek to whom Starkad fled. This is a good chronological match considering Starkad&#x27;s supposed lifespan of 300 years and that Aun was 60 years old when Áli usurped his throne. This tradition places Vikar and Starkad far back in the mists of time.

But in &quot;Hálfs saga&quot;, King Hjör who warred against Víkar is father of King Hjörleif, father of Hálf, father of Hjör, father of Geirmund Hellskin (&quot;Geirmundr heljarskinn&quot;) a contemporary of King Harald Fairhair who settled in Iceland, indicating roughly four generations from Vikar&#x27;s time to Harald Fairhair&#x27;s time. In the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, Víkar is father of Vatnar, father of Eirík, father of Gyda, wife of Harald Fairhair, indicating three generations from Víkar&#x27;s time to Harald Fairhair&#x27;s time. Generations are not exact chronological measurements, so a difference between four generations and three generations does not break the relative chronology. (See Gard Agdi for the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; traditions about Geirmund&#x27;s ancestors.)

In both accounts Víkar is king of Hördaland, though &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; connects Víkar primarily with Agdir. In the &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair&quot; and elsewhere, King Eirík, Víkar&#x27;s grandson in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, rules Hördaland. But other accounts appear to contradict this. The beginning of &quot;Grettis saga&quot; (&#x27;Saga of Grettir&#x27;) states that Hördaland was ruled by Geirmund Hellskin. The &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (2.19) instead tells that Geirmund had a dominion in Rogaland but also agrees with the later &quot;Hálfs saga&quot; that Geirmund was son of Hjör, son of Hálf, son of Hjörleif who was king of the Hjördalanders. &quot;Hálfs saga&quot; suggests an explanation. This saga first says that Alrek and his son Víkar ruled Hördaland but Hjörleif&#x27;s ancestors were kings of Rogaland. But after the peace agreement between Víkar and Hjör (and presumably after Víkar&#x27;s death), Hjörleif son of Hjör is called king of both Hördaland and Rogaland. The situation these account envisages appears to be the reign of two simultaneous lines of kings within Hördaland, perhaps historically true or perhaps arising from artificial conflation of different traditions—traditions perhaps of rulers who reigned over Hördaland at different times, if they ever reigned at all. Such a conflation would encourage the roles played by Geirthjóf and Fridthjóf to be assigned to Jösur and Hjör who in this chronology would become Víkar&#x27;s contemporaries.

The third chronological placement of Víkar and Starkad is intermediate between these two. The final parts of &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; make Neri son of Víkar a contemporary of Hrólf Kraki of Denmark. Hrólf Kraki of Denmark is noted for his interactions with King Adils (&quot;Aðils&quot;) of Sweden who in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; is sixth in descent from King Alrek of Sweden, the contemporary of Víkar in the Starkad section of &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;. The &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; therefore contains two contradictory synchronisms with the Yngling lineage. But about that time of Adils, reckoning by generations, is when the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; places King Gautrek. Some of the details in &quot;Hálfs saga&quot; also indicate this third synchronism. King Hjör who warred against Víkar is father of King Hjörleif, one of whose wives was the sister of Sölvi (&quot;Sǫlvi&quot;) the Viking who usurped the Swedish throne from King Eystein (&quot;Eysteinn&quot;) who was purportedly Adils&#x27; son and seventh in descent from King Alrek. The Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; may agree with this intermediate synchronism. In that poem, the first section occurs during the reign of King Hrothgar of Denmark, the uncle of Hrólf Kraki (called Hrothwulf in the poem). Beowulf foresees that Ingeld&#x27;s planned wedding to King Hrothgar&#x27;s daughter will be thwarted by an old warrior who will bring up details of past quarrels and wrongs between the Danes and Heathobards and fighting will result. In the account in book 6 of the Gesta Danorum&#x27;s, in a parallel story about Ingeldus, the part assigned in prophecy to the unnamed warrior is played by Starkad.

<text>The 40th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Wednesday, May 30, 1956. The event was part of the 1956 USAC National Championship Trail and was also race 3 of 8 in the 1956 World Championship of Drivers. The 1956 race was the first to be governed by the United States Automobile Club. The AAA withdrew from auto racing the previous August after a succession of incidents, including the Le Mans disaster and the fatal crash of Bill Vukovich during the 1955 race. Another change was made to the track that would have an immediate effect on the racing. The vast majority of the circuit was paved over in asphalt. A short stretch approximately 600 yards in length was left brick along the mainstretch. Speeds were expected to climb, and qualifying records were expected to be shattered during time trials.

The 1956 race is also known in Indy 500 lore as &quot;Cagle&#x27;s Miracle&quot;. Torrential rains pummeled the Speedway in the days leading up to the race. The track was full of standing water, access tunnels were completely flooded, and the infield was a muddy quagmire. The conditions threatened to postpone or outright cancel the race. Speedway superintendent Clarence Cagle supervised a massive cleanup effort, in which hundreds of thousands of gallons of water were pumped out of the tunnels and out of the infield. Cagle and his crew worked non-stop for 48 hours straight, some without sleep, and had the track ready just in time for race morning.

The race was slowed by a then-record eleven yellow caution light periods which totaled 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 15 seconds. The race was described by veteran sportswriters as &quot;a series of sprint races between yellow lights&quot;. Pat Flaherty led a total of 127 laps en route to victory; taking the lead for good on lap 76. Sam Hanks - the popular veteran still searching for his first &quot;500&quot; victory - came home second, just 20 seconds behind. Hanks charged during the second half, but the numerous cautions stymied his chances to catch up to much less pass Flaherty. No less than twelve cars were involved in crashes or spins, including Dick Rathmann, who took the checkered flag to finish 5th, only to wreck in turn 1 on his cool down lap. Blown tires were the culprit for several of the incidents.

==Time trials==
===Saturday May 19===
Pole Day attracted a record crowd of 125,000 spectators. With the new asphalt surface, new track records were expected. Pat Flaherty won the pole position with a new one-lap track record of 146.056 mph and a new four-lap track record of 145.596 mph. A total of ten drivers would qualify faster than the old track record from 1954. Jim Rathmann and Pat O&#x27;Connor rounded out the front row.

Two cars suffered spins, Bob Christie and Jack Turner. Neither drivers were injured, and both would ultimately make the field. Ed Elisian waved off twice before making the field on his third and final attempt. By the end of the day, the field was filled to 17 cars.

===Sunday May 20=== 
The second day of Time Trials was held on Sunday May 20. Twelve cars completed qualifying attempts, and the field was filled to 29 cars. Johnny Thomson (145.549 mph) was the fastest driver of the day. Thomson&#x27;s speed was the second-fastest in the entire field, just 0.08 seconds slower than polesitter Pat Flaherty&#x27;s time. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, there were only four spots left open in the grid.

===Saturday May 26=== 
The third day of Time Trials was scheduled for Saturday May 26. Rain washed out all track activity for the day.

===Sunday May 27===
The fourth and final day of Time Trials was scheduled for Sunday May 27. USAC officials announced Sunday morning that a minimum of two hours would be made available for qualifying. Eighteen cars lined up intending to make a qualifying attempt, however, rain persisted throughout the day. Six cars were able to take to the track, and five completed runs. The field was filled to 33 cars, with one car (Eddie Sachs) bumped. Eddie Johnson, the last car to make it out, completed his run in the rain.

One of the drivers not able to qualify was Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina. He was unable to get his Bardahl-Ferrari up to speed, and he did not make a qualifying attempt.

Qualifying had lasted only 57 minutes before more rains came. With 12 cars still waiting in line, USAC officials announced that they would extended qualifying beyond the 6 o&#x27;clock gun in order to allow those cars a chance. Around 7:30 p.m., the skies opened up, and any chance to continue qualifying before sunset was lost. After a late-night meeting, USAC announced that they would re-open qualifying on Monday morning at 8 a.m. The track would be available for exactly 63 minutes (to fulfill the two hours they promised on Sunday morning). Jean Marcenac, chief mechanic for the Novi team, threatened to withdraw the already-qualified car of Paul Russo in protest of the decision. He claimed that the officials miscalculated the time needed for all 12 cars to get a fair shot; and that his team&#x27;s other driver (Eddie Russo) had virtually no chance to make it to the front of the line.

The issue became moot as torrential rains flooded the Speedway during Sunday night and into Monday. The extra qualifying session was cancelled, and the field was set. On Carburetion Day (Tuesday May 29), rain had finally stopped, allowing a brief, 45-minute practice session. Meanwhile, parts of the facility were badly flooded, and the infield was a muddy quagmire. With the race scheduled for Wednesday, track superintendent Clarence Cagle oversaw a massive clean-up effort.

==Race summary==
===Start===

After torrential rains and flooding throughout the week, track crews had worked diligently for more than two days to clean up the grounds. Rumors of a postponement or an outright cancellation were unfounded. Showers fell overnight, but ceased by the time the gates opened at 5 a.m., and the facility was ready to go. Race day dawned sunny and the track was dry. Tony Hulman gave the command to start engines at 10:56 a.m., and the field pulled away behind the DeSoto pace car.

At the start, Jim Rathmann grabbed the lead going into turn one from the middle of the front row. Pole winner Pat Flaherty followed in second, and Pat O&#x27;Connor third. Down the backstretch, O&#x27;Connor moved into second, followed by Tony Bettenhausen. Flaherty slipped to fourth. Rathmann completed the first lap at a record speed of 138.867 mph. On lap 4, O&#x27;Connor took the lead in turn three. The race was already unfolding as ultra-competitive, as the top four to five cars were running close together on the track and jockeying for position. Jimmy Daywalt pulled into the pits with magneto failure. His crew went to work to get him back in the race. On lap 11, Paul Russo in the Novi machine now led, with O&#x27;Connor second, and Flaherty third. Russo set a blistering pace, averaging 142.255 mph for the first twenty laps (50 miles), a new race record. Russo also set the fastest lap of the race on lap 19 (144.416 mph).

===First half===
On lap 22, Paul Russo was still leading, but going into turn one, he violently blew a right rear tire. The car broke into a spin, and crashed into the outside wall. Russo was not seriously injured. He climbed from the car and ran to the infield grass. The remnants of the tire flew into the grandstands, and two spectators suffered minor injuries. The first yellow caution period of the day came out, with Pat O&#x27;Connor now in the lead. Under the caution, another crash occurred. Johnny Thomson lost control at the south end of the mainstretch, hitting the inside pit wall, and swerving out into the path of other cars. Johnnie Tolan, Keith Andrews, Sam Hanks and Troy Ruttman also became involved, with Ruttman spinning out and coming to a rest in the infield in turn one. The most serious injury was to a pit crew member, who suffered a broken leg when Thomson&#x27;s car careened towards the pits. The yellow light would stay on for over 15 minutes to clear the track and clean up an oil spill caused by the accident. Tolan, Hanks, and Andrews would continue, but Thomson and Ruttman were out of the race.

The green came back out on lap 31. Pat O&#x27;Connor led, with Pat Flaherty close behind. The two drivers swapped the lead multiple times over the next several laps. At the 40-lap mark (100 miles), the top five was Flaherty, O&#x27;Connor, Johnnie Parsons, Tony Bettenhausen, and Jim Rathmann. The second yellow came out when Ray Crawford spun at the north end of the mainstretch. After a series of pit stops by the leaders, Johnnie Parsons now led. Don Freeland moved into second, then took the lead when Parsons made his pit stop on lap 72.

Al Herman&#x27;s car locked up the rear wheels and crashed near the start/finish line on lap 75. It brought out the third yellow of the afternoon. Freeland and Bob Sweikert, running 1st-2nd, came into the pits during the yellow. Tony Bettenhausen suffered a small fire in the pits, but it was quickly extinguished and he was able to rejoin the race. When the green came back out on lap 88, Pat Flaherty was now in front.

Don Freeland did a spin in turn two on lap 96, but was able to drive the car back to the pits. The yellow light was on for about two laps. At the halfway point, Pat Flaherty led, with Sam Hanks second, and Bob Sweikert third. Andy Linden pulled into the pits with the car smoking, and he was forced to drop out with an oil leak.

===Second half===
Tire problems were befalling numerous drivers. Officials from Firestone believed that the high track temperature was responsible for the many tire failures. Lee Wallard, observing the race on the radio network, felt that the drivers were racing too hard and were wearing out their tires. He conjectured that some drivers were unwilling to pit for new tires because they did not want to give up valuable track position. Keith Andrews, as-such, reportedly blew a right-front tire, and spun on the mainstretch. He later dropped out with transmission failure.

Pat Flaherty continued to lead, with Bob Sweikert second, and Sam Hanks third. All three cars were on the lead lap. But on lap 130, Sweikert shredded a right-rear tire in turn two. He brushed the outside wall down the backstretch, but was able to limp back to the pit area on the rim. He lost a lot of time, but he was able to get back in the race. Under the ensuing yellow, Flaherty came in for a pit stop for fuel and the crew changed his right-rear tire. The stop lasted 37 seconds, and he came back out still holding the lead.

At the 150-lap mark (350 miles), Flaherty led with Freeland second, and Hanks third. Jimmy Daywalt crashed hard on the leader&#x27;s lap 149. A small fire broke out, and the car came to rest against the wall at the exit of turn two. With the field slowed once again under the yellow, Flaherty&#x27;s lead was about 30 seconds.

The green light came back out on lap 159, but it was short-lived. Tony Bettenhausen blew a right-rear tire and crashed in the south shortchute. The yellow would stay on for another seven minutes. After running in the top ten most of the day, Jim Rathmann&#x27;s car began smoking noticeably. After a number of laps off the pace, he pulled into the garage area on lap 176 with engine failure due to low oil pressure.

With the green back on for lap 166, Sam Hanks began to charge and started to cut into Flaherty&#x27;s lead. Hanks had trimmed the deficit to about 18 seconds when Eddie Russo (driving Ed Elisian&#x27;s car) stalled out on the track. The yellow light was on for two minutes.

===Finish===
With twenty laps to go, Flaherty continued to lead, with Hanks solidly in second, and Freeland third. Flaherty&#x27;s lead was back up to about 26 seconds. Running in fourth place with just 13 laps to go, Pat O&#x27;Connor dropped out with magneto failure. In the final ten laps, Hanks was unable to close the gap. Pat Flaherty took the checkered flag and won by a margin of 20.45 seconds over Sam Hanks. Don Freeland finished third, and Johnnie Parsons fourth. Dick Rathmann, (who had spun earlier), crossed the finish line to finish fifth, only to crash in turn one on his cool-down lap. Rathmann initially feared he still had one lap to go, but when scoring serials were checked and settled after the race, it was confirmed he had completed all 200 laps and officially placed 5th.

Flaherty, driving for the John Zink team, notably notched the first Indy 500 victory for the famous Watson roadster. In his 12th attempt, veteran Sam Hanks was still searching for his elusive first Indy victory. Flaherty was the last driver to win the &quot;500&quot; wearing a t-shirt. All subsequent winners have worn flame retardant uniforms. Flaherty also sported a green shamrock on his helmet, eschewing longtime Indy superstitions against using the color green. Flaherty claimed that shortly after he crossed the finish line, his throttle linkage broke, preventing him taking any extra &quot;insurance&quot; laps, as many drivers were known to do at the time.

==Broadcasting==
===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. The broadcast was carried by over 280 affiliates, as well as Armed Forces Radio. The broadcast came on-air at 10:45 a.m. local time, fifteen minutes prior to the start of the race. This was the final broadcast based out of the old wooden Pagoda, which was demolished after the race. Guests in the booth included senator William E. Jenner, L. Irving Woolson (DeSoto), L.L. &quot;Tex&quot; Colbert (Chrysler), and USAC competition director Duane Carter.

This was also the final year to have only two turn reporters (&quot;south turns&quot; and &quot;north turns&quot;). Beginning in 1957, the crew would be expanded to have one reporter in each of the four turns. Lee Wallard, the 1951 winner, joined the broadcast as guest commentator. Wallard visited the booth several times at periodic intervals to offer color commentary and observations.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1956 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 8 on the 1956 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Former World Champion Giuseppe Farina entered, but struggled to get his car up to speed, and he was unable to make a qualifying attempt. Race winner Pat Flaherty earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, Flaherty finished fifth in the final season standings, the highest of any Indianapolis 500 race winner throughout the 11 years the race was on the WDC calendar.

<text>The 1956 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 3 June 1956 at Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 4 of 8 in the 1956 World Championship of Drivers.

After the first day of practice on Thursday, Fangio was on pole with a time almost 5 sec faster than second place Moss. These times would not be touched with wet conditions on Friday and windy conditions on Saturday.

It was raining when the race began and Fangio made a poor start and settled in fifth with Moss well in the lead. But by lap 3 Fangio would be in second having passed Behra, Collins, and then Castellotti. By the fifth lap he was in the lead and had opened up an 8-second lead on Moss by lap 10 with Collins third on a drying track. Collins took second when Moss lost a back wheel on the climb after the Eau Rouge bridge. He was able to safely stop and sprint back to the pits and take over Perdisa&#x27;s car. He resumed in sixth but a lap down to the leaders. Collins took the lead for good when Fangio lost his transmission on lap 24. A tight battle for second between Behra and Frere ended when Behra&#x27;s engine began to misfire. This allowed Moss to move to third as he had passed Schell earlier. Moss ended the race on a furious pace but the two leaders were too far ahead to make up the gap.

This was the first Formula One podium for a Belgian driver.

<text>Christian Ferras (17 June 1933 – 14 September 1982) was a French violinist.

==Early years==
Ferras was born at Le Touquet in 1933. He began studying the violin with his father. He entered the Conservatoire de Nice as a student of Charles Bistesi in 1941, and in 1943 obtained the First Prize. In 1944 he went to the Conservatoire de Paris. In 1946 he won the First Prize in both disciplines (violin and chamber music), and started his performing career with the Pasdeloup Orchestra under Albert Wolff, and later Paul Paray. He worked with Romanian violinist and composer George Enescu, who also acted as an instructor.

The Violin Concerto by Federico Elizalde was premiered by Ginette Neveu in Paris in 1944, but Christian Ferras gave its London premiere under the direction of Gaston Poulet, in the presence of the composer, and made the world premiere recording on 7 November 1947, at the age of 14. In 1948 Ferras won First Prize at the international Scheveningen Festival; Yehudi Menuhin was among the judges. He premiered Arthur Honegger&#x27;s Sonata for Solo Violin in the Salle Gaveau on 16 November 1948. The next year, he won the second prize (the first prize was not awarded) in the international Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition. It was there that he met Pierre Barbizet, with whom he formed one of the most famous partnerships in the history of piano-violin collaboration. In 1950 he, along with Jean-Pierre Rampal and George Enescu, recorded various works by J.S. Bach. It was at this point that his career took off when he was invited by Karl Böhm to play with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1951. He subsequently gave a series of concerts in, amongst other places, Japan and South America.

==Later career==
In 1952, he premiered both Claude Pascal&#x27;s violin sonata, and (with Pierre Barbizet), he premiered Double Concerto by Ivan Semenoff. In 1954, he recorded Brahms&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Carl Schuricht. 1959 was a year in which Ferras rose to real prominence: he began his career in the United States by playing Brahms&#x27;s concerto under Charles Munch; recorded Bach&#x27;s Double Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin; played at the Prades Festival with Pablo Casals and Wilhelm Kempff; and premiered Gyula Bando&#x27;s Violin Concerto.

In 1960 he premiered Serge Nigg&#x27;s Concerto, which the composer is said to have written &quot;for the violin and not without the violin&quot;. In 1965 he enjoyed a much acclaimed tour through Southern Africa with accompanist Jean-Clause Ambrosini.
Ferras made many recordings with EMI, including
* Beethoven&#x27;s sonatas for violin and piano with Pierre Barbizet (1958)
* Berg&#x27;s Chamber Concerto and his Violin Concerto &#x27;To the Memory of an Angel&#x27;.
He went on in 1964 to record the Brahms Concerto with Herbert von Karajan for the Deutsche Grammophon label, and then the concertos of Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Bach, which are the recordings for which he is most admired. He continued to make recordings with Deutsche Grammophon: with Barbizet, the violin sonatas of Brahms, Schumann, Franck and Lekeu.

==Awards/honours==
Ferras&#x27;s 1965 Deutsche Grammophon recording of the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic won both the Grand Prix du Disque and Edison Prize. In 1975, he was awarded recognition by the Conservatoire de Paris for his works, and retired from regular public performance for health reasons. He returned to playing in Paris on 9 March 1982 with Alain Lefèvre and then on 6 May with Pierre Barbizet. He gave his last concert in Vichy on 25 August 1982.

==Death==
Christian Ferras struggled with severe lifelong depression. He committed suicide in Paris on 14 September 1982, aged 49.

==Pre-Hispanic antecedents of Ixtlahuacán del Río==
&quot;Ixtlahuacán&quot; is a word of Nahuatl origin; the name means &quot;flat place&quot;. It was founded by the Toltecs in approximately AD 610; it is hard to be certain of the exact date of founding, because none of the groups who inhabited the region — Tecuexes, Tepehuanes, Coanes, Cazcanos, and Zacatecos — had a written language in this period.

== Toponymy ==

Ixtlahuacán is a word of Nahuatl origin, it is the union of the words &quot; &quot;Ixtláhuatl&quot; &quot; (plains) and &quot; &quot;Can&quot; &quot; (place); therefore, it means: &quot; &quot;Place of Plains&quot; &quot;.

== History ==

It was founded by the Toltecs at the beginning of the 7th century when they passed through the region. Possibly he was first in Tlacotán where tribes settled Totonacas, Tepehuanes, and Coanes, the founders being the Tepehuanes, who stood out for their belligerence.

The conquerors that approached Tlacotán were continually harassed by the aborigines of Ixtlahuacán. The conquest was carried out by Nuño de Guzmán who arrived in Tlacotán in 1529. It seemed a strategic place to defend and dominate the entire Atemajac Valley. Fines of 1531 gave the name of Nueva Galicia to everything conquered by Nuño de Guzmán, who was appointed governor, founding Guadalajara in Nochistlán; after not having followed, ordering his transfer to Tlacotán in May 1533, giving him the name of Guadalajara; the foundation was not carried out until 1535 and in 1539 royal ID was received granting the coat of arms to the town (Tlacotán), being seat of Guadalajara from 1535 to 1540.

In 1825 it had a town hall and from that date until 1910 it belonged to the 1st canton of Guadalajara; in 1838, it had a category of town and in 1878 it is already mentioned as a municipality. They had the police stations of Tepac, Tlacotán and the Congregation of San Antonio. On February 28, 1894, the Tepac police station was abolished and the Congregation of San Antonio was erected as a police station; and in March 1912, the Tlacotán police station moved to Trejos, and in 1922 the police station was restored.

<text>The 1956 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 2 September 1956 at Monza. It was the eighth and final race of the 1956 World Championship of Drivers. Coming into the race, Juan Manuel Fangio had an eight-point lead over Ferrari teammate Peter Collins and Jean Behra, driving for Maserati.

Fangio retired with a broken steering arm, while Behra also had to pull out. Luigi Musso, also driving for Ferrari, was told to hand his car over to Fangio to ensure the Argentine&#x27;s third consecutive title but he refused. Brit Collins, with the opportunity for his first world championship, sportingly handed his car over to Fangio during a routine pit-stop. Fangio finished second, behind Stirling Moss, giving himself and Collins a share of the points for second place and ensuring his fourth title.

The race saw the World Championship debuts of Jo Bonnier (the first Swede to do so), Les Leston, and Wolfgang von Trips, and the final World Championship appearances for Hermano da Silva Ramos, Toulo de Graffenried, Robert Manzon, Piero Taruffi, and Luigi Villoresi. Ron Flockhart scored his first World Championship points and podium finish, and it was the first World Championship race led by Musso. With Collins having a share of second place, this was the first World Championship Grand Prix in which British drivers finished one-two-three.

<text>The 1957 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 13 January 1957 at the Buenos Aires circuit. It was race 1 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers.

== Race report ==
Juan Manuel Fangio had left Ferrari for Maserati to attempt to win a fifth world championship with the help of their much modified 250Fs. Even without him, Ferrari had one of the strongest driver lineups in history, with Mike Hawthorn moving from BRM to join Peter Collins, Luigi Musso and Eugenio Castellotti.

Since the British teams were not present, Stirling Moss — who had signed for Vanwall — was part of the Maserati line-up with Jean Behra as third driver.

Fangio and Behra raced away into the distance as the rest of the field floundered. Moss&#x27;s throttle linkage broke on the startline and he lost 10 laps having it fixed. The Ferraris were all suffering terribly with clutch problems, as both Collins and Musso burnt theirs out, while Hawthorn&#x27;s was slipping badly.

Both Collins and Wolfgang von Trips took over Cesare Perdisa&#x27;s Ferrari in an attempt to stop the Maseratis, but were powerless to stop them taking the first four places. Moss rejoined and set fastest lap on his way to 8th place.

<text>The 1957 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 19 May 1957 at Monaco. It was race 2 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers.

== Race report ==

Despite a hesitant start, Moss led away on the first lap from Collins, Fangio, and Hawthorn. On lap 4 coming out of the tunnel, there was mayhem. Moss went straight through the chicane, sending debris from the wrecked barrier crashing onto the circuit. Collins crashed through the quayside barriers trying to avoid it. Fangio and Brooks slowed to make their way through the carnage. Brooks&#x27; effort was for nought, being hit by Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s Ferrari, which lost a wheel. Fangio took the lead from Brooks&#x27; damaged car and held it to the chequered flag.

On lap 96, with nine laps to go, von Trips lost a certain third place when his engine blew up. Brabham inherited it, but he in turn lost the place when the engine in his Cooper T43-Climax cut out at Casino five laps from the end. He coasted to the harbour and pushed the car home for 6th place.

<text>The 41st International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, May 30, 1957. The event was part of the 1957 USAC National Championship Trail and it was the third race of the eight-race 1957 World Championship of Drivers.

Sam Hanks won the Indianapolis 500 in his thirteenth attempt, the most such by any 500 winner. He retired from competition at Indy in victory lane. Contrary to popular belief, Hanks did not completely retire from racing until the end of the year. He skipped the Race of Two Worlds when his entrant withdrew, but competed in USAC Stock Car events later in the year, winning the event at Trenton, and finished third in points championships for 1957.

Hanks received a record $103,844 purse, the first driver to win a $100,000 single-race payday. The total race purse was also a record, over $300,000 for the first time.

Hanks won the race in George Salih&#x27;s &quot;Lay-down Offy&quot;. The Offenhauser engine was mounted on its side and shifted off-center. This was done in order to lower the center of gravity, reduce frontal area, and counterbalance the body roll in the turns. The car that Hanks drove for the win in 1957 would win back-to-back Indy 500s, with Jimmy Bryan piloting the very same chassis to victory again in 1958.

==Track improvements==
For 1957, the Speedway introduced a new state-of-the-art pit lane and brand new Master Control Tower to house broadcasting as well as timing and scoring. For the first time, the pit area was separated from the mainstretch by an inside wall. The pit lane was paved in concrete (the mainstretch remained brick), while a grass strip went the length of the pit road to accommodate pit crew sign board men. Flagging duties would be done from a station on the grass strip at the start/finish line, and eventually a small wooden platform would be constructed for the flagman to stand atop. USAC officials also stationed themselves on the new grass parapet (which would be removed after the 1993 race when the parapet was narrowed and paved with concrete, and pit road become asphalt except for the pit boxes).

For the 1957 race, the field lined up in the pit area single-file, rather than the traditional eleven rows of three on the racing surface. On the pace lap, the field assembled into position, and was aligned for the green flag. By 1957, the field was now being taken around for two warm-up laps (one &quot;parade&quot; lap, and one &quot;pace&quot; lap), an increase over the single lap used previously. This single-file grid practice would eventually lead to confusion, and was utilized for only two years.

==Practice and time trials==
Time trials was scheduled for four days, but the second day was rained out. Rain affected practice days as well.

Giuseppe Farina was the only European driver on the entry list for the race, however, he did not attempt to qualify. Farina had difficulty getting his car up to speed, and had experienced handling problems. On May 15, his teammate Keith Andrews stepped into his car for a test run, but crashed. Down the frontstretch, Andrews began to slide, and when he attempted to correct, the car backed into the inside wall separating the pit area. Andrews was crushed to death between the cowl and the fuel tank, but no fire broke out. Farina withdrew after Andrews was killed, with no backup car to use.

===Saturday May 18 – Pole Day time trials===

Pat O&#x27;Connor qualified for the pole position. Showers delayed qualifying for nearly four hours, and at other points during the afternoon. A total of only nine cars completed runs.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s speed of 143.948 mph was not a track record. Troy Ruttman was on the track, and after a lap of over 144 mph, rain forced him to abort the attempt. He was able to get back out to the track, but had to settle for a speed of only 142.772 mph.

The first rookie to make the field was Elmer George, the husband of Mari Hulman George, and son-in-law of Speedway president Tony Hulman.

===Sunday May 19 – Second day time trials===

The second day scheduled for qualifying was rained out.

===Saturday May 25 – Third day time trials===

Paul Russo (144.817 mph) was the fastest driver of the day, in one of the Novi Specials. Russo was the fastest qualifier in the field, as his speed was faster than the pole position time from the previous weekend.

===Sunday May 26 – Fourth day time trials===

Rain and winds plagued the final day of time trials. Twenty three cars entered the day looking to fill the final 11 positions. A total of 43 attempts were made, with 9 cars bumped.

Tony Bettenhausen (142.439 mph) was the fastest driver of the day, driving one of the 500 hp Novi Specials. 
Bill Cheesbourg needed two cars to make the field. His first attempt was too slow. But late in the day, he got in Cliff Griffith&#x27;s car, and at a speed of 141.565 mph, bumped Johnnie Parsons from the lineup.

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. The broadcast was carried by 302 affiliates, including Latin America. It reached 46 states and DC. The broadcast came on-air at 10:45 a.m. local time, fifteen minutes prior to the start of the race. For the fifth years, the network featured announcers from the five major radio stations in Indianapolis (WISH, WIRE, WIBC, WFBM, and WISH). For 1957, the crew was expanded to eleven, with three new remote reporting locations. For the first time, there would be a reporter in each of the four turns, and a third pit reporter was added to help cover the recently lengthened pit lane. In addition, the booth announcers moved into the newly-constructed Master Control Tower along the frontstretch.

Charlie Brockman conducted the winner&#x27;s interview in victory lane.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1957 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 8 on the 1957 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. For the second year in a row, former World Champion Giuseppe Farina entered, but again struggled to get his car up to speed. He eventually withdrew after his teammate Keith Andrews was killed in a crash testing the car. Race winner Sam Hanks earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, Hanks finished eighth in the final season standings.

<doc id="1122155" wikidata="Q1481002" url="?curid=1122155" title="The Ritz Hotel, London">
<text>The Ritz London is a 5-star luxury hotel at 150 Piccadilly in London, England. A symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious and best known. The Ritz has become so associated with luxury and elegance that the word &quot;ritzy&quot; has entered the English language to denote something that is ostentatiously stylish, fancy, or fashionable.

The hotel was opened by Swiss hotelier César Ritz in 1906, eight years after he established the Hôtel Ritz Paris. It began to gain popularity towards the end of World War I, with politicians, socialites, writers and actors in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against the Ottoman Empire. Noël Coward was a notable diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s.

Owned by the Bracewell Smith family until 1976, David and Frederick Barclay purchased the hotel for £80 million in 1995. They spent eight years and £40 million restoring it to its former grandeur. In 2002, it became the first hotel to receive a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales for its banquet and catering services. In 2020, it was sold to a Qatari investor.

The Grade II listed building&#x27;s exterior is structurally and visually Franco-American in style, with little trace of English architecture, and it is heavily influenced by the architectural traditions of Paris. The facade is on the Piccadilly side, on the Arlington Street side, and on the Green Park side. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. The Ritz has 111 rooms and 25 suites.

The interior was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style. Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as &quot;one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture&quot; and compares it to a royal palace with its &quot;grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers&quot;.

The Ritz&#x27;s most widely known facility is The Palm Court, which hosts the famous &quot;Tea at the Ritz&quot;. It is an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting, with panelled mirrors in gilt-bronze frames. The hotel has six private dining rooms – the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its &quot;boiserie&quot;, and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House, which is temporarily closed from January 2023. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy to resemble the bar on the Orient Express.

==History==
===Construction and early history===
Swiss hotelier César Ritz, the former manager of the Savoy Hotel, opened the hotel on 25 May 1906. It was built on the site which had been the Old White Horse Cellar, which by 1805 was one of the best known coaching inns in England. The financial backers of the Ritz felt that they had secured one of the prime sites in London for their project. They began negotiations in 1901, and completed the transactions for the simultaneous purchase of the leasehold for the Walsingham House Hotel and the adjacent freehold estate of the Bath Hotel for £250,000 in 1902. Demolition of both of the hotels began in 1904.

The building is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during the Belle Époque to resemble a stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. Its architects were Charles Mewès, who had previously designed Ritz&#x27;s Hôtel Ritz Paris, and Arthur Davis, with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander. It was one of the earliest substantial steel frame structures in London, the Savoy Hotel extension of 1903-04 being the first in the capital. Many of the materials used in the construction of the hotel were US-made. The initial fees for suites ranged from 1½ guineas to 3½ guineas.

After opening, a long-running feud between the hotel and Lord Wimbourne, a steel magnate who lived next door at Wimbourne House, lasted for years in a dispute over land. A number of locals were also concerned about the building and the impact it would have on their health.

While the Ritz was still under construction, a series of events highlighted the need for another luxury hotel in London. A 3June 1905 &quot;Daily Mail&quot; news story reported it was both Derby Week and the height of the tourist season, making hotel accommodation almost impossible to find. The Savoy had to refuse reservations, while Buckingham Palace turned offices into makeshift hotel rooms for visitors. An estimated 2,500 more persons needing rooms were expected shortly with the coming visit of the King of Spain.

Though the opening of the Savoy had brought about a marked change in how hotels provided services to its guests, Ritz was determined that his London hotel would surpass its competitor in their delivery. The Ritz installed two large lead-lined tanks on its roof to provide a steady stream of hot and cold water. The hotel&#x27;s bathrooms were all spacious with each having its own heated towel bar. Every bedroom in the hotel was provided with its own working fireplace.

Ritz shunned free-standing wardrobes due to his fear of dust settling on them; instead he built cupboards into the rooms with doors matching the panelling. Ritz&#x27;s ideas of cleanliness and hygiene prompted him to originally have all bedrooms painted in white and all beds made of brass, not wood, for the same reasons. Anything new or potentially useful was available to the guests of the Ritz.

César Ritz&#x27;s health had declined after his 1902 collapse at the Carlton, but he was feeling well enough to assume an active role in the plans for the hotel&#x27;s opening dinner on 24 May 1906. Unlike the opening of the Paris Ritz, which had catered to society, most of those invited to the Ritz, London opening were members of the national and international press. Major British newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; were invited to the dinner along with newspapers which included the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Ritz&#x27;s guest list also included the engineer and architects of the structure along with key staff members of the new hotel and their wives.

The hotel was not immensely profitable in its opening years; smaller than many of the new hotels springing up in that period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented by many of the London elite who considered it vulgar. It took £3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, and the hotel lost over £50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of the manager Elles with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant.

The hotel also suffered a blow upon the death of King Edward in 1910, when 38 planned dinners and functions were cancelled, but began to prosper the following year, made fashionable by the Prince of Wales who regularly dined here. King Edward was particularly fond of the cakes made at the Ritz. The hotel would regularly send him a supply, but this was kept in confidence so as to not embarrass the King&#x27;s personal chef. Ritz retained control of much of the hotel&#x27;s operation for many years. He hired world-famous chef Auguste Escoffier to provide cuisine to match the opulence of the hotel&#x27;s decorations; he placed a special bell in the entryway by which the doorman could notify the staff of the impending arrival of royalty. By 1929 the hotel was still being praised for its architecture; Professor Charles Reilly wrote about the Ritz in &quot;Building&quot; magazine in 1929, calling it the &quot;finest modern structure&quot; in the street, with &quot;an elegance of general form&quot;.

===High society===

On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper&#x27;s future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined at the Ritz with the Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (née Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and later that day announced that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables at the Ritz Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly £50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at the Ritz in the spring of 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant.

In September 1917, a shell exploded in Green Park in close proximity to the Ritz, and according to Lord Ivor Churchill it broke all of the windows to adjacent Wimbourne House. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, organised by Sir Basil Zaharoff, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. The Duke of Marlborough recorded dining at the Ritz; &quot;I lunched at the Ritz. The whole social world goes there, prices being cheap. All women there from M. Paget to the latest tart.&quot; A November 1917 article in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; titled &quot;How they starve at the Ritz&quot; detailed the lavish meals on offer despite national food shortages. The story was extensively reprinted in leaflets and some historians believe that it pushed the government into introducing compulsory rationing.

When asked to summarise hotels in London in the early 1920s, Barbara Cartland remarked that &quot;The Ritz stood for stuffiness and standards, the Carlton was for businessman, the Savoy was rather fast, some other ones were frankly scandalous, and the Berkeley, where you could dance all night for ten shillings, was for the young&quot;. In 1921, Bonvin, the manager of the Ritz, died, and was replaced with J.S. Walters. Walters was a &quot;tireless salesman&quot; in promoting the hotel, especially in mainland Europe, and flaunted the hotel in the &quot;Tatler&quot; at a time when it was unpopular to do so. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma frequented the Ritz from his time as a Sub-Lieutenant onwards, and when his friend Charlie Chaplin arrived in London in September 1921 after a nine-year absence, great crowds gathered at Waterloo station and Chaplin had to be ushered to the hotel by some 40 policemen. He stayed in the first-floor Regal Suite and was photographed throwing carnations to his fans from the Arlington Street balcony.

The Ritz became popular with film stars and executives when staying in London, although the hotel has kept most of the names of many of its luminaries a secret in its records. Douglas Fairbanks was known though to frequent the Ritz in the 1920s, and director Alexander Korda&#x27;s talent scout held a table at the Ritz in the 1930s. Noël Coward, also a regular diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s, met with Michael Arlen in the restaurant in 1924 to discuss the urgent problem of generating the funding for his new play, &quot;The Vortex&quot;. Arlen gave Coward a cheque for $250 without question, and &quot;The Vortex&quot; would go on to be his first major success. Coward&#x27;s song, &quot;Children of the Ritz&quot;, which featured in the 1932 revue &quot;Words and Music&quot; was penned while Coward was lunching in the Ritz with Beverley Nichols. Numerous authors began to meet at the Ritz during the same period, and it began to creep into literature itself. In Michael Arlen&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Piracy&quot;, the hotel was described as a &quot;very stout and solid building in the manner of the old Bastille, originally conceived no doubt with a fearful eye on class prejudice&quot;, and R. Firbank had a running gag in his novels about there being &quot;fleas in the Ritz&quot;. Later, the hotel appears in Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;. The narrator Nicholas Jenkins meets poet Mark Members at the Ritz, and the golden nymph in the Palm Court of the hotel is mentioned. 

William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan, who succeeded Henry V Higgins as chairman of the Ritz upon his death in 1928, was especially keen on attracting American guests to the hotel. He was a close friend of the Earl of Carnavon and his American wife Catherine Wendell, and at times the couple were freely given the entire second floor of the hotel to accommodate guests. Upon the death of Lord Lurgan in 1937, Carnavon was told that he had to begin paying for his staying at the hotel, but was given a &quot;slight reduction for old time&#x27;s sake&quot;. Carnarvon later remarked: &quot;The Ritz has been my London home for over fifty years. I&#x27;m very fond of the place. Nobody knows it better&quot;. In 1931, the Aga Khan was involved with organising the Round Table Conference at the hotel, which was attended by Mahatma Gandhi and many others. On one occasion the Aga Khan took over the Palm Court to hold a meeting with his followers.

In the 1930s, Aletto became the restaurant manager of the Ritz, a &quot;popular and much-mimicked character&quot; according to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin. The future Edward VIII and his associates were often seen at the Ritz in the 1930s. In 1932 the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; observed the Prince performing on the dance floor: &quot;The Prince of Wales never misses an opportunity to raise the stand of his dancing... He danced three tangoes each of which lasted about thirty-five minutes!&quot; In 1934, Edward&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Kent, married Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark at the Ritz and scaffolding was put up in the garden for the celebration. The Queen Mother would also attend private parties at the Ritz during this period, as did King Boris of Bulgaria and Queen Marie of Romania. At one point, the Ritz hosted four reigning monarchs simultaneously: King Boris, King Farouk of Egypt, Spain&#x27;s King Alfonso and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. After the romance of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson became public knowledge, both parties could be found at separate tables near the restaurant&#x27;s door, in case a speedy exit was necessary.

The Ritz suffered from the effects of the General Strike of 1926, subsequently seeing competition from the likes of the Dorchester Hotel and Grosvenor House. The Great Depression brought a sharp decline in business to the hotel, and in the summer of 1931 staff wages were reduced—the chefs, kitchen workers and the directors had a 25% cut in their wages. To increase earnings, in 1935 Fred Cavendish-Bentinck recommended that the hotel commence putting on a Cabaret show. Advertised in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, the programme was an immediate success. In January 1936, Austrian comedian Vic Oliver was one of the entertainers hired to perform at the hotel for two weeks, and Cyril Fletcher appeared in the show for a month the following year. The BBC began broadcasting live performances from the restaurant of the hotel, with pianist Billy Milton and others. It was through the show that the Irving Berlin song &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; grew in popularity, performed by Joe Kaye&#x27;s Dance Band. In 1937, James Stephens shortly succeeded Lurgan as director of the Ritz before being replaced by Hans Pfyffer von Altishofen, who had been on the board of the Ritz Hotel Development Company from 1910 and was also the chairman of the Paris Ritz.

===World War II===
During World War II, the Ritz became integral to political and social life among the elite, and a number of eminent royals, aristocrats and politicians moved into the hotel. Camilla Russell, the wife of writer Christopher Sykes, stated that the Ritz &quot;enjoyed a tremendous vogue during the war and was, even more than ever, much used as a meeting place&quot;, and at night was &quot;crowded yet somehow safe&quot;. Angela, Countess of Antrim, Syke&#x27;s sister, remarked that the Ritz was the ideal meeting place for &quot;gathering news of husbands at the wars&quot;. Emerald Cunard took up residence in the Ritz for a period, but later moved to the Dorchester. In the summer of 1940, the Albanian royal family, including King Zog I, Queen Geraldine of Albania, Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, the King&#x27;s six sisters, two nieces, three nephews and others moved into the hotel and were given their own floor, escorted by a chamberlain, the Albanian diplomats from Paris, and numerous bodyguards. Zog brought the royal gold and jewels with him, which were kept in the storeroom of the Ritz before being deposited in the Bank of England.

Due to Zog&#x27;s concerns about safety during air raids, the ladies&#x27; cloakroom was converted into a private shelter for the Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in the Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor&#x27;s house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.

Edvard Beneš would entertain guests at a private luncheon at the hotel several times a week during the war years. In 1942, Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle met in the Marie Antoinette suite of the hotel to discuss operations, Brendan Bracken, who served as an observer and mouthpiece on political society in London, and Anglo-American politician Ronald Tree spent much time at the Ritz, and Tree lived there during the winter of 1940. Laura Long, who would later become Laura Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, the second wife of John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough, the architectural writer James Lees-Milne, Harold Acton and writer Norman Douglas were regular diners at the Ritz during wartime.

According to Alastair Forbes and Felix Hope-Nicholson, during World War II, the basement bar at the Ritz was reserved for gay and lesbian guests, while the one upstairs was for heterosexual guests. Hope Nicholson described it as &quot;notoriously queer&quot;, and stated that &quot;the Ritz bar became too chic, too popular and above all, too queer for the authorities&quot;. Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, MP Harold Nicolson, Brian Howard, and Pauline Tennant were all regulars at the basement bar.

===Post-war years===
The hotel was owned for some thirty years by the Bracewell-Smith family, who also had significant stakes in the nearby Park Lane Hotel. Although the family were quick to earn a profit from the hotel, there was a turbulent period in the years after World War II, with a workers strike in 1946, and the restaurant attracting significant criticism in its quality of cuisine. On one occasion, a group of patrons of the Ritz, known as the &quot;Friends of the Ritz&quot;, met with Sir Bracewell Smith in Park Lane Hotel to complain about the standards; Smith himself dined at the Ritz and informed them that it was quite satisfactory.

Several suicides also darkened the reputation of the Ritz in the postwar years, including that of horse trainer Peter Beatty from the sixth-floor window in October 1949, and that of French gangster Baron Pierre de Laitre, who strangled love interest Eileen Hill to death in his second-floor room in March 1953 when she refused to marry him, before killing himself by stuffing a silk sock down his throat.

Nonetheless, the Ritz continued to be a social hub for the aristocracy and attract the world&#x27;s elite in the 1950s. It was very popular with the wealthy family of the Aga Khan, and oil magnate J. Paul Getty, reputedly the richest man in the world at the time, lived at the Ritz after the war. On one occasion a photographer working for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines staged an incident outside the hotel by arranging for the barrowboy to pour coppers onto the pavement as Getty emerged from the hotel and photographed just as he went to pick them up. Shell Oil heiress Olga Deterding lived at hotel for several years, and in one altercation with her lover she threw his trousers out of the window. In 1956 she tired of the high life and spent a period working at Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s leper colony in French Equatorial Africa. Film stars Rita Hayworth and Tallulah Bankhead were regular guests at the hotel; Hayworth was married to Prince Aly Khan between 1949 and 1953. Another notable resident of the Ritz during this period was Nubar Gulbenkian, an &quot;expansive extrovert&quot; who kept a permanent suite at the Ritz and made exorbitant demands for luxuries and foods, even if out of season.

In January 1959, Patrice Lumumba, the Prime Minister of Congo, stayed at the hotel and met with Sir Edward Adjaye, the Ghanaian High Commissioner in London and others in the restaurant. The event was picketed by Mosleyites, who in concern with human rights issues in Congo at the time, demonstrated outside of the hotel, displaying banners such as &quot;RAPERS OF CHILDREN – GO HOME&quot; and issuing racial epithets. Adjaye was attacked as he left the hotel, although it has been speculated that he was mistaken for Lumumba.

George Criticos served as head porter of the Ritz for 45 years, retiring in 1960 for health reasons; he had been recommended for a job at the Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff. In his 1959 book, &quot;George of the Ritz&quot;, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance. When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel, he called out to the man to stop him. When the man turned to face Criticos, he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria, who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train.

===Later history===

The social scene changed dramatically in London in the 1960s, with Beatlemania and the sexual revolution, and British aristocracy in the capital was not what it had been. 
By this time the general impeccable standards of the Ritz had fallen. Peregrine Worsthorne noted the change: &quot;Precisely that it was not all Ritzy, in the sense of being conspicuously luxurious...the glitter had long since faded and shabbiness set in. The place was usually empty, kept alive by memories of former glories and a clientele who preferred nostalgia to comfort&quot;.
Yet celebrities often held parties at the hotel, and the Rolling Stones were guests for many years. British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and Harold Macmillan often lunched at the Ritz; Heath would always reserve table 29 in the restaurant.

In the 1970s, the hotel fell into a turbulent period. Terrorist threats from the Provisional Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75 million. At the time of the sale, the hotel&#x27;s occupancy rate was just 45 per cent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times.

In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances, which had been popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Due to high demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval, and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.

In October 1995, David and Frederick Barclay of The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for £80 million from Trafalgar House, through their company Ellerman Investments. They spent eight years and £40 million restoring the hotel to its former grandeur, with the help of Parisian interior designer Philippe-Charles Belloir. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles made their first public appearance together at the Ritz, as they left a birthday party for Parker-Bowles&#x27; sister. The couple returned to the hotel in November 2002 for the Prince&#x27;s birthday party, which was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. In 2002, the Ritz became the first hotel to receive the Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales for banqueting and catering services.

In 2005, the Ritz acquired the adjoining Wimbourne House. On 27 January 2007, around 300 people were evacuated to the nearby May Fair Hotel following a fire alarm in the hotel. No one was hurt in the blaze, which started in the basement casino kitchen&#x27;s extraction vents. The Ritz casino only suffered &quot;minor damage&quot;. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was convalescing at the Ritz when she died following a stroke on 8 April 2013.

There was criticism in 2012 because the Ritz had not paid any corporation tax since being taken over by the Barclay twins. The accounts indicated that the profitable hotel used a series of tax reliefs to reduce its corporation tax to zero. David Barclay&#x27;s son, Aidan, stated that the company abided by UK law.

In March 2020, the hotel was sold to Abdulhadi Mana Al-Hajri, a Qatari businessman. He is the brother of Al-Anoud Al-Hajri, second wife of the current Emir of Qatar.

==Architecture==

Authors Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin describe the Ritz as &quot;the product of one of those near miraculous convergences of civilised patron and architects and craftsmen of genius working together in complete harmony both with each other and with the social and architectural fashions of the day. The building has been regarded as a masterpiece from the day it was finished...&quot; 
Both of the architects, Charles Mewès and Arthur J. Davis, were educated at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and the education which they received is clear in the design of the buildings, particularly the Renaissance influence, delivering &quot;an authentic fabric of traditional French classicism&quot;. Mewès had previously designed the Hotel Ritz of Paris for Cesar in 1897–8, after which he met Arthur Davis, and began working together preparing designs for the Grand Petit Palais in the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Both architects worked on the plans for the London Ritz in 1904–5.

According to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin the exterior is both structurally and visually Franco-American in influence with little trace of English architecture. For them the exterior &quot;represents an evocative confluence of various Parisian architectural traditions&quot;; the Piccadilly arcade echoes the arcaded ground floor in the Place Vendrome and the Rue de Rivoli, the steep mansarded skyline on the Green Park facade echoes Hector Lefuel&#x27;s work on the Pavillon de Flore of the Louvre, while the tall windows and wall panels of the facades resemble those of Mewès&#x27;s earlier work on a smaller building made as a home for Jules Ferry on Rue Bayard.

Excavation for the hotel began by contractors Waring White Building Co. Ltd in June 1904, and it was completed by 1 October 1905, and opened the following May. The building progress was documented each month by &quot;The Builder&#x27;s Journal and Architectural Engineer&quot;, and in one edition noted the difficulties of some of the aspects of construction such as hoisting 20-ton steel joists in a narrow building site. &quot;The Architect and Contract Reporter&quot; noted that the limited space did not allow for the storage of materials on site. All mortar had to be mixed in the basement and the stone was dressed &quot;on a platform with a watertight roof over the footway&quot;. The red-brick foundations of the earlier Walsingham House had to be blasted away to facilitate the foundations of the steel structure in concrete.

The total estimated cost was £345,227. 8s. 1d., with £102,000 going to Messrs Waring and Gillow, £49,000 to French decorators and over £15,000 to the English decorators. John P. Bishop and the Swedish-born Sven Bylander were consultant engineers during the building phase.

The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly , on the Arlington Street side, and on the Green Park side. The irregularity of the site presented initial problems for the builders. Davis dealt with this by &quot;brilliant perspective effects&quot; according to Binney, using curving walls to &quot;cleverly conceal the rapidly diminishing space at the back of the hotel&quot;. The purpose of the arcaded front was to provide more space for the bedrooms above. Expensive Norwegian granite is the material on ground floor, with Portland stone above it.

The steel frame of the building was made in Germany and is based on a model made in the early 1880s in Chicago to increase fire resistance. It was erected by Messrs Potts &amp; Co. of Oxford Street. Fireproofing of the walls were conducted by the Columbian Fireproofing Company Ltd. of Pittsburgh and London, with steel-ribbed bars allowing for ventilation, while remaining sound proof and free from vibration. The internal walls consist of &quot;hollow, porous, terra-cotta blocks&quot; covered with plaster, and the hotel&#x27;s flooring was also made fireproof. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel.

===Interior===
The hotel was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, which is consistent throughout, giving the hotel its &quot;special atmosphere of perfect appropriateness and elegant restraint&quot;. Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as &quot;one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture&quot; and compares it to a royal palace with its &quot;grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers&quot;. Waring &amp; Gallow were responsible for many of the fine design work of the interiors The ground floor plan dated to 1906 illustrated a large main restaurant overlooking the terrace and garden, a large central Grand Gallery and Winter Garden, a circular vestibule beyond the reception room, the Marie Antoinette Suite near the restaurant, and numerous shops.

The Grill Room had its own entrance on the right side of the entrance doors on Piccadilly, with a staircase leading down. The Grill Room was on the eastern side, and the Banqueting Hall lay at the western end, beneath the restaurant. Today this is home to the Ritz Club. A wide vaulted corridor, the Long Gallery, runs from the Arlington Street entrance on the east side to the restaurant on the west side, with finely woven Savonnerie carpets. Along it are several intricate horseshoe archways. A triangular-shaped staircase features in the building&#x27;s southwest corner. The curving main staircase was built to allow women to make a &quot;dramatic entrance and show off their gowns to best effect&quot;.

====The Palm Court====

The Ritz&#x27;s most widely known facility is the Palm Court, an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting. It is decorated with lavish furnishings, including gilded Louis XVI armchairs with oval backs, which the architects had designed based on research into French neo-classical furniture design of the 1760s and 1770s, which were made by Waring and Gillow. The room, with its, &quot;panelled mirrors of bevelled glass in gilt bronze frames&quot; and &quot;high coving ornamented with gilded trellis-work&quot;, according to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin &quot;epitomizes the elegantly frivolous comfort of Edwardian high life&quot;.

There were originally large windows at either end of the court, then known as the Winter Garden, and were replaced with twenty panels of mirrors after 1972. The fountain of the court, known as &quot;La Source&quot;, is made of Echaillon marble and is extravagantly sculpted. A nymph, gold in colour, is featured in a lair. A wrought-iron and glass roof of the Palm Court contains two gilded wrought-iron lanterns, and the ceiling contains lion skin motifs. The room is done in soft apricot and has remained so since 1906. César Ritz chose the colour to flatter the complexions of women after weeks of experimentation with various hues.

The Palm Court is the setting for the world-famous institution that is &quot;Tea at the Ritz&quot;, once frequented by King Edward VII, Sir Winston Churchill, Judy Garland, Evelyn Waugh and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. It acquired its reputation as &quot;&quot;the&quot; place for tea&quot; in London after World War I. In the 1920s a small orchestra would play regularly on the court; film producer John Sutro for instance recalled that Hermione Baddeley once requested the violinist to &quot;play something &quot;hot&quot;&quot;. Between the Winter Garden and the central Grand Gallery is a screen featuring two Ionic columns.

====Dining====
The hotel has six private dining rooms, the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its &quot;boiserie&quot;, and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House, which is temporarily closed from January 2023. Marcus Binney states that the restaurant is &quot;not only one of the most beautiful interiors in London, it can be claimed as the most beautiful restaurant in the world&quot;.

César Ritz once commented that the room was so heavily designed in bronze that it was fortunate that the hotel was built from steel, or the &quot;walls would collapse with the weight of all that bronze&quot;. Flanking the entrance to the main restaurant are two life-sized figures set in &quot;bronze vert after Clodion, holding gilded bronze lustres with six lights each, mounted on pedestals of polished Echaillon marble ornamented with bronze&quot;. The restaurant and adjacent guest room were designed by P. H. Remon and Sons of Paris. The ceiling is a described by Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin as a &quot;painted &quot;trompe-l&#x27;oeil&quot; ceiling on which pinkish clouds drift across the blue sky encircled by a garlanded balustrade&quot;. Bronze chandeliers are also a feature, influenced by an 18th-century Augustin de Saint-Aubin engraving known as &quot;Le Bal Pare et Masque&quot;, and &quot;Le Festin&quot; by Moreau le Jeune, which was given by the City of Paris to the King and Queen on 21 January 1782.

On the northern end against the Piccadilly arcade are floor-to-ceiling mirrors, divided into panes, which give the room a spacious effect, especially when the lights are on all day during the winter. At the south end of the restaurant is a watercolour by Davis and gilded figures known as &quot;The Thames and the Ocean&quot;, with a buffet made from Norwegian pink marble below it, believed to be inspired by Louis Seize&#x27;s &quot;Buffet of Mansart&quot;.

During the 1977 major renovation of the hotel, the scaffolding used in the project was hidden by a clean cloth during mealtimes in the Louis XVI restaurant so as not to upset diners with a possibly disturbing sight. During the renovation, the columns in the hotel&#x27;s lobbies were stripped of many coats of cream-coloured paint to display their original pink marble. Most of the work done in the renovation was done to restore and clean while keeping the original 1906 colour scheme. Much of the furniture from the original opening was still in use; new items were faithful copies styled after the originals. The hotel retained its nightstand call buttons for maid, waiter, valet and servant, refusing to make its patrons dial a telephone for services.

From its inception, the kitchen was run mainly by French chefs, and it had a specialist in Russian soups and Viennese pastry; its cakes became so famous that King Edward made regular orders from Buckingham Palace. M. Malley, who had been &quot;saucier&quot; at the Paris Ritz was appointed Chef des Cuisines, and invented dishes such as &quot;Saumon Marquise de Sevignre&quot; (Salmon with a crayfish mousse), &quot;Filet de Sole Romanoff&quot; (served with mussels, small slices of apple and artichokes), and &quot;Poulet en Chaudfroid&quot; (chicken accompanied by a curry-flavoured pinkish mousse) at the hotel.

The Ritz is renowned for its supreme catering service, as well as using its fine rooms for conferencing between executives and directors of multi-national firms. A table at the restaurant still needs to be booked weeks in advance. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to look like a bar on the Orient Express. The lounge was decorated by Marcel Boulanger in the Louis VIV style, the clubroom was by Lenygon and Morant, who were influenced by the Palladian design of Cumberland House in Brettingham, and other rooms were decorated with clear William Chambers and Robert Adam influences. Meals can be served on Nanking china in the Trafalgar Suite. The banquet and catering services received a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales in 2005.

The Ritz Restaurant was awarded one Michelin star in the 2016 Michelin Guide and received its second star in the 2025 guide.

====Marie Antoinette Suite ====
The Marie Antoinette Suite is accessed from the main restaurant and is temporarily closed from January 2023. According to Marcus Binney &quot;the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice&quot;. Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with &quot;flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes&quot;.

In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with &quot;drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons&quot;. The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on &quot;cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels&quot;. The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, in contrast to the window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by &quot;clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding&quot;, according to Binney.

====Rooms and suites====
The Ritz London has 136 guestrooms, of which 111 are bedrooms and 25 are suites. The main bedrooms are divided into three principal categories: Superior Queen/King/Twin, Executive King/Twin and Deluxe King/Twin. The Superior Queen and King rooms are and in size respectively, while the Executive and Deluxe king rooms are and The suites are divided into the categories: Junior Suite, Executive Suite, Deluxe Suite, and also include the Signature Suites: The Trafalgar Suite and The Green Park Suite, each with their own unique style. The Executive Suites typically face south, and are in size, with a small lounge area and antique furniture. The Junior Suites, with &quot;fireplaces, gilded mouldings and antique furniture&quot; are above Piccadilly, and are in size, while the 3-5 bedroom suites range in size from to .

====William Kent House====
William Kent House, also known as Wimbourne House, was opened as an extension of The Ritz and is temporarily closed from January 2023. The house has been converted into a complete function area with the Music Room, the Burlington Room, the Queen Elizabeth Room and the William Kent room. It also accommodates three of the Ritz&#x27; top suites: The Arlington Suite, the Royal Suite as well as the Prince of Wales Suite.
Several of the rooms have Louis XVI chimneypieces. The Grade II building was carefully restored and given a modern touch with period furnishings concealing things like flat screen televisions. The interior design was entrusted to interior designer Philippe-Charles Belloir, who also worked for several years on the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The restoration won a Royal Institute of British Architects national gold medal in 2007.

===The Ritz Club===

The Ritz Club was a casino in the basement of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill. In the original structure, this was where the Ritz ballroom was located. A May 1906 edition of &quot;Truth&quot; magazine described the basement with the Grill Room and Banqueting Hall as palatial, ivory-white in decor, with &quot;mirrors on all the walls reflecting an endless intersection of arched ceilings&quot;. The rooms were used for dinners, balls and theatrical shows, with a stage at the south end of the Banqueting Hall. By the mid-1920s the Grill Room had been relocated into the Banqueting Hall, and furnished with circular tables with oval back wicker chairs. One 1926 brochure stated that it was the scene of &quot;some of the finest private and public balls ever given in London&quot;.

During World War II it became known as the nightclub &quot;La Popote&quot;. The interior of the club was made to simulate a combat dugout complete with sandbags. The club&#x27;s chandeliers were made out of various types of empty liquor bottles with candles in their necks for light. The dance floor was crowded during wartime, but it later declined in popularity. Laurie Ross was in charge of the Ritz Bar and Grill for many years. The bar, known to its regulars as &quot;Laurie&#x27;s Bar&quot;, closed when Ross retired in 1976. By the 1970s the basement rooms were closed to the public.

In 1977, Trafalgar House agreed to lease the basement to Mecca Sportsman and Pleasurama, and the Ritz Club was opened the following year, under separate management from the hotel. The basement was restored in the hotel&#x27;s Louis XVI style of 1906, and the decorations included 6,000 sheets of gold leaf. Gold leaf was not spared on moldings, cupids and garlands and a blue sky with fluffy clouds painted on the ceiling above the gaming tables. The restoration consisted of repainting, cleaning and recovering all in the original color scheme. Furniture was restored to its original state and replicas replaced what could not be restored. Stephen Pulman was appointed Head Chef, after being recruited from the exclusive London members&#x27; club and restaurant Annabel&#x27;s. When it opened, the Ritz Club was open to members and hotel guests only. However, unlike most casinos, it charges a fee to enter. The games are considered &quot;high stakes&quot; in that the minimum bet is usually very high. They offer roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines.

In 1998, the club was purchased by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James&#x27;s Street to the basement of the Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After a quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. In 2006, The Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In 2022, The Ritz Club hosted afternoon tea in the hotel&#x27;s original ballroom. This is now closed.

==In popular culture==
Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1942 novel &quot;Work Suspended&quot; features a scene at the Ritz in which the narrator falls in love with a friend&#x27;s wife during a luncheon. Alan Bennett&#x27;s allegorical play, &quot;Forty Years On&quot; was later set in the basement of the Ritz during the war. In the universe of the book &quot;Good Omens&quot;, two primary characters, the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley, often frequent the Ritz. The hotel is mentioned in the song &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; (&quot;There were angels dining at the Ritz&quot;) as well as in Queen&#x27;s &quot;Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;.

The hotel is the source of the word &quot;ritz&quot; and the expression &quot;to put on the Ritz&quot; (meaning to act or dress in an opulent, extravagant matter), the latter of which inspired the Irving Berlin song &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;. Large portions of the 1999 romantic comedy &quot;Notting Hill&quot; were filmed in and around the hotel. In the worldwide disaster depicted in the Science Fiction novel &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; by Jerry Pournelle, there is a reference to the Ritz Hotel being destroyed when London is flooded by ocean waters.

==Controversy==

In recent years the Ritz has taken measures to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, even though they had been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz changed its name to the Banqueting &amp; Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.
===Allegation of discrimination===
In April 2023, The Ritz faced a discrimination controversy when a job applicant, Jerelle Jules, was told that &quot;Afro-style&quot; hair was banned among staff at the exclusive London hotel. Jules received the hotel&#x27;s employee grooming policy after reaching the final interview stage for a dining reservations supervisor position. He declined the final interview, stating that the policy, which dated back to 2021, was an example of &quot;corporate ignorance&quot; and &quot;institutional racism.&quot;

The Ritz issued an apology, stating that an out-of-date and incorrect grooming policy was mistakenly sent to Jules and reiterated that they did not condone discrimination of any form. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, described the hair policy as &quot;blatant discrimination&quot; and criticised The Ritz&#x27;s response as inadequate. Jules invited The Ritz to discuss diversity and inclusivity in their recruitment process.

<text>The 1957 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 4 August 1957 at Nürburgring. It was race 6 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers. The 22 lap race was won by Juan Manuel Fangio, and is often cited as one of the greatest victories in racing history. It was Fangio&#x27;s fourth victory out of the seven races in the season contested by Formula 1 cars - excluding the Indianapolis 500, in which only US drivers competed, using USAC Championship cars. Furthermore, due to the number of points he had accumulated in the season (34 to Luigi Musso&#x27;s 16), his victory at the Nürburgring mathematically clinched Fangio&#x27;s fifth World Championship title with two races to go. The race was also notable for being Fangio&#x27;s 24th and last victory in F1; his career still stands as having the highest win percentage ever, with 46.15% of his 52 race entries being wins.

== Report ==

Fangio had taken notice of the tyre and fuel-level selection of the Ferrari drivers, and realized they were probably going to run the entire race without a pit stop. Fangio decided he would use softer tyres, and only a half tank of fuel. This would allow the car to take corners faster, but also require a pit stop. Fangio took his pit stop on lap 13, in first place, and 30 seconds ahead of Hawthorn and Collins.
The pit stop was a disaster; the mechanic removing the rear left wheel let the wheel nut roll under the car without noticing, and finding it took nearly half a minute. Fangio left the pit lane in third place, and 48 seconds behind Collins who was in second place. But in his Maserati 250F he began to mount a charge. Over the next 10 laps, Fangio broke and rebroke the lap record 9 times (7 of the records were in successive laps) and he took 15.5 seconds off Hawthorn&#x27;s lead in the first lap, then another 8.5 seconds in the next lap. Early in the 21st lap, Fangio went on the inside of the left corner at the ESSO Terrasse taking second place from Collins. Late in the 21st lap, during a left corner, Fangio cut past Hawthorn on the inside of the corner, with only his right tyres on the track and his left tyres on the grass. This probably took place at the left-right combination before the Breidscheid bridge, as Fangio said it was at a 90° left followed by an also tight right just before Breidscheid and Hawthorn recollected being overtaken at a right turning bend. Fangio probably overtook Hawthorn in the left turn and then closed the door going to the right turn, thus boxing Hawthorn in. Fangio maintained his lead, but not easily, as Hawthorn fought back, nearly overtaking Fangio at a few corners, but to no avail, and Fangio won the race with about 3 seconds of a lead.

After the race, Fangio commented, &quot;I have never driven that quickly before in my life and I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to do it again&quot;. Later on, Fangio was also quoted as saying:
&quot;Nürburgring was my favourite track. I fell totally in love with it and I believe that on that day in 1957 I finally managed to master it. It was as if I had screwed all the secrets out of it and got to know it once and for all... For two days I couldn&#x27;t sleep, still making those leaps in the dark on those curves where I had never before had the courage to push things so far.&quot;

To increase participation, the organizers opened the field to Formula 2 cars. The two races were run at the same time but the Formula 2 entries (shown in yellow) were not eligible for World Championship points and some sources do not consider these starts in career stats.

<text>The 1957 Pescara Grand Prix was a one-off Formula One motor race, held on 18 August 1957, at the Pescara Circuit near Pescara in Italy. The race was the 7th round of the 1957 World Championship of Drivers. The circuit is the longest to ever hold a world championship race in Formula One. The race was the first and only Formula One World Championship race to take place at the track. It was also the first of two consecutive Italian races, which meant that it was the first time that the same country had held two Formula One World Championship races in the same season.

== Background ==
The Grand Prix was contested by 16 drivers and three official constructors, with Luigi Musso entered unofficially due to Ferrari withdrawing with safety concerns. The constructors were Maserati, Vanwall and Cooper-Climax. Juan Manuel Fangio led the championship with 34 points, ahead of Luigi Musso on 16 points and Mike Hawthorn on 13 points. Tony Brooks was in 4th with 10 points, and Sam Hanks, Stirling Moss and Peter Collins were all 5th with 8 points. Fangio had won four races and had clinched the title at the 6th round, the German Grand Prix. Both Musso and Hawthorn finished in the top three for two races. Maserati had a strong start to the season, outshining Ferrari in both the race and qualifying on multiple occasions. Fangio had a strong start to the season, winning the first two rounds. Moss, however, had a poor start to the season. He struggled with reliability issues such as a broken throttle linkage at Argentina and became ill just before the French Grand Prix.

The Grand Prix was the first and only World Championship race to take place at Pescara. The circuit hosted its last event in 1961, after which it was closed due to safety concerns. The track was long, the longest circuit to ever host a Formula One World Championship round.

The event took place at short notice due to the sudden cancellation of the Belgian and Dutch Grands Prix over disputes regarding fees. The organisers had offered the constructors reduced appearance fees, which they rejected. Due to the large size of the circuit, no attempt was made to require an entry ticket. Many spectators watched the race from houses around the track. Around 200,000 spectators were estimated to have been in attendance.

=== Safety concerns ===
Pending the investigation for the deaths of 13 people at Mille Miglia earlier that year, Enzo Ferrari stated that Ferrari would not compete in the race. However, he did enter a single Ferrari 801 after he received insistent requests from Luigi Musso, though he stated that this did not constitute an official Ferrari entry into the race.

Despite a ban on all motor races on public roads following the disaster, the race was given special permission by the Italian Government to go ahead. The track was modified to conform with new safety regulations introduced after the accident. A chicane was added at the end of the seafront straight.

== Practice and qualifying ==
There were no official Practice sessions. However, due to the circuit being a road course, many drivers drove observation laps in road cars two days before the race. Qualifying consisted of two sessions which were held on the Saturday before the Sunday race-from 07:00 to 09:30 and 16:30 to 18:30 local time. Between the two sessions, the straw bales were removed and the road was opened up again to the public. At the end of the sessions, Fangio set the quickest lap time of a 9:44.6 which gave him pole position. He set an average lap speed of , which unofficially beat the previous lap record of because it was set during qualifying. Moss was second with a 9:54.7 and Musso was third with a 10:00.0.

=== Qualifying ===
== Race ==
Two hours before the race start, Fangio complained of pains in his right shoulder. However, he still competed in the race.

The race took place from 09:30 local time in dry and very hot weather.

A unique incident occurred when Jack Brabham&#x27;s F2 Cooper was running short of fuel far from the pits and he pulled into a roadside petrol station and topped up.

<text>The 1958 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 19 January 1958 at Autodromo Municipal Ciudad de Buenos Aires Circuit. It was race 1 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the sixth Argentine Grand Prix. It was held on the #2 variation of the circuit. The race was held over 80 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 313 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss in Rob Walker&#x27;s privately entered Cooper T43. Apart from being the first World Drivers Championship race win for Cooper as a constructor it was also the first win for a rear-engined car, the first win for a car entered by a privateer team and the first win for a car powered by an engine built by another manufacturer. Moss took his seventh Grand Prix victory by 2.7 seconds over Italian driver Luigi Musso (Ferrari 246 F1). Musso&#x27;s British teammate Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari 246 F1) was third.

==Report==
A change in fuel regulations meant that the British teams Vanwall and BRM would not be ready for the Argentine race held in mid-January, four months ahead of the second race of the season in Monaco. This meant that this race had the fewest entries (10) of any Grand Prix in the history of the F1 World Championship. Vanwall released Moss to compete with another team and he linked up with the Rob Walker Racing Team to drive their Cooper T43, a car about to be superseded at the factory Cooper team by the new T45.

With the race set to be held in very hot conditions the race was shortened from 400 kilometres to 313. The shorter race led the Walker team to consider running the race without stopping for tyres. The car&#x27;s four stud wheels would take almost two laps to complete a tyre change, much slower than their Ferrari and Maserati rivals. Moss and his team began a deception, complaining about the tyre situation and how much time they would lose changing tyres.

Jean Behra in a privateer Maserati 250F led at the start but was quickly passed by Hawthorn. By lap ten Juan Manuel Fangio had taken the lead in the Scuderia Sud Americana entered Maserati 250F and Moss had worked his way forward into second position as the pitstops began for the heavier Italian built cars.

After the pitstops Moss led from Musso and Hawthorn. Behra was delayed by a spin and Fangio by a misfire. With ten laps remaining the others decided Moss was not going to pit and Musso and Hawthorn picked up the pace. Moss&#x27; tyres were disintegrating but there was enough with careful driving that Moss limped to the line for a remarkable victory. Behind the two Ferraris Fangio was the first Maserati to finish with Behra, two laps down, scoring the remaining points. Harry Schell was next ahead of Fangio&#x27;s teammate Carlos Menditeguy, both Maserati 250F mounted. Peter Collins was the only retirement of the ten entries having stopped on the opening lap with a broken axle in the third Ferrari.

It was the first victory for a rear-engined car but for the moment it would be an aberration brought on by tactics. It was not yet obvious that the death of the front-engined car was just a year away.

<text>The 1958 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 18 May 1958 at Monaco. It was race 2 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 2 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the 16th Monaco Grand Prix and was held over 100 laps of the three kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 314 kilometres.

The race was won by French driver Maurice Trintignant in the second and final Grand Prix victory of his long career. The win was the second consecutive victory for the privateer Rob Walker Racing Team. Trintignant took the teams newly acquired Cooper T45 to a twenty-second victory over Italian driver Luigi Musso driving a Ferrari 246 F1 with Musso&#x27;s British teammate Peter Collins (Ferrari 246 F1) was third.

Trintignant&#x27;s win put the superiority of front-engined cars in doubt. Musso&#x27;s second place put him into a four-point championship lead over Moss and Trintignant.

== Race report ==
Vanwall and BRM returned after their Argentine absence and so Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Harry Schell all went back to their regular drives. In Moss&#x27;s place at the Rob Walker Racing Team with the new 2000 cc engined Cooper T45 was French driver Maurice Trintignant. The race winning Cooper T43 could not even qualify for the small 16-car Monaco grid, Ron Flockhart was first reserve for the race.

Missing from the field was the previous year&#x27;s winner and reigning World Champion, Juan Manuel Fangio who did not have a full-season drive. Fangio himself was in America, preparing for an ultimately disappointing Indianapolis 500 campaign with the Dayton-Walther team. Future Formula One impresario Bernie Ecclestone entered two Connaught B-Types to be driven by Bruce Kessler and Paul Emery. Neither could qualify complaining of handling problems so Bernie Ecclestone tested one of the cars to see if he could help identify the cause, but he couldn&#x27;t. This has given rise to the widely circulated story that he attempted unsuccessfully to qualify. Also failing to make the grid were Maria Teresa de Filippis, the first female driver to enter a World Championship Grand Prix, and 58-year-old Louis Chiron in his final appearance at a Grand Prix. The Monaco local had won the Grand Prix 27 years earlier but Chiron and his Maserati 250F did not make it past qualifying.

Tony Brooks took pole position in his Vanwall VW 5 but Behra won the start. He led until his brakes failed in his BRM P25, and Mike Hawthorn swept by in the Ferrari 246 F1. Moss (Vanwall VW 5) had been duelling with him throughout the race until he retired on lap 38, and Hawthorn followed suit on lap 47 with a broken fuel pump. Graham Hill (Lotus 12) retired from fourth place in his first race on lap 69, after briefly leading. Vanwall pair Brooks and Stuart Lewis-Evans retired, leaving Trintignant to lead home the Ferraris by some 20 seconds giving Rob Walker his second race win of the year. Behind the Ferraris of Luigi Musso and Peter Collins was Jack Brabham in the factory Cooper T45, although three laps down and still looking a long way from becoming the next years champion. Schell in his BRM P25 was a further six laps behind Brabham picking up the final points after Wolfgang von Trips had an engine failure in the closing stages in his Ferrari 246 F1. The only other car still circulating was the second Lotus 12 of Cliff Allison, 13 laps behind Trintignant.

Trintignant&#x27;s win disproved the belief that rear-engined Cooper victory achieved by Stirling Moss in Argentina was a one-off freak circumstance win, and the smaller British cars would be treated more seriously, although ultimately a Cooper would not win again until 1959. The Rob Walker Racing Teams pair of early 1958 victories would remain the best ever performance by a privateer team until the rise of Tyrrell Racing in the late 1960s.

<text>The 42nd International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday, May 30, 1958. The event was part of the 1958 USAC National Championship Trail, and was also race 4 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers.

The race is best known for a massive first-lap, 15-car pileup that resulted in the death of fan-favorite driver Pat O&#x27;Connor.

Jimmy Bryan was the race winner. This marked the first time that one car would carry two drivers to separate wins at the race, in back-to-back years, with Sam Hanks winning the previous year&#x27;s race in the same car.

The race featured young rookie A. J. Foyt&#x27;s debut at Indy. On lap 148, he spun in an oil slick, blew out the tires, and dropped out of the race.

Juan Manuel Fangio arrived at Indy under much fanfare as he attempted to qualify for the Indy 500 and score points towards the World Championship. He practiced early in the month, but withdrew when he could not get up to speed.

==Time trials==
Time trials were scheduled for four days.

*Saturday May 17 – Pole Day time trials
**Ed Elisian set a new one-lap track record of 146.508 mph to sit tentatively on the pole position. His four-lap average stood at 145.926 mph. Later in the day, Dick Rathmann qualified at 145.974 mph to win the pole position. Rathmann was not able to beat Elisian&#x27;s single-lap record, but his four-lap record eclipsed Elisian overall by a mere 0.08 seconds.
*Sunday May 18 – Second day time trials

==Race summary==

===Opening lap crash – Death of Pat O&#x27;Connor===
For the second year in a row, the starting grid was assembled single-file in the pit lane. The cars were instructed to pull away and assemble into the official eleven rows of three after they entered the racing surface. Confusion occurred on the pace lap, however, as the three drivers of the front row (Dick Rathmann, Ed Elisian, and Jimmy Reece) pulled away, and inadvertently escaped the pace car. The three cars were alone, and rather than wait for the grid to catch up, they rushed around to catch up to the back of the field. Sam Hanks pulled the pace car off the track and into the pits, but chief starter Bill Vanderwater displayed the yellow flag to wave off the start. An extra pace lap was allowed, and the front row re-took their position at the front of the pack. By the time Hanks was ready to pull the pace car back out on the track, the field had re-formed, and Vanderwater gave them the green flag.

At the start, Dick Rathmann took the lead in turn 1, Ed Elisian was second, and Jimmy Reece third. As the cars battled into turn three, Elisian spun and took Rathmann to the outside wall, triggering a huge 15-car pileup. Reece braked and was hit from behind by Pat O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s car sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down and burst into flames. Several other cars spun to the wall and into the infield. Jerry Unser touched wheels with Paul Goldsmith, and flipped over the outside wall. Unser suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Although O&#x27;Connor was incinerated in the accident, medical officials said that he was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull.

===First half===
Jimmy Bryan escaped the opening lap crash, and came around to lead the first lap. Eddie Sachs and Tony Bettenhausen also got by unscathed, to run second and third. Due to the crash, the yellow light stayed on for 25 minutes (approximately 18 laps). Four of the top five starting positions were out of the race from the crash, including polesitter Dick Rathmann, who placed 27th.

After a lengthy cleanup, the green flag came back out around lap 19. Bryan, Sachs, Bettenhausen, and rookie George Amick all traded time in the lead. There were 14 lead changes in the first half.

The second yellow came out on lap 38 when Chuck Weyant crashed in turn 4.

Eddie Sachs, a contender in the first quarter of the race, dropped out on lap 68 with transmission trouble.

===Second half===
The second half of the race settled down to a battle between Jimmy Bryan and Johnny Boyd, with rookie George Amick also in contention. Boyd lost the lead during a pit stop on lap 126. Bryan&#x27;s team had faster pit stops (three stops for 1 minute and 31 seconds), which allowed him to hold the lead.

Rookie A. J. Foyt spun out on lap 149. He hit an oil slick in turn one and went sideways, blowing out all four tires. The car did not make contact with the wall, but the engine stalled and Foyt was out of the race. He placed 16th.

With 25 laps to go, Boyd was running about one second behind Bryan, with Amick (a lap down in third place) running between them. Boyd suddenly slowed on lap 177 with a worn out right rear tire, sending him to the pits, and elevating Amick to second. Bryan led the final 75 laps (139 total) en route to victory. Bryan was victorious in the same car in which Sam Hanks won the 500 a year earlier. Amick stayed within striking distance of Bryan for the last part of the race, but Amick&#x27;s crew chief decided to accept a safe second-place rather than risk pushing their rookie driver into a mistake.

During the race as the news of Pat O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death spread around the track, the mood among the spectators became somber and glum. Reportedly, some in attendance left the grounds upon hearing the news of the fatality, some never to return.

==Aftermath==
Widely blamed for the accident, Ed Elisian was suspended by USAC for the accident (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by many in the racing community.

Following the accident, race officials announced that they would change the starting procedure, abandoning the single-file trip down pit lane that was used in 1957 and 1958. Also, for the 1959 Indy 500, metal roll bars welded to the frame behind the driver&#x27;s head were mandated, and helmets were required to pass safety certification by Speedway medical officials.

*Fastest Lead Lap: Tony Bettenhausen – 1:02.370 (144.300 mph)
*Pat O&#x27;Connor had appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in the week leading up to the race. His subsequent death is considered an early example of the perceived &quot;Sports Illustrated cover jinx.&quot;
* Only Appearance: George Amick (killed in 1959 USAC 100-mile race at Daytona)
* First Appearance: A. J. Foyt (First 4-time Indianapolis 500 winner.)

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. The broadcast reached 302 affiliates across all 48 states, as well as Armed Forces Network and Voice of America. For the final time, a 15-minute pre-race was used. The following year, the pre-race would be expanded to 30 minutes. The broadcast featured the debut of longtime fixture Lou Palmer, who reported from the normally quiet and remote third turn. As a rookie on the network, he was assigned turn three because &#x27;nothing ever happens there&#x27;. However, on the opening lap, Palmer was quickly thrust into duty, as his first words on the network were to describe the massive 15-car pileup and fatal accident of Pat O&#x27;Connor.

Among the guests that visited the booth was Pete DePaolo.

In 2019, this entire race&#x27;s radio broadcast became available as a paid digital download from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway website.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1958 Indianapolis 500 was round 4 of 11 on the 1958 World Championship. The event, however, attracted little interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit, particularly since it was held only four days after the Dutch Grand Prix. Juan Manuel Fangio entered with much fanfare, but withdrew when he was unable to get his car up to speed. Race winner Jimmy Bryan earned 8 points towards the World Championship. He finished 13th in the final season standings.

<text>The 1958 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 15 June 1958 at Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 5 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 4 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the 19th Belgian Grand Prix and it was held over 24 laps of the 14 kilometre circuit for a race distance of 339 kilometres.

==Summary==
The Belgian Grand Prix returned to the calendar after being off the calendar the previous year, and the 8.7 mile Spa circuit had been slightly modified. The pits had been rebuilt, the pit straight had been widened and straightened and the entire track had been resurfaced. The race distance had been shortened from 36 to 24 laps.

The race was won by British driver Tony Brooks in a Vanwall. It was Brooks first solo Grand Prix victory after his car won the 1957 British Grand Prix in a shared drive with Stirling Moss. Brooks finished 20 seconds ahead of fellow Briton Mike Hawthorn driving a Ferrari 246 F1. Brooks&#x27; Vanwall teammate Stuart Lewis-Evans finished third in a career-best finish, the first of just two podium finishes to his short Grand Prix career. The race also marked the first World Championship race start (and finish) by a woman in the form of Maria Teresa de Filippis, who had entered the Monaco Grand Prix earlier in the year but failed to qualify. She finished tenth in her privately-entered Maserati 250F, two laps behind Brooks&#x27; Vanwall.

On the last lap, Brooks came out of La Source to end the race, and his gearbox seized as he crossed the line. When Mike Hawthorn was coming out of the same corner to end his race in second, his engine failed as he was coming to the finish line. Stuart Lewis-Evans&#x27;s suspension collapsed on the way into La Source, and he crawled to the line in third. This race also marked the first points finish for Lotus when Cliff Allison came across the line in fourth.

<text>The 1958 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 6 July 1958. It was race 6 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 5 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The race was won by Mike Hawthorn driving a Ferrari 246 F1; it was his first Formula One victory since the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix and would prove to be his last. It was also the last Formula One race for five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio. On the final lap, Hawthorn eased up to let Fangio, running fifth at the time, finish on the lead lap of his last race. This turned out to be a blessing, as Peter Collins crashed on the final lap, allowing Fangio to secure fourth.

The race was marred by Ferrari driver Luigi Musso&#x27;s fatal accident at the Courbe du Calvaire. His car hurtled off course and crashed into a ditch. Musso was thrown out of the car, was critically injured and died later that day at a hospital near the track.

Of the 21 starters, six died in racing cars within the next three years. Musso died in the race itself, while Peter Collins died in that year&#x27;s German Grand Prix, Lewis-Evans at the Moroccan Grand Prix, Jean Behra in a support race for the 1959 German Grand Prix, Harry Schell in practice for the 1960 BRDC International Trophy, and Wolfgang von Trips and a dozen spectators died at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1958 German Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on 3 August 1958 at Nürburgring. It was race 8 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 7 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

To increase participation, the organizers opened the field to Formula 2 cars. Also, the race distance was shortened to 15 laps from 22 previously. The two races were run at the same time but the Formula 2 entries (shown in yellow) were not eligible for World Championship points and some sources do not consider these starts in career stats. Peter Collins died after an accident on the 11th lap, as rival Tony Brooks went on to victory. On lap 11 during the race while Collins was pushing his Ferrari to the limit chasing Tony Brooks&#x27; Vanwall in the Pflanzgarten section, Collins had a fatal accident as his Ferrari ran too wide, crashed into a ditch and went flying into the air. His car then somersaulted and he struck a tree head first. Although he was given medical treatment he died in hospital later that day. Brooks said in his biography that Collins drove harder than any other driver he had ever faced in his racing career. But others believed he had almost suffered the same incident as Luigi Musso did at the 1958 French Grand Prix earlier that season and that this race had the rivalry that was similar to the Collins and Fangio duel 2 years before.

Mike Hawthorn was initially disqualified for restarting his car against the direction of the circuit, losing seven points. However, Championship rival Stirling Moss had seen the incident which caused the disqualification and went to the judges to revert the decision since he felt Hawthorn had done nothing wrong. Eventually, Hawthorn was classified and retained his seven points.

<text>The 1959 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Monaco on 10 May 1959. It was race 1 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was also the 17th Monaco Grand Prix. The race was held over 100 laps of the three kilometre circuit for a race distance of 315 kilometres.

The race was won by Australian racer Jack Brabham driving a Cooper T51 for the factory Cooper Car Company team. It was the first win for Brabham, a future three-time world champion. It was the first World Championship Grand Prix victory by an Australian driver. It was also the first win for the factory Cooper team. Coopers had won races previously in the hands of Rob Walker Racing Team. Brabham finished 20 seconds ahead of British driver Tony Brooks driving a Ferrari 246. A lap down in third was the Cooper T51 of French driver and 1958 Monaco Grand Prix winner Maurice Trintignant of the Rob Walker Racing Team. André Testut was the last Monégasque driver to compete in their home race, since Louis Chiron retired from motorsports the year prior, until Olivier Beretta in 1994.

<text>The 43rd International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1959. The event was part of the 1959 USAC National Championship Trail and was also race 2 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers.

Rodger Ward earned the first of two career Indy 500 victories. A record sixteen cars completed the full 500 miles.

All cars were required to have roll bars for the first time.

==Practice and time trials==
Two drivers, Jerry Unser and Bob Cortner, were killed in separate crashes during the month. On May 2, Unser lost control in Turn Four, spun, and flipped down the main stretch. The car caught fire and Unser suffered significant burns; he died from complications of his burns on May 17. On May 19, rookie Cortner crashed in turn three after being pushed by a wind gust. He was killed instantly of head injuries.

On the morning of pole day, Tony Bettenhausen suffered a bad crash during a practice run. His car hit the outside wall and flipped over the inside guardrail. Bettenhausen escaped the crash with only minor injuries, and would qualify on the second weekend of time trials.

After three years of retirement, Duane Carter returned to the cockpit, and qualified for his ninth Indianapolis 500 start.

Time trials were scheduled for four days:
*Saturday May 16 – Pole Day time trials
*Sunday May 17 – Second day time trials
*Saturday May 23 – Third day time trials
*Sunday May 24 – Fourth day time trials

===Race statistics===



==Race notes ==
*Fastest lead lap: Johnny Thomson – 1:01.89
*Two drivers, Jerry Unser and Bob Cortner, were killed as a result of accidents during practice for this race.
*Bobby Grim qualified 5th and won the Rookie of the Year award despite dropping out of the race before the halfway point. On lap 85, he suffered magneto failure, and began coasting to the pits. As was customary for drivers of the time, he raised his arm to signify to the other drivers he had lost power. However, due to the high speed he was still traveling, he dislocated his arm in the process. Visibly in pain, the crew thought he was coming in for relief, and quickly Jack Turner jumped behind the wheel, but the car would not run.
*The first scoring pylon, a famous landmark of the Speedway, was constructed at the south end of the pit area.
*Last year&#x27;s winner Jimmy Bryan using the same exact car that won the race in 1957 and 1958 fell out of the race being left on the grid with a clutch failure to finish last (33rd).
*Final Indianapolis 500 start for 1956 winner Pat Flaherty. He crashed out after completing 162 laps, finishing 19th.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1959 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 9 on the 1959 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit, particularly since it was held only one day prior to the Dutch Grand Prix. Race winner Rodger Ward earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Ward also competed in the U.S. Grand Prix at Sebring. He finished tenth in the final season standings.

==Broadcasting==
===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. Fred Agabashian joined the crew for the first time as &quot;driver expert.&quot; The broadcast reached 385 affiliates, including Fairbanks, Alaska.

<text>The 1959 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on 31 May 1959. It was the ninth Dutch Grand Prix. The race was held over 75 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a race distance of 314 kilometres. It was race 3 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 2 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The race was won by Swedish driver Joakim Bonnier driving a BRM P25. It would be the only World Championship victory of Bonnier&#x27;s fifteen-year Grand Prix career. It was the first pole position and also the first win for the Owen Racing Organisation, the race team of the constructor BRM, and also the first pole position and win for a BRM-engine, after almost a decade of effort. Bonnier won by fifteen seconds over Australian driver Jack Brabham driving a Cooper T51, to become the first Swedish driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. Brabham&#x27;s American teammate Masten Gregory was the only other driver to finish on the lead lap in his Cooper T51 in third position.

Brabham&#x27;s second position expanded his championship points lead with Bonnier now second along with the Indianapolis 500 winner Rodger Ward.

The organisers wanted to have a local driver in the race, so Carel Godin de Beaufort was allowed to compete despite his car being a Porsche RSK sports car.

<text>The 1959 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 5 July 1959. It was race 4 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 3 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 37th French Grand Prix and the twelfth to be held at the Reims highway circuit and the fourth to be held on the longer and faster 8.348 km layout. The race was held over 50 laps of the eight kilometre circuit for a race distance of 417 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Tony Brooks driving a Ferrari 246 F1. Brooks dominated the race, leading all 50 laps and winning by 27 seconds over his American Scuderia Ferrari teammate Phil Hill. Brooks said after the race a sticking throttle in the closing laps made it more difficult than the result seemed. Australian driver Jack Brabham was over a minute behind in third position driving a Cooper T51 for the factory Cooper racing team after stopping to get new goggles as the circuit broke up.

Race day was very hot, to the point where the bitumen started to melt. Race cars were dislodging aggregate stones as the race went on causing American Masten Gregory to retire with cuts to his face, and Graham Hill to retire his Lotus 16 after his radiator was holed.

Stirling Moss was disqualified from eighth position after receiving a push-start in his British Racing Partnership entered BRM P25. Moss had pushed his car hard trying to overcome a failing gearbox, claiming a new lap record. Jean Behra too pushed hard in his Ferrari 246 F1, climbing into third racing against no less than four teammates at this race. Behra&#x27;s engine broke under his charge and the Frenchman had a heated discussion with team manager Romolo Tavoni which ended with Behra punching Tavoni. It would be Behra&#x27;s last race for Ferrari, with the Frenchman being fired for the assault.

The win was the first of the season for Scuderia Ferrari and moved Brooks into second place overall, five points behind Brabham. Hill&#x27;s second position moved him into third in the championship.

<text>The 1959 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Aintree Circuit on 18 July 1959. It was race 5 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 4 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 14th British Grand Prix and the third to be held at the Aintree Motor Racing Circuit, a circuit mapped out in the grounds of the Aintree Racecourse horse racing venue. The race was held over 75 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a race distance of 362 kilometres.

The race was won by Australian Jack Brabham taking his second Grand Prix victory in a works Cooper T51. Brabham dominated the race, leading all 75 laps to win by 22 seconds over British driver Stirling Moss driving a British Racing Partnership entered BRM P25. It was the first time a BRP entry finished in the top three. Brabham&#x27;s Cooper Car Company teammate, New Zealander Bruce McLaren finished in third place, just 0.2 seconds behind Moss, having lost second place late in the race. Harry Schell finished fourth for the Owen Racing Organisation BRM team a lap behind Brabham.

The British Grand Prix had the biggest entry of the season outside the Indianapolis 500 with 30 cars competing and 24 starting the race, all despite the absence of Ferrari. Strikes in Italy trapped the team at home,
leaving the British teams to fight over the race. Ferrari&#x27;s new lead driver Tony Brooks was given a release and started the race in a Vanwall but was the first to retire with misfire after 13 laps having started in a lowly 17th after winning the French Grand Prix a few weeks earlier.

The win saw Brabham expand his points lead over Brooks to 13 points. Moss and McLaren moved into fourth place just half a point behind the absent Phil Hill.

On the last lap of this race, McLaren became the youngest driver to set a fastest lap in Formula One, aged 21 years and 322 days. It was another 44 years before Fernando Alonso relieved him of that achievement with fastest lap in the 2003 Canadian Grand Prix. He was a day younger aged 21 years and 321 days.

Ethno-linguistic groups classified as Micronesian include the Carolinians (Northern Mariana Islands), Chamorros (Guam &amp; Northern Mariana Islands), Chuukese, Mortlockese, Namonuito, Paafang, Puluwat and Pollapese (Chuuk), I-Kiribati (Kiribati), Kosraeans (Kosrae), Marshallese (Marshall Islands), Nauruans (Nauru), Palauan, Sonsorolese, and Hatohobei (Palau), Pohnpeians, Pingelapese, Ngatikese, Mwokilese (Pohnpei), and Yapese, Ulithian, Woleian, Satawalese (Yap).

==Origins==
Based on the current scientific consensus, the Micronesians are considered, by linguistic, archaeological, and human genetic evidence, to be a subset of the sea-migrating Austronesian people, who include the Polynesians and the Melanesians. Austronesians were the first people to invent oceangoing sailing technologies (notably double-hulled sailing canoes, outrigger boats, lashed-lug boat building, and the crab claw sail), which enabled their rapid dispersal into the islands of the Indo-Pacific. From 2000 BCE the Austronesians assimilated (or were assimilated by) the earlier populations on the islands in their migration pathway. This intermingling occurred in the northern coast of New Guinea and adjacent islands, which was the location where the Oceanic language family developed around four thousand years or so ago, after the Austronesian languages of this area grew distinct and became a separate branch of the Austronesian family.

Migrants entered Micronesia from the east and the west. Migrants from the west came from the Philippines and Indonesia, and settled the Marianas around 3500 years ago, after which Palau was settled around 3000 years ago. Migrants from the east came from eastern Melanesia and settled the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, eastern and central Caroline Islands, Sonsorol, Pulo Anna, Merir and Tobi. The migrants from the east belonged to the Lapita culture and settled eastern Micronesia over the course of several hundreds of years from perhaps the Santa Cruz Islands, around 500-100 BC. In the following centuries, the Oceanic language variant brought by the Lapita migrants diverged and became the Micronesian branch of the Oceanic languages. John Lynch tentatively proposes a relationship between the Micronesian languages and the Loyalty Islands languages of Melanesia, but with the caveat &quot;that this is something that could well be further investigated, even if only to confirm that Micronesian languages did &quot;not&quot; originate in the Loyalties.&quot; Yap was settled separately approximately 2000 years ago, as its language was brought by an Oceanic-speaking source in Melanesia, perhaps the Admiralty Islands.

A 2022 genetic study has shown that the various peoples inhabiting Micronesia have diverse genetic origins and originate from distinct streams of migration. Micronesia was settled by three separate streams of First Remote Oceanian lineage, which corresponds to East Asian ancestry and clusters closely to modern day peoples of the Philippines such as the Kankanaey and the Amis and Atayal of Taiwan. The first wave of First Remote Oceanian lineage settled the Mariana Islands around 2800 BCE. A second separate wave settled Palau around 2400 BCE. A third separate wave settled Central Micronesia around 2100 BCE. The peoples of Central Micronesia and Palau have a degree of Papuan ancestry, but this is absent from the peoples of the Mariana Islands. The study also supports the Admiralty Islands as the source of the Central Micronesian peoples and languages.

==List of ethnic groups==
The Micronesian peoples can be divided into two cultural groups, the high-islanders and the low-islanders. The Palauans, Chamorros, Yapese, Chuukese, Pohnpeians, Kosraeans, Nauruans and Banabans belong to the high-islander group. The inhabitants of the low islands (atolls) are the Marshallese and the Kiribati, whose culture is distinct from the high-islanders. Low-islanders had better navigation and canoe technology, as a means of survival. High-islanders had access to reliable and abundant resources and did not need to travel much outside of their islands. High islands also possessed larger populations.

Archeological evidence has revealed that some of the Bonin Islands were prehistorically inhabited by members of an unknown Micronesian ethnicity.

===Banaban people===
Raobeia Ken Sigrah claims that Banabans, native to Banaba, are ethnically distinct from other I-Kiribati. The Banabans were assimilated through forced migrations and the heavy impact of the discovery of phosphate in 1900. After 1945, the British authorities relocated most of the population to Rabi Island, Fiji, with subsequent waves of emigration in 1977, and from 1981 to 1983. Some Banabans subsequently returned, following the end of mining in 1979; approximately 300 were living on the island in 2001. The population of Banaba in the 2010 census was 295. There is an estimated 6,000 people of Banaban descent in Fiji and other countries.

==== Banaban language ====
The Banabans spoke the Banaban language, which has gone extinct due to a shift to the Gilbertese language, introduced by Christian missionaries that translated the Bible into Gilbertese and encouraged the Banabans to read it. Today, only a few words remain of the original Banaban language. Today, the Banabans speak the Banaban dialect of Gilbertese, which includes words from the old Banaban language.

=== Refaluwasch people ===
The Refaluwasch people are a Micronesian ethnic group who originated in Oceania, in the Caroline Islands, with a total population of over 8,500 people in northern Mariana. They are also known as &quot;Remathau&quot; in the Yap&#x27;s outer islands. The Carolinian word means &quot;People of the Deep Sea.&quot; It is thought that their ancestors may have originally immigrated from Asia, Indonesia, Melanesia and to Micronesia around 2,000 years ago. Their primary language is Carolinian, called &quot;Refaluwasch&quot; by native speakers, which has a total of about 5,700 speakers. The Refaluwasch have a matriarchal society in which respect is a very important factor in their daily lives, especially toward the matriarchs. Most Refaluwasch are of the Roman Catholic faith.

The immigration of Refaluwasch to Saipan began in the early 19th century, after the Spanish reduced the local population of Chamorro natives to just 3,700. They began to immigrate mostly sailing from small canoes from other islands, which a typhoon previously devastated. The Refaluwasch have a much darker complexion than the native Chamorros.

===Chamorro people===
The Chamorro people are the indigenous peoples of the Mariana Islands, which are politically divided between the United States territory of Guam and the United States Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Micronesia. The Chamorro are commonly believed to have come from Southeast Asia at around 2000 BC. They are most closely related to other Austronesian natives to the west in the Philippines and Taiwan, as well as the Carolines to the south.

The Chamorro language is included in the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian family. Because Guam was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, many words derive from the Spanish language. The traditional Chamorro number system was replaced by Spanish numbers.

===Chuukese people===
The Chuukese people are an ethnic group of Chuuk State. They constitute 48% of the population of the Federated States of Micronesia. Their language is Chuukese. The home atoll of Chuuk is also known by the former name &quot;Truk&quot;.

In Chuukese culture, the men were expected to defend and protect their family. They were very protective of their clan, lineage identity and property. Backing down from a fight is not seen as manly.

===Kiribati people===
The Kiribati people, also known as &quot;I-Kiribati&quot;, &quot;Tungaru&quot;, or &quot;Gilbertese&quot;, are the indigenous people of Kiribati. They speak the Gilbertese language. They numbered 103,000 as of 2008.

===Kosraean people===
The Kosraeans or Kusaieans are the indigenous people of Kosrae. They speak the Kosraean language. They number around 8,400 as of 2013.

===Marshallese people===
The Marshallese people (Marshallese: &quot;kajoor ri-Ṃajeḷ &quot;, &quot;laḷ ri-Ṃajeḷ&quot;) are the indigenous inhabitants of the Marshall Islands. They numbered 70,000 as of 2013. Marshallese society was organized into three social classes; the &quot;iroji&quot; was the chief or landowner that headed several clans, the &quot;alap&quot; managed the clan and the &quot;rijerbal&quot; (worker) were commoners that worked the land. The three social classes treated each other well and with mutual respect.

===Nauruan people===

The Nauruans are an ethnicity inhabiting the Pacific island of Nauru. They are most likely a blend of other Pacific peoples.

The origin of the Nauruan people has not yet been finally determined. It can possibly be explained by the last Malayo-Pacific human migration (). It was probably seafaring or shipwrecked Polynesians or Melanesians that established themselves in Nauru because there was not already an indigenous people present, whereas the Micronesians were already crossed with the Melanesians in this area.

===Palauan people===

The Palauans or Belauans (Palauan: &quot;Belau&quot;, &quot;ngukokl a Belau&quot;) — are the indigenous people of Palau. They numbered around 26,600 as of 2013. Palauans are not noted for being great long-distance voyagers and navigators when compared to other Micronesian peoples. The taro is the center of their farming practices, although breadfruit has a symbolic importance.

===Pohnpeian people===
The Pohnpeians or Ponapeans are the indigenous people of Pohnpei. They number around 28,000. They speak the Pohnpeian language.

Pohnpeian historic society was highly structured into five tribes, various clans and sub-clans; each tribe headed by two principal chiefs. The tribes were organized on a feudal basis. In theory, &quot;all land belonged to the chiefs, who received regular tribute and whose rule was absolute.&quot; Punishments administered by chiefs included death and banishment. Tribal wars included looting, destruction of houses and canoes and killing of prisoners.

===Sonsorolese people===
The Sonsorolese are Micronesian people, that inhabit the islands of Pulo Anna, Merir and Sonsorol in the island nation of Palau. A small proportion live in both the Northern Mariana Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Sonsorolese are linguistically related to the Tobians. Most Sonsorolese live in the village of Echang near Koror, where they moved for economic reasons.

The Sonsorolese are both linguistically and culturally most closely related to Carolinians. Ethnographic information about them was left by Jose Somera, a member of the Don Francisco Padilla expedition who discovered the islands in 1710. According to him, their clothing consisted of an apron, cloak and conical hat, and was similar to that described by Paul Klein in 1696 among the Carolinians.

===Tobian people===
Tobian is a Micronesian language spoken in the Hatohobei (Tobi) and Koror states in Palau by about 150 people. In particular it is spoken on the island of Tobi (Torovei) in Hatohobei State, and also on Koro Island in Koror State.

Tobian is also known as Hatohobei or Tobi. It is closely related to Sonsorolese.

The Tobians share a cultural heritage that shows close ties with peoples of the central Caroline Islands, more than 1000 km to the northeast and on the other side of Palau.

===Yapese people===
The Yapese people are a Micronesian ethnic group that number around 15,000. They are native to the main island of Yap and speak the Yapese language.

==Languages==

Fifteen distinct languages are spoken by the Micronesians. The largest group of languages spoken by the Micronesians are the Micronesian languages. They belong to the family of Oceanic languages, part of the Austronesian language group. They descended from the Proto-Oceanic language, which in turn descended via Proto-Malayo-Polynesian from Proto-Austronesian. The languages in the Micronesian family are Marshallese, Gilbertese, Kosraean, Nauruan, as well as a large sub-family called the Chuukic–Pohnpeic languages containing 11 languages. The Yapese language is a separate branch of the Oceanic languages, outside of the Micronesian branch.

Two Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken that do not belong to the Oceanic languages: Chamorro in the Mariana Islands and Palauan in Palau.

==Micronesian navigation==
Micronesian navigation techniques are those navigation skills used for thousands of years by the navigators who voyaged between the islands of Micronesia in the open Pacific Ocean. These voyagers used wayfinding techniques such as the navigation by the stars, and observations of birds, ocean swells, and wind patterns, and relied on a large body of knowledge from oral tradition. Weriyeng is one of the last two schools of traditional navigation found in the central Caroline Islands in Micronesia, the other being Fanur.

==Culture==
Micronesian culture is very diverse across island atolls and influenced by the surrounding cultures. In the east one finds a more Polynesian culture with social classes (nobility, commoners and slaves) and in the west a more Melanesian-Indonesian influenced culture led by tribal chiefs without nobility, with the Marianas being an exception. Nonetheless, the Micronesians form a cultural region, as they have much more in common with each other in cultural practices and social organization than with other neighboring societies in the Philippines, Indonesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia.

The Micronesian cultures evolved from a common foundation and share a common dominator in the relationship and dependence they have with their ancestral lands. The ancestral land influenced the social organization, family structures, the economy, shared food and common work. The Micronesian family is formed from four equally important components, the household, the nuclear family, the extended family, and a lineage. The family and the community would cooperate with fishing, farming, raising children and passing knowledge to the next generations. Individuals and families would conform their behavior to cooperate with the community.

Authority was based on age, and Micronesians were taught to respect and hold their elders in high regard, which they would express by being silent in the presence of their elders. The elders would mediate and resolve conflicts.

===Music and dance===
Most Micronesian peoples lacked musical instruments, and thus produced music only by song and chants. Important men would have songs composed about their abilities or deeds, by wives or partners. These songs could live on even after death and give the men a heroic status.

===Religion===
The traditional religions of Micronesia were extremely heterogeneous. However, very little is known about most of them, as the islands were evangelized very early (from the 16th to 18th centuries) so that the indigenous religions could only survive on a few islands. However, some important manifestations of religious practice and thought can be identified for the entire Micronesian cultural space:

* Similar creation myths (origin of people from mythical ancestors - mostly ancestral mothers)
* Culture heroes (mythical seafarers as bearers of important cultural goods)
* Mythical worldviews (land and sea areas in different &quot;layers&quot; and cardinal points)
* Dualistic concepts (every material thing and every living being has a spiritual double)
* Free souls, which can leave the body in a dream
* Mana (transcendent power that can be transferred to people, but also to natural phenomena, through performance and deeds, among other things)
* Religiously motivated art styles (carvings on traditional meeting houses and religious facilities)

The traditional Micronesian religions emphasized ancestor worship and embraced spirits and ghosts. After death, one&#x27;s spirit would either pass on to an afterworld or stay on the island to either help or harm the living. A natural death would produce a benevolent ghost while an unnatural death would produce a malovent ghost. Other spirits were associated with places, natural objects, special crafts and activities. Various professions would make chants and offerings to their patron spirits, which they believed would control the outcome of their efforts. Micronesians believed that all sickness was caused by spirits. Shamans, mediums, diviners and sorcerers could be consulted to deal with the spirit world. Taboos would often be placed on food and sexual activities before a person would engage in an important pursuit. Violating this taboo would cause a spirit to send sickness or death to the offender or even the entire community.

===Mythology===
Micronesian mythology comprises the traditional belief systems of the Micronesians. There is no single belief system in the islands of Micronesia, as each island region has its own mythological beings.

Traditional beliefs declined and changed with the arrival of Europeans, which occurred increasingly after the 1520s. In addition, the contact with European cultures led to changes in local myths and legends.

<text>The Triumph GT6 is a 6-cylinder sports coupé built by Standard-Triumph, based on their popular Triumph Spitfire convertible. Production ran from 1966 to 1973.

==Development history==
In early 1963 Giovanni Michelotti was commissioned by Standard-Triumph to design a GT version of their recently introduced Spitfire 4 (also designed by Michelotti). An unmodified Spitfire 4 was delivered to Michelotti&#x27;s design studios in Italy and late in 1963 the prototype Spitfire GT4 was returned to England for evaluation. The styling of the vehicle was a success but the extra weight of the GT bodyshell resulted in extremely poor performance from the Spitfire&#x27;s Standard SC engine, and plans for producing the Spitfire GT4 were shelved.

Michelotti&#x27;s fastback design for the Spitfire GT4 prototype was adopted by the Triumph racing programme for the 1964 season, as it was deemed to provide an aerodynamic benefit over the standard Spitfire body shape. Fibreglass copies of the Spitfire GT4&#x27;s fastback were grafted on to the race-modified Spitfires destined for competition. The Spitfire racing programme was successful, and in 1965 resulted in 13th overall and a 1st in class at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans (beating their main rivals, the MG Midgets). The Spitfire&#x27;s competitive success and the continuing commercial success of the production vehicle led Triumph to re-evaluate its shelved plans for a GT version of the Spitfire. To overcome the lack of performance inherent in the heavier body style the Spitfire&#x27;s 4-cylinder engine was replaced with the more powerful Triumph inline 6 originally derived from the SC and then in use in the Triumph Vitesse (which shared a similar chassis with the Spitfire and Triumph Herald). The car was further developed and refined and eventually launched as the Triumph GT6 (dropping the &quot;Spitfire&quot; prefix) to emphasise its GT styling and its 6-cylinder engine.

Contemporary Triumph marketing advertised the GT6 as being developed from the &quot;race winning Le Mans Spitfires&quot; to capitalise on their aesthetic similarities, whereas the Le Mans Spitfires and the GT6 were actually two entirely separate development programmes (the GT programme pre-dating the racing programme). However, the marketing spin was so successful that many people erroneously believed the Le Mans Spitfires to actually be GT6s.

==Models==
The following models were produced during the production run:
Production Total (all models): 40,926

==GT6 Mk I==

The new car was introduced in 1966 and called the Triumph GT6. The new body was a sleek fastback design with an opening rear hatch, earning the GT6 the nickname of poor man&#x27;s E-Type. It was really a 2-seater, but a small extra rear seat could be ordered, large enough for small children. The family resemblance to the Spitfire Mk II was strong, the longer 6-cylinder engine necessitated a new bonnet top with a power bulge and the doors were provided with opening quarter light windows and squared-off glass in the top rear corner. The 6-cylinder engine was, like the Vitesse 2 litre, tuned to develop at 5000 rpm, and produced of torque at 3000 rpm. The increased power necessitated certain changes to the Spitfire mechanics; the radiator was new and mounted further forward in the car and the gearbox was the stronger unit from the Vitesse 2 litre, with synchromesh on all 4 forward gears. An optional Laycock de Normanville overdrive was offered giving a 20 per cent overdrive on 3rd and 4th gears. In effect this added only one ratio as overdrive 3rd was identical to 4th without overdrive. The overall gearing of overdrive and non-overdrive cars was not different as the non o/d cars came with a 3.27:1 differential while the overdrive cars&#x27; diffs were the same as the Vitesse 2 litre at 3.89:1. Front springs were uprated to cope with the extra weight of the new engine. The overall vehicle weight unladen was . The interior of the GT6 features a wooden dashboard housing a full complement of instruments, with carpets and heater included as standard.

The new car&#x27;s engine provided a top speed and in just under 12 seconds, a little better than the MGB GT. Moreover, the unit was comparatively smooth and tractable, in contrast to the MG&#x27;s four cylinder BMC B-series engine, which produced almost the same power in twin carburettor form, but at higher revs. Fuel economy was very reasonable for the period at , and the interior well up to the competition. The only major criticism was of its rear suspension; the GT6 inherited the swing-axle system from the Spitfire, which in turn was copied from the Herald small saloon. In the saloon it was tolerated, in the little Spitfire it was not liked and in the powerful GT6 it was heavily criticised. Triumph had done nothing to improve the system for the GT6 and the tendency to break away if the driver lifted off the power mid-corner was not helped at all by the increased weight at the front of the car. The handling was most bitterly criticised in the USA, an important export market for Triumph, where they were traditionally very strong. Similar criticism was being levelled at the Vitesse saloon, which shared the GT6&#x27;s engine and its handling problems.

==GT6 Mk II (GT6+)==

Triumph realised that they needed to find an answer to the handling problem, if only to maintain their reputation in the U.S. Their response came with the 1969 model year, with the introduction of the GT6 Mk II, branded in North America as the GT6+. The rear suspension was significantly re-engineered using reversed lower wishbones and Rotoflex driveshaft couplings, taming the handling and turning the Triumph into an MGB beater. The Vitesse was also modified, but the Spitfire had to wait until 1971&#x27;s Mk IV for any improvements to be made.

There were other changes for the Mk II; the front bumper was raised (in common with the Spitfire Mk 3) to conform to new crash regulations, necessitating a revised front end, and side vents were added to the front wings and rear pillars. Under the bonnet, the engine was the uprated Vitesse MkII unit developing with a new cylinder head, camshaft, and manifolds. The major changes were altered valve timing and larger inlet valves, with an increase to the width of the head. Performance improved slightly to , but perhaps more noteworthy the time dropped to 10 seconds. The fuel economy was also improved to average.

Overdrive remained a popular option for the manual transmission with the same specifications as the Mk I. Braking was updated to a dual circuit system with tandem master cylinder and emission systems began to appear in markets that mandated them. The early emission systems consisted of a diaphragm type EGR valve, carbon canister and evaporation lines and were used on other cars of the period. The fuel cap was changed to a self-sealing magnetic design.

The interior was updated with a new &#x27;non-reflective&#x27; &#x27;anti-dazzle&#x27; walnut finish dashboard and gauges with &#x27;black rimmed instruments&#x27;. Gone were the chrome toggle switches that festooned earlier models, having been replaced with smart non-reflective black rocker switches in keeping with the anti-glare theme. Headliners and matching sun visors were shipped in black and white, with white being the dominant colour in North America presumably an attempt to tame the beastly interior heat found in North American cars. Better interior ventilation was provided via flow-thru vents in the rear pillars in addition to a two-speed blower. Interior window cranks and door levers were changed and shared with the TR6 model. Tops of interior doors were covered with foam backed vinyl trim. US Market cars also received high back reclining bucket seats.

The rear reversing/number plate lamp fixture for 1970 was borrowed from the E-Type Jaguar, further cementing the E-Type associations. No doubt a consideration by Triumph to play it up. &quot;The &#x27;plus&#x27; is easily identified by the newly designed enamelled badges asymmetrically placed at the rear and on the hood.&quot; Rear tinted glass with integrated heating element was also equipped.

Optional extras available for 1970 included safety hex-hub, centre locking, 60 spoke double laced wire wheels with each spoke &quot;hand torqued to Triumph specifications&quot;. Racing mag or aluminium wheels, custom chrome plated steel roof rack, bumper guards, space for under dash radio were also listed.

==GT6 Mk III==

The final major facelift for the GT6 came in 1970 in the form of the Mk III. This time the entire bodyshell was revised to match the changes made to the Spitfire Mk IV: modifications included a cut-off rear end, recessed door handles and a smoother front end. Only detail changes were made to the mechanics, but in 1973 – close to the end of the car&#x27;s production life – the rear suspension was changed again, this time for the cheaper (but still effective) &quot;swing-spring&quot; layout fitted to the Spitfire Mk IV. This was a modification of the swing axle rear suspension used on the Herald-derived models, with the transverse leaf spring mounted on a pivot, eliminating roll stiffness at the rear, and thus greatly reducing the jacking effect under cornering loads. To compensate for this loss of roll stiffness, a larger front anti-roll bar was fitted. A brake servo was also added in 1973, and seats were changed from vinyl to cloth. There was still a fairly comprehensive options list, but the knock-on wire wheels were no longer available. The unladen weight increased slightly to .

Engine power and torque for the Mk III was similar to the Mk II, but better aerodynamics led to a new top speed of and a time of 10.1 seconds. Performance was now comfortably ahead of the MGB GT, which reached about and in approximately 13 seconds. Fuel economy was also improved to . The last USA models performed relatively poorly, owing to the compression ratios being reduced to allow the use of lower octane unleaded petrol.

The Mk III never sold in the numbers hoped for by Triumph, and was comprehensively beaten in the marketplace by the MGB. Triumph refused to release an official convertible version of the GT6 and, after poor sales, it was dropped from the Triumph range at the end of 1973, although a few cars were sold the following year.

<text>The 1959 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Automobil-Verkehrs- und Übungs-Straße in West Berlin on 2 August 1959. It was race 6 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 5 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 21st German Grand Prix and was only the second time the race was not held at the Nürburgring. AVUS had previously held the original German Grand Prix in 1926. The race was held over two 30 lap heats of the eight kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 498 kilometres.

In a unique Formula One race format, first, second and third were all claimed by the same team, Scuderia Ferrari. British driver Tony Brooks won, ahead of American teammates Dan Gurney and Phil Hill. All three drove Ferrari Dino 246s.

== Race report ==

The simplistic track consisted of a very fast straight down either side of a dual carriageway, punctuated at one end by a hairpin and at the other by a steep banking.

Also uniquely in Formula One World Championship history, the race was divided into two heats. In the first, Tony Brooks and Dan Gurney took the lead. Masten Gregory in the Cooper-Climax battled hard with them, passing first one Ferrari then the other as the lead changed hands until a big end bolt broke. It was a Ferrari 1-2-3 with Phil Hill taking the final podium place. In the second heat, once again the Ferraris had a duel at the front, this time with Bruce McLaren until he suffered transfer gear problems. On aggregate placings, it was an all-Ferrari podium in the order Brooks, Gurney, Hill. Maurice Trintignant was fourth from Jo Bonnier and Ian Burgess. This was the fastest Formula One race recorded at this time, with an average speed of 143.3 miles per hour. Hans Herrmann crashed his BRM P25 five laps into the second heat. In the approach to the southern turn he struck hay bales and rolled his car, but was thrown clear and sent sliding down the track. While the car was destroyed, Herrmann escaped unscathed. Because of this incredible luck Herrmann got his nickname &#x27;Hans im Glück&#x27;.

Former Ferrari driver Frenchman Jean Behra was due to race his Behra-Porsche Special in the Grand Prix but Behra was killed the day before racing a Porsche RSK in the Formula 2 support race at the same venue.

The results show evidence of the inconsistency with which rules were applied in this era. According to Formula One rules of the day, those drivers who retired before the end of the Grand Prix should only be classified if they pushed the car over the line after the finish. This rule was not applied to Harry Schell, who retired some 11 laps before the end. However, the rule was applied in other races, such as the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix. The rules were later clarified in 1966.

Brooks&#x27; win allowed him to close to within four points of championship leader, Australian Cooper racer Jack Brabham.

== Classification ==

=== Qualifying ===
: — Cliff Allison and Ian Burgess were listed as reserve drivers for the race. They were only allowed to start the race after Porsche withdrew following Jean Behra&#x27;s fatal accident. They started from the back of the grid.

<text>The 1959 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monsanto on 23 August 1959. It was race 7 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 6 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the eighth Portuguese Grand Prix and the second to be included in the World Championship of Drivers. It was the third time the race was held at Monsanto and the first for Formula One. The race was held over 62 laps of the five kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 337 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss, his eleventh Grand Prix victory, driving a Cooper T51 for privateer race team Rob Walker Racing Team. Moss finished a lap ahead of American racer Masten Gregory driving a similar Cooper T51 for the factory Cooper Car Company team. American Scuderia Ferrari driver Dan Gurney finished third in his Ferrari Dino 246.

== Race report ==

Wins in France and Germany had given Tony Brooks a healthy second place in the championship behind Jack Brabham. Stirling Moss improved on his poor championship position with a dominating drive, lapping the entire field. Phil Hill and Graham Hill crashed into each other on lap 6, whilst Brabham had an enormous somersaulting crash from which he emerged unscathed. Gurney was the only Ferrari in the top eight with Maurice Trintignant and Harry Schell rounding off the top five.

With Brabham failing to finish and Brooks finishing a distant five laps down in ninth, Moss closed the gap to just 9½ points behind Brabham and 5½ points behind Brooks in the championship race.

<text>The 1959 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 13 September 1959. It was race 8 of 9 in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and race 7 of 8 in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 29th Italian Grand Prix and the 24th to be held at Monza. The race was held over 72 laps of the five-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 414 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss driving a Cooper T51 for the privateer Rob Walker Racing Team. Moss won by 46 seconds over American driver Phil Hill driving a Ferrari Dino 246 for Scuderia Ferrari. Championship points leader Australian Jack Brabham finished third in works entered Cooper T51, expanding his points lead, but not sufficiently to prevent a championship showdown with Moss and Ferrari driver Tony Brooks at the United States Grand Prix.

== Race report ==
This race was won on the weight of the cars, with Stirling Moss and team manager Rob Walker gambling on running the whole race without a tyre change in the little lightweight Cooper – although they substituted knock-on wheels for bolt-ons in case a pit stop was necessary. Stirling drove a careful race, relying on the Ferrari crew needing to pit. Tony Brooks made a good start but a piston failure eliminated him on the first lap. Graham Hill and then Dan Gurney led, but lost their advantages through clumsy pit-stop action. Moss continued to win at an average speed of 124 mph, a track record. Phil Hill was second for Ferrari on their home track, ahead of a Ferrari 4–5–6 in the order Gurney, Cliff Allison and Olivier Gendebien.

Moss&#x27;s win closed the championship gap to only 5.5 points behind Jack Brabham with Brooks eight points behind Brabham. The combined efforts of Brabham, Moss, Maurice Trintignant, Bruce McLaren and Masten Gregory secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the Cooper Car Company.

<text>The 1959 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on December 12, 1959, at Sebring International Raceway in Sebring, Florida. It was the last of 9 races in the 1959 World Championship of Drivers and the 8th and final in the 1959 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.It was the second United States Grand Prix (ninth including the American Grand Prize races from 1908 to 1916), and the only occasion the race was held at the home of the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance sports car race, the Sebring International Raceway in Florida. The race was held over 42 laps of the 8.36-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 351 kilometres.

The race was won by New Zealander Bruce McLaren driving a Cooper T51 for the works Cooper team, the first win for a New Zealand-born driver. McLaren won by six-tenths of a second over French driver Maurice Trintignant driving a Rob Walker Racing Team-entered Cooper T51. British driver Tony Brooks finished third in his Ferrari Dino 246. Championship points leader Australian Jack Brabham ran out of fuel on the last lap and pushed his Cooper T51 across the line to finish fourth. Brooks&#x27;s third-place finish clinched the title for Brabham. It was the first of three world championships for Brabham, and the first for an Australian, for Cooper, and for a rear-engined car.

McLaren&#x27;s win at 22 years, 3 months and 12 days saw him become the youngest-ever Grand Prix winner, a record that would stand for over 40 years. However, he was not the youngest to win a World Championship race. That record was held by American driver Troy Ruttman who had won the 1952 Indianapolis 500 when aged 22 years, 2 months and 19 days.

This was the last race until the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix that no former world champions were in the field. This was also the last race where a bonus point for fastest lap would be awarded until the 2019 Australian Grand Prix.

==Background==
For the first time since 1951, three drivers were in contention for the title going into the final race. A win would seal it for Brabham, or just finishing in front of Stirling Moss and Brooks. Moss needed to finish first or second and ahead of Brabham, while for Brooks winning would not necessarily be enough.
* Brabham (31 points) needed either
** First
** Second, with Moss behind him
** Third with fastest lap and Moss second or lower
** Brooks second or lower and Moss third or lower
* Moss (25.5 points) needed either
** First
** Second with Brabham behind him, and Brooks first without fastest lap or lower
** Second with fastest lap, with Brabham behind him
*Brooks (23 points) needed either
** First with fastest lap and Brabham third or lower
** First, with Moss second without fastest lap or lower and Brabham third or lower

==Summary==
Russian-born Alec Ulmann&#x27;s dream of an American Grand Prix was realized in December, 1959 when 19 entries, including six American drivers, arrived in Florida for the final World Championship event of the season. Originally scheduled as the year&#x27;s opening round, the now season-concluding Sebring race saw the Championship down to Cooper versus Ferrari. Australian Jack Brabham led for Cooper with 31 points to 25.5 for Stirling Moss, also in a Cooper, and 23 for Ferrari driver Tony Brooks.

The field featured works Coopers for Brabham and 22-year-old Bruce McLaren of New Zealand; blue Rob Walker-entered Coopers for Moss and Frenchman Maurice Trintignant; four Ferraris — three in Italian red for Englishmen Brooks and Cliff Allison, and German Wolfgang von Trips; one in American white and blue for Phil Hill; front-engined Lotuses for Innes Ireland and Alan Stacey; and, incomprehensibly for the European road-racing elite, the number 1 Kurtis-Offy midget of USAC National Champion Rodger Ward, the only American-built and American-driven entry.

Ward&#x27;s car had an underpowered engine (1.7 liters to 2.5 for the F1 cars), separate gear-change levers for the two-speed gearbox and two-speed rear end, and an outboard handbrake. Ward explained how his participation in the race came about by saying, &quot;Ullman called me up and invited me to race in the Grand Prix. He offered me some money, and I was in the habit of accepting money, so I told him I&#x27;d bring the midget.&quot;

Qualifying ended with Moss, Brabham and Brooks on the front row, but, overnight, American Harry Schell was given third position, next to Moss and Brabham. The 3:05.2 lap that got Schell on the front row apparently had come at the tail end of the session, and had gone unnoticed by almost everyone; his best time previously had been 3:11.2, good enough for 11th.

Protests ensued from nearly every other team, most vociferously Ferrari, whose man, Brooks, was displaced on the front row. The shouting match raged even as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was being sung, but when it was through, Schell started from third place.

What had really happened with Schell did not come out until after the race. At Sebring, just beyond the MG bridge and before the esses was a sharp right turn that apparently led nowhere. Schell found, however, that it connected with the end of the Warehouse Straight, bypassing the entire straight and the Warehouse Hairpin. He had secretly cut across and come back on the course during a lull in the traffic – and cut six seconds off his time. It didn&#x27;t help him in the race, however; he was eighth after the first lap and retired after only six.

Moss led the race from the start and built a gap of ten seconds over Brabham, but after only five laps he retired with a broken gearbox. Already out of the running for the title was Brooks, who had been bumped off the front row by Schell&#x27;s qualifying ruse. Brooks was rammed from behind by teammate von Trips in the first turn, and pitted to examine the damage. The stop cost him two minutes, and proved to be unnecessary. Though he rejoined to drive a sensational race and finish third, he never had a realistic shot at Brabham.

Brabham took the lead from Moss while his teammate McLaren followed in second for most of the race. Midway through, with half the field out due to mechanical problems, Brabham slowed to allow McLaren to close up to him, and Trintignant&#x27;s Rob Walker Cooper began taking huge bites off their lead, as his pit crew kept him informed of his position.

As the last lap began, Trintignant was only four seconds behind the two leaders. On the long airport straight, two turns from the finish, Brabham&#x27;s car began to sputter, and it rolled to a halt 400 yards from the line on the uphill front straight, out of gas. He had refused to follow Team Manager Cooper&#x27;s exhortations to start the race on full tanks, hoping instead to find more speed from a lighter car. McLaren, surprised to see Brabham slowing, lifted his foot and slowed as well. Brabham waved him on frantically, and McLaren resumed speed just soon enough to hold his lead through the last turn and cross the line less than a second ahead of Trintignant, who had set the race&#x27;s fastest lap only three laps from the end. This would be the last Grand Prix in which Formula One awarded a point for the fastest lap until the 2019 Australian Grand Prix 60 years later.

Brabham was also passed by Brooks for third place, but the final three cars still running were several laps behind. The rules required that he finish without assistance, so he got out and pushed his car up the hill to finish fourth and earn his first World Drivers&#x27; Championship, the first for an Australian driver. Cooper also claimed its first Constructors&#x27; Championship, the first for a rear-engined car. Brooks&#x27;s third place gave Ferrari second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship; Innes Ireland was fifth, three laps down in his Lotus, and Wolfgang von Trips ended up sixth after his Ferrari&#x27;s engine gave way with four laps to go. With his victory, McLaren became the youngest ever Grand Prix winner at age 22 years, 104 days. In addition to his prize money, he also won several acres of land adjoining Sebring Lake.

Despite the exciting finish of the race and the championship, however, the United States Grand Prix at Sebring was a financial disaster. The crowd was half the size of that year&#x27;s 12 Hours of Sebring sports car race, and after distributing the $15,000 purse, including a huge $6,000 winner&#x27;s share, Alec Ulmann just about broke even. The next year, he would try again, on the opposite coast, in Riverside, California.

<doc id="1122216" wikidata="Q1762752" url="?curid=1122216" title="Melanesians">
<text>Melanesians are the predominant and indigenous inhabitants of Melanesia, in an area stretching from New Guinea to the Fiji Islands. Most speak one of the many languages of the Austronesian language family (especially ones in the Oceanic branch) or one of the many unrelated families of Papuan languages. There are several creoles of the region, such as Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu, Solomon Islands Pijin, Bislama, and Papuan Malay.

==Origin and genetics==
The origin of Melanesians is generally associated with the first settlement of Australasia by a lineage dubbed &#x27;Australasians&#x27; or &#x27;Australo-Papuans&#x27; during the Initial Upper Paleolithic, which is &quot;ascribed to a population movement with uniform genetic features and material culture&quot; (Ancient East Eurasians), and sharing deep ancestry with modern East Asian peoples and other Asia-Pacific groups. It is estimated that people reached Sahul (the geological continent consisting of Australia and New Guinea) between 50,000 and 37,000 years ago. Rising sea levels separated New Guinea from Australia about 10,000 years ago. Recent genomic studies suggest that Indigenous Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51000 to 72000 years ago, and from each other around 25000 to 40000 years ago.

The eastern part of Melanesia that includes Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji, was first inhabited by Austronesian peoples, who created the Lapita culture, and later followed by Melanesian groups. They appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the Solomon Islands, including Makira and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east.

Particularly along the north coast of New Guinea and in the islands north and east of New Guinea, the Austronesian people, who had migrated into the area more than 3,000 years ago, came into contact with these pre-existing populations of Papuan-speaking peoples. In the late 20th century, some scholars theorized a long period of interaction, which resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture among the peoples. It was proposed that, from this area, a very small group of people (speaking an Austronesian language) departed to the east to become the forebears of the Polynesian people. The indigenous Melanesian populations are thus often classified into two main groups based on differences in language, culture or genetic ancestry: the Papuan-speaking and Austronesian-speaking groups. 

This Polynesian theory was overturned by a 2010 study, which was based on genome scans and evaluation of more than 800 genetic markers among a wide variety of Pacific peoples. It found that neither Polynesians nor Micronesians have much genetic relation to Melanesians. Both groups are strongly related genetically to East Asians, particularly Taiwanese aborigines. It appeared that, having developed their sailing outrigger canoes, the ancestors of the Polynesians migrated from East Asia, moved through the Melanesian area quickly on their way, and kept going to eastern areas, where they settled. They left little genetic evidence in Melanesia, &quot;and only intermixed to a very modest degree with the indigenous populations there&quot;. Nevertheless, the study still found a small Austronesian genetic signature (below 20%) in less than half of the Melanesian groups who speak Austronesian languages, and which was entirely absent in the Papuan-speaking groups.

The study found a high rate of genetic differentiation and diversity among the groups living within the Melanesian islands, with the peoples not only distinguished between the islands, but also by the languages, topography, and size of an island. Such diversity developed over the tens of thousands of years since initial settlement, as well as after the more recent arrival of Polynesian ancestors at the islands. Papuan-speaking groups in particular were found to be the most differentiated, while Austronesian-speaking groups along the coastlines were more intermixed.

Further DNA analysis has taken research into new directions, as more &quot;Homo erectus&quot; races or subspecies have been discovered since the late 20th century. Based on his genetic studies of the Denisova hominin, an ancient human species discovered in 2010, Svante Pääbo claims that ancient human ancestors of the Melanesians interbred in Asia with these humans. He has found that people of New Guinea share 4%–7% of their genome with the Denisovans, indicating this exchange. The Denisovans are considered cousin to the Neanderthals. Both groups are now understood to have migrated out of Africa, with the Neanderthals going into Europe, and the Denisovans heading east about 400,000 years ago. This is based on genetic evidence from a fossil found in Siberia. The evidence from Melanesia suggests their territory extended into southeast Asia, where ancestors of the Melanesians developed.


Melanesians of some islands are one of the few non-European peoples, and the only dark-skinned group of people outside Australia, known to have blond hair. The blond trait developed via the TYRP1 gene, which is not the same gene that causes blondness in European blonds.

==History of classification==
Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an &#x27;old black race&#x27; in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin. By 1825 Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent developed a more elaborate, 15-race model of human diversity. He described the inhabitants of modern-day Melanesia as &quot;Mélaniens&quot;, a distinct racial group from the &quot;Australian&quot; and &quot;Neptunian&quot; (i.e. Polynesian) races surrounding them.

In 1832 Dumont D&#x27;Urville expanded and simplified much of this earlier work. He classified the peoples of Oceania into four racial groups: Malayans, Polynesians, Micronesians, and Melanesians. D&#x27;Urville&#x27;s model differed from that of Bory de Saint-Vincent in referring to &#x27;Melanesians&#x27; rather than &#x27;Mélaniens.&#x27; He derived the name &quot;Melanesia&quot; from Greek , &quot;black&quot;, and , &quot;island&quot;, to mean &quot;islands of black people&quot;.

Bory de Saint-Vincent had distinguished Mélaniens from the indigenous Australians. Dumont D&#x27;Urville combined the two peoples into one group.

Soares &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) have argued for an older pre-Holocene Sundaland origin in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) based on mitochondrial DNA. The &quot;out of Taiwan model&quot; was challenged by a study from Leeds University and published in &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot;. Examination of mitochondrial DNA lineages shows that they have been evolving in ISEA for longer than previously believed. Ancestors of the Polynesians arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea at least 6,000 to 8,000 years ago.

Paternal Y chromosome analysis by Kayser &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) also showed that Polynesians have significant Melanesian genetic admixture. A follow-up study by Kayser &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) discovered that only 21% of the Polynesian autosomal gene pool is of Melanesian origin, with the rest (79%) being of East Asian origin. A study by Friedlaender &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) confirmed that Polynesians are closer genetically to Micronesians, Taiwanese Aborigines, and East Asians, than to Melanesians. The study concluded that Polynesians moved through Melanesia fairly rapidly, allowing only limited admixture between Austronesians and Melanesians. Thus, the high frequencies of B4a1a1 are the result of drift and represent the descendants of a very few successful East Asian females.

==Austronesian languages and cultural traits==
Austronesian languages and cultural traits were introduced along the north and south-east coasts of New Guinea and in some of the islands north and east of New Guinea by migrating Austronesians, probably starting over 3,500 years ago. This was followed by long periods of interaction that resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture.

It was once postulated that from this area a very small group of people (speaking an Austronesian language) departed to the east and became the forebears of the Polynesian people. This theory was, however, contradicted by a study published by Temple University finding that Polynesians and Micronesians have little genetic relation to Melanesians; instead, they found significant distinctions between groups living within the Melanesian islands.

Genetic links have been identified between the Oceanic peoples. Polynesians are dominated by a type of macro-haplogroup C y-DNA, which is a minority lineage in Melanesia, and have a very low frequency of the dominant Melanesian y-DNA K2b1. A significant minority of them also belongs to the typical East Asian male Haplogroup O-M175.

Some recent studies suggest that all humans outside of Sub-Saharan Africa have inherited some genes from Neanderthals, and that Melanesians are the only known modern humans whose prehistoric ancestors interbred with the Denisova hominin, sharing 4%–6% of their genome with this ancient cousin of the Neanderthal.

==Incidence of blond hair in Melanesia==

Most people with blond hair are of Northern European ethno-racial origins. It evolved independently in Melanesia, where Melanesians of some islands (along with some indigenous Australians) are one of a few non-European ethnic groups who have blond hair. This has been traced to an allele of TYRP1 unique to these people, and is not the same gene that causes blond hair in the Northern European region. As with blond hair that arose in Northern Europe, incidence of blondness is more common in children than in adults, with hair tending to darken as the individual matures.

==Melanesian areas of Oceania==

The predominantly Melanesian areas of Oceania include New Guinea and surrounding islands, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji. New Caledonia and nearby Loyalty Islands for most of their history have had a majority Melanesian population, but the proportion has dropped to 43% in the face of modern immigration.

The largest and most populous Melanesian country is Papua New Guinea. The largest city in Melanesia is Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea with about 318,000 people, mostly of Melanesian ancestry. The western half of New Guinea is part of Indonesia and is predominantly inhabited by indigenous Papuans, with a significant minority of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.

In Australia, the total population of Torres Strait Islanders, a Melanesian people, , was about 38,700 identifying as being of Torres Strait Islander origin only, and 32,200 of both Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander origin (a total of 70,900).

<text>Bailleul (; &quot;Belle&quot; in Dutch) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. It is located in French Flanders, from the Belgian border and northwest of Lille.

==Population==
==Heraldry==
==Media==
Bailleul is the birthplace of French filmmaker Bruno Dumont and served as the setting for his first two feature films. This area is also a setting in the Timothy Findley book &quot;The Wars&quot;.

==Points of interest==
The city hall and belfry of Bailleul was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005 as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, in recognition of their importance in the rise of municipal power in Europe.

The Jardin des Plantes Sauvages du Conservatoire botanique national de Bailleul is a botanical garden of protected plants. Over 850 species of native plants are found in the garden.

== History ==
In 1526, Flanders fell to the Spanish Netherlands by the Treaty of Madrid. Under the reign of Philip II, the first religious problems arose between Flanders and Spain.

In the 17th century, Flanders was a permanent battlefield. Louis XIV reconquered Flanders. As a result, Bailleul reverted to France in 1678.

With the Treaty of Utrecht, Flanders and with it Bailleul fell to Austria in 1713, before both finally passed to France in 1745 after the Battle of Fontenoy and the Treaty of Aachen. Numerous fires marked the history of the city.

From the 17th to the 19th century, the bobbin lace craft developed in Bailleul. (La Maison de la Dentelle bobbin lace museum), a craft for which the town is still known far beyond its borders.

During First World War, the area around Bailleul was at times heavily affected by the heavy fighting that German and Allied troops engaged in around the nearby Belgian town of Ypres. When German troops used chlorine gas against the Allied troops near Wulverghem (municipality of Heuvelland, Belgium) on 30 April 1916 over a front length of 3.2 kilometres, the resulting toxic gas cloud extended as far as Bailleul. During the German Spring Offensive in Operation Georgette from 13 April 1918, Bailleul with its old Flemish Town Centre was more than 90 percent destroyed.
After the severe destruction of the First World War, the town was rebuilt in the Neo-Flemish style during the 20th century. A typical example of the architectural style, which was widespread throughout Flanders, is the town hall of 1932 with its bell tower.

==Railways==

Bailleul has a railway station on the line from Lille to Calais and Dunkirk.

Bailleul is twinned with:
* Werne, Germany, since 1967
* Hawick, Scotland, United Kingdom, since 1973
* Izegem, Belgium, since 1992
* Kyritz, Germany, since 2012
* Wałcz, Poland, since 2015

<doc id="1122218" wikidata="Q12455" url="?curid=1122218" title="1960 Argentine Grand Prix">
<text>The 1960 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Buenos Aires on 7 February 1960. It was race 1 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 9 in the 1960 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. This was the last Argentine Grand Prix until 1972, and the last to be held on the No. 4 configuration of the circuit.

The race was won by Bruce McLaren, his second consecutive victory, having won his first at Sebring at the end of the 1959 season. Stirling Moss suffered a suspension failure while leading, and took over Maurice Trintignant&#x27;s Cooper, but was not awarded points for third place as a result of the shared drive, a rule that had been in place since 1958.

Venezuelan driver Ettore Chimeri participated in his only grand prix. He was killed two weeks later driving a Ferrari 250 TR in Havana. He was the first driver from his country in Formula One, and the last until Johnny Cecotto in 1983. It was the only grand prix appearances for Antonio Creus, Alberto Rodriguez Larreta and Roberto Bonomi. It was also the last grand prix appearances for the driver who scored Ferrari&#x27;s first World Championship race victory, José Froilán González, and experienced American driver Harry Schell, who would be killed during practice for a non-championship race at Silverstone.

Three other local drivers took part in the practice sessions for the race. The Scuderia Centro Sud Maserati (№ 10) was driven in the first practice session by Pedro Llano, as well as by eventual race driver Nasif Estéfano and Rodriguez Larreta. In the second practice session, Julio Pola shared Chimeri&#x27;s № 44 Maserati. Also, Oscar Cabalén shared Estéfano&#x27;s car in the qualifying session as a reserve driver.

<doc id="1122219" wikidata="Q445879" url="?curid=1122219" title="Hallgrímur Pétursson">
<text>Hallgrímur Pétursson (1614 – 27 October 1674) was an Icelandic poet and a minister at Hvalsneskirkja and Saurbær in Hvalfjörður. Being one of the most prominent Icelandic poets, the Hallgrímskirkja in Reykjavík and the Hallgrímskirkja in Saurbær are named in his honor. He was one of the most influential pastors during the Age of Orthodoxy (1580–1713). Because of his contributions to Lutheran hymnody, he is sometimes called the Icelandic Paul Gerhardt.

== Biography ==

Hallgrímur Pétursson was likely born at Gröf in Skagafjörður. He grew up at Hólar, where his father was the bell-ringer and his cousin Guðbrandur Þorláksson the resident bishop. As a young man, he left Hólar for unknown reasons and travelled to mainland Europe, possibly to learn the blacksmith trade. He ended in Copenhagen, where Brynjólfur Sveinsson sponsored him to attend the seminary at the Church of Our Lady. Brynjólfur had family connections to Hallgrímur, as his half-brother was married to Hallgrímur&#x27;s aunt.

According to folk legend, Brynjólfur first encountered Hallgrímur by chance when travelling through Glückstadt in the Duchy of Schleswig (then under Danish rule). Hallgrímur&#x27;s blacksmith employer mistreated the boy, and in passing Brynjólfur heard Hallgrímur curse his employer in Icelandic. Brynjólfur took pity on the young Icelander and saw to it that the boy was educated.

During his last year of study there, Hallgrímur was employed to re-educate a group of Icelanders who had been kidnapped by Barbary pirates in the Turkish Abductions in 1627 and ransomed ten years later. Among them was a woman, Guðríður Símonardóttir, sixteen years Hallgrímur&#x27;s senior, with whom he fell in love. Guðríður was married to a man from the Westman Islands, who had not been captured in the raid. After Guðríður became pregnant by Hallgrímur, he left the seminary and returned with the group to Iceland. On their arrival it emerged that Guðríður&#x27;s husband had died, leaving her a widow; she and Hallgrímur promptly married and he worked as a labourer for a number of years.

Seven years after Hallgrímur&#x27;s return to Iceland, Brynjólfur Sveinsson, his former sponsor and then bishop at Skálholt, appointed Hallgrímur as minister at Hvalsnes. Some people were surprised that the ungraduated worker should be ordained, but Hallgrímur showed himself a skillful preacher. In 1651, he was reassigned to Saurbær in Hvalfjörður, a much sought-after position. He served there until his death in 1674 from leprosy.

== Works ==
Hallgrímur Pétursson&#x27;s most notable work is &quot;Passion Hymns&quot; (&quot;Passíusálmar&quot; or, in full, &quot;Historia pínunnar og dauðans Drottins vors Jesú Kristi, með hennar sérlegustu lærdóms-, áminningar- og huggunargreinum, ásamt bænum og þakkargjörðum, í sálmum og söngvísum með ýmsum tónum samsett og skrifuð anno 1659&quot;: &quot;The history of the pain and death of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with its special learning, reminding, and consoling articles, with prayers and praises, in psalms and songs with misc. notes, compiled and written in the year 1659&quot;), a collection of fifty hymns to be sung, one for each working day, during the seven weeks of Lent. Each hymn has a title denoting to which part of the Passion of Christ it refers and a reference to a melody to which it may be sung. 

Other famous works include &quot;Aldarháttur&quot;, &quot;Rímur af Lykla-Pétri og Magellónu&quot;, &quot;Króka-Refs rímur&quot;, and a collection of cautionary children&#x27;s rhymes.

<text>The 44th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Monday, May 30, 1960. The event was race 2 of 12 of the 1960 USAC National Championship Trail and was also race 3 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers. It would be the final time World Championship points would be awarded at the Indy 500.

Often regarded as the greatest two-man duel in Indianapolis 500 history, the 1960 race saw a then-record 29 lead changes (a record that stood until 2012). Jim Rathmann and Rodger Ward battled out nearly the entire second half. Rathmann took the lead for good on lap 197 after Ward was forced to slow down with a worn out tire. Rathmann&#x27;s margin of victory of 12.75 seconds was the second-closest finish in Indy history at the time.

The inaugural 500 Festival Open Invitation was held at the Speedway Golf Course in the four days leading up to the race.

==Time trials==
Time trials was scheduled for four days, but the third day was rained out.

*Saturday May 14 – Pole Day time trials
**Eddie Sachs set a track record of 146.592 mph to win the pole position.
*Sunday May 15 – Second day time trials
*Saturday May 21 – Third day time trials
**The third day of time trials was rained out.
*Sunday May 22 – Fourth day time trials
**Jim Hurtubise nearly broke the elusive and much-anticipated 150 mph barrier. Hurtubise&#x27;s four-lap qualifying average of 149.056 mph featured a new one-lap record of 149.601 mph (on lap 3), to establish himself as the fastest qualifier in the field.

After Carburetion tests, Dempsey Wilson replaced Jimmy Daywalt as the driver for the #23 entry, and the car was moved to the rear of the starting grid.

==Spectator fatalities==
Two spectators in the infield, Fred H. Linder, 36, of Indianapolis, and William C. Craig, 37, of Zionsville, were killed, and as many as 82 were injured, when a homemade scaffolding collapsed. Approximately 125–130 patrons had paid a small fee ($5–$10) to view the race from the 30-foot tall scaffolding, erected by a private individual (Wilbur Shortridge, Jr.) and not the Speedway – a practice that was allowed at the time. The structure was partially anchored to a pick-up truck, and situated in the infield of turn three. Over the years, the private scaffold platforms had become a popular fixture at the Speedway, with often many located around the massive infield. They were not sponsored by the track, and at times, the track management would attempt to curtail the practice, with safety in mind. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and they were not banned outright prior to 1960.

During the parade lap as the field drove by, the people on the platform began to lean and wave at the cars, which caused the scaffolding to become unstable. It soon tipped forward and fell to the ground, crushing people who were underneath the structure, and the 125–130 people who were on it either fell or jumped to the ground. Linder and Craig were pronounced dead of broken necks, and over 80 were injured, about 22 seriously.

After the accident, the Speedway banned &quot;bootleg&quot; homemade scaffolds at the track, a rule that still exists to this day. The track management was scrutinized by the state fire marshal and other officials for allowing the scaffolds to be constructed without permits, inspections, or any sort of safety rules. Other reports even criticized spectators who witnessed the tragedy and did little to offer help, whereas many in attendance were totally unaware of the accident. Johnny Rutherford, who was attending the race for the first time as a spectator, claims to have witnessed the accident. In addition, his future wife Betty Hoyer, a student nurse, attended to the scene.
==Race recap==
===First half===
The race started out with four contenders in the first half. Rodger Ward took the lead on lap 1 from the outside of the front row. Ward led the first lap. But polesitter Eddie Sachs took the lead on lap 2. Two laps later, Ward was back in front, and the record-setting number of lead changes was already under way. Troy Ruttman and Jim Rathmann also took turns at the front.

The first caution came out on lap 47 when Duane Carter spun in turn 3. He did not hit the wall, and came to a rest in the infield grass. Carter was able to continue. Moments later, Don Branson came into the pits, but came in too hot. He lost control and did a half spin, tagging the pit wall. The crew jumped out the way, and no one was injured. The damage was minimal, and Branson was able to continue.

On lap 66, Jim McWithey came into the pits without any brakes. He brushed the inside pit wall trying to slow the car down, but failed to stop. He continued through the pit lane and finally came to rest in the infield grass in turn 1. On lap 88 Eddie Russo hit the wall exiting turn two, and slid down the backstretch. Russo was taken to the hospital for a scalp wound and a concussion. During the yellow for Russo&#x27;s crash, Wayne Weiler brushed the wall in turn two. His car suffered suspension damage, and he dropped out after 103 laps.

The green came back out on lap 100, but almost immediately, the yellow light was back on. Chuck Stevenson spun in the south short-chute exiting the pits. Stevenson was able to continue in the race. It was the fourth and final yellow light period of the afternoon. The green came back out for good on lap 110.

Rodger Ward had stalled his engine twice during his first pit stop, losing considerable ground. After getting back on the track, he started charging to catch up to the front of the field. Shortly after the halfway point, Eddie Sachs and Troy Ruttman would both drop out of the race, ultimately leaving Rathmann and Ward to battle it out in front.

===Second half===
On about lap 124, Tony Bettenhausen came in for a routine pit stop. He complained of a smoking engine, but returned to the track. One lap later, he was back in the pits with a fire and a blown engine. Bettenhausen was unhurt, but hoisted himself out of the cockpit as it was coasting to stop in the pits to avoid getting burned. Safety crew extinguished the fire and no one was injured.

In the second half, Rodger Ward had caught up to Jim Rathmann, with Johnny Thomson close behind in third. Rathmann and Ward swapped the lead several times, meanwhile Ward was hoping that the pace would slow down, in order to save his tires to the end. After stalling in the pits earlier, the hard charge Ward made to get back to the front was a concern. He feared that he had worn out his tires prematurely. Ward was aware of Rathmann&#x27;s tendencies as a driver, and allowed Rathmann to pass him for the lead. Rathmann had a reputation for charging hard to take the lead, but once he was in the lead, he would often back the pace down. Ward&#x27;s prediction came true, but it was at the expense of losing ground to third place. Johnny Thomson was now catching up. Thomson&#x27;s day was not without incident, however. He blew a right rear tire around lap 145; but it occurred as he was already pulling into his pit stall for a routine pit stop.

Ward and Rathmann came in for their final scheduled pit stops on lap 148. Ward&#x27;s crew had him out first, with Rathmann right behind.

With 48 laps to go, three cars were on the lead lap. Rathmann now led Ward, and Thomson was just ten second behind in third place. With Thomson closing in on the leaders, Ward and Rathmann started charging again, racing each other hard, swapping the lead several times between themselves. Thomson narrowed the deficit to about 8 seconds, but on lap 172 his engine started losing power. He slowed and wound up nursing his car to a 5th-place finish.

===Finish===
Inside ten laps to go, Rodger Ward seemed to have the faster car, and he took the lead on lap 194. He was less than six laps from victory. Having won in 1959, it would have been his second-consecutive victory. A few moments later though, Ward observed the cords in his right front tire showing, and he backed off the pace. Jim Rathmann took the lead for good on lap 197, and pulled away for victory. Due to Ward&#x27;s extensive experience as a tire tester for Firestone, he was able to nurse his car to the finish line without pitting to change the bad tire. He finished second place, about 12 seconds behind Rathmann. Despite winning twice in his career (1959 and 1962), Rodger Ward often considered this race his personal best.

Paul Goldsmith charged from 26th starting position to finish 3rd, holding off 4th place Don Branson by about a car length.

==Race notes ==
*Fastest Lead Lap: Jim Rathmann – 1:01.59
*The 1960 Indianapolis 500 was the final 500 which featured a 33-car field consisting of all front-engined cars.
*The weather on race day would reach a high of with wind speeds up to . Climate historians would consider this to be the &quot;traditional&quot; climate for an Indianapolis 500 race.
*Despite some published claims that it was Smokey Yunick, the race-winning chief mechanic for Rathmann was Takeo &quot;Chickie&quot; Hirashima.
*Final Indianapolis 500 start for Jimmy Bryan. He would fall out of the race after completing 152 laps due to a fuel system problem. He died on June 19 after being involved in a crash during the championship race at Langhorne.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship ==
=== Background ===
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. &quot;Pop&quot; Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.

Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations. The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

=== Summary ===
The 1960 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 10 on the 1960 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit, particularly since it was held the day after the Monaco Grand Prix. Race winner Jim Rathmann earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished eighth in the final season standings. This would be the final time the Indianapolis 500 paid points towards the World Championship of Drivers.

===Radio===
The race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Sid Collins served as chief announcer. Fred Agabashian served as &quot;driver expert&quot; for the second year. After the race, Luke Walton reported from victory lane.

For the first time, the network reached South Africa via tape-delay rebroadcasts.

<text>The 1960 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 19 June 1960. It was race 5 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers and race 4 of 9 in the 1960 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Stirling Moss and Mike Taylor were seriously injured in crashes during practice, and Chris Bristow and Alan Stacey were killed in accidents during the race. With the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, it is one of two occasions in which two driver fatalities have occurred at a Formula One race meeting, and the only one where both occurred during the race itself.

== Practice and race laps 1-19 ==
Practice for the event saw Stirling Moss and Mike Taylor injured in separate accidents, with Taylor suffering injuries after a crash at Stavelot which ended his racing career, and Moss injured seriously enough (two broken legs) after crashing at Burnenville to keep him out of racing for a number of months including the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the race itself, the Lotus drivers Innes Ireland and Jim Clark got off to good starts before Ireland eventually spun out with clutch trouble on lap 14.

== Fatal accidents ==
On lap 20 Chris Bristow, driving a year-old Cooper for the British Racing Partnership, went off line at Malmedy while battling for sixth place with the Ferrari of Mairesse. Bristow lost control, crashing into a high embankment, and was thrown from his car and landed on a barbed wire fence which decapitated him.

Five laps later, Alan Stacey was hit in the face by a bird at Masta, causing him to lose control with his car somersaulting off the track and landing in a field. The car then caught fire and Stacey, still trapped inside, was burned to death. It was the only Formula One race meeting in which two drivers were killed until the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

== Race conclusion ==
The race distance had been lengthened to 36 laps from 24 laps. Jack Brabham crossed the finish line first a minute and three seconds ahead of his Cooper-Climax teammate, Bruce McLaren. The results highlight an unusual quirk in the rules regarding classification of non-finishers. Under modern rules, Graham Hill would have been classified third, since he completed lap 35 before the lapped Olivier Gendebien. Hill then retired, in the pits, but was not classified since he did not push his car over the line after the winner took the finish (as required by the rules of the time). In fact the rule about crossing the finishing line was inconsistently applied – at the 1959 German Grand Prix, Harry Schell was classified seventh despite only completing 49 of the race&#x27;s 60 laps.

=== Race ===

== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut race for Belgian driver Willy Mairesse.
* Excluding the eleven Indianapolis 500 races - that were part of the Formula One World Championship between 1950-1960 - this was the first Formula One World Championship race where a Frenchman did not participate. In all the other 77 races, a Frenchman had participated. A British driver had been present at 75 of those races.

<text>The 1960 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 4 September 1960. It was race 9 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers and race 8 of 9 in the 1960 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by American driver Phil Hill driving a Ferrari 246 F1.

==Race summary==
The 1960 season had been a frustrating one for Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One program as they campaigned their obsolete Dino 246, a front-engined car as the rear-engined design established supremacy. Due to the boycott by British teams, the championship had already been decided for Jack Brabham and Ferrari had gone without a victory. Seeing an opportunity, the Italian organizers decided to maximize Ferrari&#x27;s one advantage —straight line speed — by using the combined Monza road and banked oval circuit, making the fast Monza even faster.

Citing the fragility of their cars and the dangers of the banking, the major British factory teams of the day—Lotus, BRM, and Cooper, all boycotted the event, leading to a cobbled together field of private entrants and Formula 2 cars. Because of this boycott by the British teams, none of the drivers who started the race had previously won a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix.

The race was a processional affair, with Ginther leading at the start and eventually being overtaken by Hill. The pair with teammate Willy Mairesse raced on to a rare 1–2–3 team result for Scuderia Ferrari. The boycott also allowed Scuderia Castellotti to score its only world championship points with Giulio Cabianca finishing fourth in his Cooper T51, two laps behind Hill and ahead of Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s fourth entry, Wolfgang von Trips in a 1.5 L-engined (conforming to F2 regulations) Ferrari 156 F2 car.

It was the first victory by an American driver in a Grand Prix since Jimmy Murphy in 1921, and, excluding the Indy 500, the first by an American in the Formula One World Championship.

It was the last Formula One World Championship victory by a front-engined car, although the Ferguson P99 won the non-championship Gold Cup at Oulton Park in 1961.

===Race===
== Notes ==

* This was Phil Hill&#x27;s first win and his first pole position in his Formula One World Championship career, and also the first pole position for an American driver (excluding the Indianapolis 500 races).
* It was the Formula One World Championship debut race for Italian drivers Alfonso Thiele and Piero Drogo, British drivers Arthur Owen and Vic Wilson, and for American driver Fred Gamble.
* This was Ferrari&#x27;s third home win of an Italian Grand Prix. The Scuderia was already the most constructor and engine supplier at an Italian Grand Prix with three wins, four pole positions, five fastest laps and eighteen podiums in eleven Formula One World Championship Italian Grands Prix.

<text>The 1960 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on November 20, 1960, at Riverside International Raceway in Riverside, California. It was race 10 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers and race 9 of 9 in the 1960 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

==Summary==
For whatever reason (unfamiliarity of the fans with open-wheeled cars and European drivers; media disapproval of Eastern promoters; lack of an ongoing championship battle), promoter Alec Ulmann had no more success drumming up support for the 1960 United States Grand Prix at Riverside International Raceway in California than he had the year before in Sebring, Florida.

Set in the desert near the Box Spring Mountain complex east of Los Angeles, the Riverside track featured a particularly demanding uphill esses section, just past the start-finish line. Riverside resident and local hero Dan Gurney headed the field as the natural favorite of the crowd, which numbered only about 25,000. Jack Brabham, who had already clinched his second consecutive World Championship a few weeks prior in Portugal, was back with teammate Bruce McLaren in the factory Cooper-Climaxes. Team Lotus had cars for Jim Clark, Innes Ireland and John Surtees, while Rob Walker entered a Scottish blue Lotus for Stirling Moss. BRM had three mid-engined P48s for Jo Bonnier, Graham Hill and Gurney.

With the Championship chase over, Enzo Ferrari decided to keep his cars at home, believing his time and money would be better spent preparing for the new 1.5-liter Formula for 1961. The team&#x27;s drivers, Phil Hill and Wolfgang von Trips, however, were allowed to enter the race with other teams. Hill particularly wanted to protect his third-place position in the Championship behind Cooper teammates Brabham and McLaren.

Moss won the pole battle, well ahead of Brabham and Gurney, who completed the front row. Phil Hill was astonished at the &quot;incredible&quot; difference in handling between the year-old, rear-engined green and red Cooper he was given for the race and the Monza winning Dino Ferrari he had been driving all season, but he managed to put it only thirteenth on the grid.
&quot;On his way to the track in nearly perfect weather on Sunday morning, race promoter Ulmann realized that, indeed, he had bitten the hand that might have fed him. Following the rousing success of the Los Angeles Times-sponsored Sports Car Grand Prix that summer, where a crowd of 70,000 packed RIR, Ulmann said plainly that a genuine Formula One Grand Prix would surely do even better, since the Times race wasn&#x27;t really a Grand Prix at all!&quot;

&quot;Ulmann&#x27;s words angered Times publisher Otis Chandler, and only Ulmann was surprised when the biggest daily paper in Los Angeles and most of the local media completely ignored the event.&quot;
The small crowd of Riverside veterans who were on hand for the race, however, were stunned by the spectacle of the F1 cars. As Brabham took the early lead into Turn One, ahead of Gurney and Moss, the Riverside radio and PA announcer could only call their names and utter, &quot;Wow.&quot; The Coopers of Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien stalled on the grid, but were restarted and got under way. On lap 4, Surtees spun his Lotus in front of teammate Jim Clark, putting himself out, and causing the nosecone from his car to be used to replace the now-shattered one on Clark&#x27;s.
&quot;Still leading, Brabham paid the price for over-reacting to last year&#x27;s sputtering last lap at Sebring. Not wanting to run out of fuel again, he had overfilled his tanks, and excess fuel was spilling and being ignited by the heat of his exhaust. Two stops failed to find the source of the problem, or to assuage Brabham&#x27;s concern over the noises and flames erupting from the back of the car.&quot;
The Australian&#x27;s troubles left Moss well in front, and when Gurney&#x27;s BRM blew a core plug, Moss&#x27; teammate Bonnier took second, ahead of Ireland, Graham Hill and Texan Jim Hall, driving his first Grand Prix. Just before halfway through the 75-lap race, Graham Hill retired with a broken gearbox, and Bonnier began to drop back when a broken valve spring caused a misfire. Brabham had been charging up through the field since his pit stops, however, and eventually finished a battling fourth, behind teammate McLaren. Phil Hill ran fifth in the unfamiliar Cooper until a spin dropped him behind Bonnier, who got his ailing BRM home for two points.

Moss won the last race of the two-and-a-half liter era going away, and grabbed third in the Championship for the second year in a row. It was his fourteenth victory under the outgoing regulations, one less than five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio.

Having failed to realize his dream for Formula One in the US a second time, Ulmann nobly used his own money to pay prize and appearance fees. Winner Moss got a check for $7,500, a staggering amount for the time, and while suppliers had to wait a few months for theirs, they received every penny. Happily, the following year would see the United States Grand Prix finally settle into a regular home, with a loyal and appreciative crowd in Watkins Glen, New York. But a Formula One race would eventually return to California. In 1976, the United States Grand Prix West would come to Long Beach, only 60 miles away.

<text>The 1961 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 14 May 1961 on the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo, Monaco. It was race 1 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was also the first World Championship race under the new 1.5 litre engine regulations.

== Report ==

=== Qualifying ===
The erratic yearly variations in Monaco&#x27;s qualifying regulations saw grid places guaranteed for works teams and past winners in 1961. Therefore, the five works teams were awarded two places each on the grid, while Stirling Moss and Maurice Trintignant earned spots. This left nine drivers to fight over four remaining slots. A fifth opened up when Innes Ireland crashed during the final practice session, breaking his leg. Moss took pole position from Richie Ginther and Jim Clark, with Graham Hill and Phil Hill on the second row.

=== Race ===
Ginther led Clark and Moss into the first corner but Clark quickly ran into trouble with a faulty fuel pump. Ginther dropped to third on lap 14, when Moss and Bonnier passed him in quick succession. At quarter distance, Moss had an impressive 10 second lead (in the underpowered Lotus 18-Climax) but the Ferraris of Hill and then Ginther found their way around Bonnier and began to close the gap. At half distance, Moss&#x27; lead was 8 seconds, and down to 3 seconds on lap 60. Ginther moved into second on lap 75 and tried to close the gap, but Moss proved able to match his lap times, despite the 156&#x27;s horsepower advantage.

== Classification ==
=== Qualifying ===
: Drivers that had to qualify on speed: only the five fastest (four before Ireland&#x27;s injury) would race.

===Race===
== Notes ==

* This was the third time Stirling Moss had won the Monaco Grand Prix, thereby breaking the old record of two Grand Prix wins set by Juan Manuel Fangio at the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix.
* This was the 50th race for Cooper.

<text>The 1961 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 22 May 1961 at Zandvoort. It was race 2 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

Taking place one week after the Monaco Grand Prix, there was no time for Innes Ireland to heal from his injury in the previous race, so he was replaced by Trevor Taylor. The front row was taken up by three Ferraris. Wolfgang von Trips took the lead from the start and led every lap. Phil Hill was second but was soon pressured by Jim Clark, who had started from the fourth row. The two would trade second place often with the Ferrari quicker on the straight and the Lotus faster in the corners. This continued until about 20 laps from the end when Clark&#x27;s handling allowed the Ferrari to pull away. Fourth place was contested between Stirling Moss and Richie Ginther, with Moss passing Ginther on the final lap. The race was the first of 20 races in Formula 1 history in which every car that started the race was classified as a finisher. In addition, no drivers made any pit stops; only one of only two World Championship races in history to have this latter distinction - the other being the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix - which was red-flagged after two full laps due to bad weather.

<text>The 1961 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 18 June 1961 at Spa-Francorchamps. It was race 3 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The organizers of the race invited 25 entries, but were only going to pay starting money to 19: sixteen pre-selected cars plus the 3 fastest of the remaining 9. Three of the cars without starting money decided not to race after practising. A fourth entry was a single car for Cliff Allison and Henry Taylor. UDT Laystall decided to let the fastest driver in practice compete, but Allison wrecked the car on his first practice lap. The Emeryson cars were also discarded by Equipe Nationale Belge after discovering terminal chassis damage on one of them, although Willy Mairesse gained the use of a Team Lotus spare machine to post a better time on Saturday. The team eventually reached a deal for Mairesse and Lucien Bianchi to compete in the race with the older, yet proven, Lotus 18s of non-starters Marsh and Seidel. 

The race was completely dominated by the Ferrari team, with the four works drivers finishing 1-2-3-4. This was the last time any constructor achieved this score in a F1 race. Of the four works Ferraris, three cars were painted red in the tradition of rosso corsa, the national racing colour of Italy, and Gendebien&#x27;s car was painted in a Belgian racing yellow. Apart from two NART entries in the season this was the last time a Ferrari car wore other than the traditional red colour in Formula One. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start from sixth on the grid, he could not hold off the Italian cars and all had passed him by the end of the first lap. Hill fought with John Surtees for fifth place until he retired with an oil leak on the 24th lap.

<text>Jim Curtin (born June 23, 1979) is an American professional soccer coach and former player who was most recently the head coach of the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer. He spent most of his playing career with the Chicago Fire.

==Early life and education==
Curtin grew up in Oreland, Pennsylvania and played high school soccer at Bishop McDevitt. He excelled in college soccer at Villanova University, where he was named the Big East Rookie of the Year his freshman year and was named a first-team All-Big East selection in both his junior and senior seasons.

==Club career==
=== Chicago Fire ===

Following graduation, Curtin became the first Wildcat to be drafted by the MLS when he was selected by the Chicago Fire. Perceptions that Curtin was not athletic enough to play professionally, and the relative obscurity of Villanova, led to Curtin not being drafted until the third round of the 2001 MLS SuperDraft.

Curtin made his professional debut against D.C. United at Soldier Field during the second week of the 2001 MLS season. Curtin was named to the starting line-up after starting tandem Diego Gutierrez and Andrew Lewis received straight red cards in the opening match against Columbus Crew. In the same season, the Fire sent Curtin on loan to the Milwaukee Rampage in three early-season games and for the USL A-League playoffs. His rookie year saw 12 starts and registering 1,194 minutes.

From his second season onward, Curtin would anchor a starting spot in the Fire&#x27;s centerback tandem, started 22 games and played 2,121 minutes. Curtin started every game for the Fire in 2003, playing alongside Carlos Bocanegra and helped the team&#x27;s defense compensate for Bocanegra&#x27;s loss in 2004. He would go on to play in more than 200 games for the Fire, which included U.S. Open Cup championships in 2003 and 2006. He was also named 2004 MLS All-Star and the March of Dimes/Comcast Athlete of the Year in 2005.

In 2014, while serving as head coach of the Philadelphia Union, Curtin was ceremonially retired as a Chicago Fire player.

=== Chivas USA ===
On February 7, 2008, one day after his daughter Ryan was born he was traded to Chivas USA for a conditional pick in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft. After two seasons in southern California, Curtin was waived by Chivas USA on January 26, 2010.

==Coaching career==

===Philadelphia Union===
After departing Chivas, Curtin returned to the Philadelphia region and began working with the newly formed Philadelphia Union as a coach in the academy system in June 2010. In November 2012, Curtin was named assistant coach for his hometown Philadelphia Union, under John Hackworth and alongside Brendan Burke and Rob Vartughian.

During the 2014 season, Hackworth was fired after a run of poor results with Curtin being named interim coach during the team&#x27;s search for a permanent replacement. The Union saw a turnaround of form under Curtin, losing only 5 of the remaining 16 matches in the season and advanced to the U.S. Open Cup final, ultimately finishing runners-up to Seattle Sounders FC in extra time. This success was rewarded on November 7, 2014, the Philadelphia Union announced that Curtin would take the reins as the head coach; removing the &quot;interim&quot; title he had held previously.

The 2015 season still saw the Union struggle during the regular season but made a second consecutive appearance in the U.S. Open Cup final, losing this one to penalty kicks at home to Sporting Kansas City.

Near the end of the 2015 season, the Union fired Nick Sakiewicz as CEO and appoint Earnie Stewart as &quot;Sporting Director&quot; to work with Curtin and address the team&#x27;s struggles. Initial improvements saw the Union returning to the post-season in 2016 for the first time since the 2011 season. During this season, with a win over rivals New York City FC on April 23, 2016, Curtin set a record five consecutive home wins as well as becoming the highest wins coach in Union history.

The Union were unable to build on their 2016 success, finishing with the same record but still missing the playoffs in 2017. Curtin was announced to retain his head coach position for the 2018 season.

Ahead of the 2019 season, Union Sporting Director, Ernst Tanner, announced that Curtin would be retained for the upcoming season on a one-year extension. By July of that season, the Union reach first place in the Eastern Conference and hitting the club&#x27;s best start to a season. This success lead to the club announcing Curtin signed a two-year contract extension, to remain head coach through the 2021 season.

The 2020 season was the most successful to date for the Union and Curtin&#x27;s coaching career. Despite disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union reached the semi-final of the MLS is Back Tournament and went on to won their first trophy finishing top of the league standings and earning the 2020 Supporters&#x27; Shield. The team&#x27;s performance over the season earned Curtin his first Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year Award. Winning the Supporter&#x27;s Shield earned the Union their debut in the CONCACAF Champions League, where the Union earned their first international win against Deportivo Saprissa; a victory that marked Curtin&#x27;s 100th win as head coach of the club.

On November 7, 2024, after a season in which the Union failed to qualify for the postseason for the first time since 2017, it was announced that the club had parted ways with Curtin.

<text>The 1961 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 2 July 1961 at Reims. It was race 4 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

By winning the race, Giancarlo Baghetti became only the third driver to win his first World Championship race, the other two being Nino Farina, who won the first World Championship race (the 1950 British Grand Prix) and Johnnie Parsons, who won the 1950 Indianapolis 500 (the Indianapolis 500 was part of the World Championship from 1950 to 1960), though both Farina and Parsons had competed at future World Championship races before the creation of the championship, while this was Baghetti&#x27;s first start at a major Grand Prix. This was Baghetti&#x27;s only World Championship race win. He would never finish in the top 3 again.

=== Qualifying ===

† Bianchi was absent for the first day of qualifying. Taylor qualified on Day 1 with Bianchi&#x27;s car, but French timekeepers only tied the laptimes of a given car to the driver listed alongside in the programme, and his laptime was attributed to Bianchi.

== Notes ==

* This was the first Formula One World Championship podium for Porsche as a constructor and engine supplier.

<text>The 1961 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race, held on 15 July 1961 at the Aintree Circuit, near Liverpool. It was race 5 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

Following a wet weekend, with torrential rain affecting both qualifying and the race start, the Grand Prix was ultimately dominated by Scuderia Ferrari, with their drivers taking all three podium positions. The race was won by German Wolfgang von Trips, who had led for much of the race after starting from fourth place on the grid. This was von Trips&#x27;s second but also his final Grand Prix victory as two races later he was killed in an accident during the 1961 Italian Grand Prix; it was also the last full-length Grand Prix won by a German until Michael Schumacher achieved his first of 91 wins at the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix. Pole position winner Phil Hill drove to second place on his way to winning the World Drivers&#x27; Championship at the end of the season, and third place was taken by Hill&#x27;s American compatriot Richie Ginther.

The 1961 British Grand Prix is also notable as being the first occasion on which a four-wheel drive car, and the last at which a front engined car was entered for a World Championship race. These two accomplishments were achieved by the same vehicle: the experimental Ferguson P99-Climax run by the Rob Walker Racing Team. Although the car was disqualified for receiving assistance on the track, in the hands of Stirling Moss – who took over the car from first driver Jack Fairman after his own Lotus&#x27;s brakes failed – it showed some promise. The 1961 British Grand Prix also marked the last occasion on which Moss contested a Grand Prix race on home soil, as his career was ended by an accident during a non-championship race prior to the 1962 season.

<text>The 1961 German Grand Prix was the 23rd time the German Grand Prix (or Grosser Preis von Deutschland) motor race was held. The race also held the honorary designation of the 21st European Grand Prix. It was run to Formula One regulations as race 6 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers It was held on 6 August 1961 over 15 laps of the giant 14.2 mile Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit for a race distance of almost 213 miles. The race also celebrated the 100th race since the establishment of the World Championship in 1950.

The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss, driving a Lotus 18/21 for privateer outfit the Rob Walker Racing Team; it proved to be his 16th and last Grand Prix victory. Moss started from the second row of the grid and led every lap of the race. It was the first German Grand Prix victory for a rear-engined car since Bernd Rosemeyer&#x27;s Auto Union Type C took victory in 1936. Moss finished just over 20 seconds ahead of Ferrari 156 drivers Wolfgang von Trips and Phil Hill, breaking a four-race consecutive run of Ferrari victories. The result pushed Moss into third place in the championship points race, becoming the only driver outside Ferrari&#x27;s trio of von Trips, Hill and Richie Ginther still in contention to become the 1961 World Champion with two races left.

Jack Brabham&#x27;s Cooper took full advantage of the new Coventry-Climax V-8 in qualifying. Brabham qualified second, and shot to the lead by the first corner. However, Brabham crashed before the end of the first lap due to a sticking throttle. It was the last home country appearance for points leader von Trips before his death at the Italian Grand Prix five weeks later. His second-place finish saw Ferrari secure the constructors&#x27; championship. The remaining championship points scorers were all from British racing teams. Scottish driver Jim Clark (Lotus 21) was fourth for Team Lotus; former motorcycle World Champion John Surtees (Cooper T53) was fifth for Yeoman Credit Racing and young New Zealander Bruce McLaren was sixth in his factory-run Cooper T58.

Of the race&#x27;s 26 starters, 17 finished the race with 16 of them classified finishers. Bernard Collomb (Cooper T53) did not complete the 75% race distance in order to be classified as a finisher.

<text>The 1961 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 1961 at Monza. It was race 7 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The race was marked by one of the most terrible accidents in the history of Formula One, when on the end of lap 2, at the approach to the Parabolica, German driver Wolfgang von Trips lost control of his Ferrari after colliding with the Lotus of Jim Clark and crashed into a fence line of spectators, killing 15 and himself. The race was not stopped, allegedly to avoid the audience going home &quot;en masse&quot; jamming the roads around the stadium and thus impeding the rescue work for the injured. This was also the last Formula One race ever to be held on the full Monza circuit, with the two banked corners and the straight between the bankings included.

The race was won by von Trips&#x27;s American teammate Phil Hill; since von Trips was the only one who could challenge him, Hill won the World Championship with one race to go. Hill&#x27;s Monza win also assured Ferrari of the Constructors&#x27; Championship for 1961.

== Background ==
Before the running of the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, four drivers were mathematically in contention for the year&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship: Wolfgang von Trips, Phil Hill, Stirling Moss, and Richie Ginther. Realistically, however, the championship had come down to two Ferrari drivers, von Trips and Hill.

In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, two teams were mathematically in contention: Ferrari, and Lotus-Climax. In order for Lotus to overtake Ferrari at this point, one of their drivers had to win &quot;both&quot; this race and the final race of the season, the 1961 United States Grand Prix.

== Qualifying ==
37 cars attempted to qualify for the Italian Grand Prix, and 32 had sufficiently fast times to make it to the race grid. Similar to the 107% rule of today, a rule was in place for the 1961 season enforcing a 115% cutoff against the time of the second fastest driver.

<doc id="1122242" wikidata="Q2463775" url="?curid=1122242" title="Dedekind sum">
<text>In mathematics, Dedekind sums are certain sums of products of a sawtooth function, and are given by a function &quot;D&quot; of three integer variables. Dedekind introduced them to express the functional equation of the Dedekind eta function. They have subsequently been much studied in number theory, and have occurred in some problems of topology. Dedekind sums have a large number of functional equations; this article lists only a small fraction of these.

Dedekind sums were introduced by Richard Dedekind in a commentary on fragment XXVIII of Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s collected papers.

== Definition ==
Define the sawtooth function formula_1 as 
:formula_2

We then let

:formula_3

be defined by

:formula_4

the terms on the right being the Dedekind sums. For the case &quot;a&quot; = 1, one often writes

:&quot;s&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(1, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;).

==Simple formulae==
Note that &quot;D&quot; is symmetric in &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and hence

:formula_5

and that, by the oddness of (( )),

:&quot;D&quot;(−&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;) = −&quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;),

:&quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; −&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;).

By the periodicity of &quot;D&quot; in its first two arguments, the third argument being the length of the period for both,

:&quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;+&quot;kc&quot;, &quot;b&quot;+&quot;lc&quot;; &quot;c&quot;), for all integers &quot;k&quot;,&quot;l&quot;.

If &quot;d&quot; is a positive integer, then

:&quot;D&quot;(&quot;ad&quot;, &quot;bd&quot;; &quot;cd&quot;) = &quot;dD&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;),

:&quot;D&quot;(&quot;ad&quot;, &quot;bd&quot;; &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;), if (&quot;d&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) = 1,

:&quot;D&quot;(&quot;ad&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;cd&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;), if (&quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = 1.

There is a proof for the last equality making use of

:formula_6

Furthermore, &quot;az&quot; = 1 (mod &quot;c&quot;) implies &quot;D&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;; &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(1, &quot;bz&quot;; &quot;c&quot;).

==Alternative forms==

If &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are coprime, we may write &quot;s&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) as

:formula_7

where the sum extends over the &quot;c&quot;-th roots of unity other than 1, i.e. over all formula_8 such that formula_9 and formula_10.

If &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 are coprime, then

:formula_11

==Reciprocity law==
If &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are coprime positive integers then

:formula_12

Rewriting this as

:formula_13

it follows that the number 6&quot;c&quot; &quot;s&quot;(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) is an integer.

If &quot;k&quot; = (3, &quot;c&quot;) then

:formula_14

and

:formula_15

A relation that is prominent in the theory of the Dedekind eta function is the following. Let &quot;q&quot; = 3, 5, 7 or 13 and let &quot;n&quot; = 24/(&quot;q&quot; − 1). Then given integers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; with &quot;ad&quot; − &quot;bc&quot; = 1 (thus belonging to the modular group), with &quot;c&quot; chosen so that &quot;c&quot; = &quot;kq&quot; for some integer &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0, define
:formula_16

Then &quot;n&quot;δ is an even integer.

==Rademacher&#x27;s generalization of the reciprocity law==
Hans Rademacher found the following generalization of the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums: If &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are pairwise coprime positive integers, then

:formula_17

Hence, the above triple sum vanishes if and only if (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) is a Markov triple, i.e. a solution of the Markov equation 

:formula_18

<text>Stattena IF is a Swedish football club located in Helsingborg. The club played two seasons in the Allsvenskan in 1927–28 and 1929–30.

==Background==
The original club Stattena was one of the two clubs which in 1907 formed Helsingborgs IF. The present club was re-formed on 24 March 1922 and the ladies section was added in 1971.

The club was founded as a local neighborhood team from the Stattena district in Helsingborg. Originally a village, which was located outside the city, which probably contributed to the historical, local patriotic rivalry with Helsingborgs IF.

Since their foundation Stattena IF&#x27;s men&#x27;s team has participated in the upper and lower divisions of the Swedish football league system. In their early years the club played in the Allsvenskan for two seasons in 1927–28 and 1929–30. They play their home matches at the Olympiafältet in Helsingborg. The team colours today are blue and white, but historically blue and yellow striped shirts and blue shorts. The kit were later taken over by local competitor Eskilsminne IF. Eskilsminne previously played in a light and dark purple-striped shirt and white shorts.

When Stattena played in the best tier Allsvenskan in the 1920s and 1930s, they had an almost Southern European support group, who watched the training sessions, lively discussed lineups etc. at the beer cafes, and met the team at the train station when they returned to Helsingborg after away matches. Unfortunately, opposing supporters were also hit by a rain of beer bottles, which were thrown at them. When the star player and future national team player Knut Kroon was sold from Stattena to arch-rival Helsingborgs IF, he could barely show up in town.

When Stattena played the Allsvenskan Helsingborg derby against Helsingborgs IF at the Olympia season 1929–30, and Helsingborgs IF got a penalty kick, penalty taker Axel Alfredsson uttered the winged words, which illustrate the rivalry between the teams, despite Helsingborgs IF becoming champions and Stattena got relegated: &quot;I put hatred behind the ball. Stattena has got to lose!&quot;

Five years after their formation, in 1971, the ladies team climbed to the Damallsvenskan. More recently the team has played at the same level in 2003, 2004 and 2009.

Stattena IF are affiliated to the Skånes Fotbollförbund. The club is a member of the Helsingborgs Fotbollsklubbars Allians (Helsingborg Football Club Alliance) and has 900 members with 20 youth teams comprising 11 boys teams and 9 girls teams. The club also cooperates with Filbornaskolan to provide top-level female players with the opportunity to combine football development with a four-year secondary education.

<doc id="1122245" wikidata="Q14963" url="?curid=1122245" title="Rocking chair">
<text>A rocking chair or rocker is a type of chair with two curved bands (also known as rockers) attached to the bottom of the legs, connecting the legs on each side to each other. The rockers contact the floor at only two points, giving the occupant the ability to rock back and forth by shifting their weight or pushing lightly with their feet. Rocking chairs are most commonly made of wood. Some rocking chairs can fold.

==Etymology==
The word rocking chair comes from the verb &quot;to rock&quot;. The first known use of the term &quot;rocking chair&quot; was in 1766.

==Purpose==

Rocking chairs are often seen as evocative of parenting, as the gentle rocking motion soothes infants and sends them off to sleep.

Many adults find rocking chairs soothing because of the gentle motion. Gentle rocking motion has been shown to provide faster onset of sleep than remaining stationary, mimicking the process of a parent rocking a child to sleep.

Rocking chairs are also comfortable because, when a user sits in one without rocking, the chair automatically rocks backward until the sitter&#x27;s center of gravity is met, thus granting an ergonomic benefit with the occupant kept at an un-stressed position and angle.. Rockers are also good to use during pregnancy as it reduces back pain and promotes relaxation and stress reduction. 

Varieties of rockers include those mounted on a spring base (or platform) called &quot;platform rockers&quot; and those with swinging braces commonly known as gliders.

==History==

Rocking cradles long predate rocking chairs and an example exists from antiquity, found in the ruins of Herculaneum.

Originally used in gardens, rocking chairs were simply ordinary chairs with rockers attached. In 1725, early rocking chairs first appeared in England. Though American inventor Benjamin Franklin is sometimes credited with inventing the rocking chair, historians actually trace the rocking chair&#x27;s origins to North America during the early 18th century, when Franklin was a child. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century. These wicker rockers, as they were popularly known, were famous for their craftsmanship and creative designs. 

During the 1830s, Peter Cooper designed the first steel chair in America which was a rocking chair, and was displayed at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851.

Michael Thonet, a German craftsman, created the first bentwood rocking chair in 1860. This design is distinguished by its graceful shape and its light weight. These rocking chairs were influenced by Greek and Roman designs as well as Renaissance and colonial era artistry.

During the 1920s, however, folding rocking chairs became more popular in the United States and in Europe. They were handy for outdoor activities and travel purposes. By the 1950s, rocking chairs built by Sam Maloof, an American craftsman, became famous for their durability and deluxe appearance. Maloof&#x27;s rocking chairs are distinguished by their ski-shaped rockers.

==Types of rocking chair==

=== Peter Cooper ===
Peter Cooper, an American industrialist and inventor, designed an iron-frame chair with a functional, minimalist design radically different from Victorian heavily decorated, ostentatious designs. At that time most rocking chairs had separate rockers fixed to regular chair legs, Cooper&#x27;s chair used the curve of its frame to ensure the rocking motion. Coopers chair was made of steel or wrought iron with upholstery slung across the frame. Cooper&#x27;s model was manufactured at R.W. Winfield &amp; Co. in Britain. The firm exhibited examples of the chair at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations (Crystal Palace Exhibition) in 1851 and the Great London Exposition of 1862.

===Bentwood===
Michael Thonet received a patent in 1856 for the process of bentwood manufacturing, when he and his five sons began to produce innovative ‘bentwood’ furniture. Rare Antique Thonet Bentwood Rocking Chair Figural Carved and Pressed Wood with Griffins and Northwind Face. Item features figural pressed wood back and seat with griffin and northwind face.

===Boston===
Actually made in Connecticut, Boston rockers were traditionally made of oak and pine, painted black, and embellished with fruit and flower designs.

===Folding===
Folding rocking chairs were popular starting in the 1870s. They come in a variety of styles, but are recognized by backs designed to fold down to the seat.

===Wicker===
Wicker rocking chairs were machine-manufactured rocker armchairs from the early 20th century. These were usually part of a sun parlor set, which included a sofa, side chairs, a table, a planter, and a floor lamp.

===Pressed back===
The pressed back rocking chair was part of the American colony revival style that lasted from about 1870-1920. It has a raised design of the wood on the back.

===Ladder back===
The ladder back rocking chair has a tall back with horizontal slats.

<text>The 1961 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 8, 1961, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was the eighth and final race in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The United States Grand Prix had been held at two different circuits in its previous three runnings, but subsequently remained at Watkins Glen until 1980. The season-ending race was won by British driver Innes Ireland, his only career Grand Prix win. He started eighth, took the lead when the engine in Stirling Moss&#x27; Lotus failed, and finished 4.3 seconds ahead of American Dan Gurney. The win was the first victory for Colin Chapman&#x27;s Team Lotus.

==Background==
By the time of the Watkins Glen event, the 1961 season had seen Californian Phil Hill crowned the first American World Champion. However, he did not take part in the race as the Scuderia Ferrari team had remained home. In the previous race, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Ferrari driver and team leader Wolfgang von Trips had been killed in a crash while leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship, handing victory and the Championship to Hill. Since Ferrari had clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship as well as the Drivers&#x27;, the team chose not to make the trip across the Atlantic for the season finale.

There had been considerable doubt about whether the US race would even take place, since the FIA did not grant the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation final approval for the event until August 28. By October, however, the field was missing only the Ferrari team.

Howard Hughes visited the pits to meet with John Cooper about expanding his car manufacturing business. A photograph taken of Hughes in the pits and published in the May 10, 1976, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine was the last known photograph of him.

==Qualifying==
While all but the two Porsche entries had Climax engines, only Jack Brabham of the factory Cooper team, and Stirling Moss, in Rob Walker&#x27;s privately entered Lotus, had the newest developmental V8 version available to them. Moss set the pace on Saturday with a lap time of 1:18.2 in his 4-cylinder car, then posted a 1:17.2 with the V8. Brabham, the just-deposed two-time World Champion, responded by taking the pole with a 1:17.0. When Moss decided to use the older 4-cylinder in the race, saying that the car handled better with it, he dropped back to the second row of the grid, next to Brabham&#x27;s teammate, Bruce McLaren. Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM, a tenth quicker than the other 4-cylinder cars, was alongside Brabham on the front row, a second slower than the Australian.

Jim Clark, in one works Lotus, took fifth spot, while Ireland, his teammate, qualified eighth. On Friday, Ireland spun to the edge of the woods in the 180-degree South Loop when his steering failed. The following day, before he could put in a serious time, his gearbox broke. The back of the grid was filled largely with independent North American drivers in uncompetitive cars. Canadian Peter Ryan, in his only grand prix, led a group containing Walt Hansgen, Roger Penske, Hap Sharp, Jim Hall and Lloyd Ruby. Penske&#x27;s car was one of the first instances of commercial sponsorship in F1, painted in bright DuPont Anti-Freeze yellow.

==Race summary==
A paid crowd of 28,000 (total around 60,000) attended the race on Sunday. At the start, Brabham led the field off the grid and into the first corner, but before the end of the first lap, Moss had moved into the lead. These two were followed by Ireland (up from eighth), Hill, Dan Gurney, Masten Gregory and McLaren. On lap three, McLaren moved up to third when Ireland spun on oil at the end of the straight. &quot;I nearly went out of the race,&quot; he said. &quot;I went into a whirl, a 360-degree spin, cars were whipping past.&quot; He recovered and continued in eleventh.

By lap 10, Ireland had already moved up to fourth, behind McLaren&#x27;s Cooper, as Moss and Brabham continued to draw away at a second a lap, swapping the lead back and forth. At about one-third distance, on lap 34, Brabham&#x27;s V8 began to leak water and overheat. With puffs of smoke appearing from the left-side exhaust, the Cooper dropped back from Moss and finally entered the pits on lap 45. After taking on water and returning to the race, Brabham completed only seven more laps before retiring.

Leading now by over 40 seconds, Moss seemed on his way to a comfortable victory. However, his oil pressure was dropping, and on lap 59, the dark blue Lotus peeled off and retired suddenly, handing the lead to Ireland. Hill was right on the tail of the Scot, hounding him for 15 laps, until he, too, suddenly coasted down the pit lane with a loose magneto wire. The next challenger was Roy Salvadori, who began trimming the lead from 20 seconds down to five with only five laps left. But it was Ireland&#x27;s day. With just over three laps remaining, Salvadori&#x27;s privately entered Cooper blew its engine, just as his teammate John Surtees&#x27; car had done on the first lap.

Ireland came home under the waving checkered flag of Tex Hopkins, less than five seconds ahead of American Dan Gurney, as Britain&#x27;s Tony Brooks finished the last GP of his career in third. &quot;I was lucky,&quot; said Ireland. &quot;I could not take Moss or Brabham. Their cars were too fast. I had no fuel pressure in the last ten laps, and ended up with a thimbleful of gas at the finish.&quot;

It was Ireland&#x27;s only World Championship win, the first World Championship win for Team Lotus, and the first American Grand Prix to turn a profit, ensuring its return in 1962. It was Moss&#x27;s last World Championship race, as his career was ended by a heavy accident during the 1962 Glover Trophy race at Goodwood the following April.

<text>The 1962 Dutch Grand Prix was the eleventh time the Dutch Grand Prix (or Grote Prijs van Nederland) motor race was held. The race also held the honorary designation of the 22nd European Grand Prix. It was run to Formula One regulations on 20 May 1962 as race 1 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was held over 80 laps of the compact 2.6 mile Circuit Park Zandvoort for a race distance of just over 200 miles.

The race was won by British driver Graham Hill driving a BRM P57. It was the first Grand Prix victory for the future dual-World Champion and the second time a BRM driver had won the race after Jo Bonnier in 1959. Hill finished over 27 seconds ahead of Team Lotus driver Trevor Taylor driving a Lotus 24. The reigning World Champion, Ferrari&#x27;s Phil Hill (Ferrari 156) placed third.

The race indicated the season to come as the long-maligned British Racing Motors organisation was on their way to their first and ultimately only constructor&#x27;s championship. It also signalled Hill&#x27;s own rise in the sport, having only stood on the podium once before, at the same circuit two years previously. He would win three more races this year and be crowned World Champion.

<text>The 1962 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 3 June 1962. It was race 2 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 100-lap race was won by Cooper driver Bruce McLaren after he started from third position. Phil Hill finished second for the Ferrari team and his teammate Lorenzo Bandini came in third.

==Report==

Lotus&#x27;s Jim Clark claimed the first pole position of his career, ahead of BRM&#x27;s Graham Hill, Cooper&#x27;s Bruce McLaren and Ferrari&#x27;s Willy Mairesse. The organisers guaranteed two spots on the grid for each of the 5 works teams, leaving six grid spots for the remaining entries to fight over. This explains why some drivers with faster qualifying times failed to qualify whereas drivers with slower times qualified.

Mairesse got an excellent start from fourth on the grid and led into the first corner, the Gasworks hairpin, but braked too late and skidded around it. The concertina effect of the cars behind trying to avoid Mairesse&#x27;s skidding car led to a collision further behind which eliminated Dan Gurney, Maurice Trintignant and Richie Ginther. A marshal, Ange Baldoni, was killed by the dislodged right rear wheel of Richie Ginther&#x27;s BRM when it collided with the Lotuses of Maurice Trintignant, Innes Ireland and Trevor Taylor, as well as Dan Gurney&#x27;s Porsche at the Gasometer hairpin on lap 1.

McLaren and Graham Hill both passed Mairesse on the exit of Gasworks hairpin; the New Zealander ended the first lap in the lead from the Englishman. Meanwhile, Mairesse spun at the station hairpin on the first lap, dropping down the order.

McLaren led until the seventh lap when he was passed by Graham Hill; the BRM driver held the lead all the way until lap 92, when an engine failure handed the lead back to McLaren who held on to win ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Phil Hill, who recovered from a spin earlier in the race. Hill&#x27;s Ferrari team mate Lorenzo Bandini completed the podium places.

<text>The 1962 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 17 June 1962. It was race 3 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. This race was notable for being the first Grand Prix win for Jim Clark, and the first of four consecutive victories at Spa for the Scotsman (despite thoroughly disliking the circuit) and Team Lotus. It was also the first win for the famous Lotus 25, and the beginning of the famous 6-year-long rivalry between Clark and Graham Hill. This race was held the same day as the 1962 FIFA World Cup Final in Santiago, Chile, but that event took place later in the day from this Grand Prix.

Ricardo Rodríguez became the youngest driver to score championship points (20 years, 123 days), a record which stood for 38 years before Jenson Button, aged 20 years, 67 days, broke it at the 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix. Trevor Taylor and Willy Mairesse were fighting for 2nd place until the 2 cars touched, crashed into a ditch and Mairesse&#x27;s car landed upside down and caught fire. Both drivers were thrown out of their cars, but were unhurt.

* Dan Gurney practiced in a Lotus-BRM owned by Wolfgang Seidel, but after a few laps he deemed the car unraceworthy. Gurney was also entered by the works Porsche team, along with Jo Bonnier, but the team withdrew after the factory was hit by strike action.
* The #4 entry was originally allocated to Lewis, then to Ashmore on Lewis&#x27; withdrawal. After Ashmore also withdrew, the slot was filled by John Campbell-Jones.
* Lucien Bianchi was originally entered as #14, in a Porsche prepared by Scuderia SSS Republica di Venezia, but withdrew. He later took #19 and drove Equipe National Belge&#x27;s Lotus.

<text>The 1962 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Rouen-Les-Essarts on 8 July 1962. It was race 4 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Dan Gurney, his first Formula One victory, driving a Porsche, that company&#x27;s only win as a constructor in a Formula One championship race coming after three years of racing. It was the third time that the French Grand Prix was held at Rouen, the previous time being 1957.

==Race==
Phil Hill, running second in the championship, was in the stands with a camera around his neck; a metalworkers&#x27; strike in Italy meant that Ferrari could not take part. This left Graham Hill the fastest on track, taking the lead at the start and also setting a new lap record. The leading pack also included John Surtees (Lola), Jim Clark (Lotus), and Bruce McLaren (Cooper). These four pulled steadily away from Jack Brabham (Lotus) and Dan Gurney (Porsche). After only nine laps Brabham was out of the race with a broken rear suspension, while McLaren lost fourth gear and spun off the track, rejoining the race far down the field. Surtees retired four laps later with ignition problems, but was later back on the track in eighth place. Hill had pulled out a twenty-second lead ahead of Clark, but on the thirtieth lap he made contact with Jackie Lewis&#x27; Cooper when lapping him, allowing Clark to pass. Hill gave chase, netting the lap record, and re-took the lead on lap 33. On the next lap, Clark retired with a broken front suspension. Hill and BRM looked sure to win, but on lap 42 he retired in the hairpin with fuel injection and throttle linkage troubles; he lost several laps and ended up in last place after also having stopped in the hairpin to pick up the engine cover that he had left behind during his earlier visit there.

All of a sudden Gurney found himself in the lead, he made no mistakes and gained what was to be Porsche&#x27;s only Grand Prix victory with their own car. Tony Maggs had second-place handed to him in what was only his second race in a V8 Cooper, while Surtees&#x27; Lola kept giving him trouble. With only fourth gear left, he was passed by Richie Ginther on the 43rd lap. Ginther&#x27;s car had refused to start, setting him a half lap back at the start, but as cars ahead of him all began to break he drove harder and harder. His troubles were not over, however, with five laps left his throttle wire snapped and he had to control it with his hand - rather troublesome since his BRM&#x27;s gear shifter was also on the right hand side. McLaren was forced to make another pit stop, but managed to get by the troubled Surtees on the last lap. The last points-scoring position went to the ever-steady Carel Godin de Beaufort in his uncompetitive Porsche 718 from 1961.

Other contenders were Jo Bonnier, who had gearbox and engine troubles. He later retired with fuel starvation, but got the car started and was classified as the last finisher, in tenth. Maurice Trintignant had to make a number of pit stops in his Rob Walker Lotus 24. Trevor Taylor had not been able to practice and was taking it comparatively easy when his throttle return spring broke, leaving it fully open. After a pit stop, he finished eighth, six laps down. A rather confusing race ended even worse - Surtees was trying to eke his crippled car into the pits but was hindered by a wall of gendarmes, who were refusing to move. Trintignant moved over to the left, but Taylor arrived at a high speed and rear-ended Trintignant. Both cars ended up in the hay bales, badly damaged, but amazingly no one was injured.

At the end, Phil Hill took his countryman Gurney aside and thanked him for &quot;driving so well for him&quot;, as both of his closest competitors ended the race without any points.

<text>The 1962 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Aintree on 21 July 1962. It was race 5 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. This was the last race at Aintree. From 1963 onwards, the race would be held at Silverstone or Brands Hatch. Scotsman Jim Clark dominated the race, driving a Lotus 25. It was considered a power track, benefitting the light and powerful Lotus and Lola cars in particular. Ferrari were still sidelined due to the Italian metal workers&#x27; strike but managed to send one car for Phil Hill.

==Race==
It was not a particularly exciting race, with Clark leading from start to finish and fairly large gaps between the cars. Out of the twentyone starters, six still had four-cylinder engines while the rest were multi-cylinder cars. These cars were in a sort of class of their own, with Jackie Lewis finishing best of the four-cylinder cars. John Surtees&#x27; Lola started and finished in second place, in spite of having lost second gear on the tenth lap. Dan Gurney was hopeful after winning in France and at the non-championship Solitude race in the preceding two weeks. He began the race in third but had a slipping clutch and slid steadily down the field, ending in ninth position. His teammate Jo Bonnier had to retire with a broken transmission. Bruce McLaren (Cooper) passed Gurney after twelve laps and finished in third. Graham Hill pushed his BRM hard but had to settle for fourth, and was threatened by Jack Brabham in the closing stages. Brabham, however, had burns on his right foot since lap 40 and was in a lot of pain. He finished fifth, ahead of Tony Maggs&#x27; Cooper. Brabham had hoped to start in his own car after his mechanics had worked days and nights, but at 3 am the morning before the race it was discovered that they had been supplied with the wrong exhaust system. The Brabham BT3 had to wait until Nürburgring two weeks later to make its first appearance.

Innes Ireland had perhaps the day&#x27;s biggest disappointment. After having qualified his Climax-engined UDT/Laystall Lotus 24 on the first row, the gear shifter bent on his first lap, leaving him with only three gears. He had to pit immediately after start and finished last, after having spent several laps repairing the car. Trevor Taylor was anxious to have a good race after several recent collisions and started well. Soon, however, he had to pit with a loose carburettor, and only managed an eighth place in his Lotus 24. Phil Hill&#x27;s Ferrari, meanwhile, was totally outclassed by the British cars in spite of its new six-speed gearbox. He never ran higher than tenth and had to retire with ignition troubles.

<text>The 1962 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Nürburgring on 5 August 1962. It was race 6 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 15-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill after he started from second position. John Surtees finished second for the Lola team and Porsche driver Dan Gurney came in third. The race was notable for having six different constructors taking the first six positions.

==Race==
After a heavy midday downpour, the race was delayed by over an hour as streams of water and mud covered parts of the track. It never dried fully, and the race was run in wet conditions. Graham Hill drove masterfully in the wet conditions, followed by John Surtees who was gradually proving himself a great driver. He reached third position in the championship with this race, but was not to score any more points in 1962. Dan Gurney&#x27;s Porsche had less than impressive handling but he finished third after passing Phil Hill, whose Ferrari was doing much better than at Aintree just 2 weeks prior. Hill, however, had to pit with oil on his visor and retired with a broken rear suspension soon thereafter. After a disastrous strike had kept them out of the last two races, Ferrari returned in force with four 156s built to different specifications. Hill had the newest version, with a six-speed transmission mounted fore of the engine. Giancarlo Baghetti drove a car with the usual transmission and finished tenth, whereas Ricardo Rodríguez drove last year&#x27;s model with the 65 degree Tipo 188 engine - and got the best result of the team, finishing sixth. Lorenzo Bandini used a development car, with a regular nosecone, smaller radiator, and modified front and rear suspension. He crashed on the third lap, while in eleventh position.

Jim Clark absentmindedly forgot to turn on the fuel pump at the start, losing thirteen seconds and being in 26th place after the start. A rapid climb began, and he passed seventeen cars on the opening lap. He was closing in to the leaders with three to four seconds per lap, but after a few near crashes in the middle of the race he chose to ease off the pace a bit. Clark finished fourth, ahead of Bruce McLaren in a V8 Cooper. The other V8-engined Cooper was driven in practice by Tony Maggs, but a German TV-company&#x27;s camera fell off Carel Godin de Beaufort&#x27;s Porsche in practice, causing Graham Hill and Maggs to crash and total their cars. Maggs ran a Climax-engined backup car and finished ninth. The Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association&#x27;s policy was to not carry cameras due to the safety risks, but de Beaufort was not a member.

Three new cars appeared in this race; the new BRM V8-engined Gilby, driven by Keith Greene, retired after about half the race with gearbox problems. The Belgian Maserati-engined ENB finished last; this car was a hodgepodge of parts from three old Emerysons equipped with a sharknose-style front end. This was its only appearance, and a hard worked Lucien Bianchi was only allowed to start thanks to the fact that several faster racers had not finished the minimum-required five laps. Gurney&#x27;s fastest qualifying lap was 8:47.2; the ENB&#x27;s fastest lap was 10:40.7, nearly two minutes slower. Most importantly, Jack Brabham&#x27;s new BT3 finally appeared after a marathon effort by his mechanics. He spun the main bearings on the first day practice, and qualified with an engine built using parts from Trevor Taylor&#x27;s car (his engine bent a valve). He started the race from the rear of the field, with the Climax engine from his Lotus 24. He climbed to ninth place by the end of the first lap, but then his throttle broke and he had to retire after nine laps. Nonetheless, Brabham was happy with the car, particularly the handling.

;Notes
* – Four drivers were not allowed to start, as race organisers deemed they had not completed sufficient laps in practice. Trevor Taylor was eventually allowed, but was demoted to the back of the field.
* † – Maggs switched from his V8 primary machine to a four-cylinder back-up car after a crash during the second practice. His time during the third practice session was the only one that counted towards the grid.

== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for Swiss driver Heini Walter and German driver Günther Seiffert.
* Dan Gurney achieved his first pole position; it was also the first for Porsche - both as a constructor and as an engine supplier.
* Jack Brabham debuted with a car of his own making, as Brabham made its debut in the Formula One World Championship.
* ENB also made its debut in this race, being the first Belgian constructor in Formula One World Championship history.

<text>The 1962 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 16 September 1962. It was race 7 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 86-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill after he started from second position. His teammate Richie Ginther finished second and Cooper driver Bruce McLaren came in third.

==Race report==
Jim Clark started on pole position, but the Lotus team still looked worried as the team had gone through all of their gearboxes over the weekend. Two crates of spare parts were flown down, but nonetheless Clark and Trevor Taylor started with no more spares available. After only two laps Clark pitted with the expected transmission trouble; he made it back onto the track for another ten laps but that was it. Teammate Taylor managed 25 laps before his race ended. Hill kept stretching his lead out and finished nearly a half minute before Richie Ginther in the other BRM. Ginther had been duelling with Surtees throughout the race, but on lap 38 Surtees slowed down and five laps later he retired with engine troubles. Behind these two, there was a race long three-way fight between Dan Gurney&#x27;s Porsche and the Coopers of McLaren and Maggs. The cars swapped positions constantly, coming down the straight on the fiftieth lap three abreast. Maggs had to stop for more fuel, unlike McLaren whose car had been fitted with fuel tanks to enable him to run the entire distance. Meanwhile, Willy Mairesse in the new non-sharknose Ferrari 156 had caught up to the third-place contenders and brought Jo Bonnier and Giancarlo Baghetti with him.

Gurney&#x27;s car was pressed too hard and he retired on the 66th lap with a broken rear differential. After this, the positions stabilized a bit, although not until after Baghetti had briefly led the pack to the appreciation of local fans. Bonnier&#x27;s clutch began slipping and Baghetti also fell back. Mairesse took third on the eightieth lap, and built up a three-second lead over McLaren. Stirling Moss, who was watching from the speaker tower, began betting people that McLaren would take third and he was right: in the first curve of the last lap, McLaren passed Mairesse and he took third by only 0.4 seconds. Bonnier&#x27;s clutch troubles allowed Baghetti to pass him for fifth place near the end of the race. Phil Hill had to suffer being lapped before half of the race was over, and had to make a long pit stop with engine troubles and finished twelfth. Rodríguez&#x27; Ferrari lost oil pressure, Innes Ireland had a good race until something snapped in the steering, and Masten Gregory&#x27;s car was overheating and then only ran in fourth gear for the last laps. The fire extinguisher in Roy Salvadori&#x27;s Bowmaker-Yeoman Lola exploded in his face during practice.

<text>The 1962 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 7, 1962, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 8 of 9 in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 100-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after starting from pole position. Graham Hill finished second for the BRM team and Cooper driver Bruce McLaren came in third.

==Summary==
New Lotus star Jim Clark of Scotland took his third victory of the season, and the third of his career, to keep alive his hopes of catching Graham Hill for the 1962 World Driver&#x27;s Championship with one race remaining. Hill finished nine seconds back in second place for BRM, while Bruce McLaren was third, despite being a lap down.

For the third consecutive year, Ferrari had decided not to make the trip across the Atlantic for the American race. It had been a miserable year for the team, finishing sixth in the eight-team Constructor&#x27;s Championship (without a victory), after winning it the year before. The powerful new V8 engines built by Climax and BRM for the second year of the 1.5-liter formula had taken the series by storm, and Ferrari&#x27;s advantage from had been completely erased.

Also, as a result, American Phil Hill was again without a drive in his home country, and, worse yet, he learned from a reliable source at The Glen that he had been fired.

In Friday&#x27;s qualifying session, Graham Hill, Hill&#x27;s BRM teammate Richie Ginther, Clark and Jack Brabham (using his own BT3 model for just the second time) all bettered the previous year&#x27;s lap record of 1:18.2. Clark then went out and shattered the absolute course record, set under the 2.5-liter formula by Stirling Moss, with a staggering 1:15.8. Damp and misty conditions on Saturday prohibited anyone improving their Friday time, so the top six were Clark in the Lotus, Ginther and Hill&#x27;s BRM&#x27;s, American Dan Gurney in a Porsche, Brabham, and McLaren&#x27;s Cooper.

By race time on Sunday, there were 40,000 fans braving the cold winds and a threat of rain. At the start, Clark led off the grid, while Hill jumped into second behind him. With Ginther, Brabham, Gurney and McLaren following, the two Championship rivals pulled away, already lowering the F1 track record on lap 3. Gurney got by Brabham and Ginther and briefly took third place, but on lap 11, Ginther retook the spot behind his teammate when Gurney slid half off the track, inches from the Armco, on a patch of oil in the Loop.

On lap 12, the two leaders were already coming up to lap the tail-enders. When Clark was delayed in the traffic, Hill took the lead away from him. By lap 19, however, Clark had lowered the lap record to 1:15.4, well under his qualifying time, and retaken the lead for good. Ginther was struggling with a deteriorating gearbox and began to fall back until a missed shift on lap 35 blew the engine and ended a fine run.

As Clark continued comfortably ahead of Hill, McLaren was now hounding Gurney for third place. The New Zealander&#x27;s Cooper slid by on lap 57, and soon after, Gurney began losing power in the Porsche&#x27;s engine. Brabham closed the gap between them, and when he grabbed fourth place from the American on lap 69, he claimed the first Championship points ever scored by the Brabham make.

Clark and Hill were the only cars on the lead lap toward the end as both lapped repeatedly under their grid times. Clark eventually clocked a 1:15.0 on lap 70 for the fastest lap of the race, and eased off from his biggest lead of 17 seconds to take the second consecutive American Grand Prix win for Team Lotus. &quot;I planned to get in front and stay there,&quot; Clark said. &quot;I set up the car for dry weather just before we started. I sure am glad the weather held up!&quot; Indeed, moments after the Scot had taken the checkered flag, a drizzle began to fall.

<text>The 1962 South African Grand Prix, formally titled the 9th International RAC Grand Prix of South Africa, was a Formula One motor race held at East London on 29 December 1962. It was the ninth and final race in both the 1962 World Championship of Drivers and the 1962 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 82-lap race was won by Graham Hill driving a BRM, the Englishman taking his first Drivers&#x27; Championship in the process, with New Zealander Bruce McLaren and local driver Tony Maggs second and third, respectively, in works Cooper-Climaxes.

Hill went into the race with a nine-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship over Scotland&#x27;s Jim Clark, driving a works Lotus-Climax. A Clark win would give him the championship regardless of Hill&#x27;s performance because only the top 5 results counted for the championship. After taking pole position, Clark led comfortably until an oil leak 20 laps from the finish forced him to retire, handing the championship to Hill. The win also gave BRM their first and only Manufacturers&#x27; Cup.
