==Personal life==
Harrison&#x27;s son, Marvin Harrison Jr., is an NFL wide receiver. He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and was drafted in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft, 4th overall, by the Arizona Cardinals.

===Legal issues===
Harrison was sued in a civil lawsuit by Dwight Dixon, a convicted drug dealer, after Dixon was shot outside Chuckie&#x27;s Garage, a North Philadelphia business owned by Harrison, on April 29, 2008. The two men had been in a fight minutes prior to the shooting over something that happened a few weeks earlier when Dixon and Harrison got into a verbal argument after Harrison denied Dixon entry into Playmakers, a sports bar owned and operated by Harrison. Dixon alleged that Harrison was the gunman who shot at him. On January 6, 2009, Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham confirmed the gun that fired shots at Dixon was the same model as Harrison&#x27;s gun but said they had been unable to determine who pulled the trigger.

Abraham also said that she was not going to pursue charges in the case due to conflicting witness statements. In fact, within a week of the first shooting, Marvin Harrison was not considered a suspect. Dixon, who had initially given the police a false name and claimed he was robbed by two men when interviewed at the hospital, was then convicted of filing a false report for the incident on January 28, 2009. Dixon was sentenced to six months probation. His attorney reportedly sought a new trial; the conviction violated Dixon&#x27;s parole in an unrelated case. Harrison was also sued by Robert Nixon, a victim who was caught in the crossfire of the shooting who identified Harrison as the shooter in a statement to the police.

Dixon died on July 21, 2009, after he was shot several times while he was in his car outside a building two blocks away from the sports bar. At the hospital after the shooting, detectives questioned Dixon before surgery. He asserted that it stemmed from the Harrison incident a year prior and that Harrison had hired a gunman to shoot him. An informant also made a statement to the effect that the gunman who killed Dixon was Lonnie Harrison, Marvin Harrison&#x27;s cousin. On June 16, 2010, Shaun Assael of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; reported that police confiscated a 9mm handgun from Harrison during a routine traffic stop on Wednesday in Philadelphia. They tested the gun to see if it matched three spent 9mm shell casings found inside the truck driven by Dwight Dixon at the scene of an April 2008 shooting. Dixon&#x27;s claim, he was now deceased, was that the casings came from a second gun which Marvin Harrison fired. Authorities had already matched other bullets to a separate gun which Harrison owns—which he claimed was in his home on the day of the shooting. The police found the gun during a search of Harrison&#x27;s Escalade. Harrison was stopped as he was driving the wrong way on a one-way street.

Harrison claimed he did not have a gun. But the police believed that they saw Harrison put what appeared to be a weapon in the center console between the two front seats. They concluded that they had probable cause to search the vehicle and they found the gun; however, Harrison was not charged. 

Another incident occurred in 2014 when Harrison narrowly escaped a Philadelphia shooting.

<doc id="1125528" wikidata="Q798003" url="?curid=1125528" title="Swordquest">
<text>Swordquest is a series of video games originally produced by Atari, Inc. in the 1980s as part of a contest, consisting of three finished games, Earthworld, Fireworld and Waterworld (with these titles occasionally appearing on cartridge labels and boxes with capitalized central Ws, e.g. EarthWorld), and a planned fourth game, Airworld.

== About ==
Each of the games came with a comic book that explained the plot, as well as containing part of the solution to a major puzzle that had to be solved to win the contest, with a series of prizes whose total value was $150,000. The series had its genesis as a possible sequel to Atari&#x27;s groundbreaking 1979 title &quot;Adventure&quot;, but it developed mythology and a system of play that was unique.

The comic books were produced by DC Comics, written by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, and drawn and inked by George Pérez and Dick Giordano. All three game box covers were illustrated by an Atari in-house illustrator, Warren Chang. A special fan club offer was provided, allowing those who wanted the game to also get a T-shirt and poster for each game.

The games of the Swordquest series (along with Atari 2600 &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;) were some of the earliest attempts to combine the narrative and logic elements of the adventure game genre with the twitch gameplay of the action genre, making them some of the first action-adventure games. However, due to Atari&#x27;s financial problems related to the video game crash of 1983, the last contest along with the grand finale contest were never held and the final game in the series, &quot;Airworld&quot; was not released. As such the contest was never completed and the current unknown fate of some of the prizes has become an urban legend in the gaming community.

As part of &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot;, a collection of Atari games for its 50th anniversary in 2022, Digital Eclipse created a version of &quot;Airworld&quot; that completes the &quot;Swordquest&quot; series.

== Gameplay ==
Each game of the &quot;Swordquest&quot; series was themed after the classical elements: earth, fire, water, and air. Each game required the player to move through a maze of rooms, collecting objects from one and placing them in other rooms. The arrangement or theme of the rooms varied with each game: &quot;Earthworld&quot; was themed after the Western zodiac, &quot;Fireworld&quot; after the Kabbalah tree of life, &quot;Waterworld&quot; after the chakras, and &quot;Airworld&quot; was to have been modeled after the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Traversing between rooms sometimes required the player to complete a &quot;twitch&quot;-style minigame to progress. When the player placed an item in its correct room, they would be presented with numerical clues that referred to a page and panel within the comic that was packaged with the game. There, the player would find a hidden word that was part of the larger &quot;Swordquest&quot; contest, as by submitting all the correct words in the correct order to Atari, they would be entered into the next phase of the project. The discovered words would form a relevant phrase towards the larger contest. In at least two cases, for &quot;Earthworld&quot; and &quot;Fireworld&quot;, there were more clues indicated by the game than required to be submitted. Players also had to identify a second clue in the game&#x27;s instruction manual (for &quot;Earthworld&quot;, indicating prime numbers to use only clues on prime numbered pages) to know which clues to send in.

==Plot==
The games follow twins named Tarra and Torr. Their parents were slain by King Tyrannus&#x27;s guards, prompted by a prophecy by the king&#x27;s wizard Konjuro that the twins would slay Tyrannus. The twins were then raised as commoners by thieves to avoid being slain by the king. When they go to plunder Konjuro&#x27;s sea keep, they accidentally reveal their identities to him. The twins then start running from a demon summoned to kill them, but it appears that a jewel they stole attracts it. After smashing the stone to avoid the demon, two of Tyrannus&#x27;s old advisers appear and tell the two about the &quot;Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&quot; and the &quot;Talisman of Penultimate Truth.&quot; They are then transported to Earthworld.

After defeating many beasts of the Zodiac and another thief (Herminus) in Earthworld, the twins are transported to the &quot;central chamber&quot; where the &quot;Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&quot; and the &quot;Talisman of Penultimate Truth&quot; are kept. Upon reaching them, the sword burns a hole through its altar all the way to Fireworld. In Fireworld, the twins split up to look for water, and Torr, with the aid of the talisman, summons Mentorr who shows Torr the &quot;Chalice of Light,&quot; which will quench his thirst. The twins reunite eventually and find the chalice. However, Torr drops it after he is startled, and it is revealed that the one they found was not the &quot;true&quot; chalice. Herminus then gives them the chalice, and it grows until it becomes large enough to swallow the twins and transports them to Waterworld.

Upon reaching Waterworld, the twins become separated. Konjuro casts a spell that causes the twins to lose their memories. Tarra travels to a ship made of ice and meets Cap&#x27;n Frost, who desires to find the &quot;Crown of Life&quot; and rule Waterworld. Meanwhile, Torr travels to an undersea kingdom and meets the city&#x27;s ex-queen Aquana, who desires to find the &quot;Crown of Life&quot; in order to regain her throne. After a brief war between the ex-queen and captain, Herminus sets the twins to duel each other. They then pray to their deities for guidance, which summons Mentorr who allows them to regain their memories. The twins throw down their swords, causing the crown to be revealed and split in half. The halves are given to the ex-queen and the captain, who then rule as equals. The &quot;Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&quot; then transports the twins to Airworld where they would have to do battle with King Tyrannus and Konjuro.

While the comic for &quot;Airworld&quot; was started, the cancellation of the series left the comic unfinished.

== Development ==
The concept of &quot;Swordquest&quot; originated from Atari&#x27;s previous &quot;Adventure&quot; video game, which is notable for one of the first documented Easter eggs. &quot;Adventure&quot; drew more interest once the Easter egg was found and documented, leading Atari to come up with a type of sequel where &quot;marketing thought it would be a great idea to create a series of games where players would have to find clues both in the game [and in its physical materials]&quot;, as described by Atari historian Curt Vendel. As Atari was owned by Warner Communications at this point, they were able to use two of Warner&#x27;s subsidiaries to help with this contest. DC Comics was used to create the comic book that would help create the setting where the word clues would be hidden, written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas and illustrated by George Pérez. The Franklin Mint crafted the game&#x27;s prizes. The games themselves were programmed by Tod Frye.

=== Contest ===
Atari had designed the &quot;Swordquest&quot; contest to award a winner for each of the four games. For each game, they had planned to bring all winners to the Atari headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, to race to complete a specially-programmed version of that game to be the first to finish it. The person with the fastest completion would be named the winner and be awarded a &quot;treasure&quot;, produced by Franklin Mint, each valued at around at the time of &quot;Swordquest&quot;″s release. The prizes were:
* &quot;Earthworld&quot;: The &quot;Talisman of Penultimate Truth&quot;, an 18-karat solid gold disc studded with 12 diamonds, the birthstones of the 12 Zodiac signs and a miniature white gold sword set atop it.
* &quot;Fireworld&quot;: The &quot;Chalice of Light&quot;, a goblet made of platinum and gold studded with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and green jade.
* &quot;Waterworld&quot;: The &quot;Crown of Life&quot;, a solid gold crown decorated with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and aquamarines.
* &quot;Airworld&quot;: The &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, a large piece of white jade encased in an 18-karat gold box encrusted with emeralds, rubies, and diamonds.
The four winners would then have competed in a final contest to win the ultimate prize, &quot;The Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&quot; with a silver blade and an 18-carat gold handle covered with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and rubies, that was valued at 

For &quot;Earthworld&quot;, about 5000 entries were received, but only eight answered correctly. The contest was held in May 1983, with Stephen Bell winning the Talisman. For &quot;Fireworld&quot;, Atari received several more entries, with 73 of these being correct. For practicality, Atari required the 73 finalists to write a brief essay of what they liked about the game, selecting the top 50 replies to continue to the final competition, held in January 1984. This was won by Michael Rideout, who was awarded the Chalice.

At this point in time, Atari had suffered major financial setbacks due to the 1983 video game crash. Atari was further in the midst of dealing with fallout from an insider trading scandal by former CEO Ray Kassar; Kassar was replaced by James J. Morgan in mid-1983, and looking to cut financial losses, eventually cancelled the &quot;Swordquest&quot; project, despite work having already started on &quot;Airworld&quot;. However, because the company had already advertised the availability of the &quot;Waterworld&quot; contest, Atari&#x27;s lawyers required the company to continue the contest. To limit the number of entries, &quot;Waterworld&quot; was only made available to members of the Atari Club. During the contest period, in mid-1984, Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel, the owner of Commodore International. Tramiel, who had been more focused on the success of home computers than gaming consoles, placed the Atari divisions in a new company, Tramel Technology, and reviewed the state of all divisions, furthering the troubles in completing the &quot;Waterworld&quot; contest. Most who did enter the &quot;Waterworld&quot; contest were told they did not qualify for the final, but according to Vendel, Atari was legally required to follow through as advertised on the &quot;Waterworld&quot; contest. Vendel stated that Atari did secretly invite those with correct entries to hold the final round, and the Crown was awarded to a person, their name remaining anonymous due to legal requirements. Because they could not hold the ultimate final round, Bell and Rideout were both awarded an additional as well as an Atari 7800 as a compensation prize, and granting the ten finalists of &quot;Waterworld&quot; each.

The fate of the prizes has become an urban legend in the gaming community since the cancellation of the project. Of the five treasures, Rideout has claimed, as recently as 2017, that he still has the Chalice in his possession, stored in a safe deposit box. Bell fell out of contact following the &quot;Swordquest&quot; event, but according to Vendel and Rideout, Bell appeared to have had the disc part of the Talisman melted down for its value (about at the time), keeping the small sword, diamonds, and birthstones; the current fate of these is unknown. The fate of the Crown is unknown; Vendel stated that while Atari was required to hold the contest, they could have simply awarded the winner with a cash prize equivalent as opposed to the Crown.

Since they were never part of any contest, the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone and the Sword have seemingly disappeared. Some sources have claimed that Tramiel took possession of the prizes himself, based on rumoured observations that Atari staff or associates of Tramiel had made of seeing a similar looking sword mounted in Tramiel&#x27;s office or on his home mantel. However, Vendel believes that the persons who started this rumor may have mistaken a Tramiel family heirloom for the &quot;Swordquest&quot; sword. Vendel believes that it is unlikely that Tramiel would have been able to keep the Stone, Sword, and (if not given away) Crown, as when Atari, Inc was sold, these items were still the property of Warner Communications, and would have been returned to the Franklin Mint. With the Franklin Mint later being sold in 1985 to American Protective Services, and the original Atari business no longer existing, the prizes were most likely melted back down to their base components for reuse elsewhere, according to Vendel.

On June 29, 2022, Atari announced that as part of the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; collection, that the Digital Eclipse team had created the fourth and final entry in the Swordquest series, Airworld. &quot;Atari 50&quot; was released on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in November 2022.

==Comic books==
===Original mini-comics===
Each of the three released games shipped with a comic book, published jointly by Atari and DC Comics. The books included clues to solve the puzzles within each of the games.

===Dynamite Entertainment mini-series===
In February 2017, Dynamite Entertainment announced a new comic book series, called &quot;Swordquest&quot;, but based on the actual contest around the three games, rather than the story within the games. It was a six-issue series, starting with a special #0 &quot;Preview&quot; book that sold with a cover price of 25¢ and was published in May 2017. The remaining 5 issues, published monthly after the preview, sold at $3.99 each. In addition, Dynamite released a trade paperback that reprinted the three mini-comics along with the mini-comic for the game &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot;. As with the originals, the TPB is sized as a mini-comic.

The series featured the story of a person who had played the three &quot;Swordquest&quot; games (with help from two friends who were brother and sister) when he was younger and was anticipating &quot;Airworld&quot;. Now as an adult, he continues his efforts to play &quot;Airworld&quot; using his old Atari hardware, but is caught up with a mysterious figure who offers to help him obtain the real &quot;Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&quot; from its resting place in the World Arcade Museum. As well as being valuable, it may have its own mysterious powers. The man contacts his two childhood friends to accompany him on his new &quot;Swordquest&quot;.

The comic was written by Chad Bowers and Chris Sims and had art by Scott Kowalchuk under the pseudonym &quot;Ghostwriter X&quot;. A trade paperback reprint of all six issues, titled &quot;Swordquest: Realworld&quot; was released in February 2018.

==Reception==
Richard A. Edwards reviewed &quot;Swordquest: Earthworld&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 61. Edwards commented that &quot;The only reason to purchase a copy of &quot;Swordquest: Earthworld&quot; is to try and solve the puzzle and win the prize. Gamers not interested in spending the time required should pass this one.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Swordquest: Earthworld&quot; 71st on their Top 100 Video Games.

==In popular culture==
Both the novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and the film adaptation reference the &quot;Swordquest&quot; series.

<doc id="1125543" wikidata="Q370387" url="?curid=1125543" title="Mercury-vapor lamp">
<text>A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas-discharge lamp that uses an electric arc through vaporized mercury to produce light. The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger soda lime or borosilicate glass bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor; in either case, the outer bulb provides thermal insulation, protection from the ultraviolet radiation the light produces, and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube.

Mercury-vapor lamps are more energy efficient than incandescent lamps with luminous efficacies of 35 to 55 lumens/watt. Their other advantages are a long bulb lifetime in the range of 24,000 hours and a high-intensity light output. For these reasons, they are used for large area overhead lighting, such as in factories, warehouses, and sports arenas as well as for streetlights. Clear mercury lamps produce a greenish light due to mercury&#x27;s combination of spectral lines. This is not flattering to human skin color, so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores. &quot;Color corrected&quot; mercury bulbs overcome this problem with a phosphor on the inside of the outer bulb that emits at the red wavelengths, offering whiter light and better color rendition.

Mercury-vapor lights operate at an internal pressure of around one atmosphere and require special fixtures, as well as an electrical ballast. They also require a warm-up period of four to seven minutes to reach full light output. Mercury-vapor lamps are becoming obsolete due to the higher efficiency and better color balance of metal halide lamps.

==Origins==
Charles Wheatstone observed the spectrum of an electric discharge in mercury vapor in 1835, and noted the ultraviolet lines in that spectrum. In 1860, John Thomas Way used arc lamps operated in a mixture of air and mercury vapor at atmospheric pressure for lighting. The German physicist Leo Arons (1860–1919) studied mercury discharges in 1892 and developed a lamp based on a mercury arc. In February 1896 Herbert John Dowsing and H. S. Keating of England patented a mercury-vapor lamp, considered by some to be the first true mercury-vapor lamp.

The first mercury-vapor lamp to achieve widespread success was invented in 1901 by American engineer Peter Cooper Hewitt. Hewitt was issued on September 17, 1901. In 1903, Hewitt created an improved version that possessed more satisfactory color qualities which eventually found widespread industrial use. The ultraviolet light from mercury-vapor lamps was applied to water treatment by 1910. The Hewitt lamps used a large amount of mercury. In the 1930s, improved lamps of the modern form, developed by the Osram-GEC company, General Electric company and others led to widespread use of mercury-vapor lamps for general lighting.

==Principle of operation==

The mercury in the tube is a liquid at normal temperatures. It needs to be vaporized and ionized before the lamp can produce its full light output. To facilitate starting of the lamp, a third electrode is mounted near one of the main electrodes and connected through a resistor to the other main electrode. In addition to the mercury, the tube is filled with argon gas at low pressure. When power is applied, if there is sufficient voltage to ionize the argon, the ionized argon gas will strike a small arc between the starting electrode and the adjacent main electrode. As the ionized argon conducts, the heat from its arc vaporizes the liquid mercury; next, the voltage between the two main electrodes will ionize the mercury gas. An arc initiates between the two main electrodes and the lamp will then radiate mainly in the ultraviolet, violet and blue emission lines. Continued vaporization of the liquid mercury increases the arc tube pressure to between 2 and 18 bar, depending on lamp size. The increase in pressure results in further brightening of the lamp. The entire warm-up process takes roughly 4 to 7 minutes. Some bulbs include a thermal switch which shorts the starting electrode to the adjacent main electrode, extinguishing the starting arc once the main arc strikes.

The mercury-vapor lamp is a negative resistance device. This means its resistance decreases as the current through the tube increases. So if the lamp is connected directly to a constant-voltage source like the power lines, the current through it will increase until it destroys itself. Therefore, it requires a ballast to limit the current through it. Mercury-vapor lamp ballasts are similar to the ballasts used with fluorescent lamps. In fact, the first British fluorescent lamps were designed to operate from 80-watt mercury-vapor ballasts. There are also self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps available. These lamps use a tungsten filament in series with the arc tube both to act as a resistive ballast and add full spectrum light to that of the arc tube. Self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps can be screwed into a standard incandescent light socket supplied with the proper voltage.

===Metal halide===
A very closely related lamp design called the metal halide lamp uses various compounds in the form of metal halides with the mercury. Sodium iodide and scandium iodide are commonly in use. These lamps can produce much better quality light without resorting to phosphors. If they use a starting electrode, there is always a thermal shorting switch to eliminate any electrical potential between the main electrode and the starting electrode once the lamp is lit. (This electrical potential in the presence of the halides can cause the failure of the glass/metal seal). More modern metal halide systems do not use a separate starting electrode; instead, the lamp is started using high voltage pulses as with high-pressure sodium vapor lamps.

===Self-ballasted lamps===
Self-ballasted (SB) lamps are mercury-vapor lamps with a tungsten filament inside connected in series with the arc tube that functions as an electrical ballast. This is the only kind of mercury-vapor lamp that can be connected directly to the mains without an external ballast. These lamps have only the same or slightly higher efficiency than incandescent lamps of similar size, but have a longer life. They give light immediately on startup, but usually need a few minutes to restrike if power has been interrupted. Because of the light emitted by the filament, they have slightly better color rendering properties than mercury-vapor lamps. Self-ballasted lamps are typically more expensive than a standard mercury-vapor lamp.

==Operation==

When a mercury-vapor lamp is first turned on, it will produce a dark blue glow because only a small amount of the mercury is ionized and the gas pressure in the arc tube is very low, so much of the light is produced in the ultraviolet mercury bands. As the main arc strikes and the gas heats up and increases in pressure, the light shifts into the visible range and the high gas pressure causes the mercury emission bands to broaden somewhat, producing a light that appears more white to the human eye, although it is still not a continuous spectrum. Even at full intensity, the light from a mercury-vapor lamp with no phosphors is distinctly bluish in color. The pressure in the quartz arc-tube rises to approximately one atmosphere once the bulb has reached its working temperature. If the discharge should be interrupted (e.g. by interruption of the electric supply), it is not possible for the lamp to restrike until the bulb cools enough for the pressure to fall considerably. The reason for a prolonged period of time before the lamp restrikes is to due the elevated pressure, which leads to higher breakdown voltage of the gas inside (voltage needed to start an arc – Paschen&#x27;s law), which is outside the capabilities of the ballast. Because of this, many mercury-vapor lamps have a secondary lamp to function as a backup light source until the mercury-vapor lamp can restrike. This lamp is usually a halogen lamp of near or equal brightness.

=== Electrical parameters ===

===Color considerations===

To correct the bluish tinge, many mercury-vapor lamps are coated on the inside of the outer bulb with a phosphor that converts some portion of the ultraviolet emissions into red light. This helps to fill in the otherwise very-deficient red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. These lamps are generally called &quot;color corrected&quot; lamps. Most modern mercury-vapor lamps have this coating. One of the original complaints against mercury-lights was they tended to make people look like &quot;bloodless corpses&quot; because of the lack of light from the red end of the spectrum. A common method of correcting this problem before phosphors were used was to operate the mercury lamp in conjunction with an incandescent lamp. There is also an increase in red color (e.g., due to the continuous radiation) in ultra-high-pressure mercury-vapor lamps (usually greater than 200 atm.), which has found application in modern media projectors. When outside, coated or color corrected lamps can usually be identified by a blue &quot;halo&quot; around the light being given off.

===Emission line spectrum===
The strongest peaks of the emission line spectrum are


In low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps only the lines at 184 nm and 254 nm are present. Fused silica is used in the manufacturing to keep the 184 nm light from being absorbed. In medium-pressure mercury-vapor lamps, the lines from 200 to 600 nm are present. The lamps can be constructed to emit primarily in the UV-A (around 400 nm) or UV-C (around 250 nm). High-pressure mercury-vapor lamps are commonly used for general lighting purposes. They emit primarily in the blue and green.

==Ultraviolet cleaning==
Low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps usually have a quartz bulb in order to allow the transmission of short wavelength light. If synthetic quartz is used, then the transparency of the quartz is increased further and an emission line at 185 nm is observed also. Such a lamp can then be used for ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. The 185 nm line will create ozone in an oxygen containing atmosphere, which helps in the cleaning process, but is also a health hazard.

==Light pollution considerations==
For placements where light pollution is of prime importance (for example, an observatory parking lot), low-pressure sodium is preferred. As it emits narrow spectral lines at two very close wavelengths, it is the easiest to filter out. Mercury-vapor lamps without any phosphor are second best; they produce only a few distinct mercury lines that need to be filtered out.

==Bans==
In the EU the use of low efficiency mercury-vapor lamps for lighting purposes was banned in 2015. It does not affect the use of mercury in compact fluorescent lamp, nor the use of mercury lamps for purposes other than lighting.

In the US, ballasts for mercury-vapor lamps for general illumination, excluding specialty application mercury-vapor lamp ballasts, were banned after January 1, 2008. Because of this, several manufacturers have begun selling replacement compact fluorescent (CFL) and light emitting diode (LED) bulbs for mercury-vapor fixtures, which do not require modifications to the existing fixture. The US Department of Energy determined in 2015 that regulations proposed in 2010 for the mercury vapor type of HID lamps would not be implemented, because they would not yield substantial savings.

==Ultraviolet hazards==
The arctube of mercury lamps produces large amount of short wave UV-C radiation which can cause eye and skin burns. Usually the glass outer jacket of the lamp and in some lamps, also the phosphor coating, block this radiation. However, care should be taken if the outer jacket of the lamp breaks, because the arctube would continue to operate, presenting a safety hazard. There have been documented cases in the United States of lamps being damaged in gymnasiums by balls striking the lamps, resulting in sun burns and eye inflammation from shortwave ultraviolet radiation. When used in locations like gyms, the fixture should contain a strong outer guard or an outer lens to protect the lamp&#x27;s outer bulb. As a result of the said documented cases, some American manufacturers made &quot;safety&quot; lamps that will deliberately burn out if the outer glass is broken. This is usually achieved by using a thin tungsten strip, which will burn up in the presence of air, to connect one of the electrodes.

Typical mercury-vapor lamps with an outer envelope made of soda lime or borosilicate glass still allow a relatively large amount of 365 nm UV radiation to escape the lamp. This can cause the accelerated aging of some plastics used in the construction of luminaires, leaving them significantly discolored after only a few years&#x27; service. Polycarbonate suffers particularly from this problem and it is not uncommon to see fairly new polycarbonate surfaces positioned near the lamp to have turned a dull, yellow color after only a short time.

==Uses==

===Area and street lighting===
Although other types of HIDs are becoming more common, mercury-vapor lamps are still sometimes used for area lighting and street lighting in the United States, Canada and Japan.

===UV curing===
Mercury-vapor lamps are used in the printing industry to cure inks. These are typically high powered to rapidly cure and set the inks used. They are enclosed and have protections to prevent human exposure as well as specialised exhaust systems to remove the ozone generated.

===Molecular spectroscopy===
High-pressure mercury-vapor (and some specially-designed metal-halide) lamps find application in molecular spectroscopy due to providing useful broadband continuum (&quot;noise&quot;) energy at millimeter and terahertz wavelengths, owing to the high electron temperature of the arc plasma; the main UV emission line of ionized mercury (254 nm) correlates to a blackbody of T= 11,500 K. This property makes them among the very few simple, inexpensive sources available for generating such frequencies. For example, a standard 250-watt general-lighting mercury lamp produces significant output from 120 GHz to 6 THz. In addition, shorter wavelengths in the mid-infrared are emitted from the hot quartz arc-tube envelope. As with the ultraviolet output, the glass outer bulb is largely opaque at these frequencies and thus for this purpose needs to be removed (or omitted in purpose-made lamps).

=== Projection ===
Special ultra high-pressure mercury-vapor lamps called Ultra-high-performance lamps or UHP lamps, are commonly used in digital video projectors, including DLP, 3LCD and LCoS projectors.

<doc id="1125559" wikidata="Q7286133" url="?curid=1125559" title="Raji's">
<text>Raji&#x27;s was a rock and roll nightclub in central Hollywood, open in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was located in the Hastings Hotel building, 6160 Hollywood Blvd. The space had previously been occupied by a Greek restaurant called The King&#x27;s Palace.

It was one of the great sweaty, smoke-filled &#x27;dives&#x27; of rock. It featured performances by iconic bands such as Green Day, Guns N&#x27; Roses, The Flaming Lips, Heatmiser (which featured the late Elliott Smith), Redd Kross, Hole, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Thin White Rope, 45 Grave, Arab and The Suburban Turbans, The Untold Fables, The Dream Syndicate, The Lonesome Strangers, Snake Farm, The Billy Bremner Band, The Little Kings, The Shades, Tex &amp; the Horseheads, Lock-Up, Mary&#x27;s Danish, The Miracle Workers, Social Distortion, The Electric Ferrets, the Mentors, GG Allin, The Nymphs, Blackbird, Clay Idols and Los Lobos, as well as out-of-town acts like Nirvana (as seen on the cover of Nirvana&#x27;s 7&quot; single, &quot;Sliver&quot;), Pink Fairies, Pussy Galore, Mod Fun and Kyuss. Top-draw local acts like Thelonious Monster, The Muffs, the Red Aunts, The Lazy Cowgirls, Claw Hammer, Beck, Trash Can School, Pigmy Love Circus, Oiler, Kryptonite Nixon, Butt Trumpet, Kill Buddha, the Sacred Hearts, the Creamers, The Humpers, and many other underground music bands found enthusiastic crowds as well.

The club was also a hot spot for musicians, who would often come to watch bands and have drinks. Notable customers included Jonathan Richman, members of R.E.M., Top Jimmy, Gil T, and Carlos Guitarlos (of Top Jimmy &amp; The Rhythm Pigs), Billy Bremner of Rockpile, Nino Del Pesco (The Lonesome Strangers), Viki Peterson (of The Bangles), Texacala Jones or Mike Martt (of Tex &amp; the Horseheads), Bernie Bernstein (The Little Kings), Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers), Pope, Beck, Mike Savage (of Pigmy Love Circus), Texas Terri, and more with an inside few often invited to stay after hours to party with the infamous Danny &quot;Dobbs&quot; Wilson, founder and booker of the club, and his regular cast of characters which included Bernie the doorman, Autumn the bartender, floor security Clint, Tony T, Dirty Ed, The Pope and sound man Brian &quot;Up-stein&quot; Green.

One could see the likes of Dwarves, Spoon, Fishbone, My Other Side, Meat Puppets, Backbiter, Impatient Youth, Red River, Suplex Slam, The Red Devils/Blue Shadows, DC-3, Rage Against the Machine, Dumpster, Dead, White, and Blue, White Zombie, Haunted Garage, Pennywise, Green Day, The Reverend Horton Heat, Top Jimmy, X, The Muffs, Wetherbell, Texorcist, Circle One, The Gears, The D.I.&#x27;s, Adolescents, Dogstar, The Uninvited, The Superkools, Claw Hammer, Two Free Stooges, The Flesh Eaters, Continental Drifters, Kyuss, Buglamp, Cake, The Scraps, Two Bass Hit, The Marigolds, The Jack Brewer Band, The Melodiacs, and The Skulls, among countless others.

The venue sustained a lightning bolt gash near the bar due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The club continued to operate for three months after it was red tagged. A fire marshall shut the venue down for good and Larry Mann moved his operations to Hell&#x27;s Gate in the then, dangerous Yucca corridor. The building was demolished and is now a parking lot for the MTA.

The Ski Room, a bar located at 5851 Sunset Blvd., a few blocks away from the club&#x27;s former location, was renamed Raji&#x27;s and run by the same family that ran the club in its last two years, until 2004, when it closed due to the gentrification of central Hollywood.
It&#x27;s now called The Bar.

Danny &quot;Dobbs&quot; Wilson died in 2010.

Some scenes from Chris Cornell&#x27;s 1999 music video &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot; were shot at the club.

<doc id="1125569" wikidata="Q548268" url="?curid=1125569" title="Brockworth">
<text>Brockworth is a village and parish in the Borough of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England, situated on the old Roman road that connects the City of Gloucester with Barnwood. It is located southeast of central Gloucester, southwest of Cheltenham and north of Stroud. The population taken at the 2011 census was 7,387. The population increased to 9,422 at the 2021 Census.

Since the mid-20th century, Brockworth has been known locally for the annual rolling of Double Gloucester cheese down Cooper&#x27;s Hill. During World War II the nearby village of Hucclecote at the Gloster Aircraft Company produced the famous Hawker Hurricane fighter, and following the war it gained renewed fame for producing several notable aircraft, including Britain&#x27;s first jet aircraft, which was test flown here. Brockworth is also the birthplace of actor, comedian and writer Simon Pegg.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists in Tewkesbury Borough. The population and area of this ward are identical to that shown above.

Brockworth has a parish council.

==History==

The name Brockworth is derived from the Saxon name Brocwurthin, combining &quot;broc&quot; for brook and &quot;wurthin&quot; for enclosure. Settlement is believed to have occurred around 600 AD, after the defeat of the Gloucester-based Romano British at the Battle of Dyrham in 577 AD. Older, Roman remains have been found locally but they indicate an estate rather than a village. Also, the Saxon-derived name suggests that the first settlers were Saxons.

The oldest surviving building in the village is the Grade I listed building St George&#x27;s Church, which dates back to 1142. The present structure has elements from then until the nineteenth century. Adjacent to this is the Tudor manor house Brockworth Court, a Grade II* listed building, that was built between 1534 and 1539 for Richard Hart, the last prior of Llanthony Priory.

Brockworth was the third in a series of rural villages located along an old Roman road following a more-or-less straight line to the inland port city of Gloucester. Its original semi-remote location made it ideal for the location of an aircraft factory (now the Gloucester Business Park) where aeroplanes could be built and tested without worries about noise. Also, land availability made the area ideal for a flight test airfield.

===Gloster Aircraft Company===
The Gloster Aircraft Company was first formed at Hucclecote, Gloucestershire in 1915, as the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company. In 1926 the name of the company was abbreviated to Gloster Aircraft Company because customers outside of the United Kingdom found the original name too difficult to pronounce. In May 1934 the company was purchased by Hawker Aircraft but the company name was unchanged.

From 1921 the company produced the following aircraft types: Sparrowhawk, Nighthawk, Nightjar, Grouse, Grebe, Gamecock, Gorcock, Guan, Gambit, Gnatsnapper, Gauntlet, Gladiator, Hawker Hurricane; Hawker Typhoon; Gloster Meteor and Gloster Javelin and its runway became famous for the first flight of Sir Frank Whittle&#x27;s turbo-jet aircraft.

===Brockworth bombed===
The Gloster Aircraft Company (known locally as GAC) drew upon an employment pool from the surrounding area and it was responsible for much of the growth in the development of housing estates which was halted by the outbreak of World War II. During the war Brockworth and the surrounding area were bombed by the Luftwaffe in an attempt to halt the production of aircraft.

===1939–45 WWII production===
As the pre-war biplane Gladiator was rapidly rendered obsolete by faster monoplanes the Brockworth factory was available to manufacture Hawker aircraft. In 1939 the company built 1,000 Hawker Hurricanes in the first 12 months of World War II and it delivered the last of 2,750 Hurricanes in 1942. Production was then switched to building 3,330 Hawker Typhoons for the Royal Air Force. On 8 April 1941 the first test flight of the Gloster E28/39 with a single turbo-jet engine (invented by Sir Frank Whittle) took off from the company&#x27;s flight test airfield at Brockworth. This was followed by the twin-engined Gloster Meteor, the only jet to be used by the Allied Forces during World War II. The speed of the Meteor enabled it to fly alongside V1 flying bombs, tip them off course, to crash before they could arrive at their London target. In 1945 the Meteor gained a world speed record of and it was eventually put into service by 12 nations.

===Post-WWII developments===

Following World War II it took the area many years to revive; but after the mid-1950s, renewed housing growth, the development of motorways and redistricting eventually changed the entire look of Brockworth and what were once adjoining villages. In 1952 the Brockworth factory produced the two seat, delta-winged Gloster Javelin which was developed as an all weather fighter that could fly above 50,000 feet at almost the speed of sound. In 1962 the Gloster Aircraft Company closed down and its once famous runway fell victim of redistricting and it is now within the boundary of Hucclecote. The airfield has now been redeveloped as the modern Gloucester Business Park, with additional housing developments continuing to grow around it.

==Cooper&#x27;s Hill==

Cooper&#x27;s Hill () is a local landmark within the parish of Brockworth, which is long, and with a slope of around 50 per cent (26.6 degrees). It is known in Britain and beyond for its annual cheese rolling contest. A large round cheese is rolled down the steep slope of the hill and chased by a group of &quot;runners&quot;, who in fact spend most of their brief descent to the bottom of the hill falling and tumbling. Two hundred years ago this was part of a larger mid-summer festival with other activities and competitions, but the event is now confined to the cheese-rolling and is held in May during the Spring Bank-holiday Monday. It is usually said to have originated as a pagan festival celebrating the arrival of summer, fertility, or both.

The contest was the subject of the BBC One programme &quot;The Great Cheese Chase&quot; broadcast in 2018.

The Witcombe Festival was originally held at the bottom of Coopers Hill but since 2018 has been in Brockworth Road.

<text>The Caribbean Cup was a regional football competition for senior national teams from the Caribbean. It was organized by the [[Caribbean Football Union]] (CFU), the regional body for the Caribbean Zone under CONCACAF. The tournament was held from 1989 to 2017, as the direct successor competition of the CFU Championship and also served as a qualification method for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Trinidad and Tobago, eight-time champions, and Jamaica, six-time champions, were the most successful teams, winning a combined 14 titles of 18 editions. Martinique, Haiti, Cuba and Curaçao also won the tournament.

In 1990 on the day of the final, an insurrection in Trinidad and Tobago, the host nation, by the Jamaat al Muslimeen forced an abandonment of the tournament with only the final and 3rd place play-off game remaining. Also, the tournament was not held in 2000, 2002 and 2003.

The 2017 edition of the tournament was the 19th and final. The tournament was discontinued in favour of participation in the CONCACAF Nations League.

==Sponsors==
Over the years, the tournament has been named after its respective sponsors. Shell had sponsored the competition since its inception in 1989.

By February 1996, Jack Warner had announced a new sponsorship from sports apparel company Umbro for the 1996 Caribbean Cup. The tournament was also co-sponsored by Umbro in 1997 before Shell re-attained sole-sponsorship for the 1998 event.

In October 1998, during the first and only year of sponsorship from the Asia Sport Group (now World Sport Group), the competition changed its name to Copa Caribe. CFU&#x27;s chairman Jack Warner stated that the change was made to highlight the competition being a branch of the Copa de Oro. Florida-based Inter/Forever (now Traffic Group) agreed a sponsorship deal to replace the Asia Sport Group agreement in January 1999. The competition retained the title Copa Caribe for the 1999 and 2001 editions.

There was no competition held in 2003, instead teams focused on a group-stage only qualifying tournament.

Caribbean-based mobile phone company Digicel took over the sponsorship in 2004, in June 2007 they agreed to sponsor the 2008 and 2010 events. The 2012 and 2014 editions of the competition had no title sponsor, while the last tournament (in 2017) was sponsored by Scotiabank.

==Results==
19 editions of the tournament were held.

<doc id="1125579" wikidata="Q14591061" url="?curid=1125579" title="Roy M. Huffington">
<text>Roy Michael Huffington (October 4, 1917 – July 11, 2008) was an American oilman originally from Tomball in Harris County, Texas, who later served as United States Ambassador to Austria.

==Early career==
Huffington was born in Tomball, Texas. He graduated from Southern Methodist University where he was a brother of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He earned both Master of Arts and PhD degrees in geology from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After serving as, first ensign and then lieutenant commander in the United States Navy from 1942–1945, he returned to Texas in 1946 and worked as a field geologist for Humble Oil, now known as Exxon, U.S.A.

==HUFFCO==
In 1956, he set up his own oil and natural gas exploration company known as Roy M. Huffington, Inc. (Huffco). Huffco grew to be a major independent international oil company active around the world. In 1966 HUFFCO signed production sharing contract with Pertamina to explore oil in the Kutai Basin of the Mahakam River delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Initially the exploration object was oil, but finally Huffco discovered a giant natural gas reserve in 1972 at Badak Field. Then Huffco and Pertamina initiated to build an LNG plant in Bontang. First shipping was in August 1977, only five years after discovery.

==Later career==
In 1990, all properties of the company were sold to the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan and HUFFCO became VICO. 

From 1990 to 1993, Huffington served as Ambassador to Austria in the administration of U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush. He then returned to Houston and resumed the position of chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Roy M. Huffington, Inc., an independent international oil company.

==Philanthropy==
Roy Huffington joined the Board of the Salzburg Global Seminar, an international policy center based in Salzburg, Austria, with offices in Washington, D.C., while serving as U.S. Ambassador to Austria. In 1994, he was elected chairman of the Salzburg Global Seminar Board, a position which he held until 2007. Huffington also served as the chairman of the Asia Society, a New York-based charity, for seven years in the 1980s.

He also founded the Huffington Foundation, a Houston-based charity.

He and his wife, the former Phyllis Gough, who died in 2003, created the Huffington Center on Aging at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Huffington, having been a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at SMU, donated a significant (undisclosed) amount of money to the Alpha Tau Omega Educational Foundation, which provides collegiate scholarships for undergraduate members of the fraternity.

==Personal life==
Roy and Phyllis Huffington had two children: Terry Dittman, whose family lives in Houston, and Michael Huffington (born 1947), who was a Republican U.S. representative from California from 1993-1995. In 1994, Michael Huffington narrowly lost the election for the United States Senate to Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Michael Huffington was married to Arianna Huffington from 1986-1997. Arianna Huffington, an unsuccessful candidate for governor of California in the 2003 recall election, is the founder of the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;.

Roy Huffington died of natural causes in Venice, Italy.

<text>Kelso is a ghost town and defunct railroad depot in the Mojave National Preserve in San Bernardino County, California, USA. It was named after railroad worker John H. Kelso, whose name was placed into a hat along with two other workers to decide the name of the town. The town was built in 1905 specifically as a railroad station along the rail line between Utah and Los Angeles, originally called &quot;Siding 16,&quot; because of its location and nearby springs that provided abundant water. &quot;Historic Spots in California&quot; states, &quot;At Kelso stands a beautiful Spanish-style Union Pacific Depot built about 1906, surrounded by shade trees, a welcome rarity in the hot, barren desert.&quot;

== History ==
Starting off as what was a simple train depot in the 1920s, the town of Kelso boomed briefly to as many as 2,000 residents in the 1940s, when borax and iron mines opened nearby. Gold and silver were also discovered in the nearby hills of what became known as the Kelso district. The town shrank again when the mines closed after about a decade.

Kelso was a base of operations for the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, connecting track of Union Pacific Railroad, to which the SPLA&amp;SL had negotiated trackage rights, with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway east-west line to the south. Here, trains were watered and &quot;helper&quot; locomotives were attached to assist the regular trains in climbing the steep Cima Hill. The distance between Las Vegas and the connection with the Santa Fe line at Daggett was too far for trains without a meal car, so Kelso was a convenient spot for a restaurant stop.

The depot building itself was built in 1923 using a Spanish &quot;California mission&quot; building style. It contained boarding rooms for railroad employees and a restaurant for both employees and passengers. It also had a telegraph office and waiting room. Later, a restaurant nicknamed the &quot;Beanery&quot; that served home-style meals was housed in the building. The large rooms in the basement also served as a community center for local residents.

About 1944 the railroad brought in an old strap-iron jail to detain local drunks. It is now on display just outside the Kelso Depot.

The depot remained in operation until 1986. Left to the harsh conditions in the desert, the building began to deteriorate. By the mid-1990s the railroad was on the verge of demolishing the depot. Preservationists then stepped in to save it. In 2005, it was renovated to become the Mojave National Preserve&#x27;s visitor center. The facility is currently closed for repairs.

During the 1970s Kelso was known as &quot;the town without television.&quot; About 75 residents lived in Kelso, many with school age children. Television signals could not reach the town which meant that residents found other methods of recreation. However, with the advent of satellite dishes, television was eventually introduced to Kelso.

The ZIP Code is 92309 and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760.

The Kelso Mountains are located north of Kelso, the Kelso Dunes lie to the southwest, and the entire area lies within the boundary of the Mojave National Preserve.

<doc id="1125624" wikidata="Q5024384" url="?curid=1125624" title="Calvin Fairbank">
<text>Calvin Fairbank (November 3, 1816 – October 12, 1898) was an American abolitionist and Methodist minister from New York state who was twice convicted in Kentucky of aiding the escape of slaves, and served a total of 19 years in the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Frankfort. Fairbank is believed to have aided the escape of 47 slaves.

Pardoned in 1849 after four years of his first sentence, Fairbank returned to his Underground Railroad work. He was arrested in 1851 with the aid of the governor of Indiana, who was enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Fairbank was convicted again in Kentucky and served the full sentence of 15 years.

==Early life==
Calvin Fairbank was born in 1816 in Pike, in what is now Wyoming County, New York, to Chester Fairbank and his wife; he grew up in an intensely religious family environment. It was also the period of the Second Great Awakening, and western New York was a center of evangelical activity. Listening to the stories told by two escaped slaves whom he met at a Methodist quarterly meeting, the young Fairbank became strongly anti-slavery.

He began his career freeing slaves in 1837 when, piloting a lumber raft down the Ohio River, he ferried a slave across the river to free territory. Soon he was delivering escaped slaves to the Quaker abolitionist Levi Coffin for transportation on the Underground Railroad to northern US cities or to Canada.

==Aliases==
Calvin Fairbank used aliases: Samuel P. King, Samuel S. King, John Doe, Richard Roe/Rowe and John Rowe.

==Methodist Episcopal Church==
The Methodist Episcopal Church licensed Fairbank to preach in 1840 and ordained him as a minister in 1842. Hoping to improve his education, he enrolled in 1844 in the &quot;preparatory division&quot; of Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Ohio, now Oberlin College. It was interracial and a center of anti-slavery sentiment. At Oberlin, Fairbank met future AME bishop, John M. Brown and the pair worked together in underground railroad activities.

==Abolitionist==

===Gilson Berry===
Responding to an appeal to rescue the wife and children of an escaped slave named Gilson Berry, Fairbank went to Lexington, Kentucky, where he made contact with Delia Webster, a teacher from Vermont who was working there and had become active as an abolitionist. She was to help with the rescue, but Berry&#x27;s wife failed to meet Fairbank as planned.

By chance, he met Lewis Hayden and his family, who were planning an escape. He asked Hayden, &quot;Why do you want your freedom?&quot; Hayden responded, &quot;Because I am a man.&quot;
===The Haydens===
Fairbank and Webster transported Hayden, his wife Harriet and Harriet&#x27;s son Joseph by carriage to freedom in Ripley, Ohio. (See John Rankin (abolitionist).) The fugitive couple put flour on their faces to appear white and, in times of danger, would hide their son under the wagon seat. As Fairbank and Webster returned to Kentucky, they were identified and arrested for assisting the runaway slaves.

Webster was tried in December 1844 and sentenced to two years in the Kentucky state penitentiary, but she was pardoned by the governor after serving less than two months of her sentence. Fairbank was tried in 1845 and sentenced to a 15-year term, five years for each of the slaves he helped free.

He was pardoned in 1849 in an effort begun by his father. Effectively Lewis Hayden ransomed Fairbank, as he raised the $650 demanded by his former master to approve the pardon. Hayden had quickly collected the money within a few weeks from 160 people in Boston, where he and his family had settled.

===Tamar===
In 1851, Fairbank helped a slave named Tamar escape from Kentucky to Indiana. On November 9 of that year, with the connivance of the sheriff of Clark County, Indiana and Indiana Governor Joseph A. Wright, marshals from Kentucky abducted Fairbank and took him back to their state for trial. In 1852, he was sentenced to 15 years in the state penitentiary. While imprisoned, he was singled out for exceptionally harsh treatment; he was frequently flogged and overworked.

===Imprisonment effects===
Over his combined imprisonment of more than 17 years, Fairbank was reported to have received 35,000 lashes in prison floggings. In an April 5, 1850 article, &quot;The Liberator&quot; summarized a letter from Fairbank to William Lloyd Garrison: &quot;He expresses gratitude to the people of Boston, indicates an intention to write a book about his experiences, and indicates that letters to him can be sent in care of Lewis Hayden.&quot;

Finally, in 1864, three years into the American Civil War, Fairbank was pardoned by Acting Governor Richard T. Jacob, who had long advocated the activist&#x27;s release. When Thomas Bramlette returned to office, he had Jacob arrested and expelled from the state for his attacks on Lincoln during the presidential campaign and support for George B. McClellan.

==Marriage and family==

Once free, Fairbank married Mandana Tileston, to whom he had been engaged for thirteen years, since his brief period of freedom in 1851. Known as &quot;Dana,&quot; she moved from Williamsburg, Massachusetts, to Oxford, Ohio, in order to visit Fairbank in prison as often as possible and to press the case for his pardon with the Governor of Kentucky. Their only child, Calvin Cornelius Fairbank, was born in 1868.

The conditions of Fairbank&#x27;s life in prison broke his health. Although he held jobs with missionary and benevolent societies, he was not able to support his family. At one point, he and his wife tried to earn a living operating a bakery in the utopian community of Florence, Massachusetts. After Mandana Fairbank died of tuberculosis in 1876, Calvin gave their son to the care of her sister and brother-in-law. Fairbank remarried in 1879, but little is known of his second wife, Adeline Winegar, except that she was the daughter of Henry and Jane Winegar and like Calvin, a native of Pike. In the 1870 census she had been listed as a domestic servant. She died of cancer on February 12, 1901, in Angelica, and was buried next to Calvin in the local cemetery.

==Memoirs==
Fairbank wrote his memoir, publishing it in 1890 under the title, &quot;Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times: How He &quot;Fought the Good Fight&quot; to Prepare &quot;the Way.&quot;&quot; This effort earned him little money. He died in near-poverty in Angelica, New York. He was buried there in the Until the Day Dawn Cemetery. He is credited with helping free 47 slaves.

==Legacy==
In the 21st century, James Pritchard, a retired state archivist for Kentucky who published articles about the Underground Railroad, and several other persons worked to petition Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear to pardon Fairbank and others convicted of helping slaves escape. From 1844 to 1870, Kentucky imprisoned 44 persons for activities to free slaves in the state, not releasing the last man until five years after the end of the American Civil War. Eight of these persons died in prison.

On October 22, 2022, Rev. Calvin Fairbank was inducted into the National Abolitionist Hall of Fame and Museum in Peterboro, New York.

<doc id="1125625" wikidata="Q1758393" url="?curid=1125625" title="Inborn errors of metabolism">
<text>Inborn errors of metabolism form a large class of genetic diseases involving congenital disorders of enzyme activities. The majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances (substrates) into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or due to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic disorders. Another term used to describe these disorders is &quot;enzymopathies&quot;. This term was created following the study of biodynamic enzymology, a science based on the study of the enzymes and their products. Finally, &quot;inborn errors of metabolism&quot; were studied for the first time by British physician Archibald Garrod (1857–1936), in 1908. He is known for work that prefigured the &quot;one gene–one enzyme&quot; hypothesis, based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria. His seminal text, &quot;Inborn Errors of Metabolism&quot;, was published in 1923.

== Classification of metabolic diseases ==

Traditionally the inherited metabolic diseases were classified as disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, organic acid metabolism, or lysosomal storage diseases. In recent decades, hundreds of new inherited disorders of metabolism have been discovered and the categories have proliferated. Following are some of the major classes of congenital metabolic diseases, with prominent examples of each class. 
==Signs and symptoms==
Because of the enormous number of these diseases and the numerous systems negatively impacted, nearly every &quot;presenting complaint&quot; to a healthcare provider may have a congenital metabolic disease as a possible cause, especially in childhood and adolescence. The following are examples of potential manifestations affecting each of the major organ systems.
==Diagnostic==
Dozens of congenital metabolic diseases are now detectable by newborn screening tests, especially expanded testing using mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry-based technology with an integrated analytics system has now made it possible to test a newborn for over 100 mm genetic metabolic disorders. Because of the multiplicity of conditions, many different diagnostic tests are used for screening. An abnormal result is often followed by a subsequent &quot;definitive test&quot; to confirm the suspected diagnosis.

Common screening tests used in the last sixty years:
* Ferric chloride test (detects abnormal metabolites in urine)
* Ninhydrin paper chromatography (detects abnormal amino acid patterns)
* Guthrie test (detects excessive amounts of specific amino acids in blood) The dried blood spot can be used for multianalyte testing using Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). This given an indication for a disorder. The same has to be further confirmed by enzyme assays, IEX-Ninhydrin, GC/MS or DNA Testing.
* Quantitative measurement of amino acids in plasma and urine
* IEX-Ninhydrin post-column derivitization liquid ion chromatography (detects abnormal amino acid patterns and quantitative analysis)
* Urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
* Plasma acylcarnitine analysis by mass spectrometry
* Urine purine and pyrimidine analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

Specific diagnostic tests (or focused screening for a small set of disorders):
* Tissue biopsy: liver, muscle, brain, bone marrow
* Skin biopsy and fibroblast cultivation for specific enzyme testing
* Specific DNA testing

A 2015 review reported that even with all these diagnostic tests, there are cases when &quot;biochemical testing, gene sequencing, and enzymatic testing can neither confirm nor rule out an IEM, resulting in the need to rely on the patient&#x27;s clinical course&quot;. A 2021 review showed that several neurometabolic disorders converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered central in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment. This highlights the importance of close collaboration between health services to avoid clinical overshadowing.

==Treatment==
In the middle of the 20th century the principal treatment for some of the amino acid disorders was restriction of dietary protein and all other care was simply management of complications. In the past twenty years, new medications, enzyme replacement, gene therapy, and organ transplantation have become available and beneficial for many previously untreatable disorders. Some of the more common or promising therapies are listed:
==Epidemiology==
In a study in British Columbia, the overall incidence of the inborn errors of metabolism were estimated to be 40 per 100,000 live births or 1 in 2,500 births, overall representing more than approximately 15% of single gene disorders in the population. While a Mexican study established an overall incidence of 3.4:1,000 live newborns and a carrier detection of 6.8:1,000 NBS.

<text>The City of Oxford Motor Services Limited, trading as Oxford Bus Company, is a bus operator serving the city and surrounding area of Oxford, England. It is a subsidiary of the Go-Ahead Group.

==History==
===Horse trams and horse buses===
The City of Oxford and District Tramway Company served Oxford with horse-drawn trams from 1881. By 1898 its network served Abingdon Road, Banbury Road, Cowley Road, Walton Street and both and railway stations.

Horse bus services developed to complement the tramway network. By the early 20th century both Iffley Road and Woodstock Road were horse bus routes. On Saturdays only there were horse buses from Headington to the city centre and from Cowley village to the tram terminus in Cowley Road.

In 1906 the City of Oxford Electric Tramways Company took over from the City of Oxford and District Tramway Company. It planned to electrify and expand the network, but was defeated by local opposition.

===Motor buses===

In 1913–14, and under threat of competition from William Morris and Frank Gray, the tram company replaced its trams and horse buses with Daimler motor buses.

In 1921, the company was renamed City of Oxford Motor Services Limited (COMS). It continued to expand its operations into the surrounding countryside. From the 1930s, COMS was controlled by British Electric Traction, with the Great Western Railway having a minority shareholding. The fleet livery was red with maroon and pale green relief. Most of its buses were built on AEC chassis and running gear. Numerous former COMS buses have been preserved, including a large and notable collection at the Oxford Bus Museum in Long Hanborough in Oxfordshire.

In 1969 COMS became a subsidiary of the National Bus Company, commencing greater integration of city and country services. In 1971, the Oxford – London coach operator South Midland, which had been controlled by the neighbouring Thames Valley Traction company, was transferred to COMS and the fleet name for the entire operation became Oxford South Midland.

An acute problem for the operator was the competition for staff with Morris Motors, whose Cowley factory was near the Oxford garage. One response was to move to one person operation of buses in the 1970s.

In 1983, COMS was split into separate Oxford and South Midland units. Oxford Bus Company was allocated the Oxford city services and the London routes, and South Midland was allocated the remainder of the network. Both companies were subject to management buyouts. The South Midland company was soon resold to Thames Transit (later Stagecoach South Midlands), which introduced minibus competition. Oxford Bus Company tried to counter this with minibuses under the Oxford City Nipper brand name.
In 1990, Oxford Bus Company acquired the High Wycombe operations of the Bee Line, and ran them under the Wycombe Bus brand name. In March 1994, Oxford Bus Company was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group, with the company formally rebranded to &quot;The Oxford Bus Company&quot; and its city services being given &quot;Cityline&quot; branding a few months afterwards. In 2000, Go-Ahead sold the High Wycombe operation to Arriva. The company&#x27;s long-established main depot in Cowley Road, Oxford was closed in 2004, replaced by a new depot opened in Watlington Road.

Go-Ahead bought Thames Travel in June 2011 and Carousel Buses in February 2012. These companies act as subsidiaries of the Oxford Bus Company, sharing management but retaining their separate identities.

In October 2019, it was announced that the X90 service between Oxford and London would be withdrawn from 4 January 2020, due to a 35% fall in passenger numbers since 2015 causing the route to be unprofitable.

In June 2023, Go-Ahead announced it had acquired the Gloucestershire independent Pulhams Coaches. The Pulhams operation, consisting of 90 buses, operates 22 bus services and 126 employees, will remain a separate brand under the management of the Oxford Bus Company.

==Brands==

As of 2023, the Oxford Bus Company currently operates services under four route brands:
===City===
A majority of Oxford Bus Company buses are branded in colour-coded &#x27;City&#x27; branding for local bus services in and around the city of Oxford. This branding was first introduced in 2015 with the introduction of magenta Wright StreetDeck buses branded for the City5 before being progressively rolled out to ten other bus services. The scope of the &#x27;City&#x27; brand has further expanded with the addition of two express routes and the City46, the latter of which is partially funded by restauranteur Raymond Blanc.

===Park &amp; Ride===
Commencing operations on 10 December 1973 at the site of a former waste disposal site in Redbridge, the first permanent system of its type in the United Kingdom, Oxford&#x27;s Park &amp; Ride network serves Oxford city centre via two routes serving four peripheral park &amp; ride sites around Oxford. Service 300 runs from the northern Pear Tree park &amp; ride site to the southern Redbridge site, while service 400 runs from the western Seacourt site to the eastern Thornhill site. Most services are operated by Wright StreetDeck buses branded in black and purple liveries, 20 of which were originally purchased for use on the Park &amp; Ride in 2016, replacing older Alexander Dennis Enviro400H buses used on the service. 

Park &amp; Ride service 400 was merged with the BROOKESbus U1 service to operate between Harcourt Hill and Wheatley via Oxford Brookes University in September 2022. It is operated using Wright StreetDeck Electroliner battery electric buses delivered in November 2023, branded in grey livery.

===The Airline===
&#x27;The Airline&#x27; is an express coach service linking Oxford with London Heathrow Airport every twenty minutes and Gatwick Airport every hour, with both services operating every day of the year. The service is operated by eighteen Mercedes-Benz Tourismo coaches acquired in 2019 and 2023, two of which were wrapped in advertisements for The Ashmolean museum in Oxford city centre.

===BROOKESbus===
BROOKESbus is a network of services providing bus links between the campuses and student halls of the Oxford Brookes University, open to passengers regardless of whether they are students at the university. The service was initially launched in 2003 by Stagecoach in Oxfordshire with a fleet of eight buses, however the Oxford Bus Company would gain the contract to operate the service in 2009, with the BROOKESbus network being continuously operated by the company since.

==Fleet==
As of November 2023, Oxford Bus Company&#x27;s fleet consists of up to 160 buses, minibuses and coaches, a majority of which are operated on local bus services in and around Oxford. 

The company currently operates 104 battery electric buses produced by Wrightbus. 91 buses from this order are Wright StreetDeck Electroliner double deckers, eight of them being open-top examples for the company&#x27;s City Sightseeing operations, and the remaining five buses from this order being Wright GB Kite Electroliner single deck buses. The first 21 battery-electric StreetDecks from this order were delivered in November 2023 for service on the BROOKESbus park and ride service, with an event being held in January 2024 to celebrate the launch of Oxford&#x27;s electric bus fleet, in conjunction with an order by Stagecoach West for 55 Alexander Dennis Enviro400EVs for services in and around the city.

===Bus location technology===
All Oxford Bus Company buses and coaches have automatic vehicle location (AVL) equipment installed which works via GPS technology. The AVL equipment installed on each bus or coach gives geographical location to within a few metres and is updating central control room every few seconds. This information technology can therefore be seen in real time at the central control room, which helps in managing the fleet.

The AVL equipment is also coupled to a real-time passenger information system at over 250 bus stop display screens around Oxford City and surrounding towns, and via a smartphone app. This coupled information technology system gives the public &quot;predicted times&quot; of bus and coach services around Oxford City and surrounding towns.

Oxfordshire County Council also uses this information technology to provide traffic-light priority for buses at some road junctions.

The real-time passenger information system is managed by OxonTime, which is a partnership between various bus companies and Oxfordshire County Council.

===&#x27;Brand the Bus&#x27; initiative===

Since 2018, Oxford Bus Company has run an annual initiative named &#x27;Brand the Bus&#x27;, in which local charities and causes in Oxford submit designs for a charitable all-over advertisement to be applied to an Oxford Bus Company double-decker bus for a two-year period. The top ten designs are voted on by the general public before being submitted by an internal judging panel to select an overall winner. Two organisations that had advertised on Oxford Bus Company buses in 2018 prior to the initiative being launched were Oxford Pride and the Oxfordshire Prostate Cancer Support Group.

The past winners of the &#x27;Brand the Bus&#x27; initiative were:
* 2018-2019: GirlGuiding Oxfordshire
* 2019-2020: Home Start Oxford
* 2020-2021: Blue Skye Thinking
* 2021-2022: Restore
* 2022-2023: SeeSaw
* 2023-2024: Oxford Hospitals Charity

<doc id="1125638" wikidata="Q547500" url="?curid=1125638" title="The End of the Innocence (album)">
<text>The End of the Innocence is the third solo studio album by Don Henley, the co-lead vocalist and drummer for the Eagles. The album was released in 1989, on Geffen Records, and was his last release on that label. It was also his last solo album before reforming the Eagles and it would be eleven years before he released another solo project, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Inside Job&quot;.

The album is Henley&#x27;s best selling release, selling over 6 million copies in the United States alone, peaking at No. 8. The album featured three Top 40 singles &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, and &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot;. Those singles reached No. 8, No. 21, and No. 21 respectively. The album also featured &quot;New York Minute&quot; which reached No. 48 on the charts and was recorded by Henley and the Eagles for their live album &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; in 1994. Henley won another Grammy and an MTV Video Music Award nomination for the title track. In 2012, the album was ranked at number 389 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

== Background ==
The song &quot;I Will Not Go Quietly&quot; features harmony vocals by Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose, who at the time was also on the same label.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote of the album at the time, &quot;Returning to the theme of &#x27;Desperado,&#x27; the former Eagle hitched some of his finest melodies (especially on the gentle title track) to sharply focused lyrical studies of men in troubled transition – from youth to adulthood, innocence to responsibility.&quot;

Reviewing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Vik Iyengar has written of the album, &quot;Henley took some time before completing his highly anticipated third album, &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;. Although he manages to duplicate much of the magic of his previous album, Henley has backed off of the synthesizers and expanded his musical palette.&quot; They also add that &quot;Throughout the album, he manages to balance being cynical yet hopeful, and his great melodies allow his poignant lyrics to penetrate. This album is highly recommended for those who like their pop music with a message.&quot;

<doc id="1125644" wikidata="Q2590210" url="?curid=1125644" title="Tekhelet">
<text>Tekhelet ( &quot;təḵēleṯ&quot;; alternative spellings include &quot;tekheleth&quot;, &quot;t&#x27;chelet&quot;, &quot;techelet&quot;, and &quot;techeiles&quot;) is a highly valued dye described as either &quot;[[sky blue]]&quot; (), or &quot;light blue&quot; (, see Arabic kohl), that held great significance in ancient Mediterranean civilizations. In the Hebrew Bible and Jewish tradition, tekhelet was used to colour the clothing of the High Priest of Israel, the tapestries in the Tabernacle, and the &quot;tzitzit&quot; (fringes) attached to the corners of four-cornered garments, including the tallit.

The Bible does not specify the source or production method of tekhelet. According to later rabbinic literature, it was exclusively derived from a marine creature known as the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; (, from ). However, the knowledge of tekhelet production was lost during the Middle Ages, leading to the omission of tekhelet from tzitzit. In recent times, many Jews believe that experts have identified the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; and rediscovered the process for manufacturing tekhelet, leading to the revival of its use in tzitzit. The snail &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; (historically known as &quot;Murex trunculus&quot;) is widely considered to be the creature responsible for producing authentic tekhelet.

A garment with tzitzit consists of four tassels, each containing four strings. There are three differing opinions in rabbinic literature regarding the number of strings in each tassel that should be dyed with tekhelet: two strings, one string, or one-half string.

==Biblical references==
Of the 49 or 48 uses of the word &quot;tekhelet&quot; in the Masoretic Text, one refers to fringes on cornered garments of the whole people of Israel (). The remaining 6 in Esther, Jeremiah and Ezekiel are secular uses, such as when Mordechai puts on &quot;blue and white&quot; &quot;royal clothing&quot; in Esther. Tekhelet could be used in combination with other colours such as 2 Chronicles where the veil of Solomon&#x27;s Temple is made of tekhelet, Tyrian purple () and scarlet ( or ). states that &quot;tekhelet&quot;-cloth could be obtained from &quot;isles of Elishah&quot; (likely Cyprus). All Biblical mentions of tekhelet, both secular and priestly) attribute its usage to some kind of elite. This implies that it was difficult to obtain and expensive, an impression further corroborated by the later rabbinic writings.

==History==
The manufacture of tekhelet appears to date back to at least 1750 BCE in Crete. In the Amarna letters (14th century BCE) tekhelet garments are listed as a precious good used for a royal dowry.

At some point following the Roman destruction of the Second Temple during the Siege of Jerusalem in 70&quot; &quot;CE, the identity of the source of the dye was lost, and since then Jews have only worn &quot;tzitzit&quot; without tekhelet. The Talmud mentions use of &quot;tekhelet&quot; in the period of Rav Ahai (5th–6th century); however the Tanhuma (8th century) laments that &quot;tekhelet&quot; has been lost.

This loss appears to have been caused by a progression of historical events. Already in the first century, Julius Caesar and Augustus restricted the use of the &quot;Murex&quot; dye to the governing class. Nero made laws that stated no one was allowed to wear purple because it was the color of royalty, and specifically he forbade goods dyed with &quot;purpura&quot;, the name used for &quot;H. trunculus&quot; under penalty of death. The idea that it was illegal to wear &quot;tekhelet&quot; is corroborated by a Talmudic story, in which rabbis caught smuggling &quot;tekhelet&quot; were liable to the death penalty. In the sixth century, Justinian put the tekhelet and Tyrian purple industries under a royal monopoly, causing independent dyers to cease their work and find other employment. The apparent final straw was the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 639, in which the royal Byzantine dyeing industry was destroyed. Developments in the Jewish community may also have played a role, such as the proliferation of counterfeit (indigo) threads which made the procurement of genuine tekhelet difficult, and the persecution of Byzantine Jews, which interfered with their export of tekhelet to the communities in Lower Mesopotamia (Jewish &quot;Babylonia&quot;). Some have argued that the use of tekhelet persisted (at least in certain locations) for several centuries beyond the Muslim conquest, based on texts from the geonim and early rishonim which discuss the commandment in practical terms.

The reason why royalty used the &quot;Murex&quot; dye as opposed to indigo, which looked the same, was because indigo faded. However, once they figured out how to make indigo endure, they stopped using &quot;H. trunculus&quot; because indigo was much cheaper. That is when people stopped using it for its dye entirely.

==Identifying the colour of &quot;tekhelet&quot;==
Despite the general agreement of most of the modern English translations of the phrase, the term tekhelet itself presents several basic problems.

First, it remains unclear to what extent the word in biblical times denoted a colour or a source material, though it appears that at least in contemporary Mesopotamian sources, the cognate Assyrian and Babylonian word &quot;takiltu&quot; referred to a colour and not a material or dyeing process.

Second, although tekhelet came to denote the colour blue with time, the exact hue in antiquity is not definitively known. The task is made harder by the tendency of ancient writers to identify colours not so much by their hue as by other factors such as luminosity, saturation and texture. Modern scholars believe that &quot;tekhelet&quot; probably referred to blue-purple and blue colors. The colour of tekhelet was likely to have varied in practice, as ancient dyers were generally unable to reproduce exact shades from one batch of dye to another.

===Sources===

In the early classical sources (Septuagint, Aquila, Symmachus, Vulgate, Philo, and Josephus), &quot;tekhelet&quot; was translated into Koine Greek as &quot;hyakinthos&quot; (, &quot;hyacinth&quot;) or the Latin equivalent. The colour of the hyacinth flower ranges from violet blue to a bluish purple (though the hyacinth species dominant in the eastern Mediterranean, &quot;Hyacinthus orientalis&quot;, is violet), and the word &quot;hyakinthos&quot; was used to describe both blue and purple colours.

Early rabbinic sources provide indications as to the nature of the colour. Some sources describe &quot;tekhelet&quot; as visually indistinguishable from indigo ( ). This description is also somewhat ambiguous, as different varieties of indigo have colours ranging between blue and purple, but generally the colour of dyed indigo in the ancient world was blue.

Other rabbinic sources describe tekhelet as similar to the sea or sky. An oft-repeated explanation for the Torah&#x27;s choice of tekhelet went as follows: &quot;Why is tekhelet different from all other colours? Because tekhelet is similar [in appearance] to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to lapis lazuli, and lapis lazuli is similar to the Throne of Glory.&quot; (In a few versions of this source, &quot;plants&quot; are included in this chain of similarity even though plants are not blue; though it has been suggested that these sources refer to bluish plants like hyacinth.) Jose ben Jose was another early author who described &quot;tekhelet&quot; as resembling the sky.

In other sources, the colour of the tekhelet is compared to the night sky. Similarly, Rashi quotes Moshe ha-Darshan who describes it as &quot;the color of the sky as it darkens toward evening&quot; – a deep sky blue or dark violet.

Rashi himself describes the colour as &quot;green&quot; () and &quot;green, and close to the colour of leeks&quot;, the latter commenting on a Talmudic passage according to which the morning Shema may be recited once it is light enough to distinguish between tekhelet and leeks. Other Jewish texts comment that &quot;the appearance which is called in the language of Ashkenaz &quot;bleu&quot; () is within the category of green&quot; suggesting that Rashi&#x27;s language does not necessarily rule out a blue colour.

In Akkadian, the cognate word &quot;takiltu&quot; is written using the word sign, also used for lapis lazuli, suggesting they have similar colours. Lapis lazuli can vary between blue and purple-blue, and according to some sources the preferred shade of lapis lazuli in the Near East was purple-blue. However, Mesopotamian mythology asserted that visible sky is a layer of lapis lazuli stone underlying Heaven, suggesting a sky-blue color for the stone.

The Sifrei says that counterfeit tekhelet was made from both &quot;[red] dye and indigo&quot;, indicating that the overall color was purple. However, other sources list just &quot;indigo&quot; as the counterfeit, suggesting either that in their opinion the colour was purely blue, or that indigo was the main counterfeit ingredient and the other ingredients not significant enough to mention.

The Sippar Dye Text (7th century), as well as the Leyden papyrus X and Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis (3rd century) provide recipes for counterfeit &quot;takiltu&quot; that includes a mixture of red and blue colours, for an overall purple colour.

A pure blue can only be produced from Hexaplex dye through a debromination process. Only in the 1980s did modern scientists learn how to create blue Hexaplex dye using this process, leading some experts to declare that ancient dyers would not have been able to create blue tekhelet (and, therefore, that an undebrominated purple colour is more likely). However, in recent years archaeologists have recovered several fabrics dyed blue with Hexaplex dye 1800 or more years ago, demonstrating that ancient dyers could and did make blue dye from Hexaplex. Such fabrics have been found at Wadi Murabba&#x27;at (2nd century), Masada (1st century BCE), Qatna (14th century BCE), and arguably the Pazyryk burials (5th–4th century BCE).

==Identifying the &quot;ḥillazon&quot;==
While the Bible does not identify the source of tekhelet, rabbinic halakha specified that it could only be made from a sea creature known as the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;. Various animals have been suggested as the &quot;ḥillazon&quot;.

Rabbinic sources describe various qualities of this creature. It was found on the coast between Tyre and Haifa. &quot;Its body is similar to the sea, and its form (ברייתו) is similar to a fish, and it comes up [from the sea] once every 70 years, and with its blood &quot;tekhelet&quot; is dyed, therefore it is expensive.&quot; Dye was extracted from the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; by cracking it open, suggesting that it has a hard external shell. Just as the Hebrews&#x27; clothing did not wear out in the desert (), the shell of the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; does not wear out. Various animals have been suggested as the &quot;ḥillazon&quot;.

Garments dyed with tekhelet and indigo have such similar appearance that only God can distinguish them. Elsewhere, one opinion says that there is no chemical test which can distinguish between &quot;tekhelet&quot; and indigo wool, but another opinion describes such a test and tells the story of it working successfully. Trapping the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; is considered a violation of Shabbat. In the time of the Talmud, the &quot;hillāzon&quot; was used as part of a remedy for hemorrhoids, though this may refer to a different species of snail.

===&quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;===


In his doctoral thesis (London, 1913) on the subject, Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog named &quot;H. trunculus&quot; (then known by the name &quot;Murex trunculus&quot;) as the most likely candidate for the dye&#x27;s source. Herzog concluded &quot;it is very unlikely that the &quot;tekhelet&quot;-hillazon is not the snail called Murex trunculus, but though unlikely, it is still possible.&quot; Though &quot;H. trunculus&quot; fulfilled many of the Talmudic criteria, Herzog&#x27;s inability to consistently obtain blue dye (sometimes the dye was purple) from the snail precluded him from declaring it to be the dye source. In the 1980s, Otto Elsner, a chemist from the Shenkar College of Fibers in Israel, discovered that if a solution of the dye was exposed to ultraviolet rays such as from sunlight, blue instead of purple was consistently produced. In 1988, Rabbi Eliyahu Tavger dyed tekhelet from &quot;H. trunculus&quot; for the commandment of &quot;Tzitzit&quot; for the first time in recent history. Based on this work, four years later, the was founded to educate about the dye production process and to make the dye available for all who desire to use it. The television show &quot;The Naked Archaeologist&quot; interviews an Israeli scientist who also makes the claim that this mollusk is the correct animal. A demonstration of the production of the blue dye using sunlight to produce the blue colour is shown. The dye is extracted from the hypobranchial gland of &quot;H. trunculus&quot; snails.

Chemically, exposure to sunlight turns the red 6,6&#x27;-dibromoindigo in snails into a mixture of blue indigo dye and blue-purple 6-bromoindigo. The &quot;leuco&quot; (white) solution form of dibromoindigo loses some bromines in the ultraviolet radiation.

====Arguments for &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;====



The dye produced by Hexaplex has the exact same chemical composition as indigo, corresponding to the statement that only God can distinguish the &quot;tekhelet&quot; from indigo garments.

In the area between Tyre and Haifa where the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; was found, piles of murex shells hundreds of yards long have been found, apparently the result of dyeing operations. In Tel Shikmona (near Haifa), a &quot;biblical era purple dye workshop&quot; was found, including relics of purple dye produced from sea snails, as well as textile manufacturing equipment.

Chemical testing of ancient blue-dyed cloth from the appropriate time period in Israel reveals that a sea snail-based dye was used. Since murex dye was available, very long-lasting, and visibly indistinguishable from indigo-based dyes, but also not specifically prohibited as counterfeit despite being known, it is argued that &quot;H. trunculus&quot; (or one of the other two indigo-producing sea snails) must have been the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; or at least deemed as acceptable to use interchangeably.

Hexaplex has a hard external shell, as the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; appears to.

The word &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; is cognate to the Arabic word (), meaning snail. &quot;Hexaplex&quot; opponents suggest that in ancient times the word might have referred to a broader category of animals, perhaps including other candidate species such as the cuttlefish.

Another Talmudic requirement is that the dye cannot fade, and the &quot;H. trunculus&quot; dye does not fade and can only be removed from wool with bleach.

The Talmud states that the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; is preferably kept alive while the dye is extracted, as killing it causes the dye to degrade. This matches both ancient descriptions of the &quot;Hexaplex&quot; dyeing process and also modern experience that an enzyme in the snail needed for dye production decays quickly after death.

The Jerusalem Talmud as quoted by Raavyah translates tekhelet as &quot;porporin&quot;; similarly &quot;Musaf Aruch&quot; translates &quot;tekhelet&quot; as &quot;parpar&quot;. These translations refer to the Latin term &quot;purpura&quot;, meaning the dye produced by Hexaplex snails. Similarly, Yair Bacharach stated that tekhelet was derived from &quot;purpura&quot; snails, even though this forced him to conclude that the colour of &quot;tekhelet&quot; was purple (purpur) rather than blue, as in his era it was unknown how to produce blue dye from Hexaplex.

The word porforin, or porpora, or porphoros is used in the midrash as well as many other Jewish texts to refer to the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot;, and this is the Greek translation of &quot;Murex trunculus&quot;. Pliny and Aristotle also both refer to the Porpura as being the source for purple and blue dyes, showing that the Murex has a long history of being used for blue dye.

 speaks of treasures hidden in the sand; the Talmud states that the word &quot;treasures&quot; refers to the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;. Similarly, &quot;H. trunculus&quot; often burrows into the sand, making it difficult to detect even by scuba divers.

While (as described in the next section) Hexaplex arguably does not fit every textual description of the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;, nevertheless, &quot;Of the thousands of fish and mollusks that were studied to date, no other fish has been found that can produce the &quot;tekhelet&quot; color&quot;, which suggests that there is no more likely alternative species.

====Arguments against &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;====



The Talmud equates the colours of tekhelet and indigo but also gives a practical test to distinguish between the two fabrics. Seemingly, since the colour-producing compounds in &quot;H. trunculus&quot; and indigo are identical, no test should be able to distinguish them. However, according to Professor Otto Elsner, while Hexaplex and indigo have the same color-producing compound, they also contain other compounds which differ and may lead to a different response in the practical test. According to Dr. Israel Irving Ziderman&#x27;s writings in the 1980s, the test consists of a chemical reduction reaction occurring when hydrogen is produced by decaying organic matter. Indigo (from a vegetable source) is more strongly reduced than the debrominated indigo found in snail &quot;tekhelet&quot; (assuming a blue-purple rather than pure blue tekhelet), leading to a different result to the test. In 2003, Ziderman officially modified his stance, now maintaining that heating the violet wool in 60-80C will turn the wool to blue with a small hint of violet. This is opposed to the wool being blue with a hint of turquoise.

The &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;″s body resembles the sea. This does not appear to be true of &quot;Hexaplex&quot;. &quot;Hexaplex&quot; supporters argue that when alive, Hexaplex is well camouflaged and has a similar appearance to the sea floor, apparently due to algae growing on its shell. The shell colour can even be blue, similar to the sea.

The &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; has a &quot;form like a fish&quot;, which a snail seemingly does not. &quot;Hexaplex&quot; supporters reply that its shell somewhat resembles a fish in shape. Similarly Maimonides, Tosafot, and Rashi say the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; is a &quot;fish&quot; (דג), while &quot;Hexaplex&quot; is a snail rather than a fish. Hexaplex supporters argue that many forms of aquatic life (e.g., shellfish — of which sea snails would be an example) are also called &quot;דגים&quot; in Hebrew.

The &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; is said to come up from the sea once every 70 years. It is unclear what this is exactly referring to, but the Hexaplex has no such cycle. Hexaplex supporters note that elsewhere the Talmud makes clear that the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; was also hunted by normal methods at other times. Some sources say the reference to &quot;70 years&quot; does not imply a periodic cycle, but rather simply that this phenomenon is a rare event. Hexaplex may have cycles of other lengths which inspired this statement: a seven-month cycle for harvesting Hexaplex was claimed by Pliny and confirmed by modern researchers, while Hexaplex appears to have a yearly behavioural cycle in which it burrows in the sand in summer and emerges from swimming in winter. Other sources claim that the 70-year cycle was a miraculous occurrence which no longer occurs or else that the decrease in Hexaplex population numbers may have caused this behaviour to cease.

There are two other snails that produce the same dye as &quot;H. trunculus&quot;: &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot; and &quot;Stramonita haemastoma&quot;, so how do we know which one is the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;? Some argue that dye from any of these species would be valid. Alternatively, &quot;H. trunculus&quot; contains more natural indigo and thus is a more natural source for blue tekhelet and archaeological finds show &quot;H. trunculus&quot; being processed separately from snails of the other species, suggesting that a different color was derived from this species.

Trapping the &quot;Ḥillazon&quot; is a violation of Shabbat. However, according to some rishonim, in general, it is permitted to capture slow-moving animals like snails on Shabbat (as capturing them requires only a trivial effort - בחד שחיא). This contradiction suggests that the &quot;hillazon&quot; is not a snail. Hexaplex supporters argue that since Hexaplex tends to camouflage itself and hide in the sand, capturing it is a difficult process and thus (by some opinions) forbidden. There is another point of contention in that the animals permitted to catch are land-based slow-moving creatures. All sea-based creatures, aside from having the Halachic status of a &quot;fish&quot;, on a more practical level are impossible for the average person to gather without some form of trapping, and in fact, even today are caught with nets or wicker baskets.

Maimonides described the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;, stating that &quot;its blood is as black as ink&quot;, which does not seem to match the characteristics of Hexaplex. Hexaplex supporters argue that this claim has no source earlier than Rambam and seems to be based on a mistaken statement by Aristotle However, a black precipitate can indeed be derived from Hexaplex and refined into dye. Additionally, Aristotle classified the dye secretions of marine snails into two colour categories: black and red, with Tekhelet falling under the black blood category. In his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, Aristotle writes: &quot;There are many kinds of purpurae ... Most of them contain a black pigment; in others, it is red, and the quantity of it small.&quot;

Tractate Menachot and the Rambam explain the process for making the dye for tekhelet, and neither of them mention explicitly that it needs to be placed in the sunlight. Exposing the dye to sunlight is the most commonly used method today to make the dye from &quot;H. trunculus&quot;. Other methods have been discovered to produce blue, such as like boil heating or adding a strong reactant.

In 1887, Grand Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner, the Radziner Rebbe, researched the subject and concluded that &quot;Sepia officinalis&quot; (common cuttlefish) met many of the criteria. Within a year, Radziner chassidim began wearing tzitzit with cuttlefish dye. Herzog obtained a sample of this dye and had it chemically analyzed. The chemists concluded that it was a well-known synthetic dye &quot;Prussian blue&quot; made by reacting iron(II) sulfate with an organic material. In this case, the cuttlefish only supplied the organic material, which could have as easily been supplied from a vast array of organic sources (e.g., ox blood). Herzog thus rejected the cuttlefish as the &quot;ḥillāzon,&quot; and some suggest that had Leiner known this fact, he too would have rejected it based on his explicit criterion that the blue colour must come from the animal and that all other additives are permitted solely to aid the colour in adhering to the wool.

===&quot;Janthina&quot;===
Within his doctoral research on the subject of tekhelet, Herzog placed great hopes on demonstrating that &quot;H. trunculus&quot; was the genuine &quot;ḥillāzon.&quot; However, having failed to consistently achieve blue dye from Hexaplex, he wrote: &quot;If for the present all hope is to be abandoned of rediscovering the &quot;ḥillāzon shel tekhēleth&quot; in some species of the genera &quot;Murex&quot; [now &quot;Hexaplex&quot;] and &quot;Purpura&quot; we could do worse than suggest &quot;Janthina&quot; as a not improbable identification&quot;. Janthina is a genus of sea snails, separate from Hexaplex. More recently, blue dye has been obtained from &quot;Hexaplex&quot;, and the pigment molecule itself is hypothesized to be Tyrian purple or aplysioviolin. &quot;Janthina&quot; seems an unsuitable candidate in several ways: it was apparently only rarely used by ancient dyers; it is found far out at sea (while the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot; is apparently found near the coast); and its pigment is allegedly unsuitable for dyeing.

In 2002 Dr. S. W. Kaplan of Rehovot, Israel, sought to investigate Herzog&#x27;s suggestion that tekhelet came from the extract of &quot;Janthina&quot;. After fifteen years of research, he still believes that &quot;Janthina&quot; is the ancient source of the blue dye.

==Current status of the &quot;tekhelet&quot; commandment==
A midrash states that tekhelet was &quot;hidden&quot; () and now only white strings are available. According to the Sifrei, &quot;tekhelet&quot; is hidden until the next world. The meaning of the term &quot;hidden&quot; is unclear. Beit Halevi argued (when debating the Radziner rebbe) that a continuous tradition regarding the source of the dye, which no longer exists, was necessary in order for it to be used. However, Radbaz and Maharil ruled otherwise, that rediscovering the dye is sufficient to perform the commandment. Yeshuot Malko suggested that even if &quot;tekhelet&quot; was hidden until the messianic era, the apparent rediscovery of &quot;tekhelet&quot; suggests that the messianic era is approaching, rather than suggesting that the &quot;tekhelet&quot; is invalid.

According to halakha, when in doubt about the laws of a commandment from the Torah, one must act stringently. Some rabbis , therefore, argue that even if we are uncertain in our identification of the &quot;ḥillāzon&quot;, we must wear the most likely dye anyway (i.e. &quot;Hexaplex&quot;). Others disagree, asserting that the principle of stringency only applies in cases such that after one acts stringently, there is no further obligation (whereas if Hexaplex is only doubtfully correct, there would remain a theoretical obligation to find the actual correct species and use it). Nevertheless, a number of Rabbis have come out to wear Tekhelet publicly.

Based on , the Talmud rules that we should not make divisions among the Jewish people. Therefore, if a person acts differently from the rest of the Jewish people, they are creating divisions. Some have argued that one should not publicly wear tekhelet for this reason; others consider this not to be a concern. In any case it would not be relevant in many contemporary communities where &quot;tekhelet&quot;-wearing is widespread.

There exists a Torah commandment not to detract from any other law. Hershel Schachter says that if one knows what tekhelet is, yet chooses to wear tzizit without tekhelet, they are violating this commandment. Many other rabbis do not agree with this statement.

==Tying methods==
Maimonides holds that half of one string should be coloured blue, and it should wrap around the other seven white strings. It should wrap around three times and then leave some space and then three more and leave some more space and should continue like this for either 7 or 13 groups. The first and last wrap-around should be from a white string, not a blue string.

Abraham ben David holds that one full string should be blue, and there should be four groups of at least seven coils alternating between white and blue, both beginning and ending with blue. There are multiple other opinions of how to tie the tzitzit if one full string is blue.

Tosafot holds that two full strings should be tekhelet. He is of the opinion that the coils should be in groups of three, starting with three white, then three blue alternating and ending with three white. There is another way to tie using two full strings that Schachter follows based on the opinion of Samuel ben Hofni.

==Tekhelet in Jewish culture==
Besides the ritual uses of tekhelet, the colour blue plays various roles in Jewish culture, some of which are influenced by the role of tekhelet.

The stripes on the tallit, often black or blue, are believed by some to symbolize the lost &quot;tekhelet&quot;, though other explanations have been given. The use of blue in the tallit and temple robes led to the association of blue and white with Judaism and inspired the design of the flag of Israel.

Like their non-Jewish neighbors, Jews of the Middle East painted their doorposts, and other parts of their homes with blue dyes; have ornamented their children with tekhelet ribbons and markings; and have used this color in protective amulets. Tekhelet has been considered especially effective against the evil eye.

<text>Deccan Herald is an Indian English-language daily newspaper published from the Indian state of Karnataka. It was founded by businessman K. N. Guruswamy and launched on 17 June 1948. It is published by The Printers Mysore, a privately held company owned by the Nettakallappa family, heirs of Guruswamy. It has seven editions printed from Bengaluru, Hubballi, Davanagere, Hosapete, Mysuru, Mangaluru, and Kalaburagi.

==History and background==
&quot;Deccan Herald&quot; was launched on 17 June 1948. Its founder, K. N. Guruswamy, in search of a suitable location for a news publishing business, purchased a bar and restaurant called Funnel&#x27;s, that was owned by an Irish couple, in March 1948. Despite having no experience in the newspaper industry, Guruswamy, along with his close aides and well wishers, decided to launch two newspapers from Bangalore since there was no such title at the time. Veteran journalist Pothan Joseph served as its founding editor, which gave it a strong footing as an English paper.

K. N. Guruswamy (1901–1990) was the eldest son of a prominent businessman of Ballari (Bellary), who later shifted to Bangalore, and the family belonged to the Ediga community, which was traditionally involved in toddy tapping. They won excise contracts and expanded their business across (then known as Mysore, now Karnataka). Bangalore was then under the Kingdom of Mysore, ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, and lacked an English newspaper in those times. The then Diwan of Mysore, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, is believed to have been instrumental in convincing Guruswamy to start an English-language daily and he launched the firm The Printers (Mysore) Pvt Ltd. Justice P P Medappa, later the state&#x27;s chief justice, suggested the name &quot;Deccan Herald&quot;.

Of the 5,00,000 capital, some 75 percent came from Guruswamy. Other shareholders were K. Venkataswamy, Moola Rangappa, M. K. Swamy and Dondusa, according to Machaiah. He documents the challenges of getting it started. &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; was initially launched as an eight-page tabloid paper, priced at one &quot;anna&quot;. It became a broadsheet newspaper later.

&quot;Deccan Herald&quot; launched a sister daily in Kannada, called &quot;Prajavani&quot; in October 1948. T. S. Ramachandra Rao was its first editor. It has played a prominent role in the world of Kannada journalism and popular culture. Subsequent publications launched by the group include lifestyle magazine &quot;Sudha&quot; (initiated in 1965 and edited by E.R. Sethuram) and the literary magazine &quot;Mayura&quot;, launched in 1968.

Only in 1956, eight years after launch, was the company able to break even. Earlier, Guruswamy had to depend on bank loans and selling all but three of the 35 buildings he had purchased from proceeds of his excise business. Guruswamy moved out of the liquor business by 1986.

Guruswamy&#x27;s adopted son K. A. Nettakallappa, who became a well-known journalist, was instrumental in helping the business grow during the 1950s and 1960s. But he died young at the age of 47. Nettakallappa and &quot;Prajavani&quot; editor Ramachandra Rao are credited with playing a pioneering role in founding the Press Club of Bangalore.

== Recent profile ==
The company has been helmed by Nettakallappa&#x27;s sons—K. N. Hari Kumar, K. N. Tilak Kumar, and K. N. Shanth Kumar—since the early 1980s and the business continues to be privately owned and managed by the family. The publications adopt a policy of &quot;objectivity, integrity, impartiality and truth flying high&quot;. Deccan Herald&#x27;s tagline (2019) is &quot;The Power of Good.&quot;

Sitaraman Shankar was appointed editor of the Deccan Herald in September 2018, and was later appointed chief executive officer of the company.

In August 2019, the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; relaunched its newspaper with a &quot;revamped look to attract younger readers.&quot; Edinburgh-based Palmer Watson Words and Pictures design agency Deccan Herald has revamped its look. The English daily has got a new masthead in aqua blue, a colour to attract younger audience who need coaxing to pick up a newspaper. It added a new business section on Mondays, a Sunday opinion page called &quot;The Prism&quot;, and an entertainment section &quot;Showtime&quot; on Saturdays focussing on showbiz and streaming platforms, besides creating a &quot;Travel &amp; Living&quot; supplement on Tuesdays.

== Achievements and setbacks ==
Quoting the Indian Readership Survey (IRS) for the year 2013, the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; announced that it had &quot;emerged as one of the top ten English dailies in the country&quot;. IRS 2013 termed the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; as the eighth largest English-language daily in India, average issue readership-wise. The newspaper&#x27;s average issue readership stands at 4,58,000, including 3,38,000 in Bangalore city.

Deccan Herald has also faced its own share of setbacks. Plans for both an evening English-language daily and a New Delhi edition did not succeed. Since the late 1990s, it has faced competition from other English-language newspapers entering the city.

It was one of the early publications to hire women journalists in reporting roles in Indian journalism.

== Print and digital operations ==
&quot;Deccan Herald&quot;&#x27;s Bengaluru edition is printed at a modern facility located in the Kumbalgodu Industrial Area since 1998. It has been printing in colour in its main edition since 1985.

The &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; was one of the early Indian newspapers to launch its own website, on 15 April 1996, and claims &quot;14 million page views per month&quot; as of 2018.

== Controversies ==
A controversial short story was published in the Sunday magazine supplement of the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; newspaper in December 1986. The story was about a young boy named Mohammad who died by suicide due to the travails of his family suffering from poverty. It was a fictional story originally written by PKN Namboodri a decade earlier in Malayalam language and had nothing to do with the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It created no turmoil when first published in the Kannada language. However, Muslims in the city of Bengaluru took that story as a reference to their prophet and protested violently. Marchers went on a rampage and attacked police personnel in the city of Bengaluru, Mysore, and Mandya. Curfew was declared in Bengaluru and its suburban areas. The newspaper&#x27;s editor, who happened to be its publisher, was arrested for &quot;fomenting enmity between two communities and writing articles in a manner prejudicial to public peace.&quot; However, he was soon released on bail. At least 16 people died, primarily to police gunfire, and over 175 arrests were made.

<text>Flying Officer Phillip Edward Gerald Sayer (5 February 1905 – 21 October 1942), was the chief test pilot for Gloster Aircraft as well as a serving RAF officer. &quot;Gerry&quot; Sayer flew Britain&#x27;s maiden jet flight in Sir Frank Whittle&#x27;s Gloster E.28/39 (Pioneer), an aircraft designed by George Carter, on 15 May 1941.

==Early life==
He was born in Colchester, the only son of Wing Commander E. J. Sayer . He attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Nainital in India and Colchester Royal Grammar School in England.

==Career==

===Royal Air Force===
Sayer joined the Royal Air Force on 30 June 1924, being granted a short service commission with the rank of probationary pilot officer, and was posted to No. 29 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Duxford. He was confirmed in his rank on 23 May 1925, and was promoted to flying officer on 30 March 1926. He learnt to fly in an Avro 504K, and later flew Sopwith Snipes, before becoming a test pilot at RAF Martlesham Heath, the home of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment.

===Test pilot===
Sayer was transferred to the Reserve of Air Force Officers (Class A) on 2 March 1929, to become second test pilot with Hawker Aircraft, assistant to Group Captain P. W. S. (George) Bulman (who first flew the Hurricane on 6 November 1935). He also competed in the 1930 King&#x27;s Cup Air Race, flying the Cirrus Hermes-powered Desoutter Mk.I &quot;(G-AAPY)&quot; entered by Charles Bernard Wilson. He averaged over the course and came in 23rd place.

In 1934 Hawker took over the Gloster Aircraft Company and Sayer was appointed chief test pilot in November 1934. On 2 March 1937 Sayer relinquished his reserve commission on completion of service, and was permitted to retain his rank.

On 15 May 1941 at 7.45pm, he took off from RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire in the Gloster E.28/39 (W4041/G) powered by the W.1 engine and flew for 17 minutes, flying at over , impossible for other aircraft at the time in level flight. That Gloster aircraft has been in the Science Museum since 1946. A second aircraft of the same type (W4046/G) would be later demonstrated to Winston Churchill on 17 April 1943, having first flown on 1 March 1943 and later crashed in June 1943.

On 21 October 1942 Sayer departed from RAF Acklington in a Hawker Typhoon to carry out tests of a gunsight involving gun firing into Druridge Bay Ranges, accompanied by another Typhoon. Neither aircraft returned, and it was assumed that they collided over the bay. He was replaced as Gloster&#x27;s test pilot by Michael Daunt, who would be the first to fly the Gloster Meteor (powered by two de Havilland Goblin engines designed by Frank Halford) on 5 March 1943 at RAF Cranwell.

==Personal life==
Sayer was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1942 New Years Honours List.

In January 1929, he became engaged to May Violet Ellen Wallace-Smyth daughter of the vicar of Bures, north Essex. They were married on 7 June 1930 at Holy Innocents Church, Lamarsh in north Essex.

<doc id="1125654" wikidata="Q383109" url="?curid=1125654" title="Flag of Queensland">
<text>The state flag of Queensland is a British Blue Ensign with the state badge on a white disc added in the fly. The badge is a light blue Maltese Cross with a Saint Edward&#x27;s Crown in the centre of the cross. The flag dates from 1876, with minor variations, and the badge was designed by William Hemmant, the Colonial Secretary and Treasurer of Queensland in 1876.

== History ==

=== 1859 Separation Flag ===
On 10 December 1859 (also known as &quot;Proclamation Day&quot; in Queensland), over 180 days after Queensland&#x27;s formal separation from the Colony of New South Wales, the Separation Flag was flown at 08:00 in Brisbane under a twenty-one gun salute, marking the proclamation of Queensland&#x27;s separation from New South Wales. The flag was described as being sky blue with the St George&#x27;s Cross and union in the corner. The flag was also known as the &quot;Moreton Bay Flag&quot;.

=== 1870 proposed flag ===
In 1865, the British admiralty stated that colonial vessels should fly the British Blue Ensign defaced with the state badge. As Queensland did not have a badge at this time, one depicting Queen Victoria on a blue disc surrounded by the name &quot;Queensland&quot; was suggested. However, this proved to be too difficult to reproduce, leading to new design being considered.

=== 1876–1963 ===

As the previous design was found to be unworkable, a new design was submitted to the Admiralty for approval:
The Maltese Cross impaled with the Crown was chosen out of four proposed designs to replace Victoria&#x27;s head.

===1963 to present===
Following Queen Elizabeth II decision to use the Crown of St Edward as her royal cypher, in 1963 the State Emblem and the State flag was once again updated with the design of the crown following the preference of the monarch.

However, it is unknown whether this tradition will continue into the future, as despite King Charles III choice to use the Tudor Crown on his royal cypher, the Queensland government stated on 4 May 2023, that they have no plans to update the State Emblem or flag.

== Government distribution ==
The Queensland Government offers free state flags to eligible organisations including:

* Schools
* Recognised youth organisations
* Community service groups
* Charities
* Sporting clubs
* Local government authorities.

<doc id="1125657" wikidata="Q3102119" url="?curid=1125657" title="SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs (video game)">
<text>SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs is a tactical third-person shooter video game developed by Zipper Interactive and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2.

In addition to the 12 offline single player missions, &quot;SOCOM&quot; also featured online play via the Internet. &quot;SOCOM&quot; uses a USB headset for its speech recognition commands offline, and allows voice chat with teammates when playing online; this was the first game for the PlayStation 2 to use the headset. 

The online servers for this game, along with other PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable &quot;SOCOM&quot; titles, were shut down on August 31, 2012.

==Gameplay==
The player leads a four-man team (three AI-controlled teammates) of United States Navy SEALs through 12 missions in four regions: Alaska, Thailand, Congo, and Turkmenistan in the then-future of 2006 and 2007. In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases.

The player character&#x27;s codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates&#x27; codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer (the Able element), while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.

Before each mission, the player may choose new equipment for themself and their teammates. Usually this consists of a primary and secondary weapon, along with two pieces of equipment like extra ammunition, explosives and so on. However, on some missions it is required that a team member carries a particular piece of equipment, such as C4 for destroying walls or vehicles. Characters are very vulnerable to enemy fire and may die after just a couple of shots, depending on where one is hit and what weapon is used. It is required that at least one teammate survives along with the player, if not the mission fails.

At the end of each mission, the player is given a rating based on stealth, accuracy and teamwork. These ratings are alphabetical, with &quot;A&quot; being the highest grade. Once the game is completed for the first time, the player unlocks a higher difficulty and can try to complete the game again and again with a progressively higher difficulty.

===Online gameplay===
Online players choose one of two sides: SEALs or terrorists. Maps consist of three types: suppression (eliminate all members of the opposite team), extraction (rescue hostages) and demolition (capture a satchel and destroy the opposite team&#x27;s base). &quot;SOCOM&quot;, &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Confrontation&quot; and &quot;SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; for the PlayStation 3 are the only games in the series that do not support LAN play (local multiplayer). In addition to the specific game type, any of the three game modes may be won by eliminating all members of the opposing team. The online features of the game, however, are no longer accessible.

==Plot==
On November 27, 2006, a U.S. Navy SEAL fireteam consisting of Kahuna, Boomer, Spectre, and Jester is sent in to neutralize an emerging terrorist threat. A new group calling itself the Iron Brotherhood, made up of former Spetsnaz operatives, is using a barge as a base for buying and transporting weapons. They are making their trades with a known black market organization, the Zemy, and the two are rendezvousing in international waters off the coast of Alaska. The team are to eliminate the terrorists, gather intel, and scuttle the freighter. With the intel that the SEALs gathered, SOCOM is able to locate the Brotherhood&#x27;s headquarters, a ghost town in Alaska. The team is tasked with securing the compound, destroying any weapon caches that are present, and detaining a terrorist named Kola Petrenko, codename Pincushion. Information from Pincushion revealed that the Brotherhood has taken control of an oil platform in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Most of the oil workers had been killed, but some are being held captive by the terrorists. The Brotherhood is also threatening to destroy the platform, which would result in a disastrous oil spill. The SEALs are sent in to infiltrate the platform and neutralize all threats, including the Brotherhood&#x27;s leader, Aleksei Borisova, codename Spectrum. They are successful in taking down all of the terrorists and defusing all bombs on board.

In Thailand, a group calling themselves the Riddah Rouge, led by a man named Sudarak Thongkon, has acquired sensitive and highly valuable biological data from a smuggler out of Sri Lanka. The terrorists murder him and his crew, then offload the data and move it deep into the jungles of Thailand. With a potential biological threat on their soil, the Thai government requests for international assistance, and the United States responds by sending in the SEALs. Kahuna&#x27;s team are inserted into the area and proceed to travel upriver to intercept and retrieve the data. After moving from one island to another and neutralizing numerous patrols, the team finds some documents. Unfortunately, only half of the bio data is among them as the other half had been moved elsewhere. With the bio data in their possession, the Riddah Rouge has taken the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand and his wife hostage. The terrorists demand ransom money and threaten to execute the two if their demands are not met. Intelligence tracks their movements and are able to locate the hostages at an abandoned temple in the jungles of Hohn Kaen. The team move in under cover of night and safely extract the Ambassador and his wife. While no ransom is paid for the pair, the Riddah Rouge manage to manufacture a small amount of biological agent. Their plan is to use the agents to destabilize the Thai government. The SEALs are assigned to assault another abandoned temple. While there, the team either captures or kills Thongkon, codename Bad Dog, and secures the biological agents. With their leader in custody, the Riddah Rouge disbanded.

In the Congo, a new mercenary organization known as Preemptive Strike has established a base of operations deep in the jungle. They are recruiting European mercenaries and are actively stockpiling weapons and ammunition. Concerned about this new threat, the Congolese government has requested aid from the United States. The SEALs are sent in to recon and collect intel about the group. After disabling communications and destroying the enemy munitions in their staging area, the team finds out that the remaining mercenaries have ambushed and captured a patrol of U.S. Marines. The marines are being held at the mercenary base camp where they are being tortured for information. The SEALs are able to rescue the POWs and eliminate the mercenary leader Magnus, but not before finding out that one of the captive Marines is missing, having been moved to an abandoned German bunker built during World War I which contains a network of tunnels and pillboxes. This complex is no match for the SEALs however, and they successfully liberate the final Marine with the help of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets firing missiles at designated pillboxes.

In Turkmenistan, members of a terrorist group, the Allah Sadikahu, have attained several portable nuclear devices from various black market organizations. An informant named Basim Maccek, codename Mr. Pickle, has knowledge about the nuclear devices moving through the region, but has gotten himself captured in the process. He is imprisoned in a Turkmen Detention Center in the mountains and the SEALs are sent in to release, escort, and extract the informant. The recovered informant confirms the presence of two suitcase nukes in Turkmenistan and their location. The Sadikahu have concealed the devices in a desert cave network close to the Afghan border. With no time to lose, the team travels to the nukes&#x27; location. After an intensive firefight, the team manages to destroy the nukes and the cave system. The Sadikahu&#x27;s ruthless leader Mullah Bahir Al-Qadi, however, is not present at the caves. He and his brother Imad have retreated to a deserted bombed city in central Turkmenistan. Kahuna&#x27;s team is once again sent in to find and neutralize the Al-Qadi brothers. The SEALs fight against countless terrorist defenders and race against the clock as Mullah and Imad Al-Qadi, codename Fat Cat and Kitten, call for helicopters to come and extract them.

In the end, both brothers are killed and the mission is completed.

==Development==

The game was in development for three years.

==Reception==
&quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; received &quot;generally positive&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best PlayStation 2 game of August 2002. It won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Online Game on PlayStation 2&quot; award, and a runner-up for &quot;Best Sound on PlayStation 2&quot;.

By July 2006, &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; had sold 1.4 million copies and earned $82 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 34th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.

<doc id="1125666" wikidata="Q559518" url="?curid=1125666" title="Right of initiative (legislative)">
<text>The right of (legislative) initiative is the constitutionally defined power to propose a new law (bill) in a legislature.

The right of initiative is usually given to both the government (executive) and individual legislators.

However, some systems may restrict this right to legislators acting alone or with others (such as in the United States) or to the government (such as in the European Union). This, however, does not preclude the executive from suggesting the introduction of certain laws to their backers in the legislature, or even from members of the executive from introducing laws by themselves in systems that allow simultaneous membership in the executive and the legislature.

Bicameral legislatures may restrict or have the right of initiative restricted to the members of the lower house only, or allow members of the upper house to introduce bills to the lower house (such as in the Czech Republic).

== Groups with a right of initiative ==
Almost all countries give the right of legislative initiative to members of parliament, either as individuals or as part of a group. Depending on the country, other groups of people may have the ability to initiate legislation. These include the following:

* Heads of state, such as a president or a monarch
* Heads of government that are not also the head of state, such as a prime minister
* A cabinet as a whole, or an individual government minister
* Political parties
* Courts and government agencies
* Local governments, normally present in a federal system
* Academic institutions
* Businesses and companies
* Groups of citizens, normally with a signature quota
* Individual citizens alone

== Netherlands ==
The power to make a legislative proposal in the Netherlands is held by the members of the Dutch government and other members of the House of Representatives. Both have the &quot;right of initiative&quot;. The right of initiative is regulated in the Dutch Constitution:

The Senate has no right of initiative as an independent body. There is, however, a right of initiative for the joint meeting of the States General (House and Senate together).

The right of initiative of the Crown and the States General had already been formulated in Article 46 of the &quot;Constitution for the United Netherlands of 1814&quot;:

In more than 95% of all cases, the government takes the lead in drafting a law. A member of the House of Representatives can receive assistance from the Legislation Bureau. MPs will make more frequent use of their right of amendment, or the right to propose amendments to a bill.

== Belgium ==

In Belgium, the executive (officially the king and his ministers, but the king has no actual power) as well as members of the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives have the right of initiative. The executive must always exercise its right of initiative in the House (according to Belgian separation of powers, the executive also has the right of initiative). 

If the Senate or the House exercises its right of initiative, it is referred to as a &quot;law proposal&quot; (&quot;wetsvoorstel&quot; in Dutch, &quot;proposition de loi&quot; in French). If the executive does so, this is referred to as a &quot;law project&quot; (&quot;wetsontwerp&quot; in Dutch, &quot;projet de loi&quot; in French). If the executive submits a bill, it must be sent to the Legislation Department of the Council of State for advice. This is a substantial requirement of form, i.e. non-compliance can lead to the annulment of the law.

==France==

In France, ministerial bills are called &quot;law projects&quot; and parliament&#x27;s bills are called &quot;law proposals&quot;.

===Law projects===
In France, bills are proposed by the government. One of the ministers propose the bill to those concerned by his or her application. Then, if the different ministers agree, the bill is sent to the &quot;secrétariat général du gouvernement&quot; and then to the Conseil d&#x27;État, the Council of Ministers, Parliament, and so on...
The Conseil d&#x27;État (and sometimes the Constitutional Council) has the duty to advise the government on projects of law.

===Law proposals===
Any MP can propose a law to Parliament.
Law proposals, unlike law projects, can be directly deposed if they do not increase the state&#x27;s expenditure.

Both kind of bills can first be deposed either to the Senate or the National Assembly

Only 10% of laws that are passed are proposed by Members of Parliament.
This is mainly because the government has several means to limit the power of Parliament:
the Government fixes most of the agenda of both chambers, and 
the Government can, under certain conditions, prevent Parliament from modifying its texts.

The legislative initiative of Parliament has both good and bad points.
The principal criticism is that &quot;lobbies&quot; could persuade Parliament to satisfy them before other citizens.
On the other hand, legislative initiative is the best way for Parliament to defend itself against possible encroachments to its power.

==European Union==
The European Commission has a near monopoly for legislative initiative, whereas in many parliamentary systems there is a mechanism whereby members of the parliament may introduce bills. This ranges from insignificant in the UK Parliament (see private members&#x27; bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom), through quite significant in the Israeli Knesset, to being the only way bills can be introduced in the US Congress. In most parliaments, the ability of members to introduce legislation is common practice because parliament and government are constructed as antagonist under the system of separation of powers. Under the Treaty of Maastricht enhanced by the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has an indirect right of legislative initiative that allows it to ask the Commission to submit a proposal, though to reject the request the Commission only needs to &quot;inform the European Parliament of the reasons&quot;. Member states also have an indirect right of legislative initiative concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

Over 80% of all proposals by the Commission were initially requested by other bodies.

Some politicians, including Jean-Pierre Chevènement and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, feel that the Commission&#x27;s monopoly on legislative initiative prevents the emergence or development of real democratic debate.

Citizens also have legislative initiative in the EU by the procedure of a European Citizens&#x27; Initiative, in which at least a million signatures by EU citizens need to be obtained in at least a quarter of EU member states.

<text>MY DISCO (stylized in capitals) is an Australian music group formed in 2003 by brothers Ben and Liam Andrews. It includes members from Agents of Abhorrence and Clann Zú.

==Background==
MY DISCO was formed in 2003 in Melbourne, Australia, by brothers Ben and Liam Andrews (both originally from London) and Rohan Rebeiro. Their name comes from a song by Big Black.

Residing between London and Melbourne since 2010, their first public appearance was performed at The Good Morning Captain, a café and performance space in Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne. MY DISCO became known for its unconventional venues, having organized performances on side-walks, in galleries, and warehouses.

The band founded their own record label, &quot;Crashing Jets&quot;, to release their own music. Following a limited cassette release, the band released a 7&quot;, &quot;Collapse of an Erratic Lung&quot; (November 2003), and a 10&quot;, &quot;Language of Numbers&quot; (September 2004, also available as a CD), both on &quot;Crashing Jets&quot;.

November 2003 marked their first Australian tour. The band soon became renowned for their arduous tour ethic, demonstrated in extensive tours of remote areas of Australia and Southeast Asia.

After a hiatus due to Liam Andrews&#x27; diagnosis of Hodgkin&#x27;s Disease, their debut album &quot;Cancer&quot; was released in 2006. They toured the album to the United States, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as appearing at the Meredith Music Festival in Victoria.

In October 2007, the band recorded their second album, entitled &quot;Paradise&quot;, at Electrical Audio with Steve Albini of Shellac. An extensive world tour in support of the album followed, including a performance at SXSW in Austin, Texas.

In 2010, the band signed to the New York record label, Temporary Residence Limited and released their third album, &quot;Little Joy&quot;. Recording started in March 2010 at Electrical Audio with once again Steve Albini as engineer. The album received the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for &#x27;Best Hard Rock or Punk Album&#x27; in 2011.

In 2015, MY DISCO released their fourth studio album, entitled &quot;Severe&quot;. It was their first studio album to be recorded with film composer Cornel Wilzcek at Electric Dreams Studio in Melbourne, Australia. &quot;Severe&quot; captures the subtleness and high concentration levels of MY DISCO&#x27;s renowned minimalist approach to dark and heavy instrumentation. Previously known for their stark and consistent rhythmic structures, &quot;Severe&quot; takes on a new approach of aggravated tonal darkness, exploring a heavily affected extremely dynamic writing style. &quot;Severe&quot; was nominated and shortlisted into the final for the AMP Australian Music Prize.

Following the release of &quot;Severe&quot;, the band released a Remix 12-inch on Karl O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s label Downwards Records featuring Regis and Lustmord reworking the tracks &quot;1991&quot; and &quot;Our Decade.&quot;

In 2018, MY DISCO recorded their 5th studio album with Boris Wilsdorf at Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s studio andereBaustelle in Berlin. Their most uncompromising recording to date, the album was released through Downwards Records. Written over a two-week period during Berlin winter 2018, the band decided to let their surroundings shape the sound of their new material. Recorded in a place that has seen Einstürzende Neubauten, Keiji Heino and Pan Sonic pen works, the band became immersed within the confines of the space and immediate surroundings and set to create a record that has become a dark and intense departure from their previous releases.

Following the release of Environment, the band were invited to perform at the 2019 Berlin Atonal at the Kraftwerk Berlin.

<doc id="1125669" wikidata="Q2915476" url="?curid=1125669" title="Labor rights">
<text>Labor rights or workers&#x27; rights are both legal rights and human rights relating to labor relations between workers and employers. These rights are codified in national and international labor and employment law. In general, these rights influence working conditions in the relations of employment. One of the most prominent is the right to freedom of association, otherwise known as the right to organize. Workers organized in trade unions exercise the right to collective bargaining to improve working conditions.

== Labor background ==
Throughout history, workers claiming some sort of right have attempted to pursue their interests. During the Middle Ages, the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in England expressed demand for better wages and working conditions. One of the leaders of the revolt, John Ball, famously argued that people were born equal saying, &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?&quot; Laborers often appealed to traditional rights. For instance, English peasants fought against the enclosure movement, which took traditionally communal lands and made them private.

The British Parliament passed the Factory Act 1833 which stated that children under the age of 9 could not work, children aged 9–13 could only work 8 hours a day, and children aged 14–18 could only work for 12 hours a day.

Labor rights are a relatively new addition to the modern corpus of human rights. The modern concept of labor rights dates to the 19th century after the creation of labor unions following the industrialization processes. Karl Marx stands out as one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for workers&#x27; rights. His philosophy and economic theory focused on labor issues and advocates his economic system of socialism, a society that would be ruled by the workers. Many of the social movements for the rights of the workers were associated with groups influenced by Marx such as the socialists and communists. More moderate democratic socialists and social democrats supported workers&#x27; interests as well. More recent workers&#x27; rights advocacy has focused on the particular role, exploitation, and needs of women workers, and of increasingly mobile global flows of casual, service, or guest workers.

== Core labor standards ==
Identified by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, core labor standards are &quot;widely recognized to be of particular importance&quot;. They are universally applicable, regardless of whether the relevant conventions have been ratified, the level of development of a country or cultural values. These standards are composed of qualitative, not quantitative, standards and do not establish a particular level of working conditions, wages or health and safety standards. They are not intended to undermine the comparative advantage that developing countries may hold. Core labor standards are important human rights and are recognized in widely ratified international human rights instruments including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC), the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 193 parties, and the ICCPR with 160 parties. They have been incorporated into different provisions that are related to labor in soft law instruments such as the UN&#x27;s Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines, and the ILO MNE Declaration.

The core labor standards are:
* Freedom of association: workers are able to join trade unions that are independent of government and employer influence.
* The right to collective bargaining: workers may negotiate with employers collectively, as opposed to individually.
* The prohibition of all forms of forced labor: includes security from prison labor and slavery and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress.
* Elimination of the worst forms of child labor: implementing a minimum working age and certain working condition requirements for children.
* Non-discrimination in employment: equal pay for equal work.

Very few ILO member countries have ratified all of these conventions due to domestic constraints yet as these rights are also recognized in the UDHR, and form a part of customary international law they are committed to respecting these rights. For a discussion on the incorporation of these core labor rights into the mechanisms of the World Trade Organization, see Labour standards in the World Trade Organization. There are many other issues outside of this core, in the UK employee rights include the right to employment particulars, an itemized pay statement, a disciplinary process at which they have the right to be accompanied, daily breaks, rest breaks, paid holidays, and more.

== Labor rights issues by topics ==
Aside from the right to organize, labor movements have campaigned on various other issues that may be said to relate to labor rights. The labor movement began to improve the working conditions of the workers. Dating back to 1768 the first strike of the New York journeyman tailors protested a wage reduction. This marked the beginning of the movement. Approaching the 19th century, labor unions were formed to improve the working conditions for all of workers. They fought for better wages, reasonable hours, and safer working conditions. The labor movement led efforts to stop child labor, give health benefits, and provide aid to workers who were injured or retired. The following are explained more in the following sections.

=== Hour limits ===
Many labor movement campaigns have to do with limiting hours in the workplace. 19th century labor movements campaigned for an eight-hour day. Worker advocacy groups have also sought to limit work hours, making a working week of 40 hours or less standard in many countries. A 35-hour workweek was established in France in 2000, although this standard has been considerably weakened since then. Workers may agree with employers to work for longer, but the extra hours are payable overtime. In the European Union the working week is limited to a maximum of 48 hours &quot;including&quot; overtime (see also Working Time Directive 2003).

=== Workplace conditions ===
Labor rights advocates have worked to improve workplace conditions that meet established standards. During the Progressive Era, the United States began workplace reforms, which received publicity boosts from Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot; and events such as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Labor advocates and other groups often criticize production facilities with poor working conditions as sweatshops and occupational health hazards and campaign for better labor practices and recognition of workers&#x27; rights throughout the world.

=== Safety and social sustainability ===
Recent initiatives in the field of sustainability have included a focus on social sustainability, which includes promoting workers&#x27; rights and safe working conditions, prevention of human trafficking, and elimination of illegal child labor from the sustainably sourced products and services. Organizations such as the U.S. Department of Labor and Department of State have released studies on products that have been identified as using child labor and industries using or funded by human trafficking. Labor rights are defined internationally by sources such as the Norwegian Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DIFI) and the International Finance Corporation performance standards.

=== Living wage ===
The labor movement pushes for guaranteed minimum wage laws, and there are continuing negotiations about increases to the minimum wage. However, opponents see minimum wage laws as limiting employment opportunities for unskilled and entry-level workers.

The benefits and costs of foreign direct investments on labor rights are often argued. Payton and Woo&#x27;s study shows that even though &quot;workers may not see drastic increases in minimum wages but they will benefit marginally from better enforcement of existing minimum wage laws or other protections granted in law, gradually improving overall working conditions, as more FDI flows in.&quot;

=== Globalization ===
In March 2004, the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization issued a report called &quot;A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All&quot;. The report acknowledges how potential globalization can affect labor rights. Reforming globalization will require cooperation not only within the country but also at the global level. It suggests political authorities to &quot;renew their attention to global solidarity&quot;.

Workers&#x27; rights advocates have been concerned with how globalization can impact labor rights in different countries. Some international agencies and global corporations see strong enforcement will limit a country&#x27;s economic growth. As companies outsource their work to workers from lower-wage countries, governments will relax their regulations to attract businesses. As a result, poor countries implement a lower labor rights standard to compete with other countries. Layna Mosley&#x27;s study shows that collective labor rights have declined since the recent global expansion started. By having multiple countries sign agreements and treaties, labor rights are able to be protected across the globe. However, some countries sign it even though they are not planning to follow the rules. Therefore, there might be room for labor rights practices to suffer.

However, some argued that globalization can improve labor rights enforcement by responding to other country&#x27;s demands. Governments will act in their national interests, so when an important trading country urges for strong labor rights enforcement, they will act accordingly.
==Labor rights issues by demographics==

=== Child labor ===

Labor rights advocates have also worked to combat child labor. They see child labor as exploitative, and often economically damaging. Child labor opponents often argue that working children are deprived of an education. In 1948 and then again in 1989, the United Nations declared that children have a right to social protection.

It is hard for children to fight for their basic rights, especially in the workplace. They are often under-treated. Employers take advantage of child labor because they lack the ability to bargain collectively and compromise to work at an unpleasant workplace. Almost 95% of child labor occurs in developing countries. An example of an industry in which instances of child labor lead to severe injury or death that have been noted are cobalt mining in the DRC as well as copper mining in Zambia, where children were reported to be participating in all forms of mining at the expense of their education. There is a growing concern that the rising demand for resources that involve child labor for industries such as the production of electric vehicle batteries, will only increase labor rights violations. In India and Pakistan, children work long hours in various industries because of the debt their parents incurred. Poor families sometimes rely on their kids&#x27; income to pay bills. In Egypt, about 1.5 million kids under 14 years old are working even though there are child-protective labor laws.

==== Child labor in the United States ====

In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) restricts the employment of children. The FLSA defines the minimum age for employment to 14 years for non-agricultural jobs with restrictions on hours, restricts the hours for youth under the age of 16, and prohibits the employment of children under the age of 18 in occupations deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor.

In 2007, Massachusetts updated its child labor laws that required all minors to have work permits.

=== Pregnant employees ===

The Employment Protection Consolidation Act (EPCA) has established four fundamental regulations for women&#x27;s employment rights. Firstly, there is the provision of Statutory Maternity Pay, which ensures that a minimum payment is made during the leave period. Secondly, there is the right to maternity leave, which guarantees that women can take time off work and return to their job afterward. Additionally, women have the right to be reinstated to their original position. Finally, the EPCA has reinforced unfair dismissal rights.

=== Migrant workers ===
Legal migrant workers are sometimes abused. For instance, migrants have faced a number of alleged abuses in the United Arab Emirates (including Dubai). Human Rights Watch lists several problems including &quot;nonpayment of wages, extended working hours without overtime compensation, unsafe working environments resulting in death and injury, squalid living conditions in labor camps, and withholding of passports and travel documents by employers. Despite laws against the practice, employers confiscate migrant workers&#x27; passports. Without their passports, workers cannot switch jobs or return home.
These workers have little recourse for labor abuses, but conditions have been improving. Labor and social welfare minister Ali bin Abdullah al-Kaabi has undertaken a number of reforms to help improve labor practices in his country.

The United Arab Emirates was condemned in a report issued in April 2021 by the Democracy Centre for Transparency calling out the nation for its abuse and discrimination of foreigners and expatriates against Emirati citizens. According to DCT, foreigners and expatriates in the UAE are often subjected to gender and wage discrimination, racialization, trafficking, and forced labor. As per the research conducted by the DCT, these issues remain unreported due to the threat and intimidation from their employers in the form of job loss or fabricated criminal charges. The discrimination and abuse have reportedly continued despite the easing of the Kafala system in the Emirate. The DCT concluded its report urging the UAE to address the issues and put an end to the racial hierarchy and discrimination against non-citizens.

Koelnmesse, the company responsible for managing the pavilion representing Germany at the Expo 2020 reportedly signed an agreement with the Emirati Transguard Group for laundry, cleaning, and security services. Rights groups claim that during the signing of a framework agreement between the two firms, evidence assuring human rights due diligence was overlooked. It is said that the firm withheld the passports and wages of the workers earning relatively lesser than the minimum wage and terminated them from the service without notice.

In neighboring countries such as Qatar, there is a similar problem. Qatar has received a lot of criticism over the way it treats its workers, including those that have worked on FIFA World Cup projects. 

=== Undocumented workers ===
The right to equal treatment, regardless of gender, origin and appearance, religion, sexual orientation, is also seen by many as one of the workers&#x27; rights. Discrimination in the workplace is illegal in many countries, but some see the wage gap between genders and other groups as a persistent problem.

Many migrant workers are not getting basic labor rights mainly because they do not speak the local language, regardless of legal status. Some have noticed that they are not getting the correct amount of money on their paycheck while others are underpaid.

==== Undocumented workers in the United States ====
The National Labor Relations Act recognizes undocumented laborers as employees. However, the supreme court case &quot;Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB&quot; established that backpay could not be awarded to unlawfully fired undocumented employees due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In this court decision, it was also stated that the U.S. would support FLSA and MSPA, without regard to whether or not someone is documented. Undocumented workers also still have legal protection against discrimination based on national origin. The decision of the Hoffman supreme court case has primarily affected undocumented laborers by preventing them from getting backpay and/or reinstatement.

While no undocumented individual is technically able to work in the United States legally, undocumented workers make up 5% of the workforce. In the U.S., people who were born outside of the country tend to work in riskier jobs and have a higher chance of encountering death on the job. The low-wage sectors, which many undocumented people work in, have the highest rates of wage and hour violation. Estimates claim that 31% of undocumented people work in service jobs. Restaurant work in particular has a 12% rate of undocumented workers.

Undocumented people can and have joined labor unions, and are even credited by a 2008 dissertation for &quot;reinvigorating&quot; the labor movement. Because the NLRA protects undocumented workers, it protects their right to organize. However, the NLRA excludes workers that are agricultural, domestic, independent contractors, governmental, or related to their employers. The right to speak up against labor abuses was protected further by an immigration reform bill in 2013 with the POWER act, which intended to protect employees who spoke out against labor practices from facing detention or deportation.

However, labor unions are not necessarily welcoming of immigrant workers. Within unions, there have been internal struggles, such as when Los Angeles immigrant janitors reorganized service workers. Being a part of the union does not necessarily address all the needs of immigrant workers, and thus winning power within the union is the first step for immigrant workers to address their needs.

Immigrant workers often mobilize beyond unions, by campaigning in their communities on intersectional issues of immigration, discrimination, and police misconduct.

=== Unionized workers ===
Labor unions formed throughout the industries. Labor unions in the crafts discovered difficulty in forming labor unions at different skill levels. These skill groups often got divided into racial and sexist ways. In 1895, the white-only International Association of Machinists affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which was founded in 1881. Entering the 20th century African Americans moved from the South into the North only to find that there was discrimination in economic opportunities. Racial stereotypes were used to divide the working class and create segregation. This eventually led to the creation of black codes and Jim Crow laws to limit the ability of African Americans to create a living for themselves. The Jim Crow laws passed in the 1800s were laws that forbade African Americans from living in white neighborhoods, along with segregation in public places. these were enforced for public pools, phone booths, hospitals, asylums, jails and residential homes for the elderly and handicapped and more.

===Neurodiversity===

Neurodiversity considerations may include people on the autism spectrum, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD, also known as dyspraxia) or dyslexia. Many consider the term to be psuedoscientific, and a form of phrenology.

== Measurement of Labor Rights ==
There are several indices that measure labor rights produced by various organizations. Some focus on collective bargaining and freedom of association including in datasets produced by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and Penn State. Others, such as data produced by the V-Dem Institute and UCLA&#x27;s World Policy Analysis Center focus on other components such as employment discrimination, child labor, and forced labor. 

The ITUC produces the Global Rights Index on an annual basis which rates &quot;countries depending on their compliance with collective labor rights and document violations by governments and employers of internationally recognized rights.&quot; The ILO produces the data for Sustainable Development Goal 8.8.2, which measures the &quot;Level of national compliance with labor rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on International Labour Organization (ILO) textual sources and national legislation, by sex and migrant status. In the past, Penn State&#x27;s Center for Global Workers’ Rights has produced a set of labor rights indicators which use a similar methodology to the ILO, but have wider country coverage.

The V-Dem Institute produces a wide range of data on civil rights and democracy. This includes data on the prevalence of forced labor and data on civil society organizations, including trade unions. UCLA&#x27;s World Policy Analysis Center maintains a database on a range of global legal standards including women&#x27;s rights, disability rights, child labor, and employment discrimination.

<doc id="1125673" wikidata="Q3496369" url="?curid=1125673" title="Stagecoach in Oxfordshire">
<text>Stagecoach in Oxfordshire is the trading name of Thames Transit Ltd. It is a bus operator serving the county of Oxfordshire, England. Since 1997 has been a subsidiary of Stagecoach Group, and since February 2021 it has been part of Stagecoach West, managed from the latter&#x27;s headquarters in Gloucester.

==History==
In 1987 Harry Blundred, a former bus driver and controller from Devon, founded both Thames Transit and the Oxford Tube. In 1997 Stagecoach Group bought both operations from Blundred and merged them with Stagecoach Midland Red.

Stagecoach South Midlands operated four brands:
*&quot;Oxford Tube&quot; for express buses between Oxford and London Victoria
*&quot;Stagecoach in Banbury&quot; for local buses in and around Banbury
*&quot;Stagecoach in Oxford&quot; for local buses in and around Oxford
*&quot;Stagecoach in Warwickshire&quot; for local buses in Warwickshire

In July 2002 the Banbury and Oxford brands were merged as &quot;Stagecoach in Oxfordshire&quot;. In March 2004 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire and Stagecoach in Warwickshire were split into two divisions with those names.

Stagecoach buses in Oxford historically competed with local buses operated by the Oxford Bus Company, but in 2010 it was announced that Oxford Bus Company and Stagecoach in Oxfordshire, in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council, had agreed a Bus Quality Partnership as enabled by the Local Transport Act 2008. The partnership would improved multi-operator ticketing across the City and co-ordinate bus timetables on the four busiest shared routes.

On 15 July 2010 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire introduced a fleet of 26 Alexander Dennis Enviro400H diesel-electric hybrid buses on Oxford – Cowley – Blackbird Leys route 1 and Oxford – Kidlington routes 7A/7B (now 2/2A/2B). Double deckers were chosen over single deckers as a result of the co-ordinated timetables and reduced frequencies to be introduced under the quality partnership. As newer buses joined the Oxfordshire fleet, the Enviro400H hybrids were transferred first to Oxford – Rose Hill route 3, then to Kidlington – Headington route 700 and now to Oxford – Cowley – Headington route 10.

In October 2016 Stagecoach announced the introduction of new electronic ticket machines to enable passengers to pay by contactless payment card or by smartphone using Apple Pay or Google Pay. Stagecoach in Oxfordshire was the first Stagecoach division to receive these new machines for both local services and the Oxford Tube, making Stagecoach in Oxfordshire the first major operator to accept contactless payments outside London.

In February 2021 Stagecoach Group announced that Stagecoach in Oxfordshire would merge with Stagecoach West as part of a revised business structure.

==Oxford Tube==
The Oxford Tube currently operates a fleet of 32 Plaxton Panorama double decker coaches on limited stops services between Oxford and London Victoria.

On 3 March 2014 Stagecoach Group announced its biggest vehicle order to date. Costing Stagecoach over £100 million in total, it included 26 new VanHool TX Astromega coaches to operate the Oxford Tube service. The first of the new coaches entered service on 16 July 2014 with the entire fleet following shortly after. The new coaches increased comfort and facilities for passengers including more leg room, 4G WiFi, power sockets and USB ports in selected seats and a brand new audio information system providing passengers with departure and arrival information and the top deck also features a panoramic glass sun roof allowing more natural light into the coach.

In 2020, Stagecoach announced that it would replace their current Tube fleet with 34 new Plaxton Panorama vehicles, built on Volvo B11RLE chassis.

In 2023, Stagecoach added services via High Wycombe Coachway, and also starting in Carterton and operating via Witney and Eynsham.

== Stagecoach Gold ==
Stagecoach in Oxfordshire operates several routes under the premium Stagecoach Gold brand. The Stagecoach Gold brand was introduced in Oxfordshire in 2009 with the creation of the first S-Series (Superior Series) routes. The Stagecoach Gold brand is currently used on several long-distance routes in the county. The Gold branded buses feature a special Gold and blue coloured livery along with high-back leather seats and free on-board Wi-Fi (currently disabled due to running costs). The newer Gold vehicles used on routes S7/S3, and S9 also include USB charging ports. It is to be noted however, that often the bus routes will not be operated by their &quot;Gold&quot; branded buses.

In addition to the routes operated by Stagecoach in Oxfordshire, Stagecoach West also operates route S6 which runs between Swindon and Oxford via Faringdon.

=== S3/NS3 – Chipping Norton/Charlbury to Oxford ===
In 2008 route 20, operating between Chipping Norton and Oxford, and route 20A, operating between Charlbury and Oxford, were combined to create route S3 operating alternately Oxford – Woodstock – Charlbury and Oxford – Woodstock – Chipping Norton. The service serves Blenheim Palace. Route S3 was upgraded to Stagecoach Gold status in September 2012 with the delivery of nine new Stagecoach Gold specification ADL Enviro400 bodied Scania N230UD buses for the service.

=== S5/NS5 – Bicester to Oxford ===
In 2009 routes 27/27A/27B/X27 between Bicester and Oxford were rebranded as route S5. The route was subsequently upgraded to Stagecoach Gold in January 2012 with a fleet of 11 new Gold branded Enviro400 buses.

=== S7 – Witney to Oxford ===
Route 7 was a new route created in January 2017 between Woodstock and Oxford via Kidlington and . Route 7 was given Stagecoach Gold status with brand new Enviro400 MMC vehicles delivered to Stagecoach in Oxfordshire in December 2016. This service now has been extended to Witney from Woodstock and has been renamed the S7 to match the Superior branding.

=== S9/NS9 – Wantage to Oxford ===
Routes X30, 31, and 34 between Wantage and Oxford were upgraded to Stagecoach Gold status in January 2017. The services received new Stagecoach Gold specification Enviro400 MMC vehicles that were delivered to Stagecoach in December 2016. Routes 31 and X30 were renumbered S8 &amp; S9 respectively on 22 October 2017. In January 2022, services S8 and 34 passed to Thames Travel, the S8 was renumbered X1, furthermore the S9 had its frequency increased to every 20 minutes on Mondays to Saturdays &amp; every 30 minutes on Sundays with funding from Oxfordshire County Council.

== National Express ==
Stagecoach Oxfordshire operated route 737 from Oxford Gloucester Green to Stansted Airport under contract to National Express from March 2007 until June 2013. This route is now operated on behalf of National Express by the Oxford Bus Company. 

== Fleet ==
As of December 2016, Stagecoach Oxfordshire operated a fleet of 176 buses.

Stagecoach Oxfordshire has a young fleet. This is partly due to Oxford&#x27;s Low Emission Zone, which allows only buses with exhaust systems of at least Euro V standard or better to serve the city centre. Stagecoach Oxfordshire has replaced most of its fleet to meet this requirement.

== Depots ==
*Banbury, Canal Street

== Incidents ==
*In the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2010 Oxford Tube coach 50226 was involved in a serious accident on the M40 after a passenger on board attempted to grab the steering wheel. No-one was seriously injured, but the vehicle ended up on its side and sustained significant damage. The vehicle was eventually repaired and returned to service.
*On 14 December 2010 a double deck bus on route S1 from Oxford to Witney was involved in a collision with a taxi on Oxford Hill junction with Cogges Hill Road in Witney. The elderly female taxi driver was freed with hydraulic cutting equipment and she was then taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital with suspected facial and leg injuries. Three passengers from the bus were taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution.
*On 14 May 2012 the engine of bus 22766 caught fire in Cumnor while on route X30 from Wantage to Oxford. No passengers were injured in this incident and the bus was eventually repaired and returned to service.
*On 4 October 2014 bus 15609 was involved in a collision with a car which resulted in both vehicles ending up in an embankment at the side of the A40 between Witney and Eynsham. As a result, the A40 was closed between Eynsham roundabout and Witney while emergency services dealt with the incident. No-one was seriously injured but a few people were taken to hospital as a precaution. The bus involved has since been repaired and returned to service.

<text>The Fighting for Mouquet Farm, also known as the Battle of Mouquet Farm was part of the Battle of the Somme and began during the Battle of Pozières (23 July – 3 September 1916). The fighting began on 23 July with attacks by the British Reserve Army. The farm was captured by the 3rd Canadian Division of the Canadian Corps on 16 September. The farm was lost to a German counter-attack, before being re-captured on 26 September during an attack by the 11th (Northern) Division during the Battle of Thiepval Ridge Number 16 Section of the 6th Battalion East Yorkshire (Pioneers) smoked out the last German defenders.
==Background==

===1916===
Mouquet Farm was to the right of the modern D 73 Pozières–Thiepval road, south of Grandcourt and to the south-west of Courcelette, about north-west of the high ground near Pozières. Following the fighting that had occurred around the village earlier in the year, a decision was made by the British to gain control of the ridge beyond the village to create a gap in the German lines, behind the salient that had developed around the German-held fortress of Thiepval. By capturing Mouquet Farm, the British hoped that it would destabilise the German position and enable subsequent gains.

==Battle==

===10 August – 3 September===

During the night of 10 August, parties of the 4th Australian Division of the I Anzac Corps, attacked towards the farm and managed to establish advanced posts in the valley south of the farm and to the east. Attacks were then made from a foothold in (Fabeck Trench) to the north-east and to deepen the salient near the farm. By 22 August, the 2nd Australian Division had made several more attempts on the farm and realised that the main defensive position was underground, where the Germans had excavated the cellars to create linked dug-outs. On 3 September, the 4th Australian Division attacked again with the 13th Brigade and captured much of the surface remains of the farm and trenches nearby, with hand-to-hand fighting in the ruins and underground. German counter-attacks repulsed the Australians except from a small part of , the fighting costing the Australians 

===16–26 September===
During the battle, the divisions of I Anzac Corps advanced north-west along Pozières ridge, towards Mouquet Farm, with British divisions supporting on the left. The approaches to the farm were watched by German artillery observers, who directed artillery-fire on the attackers from three sides of the salient that had developed in the lines. Many casualties were caused to the attackers as they approached the farm; in August and into September, the Australians were repulsed three times.

The Canadian Corps relieved the I Anzac Corps on 5 September. The Canadians captured part of the farm on 16 September and were then repulsed by a counter-attack. By 25 September, further attacks had captured part of the farm on the surface but the Germans still held the cellars, dug-outs and tunnels beneath. The farm was captured on 26 September by the 34th Brigade of the 11th (Northern) Division, in the general attack of the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. The 9th Lancashire Fusiliers bombed the exits of the underground positions and also managed to reach the second objective, at the west end of Trench, where German machine-gun nests had held up previous attacks. The 6th East Yorkshire (Pioneers) overwhelmed the last defenders with smoke grenades and took 

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
In the fighting around Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the I Anzac Corps suffered During its second period on the Somme, the 1st Australian Division suffered having already suffered August. The 2nd Australian Division incurred from 25 July to 7 August and another to 29 August. From 29 July to 16 August the 4th Australian Division suffered and another 27 August to 4 September.

<text>Junia Calvina was a Roman noblewoman who lived in the 1st century AD.

==Biography==
The daughter of Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, consul in 19, Calvina belonged to two patrician houses: the &quot;gens Aemilia&quot; and &quot;gens Junia&quot; respectively. She was also the great-great-granddaughter of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus on her mother&#x27;s side of the Imperial family. As such, she was also related by blood to the &quot;gens Julia&quot;, the aristocratic family of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Tacitus calls Calvina &quot;festivissima puella&quot; and the Emperor Vespasian, in one of his jokes, mentions her as living in AD 79. Seneca describes her as &quot;most celebrated of all women (she whom all called Venus).&quot;

Calvina may have been married to Gaius Sallustius Passienus Crispus and had a daughter named Sallustia Calvina with him, this woman married Publius Ostorius Scapula.

Calvina was married to Lucius Vitellius, the brother of Aulus Vitellius, in the 1st century AD. Despite, or rather because of their blood relation to the first emperor of Rome, Calvina&#x27;s close family was often persecuted by their , particularly the lineal descendants of Livia Drusilla, Augustus&#x27; third wife and the first Roman empress. Calvina and Vitellius were divorced in AD 49 following allegations of incest with her younger brother, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, who was forced to commit suicide shortly thereafter. In the same year, Calvina was exiled from Rome by Emperor Claudius, only to be recalled a decade later by his successor, Nero.

With Nero&#x27;s suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty collapsed and gave way to the Roman civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. By then Calvina was one of Augustus&#x27; few remaining descendants who survived the fall of Rome&#x27;s first Imperial dynasty.

<doc id="1125702" wikidata="Q745162" url="?curid=1125702" title="Polyarteritis nodosa">
<text>Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) affecting medium-sized muscular arteries, typically involving the arteries of the kidneys and other internal organs but generally sparing the lungs&#x27; circulation. Small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary, therefore making this &quot;rosary sign&quot; an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis. PAN is sometimes associated with infection by the hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. The condition may be present in infants.

PAN is a rare disease. With treatment, five-year survival is 80%; without treatment, five-year survival is 13%. Death is often a consequence of kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

==Signs and symptoms==
PAN may affect nearly every organ system and thus can present with a broad array of signs and symptoms. These manifestations result from ischemic damage to affected organs, often the skin, heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Constitutional symptoms are seen in up to 90% of affected individuals and include fever, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss.

Skin: The skin may show rashes, swelling, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous nodules (lumps). Skin manifestations of PAN include palpable purpura and livedo reticularis in some individuals.

Neurologic system: Nerve involvement may cause sensory changes with numbness, pain, burning, and weakness (peripheral neuropathy). Peripheral nerves are often affected, and this most commonly presents as mononeuritis multiplex, which is the most common neurologic sign of PAN. Mononeuritis multiplex develops in more than 70% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa because of damage to arteries supplying large peripheral nerves. Most cases are marked by asymmetric polyneuropathy, but progressive disease can lead to symmetric nerve involvement. Central nervous system involvement may cause strokes or seizures.

Renal system: Kidney involvement is common and often leads to death of parts of the kidney. Involvement of the renal artery, which supplies the kidneys with highly oxygenated blood, often leads to high blood pressure in about one-third of cases. deposition of protein or blood in the urine may also be seen. Almost all patients with PAN have renal insufficiency caused by renal artery narrowing, thrombosis, and infarctions.

Cardiovascular system: Involvement of the arteries of the heart may cause a heart attack, heart failure, and inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis).

Gastrointestinal system: Damage to mesenteric arteries can cause abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia, and bowel perforation. Abdominal pain may also be seen.

Musculoskeletal system: Muscle and joint aches are common.

===Complications===
* Stroke
* Heart failure resulting from cardiomyopathy and pericarditis
* Intestinal necrosis and perforation

==Causes==
PAN has no association with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, but about 30% of people with PAN have chronic hepatitis B and deposits containing HBsAg-HBsAb complexes in affected blood vessels, indicating an immune complex-mediated cause in that subset. Infection with the hepatitis C virus and HIV are occasionally discovered in people affected by PAN. PAN has also been associated with underlying hairy cell leukemia. The cause remains unknown in the remaining cases; there may be causal and clinical distinctions between classic idiopathic PAN, the cutaneous forms of PAN, and PAN associated with chronic hepatitis.
In children, cutaneous PAN is frequently associated with streptococcal infections, and positive streptococcal serology is included in the diagnostic criteria.

==Diagnosis==

No specific lab tests exist for diagnosing polyarteritis nodosa. Diagnosis is generally based on the physical examination and a few laboratory studies that help confirm the diagnosis:
:* CBC (may demonstrate an elevated white blood count)
:* ESR (elevated)
:* Perinuclear pattern of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) - not associated with &quot;classic&quot; polyarteritis nodosa, but is present in a form of the disease affecting smaller blood vessels, known as microscopic polyangiitis or leukocytoclastic angiitis
:* Tissue biopsy (reveals inflammation in small arteries, called arteritis)
:* Elevated C-reactive protein

A patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if he or she has three of the 10 signs known as the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, when a radiographic or pathological diagnosis of vasculitis is made:
:* Weight loss greater than/equal to 4.5 kg
:* Livedo reticularis (a mottled purplish skin discoloration over the extremities or torso)
:* Testicular pain or tenderness (occasionally, a site biopsied for diagnosis)
:* Muscle pain, weakness, or leg tenderness
:* Nerve disease (either single or multiple)
:* Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg (high blood pressure)
:* Elevated kidney blood tests (BUN greater than 40 mg/dL or creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL)
:* Hepatitis B (not C) virus tests positive (for surface antigen or antibody)
:* Arteriogram (angiogram) showing the arteries that are dilated (aneurysms) or constricted by the blood vessel inflammation
:* Biopsy of tissue showing the arteritis (typically inflamed arteries): The sural nerve is a frequent location for the biopsy.
In polyarteritis nodosa, small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary, therefore making this &quot;rosary sign&quot; an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis. The 1990 ACR criteria were designed for classification purposes only, but their good discriminatory performances, indicated by the initial ACR analysis, suggested their potential usefulness for diagnostic purposes as well. Subsequent studies did not confirm their diagnostic utility, demonstrating a significant dependence of their discriminative abilities on the prevalence of the various vasculitides in the analyzed populations. Recently, an original study, combining the analysis of more than 100 items used to describe patients&#x27; characteristics in a large sample of vasculitides with a computer simulation technique designed to test the potential diagnostic utility of the various criteria, proposed a set of eight positively or negatively discriminating items to be used as a screening tool for diagnosis in patients suspected of systemic vasculitis.

===Differential diagnosis===
Polyarteritis nodosa rarely affects the blood vessels of the lungs and this feature can help to differentiate it from other vasculitides that may have similar signs and symptoms (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis).

==Treatment==
Treatment involves medications to suppress the immune system, including prednisone and cyclophosphamide. When present, underlying hepatitis B virus infection should be immediately treated. In some cases, methotrexate or leflunomide may be helpful. Some patients have entered a remission phase when a four-dose infusion of rituximab is used before the leflunomide treatment is begun. Therapy results in remissions or cures in 90% of cases. Untreated, the disease is fatal in most cases. The most serious associated conditions generally involve the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. A fatal course usually involves gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, myocardial infarction, and/or kidney failure.

In case of remission, about 60% experience relapse within five years. In cases caused by hepatitis B virus, however, recurrence rate is only around 6%.

==Epidemiology==
The condition affects adults more frequently than children and males more frequently than females. Most cases occur between the ages of 40 and 60. Polyarteritis nodosa is more common in people with hepatitis B infection.

==Culture==
In the 1956 American film &quot;Bigger Than Life,&quot; the protagonist character played by James Mason is diagnosed with polyarteritis nodosa after experiencing excruciating chest pain and is treated with cortisone.

<text>Word Entertainment is a Christian faith-based entertainment company based in Nashville, Tennessee. It is owned by Curb Records. Word Entertainment represents Francesca Battistelli, for King &amp; Country, Switchfoot, Skillet, Sidewalk Prophets, Chris August, Big Daddy Weave, in addition to many others, and is home to Word Distribution, 25 Live, Word Music Publishing and Word Label Group&#x27;s Word Records and Fervent Records.

==History==
Word Records was founded in Waco, Texas, in 1951 by Jarrell McCracken, Baylor business major Henry SoRelle and radio and television executive Ted Snider. The label&#x27;s name is based on a 16-minute spoken word recording written and narrated by McCracken, the first recording released by the label, entitled &quot;The Game of Life&quot;. The 23-year-old KWTX sportscaster in Waco had read an article by Jimmy Allen, a former athlete who became a Baptist preacher, and based his recording on the article which also is called &quot;The Game of Life&quot;. The event is based on a full length match between the forces of Good and Evil with Jesus Christ and Satan coaching the two teams.

Subsequent records focused on other spoken word recordings, but Word soon branched out into southern gospel music. Early employees for the label included Tom Norfleet, Kurt Kaiser and Ralph Carmichael.

The label struggled initially until Marvin Norcross became an equity partner. By 1954, Word had become a publishing house as well.

Several subsidiary labels were started over the years: Canaan Records in the sixties, Myrrh Records (1972) and DaySpring Records in 1977, and Rejoice Records in the eighties. Two of these labels no longer exist today in their original form. The Myrrh Label was resurrected in 2005 as a praise and worship record label: Myrrh Worship.

Larry Norman&#x27;s Solid Rock Records had a distribution deal with Word from 1975 to 1980. Artists on Solid Rock included Norman, Randy Stonehill, Daniel Amos, Tom Howard and Mark Heard.

Light Records was distributed in the 1970s by Word Records before being sold to Ralph Carmichael in the 1980s.

Reunion Records signed a distribution and promotion contract in the 80s, the agreement lasted well into the 1990s. Today, Reunion Records is distributed through Provident Music Group.

Star Song was distributed by Word Records but left their distribution deal in the late 1980s to sign with Sparrow Records which was taken over by Chordant Distribution and then by EMI.

Distribution deals with other labels in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s allowed Word Records to rise, representing Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Rich Mullins, Russ and Tori Taff, Paul Smith, The Imperials, Petra, Sandi Patti, Kenny Marks, Wayne Watson, Carman, The Archers featuring Steve Archer, White Heart, Gaither Vocal Band, Bill Gaither Trio, Point of Grace, Love Song, Sweet Comfort Band, The Nelons, Happy Goodman Family featuring Rusty Goodman, Florida Boys, Guardian and other artists.

In the 1976, McCracken sold part interest in his label to the American Broadcasting Company. 10 years later, ABC merged with Capital Cities, Inc. and forced McCracken out of the company.

In 1983, Chris Christian signed a distribution deal to move his label Home Sweet Home Records from Benson Records to Word Records, today it is still active and remains under the independent ownership of Chris Christian.

From 1984 to 1990, Word was distributed in the general market by A&amp;M Records and then by Epic Records until 2002.

In 1992, Capital Cities ABC sold Word to Thomas Nelson, Inc. for $72 Million, and Nelson made two major changes—developing the present swirling W logo for book products which was unveiled in 1995, and also moving its headquarters from Waco, Texas, to its present headquarters in Nashville. Nelson split the record label and book publishing arms in 1996 when the labels were sold to Gaylord Entertainment. In an agreement with Gaylord, Thomas Nelson continued to use the &quot;Word Publishing&quot; name for its book imprint until 2002, at which time it became &quot;W Publishing Group&quot; and retained the swirling W logo. A highly controversial ad campaign introduced at the CBA convention in 2002 created litigation, settled later.

After Colin Reed took over Gaylord Entertainment in 2001, the hotelier made corporate changes at the company, including the ousting of longstanding president Roland Lundy, and sold off the Word Entertainment group to then-AOL Time Warner in 2002. In 2002, former Atlantic Records Christian division manager Barry Landis briefly took the position of president of the label group division. Word went through a period of restructuring, closing their Los Angeles music publishing office, absorbing Myrrh Records, Squint Entertainment, and Everland Entertainment into the Word Label Group, and reducing in-house staff. Curb Records also gained a stake in the company during this time. In 2004, the company was sold again as part of Time Warner divestiture of its music division, selling it to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman to form a newly independent Warner Music Group. Canaan Records was re-opened in early 2007 with Dave Clark at the helm. Canaan Records was eventually shuttered.

In March 2016, it was announced that Mike Curb acquired 100 percent of Word Entertainment (excluding the print music division, which was eventually sold to The Lorenz Corporation) from Warner Music Group. WMG has continued to distribute Word&#x27;s output for the general market. Also in 2016, it was announced that Joseph Prielozny, the former Reach Records producer, would be in charge of the hip-hop imprint which is to be called 4 Against 5. They announced the name of the imprint when they signed Steven Malcolm to their roster.

<text>Junia Lepida (c. AD 18 - 65) was a Roman noblewoman who lived in the first century.

==Life==
She was the second daughter of Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, one of the Junii Silani. Her maternal grandparents were Julia the Younger, granddaughter of the emperor Augustus, and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, consul in AD 1.

Lepida married Gaius Cassius Longinus (c. 13 BC - AD 69), a person with remarkable ancestral wealth. Cassius was praefectus urbi circa AD 27, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 30, proconsul of Asia in 40 or 41, and governor of Syria between about AD 45 and 49. Lepida and Cassius raised Lepida&#x27;s nephew, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, whose father was murdered by Empress Agrippina the Younger. In AD 66, Lepida&#x27;s husband and nephew were expelled from Rome by Emperor Nero for being a part in Gaius Calpurnius Piso&#x27;s conspiracy. Cassius was deported to Sardinia. Lepida was accused by Nero of black magic and incest with her nephew; her subsequent fate is unknown. Cassius was later rehabilitated, and recalled from exile by Vespasian.

Lepida bore Longinus two children: Cassia Longina (born c. AD 35), who married the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, and Cassius Lepidus (born c. AD 55). The latter had a daughter, Cassia Lepida (born c. AD 80), who married Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus (born c. AD 80), consul in AD 116, and proconsul of Asia in AD 132, and had a daughter, Julia Cassia Alexandra, mother of Avidius Cassius.

<doc id="1125711" wikidata="Q924138" url="?curid=1125711" title="Operation Hurricane">
<text>Operation Hurricane was the first test of a British atomic device. A plutonium implosion device was detonated on 3 October 1952 in Main Bay, Trimouille Island, in the Montebello Islands in Western Australia. With the success of Operation Hurricane, the United Kingdom became the third nuclear power, after the United States and the Soviet Union.

During the Second World War, Britain commenced a nuclear weapons project, code-named Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked on the Manhattan Project, but after the war the American government ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Lord Portal, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.

Implicit in the decision to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. The preferred site was the Pacific Proving Grounds in the US-controlled Marshall Islands. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. The Admiralty suggested that the Montebello Islands might be suitable, so the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee, sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies. The Australian government formally agreed to the islands being used as a nuclear test site in May 1951. In February 1952, Attlee&#x27;s successor, Winston Churchill, announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year.

A small fleet was assembled for Operation Hurricane under the command of Rear Admiral A. D. Torlesse; it included the escort carrier , which served as the flagship, and the LSTs &quot;Narvik&quot;, &quot;Zeebrugge&quot; and &quot;Tracker&quot;. Leonard Tyte from the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston was appointed the technical director. The bomb for Operation Hurricane was assembled (without its radioactive components) at Foulness and taken to the frigate for transport to Australia. On reaching the Montebello Islands, the five Royal Navy ships were joined by eleven Royal Australian Navy ships, including the aircraft carrier . To test the effects of a ship-smuggled atomic bomb on a port (a threat of great concern to the British at the time), the bomb was exploded inside the hull of &quot;Plym&quot;, anchored off Trimouille Island. The explosion occurred below the water line and left a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed deep and across.

==Background==
The December 1938 discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann—and its explanation and naming by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch—raised the possibility that an extremely powerful &quot;atomic bomb&quot; could be created. During the Second World War, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that instead of tonnes, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tonnes of dynamite. In response, Britain initiated an atomic bomb project, codenamed Tube Alloys.

At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project to create a combined British, American and Canadian project. The British contribution to the Manhattan Project included assistance in the development of gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York, and the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. John Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Peierls, included scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton, and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a spy for the Soviet Union. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.
With the end of the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States &quot;became very much less special&quot;. The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British saw as a joint discovery, but the terms of the Quebec Agreement remained secret. Senior members of the United States Congress were horrified when they discovered that it gave the British a veto over the use of nuclear weapons. On 9 November 1945, the new prime minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee, and the Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. They signed a Memorandum of Intention that replaced the Quebec Agreement. It made Canada a full partner, and reduced the obligation to obtain consent for the use of nuclear weapons to merely requiring consultation. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on civil and military applications of atomic energy, but the British were soon disappointed; the Americans made it clear that cooperation was restricted to basic scientific research. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) ended technical cooperation. Its control of &quot;restricted data&quot; prevented the United States&#x27; allies from receiving any information.

Attlee set up a cabinet sub-committee, the Gen 75 Committee (known informally as the &quot;Atomic Bomb Committee&quot;), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a nuclear weapons program. In October 1945, it accepted a recommendation that responsibility be placed within the Ministry of Supply. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply on 1 November 1945. To coordinate the effort, Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff, was appointed Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE), with direct access to the Prime Minister. An Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) was established at RAF Harwell, south of Oxford, under the directorship of Cockcroft. AERE moved to Aldermaston in 1952. Christopher Hinton agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new atomic weapons facilities. These included a new uranium plant at Springfields in Lancashire, and nuclear reactors and plutonium processing facilities at Windscale in Cumbria. Hinton established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire on 4 February 1946.

In July 1946, the Chiefs of Staff Committee recommended that Britain acquire nuclear weapons. They estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of production facilities that had already been approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Portal submitted a proposal to do so at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, a subcommittee of the Gen 75 Committee, which agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. It also endorsed his proposal to place Penney, now the Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR) at Fort Halstead in Kent, in charge of the bomb development effort, which was codenamed High Explosive Research. Penney contended that &quot;the discriminative test for a first-class power is whether it has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to pass the test or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally.&quot;

Although the British government had committed to the development of an independent nuclear deterrent, it still hoped for a restoration of the nuclear Special Relationship with the Americans. It was therefore important that nothing be done that would jeopardise this.

==Site selection==
Implicit in the decision to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. Lacking open, thinly-populated areas, British officials considered locations overseas. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. A request to use it was sent to the American Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1949. In October 1950 the Americans turned down the request. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. Penney spoke to Omond Solandt, the chairman of the Canadian Defence Research Board, and they arranged for a joint feasibility study.

The study noted several requirements for a test area:

* an isolated area with no human habitation downwind;
* large enough to accommodate a dozen detonations over a period of several years;
* with prevailing winds that would blow fallout out to sea but away from shipping lanes;
* a temporary camp site at least upwind of the detonation area;
* a base camp site at least upwind of the detonation area, with room for laboratories, workshops and signals equipment;
* ready for use by mid-1952.
The first test would probably be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.

In September 1950, the Admiralty suggested that the uninhabited Montebello Islands in Australia might be suitable, so Attlee obtained permission from the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, to send a survey party to look at the islands, which are about and from Onslow. Major General James Cassels, the Chief Liaison Officer with the United Kingdom Services Liaison Staff (UKSLS) in Melbourne, was designated the principal British contact in Australia, and Menzies nominated Sir Frederick Shedden, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, as the person with whom Cassels should deal.

At the time Britain was still Australia&#x27;s largest trading partner; it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. Britain and Australia had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting communist forces together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.

Australia was particularly interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity as part of the post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, but the 1948 &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot; cut Australian scientists off from information they had formerly had access to. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or the &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot;. Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States, and the Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia. The creation of NATO in 1949 excluded Australia from the Western Alliance.

The three-man survey party, headed by Air Vice Marshal E. D. Davis, arrived in Sydney on 1 November 1950, and embarked on , under the command of Commander A. H. Cooper, who carried out a detailed hydrographic survey of the islands. The charts at the Admiralty had been made by in August 1840. Soundings were taken of the depths of coastal waters to measure the tides, and samples of the gravel and sand were taken to assess whether they could be used for making concrete. The work afloat and ashore was complemented by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aerial photography of the islands. The British survey team returned to London on 29 November 1950. The islands were assessed as suitable for atomic testing, but, for climatic reasons, only in October.

On 27 March 1951, Attlee sent Menzies a personal message saying that, while negotiations with the United States for use of the Nevada Test Site were ongoing, work would need to begin if the Montebello Islands were to be used in October 1952. Menzies replied that he could not authorise the test until after the Australian federal election, to be held on 28 April 1951, but was willing to allow work to continue. Menzies was re-elected, and the Australian government formally agreed in May 1951. On 28 May, Attlee sent a comprehensive list of assistance that it hoped that Australia would provide. A more detailed survey was requested, which was carried out by in July and August 1951. The British government emphasised the importance of security, so as not to imperil its negotiations with the United States. The Australian government gave all weapon design data a classification of &quot;Top Secret&quot;, other aspects of the test being &quot;Classified&quot;. Nuclear weapons design was already covered by a D notice in the United Kingdom. Australian D Notice No. 8 was issued to cover nuclear tests.

Meanwhile, negotiations continued with the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 for use of the Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, and the chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by Robert A. Lovett, the American Deputy Secretary of Defense and Robert LeBaron, the Deputy Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, British participation being limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.

The Nevada Test Site would be cheaper than Montebello, although the cost would be paid in scarce dollars. Information gathered would have to be shared with the Americans, who would not share their own data. It would not be possible to test from a ship, and the political advantages in demonstrating that Britain could develop and test nuclear weapons without American assistance would be foregone. The Americans were under no obligation to make the test site available for subsequent tests. Also, as Lord Cherwell noted, an American test meant that &quot;in the lamentable event of the bomb failing to detonate, we should look very foolish indeed.&quot;

A final decision was deferred until after the UK&#x27;s 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as prime minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government&#x27;s decision to use Montebello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year. When queried by a UK Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.

==Preparations==
To coordinate the test, codenamed &quot;Operation Hurricane&quot;, the British government established a Hurricane Executive Committee chaired by the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Edward Evans-Lombe. It held its first meeting in May 1951. To deal with it, an Australian Hurricane Panel was created, chaired by the Australian Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, Captain Alan McNicoll. Its other members were Colonel John Wilton from the Australian Army, Group Captain Alister Murdoch from the RAAF and Charles Spry from Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Cassels or his representative was invited to attend its meetings. A pressing question was that of observers. Churchill decided to exclude the media and members of the UK parliament. As Canada was a party to the 1948 &quot;Modus Vivendi&quot;, Canadian scientists and technicians would have access to all technical data, but Australians would not.

Penney was anxious to secure the services of Titterton, who had recently emigrated to Australia, as he had worked on the American Trinity and Crossroads tests. Menzies asked the vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Sir Douglas Copland, to release Titterton to work on Operation Hurricane. Cockcroft also wanted assistance from Leslie Martin, the Department of Defence&#x27;s Science Advisor, who was also a professor of physics at the University of Melbourne, to work in the health physics area. The two men knew each other from their time at Cambridge University before the war. After some argument, Martin was accepted as an official observer, as was W. A. S. Butement, the Chief Scientist at the Department of Supply. The only other official observer was Solandt from Canada.

An advance party of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron from RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, moved to Onslow in August 1951 with heavy construction equipment, taking the train to Geraldton and then the road to Onslow. This was then transported to the Montebello Islands. A prefabricated hut was taken across by &quot;Karangai&quot;, along with equipment for establishing a meteorological station. Other materiel was moved from Onslow to the islands in lots in an ALC-40 landing craft manned by the Australian Army and towed by &quot;Karangai&quot;. This included two bulldozers, a grader, tip trucks, portable generators, water tanks and a mobile radio transceiver. The hut was erected, and the meteorological station henceforth manned by an RAAF officer and four assistants. Roads and landings were constructed, and camp sites established.

The next stage of work began in February 1952, in the wake of the December decision to proceed with the test. A detachment of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron was flown to Onslow from RAAF Bankstown in two RAAF Dakota aircraft, and were then taken to the islands by the &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvette . &quot;Karangai&quot; fetched of Marston Mat from Darwin that was used for road works and hardstands. The SS &quot;Dorrigo&quot; brought in another three weeks later. A water supply was also developed. To bring water from the Fortescue River, a quantity of Victaulic-coupling pipe was brought from the Department of Works in Sydney and the Woomera Rocket Range in South Australia. Because the pipe was laid around obstacles, this proved to be insufficient. No more pipe was in storage, so a firm in Melbourne was asked to make some. An order was placed on a Friday evening, and the pipe was shipped the following Thursday morning, making its way to the Fortescue River by road and rail. The system delivered up to per hour to a jetty on the Fortescue estuary, from which it was taken to the islands by the 120ft Motor Lighter &quot;MWL 251&quot;.

The British assembled a small fleet for Operation Hurricane that included the escort carrier , which served as the flagship, and the LSTs &quot;Narvik&quot;, &quot;Zeebrugge&quot; and &quot;Tracker&quot;, under the command of Rear Admiral A. D. Torlesse. Leonard Tyte from the AERE was appointed the technical director. &quot;Campania&quot; had five aircraft embarked, three Westland WS-51 Dragonfly helicopters and two Supermarine Sea Otter amphibians. Between them, the LSTs carried five LCMs and twelve LCAs. The bomb, less its radioactive components, was assembled at Foulness, and then taken to the River-class frigate on 5 June 1952 for transport to Australia. It took &quot;Campania&quot; and &quot;Plym&quot; eight weeks to make the voyage, as they sailed around the Cape of Good Hope instead of traversing the Suez Canal, because there was unrest in Egypt at the time.

The Montebello Islands were reached on 8 August. &quot;Plym&quot; was anchored in of water, off Trimouille Island. The radioactive components, the plutonium core and polonium-beryllium neutron initiator, went by air, flying from RAF Lyneham to Singapore in Handley Page Hastings aircraft via Cyprus, Sharjah and Ceylon. From Singapore they made the final leg of their journey in a Short Sunderland flying boat. The British bomb design was similar to that of the American Fat Man, but for reasons of safety and efficiency the British design incorporated a levitated pit, in which there was an air gap between the uranium tamper and the plutonium core. This gave the explosion time to build up momentum, similar in principle to a hammer hitting a nail, enabling less plutonium to be used.

The British fleet was joined by eleven RAN ships, including the aircraft carrier with 805 and 817 Squadrons embarked, and its four escorts, the destroyer , and frigates , and . The Defence (Special Undertakings) Act (1952) was passed through the Parliament of Australia between 4 and 6 June 1952, and received assent on 10 June. Under this act, the area within a radius of Flag Island was declared a prohibited area for safety and security reasons. That some of this was outside Australia&#x27;s territorial waters attracted comment. The frigate was tasked with patrolling the prohibited area, while its sister ship acted as a weather ship. Logistical support was provided by , and &quot;Mildura&quot;, the motor water lighter &quot;MWL 251&quot; and the motor refrigeration lighter &quot;MRL 252&quot;, and the tugboat , which towed a fuel barge. Dakotas of No. 86 Wing RAAF provided air patrols and a weekly courier run.

==Operation==
The main site, known as H1, was established on the south-east corner of Hermite Island. This was the location of the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also the location of the generators that provided electric power and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty fuel containers for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, between Brandy Bay and Buttercup Island, whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.

The original intention was that the scientists would stay on &quot;Campania&quot;, commuting to the islands each day, but the survey party had misjudged the tides; &quot;Campania&quot; could not enter the lagoon, and had to anchor in the Parting Pool. The pinnaces could not tie up alongside &quot;Campania&quot; at night, and had to be moored several miles away. Transferring to the boats in choppy waters was hazardous. One scientist fell in the sea and was rescued by Commander Douglas Bromley, &quot;Campania&quot;″s executive officer. Rough seas prevented much work being done between 10 and 14 August. It took about an hour and a half to get from &quot;Campania&quot; to H2, and travelling between &quot;Plym&quot; and &quot;Campania&quot; took between two and three hours. Even when a boat was on call it could take 45 minutes to respond. Boat availability soon became a problem with only five LCMs, leaving personnel waiting for one to arrive. The twelve smaller LCAs were also employed; although they could operate when the tides made waters too shallow for the pinnaces, their wooden bottoms were easily holed by coral outcrops. On 15 August, some men were transferred from &quot;Campania&quot; by one of its three Dragonfly helicopters, but the weather closed in and they could not be picked up again, having to find shelter on &quot;Tracker&quot; and &quot;Zeebrugge&quot;, which were moored in the lagoon. To get around these problems, tented camps were established for the scientists at H1 on Hermite Island and Cocoa Beach (also known as T2) on Trimouille Island.

Scientific rehearsals were held on 12 and 13 September. This was followed by an operational rehearsal on 19 September, which included fully assembling the bomb, since the radioactive components had arrived the day before on a Sunderland. Penney arrived by air on 22 September. Everything was ready by 30 September, and the only remaining factor was the weather. This was unfavourable on 1 October but improved the following day, when Penney designated 3 October as the date for the test. The final countdown commenced at 07:45 local time on 3 October 1952. &quot;Plym&quot; was moored a few hundred metres west of T2 (approximately ). The bomb was successfully detonated at 7:59:24am on 3 October 1952 local time, which was 11:59:24pm on 2 October 1952 UTC, 0:59:24am on 3 October in London, and 7:59:24am on 3 October in Perth. The explosion occurred below the water line, and left a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed deep and across. The yield was estimated at . All that was left of &quot;Plym&quot; was a &quot;gluey black substance&quot; that washed up on the shore of Trimouille Island. Derek Hickman, a Royal Engineer observing the blast aboard &quot;Zeebrugge&quot;, later said of &quot;Plym&quot;, &quot;all that was left of her were a few fist-sized pieces of metal that fell like rain, and the shape of the frigate scorched on the sea bed.&quot; The bomb had performed exactly as expected.

Two Dragonfly helicopters flew in to gather a sample of contaminated seawater from the lagoon. Scientists in gas masks and protective gear visited points in pinnaces to collect samples and retrieve recordings. &quot;Tracker&quot; controlled this aspect, as it had the decontamination facilities. Air samples were collected by RAAF Avro Lincoln aircraft. Although the feared tidal surge had not occurred, radioactive contamination of the islands was widespread and severe. It was clear that had an atomic bomb exploded in a British port, it would have been a catastrophe worse than the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The fallout cloud rose to and was blown out to sea, as intended; but later reversed direction and blew over the Australian mainland. Very low levels of radioactivity were detected as far away as Brisbane.

Penney and some of his staff returned by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 for his role in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view of the degree of radioactive contamination, he felt he could not leave his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of &quot;Narvik&quot; in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Montebello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on &quot;Campania&quot;, which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. &quot;Hawkesbury&quot; continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.

==Outcome==
Two more nuclear tests were conducted in the Montebello Islands as part of Operation Mosaic in 1956, the detonations taking place on Alpha and Trimouille Islands. By the 1980s the radioactivity had decayed to the point where it was no longer hazardous to the casual visitor, but there were still radioactive metal fragments containing cobalt-60, the remains of &quot;Plym&quot;. The island remained a prohibited area until 1992. A 2006 zoological survey found that the wildlife had recovered, and that the &quot;Aprasia rostrata&quot;, the legless lizard discovered by Hill, was not extinct. As part of the Gorgon gas project, rats and feral cats were eradicated from the Montebello Islands in 2009, and birds and marsupials were transplanted from nearby Barrow Island to Hermite Island. Today, the Montebello Islands are a park. Visitors are advised not to spend more than an hour per day at the test sites, nor to take relics of the tests as souvenirs. A pyramid-shaped obelisk marks the site of the explosion on Alpha Island.

In 1992, Australian scientists Keith Wise and John Moroney of the Australian Radiation Laboratory estimated that the collective dose to the Australian population due to the test was , statistically enough to have caused one death from cancer. Of the 1,518 personnel involved who were issued with film badges, 1,263 recorded no measurable amount of radiation, and 14 recorded over the course of the whole operation. None recorded more than . Dosimeters and film badges were not issued to the crews of the RAAF Lincolns who gathered radioactive samples, but later experience showed that exposure would not have been medically significant. Studies of British veterans of all nuclear tests in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 2003 did not find conclusive evidence of increased mortality or health effects. A 2006 study of nearly 11,000 Australian participants of the British nuclear testing program showed that participants had an 18% increased mortality from cancers and a 23% increase in overall cancer incidence, but the increase in cancer mortality and incidence could not be linked to the radiation exposure from nuclear testing, but rather to solar radiation.

With the success of Operation Hurricane, Britain became the third nuclear power after the United States and the Soviet Union. The first production bombs, of the Blue Danube design, based on the Hurricane device, were delivered to the RAF in November 1953 and, two years later, the RAF had bombers capable of carrying them. In the interim, the UK relied on the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) for its nuclear deterrent. SAC began deploying nuclear-capable bombers to the UK in April 1949. Four weeks after Operation Hurricane, the United States successfully demonstrated a hydrogen bomb. The technology mastered in Operation Hurricane was six years old, and with the hydrogen bomb in hand, the US Congress saw no benefit in renewing cooperation. All the while Britain strove for independence, at the same time it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. As successful as it was, Operation Hurricane fell short on both counts.

<text>In the 1950s, LeTourneau Inc. developed several overland trains, essentially oversized semi-trailer trucks that could travel over almost any terrain. Their intention was to be able to handle logistics needs without being dependent on local road or rail systems, allowing them to operate in back-country areas. The US Army had three experimental units built, the largest reaching almost long, which holds the record for the longest off-road vehicle. Road trains are in use in certain roles today, but the US Army examples and a few derivatives appear to be the only off-road examples built.

==History==

===LeTourneau===
In the early 1950s, LeTourneau, Inc., a heavy-equipment maker based in Longview, Texas, developed the idea of using a diesel-electric transmission to drive multi-wheeled vehicles. Each wheel was driven by a separate electric motor, which gave the vehicles much better traction as the force of the engine was spread across a number of wheels. In general terms these vehicles were similar to the diesel-electric locomotives that were being widely introduced by the railways at the same time, but they replaced the steel wheels with rubber ones. The earliest vehicles using the system were a number of 6x6 graders, wheel tractor-scrapers and other earthmovers.

In 1953, R. G. LeTourneau sold the earthmoving portions of the business to Westinghouse, a sale that included a five-year moratorium before LeTourneau could sell into the market again. While the moratorium ran out, LeTourneau developed a number of new vehicles based on the same drivetrain. These included a number of special-purpose military designs like launchers for the Corporal missile, engineering vehicles that could quickly haul crashed bombers off runways, and even an enormous vehicle intended to pick up beached landing craft.

===VC-12 Tournatrain ===

The overland train concept first developed as a way to haul trees out of the bush, without the need to prepare a road capable of supporting a traditional truck. A truck would need to have a surface flat and strong enough for its driven wheels, normally four at the rear of the cab, to gain traction needed to climb any grades. With multiple driven wheels, LeTourneau&#x27;s 6x6 diesel-electrics were an obvious solution, but a single vehicle was too small to justify their purchase costs. The solution was to turn the 6x6 into an extendable design, using flexible connections to allow any number of driven wheels to be added, as needed.

The first of these designs was the VC-12 Tournatrain, which consisted of a power truck with a 500-hp Cummins VT-12 engine, and three 20-ton trailers. Each wheel was powered by a separate electric motor, four to each vehicle, including the locomotive. First tested in February 1953, after several months of testing, an additional four trailers were added, with the last holding a second engine. The new version was completed in February 1954, and supported a maximum payload of 140 tons.

===VC-22 Sno-Freighter, the DEW line===

During this period the U.S. and Canada were in the process of developing the DEW Line, which was located in areas with no roads, few airbases, and in areas where the sea ice often prevented ships from accessing the sites. On 15 April 1954 the company demonstrated VC-12 to the US Army Transportation Research and Development Command, or TRADCOM, proposing that the system would be useful for logistics operations in the arctic if equipped with more wheels.

TRADCOM offered funding to create the TC-264 Sno-Buggy, which had eight huge rubber tires, arranged in pairs and driven by four motors powered by a single Allison V-1710 engine running on butane. The resulting vehicle has an enormous amount of tire area to vehicle weight, allowing it to float on the tundra and snow. First unveiled in June 1954, the Sno-Buggy was sent to Greenland for testing.

Alaska Freight Lines of Seattle had contracted with Western Electric to provide 500 tons of equipment to the DEW stations being built in the Alaska sector. Hearing of the VC-12, on 5 January 1955 they signed a contract with LeTourneau for the construction of the VC-22 Sno-Freighter. The contract called for a single locomotive and six cars able to haul 150 tons, cross rivers up to deep, cut through snow drifts and operate at temperatures as low as . The locomotive provided AC power from 400-hp Cummins NVH-12 engines, powering its own four wheels and the five four-wheeled trailers, forming a train.

Since the VC-22 was based almost entirely on existing parts from their 6x6 vehicles, even the tires, the company was able to deliver it with surprising speed. It was completed on 17 February 1955, painted, and then sent to Alaska on the 21st. The vehicle served well throughout 1955, but in the second season of use a fire consumed the locomotive&#x27;s power generation section and the remains were pulled out of Canada. When Alaska Freight Lines&#x27;s contract with Western Electric ran out it was soon left to rot. Today it sits abandoned outside Fairbanks, Alaska near the Steese Highway.

On their own initiative, LeTourneau took the basic VC-22, changed the engine to the 600-hp VT-12, and changed the trailers to side-dumping bins to produce a Side-Dump Train. The six-wheeled locomotive also had its own bin, and could operate independently. Completed in October 1955, the company was still under the moratorium period and could not sell it for earthmoving, and the train saw no orders.

===LCC-1 Sno-Train ===

Impressed with the results of the Sno-Buggy, in late 1954 the Army Transportation Corps asked LeTourneau to combine the features of the Tournatrain and Sno-Buggy into a new vehicle. LeTourneau called the result the YS-1 Army Sno-Train but the Army knew it as the Logistics Cargo Carrier, or LCC-1. The LCC-1 combined the wheels of the Sno-Buggy with the power system of the Tournatrain to produce a 16x16 vehicle with one locomotive and three cars capable of handling a load of 45 tons in total. The control cab was itself articulated into two compartments; a heated driving compartment in front for the crew of three, and a rear section containing the 600-hp diesel engine, generators and fuel tanks. The cab also sported a powered crane on the rear.

In spite of starting the project before the VC-22, the LCC-1 required much more customization, and was not completed until January 1956. After testing at the factory, it was handed over to the Army in March, and continued testing in snow at the TRADCOM proving grounds in Houghton, Michigan. After acceptance, it was sent to Greenland, and then traveled around the north for some time, making its last cargo run in 1962. The LCC-1 eventually ended up abandoned in a salvage yard right behind Fort Wainwright, Fairbanks, Alaska. Despite the years of neglect, the LCC-1 still has its 10 foot tall wheels as well as its generators. In addition to the LCC-1&#x27;s primary drive unit, there are also ten of its original trailers in the Fort Wainwright yard, which is not far from the site where the VC-22 sits abandoned.
Today, the LCC-1 now has a permanent site at the Yukon Transportation Museum in Whitehorse, Yukon. One trailer also resides at the front of the Mukluk Land theme park near Tok, Alaska.

===TC-497 Overland Train, Mk II===

LCC-1 was so successful that in 1958 the Army contracted for a larger version, the TC-497 Overland Train Mark II. Generally similar to the LCC-1 in concept, the Mark II included a number of features to allow the train to grow to any length.

One change was the removal of the Cummins engines and their replacement with gas turbine engines of higher power and lower weight. Whereas the LCC-1 had a single 600-hp engine, the Overland Train had four 1,170-hp Saturn 10MC engines from Solar Turbines, one in the &quot;control car&quot; and three others spread through the train. New power trailers could be added at any point along the train. To further reduce weight, most of the vehicle was built from welded aluminum.

Taking corners was a serious problem. If the train made a sharp turn, each trailer after the first would cut inside the previous trailers path, and each trailer would make a larger diameter turn than the previous, and with the length, it was difficult for the driver to estimate how much space would be needed - if it was available. B-trains have a similar but slightly reduced problem and as a result may be restricted from some roads. To avoid an obstacle, an excessively wide turn would be needed. To solve this problem, the trailers had steerable wheels that would each turn when they reached the same point on the ground, eliminating the cut in and allowing the train to make much sharper turns.

The Mark II had a much larger six-wheeled cab that was over tall and was no longer articulated due to the ability for all the wheels to be steered. The turbine engine was much smaller than the diesel it replaced, allowing the interior to support a crew of six with sleeping quarters, toilets and a galley. It was even equipped with a radar. An additional two power cars and ten cargo cars were built for testing. In total the train now stretched over . On flat ground it could carry 150 tons of cargo at about 20 mph. Range at full load was normally , but additional fuel trailers could be added to extend it.

Final specifications were completed in 1960, and construction took most of 1961. After preliminary testing, it was handed to the Army in February 1962, and shipped to the Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona. In testing under the &quot;Project OTTER&quot;, for &quot;Overland Train Terrain Evaluation Research&quot;, the vehicle performed well. But in the end the Army gave up on the idea as newer heavy-lift helicopters like the S-64 Skycrane made the train concept outdated.

The vehicle remained unused for a time, and was then put up for sale for $1.4 million in 1969. All that remains of the Mark II is the control cab which remains at Yuma Proving Ground Heritage Center, the rest was sold off to a local scrap dealer. The Mark II retains the record for the longest offroad vehicle in the world.

<text>The first USS &quot;Thomas&quot; (DD–182) was a of the United States Navy that entered service just after World War I.

She was transferred to the Royal Navy becoming the , HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; (I15) and was used for convoy escort work.

In April 1941 &quot;St Albans&quot; was transferred to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy retaining her name as HNoMS &quot;St Albans&quot;

In mid-1944, &quot;St Albans&quot; was transferred to the Soviet Navy as Dostoyny.

==Service history==

===As USS &quot;Thomas&quot;===
Named after Clarence Crase Thomas, she was laid down on 23 March 1918 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company; Virginia. It was launched on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Evelyn M. Thomas, widow of the namesake; and commissioned on 25 April 1919.

&quot;Thomas&quot; operated off the east coast on training cruises and exercises until decommissioned at Philadelphia on 30 June 1922. In the Navy-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920 she was as classified as DD-182. After leaving service she lay in reserve in the Philadelphia Navy Yard&#x27;s back channel for the next 18 years.

Recommissioned on 17 June 1940 – as the United States Navy expanded to meet the demands imposed by Neutrality Patrols off American coastlines – &quot;Thomas&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Division 79 of the Atlantic Squadron and operated briefly in training and exercises off the eastern seaboard.

The &quot;destroyer-for-bases&quot; agreement was made between the UK and the US at the start of September 1940 - under it 50 WWI-era destroyers were transferred to the British in exchange for eases on strategic base sites in the western hemisphere.

She arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 18 September 1940 and officially turned over to the Royal Navy on 23 September 1940. Her name was subsequently struck from the United States Navy list on 8 January 1941.

===As HMS &quot;St Albans&quot;===
Simultaneously renamed HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; (I15) and commissioned the same day for service in the Royal Navy, the destroyer sailed for the British Isles on 29 September. After calling at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, en route, she arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 9 October.

&quot;St Albans&quot; and three sister ships – HMS &quot;St Mary&#x27;s&quot;, HMS &quot;Bath&quot;, and HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot; – were attached to the 1st Minelaying Squadron as permanent escort force. Operating off the west coast of Scotland, the destroyers participated in some of the earliest minelaying operations in the Denmark Strait which separates Iceland from Greenland.

Between these escort missions, &quot;St Albans&quot; escorted convoys. On 17 and 18 January 1941, the destroyer searched for survivors from , torpedoed by on 17 January. &quot;St Albans&quot; underwent repairs at Chatham in February to prepare for her transfer to the Royal Norwegian Navy-in-exile on 14 April.

===As HNoMS &quot;St Albans&quot;===
&quot;St Albans&quot; had no sooner entered service with the Norwegians than she collided with the minesweeping trawler HMS &quot;Alberic&quot;, sinking the trawler and sustaining enough damage herself to necessitate repairs in the dockyard.

When again ready for action, HNoMS &quot;St Albans&quot; joined the 7th Escort Group, operating out of Liverpool. On 12 June, she picked up the survivors from the sunken steamship – torpedoed that day by the – and brought them safely to Liverpool.

On 3 August 1941, while bound from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom in the screen of convoy SL 81, &quot;St Albans&quot; joined the destroyer and the in sinking . During subsequent operations screening convoys in shipping lanes between West Africa and the British Isles, &quot;St Albans&quot; made a score of attacks on U-boats but did not achieve another kill.

During the following autumn, a heavy gale severely damaged &quot;St Albans&quot; while she was escorting convoy ON 22 on 8 October. Despite the high seas and strong winds, &quot;St Albans&quot;″s Norwegian reached Reykjavík, Iceland safely. The destroyer&#x27;s seaworthiness and the seamanship exhibited by her Norwegian crew elicited a warm commendatory signal from the Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches (C-in-C WA). In this message of 12 October 1941, he also praised the destroyer&#x27;s exemplary steaming performance during the previous three months.

&quot;St Albans&quot;, meanwhile, continued her escort duties with the 7th Escort Group into 1942. In March, she escorted the damaged aircraft carrier from Liverpool to the Clyde and, in the following month, helped to screen convoy PQ 15 as it carried materiel to northern Russia. During the operation, heavy German air and submarine attacks sank three Allied ships.

Due to an error in identification &quot;St Albans&quot; and the minesweeper sank the Polish submarine on 2 May. Five crewmen were killed. The court of Enquiry found that &quot;Jastrząb&quot; was 100 miles out of position, in an area where U-boats were expected to operate, and no blame could be attached to either commander. However this conclusion is disputed by other sources.

Later that month, &quot;St Albans&quot; joined the Liverpool Special Escort Division. Among the vessels escorted early in June was the Cunard-White Star liner , operating as troopship travelling to the Middle East via the Cape of Good Hope After refitting at Falmouth between July and October 1942, &quot;St Albans&quot; again operated with the Special Escort Division until the end of 1942. In January 1943, she served as a target vessel for training RAF Coastal Command aircraft.

Late in February, she got underway and steamed into the North Sea toward the Scandinavian coast to search for a Norwegian merchantman which was reportedly attempting to escape to sea from German-controlled waters. During this mission, the destroyer was attacked by German aircraft but emerged unharmed.

Shifted to the Western Local Escort Force soon thereafter, &quot;St Albans&quot; was based at Halifax and operated in convoy escort missions in the western Atlantic for the remainder of 1943. Departing Halifax four days after Christmas 1943, &quot;St Albans&quot; arrived in the Tyne on 10 January 1944, where she was soon laid up in reserve. &quot;St Albans&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy on 4 February 1944

===As &quot;Dostoyny&quot;===

On 16 July 1944, the British transferred &quot;St Albans&quot; to the Soviet Navy, who renamed her &quot;Dostoyny&quot; (rus. Достойный, &quot;Worthy&quot;). She was returned to the British on 28 February 1949 at Rosyth, Scotland. It was eventually broken up for scrap at Charlestown in April 1949.

For service in World War II, &quot;St Albans&quot; was awarded the battle honours &quot;Atlantic 1941-43&quot;, &quot;English Channel 1942&quot;, &quot;Arctic 1942&quot; and &quot; North Sea 1943&quot;

<text>Harald Wapenaar (born 10 April 1970) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. As well as playing in his native Netherlands, he also played league football in Italy and England.

==Career==
Wapenaar played for Italian club Udinese and FC Utrecht before transferring to Portsmouth in the summer of 2003. Portsmouth signed Wapenaar as competition for first-choice goalkeeper Shaka Hislop. However, Hislop&#x27;s superb form and the emergence of young goalkeeper Jamie Ashdown meant Wapenaar struggled for games prior to his move back to the Netherlands, to Vitesse Arnhem in January 2005. After losing his place in 2006–07, he signed for Sparta Rotterdam on loan in 2007, starting in their Eredivisie match against Excelsior Rotterdam on 21 January .

Between 2010 and 2015, Wapenaar worked as goalkeepers coach for FC Volendam. He held the same position during the 2015–16 season at Lierse. He was appointed goalkeepers coach at Willem II in July 2016. On 6 January 2022, Wapenaar left the Tilburg club with immediate effect because of &#x27;insurmountable difference of opinion about vision and working method&#x27;.

<text>A voting bloc is a group of voters that are strongly motivated by a specific common concern or group of concerns to the point that such specific concerns tend to dominate their voting patterns, causing them to vote together in elections.

Beliefnet identifies 12 main religious blocs in American politics, such as the &quot;Religious Right&quot;, whose concerns are dominated by religious and sociocultural issues; and American Jews, who are identified as a &quot;strong Democratic group&quot; with liberal views on economics and social issues. The result is that each of these groups votes &quot;en bloc&quot; in elections. Bloc voting in the United States is particularly cohesive among Orthodox Jews.

Voting blocs can be defined by a host of other shared characteristics, including region, age, gender, education level, and even music choice.

<doc id="1125762" wikidata="Q533614" url="?curid=1125762" title="Pyrography">
<text>Pyrography or pyrogravure is the free handed art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker. It is also known as pokerwork or wood burning.

The term means &quot;writing with fire&quot;, from the Greek (fire) and (writing). It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying lens. &quot;Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork.&quot;

Pyrography is also popular among gourd crafters and artists, where designs are burned onto the exterior of a dried hard-shell gourd.

== History == 

Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesizes that the art form dates back to prehistory when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires. It was known in China from the time of the Han dynasty, where it was known as &quot;Fire Needle Embroidery&quot;. During the Victorian era, the invention of pyrography machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term &quot;pyrography&quot; was coined (previously the name &quot;pokerwork&quot; had been most widely used) In the late 19th century, a Melbourne architect by the name of Alfred Smart discovered that water-based paint could be applied hot to wood by pumping benzoline fumes through a heated hollow platinum pencil. This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and shading that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and Art Nouveau pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. Pyrography is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Flanders, as well as Argentina and other areas in South America.

==Equipment==
Traditional pyrography can be performed using any heated metal implement. Modern pyrography machines exist, and can be divided into three main categories.

A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured.

===Solid-point burners===
Solid-point burners are similar in design to a soldering iron. They have a solid brass tip which is heated by an electrical element, and operate at a fixed temperature.

===Wire-nib burners===
Wire-nib burners have variable temperature controls. The writing nib is heated by an electric current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable nibs to allow for different effects.

===Laser cutters===
Laser cutters can be set to scorch the material instead of cutting all the way through it. Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood. Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform pyrography on thin card or even paper.

=== Woods ===
Woods differ in hardness, grain, figure, texture, color, and other physical characteristics.

Hardness: All woods can be classified into hard or soft. Usually softwoods are from coniferous (needle-leaved) trees.

Hardwoods are from broad-leaved trees. These hardwood trees can be classified into two distinct growing seasons each year (hot and cold season or a wet and dry season) such as:
* Earlywood: normally lighter in color and weight and only moderately strong
* Latewood: usually heavier, darker, and much stronger.

Softwood will burn faster than a hardwood does. It does not require very hot temperature to burn as do the hardwoods.

Light-coloured hardwoods such as sycamore, basswood, beech and birch are most commonly used, as their fine grain is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, pine or oak, are also used.

Grain: Grain is the direction of the fibrous elements of the wood cells. This is important to sand with the grain. Also the grain can cause deviation from its intended path with use of woodturning pen unless the artist applies more pressure and burns slower on the grain.

Figure: This is the natural design, or pattern, that can be seen on the cut surface of the wood. The figure present on the wood should always be taken into consideration when the artist is planning their woodburned design.

Texture: There is a texture on the surface of that wood that feels either coarse or fine, even or uneven.

Woodburners typically avoid using very fine or intricate designs on uneven, coarse-textured wood. Softwoods are more apt to be fine or moderately coarse-textured.

Color: Woodburning is mainly used to enhance the natural beauty of a wooden project, so woodburners take precious care not to obfuscate a beautiful figure, grain, luster, or color by over-charring.

== Leather ==

Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. Leather lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern tanning methods leave chemicals in the leather which are toxic when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.

== Safety ==
Extremely fine wood dust is liberated when sanding wood. All wood dust is hazardous, can cause respiratory problems. For this reason, many woodburners wear quality dust masks/respirators while power carving, and use a good dust collection system to prevent indoor air pollution.

There are serious risks associated with burning pressure-treated wood. It is treated with chemicals that, although safely bound in the wood fibers for construction purposes, are inherently dangerous to woodworkers and woodburners when liberated through sanding or vaporized by heat. Similar dangers are inherent to stained, painted or sealed wood. A well ventilated room with a running fan will encourage air circulation and displace lingering smoke.

Fractal burning is a specific pyrography technique that is extremely dangerous and has resulted in many documented deaths.

<text>Carlos Alberto Pavón Plummer (born 9 October 1973) is a Honduran former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is regarded as one of the best Honduran footballers in history, and by most as the nation&#x27;s greatest player ever.

Most prominently affiliated with Real España, he has made over 200 appearances for &quot;Los Aurinegros&quot; in the Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Honduras, and is Honduras&#x27; all-time leading national team goalscorer.

==Club career==
Born in El Progreso, Yoro, to Blanca Nieves Pavón Macedo and Costa Rican footballer Allard Plummer, Pavón began his career at the age of 18 in his native Honduras with Real España on 30 May 1992 against Platense in the 1992 Honduran Cup, the final score was 1-1. While with Real España, Pavón won four Honduran league championships, as well as leading the league in scoring.

===Mexican years===
Pavón then played in Mexico for seven successive years, except for a short stint in Spain. He played for Morelia in the Mexican Primera División, winning the 2000 Clausura with the club. He has also played for Toluca, San Luis, Correcaminos, Necaxa, Cruz Azul, and Celaya, where he led the Mexican Second Division in scoring.

===Europe===
He has played in Italy in Serie A for both Udinese and Napoli from 2001 to 2003 and in Spain&#x27;s first division with Real Valladolid (1995).

===Major League Soccer===
On 19 June 2007, he signed a deal to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy. 
He scored twice in the away match against New York Red Bulls on 18 August 2007, both coming from David Beckham assists. The match attracted 66,000 fans, the highest attendance ever recorded for a Bulls game. Pavón was waived at the end of the season.

Despite other offers from MLS teams, he went back to Real Club España in Honduras for 2008. After being released, he signed on with the struggling Club Necaxa of the Primera División de México. He made his debut for Necaxa on 1 March 2009 after only one training session with the club. He started the match and assisted both goals in their 2–2 draw with Club Santos Laguna.

After trying his luck at Club Necaxa he returned to Real España and retired after the 2012 Clausura to become assistant coach at the club as well as a football commentator.

<text>Andrew Griffin (born 17 March 1979) is an English former footballer.

Griffin began his career at Stoke City, where he established a reputation as a solid wing-back defender. His impressive performances for the &quot;Potters&quot; led to him being signed by Newcastle United for a fee of £1.5million in January 1998. He spent six years on Tyneside before moving south to Portsmouth in 2004. He was unable to establish himself as first choice right back at &quot;Pompey&quot; and re-joined his old club Stoke on loan for the 2006–07 season.

Stoke narrowly missed out on a play-off position and so Griffin decided to sign for newly promoted Derby County, however with Derby struggling to compete in the Premier League he joined Stoke for a third time in January 2008. He helped Stoke to claim promotion and was made captain of the side for the 2008–09 season. Griffin lost his place in the side after an on the pitch altercation with Ricardo Fuller at West Ham United in December 2008. He joined Reading in 2010 helping them gain promotion at the second attempt after failing in the play-offs. He was released by Reading in May 2012 and joined Doncaster Rovers in October 2012. He spent two years at Doncaster before ending his career with a short spell at Chester

==Club career==

===Stoke City===
Griffin was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester and began his career with Stoke City. He impressed in the clubs youth ranks and he was handed a professional contract in July 1996. He instantly became a regular in the side during the 1996–97 season playing in 36 matches including the final match at the Victoria Ground and in just his first season as a professional he won the clubs player of the year award. In 1997 Stoke moved to the Britannia Stadium but the team struggled all season and with relegation looming Stoke decided to cash in on their most promising prospect selling Griffin to Newcastle United for £1.5million in January 1998.

===Newcastle United===
Griffin settled quickly in Newcastle and earned call-ups to the England U21 team and also played in the 1999 FA Cup Final. However, he picked up an injury in August 1999 ruling him out for the 1999–2000 season but made a comeback the following season but he again suffered a hernia injury missing another season. Griffin enjoyed something of a resurgence under Bobby Robson and made several solid performances during the 2002–03 season, including in the UEFA Champions League, when his winning goal against Juventus rekindled his side&#x27;s campaign. Injuries and a failure to get a regular place in the side saw him not offered a new contract by Newcastle at the end of the 2003–04 season.

===Portsmouth===
Griffin joined Portsmouth in May 2004 on a free transfer. After agreeing to join the Fratton Park club Griffin revealed that he took the advice of former Newcastle teammate Lomana LuaLua. His Pompey career got off to a bad start as he conceded an own goal on his debut in a 2–0 home defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. He played 27 games in 2004–05 and 21 games in 2005–06.

====Stoke City loan====
By the summer of 2006 he dropped out of Harry Redknapp&#x27;s plans and in September of that year he was loaned to former club Stoke City. He became first choice right back under Tony Pulis as was a number of loan signings for Stoke in the 2006–07 season which helped turn around the club&#x27;s fortunes. He scored two goals for Stoke, firstly against Leeds United in a 4–0 victory, and then a &quot;sensational 30-yard strike&quot; against Coventry City. After the match Pulis spoke of his delight at Griffin&#x27;s goal and performance. &quot;It was an absolutely fantastic goal. It was top drawer. He came through the ranks at Stoke as a kid and that will mean a lot to him. It will have been lovely for him to score because he&#x27;s got family here. We&#x27;re delighted that Portsmouth have allowed us to have him on loan.&quot; He played 34 matches for Stoke in 2006–07 as Stoke narrowly missed out on a play-off place and Pulis confirmed that he would like to sign Griffin permanently.

===Derby County===

On 31 July 2007 Griffin signed for Premier League side Derby County on a three-year deal. He was initially Derby&#x27;s first choice right back, but when Tyrone Mears returned from injury and Paul Jewell replaced Billy Davies as Derby manager, he found his chances in the first team restricted. Griffin was given permission to talk to Stoke City.

===Return to Stoke City===
On 11 January 2008 Griffin moved back to Stoke City for a fee of £300,000, signing a -year contract. In January 2008, Stoke sold captain John Eustace to Watford. This move saw Griffin named Stoke&#x27;s new captain despite only being back at the club for three weeks, nonetheless Griffin was delighted describing it as a &quot;proud moment in my career.&quot; He was controversially sent-off against Queens Park Rangers on 2 March 2008 as Stoke fell to a 3–0 defeat. Stoke were successful in their appeal. In a match against Watford former teammate John Eustace was sent-off and Griffin branded the Referee&#x27;s decision as &quot;Pathetic&quot;. Griffin missed the final two matches of Stoke&#x27;s promotion winning 2007–08 campaign due to a torn hamstring. After the season ended Griffin admitted he made the wrong decision to join Derby rather than Stoke in the summer of 2007.

Griffin began the 2008–09 season as first choice right back this was until he was involved in an on pitch altercation with striker Ricardo Fuller away at West Ham United on 28 December 2008 which saw Fuller sent-off. Afterwards the pair publicly apologised for the incident. However Griffin lost his place in the side and Abdoulaye Faye took over as captain for the remainder of the season. He found himself out of the first team in 2009–10 but he did manage to score a dramatic 96th-minute winner in a 4–3 victory over Blackpool in the League Cup.

===Reading===
On 11 January 2010, he joined Reading on loan for the remainder of the season. He was instrumental in solidifying Reading&#x27;s back line in the second half of the 2009–10 season which saw Reading rise from the relegation zone at the beginning of January to 9th place by the end of the season. Griffin signed on a permanent 2-year deal on 1 July 2010 for an undisclosed fee. On 2 May 2012, after Reading had won promotion to the Premier League and with Griffin having made only 9 league appearances in the 2011–12 season, the club announced it would not be renewing Griffin&#x27;s contract.

===Doncaster Rovers===
On 22 October 2012 Griffin joined Doncaster Rovers on a non-contract basis. He played in 18 matches for Doncaster in 2012–13 as the side won promotion to the Championship. He was informed by manager Paul Dickov that he wouldn&#x27;t be getting a new contract with the club but allowed him to play with the reserves until he finds a new club.

===Chester===
Griffin joined Conference Premier side Chester on 27 March 2014. He made just four appearances for Chester before he decided to retire from playing.

==Post-retirement==
After leaving Chester in the summer of 2014 Griffin became a coach at Newcastle-under-Lyme College.

<doc id="1125767" wikidata="Q744790" url="?curid=1125767" title="Treacher Collins syndrome">
<text>Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a genetic disorder characterized by deformities of the ears, eyes, cheekbones, and chin. The degree to which a person is affected, however, may vary from mild to severe. Complications may include breathing problems, problems seeing, cleft palate, and hearing loss. Those affected generally have normal intelligence.
TCS is usually autosomal dominant. More than half the time it occurs as a result of a new mutation rather than being inherited. The involved genes may include &quot;TCOF1&quot;, &quot;POLR1C&quot;, or &quot;POLR1D&quot;. Diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and X-rays, and potentially confirmation by genetic testing.
Treacher Collins syndrome is not curable. Symptoms may be managed with reconstructive surgery, hearing aids, speech therapy, and other assistive devices. Life expectancy is generally normal. TCS occurs in about one in 50,000 people. The syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins, an English surgeon and ophthalmologist, who described its essential traits in 1900.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms in people with Treacher Collins syndrome vary. Some individuals are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed, while others have moderate to severe facial involvement and life-threatening airway compromise. Most of the features of TCS are symmetrical and are already recognizable at birth.

The most common symptom of Treacher Collins syndrome is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone. This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted. The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases, trouble breathing or swallowing. The respiratory system of a child with Treacher Collins syndrome is the primary concern at birth, with other issues only addressed once respiratory function has been stabilized. Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance.

The external ear is sometimes small, rotated, malformed, or absent entirely in people with TCS. Symmetric, bilateral narrowing or absence of the external ear canal, is also described. In most cases, the bones of the middle ear and the middle ear cavity are misshapen. Inner ear malformations are rarely described. As a result of these abnormalities, a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss.

Most affected people also experience eye problems, including coloboma (notches) in the lower eyelids, partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid, downward angled eyelids, drooping of upper and lower eyelids, and narrowing of the tear ducts. Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus, refractive errors, and anisometropia. It can also be caused by severely dry eyes, a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections.

Although an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for Treacher Collins syndrome, brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed. Cleft palate is also common.

Dental anomalies are seen in 60% of affected people, including tooth agenesis (33%), discoloration (enamel opacities) (20%), malplacement of the maxillary first molars (13%), and wide spacing of the teeth. In some cases, dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion. This can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth.

Less common features of TCS may add to an affected person&#x27;s breathing problems, including sleep apnea. Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing or absence of the choanae, the internal opening of the nasal passages, which may also be observed. Underdevelopment of the pharynx can also narrow the airway.

Features related to TCS that are seen less frequently include nasal deformities, high-arched palate, macrostomia, preauricular hair displacement, cleft palate, hypertelorism, notched upper eyelid, and congenital heart defects.

Although facial deformity is often associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, more than 95% of people affected with TCS have normal intelligence. The psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity can affect quality of life in individuals with TCS.

==Genetics==

Mutations in &quot;TCOF1&quot;, &quot;POLR1C&quot;, or &quot;POLR1D&quot; genes can cause Treacher Collins syndrome. &quot;TCOF1&quot; gene mutations are the most common cause of the disorder, with &quot;POLR1C&quot; and &quot;POLR1D&quot; gene mutations causing an additional 2% of cases. In individuals without an identified mutation in one of these genes, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown. The &quot;TCOF1&quot;, &quot;POLR1C&quot;, and &quot;POLR1D&quot; genes code for proteins which play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. Mutations in these genes reduce the production of rRNA, which may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues. It is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development. Mutations in &quot;TCOF1&quot; and &quot;POLR1D&quot; cause the autosomal dominant form of Treacher Collins, and mutations in &quot;POLR1C&quot; cause the autosomal recessive form.

===&quot;TCOF1&quot;===
&quot;TCOF1&quot; is the primary gene associated with TCS, a mutation in this gene being found in 90–95% of the individuals with TCS. However, in some individuals with typical symptoms of TCS, mutations in &quot;TCOF1&quot; have not been found. Investigation of the DNA has resulted in the identification of the kind of mutations found in &quot;TCOF1&quot;. The majority of mutations are small deletions or insertions, though splice site and missense mutations also have been identified.

Mutation analysis has unveiled more than 100 disease-causing mutations in &quot;TCOF1&quot;, which are mostly family-specific mutations. The only recurrent mutation accounts for about 17% of the cases.

&quot;TCOF1&quot; is found on the 5th chromosome in the 5q32 region. It codes for a relatively simple nucleolar protein called treacle, that is thought to be involved in ribosome assembly. Mutations in &quot;TCOF1&quot; lead to haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein. Haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism has only one functional copy of a gene, because the other copy is inactivated by a mutation. The one normal copy of the gene does not produce enough protein, causing disease. Haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein leads to a depletion of the neural crest cell precursor, which leads to a reduced number of crest cells migrating to the first and second pharyngeal arches. These cells play an important role in the development of the craniofacial appearance, and loss of one copy of treacle affects the cells&#x27; ability to form the bones and tissues of the face.

===Other mutations===
&quot;POLR1C&quot; and &quot;POLR1D&quot; mutations are responsible for a minority of cases of Treacher Collins. &quot;POLR1C&quot; is found on chromosome 6 at position 6q21.2 and &quot;POLR1D&quot; is found on chromosome 13 at position 13q12.2. Those genes code for a protein subunits shared between RNA polymerase I and III. Both of these polymerases are important for ribosome biogenesis.

==Diagnosis==
===Genetic counseling===
TCS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and the penetrance of the affected gene is almost complete. Some recent investigations, though, described some rare cases in which the penetrance in TCS was not complete. Causes may be a variable expressivity, an incomplete penetrance or germline mosaicism. Only 40% of the mutations are inherited. The remaining 60% are a result of a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation, where a child has a new mutation in the responsible gene and did not inherit it from either parent. In the outcome of the disease, inter- and intrafamilial variability occurs. This suggests that when an affected child is born, it is important to investigate the parents to determine whether the affected gene is present, because the parent could have a mild form of the disease that has not been diagnosed. In this case, the risk of having another affected child is 50%. If the parents do not have the affected gene, the recurrence risk appears to be low. In following generations, the severity of the clinical symptoms increases.

=== Prenatal diagnosis ===
Mutations in the main genes responsible for TCS can be detected with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Rare mutations may not be detected by these methods. Ultrasonography can be used to detect craniofacial abnormalities later in pregnancy, but may not detect milder cases.

===Clinical findings===
TCS is often first suspected with characteristic symptoms observed during a physical exam. However, the clinical presentation of TCS can resemble other diseases, making diagnosis difficult. The OMENS classification was developed as a comprehensive and stage-based approach to differentiate the diseases. This acronym describes five distinct dysmorphic manifestations, namely orbital asymmetry, mandibular hypoplasia, auricular deformity, nerve development, and soft-tissue disease.

Orbital symmetry
* O0: normal orbital size, position
* O1: abnormal orbital size
* O2: abnormal orbital position
* O3: abnormal orbital size and position
Mandible
* M0: normal mandible
* M1: small mandible and glenoid fossa with short ramus
* M2: ramus short and abnormally shaped
# 2A: glenoid fossa in anatomical acceptable position
# 2B: Temperomandibular joint inferiorly (TMJ), medially, anteriorly displaced, with severely hypoplastic condyle
* M3: Complete absence of ramus, glenoid fossa, and TMJ
Ear
* E0: normal ear
* E1: Minor hypoplasia and cupping with all structures present
* E2: Absence of external auditory canal with variable hypoplasia of the auricle
* E3: Malposition of the lobule with absent auricle, lobular remnant usually inferior anteriorly displaced
Facial nerve
* N0: No facial nerve involvement
* N1: Upper facial nerve involvement (temporal or zygomatic branches)
* N2: Lower facial nerve involvement (buccal, mandibular or cervical)
* N3: All branches affected
Soft tissue
* S0: No soft tissue or muscle deficiency
* S1: Minimal tissue or muscle deficiency
* S2: Moderate tissue or muscle deficiency
* S3: Severe tissue or muscle deficiency

===Radiographs===
A few techniques are used to confirm the diagnosis in TCS.

An orthopantomogram (OPG) is a panoramic dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional image from ear to ear. Particularly, OPG facilitates an accurate postoperative follow-up and monitoring of bone growth under a mono- or double-distractor treatment. Thereby, some TCS features could be seen on OPG, but better techniques are used to include the whole spectrum of TCS abnormalities instead of showing only the jaw abnormalities.

Another method of radiographic evaluation is taking an X-ray image of the whole head. The lateral cephalometric radiograph in TCS shows hypoplasia of the facial bones, like the malar bone, mandible, and the mastoid.

Finally, occipitomental radiographs are used to detect hypoplasia or discontinuity of the zygomatic arch.

===CT Scan===
A temporal-bone CT using thin slices makes it possible to diagnose the degree of stenosis and atresia of the external auditory canal, the status of the middle ear cavity, the absent or dysplastic and rudimentary ossicles, or inner ear abnormalities such as a deficient cochlea. Two- and three-dimensional CT reconstructions with VRT and bone and skin-surfacing are helpful for more accurate staging and the three-dimensional planning of mandibular and external ear reconstructive surgery.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other diseases have similar characteristics to Treacher Collins syndrome. In the differential diagnosis, one should consider the acrofacial dysostoses. The facial appearance resembles that of Treacher Collins syndrome, but additional limb abnormalities occur in those persons. Examples of these diseases are Nager syndrome and Miller syndrome.

The oculoauriculovertebral spectrum should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. An example is hemifacial microsomia, which primarily affects development of the ear, mouth, and mandible. This anomaly may occur bilaterally. Another disease which belongs to this spectrum is Goldenhar syndrome, which includes vertebral abnormalities, epibulbar dermoids and facial deformities.

==Treatment==
The treatment of individuals with TCS may involve the intervention of professionals from multiple disciplines. The primary concerns are breathing and feeding, as a consequence of the hypoplasia of the mandibula and the obstruction of the hypopharynx by the tongue. Sometimes, they may require a tracheostomy to maintain an adequate airway, and a gastrostomy to assure an adequate caloric intake while protecting the airway. Corrective surgery of the face is performed at defined ages, depending on the developmental state.

An overview of the present guidelines:
* If a cleft palate is present, the repair normally takes place at 9–12 months old. Before surgery, a polysomnography with a palatal plate in place is needed. This may predict the postoperative situation and gives insight on the chance of the presence of sleep apnea (OSAS) after the operation.
* Hearing loss is treated by bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and educational intervention to avoid language/speech problems. The bone-anchored hearing aid is an alternative for individuals with ear anomalies.
* Zygomatic and orbital reconstruction is performed when the cranio-orbitozygomatic bone is completely developed, usually at the age of 5–7 years. In children, an autologous bone graft is mostly used. In combination with this transplantation, lipofilling can be used in the periorbital area to get an optimal result of the reconstruction. Reconstruction of the lower eyelid coloboma includes the use of a myocutaneous flap, which is elevated and in this manner closes the eyelid defect.
* External ear reconstruction is usually done when the individual is at least eight years old. Sometimes, the external auditory canal or middle ear can also be treated.
* The optimal age for the maxillomandibular reconstruction is controversial; as of 2004, this classification has been used:
*# Type I (mild) and Type IIa (moderate) 13–16 years
*# Type IIb (moderate to severe malformation) at skeletal maturity
*# Type III (severe) 6–10 years
* When the teeth are cutting, the teeth should be under supervision of an orthodontist to make sure no abnormalities occur. If abnormalities like dislocation or an overgrowth of teeth are seen, appropriate action can be undertaken as soon as possible.
* Orthognathic treatments usually take place after the age of 16 years; at this point, all teeth are in place and the jaw and dentition are mature. Whenever OSAS is detected, the level of obstruction is determined through endoscopy of the upper airways. Mandibular advancement can be an effective way to improve both breathing and æsthetics, while a genioplasty only restores the profile.
* If a nose reconstruction is necessary, it is usually performed after the orthognathic surgery and after the age of 18 years.
* The contour of the facial soft tissues generally requires correction at a later age, because of the facial skeletal maturity. The use of microsurgical methods, like the free flap transfer, has improved the correction of facial soft tissue contours. Another technique to improve the facial soft tissue contours is lipofilling. For instance, lipofilling is used to reconstruct the eyelids.

===Hearing loss===
Hearing loss in Treacher Collins syndrome is caused by deformed structures in the outer and middle ear. The hearing loss is generally bilateral with a conductive loss of about 50–70 dB. Even in cases with normal auricles and open external auditory canals, the ossicular chain is often malformed.

Attempts to surgically reconstruct the external auditory canal and improve hearing in children with TCS have not yielded positive results.

Auditory rehabilitation with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) or a conventional bone conduction aid has proven preferable to surgical reconstruction.

===Psychiatric===
The disorder can be associated with a number of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, social phobia, and distress about body image. People who have this disorder may also experience discrimination, bullying, and name calling, especially when young. A multi-disciplinary team and parental support should include these issues.

==Epidemiology==
TCS occurs in about one in 50,000 births in Europe. Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in one in 10,000 to one in 50,000 births.

==History==
The syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins (1862–1932), the English surgeon and ophthalmologist who described its essential traits in 1900. In 1949, Adolphe Franceschetti and David Klein described the same condition on their own observations as &quot;mandibulofacial dysostosis&quot;. The term mandibulofacial dysostosis is used to describe the clinical features.

==Culture==
In July 1977, a New York Times article describing new plastic surgery techniques which could partially correct the appearance of those with Treacher Collins syndrome was widely circulated resulting in raised awareness of the disease.

Prior to beginning his comedy career, Bob Saget made a documentary short called &quot;Through Adam&#x27;s Eyes&quot; documenting his young nephew&#x27;s experiences undergoing facial reconstructive surgery due to Treacher Collins; the film won a student Academy Award.

The disorder was featured on the show &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, in the episode &quot;Blu Mondae&quot;. TLC&#x27;s &quot;Born Without a Face&quot; features Juliana Wetmore, who was born with the most severe case in medical history of this syndrome and is missing 30%–40% of the bones in her face.

In 2010, BBC Three documentary &quot;Love Me, Love My Face&quot; covered the case of a man, Jono Lancaster, with the condition. In 2011, BBC Three returned to Jono to cover his and his partner Laura&#x27;s quest to start a family, in &quot;So What If My Baby Is Born Like Me?&quot;, which first aired as part of a BBC Three season of programmes on parenting. The first film was replayed on BBC One shortly ahead of the second film&#x27;s initial BBC Three broadcast. Lancaster&#x27;s third BBC Three film, &quot;Finding My Family on Facebook&quot;, which looked at adoption, aired in 2011.
Lancaster&#x27;s memoir about living with the condition, &quot;Not All Heroes Wear Capes,&quot; published in 2023.

In &quot;Wonder&quot;, a children&#x27;s novel written by R. J. Palacio, the main character is a child who has Treacher Collins syndrome. A 2017 film adaptation of &quot;Wonder&quot;, starring Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson and Jacob Tremblay, was released in November 2017.

Alison Midstokke, who appears in the drama film &quot;Happy Face&quot; (2018), is an actress and activist who has the condition.

<text>Vincent Morrison Brennan (April 22, 1890 – February 4, 1959) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1921 to 1923.

==Early life and education==
Brennan was born in Mount Clemens, Michigan and moved with his parents to Detroit in 1895. He graduated from SS. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Parochial School, then from Detroit College in 1909, from the law department of Harvard University in 1912, and from the University of Detroit in 1914. He was admitted to the bar in 1912 and commenced practice in Detroit.

=== Early career ===
He was legal adviser to the Michigan State Labor Department in 1912 and 1913. He then served as assistant corporation counsel for the city of Detroit from 1915 to 1920.

=== State senate ===
He was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 2nd District in 1919 and 1920. He drafted the automobile traffic ordinance of Detroit, used as a model for many other cities.

=== Affiliations ===
He was also a Catholic and a member of the National Lawyers Guild, Knights of Columbus, and Delta Theta Phi

==Tenure in Congress==
Brennan was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 13th congressional district for the 67th Congress, serving from March 4, 1921, to March 3, 1923. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1922. Brennan introduced a bill in 1922, the first that proposed to allow radio coverage of U.S. House of Representatives proceedings. The bill failed, and the idea was not revived until the 1940s.

==After Congress==
After leaving Congress, he was elected judge of the circuit court of Wayne County, for the term commencing in January 1924 and was reelected for six successive terms, serving until his resignation effective December 31, 1954.

<doc id="1125773" wikidata="Q1884715" url="?curid=1125773" title="VOB">
<text>VOB (for video object) is the container format in DVD-Video media. VOB can contain digital video, digital audio, subtitles, DVD menus and navigation contents multiplexed together into a stream form. Files in VOB format may be encrypted.

==File format==
Files in VOB format have a codice_1 filename extension and are typically stored in the VIDEO_TS directory at the root of a DVD. The VOB format is based on the MPEG program stream format, but with additional limitations and specifications in the private streams. The MPEG program stream has provisions for non-standard data (as used in VOB files) in the form of so-called private streams. VOB files are a very strict subset of the MPEG program stream standard. While all VOB files are MPEG program streams, not all MPEG program streams comply with the definition for a VOB file.

Analogous to the MPEG program stream, a VOB file can contain H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 or MPEG-1 Part 2 video, MPEG-1 Audio Layer II or MPEG-2 Audio Layer II audio, but usage of these compression formats in a VOB file has some restrictions in comparison to the MPEG program stream. In addition, a VOB file can contain linear PCM, AC-3 or DTS audio and subpictures (subtitles). VOB files cannot contain AAC audio (MPEG-2 Part 7), MPEG-4 compression formats and others, which are allowed in the MPEG program stream standard.

On the DVD, all of the content for one title set is contiguous, but if necessary is broken up into 1 GB VOB files in order to be compatible with all operating systems, as some cannot read files larger than that size.

=== Companion files ===
VOB files may be accompanied with IFO and BUP files. These files respectively have codice_2 and codice_3 filename extensions.

IFO (information) files contain all the information a DVD player needs to know about a DVD so that the user can navigate and play all DVD content properly, such as where a chapter starts, where a certain audio or subtitle stream is located, information about menu functions and navigation. BUP (backup) files are exact redundant copies of IFO files, supplied to help in case of corruption. Video players may not allow DVD navigation when IFO or BUP files are absent.

==Copy protection==
Almost all commercially produced DVD-Video titles use some restriction or copy protection method, which also affects VOB files. Copy protection is usually used for copyrighted content.

Many DVD-Video titles are encrypted with Content Scramble System (CSS). This is a data encryption and communications authentication method designed to prevent copying video and audio data directly from the DVD-Video discs. Decryption and authentication keys needed for playing back encrypted VOB files are stored in the normally inaccessible lead-in area of the DVD and are used only by CSS decryption software (e.g., in a DVD player or software player). If someone is trying to copy the contents of an encrypted DVD-Video (e.g., VOB files) to a hard drive, an error can occur, because the DVD was not authenticated in the drive by CSS decryption software. Authentication of the disc allows the copying of individual VOB files without error, but the encryption keys will not be copied. If the copied undecrypted VOB files are opened in a player, they will request the keys from the DVD-ROM drive and will fail. There are many CSS-decrypting programs, or ripping software, such as libdvdcss, DeCSS, DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD or DVD Shrink which allow a protected DVD-Video disc to be played without access to the original key or copied to hard disk unscrambled. In some countries, their usage can be a violation of law (e.g. for non-personal use).

==Playback==
A player of generic MPEG-2 files can usually play unencrypted VOB files, which contain MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio. Other audio compression formats such as AC-3 or DTS are less widely supported.

KMPlayer, VLC media player, GOM player, Media Player Classic and more platform-specific players like ALLPlayer play VOB files.

==Other DVD containers==

Some DVD Recorders use DVD-VR format and store multiplexed audiovisual content in VRO containers. A VRO file is equivalent to a collection of DVD-Video VOB files. The VRO files can be played directly like a VOB if no editing is intended. Fragmented VRO files are not widely supported by software players and video editing software.

Enhanced VOB (EVO) is also an extension to VOB, originally meant for the now-discontinued HD DVD video. It can contain additional video and audio formats such H.264 and AAC.

<doc id="1125774" wikidata="Q1646629" url="?curid=1125774" title="Inside Job (Don Henley album)">
<text>Inside Job is the fourth solo studio album by Don Henley, the lead vocalist and drummer for the Eagles. The album was released through the Warner Bros. record label on May 23, 2000, the album was Henley&#x27;s last album of all-new material until the release of &quot;Cass County&quot; in 2015, as well as his first album to be recorded fully digitally. The album was the first solo album for Henley in 11 years, the album reached #7 on the charts and released two Adult Contemporary Tracks singles with &quot;Taking You Home&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Different Now&quot;. &quot;Taking You Home&quot; was also released as a single, and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it peaked at #58.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album, &quot;&quot;Inside Job&quot; lacks the melodic craftsmanship that made &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot; a blockbuster, and it isn&#x27;t as focused as &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, but it is a solid comeback record from an artist who spent a little too long out of the spotlight.&quot;

===Commercial===
The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 7 on its release in May 2000, then Henley&#x27;s highest-charting album. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA on July 12, 2000. The album has sold 1,124,000 copies in the US as of September 2015.

<text>Josie Lawrence (born Wendy Lawrence; 6 June 1959) is an English actress and comedian. She is best known for her work with the Comedy Store Players improvisational troupe, the television series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; and as Manda Best in &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born Wendy Lawrence on 6 June 1959 in Old Hill, West Midlands. Her parents were Bert Lawrence and Kathleen Lawrence, née Griffin, who were married in 1948. She has twin siblings, John and Janet, who are ten years her senior (1949). They were brought up in nearby Cradley Heath, where their father worked for British Leyland and their mother as a dinner lady. Lawrence wanted to be an actress at the early age of 5 and at 16 joined the Barlow Players in Oldbury.

She studied at Dartington College of Arts from 1978 to 1981, receiving a Bachelor of Arts honours degree.

==Career==
===Stage===
Her first acting role was as a young boy in a production of &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot; at the Half Moon Theatre (in 2016 she became a patron of the theatre). During the 1980s, she was also involved in a play called &quot;Passionaria&quot; at the Newcastle Playhouse, starring Denise Black and Kate McKenzie, and they later formed the jazz group Denise Black and the Kray Sisters.

Her work in comedy began as a result of starring in a Donmar Warehouse play called &quot;Songs For Stray Cats&quot; and hearing the audience invited to supply lines and ideas for improvisers appearing in after-show cabaret.
She starred as the title character in the 1993 Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith production of the musical &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;.

From 1994–96, Lawrence played Katharine in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in both Stratford-upon-Avon and London, for which she received a Dame Peggy Ashcroft award for Best Actress. She also appeared in &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and starred as Benedick in an all-female production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, having played Beatrice previously at Manchester&#x27;s Royal Exchange. She made her West End theatre debut in 2001 taking over the lead role of Anna in the stage musical &quot;The King and I&quot;, replacing Elaine Paige. In 2005, she appeared with Victoria Wood, Julie Walters and Celia Imrie in the cult West End production of Wood&#x27;s &quot;Acorn Antiques: The Musical&quot;.

In 2008, Lawrence took the lead role in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Hapgood&quot; at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and later at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in which she was a secret spymaster given the task of exposing a traitor who is leaking vital information to the Russians. In the same year, she co-directed &quot;The Time Step&quot;, a comedy about fantasies and talent contests, with Linda Marlowe at the Edinburgh Festival.

Lawrence appeared as Madame Ranevskaya in a new version of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, translated by Tom Stoppard, at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in autumn 2010.

===Film and television===
Lawrence came to public attention as a regular performer on the Channel 4 improvisational comedy series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; at its launch in 1988. Lawrence&#x27;s speciality on the show was her ability to improvise songs on the spot. She was the first female performer to appear on the show, featuring in both the original pilot episode and the first broadcast episode. Lawrence was featured on &quot;Whose Line&quot; until its ninth series in 1997 and 1998, which was the last of the UK series to actually be filmed in the UK. She also performed in two episodes of the American edition of the show in 1999.

In 1991, she had her own short-lived comedy series , also on Channel 4.

In 2009, Lawrence raised £25,000 for Sunfield by appearing on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; with Meera Syal.

Lawrence and Shane Richie participated in the final leg of the celebrity &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; challenge to raise money for Children in Need 2009. They travelled from Memphis to Wilmington, North Carolina and then to London over 15 days.

==Honours and personal life==
Lawrence is single. In an interview with Jim Sweeney, she said of being asked why she is unmarried, &quot;It&#x27;s always the same: &#x27;You&#x27;re 41 and not married and no kids.&#x27; God, I&#x27;m so bored with it.&quot; She resides in Hackney, London. She has two cats, a long-haired ginger (Aynuk) and a black-and-white (Ayli), named after the Black Country characters Aynuk and Ayli, who feature prominently in jokes about Black Country dialect.

<text>Ombo is an island in the municipality of Stavanger in Rogaland county, Norway. The island is the largest island in the Ryfylke region and the second largest island in Rogaland county. 

There are several villages on the island, including Jørstadvåg, where Jørstad Church is located, Atlatveit, and Eidssund in the western part of the island and the villages of Tuftene, Skipavik, Skår, and Vestersjø are located on the southeastern part of the island. The island is the northeastern most part of the vast Stavanger municipality, nearly from the city of Stavanger, the administrative centre of the municipality.

Prior to 2020, the island was divided between the municipalities Hjelmeland and Finnøy. In 2020, the island joined Stavanger municipality.

Ombo is located north of the islands of Randøy and Halsnøya, northeast of the island of Finnøy, and east of the Sjernarøyane archipelago. The highest point on the island is the tall &quot;Bandåsen&quot;. Ombo is surrounded by fjords that are connected to the main Boknafjorden. The Ombofjorden to the east, Gardssundfjorden to the south, Gapafjorden to the west, and Jelsafjorden to the north.

After the road was built around the island of Ombo, a distinctive rock formation was visible from the new road. The rock formation looks like a face, and was originally named Adam. Among the local residents, this is also called &quot;Ombo-gubben&quot;.

There are no outside road connections to Ombo—it is only accessible by boat. There are regular ferry connections that stop at Eidssund on the west coast from Judaberg, Sjernarøyane, Nedstrand, Jelsa, Halsnøya, and Fogn. There are also regular ferry connections from Skipavik on the eastern shore of the island to Nesvik and Hjelmelandsvågen on the mainland.

<text>Voter suppression are tactics used to discourage or prevent specific groups of people from voting or registering to vote. It is distinguished from political campaigning in that campaigning attempts to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through persuasion and organization, activating otherwise inactive voters, or registering new supporters. Voter suppression, instead, attempts to gain an advantage by reducing the turnout of certain voters. Suppression is an anti-democratic tactic associated with authoritarianism.

The tactics of voter suppression range from changes that increase voter fatigue, to intimidating or harming prospective voters.

== Impact ==
Some argue the term &#x27;voter suppression&#x27; downplays the harm done when voices are not reflected in an election, calling for terms like &#x27;vote destruction&#x27; that accounts for the permanence of each vote not being cast. Making it harder to vote for people who have been given the right, can lead to voter fatigue. Skewing the electorate jeopardizes the wisdom of the crowd, and the decision-making benefits it brings. Suppression does not require intent. Analyzing the turnout of eligible voters provides a partial way to study cumulative voter suppression impacts under specific conditions, though other avenues such as election subversion, gerrymandering, and corruption, cannot always be captured by voter turnout metrics. Additionally, some of the rules that end up suppressing votes can also be used as a pretext for throwing out votes, even when voter fraud is extremely rare.

== By type ==
=== Ballot design ===
A half-million Americans had their votes disqualified in 2008 and 2010 due to ballot design issues, including confusing instructions. The order of politicians on the ballot can also give one candidate an edge, while the length of a ballot can overwhelm voters, pushing them from the electorate for some or all races and increasing the wait times in lines for in-person voters.

=== Day-of experience ===
Requiring people to travel long distances and/or wait in long lines, for example suppresses voter turnout. Some parties in Europe that have less support among expats have made it much more difficult for them to cast ballots by removing vote by mail options, forcing some to travel hundreds of kilometers.

Weekend (such as Saturday voting in Australia), also contributes to higher turnout than weekday voting, maybe even more than having Election Day as a recognized holiday. A study in the UK found that when the sun sets later in the day, turnout tends to improve.

The Cost of Voting Index estimates how much more difficult the voting experience is on average in states around the U.S. 78% of respondents in one preferred vote-by-mail to voting in-person.

=== Disenfranchisement ===
The disenfranchisement of voters due to age, residence, citizenship, or criminal record are among the more recent examples of ways that elections can be subverted by changing who is allowed to vote. Most countries set their voting age to 18, thus disenfranchising citizens below that age. In many countries, like Germany, disenfrachisement is an additional penalty to certain crimes, such as treason or electoral fraud. In others such as India, all prisoners lose the right to vote during the duration of their imprisonment. Some jurisdictions may disenfranchise felons for life, including some (but not all) states of the United States of America.

=== Frequent elections ===

Frequent elections increase the amount of time and attention required of voters, typically leading to lower turnout among certain types of voters. Two-round elections (including primary elections), recall elections, and off-year elections are some examples of elections that contribute to voter fatigue. For example, Japan, Switzerland and the United States have the lowest voter turnout rates among developed countries due to holding frequent elections.

=== Identification ===
Photo identification requirements to vote can disenfranchise many voters especially the young, elderly, lower-income people, recently transitioned individuals, people of color, recently married women and people with disabilities. Additionally, the implementation of signature-matching processes, especially for mail-in ballots, can also be done so strictly as to suppress orders of magnitude more votes than the actual fraud that it prevents.
A Brennan Center estimate that 11% of Americans did not have the type of photo id recently required by many states. A solution implemented in a number of countries is to automatically send free ID cards to all its citizens.

=== Influence of money ===
Less-regulated campaign spending reduces the influence of every vote by giving more power to wealthy people, special interests and lobbyists. Corruption presents a more widely-recognized form of election subversion or electoral fraud where votes or positions are acquired illegally using money.

=== Information warfare ===

Misinformation, disinformation, and the platforms that are incentivized to boost half-truths and lies are forms of information warfare that can be used to confuse, intimidate, or deceive voters. When misinformation and disinformation is amplified by the laundering of foreign money through domestic nonprofit organizations or other allied domestic actors, charges of treason can be brought against these actors for colluding with a foreign power.

Common examples include undermining journalism, academia, political speech and other fundamental exchanges of ideas and information. Free or low-cost sources of information, such as through libraries, schools, nonprofits, public media, or open-source projects (like Wikipedia), have historically supported this key democratic prerequisite. For example, two-thirds of U.S. college students in one study cited a lack of information as a reason for why they did not vote.

=== Intimidation and violence ===
Intimidation can result from the presence of cameras or guns at polling places to ballots that may not be secret. Following-through on threats by physically harming or killing people can severely deter voter participation.

=== Path dependence/tyranny of the past ===
The lack of intergenerational equity in policy undermines the ability of voters to pursue self-determination through their democratic processes. For example, the lifetime appointments of judges, or constitutions that are so difficult to change that they do not reflect the values of current voters, show how power allocated in the past can thwart voter power in the present. This kind of lock-in is only helpful if the present is less democratic than the past, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy by simultaneously hampering the democratic innovations and evolutions that could prevent those threats by bolstering ancient architecture with the latest best-practices. Past actions can also create other kinds of path dependence, where power to shape democratic institutions can be slowed down or subverted by decisions made by those who wielded power in the past, regardless of how fairly (democratically) those setting the rules came to power and regardless of the values held by or information available to voters in the present. A relatively tangible example could be a country allowing itself to run up a large national debt that present-day voters did not consent to, shrinking discretionary spending to a fraction of what previous voters were able to spend.

===Registration or enrollment===
Voter registration (or enrollment) is an extra step in the election process creates extra work for voters, especially those who move often and are new to the system, thereby suppressing their votes. Registration has been the number one reason why citizens in the US do not vote, which is why most democracies automatically enroll their citizens. Same-day registration is another tool to make registration less of a barrier. In addition, the existence of the process itself opens up more opportunities to make the process intentionally difficult or impossible, including aggressive voter roll purges. The Cost of Voting Index quantifies some of the differences in voter registration experiences in US states.

==== Party membership requirements ====
Another example where registration can suppress votes is requiring a declared party preference, which is required in closed primaries in the United States for example, dissuading voters who do not want to declare a party preference in order to weigh-in on who represents them. Open primaries allow anyone to vote regardless of party preference or affiliation. In some more authoritarian states, loyal party membership may be required to have a say, or even basic rights and privileges.

=== Voter apathy ===
Voters may be discouraged from voting by weak cultural norms around voting. Countries without universal voting signal that voting is unimportant. A voting culture can be developed by reinforcing how voting is valued, expected and a centerpiece of a place&#x27;s culture, as peer pressure and a sense of belonging are powerful incentives to do something collectively.

Some proposals for reform include requiring that every selection have a &#x27;none of the above&#x27; option, allow a wide range of valid excuses for not voting for conscientious objectors, and charging a low, non-compounding, non-criminal fee for those who do not vote or select a valid reason.

=== Wasted votes ===
Winner-take-all systems (unlike in systems with proportional representation), are especially vulnerable to weakening and wasting certain votes year after year. This phenomenon also suppresses turnout for that and other elections help simultaneously in states that are not competitive, suppressing the popular vote for president in the US, for example, while lowering turnout in a host of other contests. In contrast, a parliamentary system typically significantly reduces wasted (suppressed) votes, helping to ensure more vote equality and encouraging greater overall participation.

Ballot referendum can also be a powerful avenue for changing political systems, for example, that are not as responsive to voters due to gerrymandering or other anti-democratic actions and policies.

==By country==
===Australia===
Australian citizens are expected to enroll to vote, and it is their responsibility to update their enrollment when they change their address. Even so, an estimated 6% of eligible Australian voters are not enrolled or are enrolled incorrectly. They are disproportionately younger voters, many of whom might neglect to enroll when they attain voting age.

In 2006, the Howard government legislated to close the electoral roll much earlier once an election was called than before. Previously, voters had been allowed seven days of grace after an election had been called to arrange or update their enrollment, but new voters were now allowed only until 8:00 p.m. on the day that the electoral writ was issued to lodge their enrollment form, and those who needed to update their addresses were allowed three days. In Australia, the Prime Minister effectively has the right to determine the date of the election as long as constitutional rules regarding the maximum term of the parliament are adhered to. That measure was therefore likely to result in many newer voters being precluded from voting in the first election for which they were eligible because the time to arrange their enrollment once an election is called had been greatly reduced.

The measure was widely seen as an attempt at voter suppression aimed at younger voters since surveys had shown that younger voters are more likely than the general population to vote for the Australian Labor Party or the Greens than Howard&#x27;s Liberal Party. The government denied that it was trying to suppress some voters and insisted that the purposes of the reform were a smoother administration of the elections and the reduction of the possibility of electoral fraud. However, the Australian Electoral Commission had requested no such reform, there had been no evidence of significant electoral fraud, and the Australian Electoral Commission had been dealing with hundreds of thousands of late enrollments without significant problems for decades.

In July 2010, the left-wing lobby group GetUp! launched a challenge to the law. The High Court of Australia expedited the hearing so that a ruling could be made in time for the 2010 federal election. The majority ruling struck down early closing of the roll and reinstated the old rule allowing voters seven days grace to arrange or update their enrollment.

=== Brazil ===

In the 2022 Brazilian general election, there were attempts by police and political sympathisers to make it more difficult for lower-income people to attend polling stations. Some public transport services were temporary reduced, spot inspections of vehicles and public transport were increased in poorer areas of the country, and roadblocks set up to disrupt and delay traffic.

=== Canada ===
Shortly before the 2011 Canadian federal election, voter suppression tactics were exercised by issuing robocalls and live calls, which falsely advised voters that their polling station had been changed. The locations offered by those messages were intentionally false, often led voters several hours from the correct stations, and often identified themselves illegally as coming from Elections Canada. In litigation brought by the Council of Canadians, a federal court found that such fraud had occurred and had probably been perpetrated by someone with access to the Conservative Party&#x27;s voter database, including its information about voter preferences. The court stated that the evidence did not prove that the Conservative Party or that its successful candidates had been directly involved, but it criticized the Conservative Party for making &quot;little effort to assist with the investigation.&quot; The court did not annul the result in any of six ridings where the fraud had occurred because it concluded that the number of votes affected had been too small to change the outcome.

=== France ===
In France, as in some other countries with Voter Registration, requirements and processes to update your address suppress voter turnout disproportionately against people who move more often, who tend to be younger, for example.

=== Israel ===

In April 2019, during Israel&#x27;s general elections for the 21st Knesset, Likud activists installed hidden cameras in polling stations in Arab communities. Election observers were seen wearing such cameras. Hanan Melcer, the Head of the General Elections Committee, called the cameras illegal. The following day, the public relations agency Kaizler Inbar took credit for the operation and said it had been planned in collaboration with Likud. It claimed that voter turnout in Arab communities had fallen under 50% by the presence of the agency&#x27;s observers in the polling stations, though some of this decrease is likely due to a boycott that was planned for the vote.

===United Kingdom===
Lutfur Rahman was the directly-elected mayor of Tower Hamlets for the British Labour Party. He was removed from office after being convicted of breaches of electoral law when his supporters intimidated voters at polling stations.

===United States===

In the United States, elections are administered locally (though with many election rules set by states and the federal government), and forms of voter suppression vary among jurisdictions. When the country was founded, the right to vote in most states was limited to property-owning white males. Over time, the right to vote was granted to racial minorities, women, and youth.

In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, Southern states passed Jim Crow laws to suppress poor and racial minority voters that involved poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. Most of those voter suppression tactics were made illegal after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even after the repeal of those statutes, there have been repetited incidents of racial discrimination against voters, especially in the South. For example, 87,000 people in Georgia were unable to vote in 2018 because of late registration. Many of the strictest voting regulations are in swing states and have been enacted primarily by U.S. Republican Party politicians. According to AMP Reports, many people who were predicted to be in favor of voting for the U.S. Democratic Party had their ballot dismissed. The study&#x27;s analysis noted, &quot;A disproportionate number of those potential voters were people of color or young voters, groups that typically favor Democrats.&quot; The history of the previous Jim Crow regulations in the Southern states affects the voter suppression today because minorities often have their vote dismissed by the manipulation of voting regulations.

One analysis of a Florida election in 2012 found that 200,000+ people did not vote because of long lines. Some Floridians were forced to wait 6–7 hours to vote.

In 2013, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, several states enacted voter ID laws. Some argue that such laws amount to voter suppression against African-Americans.

In Texas, a voter ID law requiring a driver&#x27;s license, passport, military identification, or gun permit was repeatedly found to be intentionally discriminatory. The state&#x27;s election laws could be put back under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, however, the DOJ expressed support for Texas&#x27;s ID law. Sessions was accused by Coretta Scott King in 1986 of trying to suppress the black vote. A similar ID law in North Dakota, which would have disenfranchised many Native Americans, was also overturned.

In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state&#x27;s restrictive voter ID law had led to &quot;real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities.&quot; Since there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, it found that the law was &quot;a cure worse than the disease.&quot; In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law reduced early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters.

Other controversial measures include shutting down Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices in minority neighborhoods, which makes it more difficult for residents to obtain voter IDs; shutting down polling places in minority neighborhoods; systematically depriving precincts in minority neighborhoods of the resources needed to operate efficiently, such as poll workers and voting machines; and purging voters from the rolls shortly before an election.

Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such laws even if the incidence is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud, none of which being cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, &quot;We&#x27;ve not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa.&quot;

In May 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission was led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database, which is designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck&#x27;s algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives. Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.

<text>Minh Le (Vietnamese: Lê Minh; born June 27, 1977), also known by his online nickname Gooseman, is a Vietnamese Canadian video game programmer who co-created the &quot;Half-Life&quot; mod &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; with Jess Cliffe in 1999 and started the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series. He was later employed by Valve, the developers of &quot;Half-Life&quot;, and worked for 8 years in Korea on the multiplayer first-person shooter &quot;Tactical Intervention&quot;. He is a contractor on the multiplayer survival first-person shooter &quot;Rust&quot;. In the small-team games that he has worked on, Le has been a programmer, modeler, and designer.

His nickname comes from Shane Gooseman, one of the main characters of 1980s cartoon series &quot;The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers&quot;.

==Biography==
Minh Le was born in Vietnam. In 1979, he and his parents left Vietnam on a boat and immigrated to Canada as refugees.

Le attended Simon Fraser University from 1996 to 2001, graduating in 2001 with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Computing Science. His curriculum and electives were &quot;focused mainly on computer graphics courses covering subjects such as compression algorithms, 3D animation techniques, image recognition.&quot;

Le picked up id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; in 1996 and began playing with its software development kit, and after about a year he completed his first mod, &quot;Navy SEALs&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;″s spiritual predecessor. While he was working on the &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; mod, he came up with the idea for &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and became friends with &quot;Action Quake 2&quot;″s webmaster Jess Cliffe and Marcelo Dilay.

Le began work on &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; as a mod for &quot;Half-Life&quot; while he was in the middle of his fourth year at Simon Fraser University (he later graduated with a degree in computer science). He spent about 20 hours a week on making the mod, expending more effort on it than he did on his schoolwork, and released the first beta version in June 1999. The &quot;Counter-Strike Team&quot; quickly produced several more beta releases in the following months as the game&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed.

By the fourth beta version, Valve, the developer who created &quot;Half-Life&quot;, began assisting in the development of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. In 2000, Valve bought the rights to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and hired Le and Cliffe to work with them in Bellevue, Washington, where Le continued to work on &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and related games. During this time he was developing &quot;Counter-Strike 2&quot;, however Valve eventually put this project on hold indefinitely.

After &quot;Counter-Strike 2&quot; was shelved, Le left Valve in 2006 to work on a project of his own. After two years working with a small team on this project, he moved to South Korea in 2008 to work with a business named FIX Korea who provided funding for further development. Le&#x27;s new game was later revealed to be &quot;Tactical Intervention&quot;, a game similar in style to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; created with a modified version of Valve&#x27;s Source engine.

In October 2013, he joined Facepunch Studios, where he worked on &quot;Rust&quot;. He left Facepunch Studios in February 2018.

In March 2018, he joined Pearl Abyss to start working on a new project for the game studio that made the MMORPG &quot;Black Desert Online&quot;.

==Recognition==

In 2003, a GameSpy editorial cited Minh Le as the most important reason &quot;Half-Life&quot; was still popular five years after it was released. IGN ranked Jess Cliffe and Minh Le as number 14 in their &quot;Top 100 Game Creators of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Gary Paul O&#x27;Neil (born 18 May 1983) is an English football manager and former player who was most recently head coach of Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

A midfielder, O&#x27;Neil made 214 Premier League appearances and scored 16 goals between 2003 and 2016, representing Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, West Ham United and Norwich City. He also played in the Football League First Division or EFL Championship for all four of those clubs plus Walsall, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Bristol City and Bolton Wanderers.

In his first job as a manager, O&#x27;Neil led AFC Bournemouth to a 15th place finish in the 2022–23 Premier League, but was then dismissed ahead of the following season. He was appointed head coach by Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2023 and sacked from the position in December 2024.

==Club career==

===Portsmouth===
O&#x27;Neil was born in Beckenham, London and grew up in Downham. Tony Pulis gave O&#x27;Neil his Portsmouth debut as a 16-year-old on 29 January 2000 at home to Barnsley in the First Division, but kept him out of the spotlight for the rest of the season. The following year both Pulis and his successor Steve Claridge used O&#x27;Neil sparingly but Portsmouth&#x27;s third manager of a disastrous season, Graham Rix, made O&#x27;Neil a starter for the final five matches of the season. Portsmouth went into the final game against Barnsley needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to what was then the Second Division. They won the match 3–0 and survived, with O&#x27;Neil scoring the second goal, his first in professional football.

In the 2001–02 season, O&#x27;Neil scored a volley against his boyhood club Millwall. When Harry Redknapp took over as manager at the end of the season, O&#x27;Neil was one of the few players not to be moved on in the rebuilding of the squad. In Redknapp&#x27;s first full season O&#x27;Neil only started 11 league matches, scoring three goals, as Portsmouth won the First Division title and promotion to the Premier League.

O&#x27;Neil was loaned to Walsall at the beginning of the 2003–04 season in order to gain first team experience. His performances for the Midlands side and Portsmouth&#x27;s increasing injury problems led to a recall in November 2003. He went straight into the starting eleven for his Premier League debut against bottom of the table Leeds United at Fratton Park and scored two goals in a 6–1 win. This performance meant that he maintained his place for the next match, away at Fulham but then had to travel to Dubai to captain England Under 20s in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Upon his return, O&#x27;Neil found that Portsmouth&#x27;s injury problems had cleared up and he could not break back into the team for the remainder of the season.

At the beginning of the 2004–05 season he was loaned to Cardiff City to gain further first team experience, scoring once in the league against Millwall. He was recalled to Portsmouth in November who yet again were experiencing an injury crisis. He made his return to the side in one of the biggest matches of the season, a 2–1 defeat at Southampton. He was picked again for the next match, at home to Manchester City, and scored in a 3–1 loss. This was the last match of Redknapp&#x27;s reign, and technical director Velimir Zajec took over a temporary manager and made O&#x27;Neil a regular in the Pompey midfield. During Zajec&#x27;s five-month reign Portsmouth fell from midtable to relegation candidates and Alain Perrin was appointed to keep the club in the Premier League. O&#x27;Neil scored away at Manchester United and European champions Liverpool bid £5 million for him, which was rejected by Portsmouth.

O&#x27;Neil went into the 2005–06 season as a regular for Perrin&#x27;s new-look team and, like in the 2002–03 campaign, he was one of the few players to survive from the previous year. By November Portsmouth were at the bottom of the Premier League and Perrin was sacked only seven months after being appointed. In Redknapp&#x27;s first match back in charge at Tottenham Hotspur, O&#x27;Neil retained his place in the team and was picked on the right of midfield. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s late handball conceded the penalty for Spurs&#x27; winner. O&#x27;Neil was moved into his preferred position of central midfield a few games later and Pompey went on their best run of the season with O&#x27;Neil scoring in successive home games. For the home game with Everton in January 2006 O&#x27;Neil captained Pompey for the first time but disappointingly for him this was also the game where he was moved back to the right to allow new signings Pedro Mendes and Sean Davis to form a partnership in the middle. Pompey lost the game 1–0 and went on a run of form that left them near certainties for relegation in mid-March but O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s performance in a crucial 1–1 draw against Bolton Wanderers saw him keep his place in the starting XI. Two weeks after this draw, Pedro Mendes&#x27; last minute winner against Manchester City sparked a comeback. Pompey gained 14 points out of the next seven games and secured survival at Wigan Athletic&#x27;s JJB Stadium on 29 April with a 2–1 victory.

O&#x27;Neil was a regular at the right of midfield for Portsmouth in the 2006–07 and despite only contributing one goal Portsmouth finished 9th, their best in the Premier League at that time.

===Middlesbrough===

O&#x27;Neil signed for Middlesbrough on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £5 million. Reports surfacing in May 2008 suggested that O&#x27;Neil might look to move on from Middlesbrough after he and his family had failed to settle on Teesside.
O&#x27;Neil scored his first Middlesbrough goal in the 2008–09 season on 29 October in Middlesbrough&#x27;s 2–0 win over Manchester City.

O&#x27;Neil started the 2009–10 season as manager Gareth Southgate&#x27;s first choice central midfielder, with Julio Arca being dropped to the bench for the first matches of the season. It was soon revealed that O&#x27;Neil would require a hernia operation, yet he spoke out and said he would, &quot;Delay the operation so as to ease Boro&#x27;s midfield crisis.&quot; The first game after his operation, on 12 September, led to his first goal. He was taken down in the box yet managed to pull himself up to loop Marvin Emnes&#x27; return ball over the Ipswich Town keeper in a 3–1 win. O&#x27;Neil managed 119 appearances and scored seven goals in total for Boro.

===West Ham United===
On 25 January 2011, O&#x27;Neil completed a move to West Ham United on a -year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in the League Cup semi-final, second leg, against Birmingham City, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Luis Boa Morte. On 6 February 2011, O&#x27;Neil made his Premier League debut for the Hammers against Birmingham City in a 1–0 defeat at Upton Park and also completed the full 90 minutes. His 2010–11 season was ended prematurely on 16 April 2011 following a tackle by Aston Villa&#x27;s Nigel Reo-Coker during West Ham&#x27;s 2–1 home defeat at Upton Park. O&#x27;Neil was carried off on a stretcher after the challenge. He underwent a two-hour ankle operation and endured several months out of action with concern that his footballing career was in jeopardy. O&#x27;Neil was reported as considering taking legal action against Reo-Coker. By the end of the 2010–11 season, he had made nine appearances for the Hammers in all competitions.

O&#x27;Neil scored his first goal for West Ham in a 4–1 away win against Blackpool on 21 February 2012 and proved to be a key player in the team&#x27;s end of season form which saw them reach the Premier League after beating Blackpool 2–1 at Wembley in the Championship play-off final. On 7 June 2013, the Premier League confirmed that he had been released by West Ham. Although released, O&#x27;Neil said that discussions were taking place related to him being offered a new contract and that he was likely to sign a new deal nearer the start of the new season. However, David Gold announced on his Twitter account that O&#x27;Neil had declined a new contract offer, and consequently became a free agent.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 7 August 2013, O&#x27;Neil signed for Championship side Queens Park Rangers on a one-year deal, re-uniting with former manager Harry Redknapp. He scored his first goal for the club on 11 January 2014 in a 3–1 win over Ipswich Town. O&#x27;Neil was a member of the Queens Park Rangers side which won the 2014 Football League Championship play-off final, 1–0 against Derby County on 24 May 2014. He was sent off in the 60th minute in the game at Wembley for a professional foul on Johnny Russell.

===Norwich City===
On 5 August 2014, O&#x27;Neil signed for Championship side Norwich City, on a two-year deal. At the end of his contract he left the club.

===Bristol City===
On 9 June 2016, O&#x27;Neil signed for Championship side Bristol City on a two-year contract starting on 1 July 2016. He scored his first goal for Bristol City in a 2–1 loss at Reading on 26 November 2016.

He was released by Bristol City at the end of the 2017–18 season.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 3 August 2018, he completed a move to Bolton Wanderers on an initial short-term contract until January 2019, following a successful trial spell at the University of Bolton Stadium. He made his Bolton debut a day after signing, when coming on as a second-half substitute for fellow debutant Luke Murphy in a 2–1 win over West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.

He played over thirty games for Bolton in 2018–19, scoring in the games against Rotherham United, Millwall and Wigan Athletic, but could not prevent the club from being relegated to League One. However, his efforts were recognised by the club&#x27;s supporters as he won the Player of the Year award.

==International career==
O&#x27;Neil earned caps for England at every youth level, and captained England at the 2003 FIFA under-20 World Youth Championship. He made nine appearances for the England under-21 team.

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
In August 2020, O&#x27;Neil was appointed as assistant manager to Barry Lewtas for Liverpool&#x27;s under-23 squad.

Following the appointment of Jonathan Woodgate as manager of Championship club AFC Bournemouth until the end of the 2020–21 season, O&#x27;Neil joined Bournemouth as senior first team coach on 23 February 2021. He remained at the club following Woodgate&#x27;s departure at the end of the season, and was a part of the coaching staff that got the club promoted to the Premier League under new manager Scott Parker in 2021–22.

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 August 2022, O&#x27;Neil was placed in caretaker charge by Bournemouth following Parker&#x27;s dismissal. He took charge of the team for the first time the following day, in a 0–0 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers, before picking up his first victory in the club&#x27;s following match, a 3–2 victory against Nottingham Forest on 3 September. They would remain unbeaten for four more games, including a 2–1 victory against Leicester on 8 October, while O&#x27;Neil garnered a nomination for Premier League Manager of the Month for the team&#x27;s performances in September. He remained in caretaker charge until the season paused for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, adding another Premier League victory, against Everton on 12 November, during that stretch. On 27 November, having picked up 13 points from a possible 33, O&#x27;Neil was appointed as Bournemouth&#x27;s permanent head coach, signing an initial 18-month contract.

In the eight games immediately following O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s permanent appointment the club failed to pick up a single competitive win. However, in April 2023, O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s side secured their place in the top flight by winning five matches out of seven, including victories over relegation contenders Leicester City, Southampton and Leeds United. Despite this success however, on 19 June 2023, Bournemouth announced they had dismissed O&#x27;Neil and appointed former Rayo Vallecano manager Andoni Iraola to replace him.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 9 August 2023, O&#x27;Neil was appointed head coach of Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-year deal, replacing Julen Lopetegui who had left due to disputes with the board. He became the club&#x27;s first English-born manager since Kenny Jackett left in 2016. On his debut four days later, the team lost by a single goal away to Manchester United in which Wolves had a penalty appeal turned down in added time. Jon Moss, the referees&#x27; manager, apologised to O&#x27;Neil and said it was the wrong call.

When Wolves became the first team in the 2023–24 Premier League to beat reigning champions Manchester City on 30 September 2023, O&#x27;Neil became only the second English coach to defeat Manchester City in the Pep Guardiola era.

O&#x27;Neil led Wolves to success in a Black Country derby against West Bromwich Albion, at the first time of asking as Wolves coach, in the fourth round of the FA Cup on 28 January 2024 - the team securing a 2–0 victory at The Hawthorns. It was Wolves&#x27; first success in any match against West Brom since 2011, their first win at The Hawthorns since 1996, and the team&#x27;s first FA Cup tie victory over the Baggies since 1949.

On 15 December 2024, O&#x27;Neil was sacked by Wolverhampton Wanderers following a 2-1 home defeat to Ipswich Town. At the time, Wolves were 19th in the league, four points from safety. They had suffered 11 defeats and achieved only two wins in the 2024–25 season. O&#x27;Neil also struggled with discipline in his final two games, with both ending in brawls; Mario Lemina lost the captaincy for a confrontation with West Ham&#x27;s Jarrod Bowen, while Rayan Aït-Nouri was sent off after the Ipswich game, which also saw Matheus Cunha appear to fight with staff from the opposing club. O&#x27;Neil said he &quot;never had such a struggle&quot; to coach players. Vítor Pereira replaced him. 

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neil married Donna Guerin in 2006. As of March 2023, they have two daughters and a son; the son has acted on television series such as &quot;Grantchester&quot; and joined AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s academy in 2023, aged 9.

<doc id="1125797" wikidata="Q7845574" url="?curid=1125797" title="Troops of Horse Guards">
<text>In the British Army, the Horse Guards comprised several independent troops raised initially on the three different establishments. In the late 1660s, there were thus three troops in England, one in Ireland, and two in Scotland of which one was ceremonial for attendance of Lord High Commissioner (named after John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton and after John Leslie, 7th Earl of Rothes). In 1707, there were four troops of Horse Guards (the three original English and one Scots), and two troops of Horse Grenadiers.

From 1658 to 1788, the Horse Guards existed as independent troops. They were placed on the English establishment in 1661, with the founding of the modern Regular British Army. In 1788, as part of the re-organisation of the British Army, the remaining 1st and 2nd Troops were united with the 1st and 2nd Troops of Horse Grenadier Guards to form, respectively, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards.

Originally, as befitted their role as bodyguards to the Sovereign, the ranks of these Troops were filled by members of the gentry. They, therefore, had no non-commissioned officers, their &quot;brigadiers&quot; (i.e. corporals) being commissioned and ranking as lieutenants, their &quot;sub-brigadiers&quot; (i.e. sub-corporals) ranking with cornets in the rest of the army.
Although this no longer obtains, the non-commissioned officers of their successor regiment, the Life Guards, are still grades of Corporal, rather than sergeants.

==1st Troop [1658-1788]==

*1658-1788 1st (His Majesty&#x27;s Own) Troop of Horse Guards [formed in exile in Holland from followers of Charles II].
*1746 absorbed 3rd Troop, The Horse Guards.
*1788 absorbed 1st Troop, The Horse Grenadier Guards and was reorganised to form the 1st Regiment of Life Guards

==2nd Troop [1659-1788]==

*1659 [raised as a Parliamentary life guard for attending the Council of State].
* Nov 1659 re-modelled as Monck&#x27;s Life Guards
*1660-1661 3rd (The Duke of Albemarle&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards.
*1661-1670 3rd (The Lord General&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards.
*1670-1788 2nd (The Queen&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards.
*1788 absorbed 4th Troop, The Horse Guards.
*1788 On 8 June it absorbs the 2nd Troop, The Horse Grenadier Guards, and on 25 June it is reorganised to form the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards.

==3rd Troop [1658-1746]==

*1658-1670 2nd (The Duke of York&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards [formed in exile in Holland from followers of Charles II]
*1670-1746 3rd (The Duke of York&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards
*1746 absorbed by 1st Troop, The Horse Guards.

==Scots and 4th Troop==
=== 4th Troop [1686-1689] ===
*1686-1689 4th (Lord Dover&#x27;s) Troop of Horse Guards [Disbanded upon the deposing of James II of England ].

=== 4th (Dutch) Troop [1689-1699] ===
*1599 raised on 30 April in Holland as a troop of horse and redesignated in 1665 as &quot;Garde du Corps van Zijne Majesteit&quot;, i.e., &quot;His Majesties Life Guards&quot;.
*1689-1699 Placed on English establishment in 1689 and returned to Dutch service in 1699 upon conclusion of the Nine Years&#x27; War and the Treaty of Ryswick. During this period the Dutch troop was ranked as the 4th Troop of Life Guards. In literature this troop is sometimes confused with the Dutch Regiment of Horse Guards, known as Portland&#x27;s Horse after its commander William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland.
*1705 The troop lost its Guards status.
=== 4th (Scots) Troop [1709-1746] ===
*1661-1709 Scots Troop of Horse Guards [raised on the Scottish establishment]
*1709-1746 4th Troop of Horse Guards [transferred to the British establishment]
*1746 absorbed by 2nd Troop, The Horse Guards.

==Other Troops==

=== The Scottish Troop [1661-1676] ===
Raised on the Scottish Establishment for attendance on the Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.

*1661-1663 The Earl of Middleton&#x27;s Troop of Horse Guards
*1664-1676 The Earl of Rothe&#x27;s Troop of Horse Guards

=== The Irish Troop [1662-1685] ===
*1662 raised on the Irish Establishment
*1685 disbanded following the ascent of James II

=== Remarks ===
In some literature reference is made to the existence of a 4th, 5th and 6th Troop of Horse Guards, between 1661 and 1683, 1664 and 1676, and 1664 and 1685, respectively. However, no explicit evidence if found of these troops and it is thought that these 4th, 5th and 6th Troops were confused with the Scots Troop, the (other) Scots Troop for attendance of the Lord High Commissioner, and the Irish Troop.

== Ranks [1766] ==
=== Officers ===
* Captain and Colonel
* First Lieutenant and Lieutenant Colonel
* Second Lieutenant and Lieutenant Colonel
* Guidon and Major

=== Others ===
* Exempt and Captain
* Brigadier or Adjutant and Lieutenant
* Sub-Brigadier and Cornet
* Gentleman

<doc id="1125801" wikidata="Q1810753" url="?curid=1125801" title="Imperial Service Order">
<text>The Imperial Service Order was established by King Edward VII in August 1902. It was awarded on retirement to the administration and clerical staff of the Civil Service throughout the British Empire for long and meritorious service. Normally a person must have served for 25 years to become eligible, but this might be shortened to 16 years for those serving in unhealthy climates abroad. There is one class: Companion. Both men and women are eligible, and recipients of this order are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &#x27;ISO&#x27;.

==History==
The new order was announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, on the day scheduled for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. The coronation was postponed due to the King&#x27;s illness, however, and the statutes of the order were published on 8 August 1902, to coincide with the actual coronation on the following day. The first list of recipients was included in the Birthday Honours list published on the King′s birthday 9 November 1902.

==Insignia==
&quot;The insignia of the order for men&quot; was an eight-pointed silver star, with the top ray obscured by a crown; the golden central medallion bore the cipher of the reigning monarch surrounded by the legend &#x27;For Faithful Service&#x27;. This was suspended on a ribbon of crimson with a blue central stripe.

&quot;The insignia of the order for women&quot; had the same medallion as for men, surrounded by a silver laurel wreath and topped by a crown. This was suspended on a bow of crimson with a blue central stripe.

==Imperial Service Medal==

Civil servants who complete 25 years&#x27; service are eligible for the Imperial Service Medal (ISM) upon retirement. The medal is a silver circular medal bearing the effigy of the reigning monarch on the obverse, and the motif of a man resting after work with the legend &#x27;For Faithful Service&#x27; on the reverse. The ribbon or bow pattern is the same as the Imperial Service Order.

==1993 reforms==
During the 1993 reform of the British honours system the British Government decided to make no new appointments to the Imperial Service Order. The Imperial Service Medal, however, continues to be awarded in recognition of certain individuals who make positive contributions.

==Statutes==
The Order is governed by statutes.

<doc id="1125806" wikidata="Q1594009" url="?curid=1125806" title="Heidelberg, Gauteng">
<text>Heidelberg is a town with 35,500 inhabitants in the Gauteng province of South Africa, some 50 kilometres south-east of Johannesburg, close to the Mpumalanga border. It sits at the eastern end of the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, next to the N3 highway connecting Johannesburg and Durban.

== History ==
The area was once the kraal of the Bakwena, until colonization and the Basotho wars. 

Modern Heidelberg was founded in 1862 as a trading station by a German, Heinrich Julius Ueckermann. A town was laid out around the store and named after Ueckermann&#x27;s alma mater. In 1866, the District of Heidelberg was created from the eastern portion of the Potchefstroom district with its own &quot;landdrost&quot; (magistrate), having been laid out as a churchplace in 1865.
Heidelberg has played an important part in South African history, acting as a capital for the Boer republic during the war with Great Britain under the Triumvirate of Paul Kruger, P.J. Joubert and M.W. Pretorius, from 1880 to 1883. In 1885, the Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered, and the office of the Mining Commissioner was established there. 

Heidelberg developed as a typical rural Victorian town. Many buildings dating back to the period between 1890 and 1910 have been preserved, including the home of A.G. Visser, a well-loved medical doctor and famous Afrikaans poet, which can still be seen situated close to the main road through town. Other historical landmarks in the town includes Visser&#x27;s bust and the Klipkerk. The British built a concentration camp here during the Second Boer War to house Boer women and children; a monument to their memory, and to those of the black women and children who also died during the war, was erected in the main cemetery in the late 1990s by the current ANC-led municipality.

The far right secessionist political organisation (and former paramilitary group) the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) was founded by the late white supremacist and white separatist leader Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche in the Heidelberg suburb of Rensburg. Its headquarters are now in Terre&#x27;Blanche&#x27;s hometown of Ventersdorp.

The &quot;Jo&#x27;burg to Sea&quot; mountain bike stage race starts in Heidelberg. The &quot;Outdoor X&quot; show is held just outside Heidelberg on the Malonjeni Guest Farm.

<text>Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation, along with Walt Disney World Company, Walt Disney Travel Company, and Reedy Creek Improvement District, owns the land in Walt Disney World Resort. These are all wholly owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company.

==History==
Recreacres, Incorporated was incorporated in Delaware in or before 1968 to help buy up property for Walt Disney World Resort, most of which had already been bought by Compass East Corporation, now Walt Disney World Company.

On January 19, 1971, Recreacres, Incorporated changed its name to Buena Vista Land Company, Incorporated.

On September 6, 1973, Buena Vista Land Company, Incorporated changed its name to Buena Vista Communities, Incorporated.

On June 22, 1998, Buena Vista Communities, Incorporated changed its name to Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation.

Harvest Groves, Incorporated was merged into the Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation on September 30, 1999. This company was named Fischer and Howard, Corporation (which was organized July 1, 1976 to consolidate several small farms in the area) until June 22, 1993; the renaming probably happened soon after The Walt Disney Company took control of it.

<doc id="1125808" wikidata="Q1023208" url="?curid=1125808" title="C.D. Olimpia">
<text>Club Deportivo Olimpia is a professional Honduran football club based in Tegucigalpa, Francisco Morazán. The club is the nation&#x27;s most successful team both in the domestic league and in international club competitions.

==History==
Olimpia was founded as a baseball club on June 12, 1912, by Héctor Pineda Ugarte, Carlos Bram, Arturo Bram, Enrique Buk, Santiago Buk, Miguel Sanchez, Samuel Inestrosa Gómez, and Ramón Escobar. In 1917, it also became a football team.

C.D. Olimpia is the most successful football team in Honduras, having won 34 domestic league titles since it was founded in 1912, the latest being the 2021 Apertura tournament. It has also represented the Honduran football association in international club competitions more than any other team by far. They are the only Honduran club that has won the CONCACAF Champions Cup twice, first in 1972 and again in 1988. Olimpia is also the first team to win the Domestic Cup, known as &quot;Copa Presidente,&quot; in 2015.

==Amateur era==
In 1957, C.D. Olimpia won the national championship of Honduras for the first time. They repeated as champions in 1958 and 1959. The national crown was not awarded in 1960, but they won it again in 1961, 1963, and 1964. In 1964–65, the final season of the amateur era, Olimpia claimed a seventh championship, beating Escualo 2–0.

Players like &quot;Furia&quot; Solis, Rolin Castillo, Ricardo &quot;Chendo&quot; Rodriguez were stars during these seasons.

==National League==
The professional National League began in 1965, with Platense winning the first tournament. Olimpia was runner-up, finishing with 26 points to Platense&#x27;s 27. Things were different the following year, as Mario Griffin Cubas was appointed head coach. In the 1966–67 season, he led &quot;Los Leones&quot; to 14 victories in 18 matches, winning the title six points clear of C.D. Marathón (29–23). Olimpia won the title again in 1967–68, again finishing two games clear of Marathón (27–22).

They relinquished the title to Motagua in 1968–69, but in 1969–70 stormed through the league undefeated, winning their third title in four years (43–35 ahead of Motagua). After losing a championship playoff to Motagua in 1970–71, &quot;Los Leones&quot; regained the crown in 1971–72. That championship was the product of the efforts of Rigoberto &#x27;Chula&#x27; Gomez, Jorge Urquía, and Tonin Mendoza.

It would take 6 years for Olimpia to be crowned again. That came in 1977, under the management of Carlos Cruz Carranza. That year, they faced Real España in a championship final. The first match ended in a scoreless draw, but in the second match the old powers prevailed 2–0. Goals were scored by Uruguayan Walter Chávez and René Enamorado.

It was during the 1980s that Olimpia emerged as the dominant team in Honduras, winning five championships in ten years—1982, 1984, 1986, 1987, and 1989–90. Three more championships came in the 1990s—1992–93, 1995–96, and 1996–97. That 1996–97 championship was the final one before the short season was adopted.

==Short tournament==

Olimpia qualified for the playoffs in each of the first two seasons under the new format, but was eliminated each time. They entered the 1998–99 season determined to overcome those defeats (although the 1998–99 season, played from January–May 1998, took on the format of an Apertura, it was officially known as season 1998–99). Olimpia topped the table in the regular season, then beat Platense and Victoria to reach the championship finals. On July 17, Denilson Costa scored the only goal of a two-legged tie with Real Espana, bringing the title home to Olimpia once again.

Olimpia reached the finals of both Apertura 1999 and Clausura 2000, but on each occasion was defeated by Motagua on penalties. In Apertura 2000, however, they were dominant, finishing 10 points clear of Motagua at the top of the regular season table. Edwin Pavón was the manager, and the team was keyed by Danilo Tosello, Wilmer Velásquez and Alex Pineda Chacón. In the postseason, they reached the finals and played out a classic two-legged tie with Platense. In the first leg, played at Platense&#x27;s home stadium in Puerto Cortes, Olimpia came away with a vital 1–0 victory. Alex Pineda Chacón scored the winner in the 85th minute. In the return leg, Rony Morales scored to even the tie for Platense, but Danilo Tosello&#x27;s extra time penalty brought home another championship for &quot;Los Leones&quot;.

The Platense rivalry built, as Platense avenged the loss by beating Olimpia in Clausura 2001. Olimpia answered by winning another title in Apertura 2002, and in thrilling style. With the tie level 2–2 after 180 minutes of action, the championship drifted into extra time. Milton Palacios won the championship for Olimpia by rising above the crowd to head home the winning goal.

Clausura 2004 was the start of a new phase in the already fierce rivalry between Olimpia and C.D. Marathón, as the teams would meet in the finals four consecutive seasons to determine the championship of Honduras. The first round went to Olimpia, which won the title 2–1 on aggregate. Marathón came back to win Apertura 2004 in the same style, but Olimpia answered by winning Clausura 2005 3–2 on aggregate. &quot;Los Leones&quot; won it again in Apertura 2005, overcoming a 2–1 loss at Marathón to win the championship in extra time.

Clausura 2006 completed the most glorious run in Olimpia&#x27;s history; they beat Victoria 4–3 on aggregate to complete their first threepeat (three wins). It was an achievement celebrated wildly as the .

Other titles followed in Clausura 2008 (beating the old rivals Marathón), Clausura 2009 (in extra time over Real Espana), and Clausura 2010 (over Motagua). However, the next era of glory began in Apertura 2011. That was the season that Danilo Tosello, who had played for Olimpia from 1999 to 2007, returned as manager. In Tosello&#x27;s first season as manager, he led them to a convincing 3–0 aggregate victory over Real Espana in the championship round. They repeated as champions in Clausura 2012, beating Marathón 1–0 on aggregate. Then, finally, in Apertura 2012, still under Tosello&#x27;s guidance, Olimpia defeated Victoria 4–0 to complete a second .

Tosello stepped down after the season, but Olimpia&#x27;s run of dominance continued. They won a fourth consecutive championship in Clausura 2013; after losing 1–0 to Real Sociedad in the first leg, they won 2–0 at home to claim the crown.

Olimpia&#x27;s quest for an unprecedented fifth straight crown ended in Apertura 2013, but they did beat Marathón 4–2 on penalties in Clausura 2014 to hoist a fifth title in six years. They also beat Motagua to win Clausura 2015, and Real Sociedad to win Clausura 2016.

==International success==

In 1973, Olimpia won their first CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup by defeating SV Robinhood of Suriname in San Pedro Sula by a score of 1–0 after tying the first leg at zero in Tegucigalpa. Before reaching the final, Olimpia managed to eliminate Mexico&#x27;s Club Toluca. The club won their second CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1988 when they defeated Defence Force in the final match of the tournament. Before that, Olimpia managed to defeat and eliminate Mexican champions Cruz Azul by a score of 2–1 in a historic match that took place in the Estadio Azteca. To this day, Olimpia remains the only Central American club to have defeated a Mexican team in that stadium. In the semi-finals, Olimpia defeated LD Alajuelense in the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto after they tied the home game in Tegucigalpa.

In January 2001, Olimpia beat the Mexican teams of Toluca and Pachuca. The team, managed by Edwin Pavón triumphed over Toluca with a goal from Robert Lima, 3 goals from Denilson Costa, and one from Alex Pineda Chacon. The lineup for that match was: Donaldo González, Gerson Vásquez, Robert Lima, Samuel Caballero, Nerlin Membreño, Christian Santamaría, Arnold Cruz, Danilo Tosello, José Luis Pineda, Alex Pineda, Denilson Costa, Carlos Paez, and Elmer Marín.

In 2017, Olimpia earned the inaugural Scotiabank CONCACAF League title. Olimpia, which lifted its first CONCACAF trophy since the 1988. The Honduran power, however, captured the inaugural SCL title Thursday, overcoming host Santos de Guapiles 4–1 on penalty kicks at Nacional stadium of Costa Rica, after their two-legged final ended 1–1 on aggregate. Both sides won 1–0 on the road.

Michaell Chirinos’ goal in the 21st minute at the Estadio Nacional was the lifeline Olimpia needed in order to lift its first CONCACAF trophy since the 1988 CONCACAF Champions’ Cup. As a result, Olimpia maintained its record of being the only team to compete in the first 10 SCCL editions. They did not qualify for the 2019 SCCL.

==Logos==
For the 2005–06 tournament, the team modified its logo. It is similar to the previous one, it now has 4 stars in the red side. Each star is said to represent 5 Championships. In 2012, the Honduran club Olimpia celebrates 100 years of life. To celebrate the centenary launched a redesigned shield, same as according to the institution symbolizes the winning attitude of its history.

The club&#x27;s barra brava is La Ultra Fiel. La Ultra Fiel particularly has a fierce rivalry with neighboring club Motagua and their barra brava known as &quot;Los Revolucionarios&quot; or short &quot;La Revo&quot;.

==Club rivalries==

===Clásico Nacional===

El Clásico Nacional (The National Classic) is a Honduran National derby played between Olimpia and Marathón. The derby receives the &quot;national&quot; adjective more because of a geographic matter (Olimpia is from Tegucigalpa and Marathón is from San Pedro Sula, the biggest cities of the country) than for a football or rivalry matter. Olimpia won its first national title in September 1928. At that time Olimpia (representing the central zone of the country) won a final series of three matches against Marathón, champion of the northern league. Following this result, a big rivalry began between these two teams.

The Clasico Capitalino (Capital&#x27;s Classic) is played between Olimpia and Motagua Their matches are also known as the Clasico Local (Local Classic). There is a huge rivalry between the clubs and their fans; (&quot;La Ultra Fiel&quot; (of Olimpia) and &quot;La Revo&quot; (of Motagua). Some people claim that this is the real National Derby because Olimpia and Motagua are the first and second Honduran teams with more titles. Additionally, matches between Olimpia and Marathón do not generate the same expectations and polemics as matches between Olimpia and Motagua do.

===Clásico Moderno (Honduras)===

El Clásico Moderno (The Modern Derby) also referred by some as the Clasico Moderno Hondureño is a Honduran football match played at least 4 times a year in the Honduran Liga Nacional and consists of two teams, Olimpia and Real España.

==Reserve team==
Olimpia has a reserve team named Olimpia Reservas that currently plays in Liga de Ascenso de Honduras. This is where young players can improve their skills before they can be ready to play in the top division. Like all the other reserves teams in Liga de Ascenso, Olimpia Reservas can&#x27;t be promoted to the higher level even if they win the championship.

<text>Fascist symbolism is the use of certain images and symbols which are designed to represent aspects of fascism. These include national symbols of historical importance, goals, and political policies. The best-known are the fasces, which was the original symbol of fascism, and the swastika of Nazism.

==Common symbols of fascist movements==
Organized fascist movements have militarist-appearing uniforms for their members; use historical national symbols as symbols of their movement; and use orchestrated rallies for propaganda purposes. Fascist movements are led by a &quot;Leader&quot; (e.g. &quot;Duce&quot;, &quot;Führer&quot;, &quot;Caudillo&quot;) who is publicly idolized in propaganda as the nation&#x27;s saviour. A number of fascist movements use a straight-armed salute.

The use of symbols, graphics, and other artifacts created by fascist, authoritarian, and totalitarian governments has been noted as a key aspect of their propaganda. Most fascist movements adopted symbols of Ancient Roman or Greek origin, for example, the German use of Roman standards during rallies and the Italian adoption of the &quot;fasces&quot; symbol. The Spanish Falange took its name from the Spanish word for the Greek phalanx.

==Militarist uniforms with nationalist insignia==
Organized fascist movements typically use military-like uniforms with the symbol of their movement on them.

In Italy, the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 wore black military-like uniforms and was nicknamed Blackshirts. In power, uniforms during the Fascist era extended to both the party and the military which typically bore &quot;fasces&quot; or an eagle clutching a fasces on their caps or on the left arm section of the uniform.

In Germany, the fascist Nazi movement was similar to the Italian Fascists in that they initially used a specifically colored uniform for their movement, the tan-brown colored uniform of the SA paramilitary group earned the group and the Nazis themselves the nickname of the Brownshirts. The Nazis used the swastika for their uniforms and copied the Italian Fascists&#x27; uniforms, with an eagle clutching a wreathed swastika instead of a fasces, and a Nazi flag arm sash on the left arm section of the uniform for party members.

Other fascist countries largely copied the symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist-type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark blue shirts for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore blue shirts. Berets were also used, representing their Carlist supporters. The Spanish Blue Division expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WWII in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore blue shirts, berets and their army trousers.

==Fascist use of heraldry==

Fascist governments often saw the need to change the heraldry of their nations; in Germany, the arms of Coburg, featuring the head of Saint Maurice, was looked down upon for its religious and un-Aryan nature. It was replaced in 1934 with a coat of arms featuring a sword and swastika. Thuringia also saw the need to support the Nazi regime by adding a swastika to the paws of the lion on its coat of arms. In Italy, the chief of a coat of arms is often used to indicate political allegiance. Under the government of Mussolini, many families and locales adopted a red chief charged with a fasces to indicate allegiance to the National Fascist Party; this chief was called the &quot;capo del littorio&quot;. Francisco Franco, Chief of State of Francoist Spain, used a personal coat of arms featuring the Royal Bend of Castile, a heraldic symbol used by the Crown of Castile.

==Italy==

The original symbol of fascism in Italy under Benito Mussolini was the fasces. This is an ancient Imperial Roman symbol of power carried by lictors in front of magistrates; a bundle of sticks featuring an axe, indicating the power over life and death. Before the Italian Fascists adopted the fasces, the symbol had been used by Italian political organizations of various political ideologies, called &quot;Fasci&quot; (&quot;leagues&quot;) as a symbol of strength through unity.

Italian Fascism utilized the color black as a symbol of their movement, black being the color of the uniforms of their paramilitaries, known as Blackshirts. The blackshirt derived from Italy&#x27;s daredevil elite shock troops known as the &quot;Arditi&quot;, soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms. The colour black, as used by the Arditi, symbolized death.

Other symbols used by the Italian Fascists included the &quot;aquila&quot;, the Capitoline Wolf, and the SPQR motto, each related to Italy&#x27;s ancient Roman cultural history, which the Fascists attempted to resurrect.

==Germany==
The nature of German fascism, as encapsulated in Nazism, was similar to Italian Fascism ideologically and borrowed symbolism from the Italian Fascists such as the use of mass rallies, the straight-armed Roman salute, and the use of pageantry. Nazism was different from Italian Fascism in that it was officially racist. Its symbol was the swastika, at the time a commonly seen symbol in the world that had experienced a revival in use in the western world in the early 20th century. German völkisch Nationalists claimed the swastika was a symbol of the Aryan race, who they claimed were the foundation of Germanic civilization and were superior to all other races.

As the Italian Fascists adapted elements of their ethnic heritage to fuel a sense of Nationalism by use of symbolism, so did Nazi Germany. Turn-of-the-century German-Austrian mystic and author Guido von List was a big influence on Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, who introduced various ancient Germanic symbols (filtered through von List&#x27;s writings) more thoroughly into the SS, including the stylized double Sig Rune (von List&#x27;s then-contemporary Armanen rune version of the ancient &quot;sowilo&quot; rune) for the organization itself.

The black-white-red tricolor of the German Empire was utilized as the color scheme of the Nazi flag. The color brown was the identifying color of Nazism (and fascism in general), due to its being the color of the SA paramilitaries (also known as Brownshirts).

Other historical symbols that were already in use by the German Army to varying degrees prior to the Nazi Germany, such as the Wolfsangel and Totenkopf, were also used in a new, more industrialized manner on uniforms and insignia.

Although the swastika was a popular symbol in art prior to the regimental use by Nazi Germany and has a long heritage in many other cultures throughout history - and although many of the symbols used by the Nazis were ancient or commonly used prior to the advent of Nazi Germany - because of association with Nazi use, the swastika is often considered synonymous with Nazism and some of the other symbols still carry a negative post-World War II stigma in Western countries, to the point where some of the symbols are banned from display altogether.

==Spain==
The fascist Falange in Spain utilized the yoke and arrows as their symbol. It historically served as the symbol of the shield of the monarchy of Ferdinand and Isabella and subsequent Catholic monarchs, representing a united Spain and the &quot;symbol of the heroic virtues of the race&quot;. The original uniform of the &quot;Falangistas&quot; was the blue shirt – derived from the blue overalls of industrial workers – which was later combined with the red beret of the Carlists to represent their merger by Franco.

==Poland==
Several Polish far-right and nationalist organizations have used the &quot;falanga sword&quot;, most notably by the ONR and NOP as their main identifying symbols.

==Other places==



Many other fascist movements did not win power or were relatively minor regimes in comparison and their symbolism is not well-remembered today in many parts of the world, although the BUF&#x27;s Flash and Circle was later used by the non-fascist People&#x27;s Action Party of Singapore.

In alphabetical order by nation:

* Austria&#x27;s Fatherland&#x27;s Front, that ruled the country from 1933 to 1938, used the crutch cross as its symbol.
* Lightning bolts were a common symbol of Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, appearing on uniforms, newspaper mastheads, badges and on the movement&#x27;s flags. The symbol completely replaced the fasces used from 1932 to 1935 with the adoption of the Flash and Circle.
* The Brazilian Integralist Action used an upper case sigma (Σ), to represent the summation of all things under the State.
* The symbol of the Bulgarian national-socialist Ratnik movements was a sun cross named &quot;Bogar&quot;.
* The symbol of the Croatian Ustaše movement was capital letter U with the flaming grenade and the Croatian coat of arms.
* A prominent symbol of the Greek 4th of August Regime was the Labrys/Pelekys, the double-headed axe which Ioannis Metaxas thought to be the oldest symbol of all Hellenic civilizations.
* Greece&#x27;s far-right, ultra-nationalist Golden Dawn Party uses a flag depicting a meandros in a style and color scheme reminiscent of the Nazi swastika.
* The symbol of Hungary&#x27;s fascistic Arrow Cross Party was the Arrow Cross.
* The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) used the Wolfsangel as its main symbol.
* The symbol of the Norwegian Nasjonal Samling was as golden/yellow sun cross on red background.
* The symbol of Salazar&#x27;s Portuguese Estado Novo regime was a stylized version of the Christ Cross and shield found on the national flag to distinguish its rivals in the Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista used the Order of Christ Cross.
* The symbol of the Romanian Iron Guard was a triple cross (a variant of the triple parted and fretted) – three parallel verticals intersected with three parallel horizontals, usually in black; it was meant to represent prison bars, as a badge of martyrdom. It was sometimes deemed the &quot;Archangel Michael Cross&quot;, after the patron saint of the movement.
* The symbol of the Silver Legion of America was a silver flag with a scarlet letter L.
* The Russian Movement Against Illegal Immigration used the black-colored road sign &quot;Stop Prohibited&quot; (similar to the swastika) as their main symbol.
* The quasi-Fascist Yugoslav ZBOR used a green shield with a blade of wheat on it, with a sword crossing the shield.

==Contemporary usage==
Some neo-Nazi organizations continue to use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some neo-fascist groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke nationalistic sentiment but do not carry the same racist connotations. The use of fascist symbols is subject to legal restrictions in many countries.

<text>The 1st (His Majesty&#x27;s Own) Troop of Horse Guards was formed from King Charles II&#x27;s exiled followers in the Netherlands (the Stuart monarchs had been overthrown during the English Civil War, and replaced with the Commonwealth).

The regiment was formed in 1658, and placed on the English establishment three years later, with the official formation of the &quot;modern&quot; British Army. It fought at Dettingen, along with four other troops of the Royal Horse Guards, and eventually absorbed the 3rd Troop of Horse Guards and the 1st Troop, Horse Grenadier Guards. On 25 June 1788, the regiment became the 1st Regiment of Life Guards.

<text>Milton Alexánder Reyes Galeas (born 2 May 1974) is a retired Honduran football player, who played for primarily F.C. Motagua.

==Club career==
Nicknamed &quot;Jocón&quot;, Reyes began playing professional football as a central defender with Yoro FC of the Honduran second division in 1993. He moved to then newly promoted Independiente Villela, for whom he made his debut in the Honduran National League on 24 September 1995 against Vida. He subsequently moved to Motagua, one of Honduras&#x27;s most prestigious clubs, where he would play from 1997 to 2002, helping the club to five championships.

===Major League Soccer===
In 2002, he moved to Major League Soccer, where he signed a contract with D.C. United. Reyes immediately impressed with his offensive forays from the right back position, and ended the season with 24 starts and two assists to his credit. Unfortunately, Reyes tore his ACL in the 2003 preseason, and was forced to miss all of the 2003 season.

Upon his return, Reyes was cut by D.C. United for salary cap reasons, and after considering a return to Honduras, decided to stay in MLS and sign with the Dallas Burn. Although Reyes initially did not impress in Dallas, as he regained his old form his attacking abilities shone through, and he ended the season at Dallas starting both at the left midfield and left back positions for the team, ending the season with 828 minutes in nine starts. Reyes left the team after the season.

===Back at Motagua===
He came back to Motagua in 2005. Reyes announced his retirement after finishing the 2008 Clausura tournament but was persuaded to stay with the club until 2011. He retired after the &quot;clasico&quot; against Olimpia on 30 October 2011.

===Domestic goals summary===
==International career==
Reyes made his debut for Honduras in a March 1999 UNCAF Nations Cup match against Belize and has earned a total of 41 caps, scoring no goals. He has represented his country in 17 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 1999 and 2005 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He also appeared in the first match when Honduras took third place at the 2001 Copa América.

His final international was an October 2006 friendly match against Guatemala.

==Personal life==
Milton Reyes has three kids.

<doc id="1125860" wikidata="Q739129" url="?curid=1125860" title="Shūji Terayama">
<text>was a Japanese avant-garde poet, artist, dramatist, writer, film director, and photographer. His works range from radio drama, experimental television, underground (&quot;Angura&quot;) theatre, countercultural essays, to Japanese New Wave and &quot;expanded&quot; cinema.

Many critics view him as one of the most productive and provocative creative artists to come out of Japan. He has been cited as an influence on various Japanese filmmakers from the 1970s onward.

==Life==
Terayama was born December 10, 1935, in Hirosaki, Aomori, the only son of Hachiro and Hatsu Terayama. When Terayama was nine, his mother moved to Kyūshū to work at an American military base, while he himself went to live with relatives in the city of Misawa, also in Aomori. Terayama lived through the Aomori air raids that killed more than 30,000 people. His father died at the end of the Pacific War in Indonesia in September 1945.

Terayama entered Aomori High School in 1951 and, in 1954, he enrolled in Waseda University&#x27;s Faculty of Education to study Japanese language and literature. However, he soon dropped out because he fell ill with nephrotic syndrome. He received his education through working in bars in Shinjuku. By 18, he was the second winner of the Tanka Studies Award.

He married Kyōko Kujō () on April 2, 1963: they would later co-found the Tenjō Sajiki theatre troupe. Kujō later began an extramarital affair with fellow co-founder Yutaka Higashi. She and Terayama formally divorced in December 1970, although they continued to work together until Terayama&#x27;s death on May 4, 1983, from cirrhosis of the liver. Kujō died on April 30, 2014.

== Career ==
His oeuvre includes a number of essays claiming that more can be learned about life through boxing and horse racing than by attending school and studying hard. Accordingly, he was one of the central figures of the &quot;runaway&quot; movement in Japan in the late 1960s, as depicted in his book, play, and film &quot;Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets!&quot; (). 

In 1967, Terayama formed the Tenjō Sajiki theater troupe, whose name comes from the Japanese translation of the 1945 Marcel Carné film &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; and literally translates to &quot;ceiling gallery&quot; (with a meaning similar to the English term &quot;peanut gallery&quot;). The troupe was dedicated to the avant-garde and staged a number of controversial plays tackling social issues from an iconoclastic perspective in unconventional venues, such the streets of Tokyo or private homes. Some major plays include &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (), &quot;Yes&quot; (), and &quot;The Crime of Fatso Oyama&quot; (). 

Many influential artists were frequent collaborators or members of Tenjō Sajiki. Artists Aquirax Uno and Tadanori Yokoo designed many of the advertisement posters for the group. Musically, Terayama worked closely with experimental composer J.A. Seazer and folk musician Kan Mikami. Fellow Waseda University alumnus Kohei Ando collaborated with Terayama as a Production Assistant. Sci-fi author Izumi Suzuki acted in Tenjō Sajiki productions, and the troupe staged some of Suzuki&#x27;s own plays. Playwright Rio Kishida was also part of the company. She viewed Terayama as a mentor, and together they collaborated on &quot;Shintokumaru&quot; (&quot;Poison Boy&quot;), &quot;The Audience Seats&quot;, and &quot;Lemmings&quot;.

Terayama experimented with &#x27;city plays&#x27;, a fantastical satire of civic life. 
Also in 1967, Terayama started an experimental cinema and gallery called &#x27;Universal Gravitation,&#x27; which is still in existence at Misawa as a resource center. The Terayama Shūji Memorial Hall, which has a large collection of his plays, novels, poetry, photography and a great number of his personal effects and relics from his theatre productions, can also be found in Misawa. 

With the Tenjo Sajiki Troupe, Terayama directed two plays at the Shiraz Arts Festival, &quot;Origin of Blood&quot;, in 1973 and &quot;Ship of Folly&quot;, in 1976. In 1976, he was a member of the jury at the 26th Berlin International Film Festival.

== Legacy ==
In 1997, the Shuji Terayama Museum was opened in Misawa, Aomori, with personal items donated by his mother, Hatsu. The museum was designed by visual artist Kiyoshi Awazu, who had previously collaborated with Terayama. As of 2015, the museum&#x27;s director is poet Eimei Sasaki, who had previously starred in &quot;Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets&quot; (1968).

Asahi Shimbun named an award after Terayama with the inauguration of their Asahi Performing Arts Awards in 2001. &quot;The Terayama Shūji Prize is meant to recognize artistic innovation by individuals or organizations who have demonstrated artistic innovation&quot;. However, the awards were suspended in 2008.

Terayama wrote lyrics to many songs that became generational hits, including Maki Asakawa&#x27;s &quot;Kamome&quot; (Seagull) and Carmen Maki&#x27;s &quot;Toki ni wa haha no nai ko no you ni&quot; (Sometimes like a motherless child). 

In March 2012, Tate Modern in London hosted a tribute to Terayama that was attended by Kyōko Kujō and Terayama&#x27;s assistant director, Henrikku Morisaki.

<text>The Farmington River is a river located in northwest Connecticut, with major tributaries extending into southwest Massachusetts.&gt; The Farmington River&#x27;s watershed covers . Historically, the river played an important role in small-scale manufacturing in towns along its course, but it is now mainly used for recreation and drinking water.

== Geography ==
The headwaters of the Farmington River are comprised of the East and West Branches. 

The West Branch begins at the outlet of Hayden Pond in Otis, Massachusetts, while the East Branch begins in Hartland, Connecticut, at the confluence of Pond, Hubbard and Valley Brooks. The longest route of the river, from the origin of its West Branch, is long, making the Farmington River the Connecticut River&#x27;s longest tributary by over the Westfield River directly to its north.

The East Branch has been impounded along the first 11 miles of its course by the Saville Dam to create the Barkhamsted Reservoir and Lake McDonough, exiting the latter in New Hartford, Connecticut, and joining the West Branch one mile south of the lake. Upper reaches of the river generally flow southward, but the river turns northward in Farmington, Connecticut, and runs mostly north and east until it flows into the Connecticut River in Windsor, Connecticut.

== History ==
Sites built adjacent to the river by nomadic peoples at the end of the last Ice Age, 12,400 years BP of the Younger Dryas indicate the presence of the earliest peoples to populate the region that would become known as southern New England. In the winter of 2019, the remains of the site were excavated in Avon, along with stone tools and artifacts constructed from materials in neighboring regions.

The upper Connecticut and Farmington River valleys were the lands of the Native American indigenous people called the Massaco, a sub-tribe of the Tunxis, who were affiliated with the Wappinger. The name Tunxis, a word in the Quiripi family of Eastern Algonquian languages, derives from the indigenous term &quot;Wuttunkshau&quot; for &quot;the point where the river bends&quot;. Halfway through the course of the river, in a floodplain in the town of Farmington at the base of the Metacomet Ridge, the flow of the Farmington River changes its direction to the northeast, where it eventually joins up with the Connecticut River in Windsor.

When Europeans first arrived, the &quot;Tunxis Sepus&quot; territory consisted of a 165-mile square area bounded by Simsbury to the North, Wallingford to the South, to the northwest by Mohawk country, and on the east by the current towns of Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield. In 1645, the Town of Farmington, Connecticut was named by the Connecticut General Assembly, and this was re-affirmed in 1650 by the execution of a deed by the General Assembly and the reservation of land for the &quot;Tunxis Indians&quot; near &quot;Indian Neck&quot; on the east bank of the Farmington River. A group of twenty wigwams existed in Farmington at the beginning of the eighteenth century, but only four or five families resided in the settlement by 1761

The land of the Massaco was subsequently purchased by the Dutch. This and its settlement during the era of the Connecticut Colony are described in the early history of Simsbury.

The Spoonville Dam, built on the Farmington River in 1899 below the Tariffville Gorge in East Granby, was breached in the Flood of 1955 and remained as a partial dam for several decades before being removed in July 2012. The dam, as well as the bridge crossing the Farmington River downstream at Route 187, derived its name from the silver plating factory erected in 1840 on the north bank of the river. It was the first factory of its kind in the United States.

=== Historical crossings ===
Several bridges constructed in the 19th century and early 20th century still span the Farmington River to this day. Among these are:
* Farmington River Railroad Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Windsor, Connecticut built in 1867

* Drake Hill Road Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Simsbury, Connecticut constructed in 1892
* Town Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Canton, Connecticut constructed by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company in 1895
* Richards Corner Bridge, a Pratt through-truss bridge in New Hartford, Connecticut built in 1930 which spans the East Branch Farmington River
* Pleasant Valley Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Barkhamsted, Connecticut built in 1939
* Unionville Bridge, a Warren through-truss bridge in Unionville, Connecticut built in 1939

== Recreation ==

=== Fishing ===
The Farmington River is among Connecticut&#x27;s most heavily stocked trout streams, with over 50,000 brook, brown, rainbow and tiger trout planted in 2022 throughout the West Branch and main stem. It also hosts a robust population of wild, stream-born trout, which have been found to account for roughly 40% of the river&#x27;s trout population. The West Branch, in particular, has developed a reputation as one of the best trout streams in the Northeastern United States, owing largely to being a bottom-release tailwater which remains cold, well-oxygenated and especially conducive to sustaining coldwater fish species year-round. The unique &quot;Survivor Strain&quot; brown trout, selectively bred at state hatcheries to be supremely adapted to Connecticut&#x27;s waters, relies on annual collections of high-quality wild and holdover trout from the West Branch. 

=== Boating ===
The river has several whitewater sections that are popular for tubing and kayaking. One of these, the colloquial &quot;Upper Farmington&quot; section of the West Branch in New Boston, Massachusetts, is about long. It is Class 2 through farm and woods scenery to an iron bridge, where kayak and canoe slalom races are held. A second whitewater section is found in Tariffville, Connecticut, consisting of of technical Class 2 and Class 3 water with heavy currents. Other whitewater areas include Satan&#x27;s Kingdom in New Hartford, Connecticut, which is also popular with tubers, and the Crystal Rapids section in Collinsville and Unionville, Connecticut, which offers of Class 2 waters.

== Dams and power generation ==
The west branch of the river includes hydroelectric dams in West Hartland and Colebrook, run by the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut.

The largest dam on the east branch is the Saville Dam, which impounds the Barkhamsted Reservoir.

The Rainbow Dam, a dam with a hydroelectric generator and a fish ladder, dams the river at Windsor, a few miles before the river flows into the Connecticut River.

A number of other dams have been built on the river since European settlement, usually to power mills and other industry. A few, such as in Collinsville, are still mostly intact. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act (H.R. 316;113th Congress) would instruct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut, to restart two small power dams along the river. The bill passed the United States House of Representatives on February 12, 2013, but has not yet become law.

Water released from or flowing over the Otis Reservoir dam enters the Farmington River just north of Reservoir Road in Otis, Massachusetts. Significant quantities of water are released during the fall in order to drop the reservoir water level for the winter.

== Natural resources and conservation ==
Much of the Farmington River has been designated as part of the United States National Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers System. The first such designation on the river was bestowed in 1994 and included 14 miles of water, mostly along the Farmington River West Branch but also a section of the river&#x27;s main stem, from Hartland to the New Hartford-Canton town line. In 2019, this designation was extended 1.1 miles further downstream to the confluence with the Nepaug River. Most of the Farmington River main stem and the Salmon Brook tributary system, totalling 61.7 miles of additional water, were also designated Wild &amp; Scenic in 2019. The Farmington River Coordinating Committee oversees the implementation of management plans for the designated runs of the Farmington River and includes representatives from towns along the river, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Metropolitan District Commission, National Park Service, Farmington River Watershed Association and Farmington River Anglers Association.

The Farmington River and its tributaries are known to contain 11 species of freshwater mussels. The Farmington has the highest mussel species diversity of any tributary to the Connecticut, lacking only the Yellow lampmussel, which is found only in the mainstem of the Connecticut from Turners Falls, MA downriver to Windsor, CT.

<text>Lars Fredrik Jansson (8 October 1926, Helsinki – 31 July 2000, Helsinki) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish author and cartoonist.

== Early life ==
A native of Helsinki, Jansson was the son of a sculptor, Viktor Jansson, and a Swedish-born illustrator, Signe Hammarsten-Jansson. His siblings included an older sister, writer Tove Jansson, and an older brother, photographer Per Olov Jansson. In 1957, he began working with his sister on the writing of the &quot;Moomin&quot; comic strip, which he produced single-handedly from 1960 to 1975. Between 1990 and 1992, Jansson worked with Dennis Livson to develop the concept of the &quot;Moomin&quot; animated series in Japan. His daughter, Sophia, worked together with him in 1993 to help manage the production of a new series of Moomin strips which Sophia now manages solely.

<text>Mona Hatoum (; born 1952) is a British-Palestinian multimedia and installation artist who lives in London.

==Biography==
Mona Hatoum was born in 1952 in Beirut, Lebanon, to Palestinian parents. Although born in Lebanon, Hatoum was ineligible for a Lebanese identity card and does not identify as Lebanese. As she grew up, her family did not support her desire to pursue art. She continued to draw throughout her childhood, though, illustrating her work from poetry and science classes.

Hatoum studied graphic design at Beirut University College in Lebanon for two years and then began working at an advertising agency. Hatoum was displeased with the advertising work she produced. During a visit to London in 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out and Hatoum was forced into exile.

She stayed in London, training at both the Byam Shaw School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art (University College, London) between the years 1975 and 1981. In the years since, &quot;she has traveled extensively and developed a dynamic art practice that explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity, and being an outsider.&quot;

==Artwork and themes==
Hatoum explores a variety of different subject matter via different theoretical frameworks. Her work can be interpreted as a description of the body, as a commentary on politics, and on gender and difference as she explores the dangers and confines of the domestic world. Her work can also be interpreted through the concept of space as her sculpture and installation work depend on the viewer to inhabit the surrounding space to complete the effect. There are always multiple readings to her work. The physical responses that Hatoum desired to provoke psychological and emotional responses ensures unique and individual reactions from different viewers.

===Early work===
Hatoum&#x27;s early work consisted largely of performance pieces that used a direct physical confrontation with an audience to make a political point. She used this technique as a means of making a direct statement using her own body; the performances often referenced her background and the political situation in Palestine. In her work, she addressed the vulnerability of the individual in relation to the violence inherent in institutional power structures. Her primary point of reference was the human body, sometimes using her own body.

One such example was in her 1985 work, &quot;Roadworks&quot;, in which Hatoum walked barefoot through the streets of Brixton, with black boots tied behind her ankles, a statement on the surveillance and policing of the predominantly-Afro-Caribbean population after the 1981 Brixton riot/uprising and the 1985 Brixton riot/uprising. About this work, she writes: ‘I found myself in this rare situation of creating work which although personal/autobiographical, had an immediate relevance to the community of people it was addressing. I also found that I was working ‘for’ the people in the streets of Brixton rather than ‘against’ the indifferent, often hostile audience I usually encounter.’ &quot;Roadworks&quot; was curated as part of the 2023 Women in Revolt Exhibition at Tate Modern. 

===&quot;Measures of Distance&quot;===
Created in 1988 as a result of a residency at Western Front in Vancouver, &quot;Measures of Distance&quot; illustrates Hatoum&#x27;s early themes of family, displacement, and female sexuality. The video piece itself is fifteen minutes long and consists of intimate, colored photographs of Hatoum&#x27;s mother showering. Hatoum overlays the photographs with letters that her mother, living in Beirut during the civil war, wrote to Hatoum, living in London. Handwritten in Arabic, the letters make up the video&#x27;s narration and themes, and speak to the difficulty of sending letters in a time of conflict. Hatoum reads the letters aloud in Arabic and English. The video roots itself in the brief family reunion that occurred in Beirut between Hatoum and her parents in 1981. While primarily about the mother–daughter relationship, in her mother&#x27;s letters Hatoum&#x27;s father is mentioned and thus the father–daughter relationship as well as the husband–wife relationship is examined in this video.

The elements of the video—the letters, Hatoum&#x27;s mother&#x27;s wish to see her, and mentions of the war by Hatoum&#x27;s mother—explore how the war in Palestine and the war in Lebanon displaced the identity and the relationships of Hatoum and her family. The video is neither a documentary nor meant to be journalistic. The video critiques stereotypes and remains optimistic, since the narration from the letters is largely positive, except about the distance between the mother and the daughter. Hatoum attempts to recreate the moments when she reunited with her mother in Beirut and when she asked to photograph her in the shower. Instead of directly depicting the Israeli–Palestinian conflict or the Lebanese Civil War, Hatoum shows how the conflicts affected her family&#x27;s relationships and her identity. Hatoum both distances and draws in Western audiences through her narration in English and Arabic.

In this portrait of a Palestinian woman, Hatoum gives her mother a voice while subverting stereotypes about Arab women. The Tate Modern describes the portrait in the following words: &quot;It is through the daughter&#x27;s art-making project that the mother is able to present herself freely, in a form which cements a bond of identity independent of colonial and patriarchal concerns.&quot; &quot;Measures of Distance&quot; is one of the few works done by Hatoum that speaks directly to her background. In other works, Hatoum prefers to be more abstract and to leave the work open ended. While not as abstract as many of her other works, the viewer is still forced to work through how to understand the formal elements of the video. They are not easily given by Hatoum, as the narration is here. &quot;The video transmits the &#x27;paradoxical state of geographical distance and emotional closeness.&#x27;&quot; It underscores her sense of exile and separation caused by war.

&quot;Measures of Distance&quot; was screened at the London Film Festival, AFI National Video Festival, and the Montreal Women&#x27;s Film and Video Festival.

=== &quot;Grater Divide&quot; ===
Made in 2002, &quot;Grater Divide&quot; transforms an everyday object, in this case a common kitchen grater, into a divider, alluding to political alienation, perhaps caused by Israeli-built walls in Palestinian territory.

===&quot;Hot Spot III&quot;===
&quot;Hot Spot III&quot;, created in 2009, is a large installation piece of the globe tilted like the Earth and about as tall as a person. The title connects to the theme of political unrest, imagining conflict in one geographical area upsetting the whole world. The globe is made of cage-like steel that glows luminescent red, as though the world is ablaze, flickering quickly, meant to create an energetic environment that mesmerizes the audience. The installation also invokes a feeling of danger with the hot red lighting outlining the continents. Hatoum challenges whether minimalist or surrealist forms can adequately address the world&#x27;s issues.

===Later work===

In the late 1980s, Hatoum abandoned performances as politically too direct and instead turned her attention to installations and objects, taking up some of the earlier ideas from her student days at the Slade School of Art in London. From then on, she relied on the kind of interactivity that lets the spectator become involved in the aesthetic experience without making the artist as performer the focus of attention.

Since the 1990s, her work has generally shifted from making statements to asking questions. Much more is required of the viewer as performances were replaced by sculptures and installations that required a level of mental and physical interactivity. Her practice has shifted towards site specificity in, for instance, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and Kunsthalle Hamburg.

A notable piece exemplifying her turn from performance to physical objects is &quot;Keffieh&quot; (1993–1999), a scarf woven of human hair that juxtaposes ideas of femininity and religion.

At the end of the 1980s, she began to focus on common domestic objects—including kitchen utensils and house furnishings. T42 (1993–98) is a pair of teacups fused together at the rim.

===The body===
Many of Hatoum&#x27;s early pieces situate the body as the locus of a network of concerns—political, feminist, and linguistic—thereby eliciting a highly visceral response. One of her pieces, a 1994 video installation called &quot;Corps etranger&quot;, showed color video images of an endoscopic probe of her body. Corps &quot;etranger&quot; was originally produced for Centre Georges Pompidou and features a partially enclosed, cylindrical structure that viewers are called to enter. The viewer stands on a circular plate of glass, and video close-up images of internal and external parts of the artist&#x27;s body. The artist hails the viewer to &quot;walk around&quot; the inside of her body through the visual sequence taken on the endoscope and colonoscope, scanning and probing her digestive system. The audio is a recording of a heartbeat and bodily movements.

The artwork of Hatoum investigates the concept of the &#x27;abjection&#x27; introduced by the cultural theorist, Julia Kristeva and the uncanny in her works using body hair.

===Politics===
The political possibilities for the uncanny visual motif are relevant to discussions of Hatoum&#x27;s work, as the disruption achieved at a psychological level can have broad implications involving power, politics, or individual concerns. The allusiveness attained by her work is not always referencing grand political events, or appealing to a generalized cultural consciousness, but instead to a seemingly unattainable threat that is only possible to address on an individual scale.

Hatoum has tied her works to other political movements, especially black struggle. In an interview with Michael Archer in 1997, Hatoum said: &quot;At the beginning it was important to think about the black struggle as a total political struggle. There are common political forces and attitudes that discriminate against people. In the same way as feminism started off with this totalizing concept of &#x27;sisterhood&#x27;, and then we ended up with many feminisms, if you like. The black struggle became more diversified once the basic issues were established. And blackness here is not to do with the colour of your skin but a political stance.&quot;

==Exhibitions==
Hatoum&#x27;s work was featured in a solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2015. In May 2016, Tate Modern held a &quot;comprehensive exploration into 35 years of Hatoum&#x27;s work in Britain, from her early performance and video works to her sculpture and large-scale installation&quot; The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas organized a solo exhibition titled &quot;Mona Hatoum: Terra Infirma&quot; that was on view from 12 October 2017 to 25 February 2018. This exhibition then traveled to the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and was on view from 6 April to 11 August 2018.

In March 2018, Hatoum was shortlisted for the Hepworth Prize for Sculpture, alongside Michael Dean, Phillip Lai, Magali Reus and Cerith Wyn Evans. In January 2020, Hatoum was part of Artpace’s exhibit titled &quot;Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace&quot;. Also in 2020, she received the Julio González award, featuring in a solo exhibition at Institut Valencià d&#x27;Art Modern in 2021.

<doc id="1125883" wikidata="Q176789" url="?curid=1125883" title="Markov decision process">
<text>Markov decision process (MDP), also called a stochastic dynamic program or stochastic control problem, is a model for sequential decision making when outcomes are uncertain.

Originating from operations research in the 1950s, MDPs have since gained recognition in a variety of fields, including ecology, economics, healthcare, telecommunications and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning utilizes the MDP framework to model the interaction between a learning agent and its environment. In this framework, the interaction is characterized by states, actions, and rewards. The MDP framework is designed to provide a simplified representation of key elements of artificial intelligence challenges. These elements encompass the understanding of cause and effect, the management of uncertainty and nondeterminism, and the pursuit of explicit goals.

The name comes from its connection to Markov chains, a concept developed by the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov. The &quot;Markov&quot; in &quot;Markov decision process&quot; refers to the underlying structure of state transitions that still follow the Markov property. The process is called a &quot;decision process&quot; because it involves making decisions that influence these state transitions, extending the concept of a Markov chain into the realm of decision-making under uncertainty.

==Definition==

A Markov decision process is a 4-tuple formula_1, where:

* formula_2 is a set of states called the &quot;&lt;dfn&gt;state space&lt;/dfn&gt;&quot;. The state space may be discrete or continuous, like the set of real numbers.
* formula_3 is a set of actions called the &quot;&lt;dfn&gt;action space&lt;/dfn&gt;&quot; (alternatively, formula_4 is the set of actions available from state formula_5). As for state, this set may be discrete or continuous.
* formula_6 is, on an intuitive level, the probability that action formula_7 in state formula_5 at time formula_9 will lead to state formula_10 at time formula_11. In general, this probability transition is defined to satisfy formula_12 for every formula_13 measurable. In case the state space is discrete, the integral is intended with respect to the counting measure, so that the latter simplifies as formula_14; In case formula_15, the integral is usually intended with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
*formula_16 is the immediate reward (or expected immediate reward) received after transitioning from state formula_5 to state formula_10, due to action formula_7.

A policy function formula_20 is a (potentially probabilistic) mapping from state space (formula_2) to action space (formula_3).

===Optimization objective===

The goal in a Markov decision process is to find a good &quot;policy&quot; for the decision maker: a function formula_20 that specifies the action formula_24 that the decision maker will choose when in state formula_5. Once a Markov decision process is combined with a policy in this way, this fixes the action for each state and the resulting combination behaves like a Markov chain (since the action chosen in state formula_5 is completely determined by formula_24).

The objective is to choose a policy formula_20 that will maximize some cumulative function of the random rewards, typically the expected discounted sum over a potentially infinite horizon:

:formula_29 (where we choose formula_30, i.e. actions given by the policy). And the expectation is taken over formula_31

where formula_32 is the discount factor satisfying formula_33, which is usually close to formula_34 (for example, formula_35 for some discount rate formula_36). A lower discount factor motivates the decision maker to favor taking actions early, rather than postpone them indefinitely.

Another possible, but strictly related, objective that is commonly used is the formula_37step return. This time, instead of using a discount factor formula_32, the agent is interested only in the first formula_39 steps of the process, with each reward having the same weight.

:formula_40 (where we choose formula_30, i.e. actions given by the policy). And the expectation is taken over formula_31

where formula_43 is the time horizon. Compared to the previous objective, the latter one is more used in Learning Theory.

A policy that maximizes the function above is called an &quot;&lt;dfn&gt;optimal policy&lt;/dfn&gt;&quot; and is usually denoted formula_44. A particular MDP may have multiple distinct optimal policies. Because of the Markov property, it can be shown that the optimal policy is a function of the current state, as assumed above.

===Simulator models===

In many cases, it is difficult to represent the transition probability distributions, formula_6, explicitly. In such cases, a simulator can be used to model the MDP implicitly by providing samples from the transition distributions. One common form of implicit MDP model is an episodic environment simulator that can be started from an initial state and yields a subsequent state and reward every time it receives an action input. In this manner, trajectories of states, actions, and rewards, often called &quot;&lt;dfn&gt;episodes&lt;/dfn&gt;&quot; may be produced.

Another form of simulator is a &quot;&lt;dfn&gt;generative model&lt;/dfn&gt;&quot;, a single step simulator that can generate samples of the next state and reward given any state and action. (Note that this is a different meaning from the term generative model in the context of statistical classification.) In algorithms that are expressed using pseudocode, formula_46 is often used to represent a generative model. For example, the expression formula_47 might denote the action of sampling from the generative model where formula_5 and formula_7 are the current state and action, and formula_10 and formula_36 are the new state and reward. Compared to an episodic simulator, a generative model has the advantage that it can yield data from any state, not only those encountered in a trajectory.

These model classes form a hierarchy of information content: an explicit model trivially yields a generative model through sampling from the distributions, and repeated application of a generative model yields an episodic simulator. In the opposite direction, it is only possible to learn approximate models through regression. The type of model available for a particular MDP plays a significant role in determining which solution algorithms are appropriate. For example, the dynamic programming algorithms described in the next section require an explicit model, and Monte Carlo tree search requires a generative model (or an episodic simulator that can be copied at any state), whereas most reinforcement learning algorithms require only an episodic simulator.

==Example==

An example of MDP is the Pole-Balancing model, which comes from classic control theory.

In this example, we have

* formula_2 is the set of ordered tuples formula_53 given by pole angle, angular velocity, position of the cart and its speed.
* formula_3 is formula_55, corresponding to applying a force on the left (right) on the cart.
* formula_6 is the transition of the system, which in this case is going to be deterministic and driven by the laws of mechanics.
*formula_16 is formula_34 if the pole is up after the transition, zero otherwise. Therefore, this function only depend on formula_10 in this specific case.

==Algorithms==

Solutions for MDPs with finite state and action spaces may be found through a variety of methods such as dynamic programming. The algorithms in this section apply to MDPs with finite state and action spaces and explicitly given transition probabilities and reward functions, but the basic concepts may be extended to handle other problem classes, for example using function approximation. Also, some processes with countably infinite state and action spaces can be exactly reduced to ones with finite state and action spaces.

The standard family of algorithms to calculate optimal policies for finite state and action MDPs requires storage for two arrays indexed by state: &quot;value&quot; formula_60, which contains real values, and &quot;policy&quot; formula_20, which contains actions. At the end of the algorithm, formula_20 will contain the solution and formula_63 will contain the discounted sum of the rewards to be earned (on average) by following that solution from state formula_5.

The algorithm has two steps, (1) a value update and (2) a policy update, which are repeated in some order for all the states until no further changes take place. Both recursively update a new estimation of the optimal policy and state value using an older estimation of those values.

:formula_65

:formula_66

Their order depends on the variant of the algorithm; one can also do them for all states at once or state by state, and more often to some states than others. As long as no state is permanently excluded from either of the steps, the algorithm will eventually arrive at the correct solution.

===Notable variants===

====Value iteration====
In value iteration , which is also called backward induction,
the formula_20 function is not used; instead, the value of formula_24 is calculated within formula_63 whenever it is needed. Substituting the calculation of formula_24 into the calculation of formula_63 gives the combined step:
:formula_72

where formula_73 is the iteration number. Value iteration starts at formula_74 and formula_75 as a guess of the value function. It then iterates, repeatedly computing formula_76 for all states formula_5, until formula_60 converges with the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side (which is the &quot;Bellman equation&quot; for this problem). Lloyd Shapley&#x27;s 1953 paper on stochastic games included as a special case the value iteration method for MDPs, but this was recognized only later on.

====Policy iteration====
In policy iteration , step one is performed once, and then step two is performed once, then both are repeated until policy converges. Then step one is again performed once and so on. (Policy iteration was invented by Howard to optimize Sears catalogue mailing, which he had been optimizing using value iteration.)

Instead of repeating step two to convergence, it may be formulated and solved as a set of linear equations. These equations are merely obtained by making formula_79 in the step two equation. Thus, repeating step two to convergence can be interpreted as solving the linear equations by relaxation.

This variant has the advantage that there is a definite stopping condition: when the array formula_20 does not change in the course of applying step 1 to all states, the algorithm is completed.

Policy iteration is usually slower than value iteration for a large number of possible states.

====Modified policy iteration====
In modified policy iteration (; ), step one is performed once, and then step two is repeated several times. Then step one is again performed once and so on.

====Prioritized sweeping====
In this variant, the steps are preferentially applied to states which are in some way important – whether based on the algorithm (there were large changes in formula_60 or formula_20 around those states recently) or based on use (those states are near the starting state, or otherwise of interest to the person or program using the algorithm).

===Computational complexity===

Algorithms for finding optimal policies with time complexity polynomial in the size of the problem representation exist for finite MDPs. Thus, decision problems based on MDPs are in computational complexity class P. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, the size of the problem representation is often exponential in the number of state and action variables, limiting exact solution techniques to problems that have a compact representation. In practice, online planning techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search can find useful solutions in larger problems, and, in theory, it is possible to construct online planning algorithms that can find an arbitrarily near-optimal policy with no computational complexity dependence on the size of the state space.

==Extensions and generalizations==
A Markov decision process is a stochastic game with only one player.

===Partial observability===

The solution above assumes that the state formula_5 is known when action is to be taken; otherwise formula_24 cannot be calculated. When this assumption is not true, the problem is called a partially observable Markov decision process or POMDP.

=== Constrained Markov decision processes ===
Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPS) are extensions to Markov decision process (MDPs). There are three fundamental differences between MDPs and CMDPs.

* There are multiple costs incurred after applying an action instead of one.
* CMDPs are solved with linear programs only, and dynamic programming does not work.
* The final policy depends on the starting state.

The method of Lagrange multipliers applies to CMDPs.
Many Lagrangian-based algorithms have been developed.
* Natural policy gradient primal-dual method.

There are a number of applications for CMDPs. It has recently been used in motion planning scenarios in robotics.

===Continuous-time Markov decision process===
In discrete-time Markov Decision Processes, decisions are made at discrete time intervals. However, for continuous-time Markov decision processes, decisions can be made at any time the decision maker chooses. In comparison to discrete-time Markov decision processes, continuous-time Markov decision processes can better model the decision-making process for a system that has continuous dynamics, i.e., the system dynamics is defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These kind of applications raise in queueing systems, epidemic processes, and population processes.

Like the discrete-time Markov decision processes, in continuous-time Markov decision processes the agent aims at finding the optimal &quot;policy&quot; which could maximize the expected cumulated reward. The only difference with the standard case stays in the fact that, due to the continuous nature of the time variable, the sum is replaced by an integral:
:formula_85
where formula_86

====Discrete space: Linear programming formulation====
If the state space and action space are finite, we could use linear programming to find the optimal policy, which was one of the earliest approaches applied. Here we only consider the ergodic model, which means our continuous-time MDP becomes an ergodic continuous-time Markov chain under a stationary policy. Under this assumption, although the decision maker can make a decision at any time in the current state, there is no benefit in taking multiple actions. It is better to take an action only at the time when system is transitioning from the current state to another state. Under some conditions, if our optimal value function formula_87 is independent of state formula_73, we will have the following inequality:
:formula_89
If there exists a function formula_90, then formula_91 will be the smallest formula_92 satisfying the above equation. In order to find formula_91, we could use the following linear programming model:
*Primal linear program(P-LP)
:formula_94
*Dual linear program(D-LP)
:formula_95
formula_96 is a feasible solution to the D-LP if formula_96 is nonnative and satisfied the constraints in the D-LP problem. A feasible solution formula_98 to the D-LP is said to be an optimal solution if
:formula_99
for all feasible solution formula_96 to the D-LP. Once we have found the optimal solution formula_98, we can use it to establish the optimal policies.

====Continuous space: Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation====
In continuous-time MDP, if the state space and action space are continuous, the optimal criterion could be found by solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation. In order to discuss the HJB equation, we need to reformulate
our problem
:formula_102

formula_103 is the terminal reward function, formula_104 is the system state vector, formula_105 is the system control vector we try to find. formula_106 shows how the state vector changes over time. The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is as follows:
:formula_107
We could solve the equation to find the optimal control formula_105, which could give us the optimal value function formula_87

==Reinforcement learning==
Reinforcement learning is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control that has, as main objective, finding an approximately optimal policy for MDPs where transition probabilities and rewards are unknown.

Reinforcement learning can solve Markov-Decision processes without explicit specification of the transition probabilities which are instead needed to perform policy iteration. In this setting, transition probabilities and rewards must be learned from experience, i.e. by letting an agent interact with the MDP for a given number of steps. Both on a theoretical and on a practical level, effort is put in maximizing the sample efficiency, i.e. minimimizing the number of samples needed to learn a policy whose performance is formula_110close to the optimal one (due to the stochastic nature of the process, learning the optimal policy with a finite number of samples is, in general, impossible).

===Reinforcement Learning for discrete MDPs===
For the purpose of this section, it is useful to define a further function, which corresponds to taking the action formula_7 and then continuing optimally (or according to whatever policy one currently has):
:formula_112

While this function is also unknown, experience during learning is based on formula_113 pairs (together with the outcome formula_10; that is, &quot;I was in state formula_5 and I tried doing formula_7 and formula_10 happened&quot;). Thus, one has an array formula_118 and uses experience to update it directly. This is known as Q-learning.

==Other scopes==

=== Learning automata ===

Another application of MDP process in machine learning theory is called learning automata. This is also one type of reinforcement learning if the environment is stochastic. The first detail learning automata paper is surveyed by Narendra and Thathachar (1974), which were originally described explicitly as finite-state automata. Similar to reinforcement learning, a learning automata algorithm also has the advantage of solving the problem when probability or rewards are unknown. The difference between learning automata and Q-learning is that the former technique omits the memory of Q-values, but updates the action probability directly to find the learning result. Learning automata is a learning scheme with a rigorous proof of convergence.

In learning automata theory, a stochastic automaton consists of:
* a set &quot;x&quot; of possible inputs,
* a set Φ = { Φ1, ..., Φ&quot;s&quot; } of possible internal states,
* a set α = { α1, ..., α&quot;r&quot; } of possible outputs, or actions, with &quot;r&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;,
* an initial state probability vector &quot;p&quot;(0) = ≪ &quot;p&quot;1(0), ..., &quot;ps&quot;(0) ≫,
* a computable function &quot;A&quot; which after each time step &quot;t&quot; generates &quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot; + 1) from &quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), the current input, and the current state, and
* a function &quot;G&quot;: Φ → α which generates the output at each time step.
The states of such an automaton correspond to the states of a &quot;discrete-state discrete-parameter Markov process&quot;. At each time step &quot;t&quot; = 0,1,2,3..., the automaton reads an input from its environment, updates P(&quot;t&quot;) to P(&quot;t&quot; + 1) by &quot;A&quot;, randomly chooses a successor state according to the probabilities P(&quot;t&quot; + 1) and outputs the corresponding action. The automaton&#x27;s environment, in turn, reads the action and sends the next input to the automaton.

===Category theoretic interpretation===
Other than the rewards, a Markov decision process formula_119 can be understood in terms of Category theory. Namely, let formula_120 denote the free monoid with generating set &quot;A&quot;. Let Dist denote the Kleisli category of the Giry monad. Then a functor formula_121 encodes both the set &quot;S&quot; of states and the probability function &quot;P&quot;.

In this way, Markov decision processes could be generalized from monoids (categories with one object) to arbitrary categories. One can call the result formula_122 a &quot;context-dependent Markov decision process&quot;, because moving from one object to another in formula_123 changes the set of available actions and the set of possible states.

==Alternative notations==
The terminology and notation for MDPs are not entirely settled. There are two main streams — one focuses on maximization problems from contexts like economics, using the terms action, reward, value, and calling the discount factor or , while the other focuses on minimization problems from engineering and navigation, using the terms control, cost, cost-to-go, and calling the discount factor . In addition, the notation for the transition probability varies.

In addition, transition probability is sometimes written formula_124, formula_125 or, rarely, formula_126

Donna Burke (born 1964) is an Australian actress, singer, and businesswoman. She voiced Angela Orosco in &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; (2001), which is considered one of the greatest games ever made. She also voiced Claudia Wolf in &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; (2003), and has performed songs for the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series.

==Biography==
Burke graduated from Edith Cowan University. Her education included &quot;operatic voice, speech and drama&quot; and she received classical voice training for ten years.

From 1989 to 1995, Burke taught Media, English and Religious Education to senior students at Chisholm Catholic College. She moved to Japan in 1996 and initially worked as a teacher of English before obtaining some recording work.

Burke married Bill Benfield, a British former teacher. In 2004, Burke and Benfield started a record label, Dagmusic, which catered for foreign artists. Burke released her debut album, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, through Dagmusic.

Burke has worked as a freelance announcer at NHK since 1999. She is also the lyricist for numerous Japanese TV commercials, anime songs and J-pop group tunes.

Burke created Hotteeze in 2004, a company she created to export Japanese heat pads worldwide.

==Voice work==
Burke&#x27;s voice has been used in Japan since 2005 for announcements on the Tokaido, Sanyo, and Kyushu Shinkansen bullet train system. Her voice is also used in Narita Airport Delta lounges and in English language guidance for the Emperor Showa Memorial Museum.

In 2007, Burke narrated a documentary titled &quot;Climate in Crisis - Part 1&quot;, which won the 2007 silver medal for Environment/Ecology at the New York Television Festival and the 2007 Earth Vision Award at the Tokyo Global Environmental Film Festival.

<doc id="1125900" wikidata="Q1761169" url="?curid=1125900" title="Bites (album)">
<text>Bites is the first full-length studio album by Canadian industrial band Skinny Puppy, released as an LP through Nettwerk in 1985. It was reissued in 1993 on CD with additional material compiled from cassette releases, international releases, and previously undistributed tracks. The cover art was designed by Steven R. Gilmore.

&quot;Bites&quot; was certified gold by Music Canada on August 5, 1994.

==Background==

The first CD release of &quot;Bites&quot; was on the compilation &quot;Bites and Remission&quot; in 1987. This release replaced the songs &quot;Assimilate&quot; and &quot;The Choke&quot; with remixed versions and it did not include all of the tracks featured on the earlier cassette release, which was significantly longer. A similar but distinct CD called &quot;Remission &amp; Bites&quot; was released by Play It Again Sam in Europe during the same year. On the 1993 reissue, the song &quot;One Day&quot; is not listed anywhere in the artwork or credits.

The Tear Garden&#x27;s self-titled EP from 1986 (one year after &quot;Bites&quot; originally saw release) includes a revised version of &quot;The Centre Bullet&quot; featuring vocals by Edward Ka-Spel, slightly retitled to &quot;The Center Bullet.&quot; The two songs are identical save for the presence of vocals by The Legendary Pink Dots singer. Late reissues of The Tear Garden album &quot;Tired Eyes Slowly Burning&quot; also feature that version of &quot;The Center Bullet&quot;. Having both been made by cEvin Key and Dave Ogilvie, it is unclear whether the track was originally a creation of Skinny Puppy or of The Tear Garden.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine recommended &quot;Bites&quot;, calling it a &quot;strong club collection a la Kraftwerk&quot;. Tom Harrison of &quot;The Province&quot; gave the album a favorable review, calling it &quot;willfully ugly and menacing&quot;, and described its songs as &quot;cleanly produced&quot; and &quot;carefully textured&quot;. Tim DiGravina of AllMusic was also receptive, calling the album a &quot;fascinating look at Skinny Puppy in embryonic form&quot;, and described its sound as &quot;delicate and pristine&quot;. DiGravina also noted the influence of groups such as Depeche Mode, Human League, and Cabaret Voltaire.

Mike Abrams of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; thought &quot;Bites&quot; was depressing and for people with &quot;undiscriminating tastes&quot;. He named the songs &quot;Assimilate&quot; and &quot;Last Call&quot; as the album&#x27;s best tracks. James Muretich of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; was less impressed with &quot;Bites&quot;, calling the record &quot;annoying&quot; and likened the band to robots.

In 1999, &quot;Chart&quot; magazine listed &quot;Bites&quot; among the most influential Canadian albums of the 1980s.

In 2023 the album was the recipient of the Heritage Public Prize at the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.

<text>Real Club Deportivo España, Real España, nicknamed &quot;Los Aurinegros&quot; or simply España, is a Honduran professional football club, which plays in the Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Honduras. With 12 championships, Real España is one of the most accomplished Honduran football clubs. Their title of &#x27;Real&#x27; (Spanish for &#x27;Royal&#x27;) was awarded by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1977.

They are based in San Pedro Sula, Cortés, and their home venue is the Estadio General Francisco Morazán.

==History==
Real España was founded on 14 July 1929 at &quot;Escuela Ramón Rosa, de San Pedro Sula&quot; by Pastor Reyes, Erick Mejía Handal, Juan Banegas, &quot;Teco&quot; Lardizábal, Hugo Escoto Soto, and Leonardo Muñoz as Club Deportivo España.

Their professional history begins in 1965–66, with the founding of the Honduran national league. For most of the league&#x27;s first decade, &quot;Los Aurinegros&quot; were a mid-table side. However, in the early 1970s, things began to change. The team was anchored by defender Jaime Villegas, who would play for Real España from 1970 to 1986, and make a club record 306 appearances. In 1974, the addition of two new faces, goalkeeper Julio César Arzú and striker Jimmy James Bailey, turned the team into title contenders for the first time. The team finished third in the regular season&#x27;s table, which was good enough to qualify them for a quadrangular tournament, a round robin with the league&#x27;s top four teams. Real España won this phase, forcing a championship playoff with regular season champions Motagua. Antonio Pavón Molina scored the lone goal of their 1–0 victory, making &quot;Los Aurinegros&quot; champions of Honduras for the very first time.

In 1975, &quot;la Máquina&quot; got even stronger. They added a defensive midfielder named Gilberto Yearwood, who would eventually be considered one of the greatest Honduran players of all time. On the pitch, they enjoyed similar results, finishing third in the regular table, winning the quadrangular playoff, and earning a championship playoff with Olimpia. The teams drew the first leg 0–0, but Real España won the second leg 2–0, with goals from Alberto Ferreira da Silva and Yearwood.

1976 saw the club achieved greater success. They won the regular season championship with 38 points (15 wins in 27 matches) and only narrowly finished second to Motagua in the quadrangular (had they won, there would have been no need for a championship playoff). In the resulting playoff, the teams drew 0–0 in the first leg, played at Motagua&#x27;s stadium in Tegucigalpa. Back in San Pedro Sula, the story was different. Real España dominated, winning the match 4–1 and clinching their third straight championship. It was known as &quot;el tricampeon&quot;, and it was the first such accomplishment in the history of Honduran soccer (it would not be equalled until Olimpia managed it in the late 1990s).

After this, international attention was descending on the club for the first time. Yearwood, who had starred in the 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship for Honduras, moved abroad and would spend ten years playing in Spain&#x27;s La Liga. King Juan Carlos I of Spain bestowed the Real title on the club the following summer. Things were looking up.

In 1977, the club set out in search of an unprecedented fourth consecutive title. They finished third in the regular season and won the quadrangular, only to bow 2–0 to Olimpia in the championship playoff. They reached the championship round again in 1978–79, but were once again defeated, this time by Motagua. Then, in 1979, disaster. Real España&#x27;s form collapsed and they plummeted to 8th in the league. Worse, crosstown rivals Marathón won the championship.

They set out to remedy this in 1980, winning the regular season championship with 14 wins in 27 matches. In the pentagonal round robin, though, things became complex—Olimpia, Marathón, and Real España were all tied at the top of the table, forcing a second round-robin among those three. Real España had the chance to win the championship then and there, but after every match ended in a draw, the pentagonal title was awarded to Marathón on goal difference. That set up an all-San Pedro Sula championship match.

The teams split the first two legs, forcing a decisive third playoff match. With all of San Pedro Sula watching in anticipation, Real brought home their fourth title by a 2–1 scoreline. This was the end of Real&#x27;s golden era. Their glory side was beginning to age, and Olimpia was ascending to the dominant heights of Honduran football. It was not until the late 1980s that a revival would begin.

After near misses in 1986 and 1987, Real reclaimed their glory in 1988 by winning the regular season championship and then beating Olimpia in an extra time playoff final to claim their fifth title. 1989–90 saw the two teams meet again in the championship final, which ended level; Olimpia was awarded the crown on the basis of a superior regular season record. Real, however, was not finished—they came right back by beating Motagua 2–1 to win the 1990–91 championship. Rodolfo Richardson Smith was the hero, scoring a double in the second leg of the finals. &quot;La máquina&quot; only narrowly missed a second consecutive crown when they bowed to Motagua in the 1991–92 title match.

Two years later, in 1993–94, Real España hoisted their seventh championship in the most dominant style of all, by winning both the regular season and triangular playoff. No championship match was necessary in this most impressive season; out of 31 domestic matches, &quot;la maquina&quot; had lost just once. The leader of the charge that season was Carlos Pavón, an 18-year-old striker who was attracting all sorts of international attention. Pavón would leave after the season to spend a decade abroad, playing in Mexico and Italy. Real, meanwhile, entered a decade long title drought.

Their return to glory came in Apertura 2003, under the managerial leadership of Juan de Dios Castillo. Castillo had built his team around two Brazilian strikers, Pedrinho and Luciano Emilio, and it was successful. Luciano Emilio won the league scoring title, and each scored in the championship final, which saw Real España defeat Olimpia 4–2 on aggregate.

However, the glory was fleeting. Diaz Castillo left for Marathon, while Olimpia signed Luciano Emilio and used his talents to win four out of the next five titles. Those were frustrating times, as Real missed the championship playoffs four tournaments in a row. It was not until Clausura 2007 that the club returned to form.

Under Mexican manager José Treviño, the club won the regular season title and advanced to the playoffs. Treviño had a strong team--Carlos Pavón had returned from Europe, and was joined at striker by Milton Núñez and the Brazilian Esvaldo Ferreira. A victory over Motagua earned them a berth in the finals against crosstown rivals Marathon. Marathon won the first leg, 2–1, which set up a dramatic championship showdown. With just thirteen minutes left in the last leg, the teams were level, 1–1, which would have given Marathon a win on aggregate. However, Milton Núñez scored a brilliant goal to even the tie, then used his perfect aerial pass to set up Ferreira for the winning goal. Real España were champions of Honduras for the ninth time.

The club finished runners up in both Apertura 2008 and Clausura 2009, but returned to the top in dramatic style in Apertura 2010. A double from attacking midfielder Luis Lobo lifted the club to a semi-final win over Marathon, and in the finals they defeated Olimpia in extra time. They won it again in Apertura 2013, beating Real Sociedad on penalties, and then again in Apertura 2017, holding off Motagua in extra time.

==Colors and badge==

España&#x27;s colours are black and yellow, a fact reflected in the club&#x27;s nickname: &quot;Aurinegros&quot; (a compound word meaning gold and black). The club logo was changed in 2006 to give a younger, more fresh look. The club mascot has changed many times. It has been a yellow and black owl, a train, and most recently a robot. The crown symbolizes the &quot;royal status&quot; granted to the club by the King of Spain. This is noticeable in other clubs such as Real Madrid, Real Sociedad, Real Betis, Real Murcia, Real Valladolid and Real Zaragoza.

Kelme is the team&#x27;s official sportswear manufacturer.

==Stadium==

Real España plays their home matches at the Estadio Francisco Morazán. It has been Real España&#x27;s home stadium since its creation. In 2008, Real España played all their home games at the Estadio Olímpico due to the Estadio Morazán&#x27;s renewal.

==Club rivalries==

===Clásico Moderno (Honduras)===

El Clásico Moderno (The Modern Derby) also referred by some as the Clasico Moderno Hondureño is a Honduran football match played at least four times a year in the Liga Nacional de Honduras and consists of two teams, C.D. Olimpia and Real C.D. España.

===Clásico Sampedrano===

El Clásico Sampedrano (The Sampedran Derby) is a Honduran football match played at least four times a year in the
Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Honduras and consists of two teams, Marathón and Real España. These two teams are from San Pedro Sula, hence the name. Marathon has run away numerous times. Including from a 6-1 defeat at Estadio Yankel Mierdero.

===Motagua–Real España football rivalry===

The Motagua–Real España classic is not as fierce as the other two already mentioned as these both teams have a good relationship with each other from the players, to the board and the fans; however they had played six intense league finals, three won by each side.
